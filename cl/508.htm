<h4 align="center"></h4><p>508、⑵这种淫欲既热爱异性，同时又憎恶异性。他们之所以对异性有爱，是因为这是多样化的源头；他们之所以对异性又有憎恶，是因为他们品尝过后就会抛弃这个女人，把他们的淫欲转向其他女人。这种下流的淫欲只对一个新女人燃烧；但一旦燃烧起来，就对她变得冷淡，而冷淡就是憎恶。这种淫欲既是对异性的一种爱，同时又是对异性的一种憎恶；对此，我们可以这样来证明：把他们尝过的这组女人放在左边，未尝过的那组女人放在右边；他们岂不会出于爱看待后者，出于憎恶看待前者吗？然而，这两组人都是由女性构成的。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>508、（2）这种情欲一方面爱异性，另一方面又污辱异性。它包含着对异性的爱是因为异性中有着不同的人。它包含着对异性的污辱是因为男人在得手之后就会将女人抛弃而去追求另外一个。当对一个女人的热情冷却时，这种冷却就成了一种污辱。</p><p>在此证明一下，想象这种男从有一群被他们抛弃的女人在爱他们左边，还有一群他们没有碰过的女人在他们的右边。他们难道不会对右边的一群充满爱而污辱左边的一群人吗？</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #508 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>508. (ii) This lust is at once love and loathing for the other sex.<p>They have a love for the other sex because this is the source of variety, and they have a loathing for the other sex because they cast them off once they have made love to them and transfer their lust to other women. This obscene lust blazes up for a new woman, but once it has blazed it becomes cool towards her; and coldness is loathing. We can illustrate how this lust is at once love and loathing for the other sex. Put on the left a group of women whom they have made love to, and on the right a group whom they have not; would they not look on the latter with love, the other with loathing? Yet either group is part of the female sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #508 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>508. 2. This lust involves a love for the opposite sex and at the same time a loathing for it. It involves a love for the opposite sex because the opposite sex provides the variety, and it involves a loathing for the sex because once men of this character have tasted any of them they cast them away and go lusting after others. This obscene lust burns for a new woman, but after its heat is spent grows cold to her; and the coldness is loathing.<p>We can illustrate the fact that this lust involves a love for the opposite sex and at the same time a loathing for it in the following way. Imagine such men having a group of the women they have tasted to their left, and a group of women they have not tasted to their right. Would they not look upon the latter with love, and upon the first with loathing? And yet each group would be composed of the opposite sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #508 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>508. 2. This lust is a love, and at the same time a loathing, for the other sex. For them this is love for the other sex, because the other sex provides the variety, and it is a loathing for the other sex, because after one taste they abandon a woman and lust for others. This repulsive lust burns for the new woman and, after the heat, grows cold toward her. Coldness is loathing.<p>Here is how to illustrate that this lust is love for the other sex and loathing at the same time. On the left put a crowd of women they have already enjoyed and on the right a crowd they have not enjoyed. They will view one group with loathing but the other with love, won't they? Yet both groups are members of the feminine sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #508 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>508. II. THAT THIS LUST IS A LOVE FOR THE SEX AND AT THE SAME TIME A LOATHING. They have love for the sex because from the sex is variety; and they have loathing for the sex because after the first taste they cast the woman off and direct their lust to others. This obscene lust burns towards a new woman, and after the heat, grows cold to her, and the cold is a loathing. That the lust is a love for the sex and at the same time a loathing may be illustrated thus: Place on the left hand a company of those women they have tasted, and on the right a company of those they have not tasted; would they not look upon the latter from love, and upon the former from loathing? yet both companies consist of the sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #508 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>508. (ii) This lust is at once love and loathing for the sex. These men feel love for the sex because they love a variety of the sex, and they feel loathing because after a taste they cast the women off and lust for others. This obscene lust burns toward a new woman, and then grows frigid toward her; and cold is loathing. The fact that this lust is at once love and loathing for the sex may be illustrated thus: suppose one placed at the left a company of women whom such men have tasted, and on the right a company of women whom they have not tasted, would they not regard the latter with love, but the former with loathing? Yet each is a company of the sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #508 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>508. (2) That this lust is love and at the same time a loathing of the sex. They have a love for the sex because there is variety from the sex, and they have a loathing for the sex because after the first enjoyment they cast the woman off and lust for others. This obscene lust rages with heat towards a new woman, and after the heat, becomes cold to her, and cold is loathing. That this lust is love and at the same time loathing for the sex may be illustrated thus: Place on the left hand a company of those that they have enjoyed, and on the right a company of those whom they have not enjoyed. Would they not look upon these with love and upon those with loathing? And yet each company is of the sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #508 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>508. II. Quod Libido illa sit amor et simul fastidium pro sexu. Est illis amor pro sexu quia ex sexu est varietas, et est fastidium pro sexu, quia post libamen rejiciunt, ac libidinantur ad alias: obscoena haec libido aestuat ad foeminam novam, et post aestum frigescit ad illam; ac frigus est fastidium. Quod Libido illa sit amor et simul fastidium pro sexu, illustrari potest ita; pone a parte sinistra cohortem ex libatis ab illis, et a parte dextra cohortem ex non libatis, numne hanc aspicerent ex amore, illam autem ex fastidio; et tamen utraque cohors est sexus. </p>
