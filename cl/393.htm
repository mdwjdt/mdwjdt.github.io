<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>393、⑹该气场主要感染女性，因而感染母亲，并通过她们感染男性或父亲。这是出于前面所说（223节）的那个源头的一个结果，即：婚姻之爱的气场由女人接受，并通过女人传给男人，因为女人生来就是对男人理解的爱，而理解是接受者。对孩子的爱也一样，因为这爱的起源来自婚姻之爱。众所周知，母亲对孩子的爱最温柔，父亲的次之。对孩子的爱被铭刻在女人与生俱来的婚姻之爱上，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：女孩子对小婴儿和布娃娃表现出喜爱和友善的情感，她们会随身带着布娃娃，打扮、亲吻它们，把它们抱在怀里；而男孩子就没有这种情感。<br><br>表面上看，母亲获得对孩子的爱似乎是因为在子宫内以自己的血液滋养婴儿，因而婴儿将母亲的生命变成自己的，他们之间从而有一种怜悯的联结。而事实上，这并非那爱的起源，因为假如分娩之后，在母亲毫无知觉的情况下，用另一个孩子替换她自己的孩子，她仍当自己的孩子那样温柔爱它。此外，有时保姆比母亲还要爱孩子。从这些考虑可推知，对孩子的爱唯源于植入每个女人的婚姻之爱；对怀孕的爱与这爱联在一起，其快乐促使妻子预备接受婴儿。这是这爱的第一个阶段，分娩后，这爱及其快乐就完全转到婴儿身上。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>393、（6）这种氛围主要是影响女性，即妈妈们，并通过他们而影响男性。</p><p>这与从前223节中讲过的一样，婚姻之爱是由女人接收并通过女人而传入到男人中，因为女人生来是对男人理解力的爱的形式，理解力是它的接收者。对小孩子的爱也是同样的，因为它来自于婚姻之爱。</p><p>事实证明，对小孩子的爱是刻入婚姻之爱并存在于女人中，这可以从小女孩对小孩的爱中看出，小女孩娃娃，总会拿着娃娃，给娃穿衣服，拍拍她们等。而男孩子却不同。</p><p>看上去母亲对孩子的爱好象是由于她自己用血液养育了孩子，并由孩子融入了她们的生活。但这并非是这种爱的来源。比如，若在母亲不知的情况下，将出生后的小孩交换了，母亲还会象爱自己的孩子一样去爱他。另外，有时候，照顾孩子的人会比孩子的父母更爱孩子。</p><p>由此可见这种爱只有来自于根植于女人身上的婚姻之爱，与此相联的是女人对孕育孩子的爱。这就是最初的这种爱，并且在生育后传给孩子。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #393 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>393. (vi) This sphere chiefly affects the female sex, that is, mothers, but is passed on by them to the male sex, that is, to fathers.<p>This follows as coming from the same source as previously mentioned [<a href="223.htm">223</a>]; the sphere of conjugial love is received by women, and transferred by them into men, because women are destined by birth to be loves of men's intellects, and the intellect is a receiver. It is much the same with the love of children, because it is in origin from conjugial love. It is well known that mothers have the tenderest love for children, fathers not so tender a love. It is clear that the love of children is imprinted on conjugial love, to which women are destined by birth, from the fact that girls show a kindly and sociable affection for small children, and for dolls which they carry around, clothe, kiss and hug to their bosoms. Boys do not show this affection.</p><p>[2] It might seem as if mothers get their love of children from nurturing them with their blood in the womb, so that they make their mother's life their own and are sympathetically united. But in fact this is not the source of that love, since if without the mother's knowledge another baby were, after it is born, to be substituted for her real child, it would be just as tenderly loved as if it were her own. Moreover, children are sometimes loved more by their nurses than by their mothers. It follows from these observations that this love can come from no other source than the conjugial love implanted in every woman; and the love of conceiving is associated with it, its pleasure preparing a wife to receive it. This is the first stage of this love, and after childbirth it is fully transferred with its pleasure to the child. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #393 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>393. 6. This atmosphere affects the feminine sex primarily, thus mothers, and the masculine sex or fathers from them. This stems from the same cause as discussed previously, <sup >1</sup>that the atmosphere of conjugial love is received by women and communicated through women to men, for the reason that women are born forms of love for the understanding of men, and the understanding is its recipient. It is the same with a love of little children, because this originates from conjugial love. People know that mothers have a very tender love for little children, and fathers a less tender one.<p>Evidence that a love of little children is engraved on the conjugial love into which women come by birth is apparent from the loving and friendly affection of girls for little children, and for the dolls which they carry, dress, kiss and clasp to their bosoms. Boys do not have the same affection.</p><p>[2] It appears as though mothers acquire a love of little children from their having nourished them in the womb with their own blood, and from the children's consequent assimilation of their life, and so from a sympathetic union between them. But this is nevertheless not the origin of that love, since, if, without the mother's knowing, another child were substituted after the birth in place of the true one, she would love it with equal tenderness as if it were her own. Moreover, little children are sometimes loved more by their nurses than by their mothers.<p>From these considerations it follows that this love derives from no other source than the conjugial love implanted in every woman, to which has been adjoined a love of conceiving, the delight of which causes a wife to be prepared for reception. This is the first beginning of that love, which after the birth passes with its delight in fullness to the child.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See no. <a href="223.htm">223</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #393 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>393. 6. This aura affects the feminine sex - that is, mothers - especially, and through them it affects the masculine sex, or fathers. This comes from the same source mentioned earlier - that women receive the aura of married love and it carries over to men through women, because women are born loves of men's intellect, and intellect is a vessel. It is the same with the love for children because this love arises from the love in marriage.<p>Everyone knows that mothers have a more tender love for children, and fathers have a less tender love. Love for children is etched on the love of marriage that women are born with. This is clear from the loving and friendly affection that girls have for babies and for dolls that they carry, dress, kiss, and hug to their chest. Boys do not have such affection.<p>It seems as if mothers get their love for children from nourishing them by their own blood in utero and from taking on their life this way, thus from a sympathetic union. Still, this is not the source of this love, since if another baby were substituted after birth for the right one, without the mother's knowing it, she would love it as tenderly as if it were her own. Besides, nurses sometimes love babies more than the mothers do.<p>From these considerations it follows that this love comes from nowhere but the love of marriage implanted in every woman.<p>Joined to it is a love of conceiving. The joy of this love makes a wife receptive. This is the beginning of the love that comes across to the offspring, fully, with its joy, after birth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #393 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>393. VI. THAT THIS SPHERE AFFECTS THE FEMALE SEX, THUS MOTHERS, PRINCIPALLY, AND THE MALE SEX, OR FATHERS, FROM THEM. This is a consequence due to the same origin that was previously spoken of [no. <a href="223.htm">223</a>], namely, that the sphere of conjugial love is received by women, and through women is transferred to men, and this because women are born loves of the understanding of men and the understanding is a recipient. It is the same with the love of infants, the origin of this love being from conjugial love. That mothers have a more tender love of infants, and fathers a less tender, is well known. That the love of infants is inscribed on the conjugial love into which women are born, is manifest from the loving and friendly affection which girls have for infants and for their dolls which they carry about, dress, kiss, and press to their bosoms. Boys have no such affection.</p><p>[2] It appears as if mothers have the love of infants from having nourished them in the womb with their own blood, and so from their appropriation of their own life; thus from a sympathetic union. Yet this is not the origin of that love, for if, after the birth and unknown to the mother, another infant were substituted for the true one, it would be loved with equal tenderness as if it were her own. Moreover, sometimes infants are loved by their nurses more than by their mothers.<p>It follows from the above, that this love is from no other source than the conjugial love implanted in every woman. To this is adjoined the love of conceiving, by reason of the delight of which, the wife is prepared for reception. This is the first stage of that love. After the birth, it passes completely over into the babe, and with it its delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #393 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>393. (vi) This sphere affects the female sex primarily, thus mothers, and through them the male sex, or fathers. This has the origin of which we spoke above, namely, that the sphere of marital love is received by women and transmitted by them to men, the women being born loves of men's understanding, and the understanding being a recipient. It is similar with love of children, as this has its origin in marital love. It is known that mothers have a very tender love for children, and fathers a less tender. The inscription of the love of children on the marital love into which women are born, is evident in the loving and sociable affection of girls for little children and for the images of them, too, which they carry about, dress, fondle and press to their bosoms. Boys have no such affection. Mothers seem to love infants as a result of having nourished them in the womb with their own blood and thus from their life's having been appropriated and so from sympathetic union; yet this is not the origin of that love, for if, unknown to the mother, another child were substituted after birth for the true child, it would be loved with as much tenderness as if it were her own. Nurses, moreover, sometimes love little children much more than the mothers do. It follows from these considerations that this love has no other source than the marital love implanted in woman, to which a love of conceiving is adjoined, by the delight of which the wife is made receptive; such is the initial stage of that love for children which on the birth passes with its joy to the new life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #393 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>393. (6) That this sphere principally affects the female sex, thus mothers, and the male sex, or fathers, from them. This comes from the same origin spoken of before, that the sphere of conjugial love is received by women, and through women is transferred into men, because women are born loves of the understanding of men and the understanding is the recipient. It is similar with the love of infants, because this by origin is from conjugial love. That mothers have a more tender and fathers a less tender love is known. That the love of infants is inscribed upon conjugial love into which women are born, is manifest from the lovely and winning affection of little girls for infants, and for the images of them which they carry about, dress, kiss, and press to their bosoms. Boys have no such affection. It appears as if mothers have the love of infants from the nourishing of them in the womb out of their own blood, and thence the appropriation to them of their own life, and thus from sympathetic union; but yet this is not the origin of that love, for if, unknown to the mother, another infant were substituted for the true one after birth, it would be loved with equal tenderness as if it were her own. Besides, infants are sometimes loved by nurses more than by their mothers. It flows from these considerations, that this love is from no other source than the conjugial love inherent in every woman, to which is adjoined the love of conceiving, from the delight of which the wife is prepared for reception; this is the first of that love, which after the birth with its delight, passes over fully to the offspring. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #393 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>393. VI. Quod haec Sphaera afficiat sexum foemininum principaliter, ita matres, et sexum masculinum seu patres ab illis. Hoc sequitur ex eadem origine, de qua prius, quod Sphaera amoris conjugialis recipiatur a foeminis, et per foeminas transferatur in viros, ex causa, quia foeminae natae sunt amores intellectus virorum, ac intellectus est recipiens: simile est cum amore infantum, quia hic originitus est ex amore conjugiali: quod matribus tenerrimus amor infantum sit, ac patribus minus tener, notum est. Quod amori conjugiali, in quem natae sunt foeminae, amor infantum inscriptus sit, patet a puellarum amabili et consociabili affectione ad infantes, et ad imagines illarum, quas portant, amiciunt, osculantur, ac sinubus pectoris sui admovent; talis affectio pueris non est.</p><p>[2] Apparet, sicut amor infantum sit matribus ex nutritione illorum in utero ex suo sanguine, et inde ex appropriatione suae vitae, et sic ex unione sympathica; sed usque haec illius amoris origo non est, quoniam si nesciente matre supponeretur alius infans post partum loco genuini, amaretur ille pari teneritate, qua si foret suus; insuper infantes quandoque a nutricibus amantur, plusquam a matribus: ex his fluit, quod amor ille non aliunde sit, quam ex amore conjugiali cuivis foeminae insito, cui adjunctus est amor concipiendi, ex cujus jucundo uxor praeparatur ad receptionem; hoc primum illius amoris est, quod cum suo jucundo post partum plene transit in foetum. </p>
