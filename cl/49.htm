<h4 align="center"></h4><p>49、⑸若能共同生活，他们仍是婚姻伴侣，否则，就会分开，有时是丈夫离开妻子，有时是妻子离开丈夫，有时彼此都离开。死后发生分离的原因在于，世上的结合很少基于对爱情的内在觉察，而是基于对爱情的外在觉察，而外在觉察掩盖了内在觉察。对爱情的外在觉察起因并源于诸如属乎爱世界、爱身体之类的事物。爱世界主要涉及财富和财产，爱身体主要涉及尊严和名声。除此之外，还包括各种有吸引力的诱惑，如姿色、伪装的优雅举止，有时甚至是不贞。而且，婚姻还受制于地域，人出生和所生活的城市或城镇。在这种情况下，婚姻没有选择的余地，只能被限制在相识的家族，以及身份地位相匹配的人当中。正因如此，世上的婚姻绝大多数是外在的，而非同时是内在的，尽管构成婚姻的是灵魂的内在结合。然而，在人死后脱去外在、披上内在之前，这种结合无法被觉察到。这就是为何死后夫妻会有分离，随后会与相似和同类者产生新结合的原因，除非在世时就有灵魂的结合。若人从青年时代就通过主热爱、渴望、寻求与一个伴侣的合法、匹配的婚姻，并唾弃、拒绝放荡的情欲侵入他们的鼻孔，这种灵魂的结合是有可能的。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>49、（5）若夫妻两人可能继续在一起，他们就会在一起。但是若是不可能在一起，他们就会分别，有时丈夫离开妻子，有时妻子离开丈夫，有些夫妻俩彼远离对方。彼此分别的原因是在世间时的结合不是建立在对爱的内在的理解之上，而是建立在对爱的外在的理解之上，这种外在的理解掩盖了内在的爱。</p><p>对爱的外在的理解源于对尘世和对自我的爱。对尘世的爱主要是对财富资产的爱。对自我的爱体现为对地位和荣誉的爱。除此之外，婚姻还会源于其它方面的诱惑，比如漂亮的容貌，假装出来的优雅的举止，有时还会有不纯洁的其它方面的引诱。</p><p>另外，婚姻还有地域上的限制。限制在一个人所在的城镇地区之内。这种情况下选择的余地就限制在家人所认识的与自己地位相似的人的范围内。</p><p>由此，在世间的婚姻大多数是外在的婚姻，而不是内在的婚姻。尽管内在的结合即灵魂的结合才是真正的婚姻。内在的结合只有人死后，脱去外在的特征而展现出本质时才会明显的体现出来。</p><p>这就是为什么夫妻相互分别，而与其他的与自己本质相似的人结合。只有那些从青年时就热爱并遵守主，只有一个配偶并坚决排斥色欲的人才能在其婚姻中有内在上的结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #49 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>49. (v) If they are able to live together, they remain a married couple. But if not they part, sometimes the husband leaving the wife, sometimes the wife leaving the husband, and sometimes each leaving by mutual agreement.<p>The reason for separations taking place after death is that the unions which happen on earth are rarely due to any inward perception of love, but to an outward perception which conceals the inward one. The outward perception of love is caused by and derived from considerations of love of the world and the body. Considerations of love of the world are chiefly wealth and possessions; of love of the body, rank and honours. In addition to these there are various enticements, such as beauty and a pretence of good behaviour, in some cases even unchastity. Moreover, marriages are usually contracted within the district, city or town where the person is born and lives, where only restricted choice is possible, limited to the households of one's acquaintance, and to those among them of similar station to oneself. That is why most marriages contracted in the world are outward, and not inward ones at the same time. Yet it is inward union, the union of souls, which really makes a marriage. This union cannot be perceived before a person puts off the exterior and puts on the interior, and this happens after death. This then is the reason why separations take place at that time, followed by new unions with similar persons or of the same type, unless such a union had been provided on earth. This can happen in the case of those who from youth up have loved, wished for and begged the Lord for a lawful and agreeable match with one partner, rejecting and turning up their noses at shifting lusts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #49 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>49. 5. If it is possible for married partners to live together, they remain partners. But if it is not possible, they separate, the husband sometimes separating from the wife, the wife sometimes from the husband, and both of them sometimes from each other. The reason separations occur after death is that unions formed on earth are seldom formed on the basis of any internal perception of love, but as the result of an external perception which conceals the internal one.<p>An external perception of love takes its cause and origin from such things as have to do with love of the world and love of one's own person. Love of the world is concerned primarily with wealth and possessions, and love of one's own person with positions of rank and honor. In addition to these, there are also various other attractions that entice into marriage, such as good looks and a pretended elegance of manners. Sometimes even a lack of chastity attracts.<p>Furthermore, marriages are also contracted in the area, city or town of one's birth or residence, where the only choice possible is confined and limited to the households one knows, and there only with people of a station matching one's own.<p>As a result, marriages entered into in the world are for the most part external marriages, and not at the same time internal, even though it is the internal union or union of souls that makes a real marriage. And that internal union is not discernible until a person has put off his external character and taken on his internal character, which happens after death.<p>That, now, is why separations then occur, followed by new unions formed with partners of a similar and compatible nature - unless unions like this were provided on earth, which happens in the case of people who from their youth had loved, desired and sought from the Lord a lawful and lovely partnership with one, and who spurn and reject roving lusts as an offense to the nostrils. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #49 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>49. 5. If they can live as one they remain married, but if they cannot they separate, sometimes the man from the wife, sometimes the wife from the man, and sometimes mutually from each other. Separations happen after death because unions made on earth are rarely made from any inner sense of love, but from an outer one that hides what is inside. Our external concept of love has its cause and source in the kind of things that have to do with worldly and bodily love.<p>Wealth and possessions particularly belong to worldly love, while status and honors go with bodily love. And in addition there are the different attractions that entice you, such as beauty and a facade of acting fashionably. Sometimes even lewdness is an attraction.<p>Moreover, marriages are set up within your district, city, home town, or household with only a narrow choice, limited to familiar families and those of similar status. This is why marriages entered in the world are mostly external and not internal at the same time, and yet an internal union - a union of souls - makes marriage itself. That union goes unnoticed until a person sheds his external part and puts on his internal, which happens after death.<p>So, under the circumstances, separations do take place after death, and then new unions with those of likeness and similarity unless it has already happened on earth. This does happen for people who from their youth have loved a legitimate and loving relationship with one, have longed for it and prayed to the Lord, and have kept away from roving desires, holding their noses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #49 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>49. V. THAT IF THEY CAN LIVE TOGETHER THEY REMAIN MARRIED PARTNERS; BUT IF THEY CANNOT THEY SEPARATE, SOMETIMES THE MAN FROM THE WIFE, SOMETIMES THE WIFE FROM THE MAN, AND SOMETIMES EACH FROM THE OTHER. That separations take place after death is because conjunctions made on earth are seldom made from any internal perception of love, being for the most part from an external perception, which holds the internal in hiding. External perception of love derives its cause and origin from such things as pertain to love of the world and the body. To love of the world pertain especially wealth and possessions, and to love of the body, dignities and honors. Besides these, there are also various allurements which entice, such as beauty and a simulated propriety of behavior; sometimes even unchastity. Moreover, marriages are contracted within the district, city or village of one's birth or abode, where there is no choice save one that is restricted and limited to the families of one's acquaintances, and among these to those in the same station of life as oneself. Hence it is that, for the most part, marriages entered into in the world are external and not at the same time internal, when yet it is internal conjunction, or conjunction of souls, which makes marriage. This conjunction, however, is not perceptible until man puts off his external and puts on his internal, which takes place after death. Hence it is that there is then separation and afterwards new conjunctions with those who are similar and homogeneous--unless these had been provided on earth, as is the case with those who from youth have loved, chosen, and asked of the Lord a legitimate and lovely partnership with one, and who spurn and reject wandering lusts as an offence to their nostrils. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #49 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>49. (v) If man and wife can live together, they remain partners; but if they cannot, they part, sometimes the man from the wife, sometimes the wife from the man, and sometimes the two mutually. Separations occur after death because the unions which take place on earth rarely come of an internal perception of love, but of an external one, which conceals the internal. External perception of love has its cause and origin in such things as are of the love of the world and the body. Riches and possessions are especially of the love of the world, and dignities and honors of the love of the body. Besides these there are also various alluring attractions, like beauty and feigned seemliness of manners; sometimes even unchastity attracts; furthermore, alliances are contracted within the district, city or village of one's birth or residence, where only a narrow and limited choice is open in homes one knows, and then with those of a corresponding station. As a result, marriages contracted in the world are for the most part external and not at the same time internal, when nevertheless it is the internal union, which is of the souls, which really constitutes marriage. This deeper conjunction is not perceptible until a man puts off the external and puts on the internal, which is done after death. Hence separations take place then, and new unions are formed with those of a like and homogeneous nature unless, indeed, such unions were provided upon earth, as they are for those who from their youth have loved, desired and petitioned of the Lord a lawful and lovely partnership with one woman, and who spurn and are repelled by wandering lusts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #49 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p> 49. (5) That if they can live together they remain married partners; but if they cannot they separate, sometimes the husband from the wife, sometimes the wife from the husband, and sometimes each from the other. Separations take place after death because the conjunctions formed on earth are seldom formed from any internal perception of love, but from an external perception which hides the internal. An external perception of love has its cause and origin from such things as pertain to the love of the world and of the body. Wealth and large possessions especially are of the love of the world; and dignities and honors are of the love of the body. And besides these there are various seductive allurements; such as beauty, and a simulated propriety of manners, sometimes also unchastity. And moreover, marriages are contracted within the district, city, or village of one's birth or abode, where there is no choice but such as is restricted and limited to the families that are known, and within these limits, to such as are of corresponding station. It is for these reasons that marriages entered into in the world are for the most part external, and not at the same time internal. And yet internal conjunction which is that of souls constitutes marriage itself; but this conjunction is not perceivable until a man puts off the external and puts on the internal, which he does after death. And hence it is that separations then take place, and afterwards new conjunctions with those who are similar and homogeneous, unless these had been provided on earth; as they are in the case of those who from early youth had loved and desired and asked of the Lord a legitimate and lovely companionship with one, and had spurned and detested wandering lusts as an offence to their nostrils. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #49 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>49. V: Quod si possunt una vivere, maneant conjuges, at si non possunt, se separent, quandoque vir ab uxore, quandoque uxor a viro, et quandoque se uterque ab invicem. Quod separationes fiant post mortem, est quia conjunctiones, quae fiunt in terris, raro fiunt ex aliqua interna perceptione amoris, sed ab externa, quae internam abscondit; perceptio Amoris externa causam et originem ducit ex talibus, quae sunt Amoris Mundi et Corporis; Amoris Mundi sunt imprimis opes et possessiones, ac Amoris corporis sunt dignitates et honores; et praeter illas, sunt etiam variae illecebrae quae pelliciunt, ut pulchritudo et simulatus decor morum; quandoque etiam incastitas; ac praeterea contrahuntur Matrimonia intra regionem, civitatem, aut villam nativitatis aut habitationis, ubi nec datur electio nisi stricta et limitata ad domus quae cognoscuntur, et ibi cum correspondentibus sorti suae; inde est, quod Conjugia in Mundo inita utplurimum sint externa, et non simul interna; cum tamen Conjunctio interna, quae est Animarum, facit ipsum conjugium; et illa conjunctio non est perceptibilis prius quam dum homo exuit Externum ac induit Internum, quod fit post mortem: inde nunc est, quod tunc fiant separationes, et postea novae conjunctiones cum similaribus et homogeneis, nisi hae provisae fuerint in terris, quod fit illis qui a Juventute amaverant, optaverant, et a Domino petierant legitimum et amabile consortium cum una, ac spernunt et contrahunt nares ad libidines vagas. </p>
