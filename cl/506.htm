<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第506节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第二十三章  多样化的淫欲</h4><p>506、此处所讨论的多样化淫欲不是指对淫行的性欲，有一章已专门论述了对淫行的性欲。后者通常也是淫乱、滥交，但不会带来多样化的淫欲，除非它过度，并且行淫者数算他占有了多少女人，出于淫欲对此夸口。这种观念就是这种淫欲的起点。不过，只有按着一个系列，才能清楚看出随着它的发展，其性质如何。这个系列如下：<br><br>⑴多样化的淫欲是指彻底放纵行淫的性欲。<br><br>⑵这种淫欲既热爱异性，同时又憎恶异性。<br><br>⑶这种淫欲会彻底摧毁人的婚姻之爱。<br><br>⑷这些人死后的命运是悲惨的，因为他们丢失了生命的至内层。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">向往多样性的淫乱</h4><p>506、在此所讲的不是在婚前放荡性行为一章中所讲的，在此要讲的是以下：</p><p>（1）在此向往多样性的淫乱是指变得无比放荡的情欲。</p><p>（2）这种情欲一方面爱异性，另一方面又污辱异性。</p><p>（3）这种情欲会使婚姻之爱完全丧失。</p><p>（4）这样的人死后将是悲惨的，因为他们失去了生命的最内在的因素。</p><p>具体解释如下：</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #506 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>506. XXIII. THE LUST FOR VARIETY<p>The lust for variety which is discussed here does not mean a lust for fornication, to which a chapter has already been devoted. Although this is usually promiscuous and roving, it still does not impart a lust for variety, except when it becomes excessive and the fornicator counts how many women he has had, and his desire makes him boast of it. It is this notion which is the starting-point of this lust. But what it is like as it develops cannot be clearly seen unless set forth in some order, as follows.<p>(i) The lust for variety means an utterly dissolute lust for immoral behaviour.<p>(ii) This lust is at once love and loathing for the other sex.<p>(iii) This lust utterly annihilates a person's conjugial love.<p>(iv) The fate of these people after death is pitiful, since they lack the inmost level of life.<p>There now follows an explanation of these points. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #506 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>506. THE LUST FOR VARIETY<p>By the lust for variety that we take up here, we do not mean the lust to fornicate which we considered in its own chapter. <sup >1</sup>Even though the latter is usually promiscuous and indiscriminate, still it does not lead to a lust for variety except when it becomes excessive and the fornicator begins to take account of the number and to lustfully boast of it. Attention to this introduces the lust for variety. But what its character is in its progress cannot be clearly perceived unless it is presented in some order, which we will do as follows:<p>1. By a lust for variety we mean a lust to fornicate that has become utterly dissolute.<p>2. This lust involves a love for the opposite sex and at the same time a loathing for it.<p>3. This lust totally annihilates any conjugial love in it.<p>4. The lot of these people after death is a miserable one, since the inmost element of life is missing in them.<p>Explanation of these statements now follows.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="444.htm">444</a>[r]ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #506 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>506. Chapter 23. Lust for Variety<p>The lust for variety dealt with here does not mean the lust for fornication that was treated in its own chapter. Although that lust is apt to be promiscuous and wandering, it still does not lead to a lust for variety except when it goes beyond limits and the fornicator keeps score and eagerly boasts of it. This attitude initiates the present lust. But only a series of statements can show what it is like as it develops. Here is the series:<p>1. Lust for variety means a totally unrestricted lust for illicit sex.<p>2. This lust is a love, and at the same time a loathing, for the other sex.<p>3. This lust totally eliminates the love of marriage in people.<p>4. Their fate after death is miserable, since they lack the innermost quality of life.<p>An explanation of these topics follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #506 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>506. THE LUST OF VARIETIES<p>By the lust of varieties is not meant the lust of fornication, treated of in its own chapter. This latter, although wont to be promiscuous and roaming, does not bring in the lust of varieties except when it passes beyond bounds and the fornicator looks to number and from desire boasts thereof. This idea initiates the lust now treated of. But its nature as it progresses can be perceived distinctly only in a series. This series shall be as follows:<p>I. That by the lust of varieties is meant the utterly dissolute lust of whoredom.<p>II. That this lust is a love for the sex and at the same time a loathing.<p>III. That this lust utterly annihilates conjugial love with them.<p>IV. That their lot after death is a miserable one because they have not the inmost of life.<p>The explanation of the above follows: </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #506 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>506. XXII. THE LUST FOR VARIETY<p>By the lust for variety of which we treat here, we do not mean the lust of fornication, which we considered in a chapter of its own. Although the latter is wont to be promiscuous and roving, still it does not occasion a lust for variety except when it exceeds all measure and the fornicator looks to a number and in his passion boasts of a number; it is this tendency which initiates the lust. But one cannot perceive distinctly what the lust becomes like in its progress, except in some sequence, which shall be this:<p>I. By the lust for variety is meant an utterly dissolute lust of whoredom.<p>II. This lust is at once love and loathing for the sex.<p>III. This lust utterly annihilates marital love in men.<p>IV. Their lot after death is wretched, since they have no inmost life.<p>Explanation of the propositions follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #506 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>506. ON THE LUST OF VARIETIES.<p>By the lust of varieties here treated of is not meant the lust of fornication, which was treated of in its own chapter. This, although wont to be promiscuous and vagrant, yet does not occasion the lust of varieties, except when it exceeds moderation and the fornicator looks to the number and boasts of that from cupidity. This idea initiates this lust, but what it becomes in its progress, cannot be perceived distinctly, unless in some order; which shall be this:<p>(1) That by the lust of varieties is meant the lust of scortation altogether unrestrained.<p>(2) That this lust is love of the sex and at the same time a loathing of it.<p>(3) That this lust altogether annihilates conjugial love with them.<p>(4) That their lot after death is miserable, since the inmost of life is wanting to them.<p>The exposition of these heads follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #506 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>506. De Libidine Varietatum <p>Per Libidinem varietatum, de qua hic agitur, non intelligitur Libido fornicationis, de qua in suo Capite actum est; haec tametsi promiscua et vaga solet esse, usque non infert libidinem varietatum, nisi dum excedit modum, et fornicator spectat numerum, et de illo ex cupidine jactat; haec idea initiat hanc libidinem, sed qualis fit in sua progressione, non potest distincte percipi, nisi in aliqua serie, quae erit haec.<p>I. Quod per Libidinem varietatum intelligatur libido scortationis prorsus dissoluta.<p>II. Quod Libido illa sit amor et simul fastidium pro sexu.<p>III. Quod Libido illa prorsus adnihilet amorem conjugialem apud se.<p>IV. Quod illorum sors post mortem misera sit, quoniam illis vitae intimum non est. Sequitur horum explicatio. </p>
