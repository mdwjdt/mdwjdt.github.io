<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第227节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>227、⒅夫妻既有各种相似之处，又有各种不同之处，无论内在的还是外在的。众所周知，夫妻既有相似之处，也有不同之处；它们若是外在的，就会变得可见；但若是内在的，则除了共同生活一段时间后的夫妻本人，或寻到各种迹象的其他人外，是不可见的。不过，通过列举来知道这些相似之处和不同之处是浪费时间，因为列出并描述它们的种类会占用大量篇幅。从下一章所论述的主题，就是使婚姻之爱变得冷淡的不同之处，可在某种程度上得出有关相似之处的推论和结论。一般来说，相似之处和不同之处是由本土倾向产生的，而本土倾向则因教养、与别人的交往，以及所吸收的错误信念而各不相同。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>227、（18）不同的夫妇有内在和外在的区别。</p><p>人们知道夫妇双方总是有相似和相别之处，我在的区别容易看到，而内在的区别只有在一起生活一段时间后才会显示出来。在此不一一例举，有时候彼此的差异会掩去相类似点而使婚姻冷却下来。</p><p>相同点和不同点总体上讲来自于人的本性，同时它与人的成长，教育和得到的劝诫等有关。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #227 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>227. (xviii) There are a number of likenesses and unlikenesses, both inward and outward, to be found among married couples.<p>It is well known that married couples exhibit points of likeness and unlikeness, which are visible if they are outward, but not if inward, except to the couple themselves after living together for some time; and others may pick up clues. But it is a waste of time to list either kind to enable them to be recognised, because a list and description of the varieties could fill many pages. It is possible to some extent to deduce and reach conclusions about likeness by studying the unlikenesses, which cause conjugial love to cool off, the subject of the next chapter. Likeness and unlikeness generally speaking arise from the variation induced on innate inclinations by upbringing, company and the adoption of false beliefs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #227 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>227. 18. Married partners bring with them various similarities and various dissimilarities, both internal and external. People know that there are similarities between married partners and dissimilarities; also that the outward ones are discernible, whereas the inner ones do not appear except to the partners themselves after they have lived together for some time, and to others through certain indications. It is not worth the effort to enumerate these for a conception of them, however, as one can fill many pages recounting and describing their various types. Some instances of similarity may be inferred and deduced in part from the dissimilarities considered in the next chapter, <sup >1</sup>on whose account conjugial love passes away into coldness.<p>Similarities and dissimilarities arise in general from people's native inclinations, varied by their upbringing, associations, and acquired persuasions.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See "Reasons in Marriage for Cold States, Separations and Divorces," nos. <a href="234.htm">234</a> ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #227 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>227. 18. There are various similarities and various differences between married partners, inner as well as outer. It is well known that there are similarities and differences between married partners, and that the outward ones show; but the inward ones show to the partners only after a time of living together and to others only by telltale signs. There is no point in listing the recognizable similarities and differences, though, because mentioning and describing their diversity could fill many pages. Some of the similarities can be deduced and inferred from the differences, discussed in the next chapter, that make married love cool off.<p>Similarities and differences in general have their source in inborn inclinations, varied by education, associates, and mindsets that have been absorbed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #227 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>227. XVIII. THAT WITH MARRIED PARTNERS THERE ARE VARIOUS SIMILITUDES AND VARIOUS DISSIMILITUDES, BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL. It is well known that among married partners there are similitudes and dissimilitudes, and that those which are external are apparent but not those which are internal, except to the partners themselves after living together for a time, and to others by various indications. But to make the similitudes and dissimilitudes known by enumerating them would be vain, for many pages can be filled with a recital and description of their varieties. Deductions and conclusions with respect to similitudes can be made to some extent from the dissimilitudes treated of in the next chapter, on account of which conjugial love passes off into cold. In general, similitudes and dissimilitudes take their rise from connate inclinations, varied by education, associations with others, and imbibed persuasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #227 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>227. (xviii) There are various internal and external likenesses and unlikenesses in married partners. It is known that there are likenesses and unlikenesses in partners, and that the external appear, but not the internal, except to the partners themselves after a period of living together, and to others by betraying signs. But it is idle to enumerate either of these for the reader's information; it would fill many pages to recount and describe the varieties. What likenesses are, can be deduced and inferred in part from the unlikenesses due to which marital love passes into cold, and of which we speak in the following chapter. Likenesses and unlikenesses as a whole take their rise in native inclinations varied by education, associations and imbibed persuasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #227 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>227. (18) That there are various similitudes and various dissimilitudes with married partners, both internal and external. It is known that there are similitudes between married partners and that there are dissimilitudes, and that the external appear but not the internal, except to the partners themselves after living together for a time, and by indications to others. But to enumerate each so as to recognize them would be vain, for the mention and description of their varieties would fill many pages. Similitudes may in part be deduced and inferred from the dissimilitudes on account of which conjugial love passes off into cold, of which in the following chapter. Similitudes and dissimilitudes in general take their rise from connate inclinations, varied by matters of education, companionships, and imbibed persuasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #227 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>227. XVIII: Quod sint variae similitudines, et variae dissimilitudines, tam internae quam externae, apud conjuges. Notum est, quod inter Conjuges sint similitudines, et quod sint dissimilitudines, et quod externae appareant, non autem internae, nisi post tempora cohabitationis ipsis conjugibus, et per indicia aliis: at enumerare utrasque ad cognitionem, vanum est, quia plures paginae recensione et descriptione varietatum adimpleri possunt: similitudines quoad partem possunt ex dissimilitudinibus, propter quas Amor conjugialis abit in frigus, de quibus in sequente Capite, deduci et concludi. Similitudines et dissimilitudines in genere ducunt ortum ex Inclinationibus connatis, per educationes, consortia et imbutas persuasiones, variatis. </p>
