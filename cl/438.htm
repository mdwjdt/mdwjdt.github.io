<h4 align="center"></h4><p>438、⒀人能随意转向任一气场，不过，转向这一个的程度，就是远离那一个的程度。人如此被造，好叫他能照理性自由地行他所行的，并且好像完全凭他自己。若没有自由和理性这二者，他将不是一个人，而是一个动物。因为他无法接受从天堂流入他的任何事物，并使之成为他自己的，以致永生丝毫无法被铭刻在他身上。而永生若要成为他的，就必须被铭刻在他上面，如同他自己的。没有转向另一侧的同等自由，就没有转向这一侧的自由，正如天平若不能藉着平衡滑向任意一侧，就无法称量一样；因此，人无法出于理性自由地靠近良善，除非他也能出于理性自由地靠近邪恶，因而从右转向左，从左转向右，同样既能转向地狱的气场，就是奸淫的气场，也能转向天堂的气场，就是婚姻的气场。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>438、（13）人可以转向二者之一，但他在转向一者时，就在同一程度上背离了另一者。</p><p>人生来可以自由去做任何事，就好象完全出于他自己一样。没有自由和理性人就和动物没有什么区别。因为那样的话，他就无法接受来自于天国的事物并将其变为自身所有，因此永恒的生命是不可能的。另外，若没有自由去决定选择哪一方向，人也就不能估量任何情况。若人没有自由和理性去选择恶，也就没有自由和理性去选择善。并且去两边转动。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #438 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>438. (xiii) A person can turn towards whichever he pleases, but in so far as he turns towards one, so far does he turn away from the other.<p>Man is so created as to perform his actions in freedom according to reason, and entirely as if of himself. Without these two conditions he would not be a human being, but an animal. For he would not receive any influence coming to himself from heaven, and be able to make it his very own, so that no trace of everlasting life could be imprinted on him. For this must be imprinted on him for him to be saved. <sup >1</sup>Since there is no freedom on one side unless a like degree exists on the other, just as no weighing is possible unless the scales can be held in equilibrium on either side, so [a person cannot be free to approach rationally to good] <sup >2</sup>unless he is also free to approach rationally to evil, thus to turn from right to left or from left to right, and likewise to the sphere of hell, that of adultery, as to the sphere of heaven, that of marriage.<p><a href="../hh/594.htm">Heaven and Hell 594</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #438 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>438. 13. A person can turn himself in the direction of either atmosphere, but in the measure that he turns to one, in the same measure he turns away from the other. Man was created to do what he does in freedom in accordance with reason, and this entirely as though on his own. Without these two faculties a person would not be a human being but an animal; for he would not receive anything flowing into him from heaven and adopt it as his own, and therefore nothing of eternal life could be implanted in him, since this must be implanted in him as his for it to be his. Moreover, because there is no freedom to turn in one direction unless there is as well the same freedom to turn in the other - as it is impossible to weigh anything in a balance unless the scales are able in equilibrium to incline to either side - so man has no freedom in accord with reason to move in the direction of good unless he has the freedom in accord with reason to move in the direction of evil, thus to move from right to left and from left to right - as freely in the direction of the infernal atmosphere, which is one of adultery, as in the direction of the heavenly atmosphere, which is one of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #438 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>438. 13. A person can turn to whichever aura he likes, but insofar as he turns to one, he turns away from the other. A person is created to do what he does in freedom according to reason and totally as if by himself. Without these two things he would not be a person, but an animal, for he would not accept anything flowing into him from heaven and take it to himself as his own, so nothing of eternal life could be etched on him. For it has to be etched on him as his own in order to be his own. And there is no freedom in one direction unless there is the same freedom in the other as well, the same as there is no weighing unless the scales can tilt both ways, so it is the same unless a person has freedom rationally to accept evil too - to turn from right to left and from left to right. Similarly, he must have freedom to turn to the aura of hell, which is the aura of adultery, the same as to the aura of heaven, which is the aura of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #438 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>438. XIII. THAT MAN IS ABLE TO TURN HIMSELF TO WHICHEVER SPHERE HE PLEASES, BUT SO FAR AS HE TURNS TO THE ONE, HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE OTHER. Man was created to do what he does from freedom according to reason and altogether as of himself. Without these two he would be, not a man but a beast, for he would not receive and appropriate to himself as his own anything flowing to him out of heaven. Then nothing of eternal life could be inscribed on him; for if this is to be his, it must be inscribed on him as his own. And since there is no freedom of turning to the one side unless there is a like freedom of turning to the other, just as there can be no weighing unless the scales by virtue of equilibrium can incline to either side, so with man, unless from reason he has freedom to approach evil also, thus to turn from right to left and from left to right--alike to the infernal sphere, which is the sphere of adultery, as to the heavenly sphere, which is that of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #438 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>438. (xiii) Man can turn to either sphere as he wishes, but as far as he turns toward one, he turns away from the other. The human being was created to do what he does from freedom according to reason, or wholly as of himself. Without these two capacities he would not be a human being, but a beast. For he would receive nothing in-flowing to him from heaven and appropriate it to himself as his; thus nothing of eternal life could be inscribed on him. For this must be inscribed on him as his, to become his. But as nothing can be free in one direction, and not in the other, just as there can be no weighing unless the scales in equilibrium can move either way, so man has freedom in reason to incline to evil, thus from right to left or from left to right, thus to the infernal sphere, which is the sphere of adultery, as much as to the heavenly sphere, which is one of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #438 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>438. (13) That man is able to turn himself to whichever sphere he pleases, but that in so far as he turns himself to the one, he turns himself away from the other. Man was created to do what he does from freedom according to reason, and just as if from himself. Without these two he would not be man but a beast; for he would not receive anything in-flowing to him out of heaven and appropriate it to himself as his own, and therefore, nothing of eternal life could be inscribed upon him. For in order to be his own it must be inscribed upon him as his. And because there is no freedom in one direction unless there is the like in the other also, just as there is no weighing, unless the scales by virtue of equilibrium can incline either way, so with man, unless he has freedom to turn also to evil, thus from right to left and from left to right, alike to the infernal sphere which is the sphere of adultery, as to the heavenly sphere which is that of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #438 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>438. XIII: Quod homo se convertere possit ad quam sphaeram libet, sed quod quantum se convertit ad unam, tantum avertat se ab altera. Homo creatus est, ut ex libero secundum rationem, ac prorsus sicut a se, agat quod agit; absque his duobus non foret homo, sed bestia; non enim reciperet aliquid influum e Coelo ad se, ac id sibi appropriaret ut suum, et inde non posset ei aliquid vitae aeternae inscribi; hoc enim erit ei inscriptum ut ejus, ut sit suus; et quia non datur aliquod liberum ad unam partem, nisi etiam simile sit ad alteram, sicut nulla trutinatio nisi lances ex aequilibrio possint utrinque protendi, ita [non datur aliquod liberum homini ex ratione accedere ad bonum] nisi liberum sit homini ex ratione etiam accedere ad malum, sic a dextro ad sinistrum et a sinistro ad dextrum, similiter ad Sphaeram infernalem, quae est sphaera adulterii, sicut ad Sphaeram coelestem quae est conjugii. </p>
