<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第500节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>500、对此，我补充以下记事：<br><br>有一次，我听到灵人界有哄囔之声。数千人聚在一起喊着说：“惩罚他们，惩罚他们！”我走近问道：“发生什么事？”一个远离这一大群人站着的人告诉我说，他们正冲三位牧师发火，因为这三人到处讲道反对奸淫者，声称奸淫者不承认神；天堂向他们关闭，地狱向他们敞开；他们在地狱就是污秽的魔鬼，因为从远处看，他们就像滚在粪堆里的猪；天上的天使都憎恶他们。于是我问：“这三个牧师在哪里？为何因此大喊大叫？”他回答说：“这三个牧师就在这群人中间，有侍卫保护。这群人是由那些认为奸淫不是罪，声称奸淫者和忠于妻子的人一样承认神之人组成的。他们都来自基督教界，天使已经查访他们，以看看有多少人认为奸淫是罪；结果，在一千人当中只找出一百人。”<br><br>他还告诉我，剩下的九百人对奸淫发表了以下看法：“谁不知道奸淫的快乐远远胜过婚姻的快乐？奸淫者永远处在热的状态，因而更机警、忙碌，比那些只与一个女人住在一起的人生活更积极。另一方面，与一个妻子的爱情会日益冷淡，有时甚至冷淡到与她所说的话几乎一句也没有生气，由她陪伴的一个小时没有任何活力可言。与妓女在一起则不然。由于缺乏性活力而与一个妻子死气沉沉的生活因着淫行得以复苏和活跃。这种能复苏和活跃之物难道不比压抑之物更有价值吗？婚姻不就是合法化的淫行吗？谁知道有什么区别？爱情能被强迫吗？然而，与一个妻子的爱情却因一纸婚约和法律而被强迫。与一个妻子的爱情不就是两性情爱吗？这爱如此普遍，以致它甚至存在于鸟类和走兽中间。婚姻之爱不就是两性情爱吗？两性情爱是不受限的，可沉迷于任何女人。世间法律反对奸淫，是因为立法者考虑到这是公众利益；然而，立法者和法官本人有时也犯奸淫，彼此说‘谁是没有罪的，谁就可以扔第一块石头（参看约翰福音8:7）。只有简单人和虔诚人才相信奸淫是罪。聪明人则不然，因为他们和我们一样，用自然的微光看待它们。<br><br>“奸淫不照样能生孩子，和婚姻一样吗？对于履行职责和提供服务，私生子难道不像婚生子女那样适合和有用吗？此外，这样还能给那些不能生育的家庭提供孩子。这难道不是益处，而非害处吗？有几个竞争对手对一个妻子来说有什么伤害？对她的丈夫又有什么伤害？认为这是丈夫的耻辱不过是基于幻想的愚蠢观念。奸淫之所以违反教会的律例，是因为这会赋予神职人员权力。可神学和灵性与纯物质的肉欲快乐有什么相干呢？牧师和修道士不也有这样行的吗？难道他们因此就不能去承认和敬拜神了吗？那为何这三人宣称奸淫者不承认神？我们无法容忍这种亵渎。所以，要让他们受到审判和惩罚。”<br><br>之后，我看见他们叫来法官，请求他们惩罚这三个牧师。但法官说：“这不是我们份内的事，因为这涉及到对神和罪的承认，因而涉及到救赎和诅咒。涉及这些问题的审判必须出自天堂。不过，我们会建议你们如何分辨这三个牧师是不是在讲真理。我们法官知道有三个地方能以独特的方式测试并揭露这类问题。第一个在人人都能找到向天堂敞开之路的地方；当他们到达天堂时，自己就能觉察出他们在承认神方面的性质。第二个在他们能找到另一条向天堂敞开之路的地方；不过，除了有天堂在里面的人外，没有人能踏上这条路。第三个在有通往地狱之路的地方；那些热爱地狱之物的人会自动踏上这条路，因为他们被自己的快乐牵引。我们法官会把要求我们审判涉及天堂和地狱案件的所有人送到这些地方。”<br><br>听到这话，众人说：“我们往这些地方去吧。”当他们去往有一条向所有人敞开的天堂之路所在的第一个地方时，天突然间变得漆黑一片。于是，其中一些人点起火把，拿着火把引路。陪同的法官告诉他们说：“凡去往第一个地方的人都会遇到这种情况；不过，随着他们接近，他们的火把会逐渐变得暗淡；当他们到达时，这火把就会被天上所流入的光熄灭。这表明他们到了。这是因为天堂先是向他们关闭，然后再敞开。”果然，他们一到这个地方，火把就自动熄灭了，他们看见一条倾斜而上朝向天堂的路；那些冲牧师发火的人便踏上这条路，有意奸淫者领路，后面跟着确定奸淫者。他们上去的时候，第一组人喊道：“跟着我们！”后面的人则叫嚷：“快点！”催促他们前行。<br><br>过了一会儿，当所有人都在天堂社群中时，只见一道鸿沟出现在他们和天使之间；从鸿沟上面流入他们眼睛的天堂之光打开了其心智的内层，因而使他们说出自己内心的想法。然后，天使问他们是否承认存在一位神。第一组，就是出于意愿意图的奸淫者回答说：“什么是神？”他们彼此相视说：“你们当中有谁见过祂？”第二组，就是出于理解力确认的奸淫者说：“一切事物不都来自大自然吗？除了太阳外，还有什么在自然之上？”这时，天使对他们说：“离开我们吧。现在你们亲自觉察出你们没有对神的承认。当你们下去时，你们心智的内层会被关闭，外层则被打开；然后你们就能违背你们的内层说话，声称有一位神。相信我们，一旦人成为实际奸淫者，天堂就向他关闭；天堂一关闭，神就不被承认。我们可以告诉你们原因：奸淫是地狱一切污秽的源头；在天堂，这污秽就像街上的烂泥一样臭不可闻。”听到这话，他们转身沿着三条路下来了。他们在下面的时候，第一组和第二组进行了讨论，说：“这三个牧师在那个地方赢了。可我们知道，我们也能像他们那样谈论神；当我们说神存在时，不就是在承认神吗？天使一直在谈论的心智内层和外层都是杜撰出来的。不过，还是让我们前往法官们所指的第二个地方去吧，那里有一条向那些有天堂在里面的人，因而那些将进入天堂的人敞开的路。”<br><br>当他们接近那天堂时，有声音从那里传来：“把门关上！这附近有奸淫者。”大门突然关上了，卫兵们手拿棍子把他们赶走了，但释放了那三个被推搡的牧师，并把他们带进天堂。就在大门向牧师敞开、放他们进去的那一刻，婚姻的快乐就猛烈抨击这些叛逆者；这快乐因是贞洁和纯净的，故几乎使他们窒息。他们唯恐因窒息而昏厥，急忙来到第三个地方，法官曾说此处有一条通往地狱之路。从那地方散发出奸淫的快乐，这快乐使有意奸淫者和确定奸淫者们活跃起来，以致他们几乎一路跳着舞下来，在那里像猪一样在污秽中打滚。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>500、在此补充以下陈述；</p><p>一次在精神世界中我听到数万个精灵在喊：“惩罚他，惩罚他！”</p><p>我走近了问：“怎么了”？</p><p>他们说，他们正处于愤怒中，因为有三个牧师正在到处传教说通奸者不承认神，天堂对于他们来说是关闭的，而地狱是开放着的。在地狱中，他们将会象猪一样生活在粪便之中。</p><p>我问牧师们在哪里，为什么人们有如此的反响。</p><p>他们说牧师们就在他们中间，由保镖保护着。围观的人中有通奸者，他们认为通奸者与那些忠于妻子的人一样也是承认神的。通奸是无罪的。他们都来自于基督教界，当天使去调查有多少人认为通奸是罪恶的时，一千人中有一百人那样认为。</p><p>他们又对我说剩下的九百人对通奸做了以下评论：</p><p>“有谁不知道通奸之乐远远超过了婚姻之乐呢？通奸者拥有比只与一个女人生活的人更多的活力。而与一个配偶的爱会变得冷却，甚至最后不与妻子说话。而与放荡女人则不同。与一个妻子的生活会变冷是因为性能力会丧失，而它能在淫爱之中得到更新。这岂不好吗？</p><p>“婚姻不就是种法律允许了的通奸吗？有什么区别呢？爱能够被强迫吗？而与一个妻子生活不就是被法律所强迫吗？与一个配偶间的爱不就是感觉上的爱了吗？感受上的爱普遍存在，它存在于鸟和兽身上。婚姻之爱不就是对异性的爱吗？而对异性的爱存在于与每个女人之间时，它就是自由的了。</p><p>“民法反对通奸，因为立法者认为这是为了公众好。但是有时立法者也会犯通奸罪，他们会对自己说：“让无罪的人首先投石头（见《约翰福音》8；7）。只有头脑简单的人和信教的人才会认为通奸是有罪的，象我们这样有才华的人是不同的。”</p><p>“通奸中也不会产生与婚姻中一样的孩子吗？私生子不也象婚姻中的孩子一样能从事各种工作吗？另外，那些没有孩子的家庭还会因此得到孩子，这岂不是有益的吗？”</p><p>“妻子有一些情人有什么害处”对丈夫又有什么害处呢？对丈夫的名声损坏只是一种想象而已。”</p><p>说通奸是违法的只是为了保护权力。神学与精神性与躯体及肉体之乐有什么关系？神职人员不也有通奸的吗？他们会因此而不能承认神吗？那么为什么这三个牧师在此宣称通奸者就是不承认神。我们不能空忍这种说法。所以要惩罚他们。”</p><p>之后他们请法官处罚三个牧师。</p><p>但是法官说：“这与我们无关，因为承不承认神及其罪恶与否是与天国相关的，我们不能就此做出判断。</p><p>“但是我们将告诉你们如何判断这三个牧师是否在说真话。我们只知道三个地点。一是天国之路对每个人都是敞开的，当人们到达天国后，人会自己感受到在关于神的方面自己的性质是如何的。第二是天国之路是敞开的，但只有心中有天国的人才能进去。第三是有通向地狱的路，喜欢地狱的人按其自己的情况而进入其中，因为他们受他们的快乐的吸引。</p><p>听到这儿，围观的人说：“让我们到那三个地方去吧。”</p><p>于是他们来到第一个地方。在那里天国之路对任何人都是敞开的。他们走着走着，突然处于黑暗中了。于是有人点燃了火把。</p><p>陪同他们的法官说：“到第一个地方来的人都会遇到这种情况。但当他们更近了的时候，火把变暗了，到地方后，火把熄灭了，因为有天国之光的流入——他们到了的标志。这种现象的原因是，天国对他们首先是关闭的然后打开了。”</p><p>于是他们到了那个地方。火把渐渐灭了。他们看到一条通向天国的倾斜的路。对牧师们感到愤怒的人首先进去了。其中有有目的的通奸者，其后是故意通奸者。他们边走边喊：“跟着我们，快点。”</p><p>一会儿过来后，他们处于天国的社区中了。在他们和天使之间出现了一道海峡。天国之光流向他们中，将他们的头脑开启了。于是他们被迫出说了他们的内在想法。此时天使们问他们是否承认神。</p><p>第一伙人，即那些有目的的通奸者说道：“神是什么？相互望着对方说，你们有见过神吗？”</p><p>第二伙是那些认为通奸是被允许的人。他们说：“不是一切都与自然有关吗？除了太阳还有什么处于自然之上呢？”</p><p>此时天使说：“从我们这儿走开吧，你们现在可以亲眼看到你们并不认识神。当你下降时，你们的思想的内在将被关闭。外在将被打开。那时你就可以说与自己思想相反的话了。确信这点，当人成为通奸者时，天国就对他关闭了，他也就不承认神了，听听原因吧：通奸会产生地狱中一切的污秽，这在天国会放臭气。”</p><p>听到这，人们转身分三路降了下来。第一伙第二伙人说牧师赢了，但我们知道了我们也能和他们一样讲到神。当我们说神存在时，我们不是承认他吗？天使们所说的我们思想的内在和外在都是假话。</p><p>“我们现在去法官们说的第二个地方去吧。在那有那条对那些心中有天国的人敞开的路。”</p><p>当他们朝那儿走的时候，天国中传来喊声：“关上门！他们是通奸者。”</p><p>门关上了，门卫将人们赶走了。他们将三个牧师留到了他们的天空中，开门的时候所流出的婚姻之爱的快乐几乎使那些人窒息。</p><p>他们又匆匆来到法官所说的第三地方。来自于其中的通奸之乐使他们感到高兴并溶入到其中。于是他们象猪一样沉浸到污秽之中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #500 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>500. At this point I shall add this account of an experience.<p>I once heard a great hullabaloo in the world of spirits. There were some thousands gathered together shouting 'Punish them, punish them!' I went close and asked, 'What is going on here?' One who was standing apart from the huge crowd told me that they were furiously angry with three priests, who were going about everywhere preaching against adulterers, saying that adulterers did not acknowledge God, that heaven was closed to them and hell open; and that in hell they are filthy devils, because seen from a distance there they look like pigs wallowing in dung, and the angels of heaven loathe them.<p>'Where,' I asked, 'are these priests, and why is there all this shouting about it?' He replied that the three priests were in the middle of the crowd, protected by attendants. The crowd was composed of people who believe adultery not to be a sin, and say that adulterers acknowledge God just as do those who keep to their wives. They are all from the Christian world. They were visited by angels to see how many there were who believed adultery to be a sin, and out of a thousand they found less than a hundred.</p><p>[2] The remaining nine hundred, he told me, expressed the following views on adultery. 'Anyone knows that the pleasure of adultery is far superior to that of marriage. Adulterers are perpetually on heat and so more alert and busy, and lead a more active life than those who live with only one woman. On the other hand, love with a wife grows cool, sometimes to such an extent that eventually hardly a word of conversation <sup >1</sup>or [an hour] in her company has any life in it. It is different with prostitutes; the deadening of life with a wife, due to a failure of potency, is revived and quickened by affairs. Is not something that revives and quickens more valuable than something that deadens? What is marriage but a lawful affair? Can anyone tell the difference? Surely love cannot be compelled - yet a man is compelled to love his wife by a marriage compact and the law. Love with a wife is surely sexual love, something so universal that it is shared by birds and animals. What is conjugial love but sexual love? And sexual love is unrestricted with every woman. The reason there are civil laws against adultery is that the legislators believed that this is in the public interest; yet the legislators and the judges themselves sometimes behave immorally, and say to one another, 'Let him who is without sin throw the first stone.' Only simple and pious people believe adultery to be a sin; intelligent people do not, for they, like us, use the poor light of nature to examine this subject.</p><p>[3] 'Does not adultery lead to the birth of children, just as marriage does? Are not illegitimate children as handy and as capable of performing duties and services as legitimate ones? Moreover this provides families, where otherwise there would be barrenness; is this not an advantage rather than a loss? What harm does it do a wife to have a number of rivals? And how does it harm a husband? The view that it is a disgrace to the husband is a frivolous one based on imagination. The reason why adultery is contrary to the laws and statutes of the church is that it gives the clergy power. But what have theology and spirituality to do with purely bodily and fleshly delights? Are there not priests and monks who behave like this? Surely they are not thereby prevented from acknowledging and worshipping God? So why are these three preaching that adulterers do not acknowledge God? We will not put up with such blasphemy. So let them be tried and punished.'</p><p>[4] After this I saw them summon judges, whom they requested to sentence them. But the judges said, 'This is no part of our duties, for it concerns the acknowledgment of God and sinning, and thus salvation and damnation. Judgment on these matters comes from heaven; but we will give you advice on how you can know whether these three priests were telling the truth. There are three places which we judges know, where such matters are especially put to the test and revealed. One is where everyone finds a road open to heaven; but when they reach heaven they can perceive for themselves what they are like as regards the acknowledgment of God. The second place is where they find another road open to heaven, but no one can take that road unless he has heaven within him. The third place is where there is a road to hell, and those who love what is hellish take that road of their own accord, because they find it pleasant. We judges send all who demand a judgment from us about heaven and hell to those places.'</p><p>[5] On hearing this the gathering declared, 'Let us go to those places.' When they went to the first, where all find a road open to heaven, it suddenly became pitch dark; so some of them lit torches and led the way with them. The judges accompanying them said, 'This happens to all who approach the first place, and as they come near their torches burn less brightly, and when they reach it the torches are put out by the light flowing in from heaven. This is a sign that they have arrived. It is because heaven is at first shut to them, and then later it is opened.'<p>So they reached this point, and when their torches had gone out of their own accord, they saw a slanting road leading up to heaven. Those who were furiously angry with the priests took this road. Those who were deliberate adulterers led the way, and they were followed by the confirmed adulterers. As they went up the first group shouted, 'Follow us!' and those behind them shouted 'Hurry up!' and urged them on.</p><p>[6] After a short while, when they were all inside the heavenly community, a gap appeared between them and the angels; and the light of heaven flowing from above the gap into their eyes opened up the inner levels of their minds, thus making them express what they thought inwardly. Then they were questioned by the angels whether they acknowledged the existence of God.<p>The first group, the adulterers by a deliberate act of the will, replied, 'What is God?,' and looking at one another they said, 'Which of you has seen Him?' The second group, the adulterers confirmed as such by the intellect, said, 'Is not everything a proof of nature? What stands above nature but the sun?' Then the angels said to them, 'Begone from us. Now you can perceive that you have no acknowledgment of God. When you go down the inner levels of your minds will be closed, and the outer ones opened; and then you will be able to speak contrary to your inner thoughts and say that God exists. Believe us, as soon as a person becomes an adulterer in fact, heaven is closed to him; and when it is closed, there is no acknowledgment of God. We can tell you the reason: adultery is the source of all the uncleanness of hell, and in heaven this stinks like the foul mud of the streets.'<p>On hearing this they turned about and came down by three ways. When they were down below, the first and second groups held a discussion and said, 'The priests won there. But we know that we can talk about God just as well as they can; and when we say that He exists, are we not acknowledging Him? The inner and outer levels of the mind the angels kept talking about are a fiction. But let us go off to the second place the judges pointed out, where there is a road open to heaven for those who have heaven within them, and so for those who are to come into heaven.'</p><p>[7] As they approached a voice came out from that heaven, 'Shut the gates! There are adulterers at hand.' The gates were suddenly shut, and guards with sticks in their hands drove them away. But they released from custody the three priests who had been jostled, and brought them into heaven. The moment the gate was opened to admit the priests, the joy of marriage blasted the rebels, and this, being chaste and pure, almost choked them.<p>So fearing they would faint through choking they made haste to the third place, from which the judges said the road led to hell. From there emanated the joy of adultery, and this so enlivened the deliberate and confirmed adulterers that they almost danced all the way down, and there they wallowed in filth like pigs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #500 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>500. To this I will append the following narrative account:<p>I once heard in the world of spirits a great tumult. Thousands of spirits had gathered and were crying out, "Punish them! Punish them!"<p>I drew nearer and asked, "What is going on?"<p>Leaving that great throng, one of them said to me that they were in a white-hot rage at three priests who were going about and everywhere preaching against adulterers, saying that adulterers lack any acknowledgment of God, and that heaven was closed to them and hell opened. Also that in hell they are unclean devils, because they appear at a distance there like pigs rolling around in piles of excrement, and that the angels in heaven abhor them.<p>I inquired where those priests were and why there was such an outcry on that account.<p>He replied that the three priests were in their midst, surrounded by bodyguards, and that the gathering consisted of people who believe that adulteries are not sins and who maintain that adulterers have an acknowledgment of God just as much as those who are faithful to their wives. "They are all from the Christian world," he said, "and when they were once visited by angels to see how many among them believed that adulteries were sins, not a hundred in a thousand were found who did."<p>Moreover he told me that the remaining nine hundred speak in regard to adulteries as follows:</p><p>[2] "Who does not know that the delight in adultery far surpasses the delight of marriage? That adulterers experience a perpetual state of heat and so possess a more vigorous, energetic and active life than those who live with just one woman? And that, conversely, love with one's married partner grows cold, and this sometimes to such a degree that at last scarcely a word of conversation and companionship with her has any vitality? It is different with loose women. The gradual deadening of life with a wife owing to a failure of ability is refreshed and invigorated by licentious affairs. Is not something that refreshes and invigorates better than something that deadens?<p>"What is marriage but legalized licentiousness? Who knows any difference between them? Can love be compelled? Yet love with a wife is compelled by covenant and laws. Is love with a partner not a sexual love? Yet this is so universal that it exists also in birds and animals. What is conjugial love but a love for the opposite sex? Yet love for the opposite sex is set free when enjoyed with every woman.<p>"There are civil laws against adultery because legislators have believed that it accorded with the public good, and yet the legislators themselves and judges sometimes commit adultery, and then say to each other, 'Let him that is without sin cast the first stone.' <sup >1</sup>Only the simple and religious believe that adulteries are sins. Not so the intelligent, who, like us, view them in the light of nature.</p><p>[3] "Are children not born of adulteries in the same way as in marriages? Are illegitimate offspring not just as fit and serviceable for offices and ministries as legitimate ones? And besides, children are thus provided for families that would be otherwise childless. Is this not beneficial rather than harmful?<p>"What harm does it do a wife if she admits a number of rivals? And what harm does it do her husband? The idea that the husband is disgraced is a frivolous opinion springing from the imagination.<p>"The decree that adultery is contrary to the laws and statutes of the church comes from the ecclesiastical order in order to gain power. But what does theology and spirituality have to do with merely physical and fleshly delight? Are there not clergymen and monks who are adulterers? Are they unable on that account to acknowledge and worship God? Why then do these three priests preach that adulterers are without any acknowledgment of God? We will not tolerate such blasphemies. Therefore let them be judged and punished."</p><p>[4] After that I saw them summon judges, and they asked the judges to impose penalties on the priests.<p>But the judges said, "This does not fall within our province, for it has to do with acknowledgment of God and sin and thus with salvation and damnation. Judgment with respect to these has to come from heaven.<p>"However, we will advise you as to how you can ascertain whether these three priests have been preaching the truth. There are three places known to us judges where matters of this sort are explored and revealed in a singular manner. One is a place in which a path to heaven lies open to all, but where, when they arrive in heaven, they themselves perceive what their character is in respect to their acknowledgment of God. The second is a place where a path lies open to heaven also, but which no one can enter unless he has heaven in him. And the third is a place where there is a path leading to hell, which those who love hellish things enter of their own accord, because they are drawn by their delight.<p>"We judges send to those places all who demand judgment from us in cases dealing with heaven and hell."</p><p>[5] Upon hearing this, the people gathered said, "Let us go to those places."<p>So they went to the first, where a path to heaven lies open to all; and as they were going, suddenly they were enveloped in darkness, so that some of them lighted torches and held them before them.<p>The judges, who had accompanied them, said, "This happens to all who go to the first place, but as they draw near, the blaze of their torches becomes fainter, and on their reaching the place itself is extinguished, because of the light of heaven flowing in - a sign that they have arrived. The reason for this phenomenon is that heaven is first closed to them and then opened."<p>So they came to that place, and as the torches went out of themselves, they saw a sloping path leading upward to heaven. The people who were in a white-hot rage at the priests entered it. Among the first were those who were purposeful adulterers, behind them those who were deliberate adulterers. And as they ascended the first began to cry out, "Follow us," and those behind cried, "Hurry," so as to urge them on.</p><p>[6] A short time later, after they were all inside a heavenly society, a gulf appeared between them and the angels, and the light of heaven flowing over the gulf into their eyes opened the interior elements of their minds, so that they were compelled to speak as they inwardly thought. Whereupon the angels then inquired of them whether they acknowledged the existence of God.<p>The first group, those who were adulterers from a purpose of the will, replied, "What is God?" And looking at each other they said, "Have any of you seen Him?"<p>The second group, those who were adulterers from a persuasion of the intellect, said, "Is not everything attributable to nature? What exists above it but the sun?"<p>At that the angels then said to them, "Depart from us. You yourselves now see that you lack any acknowledgment of God. When you descend, the interior elements of your minds will be closed and the outer ones opened, and after that you can speak contrary to your inner thoughts and say that God exists. Be certain of this, that as soon as a person becomes an actual adulterer, heaven is closed to him, and when it is closed, he does not acknowledge God. Hear the reason: From adulteries springs all the uncleanness of hell, and this stinks in heaven like the putrid filth of the streets <sup >2</sup>."<p>Hearing this, the people turned and descended by three paths. And when they were below, the first and second groups conferred with each other and said, "The priests won there; but we know that we can speak of God just as well as they, and when we say that He exists, do we not acknowledge Him? These inner and outer elements of our minds that the angels told us about are fictions.<p>"But let us go to the second place described by the judges, where a path lies open to heaven for those who have heaven in them, thus for those who are destined for heaven."</p><p>[7] So they went, and as they approached, from that heaven went out the cry, "Close the gates! There are adulterers in the vicinity!"<p>Suddenly then the gates were closed, and guards with staffs in their hands drove them away. And they took from them the three priests in their keeping, against whom they had raised such a tumult, and conducted them into their heaven. The moment the gate was opened for the priests, moreover, immediately there wafted over the insurgents the delight of marriage, which because of its chastity and purity almost suffocated them.<p>For fear of fainting from loss of breath, therefore, they hastened to the third place that the judges had told them of, where they had said there was a path leading to hell; and wafting out from there then was the delight of adultery, which so revived those who were purposeful and deliberate adulterers that they almost danced as they descended; and on descending they immersed themselves like pigs there in unclean dirt and filth.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Quoting <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_7.htm">John 8:7</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Which in Swedenborg's day included garbage thrown out of windows and the droppings of horses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #500 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>500. I add the following story to these remarks.<p>Once in the world of spirits I heard a big uproar. Thousands were gathered together shouting, "They ought to be punished!<p>They ought to be punished!"<p>I went closer and asked, "What's this?"<p>Someone separate from the huge crowd said to me, "They're in a burning rage against three ministers going around denouncing adulterers everywhere, saying that adulterers have no knowledge of God and that to them heaven is closed and hell open. And that in hell adulterers are filthy devils, because from a distance there they look like pigs rolling in manure. And the angels of heaven detest them."<p>"Where are those ministers," I asked, "and why such an outcry over that?"<p>He answered, "The three ministers are among them, guarded by bodyguards, and it's a crowd who think adulteries aren't sins and say that adulterers acknowledge God as much as those who stick with their wives. They're all from the Christian world, and some angels visited to see how many there believed adulteries are sins. They didn't find a hundred in a thousand.<p>"And," he told me, "here's what the other nine hundred say about adulteries. 'Who doesn't know that the joy of adultery overtops the joy of marriage? That adulterers are always hot, so they have a more lively, industrious, and active life than those who live with only one woman? And that love with a married partner cools, on the other hand, sometimes to the point where at last hardly one word of speech and companionship survives? It's different with prostitutes. The deadliness of life with a wife, coming from lack of potency, is remade and brought back to life by illicit sex. Isn't something that remakes and revives worth more than something that deadens? What's marriage but licensed sexual love?<p>Who knows the difference? Can love be forced? And yet love with a wife is forced by the vows and laws. Isn't love with a spouse sexual love? And so common that the birds and animals have it? What's married love but sexual love? And sexual love is free with every woman.<p>"'The civil laws are against adulteries because the lawmakers thought it would be for the public good, and yet the lawmakers themselves, and the judges, sometimes commit adultery and say to each other, "He who is without sin can cast the first stone."<p>Only simpleminded and religious people think adulteries are sins, not intelligent people who, like us, look at them in natural light.<p>Aren't children born of adulteries the same as children of marriages?<p>Aren't illegitimates just as fit and useful for duty and employment as legitimates? Besides, it provides families for people who are otherwise without children. Isn't this a benefit and not an injury? What does it hurt a wife to accept several suitors? And what does it hurt the man? It's a worthless and imaginary opinion that this shames a man. That adultery is against the laws and statutes of the church is due to the ecclesiastical order, on account of power. But what do theological and spiritual things have to do with a purely physical and fleshly pleasure? There are priests and monks like that, aren't there? Does it keep them from accepting and worshiping God?<p>"'50 why do those three preach that adulterers don't accept God? We won't allow such blasphemies. They'll have to be judged and punished.'"<p>Then I saw them call judges. They asked them to sentence the three to punishment.<p>But the judges said, "That is not a job for us, since it has to do with accepting God and with sin, so it's a matter of salvation and damnation. These things are judged from heaven. But we'll advise you how you can find out if the three ministers have preached true things. We judges know of three places where things like this are investigated and disclosed in a remarkable way. In one place a road to heaven is visible to everyone, but when they enter heaven they find out what they themselves are like as far as accepting God goes. There's a second place where a road to heaven is also visible, but no one can get on the road except those who have heaven in themselves. And there's a third place where there's a road to hell, and people who love hellish things get on that road willingly because it makes them happy. We judges send to those places everyone that wants us to pass judgment about heaven and hell."<p>When they heard this the crowd said, "Let's go to those places."<p>On the way to the first place, where a road to heaven is visible to everyone, it suddenly became dark. So some of them lit torches and carried them in front. The judges with them said, "This happens to everyone on the way to the first place, but the flames of the little torches get dimmer as they come close, and at the place they go out, due to the light of heaven falling on it. This is a sign that they're there. The reason is that heaven is closed to them at first and opened later."<p>They arrived at the place, and when the torches went out by themselves, they saw a road stretching up into the sky at an angle.<p>The ones who were in a burning rage against the ministers got on the road - the ones who were purposeful adulterers among the first, and after them the confirmed adulterers. On the way up, the ones in front shouted, "Come on!" and the ones following shouted, "Hurry up!" and pushed forward.<p>In a little while, when they were all inside a community of heaven, a chasm appeared between them and the angels, and the light of heaven, above the chasm, exposed the inner reaches of their minds by flowing into their eyes, so they had to say exactly what they were thinking inside. And then angels questioned them, whether they acknowledged that God exists.<p>The first, who were adulterers by willful purpose, answered, "What is God?" They looked around at each other and said, "Has any of you seen Him?"<p>The second group, who were intellectually confirmed adulterers, said, "Everything is part of nature, isn't it? What's above nature, besides the sun?"<p>And the angels said to them, "Get away from us. Now you yourselves can tell that you have no acknowledgement of God.<p>When you go back down, the inner parts of your minds will close, and the outer parts will open, and then you'll be able to speak against the things inside and say that God exists. Believe it - as soon as a person becomes an actual adulterer heaven is closed to him. When heaven is closed, God is not acknowledged.<p>Listen to the reason why. All the filth of hell comes from adulteries, and in heaven this stinks like putrid filth in the streets."<p>When they heard this they turned and went down along three roads. And when they were down below, the first and second groups, talking among themselves, said, "The ministers got the better of us there, but we know we can talk about God as well as they can. And when we say that He exists, don't we acknowledge Him? The inner and outer parts of your mind that the angels told about are something they dreamed up. But let's go to the second place the judges described, where a road to heaven is open to those who have heaven in them - which is those who are about to go to heaven."<p>When they came near there a voice went out from heaven, "Shut the gates! There are adulterers around here!" The gates were closed at once, and guards with nightsticks in their hands drove them away.<p>The bodyguards released from custody the three ministers that the disturbance was against, and they brought them into heaven. And as soon as the gates were opened for the ministers the joy of marriage breathed out of heaven on the rebels - which almost took their breath away, because it was chaste and pure.<p>So, for fear of passing out from suffocation, they hurried to the third place, where the judges said the road to hell started. And then the joy of adultery breathed from it, which revived the purposeful adulterers and the confirmed adulterers so much that they went down fairly dancing and plunged into the filth there like pigs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #500 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>500. To the above I will add the following Memorable Relation:<p>Once, in the world of spirits, I heard a great tumult. It was from thousands of men gathered together and crying out, "Punish them! Punish them!" Going nearer, I asked, "What is the matter?" and one who stood apart from that great gathering told me they were in the burning heat of anger against three priests who were going around everywhere and preaching against adulterers, saying, that adulterers have no acknowledgment of God; that heaven is closed to them and hell opened; that in hell they are unclean devils because at a distance they appear like swine wallowing in dung; and that the angels of heaven abominate them.<p>To my question, "Where are those priests? and why such shouting on that account?" he replied: "Those three priests are in their midst guarded by attendants; and the gathering consists of men who believe adulteries are not sins, and declare that adulterers have an acknowledgment of God equally as do those who cleave to their wives. They are all from the Christian world, and a visitation has been made by angels to see how many there were who believed adulteries to be sins, and out of a thousand, there were not found a hundred."</p><p>[2] He further told me: "The nine hundred speak about adulteries in this way: "Who does not know that the delight of adultery is pre-eminent above the delight of marriage? that adulterers are in perpetual heat and thence in alacrity, industry, and an active life above those who live with one woman only? and on the other hand, that with a married partner, love grows cold, and sometimes so cold that at last there is scarcely a single word of speech with her or [any sort] of companionship that is living? Not so with harlots. By whoredoms the deadness of life with a wife arising from a lack of potency is restored and vivified. Is not that which restores and vivifies of more value than that which deadens? What is marriage but legalized whoredom? who knows of any distinction? Can love be forced? Yet love with a wife is forced by covenant and the laws. Is not love with a married partner love of the sex? and so universal is this love that it exists even with birds and beasts. What is conjugial love but love of the sex? and love of the sex is free when [indulged in] with any woman whatsoever. The civil laws are against adulteries because those who laid down the law thought it was for the public good; yet sometimes they themselves as well as the judges commit adultery and say among themselves, He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone. Only the simple and the religious believe adulteries to be sins. Not so the intelligent. They, like us, view them from the lumen of nature.</p><p>[3] Are not offspring born from adulteries equally as from marriages? Are not bastards just as fit and useful for offices and employments as legitimate children? Moreover, in this way provision is made for families otherwise unfruitful. Is not this a benefit and not an injury? What harm is it to a wife if she admits several rivals? and what harm to her man? As to its being a dishonor to the man, that is a frivolous notion from fantasy; and as to adultery being contrary to the laws and statutes of the Church, this comes from the ecclesiastical order, for the sake of power. But what has the theological and spiritual to do with a delight that is merely corporeal and carnal? Are there not elders and monks who are adulterers? Are they therefore unable to acknowledge and worship God? Why then do these three men preach that adulterers have no acknowledgment of God? We cannot tolerate such blasphemies. Let them therefore be judged and punished.""</p><p>[4] After this I saw that they called judges and asked them to sentence the priests to punishment. But the judges said: "This matter does not belong to our province for it concerns the acknowledgment of God and sin and thus salvation and damnation. Judgment concerning these must come from heaven. We will, however, give you counsel as to how you can learn whether these three priests have been preaching truths. There are three places of which we judges know, where such matters are investigated and laid open in a singular manner. ONE is a place where a way to heaven is open to all men; but when they come into heaven, they themselves perceive what their nature is in respect to the acknowledgment of God. The SECOND is a place where also a way opens to heaven, but none can enter that way save he who has heaven within him. The THIRD is a place where a way is open to hell, and those who love infernal things enter upon that way of their own accord, because from delight. We judges remand to those places all who demand of us judgement respecting heaven and hell."</p><p>[5] Hearing this, the assembled men said, "Let us go to those places." And as they were going to the first place, where a way into heaven is open to all, it suddenly became dark. Therefore some of them lighted torches and with these they led the way. The accompanying judges told them: "This happens to all who go to the first place; but as they draw near, the fire of the torches grows dim and, in the place itself, it is extinguished by reason of the inflowing light of heaven. This is a sign that they are there. The reason is because heaven is first closed to them and afterwards opened."<p>Arrived at the place, and the torches having gone out of themselves, they saw a way tending obliquely upwards into heaven, and those who were in the burning heat of anger against the priests entered upon it. The first among them were those who were adulterers from purpose, after whom came those who were adulterers from confirmation. While they were ascending, those in front cried out, "Follow us"' and the followers cried, "Make haste;" and they pressed on.</p><p>[6] After a short time, when all were within the heavenly society, then, between them and the angels was seen a gulf. Over the gulf was the light of heaven, and this light, flowing into their eyes, opened the interior regions of their mind from which they were constrained to speak as they were inwardly thinking. They were then questioned by the angels as to whether they acknowledged that there is a God.<p>The first, who were adulterers from purpose of the will, answered, "What is God?" And they looked at each other and said, "Who among you has seen Him?" The second, who were adulterers from confirmation by the understanding, said, "Are not all things from nature? what is there above her but the sun?"<p>The angels then said to them: "Depart from us. Now you yourselves perceive that you have no acknowledgment of God. When you descend, the interiors of your mind will be closed and the exteriors opened, and then you can speak contrary to your interiors and say that there is a God. Be sure of this, that as soon as a man becomes an adulterer actually, heaven is closed to him, and when this is closed, God is not acknowledged. Listen to the reason: From adulteries comes all the uncleanness of hell, and this stinks in heaven like the stinking mire of the streets."<p>Hearing this, they turned around and descended by three ways. When they were below, the first and second groups conversing. among themselves said: "In that place the priests conquered; but we know that we can speak of God just as well as they can, and when we say that He is, do we not acknowledge Him? The interiors and exteriors of the mind of which the angels spoke are inventions. But let us go to the second place designated by the judges, where a way to heaven lies open to those who have heaven within them, that is, to those who are to go to heaven."</p><p>[7] When they drew near that heaven, a voice went forth therefrom, "Shut the gates; there are adulterers in the neighborhood." And suddenly the gates were closed and guards with staves in their hands drove them away, and releasing from custody the three priests against whom the tumult had been raised, they introduced them into heaven. Moreover, no sooner were the gates opened for the priests, when out of heaven there breathed upon the rebels the delight of marriage, and being chaste and pure, it almost took away their breath. Therefore, for fear of fainting from suffocation, they hurried away to the third place of which the judges had said that there was a way from there to hell. From that place there then breathed forth the delight of adultery, and those who were adulterers from purpose, and those who were such from confirmation, were so vivified thereby that they went down as though dancing and, like swine, immersed themselves in the unclean things there. </p>

Thousands had gathered and were shouting. "Punish them!

I asked. "And why is there such an outcry on that account?"<p>"The three priests," he replied, "are in the midst of them under guard. It is an assemblage of those who believe adulteries are not sins, and who assert that the acknowledgment of God is to be found with adulterers as it is with those who are faithful to their wives. They all come from the Christian world.

That adulterers are in perpetual heat, and thence are more alert, industrious, and active in life than those who live with only one woman?

What is marriage but legalized whoredom? Who knows any distinction? Can love be forced? And yet love with a wife is forced by the covenant and the laws. Is not a partner's love, sexual love? So universal is this love, it exists even among birds and beasts. What is marital love but love for the sex? And sexual love is possible toward every woman.

Quondam in Mundo Spirituum audivi magnum tumultum; erant Chiliades congregati, qui clamabant, puniantur, puniantur: accessi propius, et quaesivi, "quid hoc;" dixit mihi unus e magna illa Congregatione separatus, quod in excandescentia irae sint contra tres Sacerdotes, qui circumvagantur, et ubivis praedicant contra adulteros, dicendo, quod Adulteris non sit agnitio Dei, et quod illis Coelum occlusum sit, ac Infernum apertum; et quod in Inferno sint diaboli immundi, quia e longinquo apparent ibi sicut porci volutantes se in stercoribus, et quod Angeli Coeli illos abominentur.

danturne presbyteri et monachi tales; num illi propterea non possunt agnoscere et colere Deum; cur itaque tres illi praedicant, quod adulteris non sit agnitio Dei; tales blasphemias non toleramus, quare judicentur et puniantur."</p><p>[4] Posthaec vidi, quod vocarent Judices, quos rogaverunt, ut poenas illis irrogarent; sed Judices dicebant, "hoc nostri muneris non est, nam agitur de Agnitione Dei, et de Peccato, et sic de salvatione et damnatione; de his judicabitur e Coelo: sed consilium dabimus, quomodo scire potestis, num tres illi Sacerdotes praedicaverint veritates; sunt tria Loca, quae nos Judices novimus, ubi talia singulari modo explorantur et revelantur; Unus est, ubi omnibus patet via in Coelum, sed dum in Coelum veniunt, percipiunt ipsi quales sunt quoad Agnitionem Dei: Secundus locus est, ubi etiam patet via in Coelum, sed viam illam intrare nemo potest, nisi qui Coelum in se habet: et Tertius locus est, ubi via est ad Infernum, et viam illam intrant ex spontaneo, quia ex jucundo, qui infernalia amant: nos Judices ad illa Loca amandamus omnes, qui de Coelo et Inferno judicium a nobis postulant."</p><p>[5] His auditis dixerunt congregati, "eamus ad illa Loca;" et cum iverunt ad Primum, ubi omnibus patet via in Coelum, subito facta est caligo, quare aliqui ex illis accendebant faces et praetulerunt; judices cum illis dicebant, "hoc fit omnibus qui ad Primum locum vadunt, at sicut appropinquant, ignis facularum fit hebetior, et in illo loco ex luce coeli influente exstinguitur, quod signum est quod ibi sint; causa est, quia primum occluditur illis Coelum, et postea aperitur:" et venerunt in locum illum, et exstinctis faculis a seipsis, videbant viam tendentem oblique sursum in Coelum; illam intrabant illi qui in excandescentia irae contra Sacerdotes erant; inter primos illi qui Adulteri ex proposito erant, post illos qui Adulteri ex confirmato erant; et in ascendendo primi clamabant, "sequimini," et sequentes clamabant, "festinate," et urgebant:</p><p>[6] post horulam, cum omnes intus in coelesti Societate erant, apparuit hiatus inter illos et inter Angelos, et Lux Coeli super hiatum influens in oculos aperiebat interiora mentis illorum, ex quo tenebantur loqui sicut interius cogitabant; et tunc sciscitabantur ab Angelis, num agnoscant quod Deus sit; responderunt Primi, qui ex proposito voluntatis erant adulteri, "Quid Deus," et aspexerunt se mutuo, et dixerunt, "quis vestrum vidit Illum:" Secundi, qui ex confirmatione intellectus erant adulteri, dixerunt, "suntne Naturae omnia; quid supra illam nisi Sol:" et tunc Angeli dixerunt illis, "discedite a nobis; nunc ipsi percipitis quod vobis non sit agnitio Dei; quando descenditis, claudentur <sup>3</sup>interiora mentis vestrae, et aperientur exteriora ejus, et tunc potestis loqui contra interiora, et dicere quod Deus sit; credite, quod ut primum homo actualiter fit adulter, occludatur illi Coelum, quo occluso Deus non agnoscitur; audite causam; ex adulteriis est omne immundum inferni, et hoc putet in Coelo sicut putre coenum platearum." His auditis, converterunt se, et descenderunt per tres vias; et cum infra erant, Primi et Secundi inter se colloquuti dicebant, "vicerunt ibi Sacerdotes, sed scimus quod nos aeque ac illi possimus loqui de Deo, et cum loquimur quod sit, annon agnoscimus Illum; Interiora et Exteriora mentis, de quibus Angeli narrabant, sunt inventa. Sed ad secundum Locum a Judicibus designatum, ubi via patet in Coelum illis, qui Coelum in se habent, ita illis qui in Coelum venturi sunt, abeamus;"</p><p>[7] et cum accesserunt, exivit vox e Coelo illo, "claudite portas, Adulteri in propinquo sunt;" et subito clausae sunt portae, et custodes cum baculis in manibus abegerunt illos; et tres Sacerdotes, contra quos tumultuati sunt, exemerunt custodia, et in Coelum introduxerunt: et illico, cum Porta pro Sacerdotibus aperta erat, e Coelo afflabat rebelles jucundum conjugii, quod quia castum et purum erat, paene exanimabat illos, quare ex timore deliquii a suffocatione properabant ad Tertium locum, de quo Judices dixerunt, quod inde via ad Infernum esset, et tunc inde efflabat jucundum adulterii, ex quo ita vivificati sunt illi, qui ex proposito et qui ex confirmato erant adulteri, ut quasi saltando descenderent, et se sicut porci ibi immergerent immundis. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p> 1.&nbsp;Prima editio: adul erii<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: bestias (absque puncto)<br><br>3.&nbsp;Prima editio: claudenrur </p>
