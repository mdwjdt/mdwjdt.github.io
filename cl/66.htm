<h4 align="center"></h4><p>66、从人类被造是为了成就这爱的事实，以及他们在其影响下的后续发展也能明显得出这个结论。男性被造是要凭借对变得智慧之爱而变成智慧；而女性被造是要凭借、因而照着男性的智慧而变成对男性的爱。由此明显可知，夫妻二人正是爱与智慧，或良善与真理的婚姻之形式和肖像。必须清楚的是，良善或真理若不存在于作为其主体的实物当中，是不存在的。抽象的良善和真理不可能存在，因为它们没有一个居所，无处可去。当然，它们也不能被视为空中的飘浮物。因此它们是纯粹的实体，表面上看，理性似乎能抽象地思考它们，而事实上，这是不可能的，除非它们在主体中。人所具有的一切概念，即便得到升华，也都是实物的，也就是说，附着于实物。必须进一步知道，实物若无形式，就无法存在。不成形的实物什么也不是，因为它没有任何属性，没有属性的主体也是非理性的实体。补充这些哲学思考是为了让人们以这种方式明白，享有婚姻真爱的夫妻二人正是良善与真理，或爱与智慧的婚姻之形式。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>66、从人的产生也可以清楚看到这一点。男人从创世时起就是一种智慧的形式，他们渴望变得明智。女人从创世起就是一种热爱男性的智慧的形式。由此，很明显夫妻双方是爱和智慧或都说是善和真理相结合的反应。</p><p>应知道的是没有任何善或真理的存在不是有一些什么实在事物为前提的。抽象的善和真理不存在，因为它们没有任何事物做为基础。一个人任何的想法，不论如何高深，它都是以实在物质为基础的。</p><p>另外应该知道的是没有任何实在事物不是从一种形式而存在的。没有形式的事物不能成为事物，因为它没有属性。没有任何属性的事物是一种空想。</p><p>我在此加入这些哲学上的观点是因为要说明存在于真正的婚姻之爱中的夫妻是在真理和善相结合的形式，或者说是爱和智慧相结合的形式。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #66 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>66. The same conclusions can obviously be drawn from the fact that human beings were created to fulfil that love, and from their subsequent development under its influence. The male was created to become wisdom as the result of the love of being wise, and woman was created to become the love of the male as the result of and in proportion to his wisdom. Hence it is plain that a married couple are really forms and images of the marriage of love and wisdom, that is, of good and truth. It must be appreciated that neither good nor truth can exist unless embodied in substance, as its own realisation. Abstract kinds of good and truth cannot exist, for lacking a position there is nowhere they can be; nor can they even appear transiently like flying creatures. They are therefore mere entities, about which it appears possible for reason to think in abstract, yet it is impossible unless they are embodied in realisations. For any idea a person forms, however lofty, is substantial, that is, attached to substances. In addition it needs to be known that no substance can exist without being a form. Nor is there such a thing as an unformed substance, since nothing can be predicated of it, and a subject without predicated qualities is also an irrational entity. These philosophical considerations are added to make it possible to see that a married couple, who live in truly conjugial love, really are forms of the marriage of good and truth, or love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #66 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>66. The same idea clearly follows from the creation of human beings into this love, and from their formation as a result of it afterwards. The male was created to become a form of wisdom from a love of growing wise, and the female was created to become a form of love for the male on account of his wisdom, thus in accordance with that wisdom. It is evident from this that two partners are real forms and reflections of the marriage between love and wisdom or between good and truth.<p>It should properly be known that no good or truth exists which is not the attribute of some concrete thing in which it inheres as a quality in its subject. Abstract goods and truths have no real existence, because they are not grounded in anything, having no underlying foundation. Indeed, neither can they be seen as flitting about in the air. Consequently, as abstractions they are merely figments, which reason supposes it can think about abstractly, but which it really cannot except as attributes of concrete subjects. For every idea a person has, however extrapolated, is concrete, that is to say, it is attached to concrete things.<p>It should further be known that no concrete thing exists without having form. A thing unformed is not anything, because nothing can be predicated of it, and a subject without predicates is also the figment of a fanciful imagination.<p>I have added these philosophical considerations in order to be able to show in this way as well that two married partners who are in a state of truly conjugial love actually are forms of the marriage between goodness and truth, or between love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #66 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>66. You can see that the same thing is confirmed by the fact that people are created for that love and later are formed by it. A man is created to become wisdom, motivated by a love of being wise, and a woman is created to become love of a man for his wisdom, which is to say according to his wisdom. It is clear from this that two partners are the very form and image of a marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth.<p>It is well to know that there is neither any good nor truth except in a substance, as its material form. Abstract good and truth do not exist, for they are nowhere, since they have nowhere to be. Why, they cannot even appear fleetingly, so they are just things that your mind thinks it is pondering abstractly, although it is quite incapable of thinking except in relation to objects. For all human ideas, even the sublime ones, are substantial - that is, attached to substance. Note, too, that there is no substance unless there is a form. A substance without form is not anything, either, because you cannot attribute anything to it, and a subject with no qualities is a theoretical nonentity.<p>I added these philosophical remarks to show in this way, too, that two partners who enjoy real love in marriage are actually forms of the marriage of good and truth, or of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #66 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>66. The same is clearly evident from the creation of men into this love, and from their subsequent formation by it. The male was created that he might become wisdom from the love of growing wise, and the female that she might become the love of the male from his wisdom and so according to it. It is clear from this, that two married partners are the very forms and effigies of the marriage of love and wisdom or of good and truth. It must be clearly recognized that there is no good nor any truth which is not in a substance as its subject. Abstract goods and truths, being nowhere because they have no abode, are not possible. They certainly cannot be seen as things floating in the air. Therefore they are mere entities, of which reason seems to think abstractly but of which, nevertheless, it cannot think unless they are in subjects. For all man's ideas, even though sublimated, are substantial, that is, are attached to substances. It must further be recognized that there can be no substance unless it be a form. A substance not formed is not anything, for nothing can be predicted of it, and a subject without predicates is also an entity of no reason. These philosophic considerations are added, that in this way also it may be seen that two married partners who are in love truly conjugial are actually forms of the marriage of good and truth or love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #66 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>66. How two become the very form of marital love is evident also from the creation of human beings into that love, and from their origination from it afterwards. The male is created to become wisdom through the love of being wise, and the female is created to become the love of the man for his wisdom and according to it. Plainly, then, two partners are the very forms and effigies of the marriage of love and wisdom or of good and truth. It is clearly to be understood that neither good nor truth occurs apart from a substance as its subject. Disembodied goods and truths are not to be found, for they do not exist, having no abode, and cannot even appear as fugitive entities. They may seem entities of which reason can think, but still it cannot conceive of them except in given subjects, for every human image or idea, however sublimated, is substantial, that is, attaches to substances. It is also to be known that there is no such thing as substance which is not also form. Substance with no assignable form is also nothing, for nothing can be predicated of it, and a subject without predicates is no rational entity. We add these philosophic considerations to show in this way, too, that two partners who are in true marital love are actually forms of the marriage of good and truth or of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #66 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>66. The same clearly appears from the creation of mankind into this love, and from their formation from it afterwards. The male was so created that he might become wisdom from the love of growing wise; and the female, so that she might become the love of the male from his wisdom and so according to it. It is plain from this that two married partners are very forms and effigies of the marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth.<p>It is to be well-known that there is neither good nor truth which is not in a substance as in its subject. There are no abstract goods and truths; for they are nowhere because they have no abiding-place. Nay, they cannot even appear as fleeting things. They are, therefore, merely entities about which reason seems to itself to think abstractly, but yet of which it cannot think except in subjects. For every idea of man, even the sublimest is substantial, that is, affixed to substances. Moreover it should be known that there is no substance except it be a form. A substance not formed is not anything; for nothing can be predicated of it, and a subject without predicates is likewise not a rational entity. These philosophic considerations are added that it may be seen by them also, that two married partners who are in love truly conjugial are actually forms of the marriage of good and truth, or of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #66 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>66. Simile evidenter constat ex Creatione hominum in illum amorem, et ex formatione illorum ex illo postea; Masculus creatus est ut fiat sapientia ex amore sapiendi, et Foemina creata est ut fiat Amor masculi ex sapientia ejus, ita secundum illam; ex quo patet, quod duo conjuges sint ipsae formae et effigies Conjugii amoris et sapientiae, seu boni et veri. Probe sciendum est, quod non detur bonum nec verum, quod non sit in substantia ut in suo subjecto; bona et vera abstracta non dantur, sunt enim nullibi quia non habent sedem, imo nec possunt apparere sicut volantia, quare sunt modo entia, de quibus ratio videtur sibi abstracte cogitare, sed usque non potest nisi in subjectis, nam omnis idea hominis, etiam sublimata, est substantialis, hoc est, affixa substantiis: insuper sciendum est, quod non detur substantia nisi sit forma; substantia non formata nec est aliquid, quia de illa non aliquid potest praedicari, ac subjectum absque praedicatis est quoque ens nullius rationis: haec Philosophica adjecta sunt, ut sic etiam videri possit, quod duo Conjuges, qui in amore vere conjugiali sunt, actualiter sint Formae Conjugii boni et veri, seu amoris et sapientiae. </p>
