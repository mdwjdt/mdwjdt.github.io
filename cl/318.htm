<h4 align="center"></h4><p>318、⑴一方配偶死后，是否再婚取决于以前的婚姻之爱。真正的婚姻之爱就像一架天平，能权衡再婚的倾向。以前的婚姻之爱越接近真爱，再婚的倾向就越消退。相反，以前的婚姻之爱越远离真爱，再婚的倾向就越增长。原因是显而易见的，因为婚姻之爱与心智的联结在程度上是同等的；一方配偶死后，只要对方仍活在世上，这种联结就会持续下去；它将再婚的倾向保持在平衡中，如同保持在一架天平上，根据真爱归为己有的程度而使天平倾斜。但是，由于现在很少有人靠近这爱，顶多迈出几步，所以对大多数人来说，天平接受了倾向的附加重量后，通常上升到平衡点，然后在那里摇摆一下，就偏向另一侧，也就是婚姻那一侧。<br><br>对那些前一段婚姻中的爱情远离真正婚姻之爱的人来说，情况则截然相反。这是因为远离这爱与心智的分离在程度上是同等的。一方配偶死后，只要对方仍活在世上，这种分离也会持续下去，并进入对方与配偶意愿分离的意愿，导致倾向于一个新的联结。在这种意愿倾向促使下，朝此方向的思维会带来以一种更紧密、更令人愉快的联结而共同生活的希望。<br><br>再婚的倾向是由以前的爱情状态产生的，这是众所周知的。此外，理性也能看清这一点，因为真正的婚姻之爱含有失去的恐惧和随失去而来的悲伤，这种恐惧和悲伤就处于心智的至内在区域。正因如此，由这爱所产生的这些情感越是同在，思维和意愿，因而意图中的灵魂就越倾向于和它原来与之同在并存在于其中的那个人同在。由此可知，心智照着它在前一段婚姻中所体验的爱情程度而与另一段婚姻保持抗衡。正是这爱使得夫妻死后会重新结合，像在世时那样彼此恩爱。不过，如前所述，现在这样的爱情极其罕见，人们几乎连手指都没触碰过它。那些没有触及它的人，尤其那些相差甚远的人，死后都渴望与另一个女人或男人结合，就像他们在前一段冷淡的婚姻生活中渴望分离那样。我们将在下文详细讨论这两类人。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>318、（1）配偶死后是否再婚，取决于从前的婚姻之爱。真正的婚姻之爱是权衡是否再婚的条件。前次婚姻中的爱越是与真正的婚姻之爱接近，人就会越不倾向于再婚，前次婚姻中的爱与真正的婚姻之爱相差得越远，再婚的倾向就会越强。</p><p>原因很清楚，因为婚姻之爱是衡量头脑的联合程度和这种联合在配偶死后在另一方身上存留程度的标准。这种联合象法码一样平衡着是否再婚与独身。（但是因为如今很少有人有完全的真正的婚姻之爱，所以天平会倾向再婚一侧）</p><p>那些从前婚姻中的爱与真正的婚姻之爱互不相联的情况则相反，因为与真正的婚姻之爱毫不相联，他们的头脑也是分离的，这种分离状态会继续存在于在世的一方身上。它会使人产生形成一种新的结合的倾向。希望有一种爱密切的联系。</p><p>众所周知，再婚的倾向与从前的婚姻之爱的状态有关。因为与真正的婚姻之爱同在的是对失去它的恐惧，失去它后会使人内心产生悲哀，这种悲哀会存在于人的最深处。因此若那种爱所产生的这种状况存在，人的灵魂、思想和意愿，就会倾向于保持一个配偶相团聚并象在世间一样爱对方。</p><p>然而，正如前面所提过的，这种爱在如今是不多的。有人得不到它，有人与它背道而弛，所以在配偶死后，他们会希望与另外一人相结合。</p><p>以下会对这两种人做更多的讲述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #318 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>318. (i) Contracting a second marriage after the death of a partner depends upon the previous conjugial love.<p>Truly conjugial love is like a balance, enabling the inclination towards a second marriage to be weighed. The closer the previous conjugial love approaches to that love, the further the inclination to a second marriage recedes. But the further the previous love departs from that love, the more the inclination towards a second marriage grows. The reason is obvious, since conjugial love is to the same extent a linking of minds, which outlasts the death of one partner, so long as the other lives in the body; and this linking tips the inclination of the scale in the balance, adding weight in proportion to the extent that true love is made one's own. But since it is rare nowadays for more then a few steps to be taken towards this love, the scale which receives the additional weight of inclination usually rises to a level point, and from there wavers and tips in the other direction, that is, towards marriage.</p><p>[2] It is quite the reverse in the case of those whose previous love in their former marriage departed from truly conjugial love. This is because a departure from this is to the same extent a parting of minds. This too outlasts the death of one partner, so long as the other lives in the body, and entering the will, which is parted from the other's, causes an inclination towards a new link. Thinking about this, provoked by the inclination of the will, brings hope of living together in a closer and more pleasant union.</p><p>[3] It is well known, and can be seen by reason, that inclinations towards second marriages arise from the previous state of love. For truly conjugial love contains a fear of loss, with pain following on the loss, and this pain and this fear are in the innermost regions of the mind. Hence it is that the more of that love is present, the more the soul inclines in will and thought, that is, in intention, towards being in the person with and in whom it was. It follows from this that how far the mind is kept tipping towards another marriage depends upon the degree of love previously experienced. This is what makes the same partners reunited after death, and likewise makes them love each other in the world. But, as I said before, this love is nowadays rare, and there are few who come within touching distance of it. Those who do not reach it, and even more those who fall far short of it, long to be linked after death with another woman or man, just as in the life they spent together before death, a cold one, they longed to be separated. Both these groups will be further discussed in the following pages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #318 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>318. 1. Whether to marry again after the death of a partner depends on the conjugial love had previously. Truly conjugial love is the balance, so to speak, against which inclinations to remarry are weighed. The nearer the conjugial love had previously is to truly conjugial love, the more removed is an inclination to marry again; whereas the more removed the previous love is from truly conjugial love, the more present usually is an inclination towards remarriage.<p>The reason is clear to see, because conjugial love is in the same measure a conjunction of minds, and the conjunction remains during the bodily life of the one after the passing of the other. This conjunction holds any inclination to remarry in balance as though in a scale, and tips the scale its way to the degree that true love has been embraced. (Though because rarely does anyone today progress more than a few steps towards such a love, therefore the tongue of the balance for the most part rises to the point of equilibrium, and wavering there, goes over to the other side, that is, to the side of remarriage.)</p><p>[2] The converse is the case with people whose love before in the previous marriage departed from truly conjugial love. That is because a departure from it is in the same measure a disjunction of minds, and the disjunction likewise remains during the bodily life of the one after the passing of the other. This disjunction enters a will estranged from the will of the other and engenders an inclination towards a new union. Thought then in that direction, prompted by an inclination of the will, introduces hope of a more united and thus more congenial cohabitation.</p><p>[3] It is common knowledge that inclinations to marry again arise in accordance with the state of the love had before; and this reason also sees. For inherent in truly conjugial love is a fear of its being lost, and following its loss, grief - a fear and grief which occupy the innermost recesses of people's minds. Consequently, to the degree these emotions are present as a result of that love, to the same degree the soul, in both thought and will, and so in intention, inclines to remain with the person with whom and in whom it was. It follows from this that the mind is held counterbalanced against a second marriage according to the degree of the love which it had before. So it is that the same partners are reunited after death and love each other again as in the world.<p>However, as indicated above, such a love today is rare, and there are few who touch it with even a finger. People who do not attain it, and still more those who depart far from it - according as they wished for separation in their married life before (which was cold), so after the death of the partner they wish for union with another.<p>But we will say more about these two classes of people in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #318 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>318. 1. Remarriage after the death of a partner depends on the married love that preceded. Real married love is like a balance, weighing your inclinations to marry again. In the measure that the previous married love approached true married love, the inclination to remarry goes away, and in the measure that the previous love veered off from true married love, an inclination to marry again tends to enter. The obvious reason is that married love is a union of minds, which stays in the bodily life of the one after the other's death, and it holds the inclination like the tray in a pair of scales. It tips the scales according to the true love involved. But today it is rare to approach more than a few steps toward this love, so the scale of the overriding inclination usually rises to the balance point and from there dips and inclines to the other side - that is, to marriage.<p>It is the opposite with people whose previous love, in their foregoing marriage, veered off from the real love in marriage. The reason is that veering away from it is a separation of minds. This tendency, too, stays in the bodily life of the one after the other's death, and it enters the will of the one - the will disjoined from the other's will - and makes an inclination toward a new union. The thinking that the will's inclination introduces is in favor of this and it introduces hope of a more united and thus happier relationship.<p>It is well known that inclinations to remarry spring from the condition of the previous love, and reason sees this, too. For true married love has in it a fear of loss, and after loss, grief, and this grief and that fear are in the most inward parts of the partners' minds. So however much true married love there is in it, that is how much a soul inclines, both in will and in thought - that is, in intention - to be in the person that it was with and was in. Consequently, your mind is held in balance about a second marriage according to the degree of love it enjoyed in the first.<p>On account of this, the same two people are reunited after death, and they love each other just as they did in the world. But, as said before, that love is rare today, and few lay a finger on it.<p>And those who do not touch it - more so, those who back far off from it - long to join with another woman or another man, after death, as much as they longed for separation from their partner in their past life, which was frigid.<p>But more about these things is in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #318 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>318. I. THAT AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PARTNER, AGAIN TO CONTRACT MATRIMONY DEPENDS ON THE PRECEDING CONJUGIAL LOVE. Love truly conjugial is as a balance in which inclinations to repeated marriages are weighed. In the degree that the preceding conjugial love approaches that love, the inclination to marry again recedes; but in the degree that the preceding love recedes from it, the inclination to marry again is wont to make advance. The reason is obvious; for in the same degree, conjugial love is a conjunction of minds, and after the death of the one, this conjunction remains during the bodily life of the other, and, like the tongue in a balance, holds the inclination, making preponderance according to the appropriation of true love. But since an approach to this love is rarely made at the present day, unless by a few steps, therefore, for the most part, the scale containing the preponderance of inclination rises to the point of equilibrium and then wavers and tends to the other side, that is, to marriage.</p><p>[2] So likewise with those whose preceding love in the former marriage receded from love truly conjugial. The reason is because recession from that love is in the same degree a disjunction of minds, and after the decease of the one, this disjunction remains during the bodily life of the other, and, entering a will disjoined from the will of the other, it produces an inclination to a new conjunction. In favor of this, the thought, brought in by the inclination of the will, carries with it the hope of a more united and thus more delightful cohabitation.</p><p>[3] That inclinations to repeated marriages take their rise from the state of the preceding love is well known. Moreover, reason sees it; for within love truly conjugial is fear of its loss and grief after the loss, and this grief and fear are in the inmost regions of the mind. Hence it is, that so far as that love is within, so far the soul inclines, both in will and thought, that is, in intention, to be in the subject with which and in which it had been. It follows from this that, as regards another marriage, the mind is held in poise according to the degree of love in which it had been in the former marriage. It is from this love that the same partners are reunited after death and mutually love each other in like manner as in the world. But, as said above, at this day this love is rare, there being few who touch it even with the finger. As to those who do not touch it, and still more those who recede far from it, these, according as they had longed for separation during their preceding married life which was cold, so after death they desire conjunction with another. But more concerning these two classes of men in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #318 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>318. (i) Contracting marriage again after the partner's death depends on the preceding marital love. True marital love is like scales in which inclinations to remarriage are weighed. In the degree in which the previous marital love approximated true marital love, the inclination to marry again declines; but in the degree in which the previous love fell short of true marital love, inclination is wont to welcome another marriage. The reason is plain. Marital love is in its measure a union of minds. This union persists in a partner's earthly life after the other's death, controls the inclinations as though in a pair of scales, and makes a preponderance in the measure in which true love was attained. But approximation to true marital love is rare at the present day, other than by a few steps, and therefore the scales move for the most part only to the point of equilibrium or still tend and incline the other way, that is, toward remarriage. Not so much as this is true of those whose love in the previous marriage fell short of true marital love.</p><p>[2] For failure of true love is in its measure a disunion of minds. This disunion also persists in a partner's earthly life after the other's death, and enters the will, which was disjoined from the other's will, and causes inclination to a new union. Influenced in favor of another union by the affection of the will, the thought entertains the hope of a closer and hence pleasanter cohabitation.</p><p>[3] Every one knows that inclinations to remarriage grow out of the state of the earlier love. The reason also sees it, for true marital love is accompanied by fear of losing it and grief over losing it, a grief and fear which are in the very inmosts of the mind. Hence it is that so far as one is in that love, so far the soul inclines both in will and thought, that is, in intention, to remain in the beloved subject with which and in which it was. It follows that the mind is held balanced about another marriage according to the degree of love which it felt in the previous marriage. As a result, after death the same partners are reunited and love each other mutually as they did in the world. But, as we said above, such love is rare today; there are few who even graze it with the finger-tip. Those who do not attain it, and still more those who fall far short of it, desire a union after death with some other in the measure in which they desired separation in their life with the partner, which was a cold life. But of both cases more in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #318 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>318. (1) That whether to contract matrimony again after the death of a married partner depends upon the preceding conjugial love. Love truly conjugial is as a balance in which inclinations to marry again are weighed. In the degree that the preceding conjugial love approximates to that love the inclination to marry again recedes; and in the degree that the preceding love departs from that love the inclination to marry again is wont to draw near. The reason is obvious, because conjugial love is in a like degree a conjunction of minds, which continues in the bodily life of one after the decease of the other; and this holds the inclination, like the tongue in the balance, and makes the preponderance according to the appropriation of true love. But as an approach to this love is rarely made at this day, unless for a few steps, the scale of preponderance of inclination commonly raises itself to the point of equilibrium, and from this point tends and inclines to the other side, that is, to marriage. The contrary is the case with those whose preceding love in the former marriage drew away from love truly conjugial. The reason is, that recession from that love is in a like degree a disjunction of minds, which also continues in the life of the body of the one after the death of the other, and enters the will, disconnected from the will of the other, and causes an inclination to a new conjunction, in favor of which the thought, introduced by the inclination of the will, brings in the hope of a more united and thus more delightful cohabitation. That the inclinations to repeated marriages take their rise from the state of the preceding love is known. And reason sees it also; for inherent in love truly conjugial is the fear of loss, and grief after loss, and this grief and that fear are in the very inmosts of the mind. Hence it is that just so far as that love is in them, so far the soul inclines, both in will and thought, that is in intention, to be in the subject with which and in which it was. It follows from this that the mind is held in poise as to another marriage, according to the degree of love in which it was in the former. Hence it is that the same are reunited after death and mutually love each other in like manner as in the world. But, as was said above, at this day that love is rare, and they are few who touch it with the finger, and those that do not touch it, and more yet, those that wander far away from it, as they longed for separation during the past life with the consort, which was cold, so after the death they desire conjunction with another. But more will be said of both of these in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #318 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>318. I: Quod post mortem conjugis iterum contrahere matrimonium dependeat a praecedente amore conjugiali. Est amor vere conjugialis sicut lanx, qua inclinationes ad conjugia iterata ponderantur; quantum amor conjugialis praecedens ad illum amorem accedit, tantum inclinatio ad iteratum conjugium recedit, at quantum amor praecedens recedit ab illo amore, tantum inclinatio ad alterum conjugium solet accedere: causa in propatulo est, quia amor conjugialis est in simili gradu conjunctio mentium, quae in vita corporis unius manet post obitum alterius, et haec tenet inclinationem sicut trutinam in bilance, et facit superpondium secundum veri amoris appropriationem: sed quia accessio ad hunc amorem raro hodie fit nisi ad aliquot passus, ideo scala superpondii inclinationis ut plurimum attollit se ad aequationem, et ex hac nutat et protendit ad alteram partem, hoc est, ad conjugium.</p><p>[2] Contrarium est apud illos, quorum amor praecedens in conjugio priori ab amore vere conjugiali recessit; causa est, quia recessio ab illo in simili gradu est disjunctio mentium, quae etiam in vita corporis unius manet post obitum alterius, et haec intrat voluntatem ab alterius disjunctam, et facit inclinationem ad conjunctionem novam; pro qua cogitatio illata ab inclinatione voluntatis infert spem de unitiore, et sic jucundiore cohabitatione.</p><p>[3] Quod inclinationes ad iterata conjugia trahant suum ortum ex statu praecedentis amoris, notum est, et quoque ratio hoc videt; amori enim vere conjugiali inest timor jacturae, et post jacturam dolor, et hic dolor et ille timor est in ipsis intimis mentium; inde est, quod quantum ex illo amore inest, tantum anima inclinet et voluntate et cogitatione, hoc est, intentione, ut sit in subjecto cum quo et in quo fuit; ex his sequitur, quod mens in libra teneatur ad alterum conjugium secundum gradum amoris in quo fuit in priori; ex hoc est, quod post mortem iidem reuniantur, ac similiter, ut in Mundo, se mutuo ament: sed, ut supra dictum est, hodie est ille amor rarus, et sunt pauci, qui digito attingunt illum, et illi qui non attingunt, et plus qui ab illo procul recedunt, hi sicut cupiverunt separationem in vita consorte anteacta, quae frigida fuit, ita post mortem cupiunt conjunctionem cum alia seu alio: sed de his et illis plura in sequentibus. </p>
