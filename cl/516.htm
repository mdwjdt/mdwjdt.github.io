<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第516节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>516、属灵婚姻表示主与教会的婚姻（对此，参看116-131节）；因而也表示良善与真理的婚姻（参看83-102节）。由于主与教会，因而良善与真理的这种婚姻存在于圣言的一切细节中，故对该婚姻的侵犯就是所谓的对属灵婚姻的侵犯。因为教会出自圣言，而圣言就是主。主就是圣言，因为祂是圣言中的神性良善与神性真理。我在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（80-90节）已充分证实，圣言就是该婚姻。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>516、在此精神性的婚姻是指主和教会的结合，这在前面116-131节中讲过，还指善与真理的结合，这在83-102节中讲过。因为主与教会的结合以及善与真理的结合存在于《圣经》中的每一处，对这种结合的侵犯就是我们在此所讲的对精神性婚姻的侵害。因为教会建立于《圣经》之上，而《圣经》就是主。因为主就是《圣经》中的善与真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #516 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>516. The spiritual marriage means the marriage of the Lord and the church (on which see above <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>). As a result it also means the marriage of good and truth (also dealt with above <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). Since this marriage of the Lord and the church, and hence of good and truth, is present in every detail of the Word, it is the violation of this which is here meant by the violation of the spiritual marriage. For the church comes from the Word, and the Word is the Lord. The Lord is the Word, because He is the Divine good and the Divine truth in it. A full proof that the Word is that marriage may be seen in <a href="../ss/80.htm">DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 80-90</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #516 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>516. By the spiritual marriage we mean the marriage of the Lord and the church, spoken of above in nos. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>, and so also the marriage between goodness and truth, spoken of above as well, in nos. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>. And because this marriage of the Lord and the church and consequently a marriage of good and truth exists in each and every particular of the Word, it is a violation of this marriage that is meant here by violation of the spiritual marriage. For the church is founded on the Word, and the Word is the Lord. The Word is the Lord because He is the Divine good and Divine truth in it.<p>That the Word consists of such a marriage may be seen fully attested in <a href="../ss/80.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. 80-90</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #516 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>516. Spiritual marriage means the marriage of the Lord and the church (see nos. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>, above) and therefore also marriage of good and truth (also mentioned above, nos. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>), and because this is a marriage of the Lord and the church and therefore a marriage of good and truth, it is in each and every thing in the Word. It is violation of this that violation of spiritual marriage means here, for the church is from the Word, and the Word is the Lord. The Lord is the Word, because He is the Divine Good and Divine Truth in it. You can see it fully established in Doctrine for the New Jerusalem Concerning the Sacred Scriptures (nos. <a href="../ss/80.htm">80-90</a>) that the Word is that marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #516 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>516. By spiritual marriage is meant the marriage of the Lord and the Church, of which above (nos. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>); and thence also the marriage of good and truth, of which likewise above (nos. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). And because this marriage of the Lord and the Church, and hence the marriage of good and truth, is in each and every thing of the Word, it is the violation of this marriage that is meant here by the violation of spiritual marriage; for the Church is from the Word, and the Word is the Lord. The Lord is the Word because He is the Divine Good and the Divine Truth therein. That the Word is that marriage may be seen fully confirmed in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURES, nos. <a href="../ss/80.htm">80-90</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #516 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>516. By spiritual marriage is meant the marriage of the Lord and the Church (of which above, n. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>) and hence also the marriage of good and truth (of which also above, n. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). This marriage of the Lord and the Church and hence the marriage of good and truth are in each and all things of the Word, and therefore violation of the Word is meant in this chapter by the violation of spiritual marriage, for the Church is from the Word, and the Word is the Lord. The Lord is the Word because He is the Divine Good and Truth in it. The reader may see it fully established that the Word is such a marriage in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem on the Sacred Scripture (n. <a href="80.htm">80-90</a>). </p> 
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #516 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>516. By the spiritual marriage is meant the marriage of the Lord and the Church, of which above at n. 116-131; and thence also the marriage of good and truth, of which likewise above at n. 83-102. And as this marriage is of the Lord and the Church, and the marriage of good and truth thence is in all and the single things of the Word, it is the violation of this that is meant here by the violation of the spiritual marriage; for the church is from the Word and the Word is the Lord. The Lord is the Word because He is the Divine good and the Divine truth therein. That the Word is that marriage may be seen fully confirmed in <a href="../ss/80.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem respecting the Sacred Scripture 80</a>-90. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #516 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>516. Per Conjugium spirituale intelligitur Conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae, de quo supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_516/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_116" target=_top>116-131</a>; et inde quoque Conjugium boni et veri, de quo etiam supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_516/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_83" target=_top>83-102</a>; et quia hoc Conjugium <sup>1</sup>Domini et Ecclesiae, et inde conjugium boni et veri, est in omnibus et singulis Verbi, est hujus violatio, quae per violationem conjugii spiritualis hic intelligitur, est enim Ecclesia ex Verbo, et Verbum est Dominus; Dominus est Verbum, quia est Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum ibi. Quod Verbum sit illud Conjugium, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_516/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_80" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 80-90</a>, plene confirmatum videatur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: Conjugium est </p>
