<h4 align="center"></h4><p>110、天使取出第七张纸，从中读到如下内容：“在隔间，借着窗户透过来的光，我们同胞因着默想婚姻之爱而使我们的思维和由此而来的判断变得活跃。谁没有因这爱兴奋过？当我们满脑子是这爱时，它同时不也充满我们整个身体吗？我们判断这爱的源头来自它的快乐。有谁知道或曾知道，若不凭爱的快乐和愉悦，就难觅爱的踪迹？婚姻之爱的快乐在其源头被感觉为祝福、幸福和快乐，随着它的行进而被感觉为愉悦和满足，在最低层则被感觉为无上的快乐。因此，当心智、因而身体的内层为这些快乐的流注而打开时，两性情爱就产生了。而婚姻之爱的出现，要等到这爱的初始气场通过开始订婚而从观念上发展这些快乐之时。至于这爱的活力或性能力，它由这爱的能力产生，并从心智流入身体。因为每当心灵感觉、作用，尤其体验出于这爱的快乐时，它就凭其头部中的所在处而存在于身体里面。我们由此判断出性能力的强度及其交替的恒常性。另外，我们还从家族推断性能力的活力。它若在父亲身上表现优秀，同样在继承它的后代身上表现优秀。理性加上经验表明，这种优秀能力通过传递而重现、继承和沿袭下去。”这张纸标注的字母是F（法国）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>110、天使抽出第七张纸读道：</p><p>我们组的人感到我们对这一问题的判断受到了婚姻之爱的激励。有谁能不为其所激励呢？当这种爱充满头脑时，它也充满了人的整个身心。</p><p>“我们从婚姻之爱所带来的快乐来考虑它的来源，有谁见过没有快乐而有爱的存在呢？婚姻之爱在最初阶段感觉上象一种祝福，愉悦和幸福感，在接下来的阶段象是一种快乐的满足感，在最终阶段婚姻之爱就是一种最完美的愉悦。</p><p>“对异性的爱产生在人的头脑及身心可能体会到其快乐的时候，而婚姻之爱产生在订婚时，经过订婚阶段后，这种最初阶段的爱会使人真正理解婚姻之爱中的快乐。</p><p>“关于婚姻之爱的力量，它是由这种爱的能力及其从头脑流入到身体的结果，头脑在身体之中，并且决定身体如何行为，在感受到这种爱之中的快乐时更是这样，我们是这样判断婚姻之爱的力量的。</p><p>“另外，我们还认为这种爱的力量与遗传有关，若父亲在这方面强健，它也会遗传给后代，这一点不难看到。”</p><p>这一论断是来自法国人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #110 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>110. Then he took the seventh paper and read out from it as follows.<p>'We, the representatives in the room under the light of our window, have been much cheered in thinking and passing our judgments by meditating on conjugial love. Surely everyone is cheered by it; for when we have that love in our minds, it pervades at the same time the whole of our bodies. Our judgment is that the source of this love is from its pleasures. Does anyone know or has anyone ever known a trace of any love except from the pleasure and gratification it gives? The pleasures of conjugial love are experienced in its beginnings as blessedness, bliss and happiness; and as it progresses as loveliness and gratifications, and at the lowest level as the supreme delight. So sexual love arises as the interior of the mind, and so the interior of the body, is opened up, as those pleasures flood in. But conjugial love then arose when the earliest sphere of that love conceptually advanced those pleasures by starting formal engagements.<p>'As regards the strength or potency of that love, this is the product of that love's ability to penetrate, carrying its influence from the mind into the body. For the mind, when feeling and acting, leaves the head for the body, and especially when experiencing the delights of that love. We judge that to be the source of the degrees of potency and the regularity of its alternations. In addition, we think the strength of potency depends on breeding. If that is exceptional in the father, it is equally so in the offspring who inherit it. Reason combined with experience demands that it is inheritance which produces, passes on and transmits such excellence.' This paper was signed with the letter F. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #110 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>110. A seventh time the angel drew out a piece of paper, and he read from it the following opinion:<p>"We representatives in the room under the light from our window found our thoughts and our consequent judgments stimulated by reflecting on conjugial love. Who is not stimulated by this love? For when it fills the mind, it at the same time fills the whole body.<p>"We judge the origin of this love from its delights. Who knows or ever has known the path any love takes except from its delight and pleasure? The delights of conjugial love are felt in their origins as blessings, felicities, and states of happiness, in their derivative states as gratifications and pleasures, and in their final states as the most consummate of delights.<p>"Love for the opposite sex has its origin, therefore, when the inner faculties of the mind and thus the inner faculties of the body are opened to receive the inflowing of these delights; but the origin of conjugial love occurs at the time the states of engagement and betrothal begin and when through these states the first atmosphere of that love advances these delights into an real conception of them.<p>"With respect to the vigor or potency of conjugial love, this results from the capacity of this love and its flow to pass from the mind into the body. For the mind is in the body from the head whenever it feels and acts, especially when it is experiencing the delights of this love. We judge the degrees of its potency and the constancies of its successive expressions to be a consequence of this.<p>"Moreover, we also trace the vigor of its potency as coming from heredity. If it is superior in the father, it becomes also superior by transmission in the offspring. Reason agrees with experience that this superior ability is by transmission reproduced, inherited, and passed down."<p>This statement was signed below with the letter F. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #110 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>110. He pulled out the seventh paper and read this from it:<p>"We countrymen in our room under the light of our window have enjoyed our thoughts and our verdict from them by contemplating the love in marriage. Who would not be happy about it?<p>For when that love is on your mind it is in your whole body at the same time.<p>"We decided that the source of that love is its joys. Who knows or has known any trace of that love from anything but the pleasure and satisfaction of it? The joys of married love at their source feel like blessings, good fortune, and luck, and as they trickle down from there, they feel like passions and delights, and they end up in the pleasure of all pleasures. So the origin of sexual love is when the inner workings of our mind, and therefore of our body, open up to let those joys flow in. But married love began when its aura first produced it archetypally through the exchange of vows.<p>"As to the vigor or potency of this love, it comes from the love's ability to pass from your mind to your body in its flow, for your mind is not in your head, but in your body when it feels or acts - especially when enjoying this love. We think the degree of potency and the constancy with which it returns are from that.<p>We also trace the vigor of potency from lineage. If it is excellent in a father it is excellent when passed on to his offspring. Reason and experience agree that this excellence does get reproduced, inherited, and handed down."<p>This was signed F. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #110 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>110. For the SEVENTH time the angel drew out a paper, from which he read as follows: "In the chamber under the light of our window, we compatriots have enlivened our thoughts and hence our judgment by meditation upon conjugial love. Who is there that would not be enlivened by that love? for when in the mind, it is at the same time in the whole body. We judge of the origin of the love from its delights. Who knows or ever has known a trace of any love except from its delight and pleasure? The delights of conjugial love are felt in their origins as blessedness, happiness, and felicity, in their derivations as amenities and pleasures, and in their ultimates as the delight of delights. Love of the sex, therefore, has its origin when the interiors of the mind and thence the interiors of the body are being opened up for the influx of these delights; but conjugial love has its origin when, by entry into betrothal, the primitive sphere of that love promotes them ideally. As regards the virtue or potency of that love, this comes from the ability of the love, with its current, to pass from the mind into the body; for when the mind sensates and acts, and especially when it is in delight from this love, then from its seat in the head it is present in the body. From this we judge the degrees of potency and the constancy of its alternations. Moreover, we also deduce the virtue of potency from the stock. If this be noble with the father, then by derivation it becomes noble with the offspring also. That such nobility is generated, inherited, and by derivation descends--as to this, reason agrees with experience." To this was subscribed the letter F. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #110 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>110. A seventh time the angel drew out a paper, from which he read as follows: "We compatriots in the chamber under the light of our window have exhilarated our thoughts and thence our judgments by meditation upon marital love. Who would not be exhilarated by that love? For when it is in the mind it is at the same time in the whole body. We judge of the origin of this love from its delights. Who has ever known anything whatever of any love except from the delight and pleasure of it? The delights of marital love are felt in their origins as beatitudes, satisfactions and felicities, and in their derivations as gladnesses and pleasures, and in ultimates as the delight of delights. Love of the sex therefore arises when the interiors of the mind and thence the interiors of the body are opened to the influx of those joys; but marital love arises when, through betrothings, the early sphere of this love further enhances the joys. As regards the vigor or potency of marital love, it comes from the fact that the stream of this love can pass from the mind into the body; for the mind is in the body from the head, when it is feeling and acting, especially when it is in delight from this love. Hence, we judge, are the degrees of potency and the constancy of its alternations. We also trace virile strength to the physical stock. If this is noble in the father, it is noble as transmitted to the offspring. That this nobility is reproduced, inherited and passed to descendants, is a fact on which reason agrees with experience." To this was subscribed the letter F. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #110 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>110. The seventh time he drew out a paper from which he read this: 'We compatriots in the chamber, under the light of our window, have exhilarated our thoughts, and thence our judgments, by meditation upon conjugial love. Who would not be exhilarated by it? For while that love is in the mind it is at the same time in the whole body. We judge of the origin of that love from its delights. Who knows or ever has known a trace of any love except from the delight and pleasure of it? The delights of conjugial love are felt in their origins as states of blessedness, satisfactions, and felicities; and in their derivations as sensations of loveliness and pleasure; and in their ultimates as the delight of delights. The origin of the love of the sex, therefore, is when the interiors of the mind and thence the interiors of the body are opened for the inflowing of these delights; and the origin of conjugial love was when, by betrothal begun, the primitive sphere of that love ideally promoted them. As regards the virtue or potency of that love, that comes from the ability of the love to pass through with its current from the mind into the body; for the mind from the head is in the body, while it is feeling and acting, especially while it is in delight from this love. Hence, we judge, are the degrees of potency and the constancy of its alternations. And besides we deduce the virtue of potency also from the stock. If that be noble in the father it becomes noble also by derivation with the offspring. That this nobility is reproduced, inherited, and descends by derivation, is a fact as to which reason agrees with experience.' To this was subscribed the letter F. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #110 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>110. Septimo eduxit chartam, e qua legit haec: "Nos populares in camera sub nostrae fenestrae luce exhilaravimus cogitationes et inde judicia nostra ex meditatione de Amore conjugiali; quis non exhilaratur ex illo, est enim ille amor dum in mente simul in toto corpore: nos judicamus Originem amoris illius ex jucundis ejus; quis usquam scit aut scivit vestigium ullius Amoris, nisi ex jucundo et volupi ejus; jucunditates Amoris conjugialis in originibus suis sentiuntur ut beatitudines, faustitates et felicitates, ac in derivationibus ut amaenitates et voluptates, et in ultimis ut delitiae delitiarum. Est itaque origo amoris sexus, dum interiora mentis, et inde interiora corporis aperiuntur pro illarum jucunditatum influxu; at origo amoris conjugialis erat tunc, cum sphaera illius amoris primitiva, per coeptas desponsationes, idealiter promovit illas. Quod Virtutem seu potentiam illius amoris concernit, est illa ex permeabilitate illius amoris cum sua vena, a mente in corpus, mens enim est e capite in corpore dum sentit et agit, imprimis cum delitiatur ex hoc amore; nos inde judicamus gradus potentiae et constantias alternorum ejus. Insuper etiam Virtutem potentiae deducimus ex stirpe; si illa nobilis est apud patrem, fit etiam per traducem nobilis apud progeniem; quod nobilitas illa per traducem generetur, haereditetur et descendat, adstipulatur ratio cum experientia." His subscripta est Litera F. </p>
