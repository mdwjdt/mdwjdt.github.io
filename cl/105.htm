<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第105节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>105、之后，天使将手伸入银鼎，从里面取出第二张纸，从中读到内容如上：“我们隔间的同胞一致认为：婚姻之爱的源头和婚姻的源头是一样的。婚姻是法律规定的，以约束人对奸淫的天生欲望，免得它毁灭灵魂，毒害理性心智，败坏行为，并以疾病掏空身体。奸淫是野兽而非人的行为，是兽性，而非理性，是野蛮人的行径，非基督徒所为。婚姻之所以产生，是因为这类行为是危险的，婚姻之爱则与婚姻一同发展。这爱的活力或性能力也一样，它取决于弃绝任意淫乱的贞洁。原因在于，对只衷爱自己妻子的人来说，这种活力或性能力就限于一个女人，因此被收聚在一起，可以说集中起来。这便使它变得高尚，并通过剔除杂质使之成为精华，否则，它就会分散，流向四面八方。我们五人中有一位牧师还补充预定的观念，作为这种活力或性能力的一个原因，他说：‘婚姻不是预定的吗？既如此，由此而来的后代和生育他们的各种能力不也是预定的吗？’他认定这个原因，还为此发誓。”这张纸标注的字母是B（荷兰）。听到这话，有人以嘲弄的语气说：“预定论！好一个性无能的借口。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>105、此后天使又从缸儿中拿出一张纸，纸上写着如下的观点：</p><p>“我们认为婚姻之爱的来源与婚姻一样。婚姻被法律所限制，法律约束人们，避免奸情，因为它将损害灵魂，污染人的思想、侵害道德，给躯体带来疾病。奸情不应该存在人类身上，因为它是一种禽兽般的行为，不是理性的，不属于基督徒，而是一种野蛮的行为，摒弃它就是摒弃婚姻及婚姻之爱的基础。</p><p>“婚姻之爱的力量也一样。它依赖于贞洁的程度，也就是要抵制婚外情。只爱一个人，婚姻之爱是集中的。就像一种纯净物，污秽被清除了出去，否则纯净的也就不称其为纯净物。</p><p>“我们中有一个人是牧师，他补充一点说婚姻之爱的力量是生来注定的。他说“婚姻之爱不是注定的吗？若婚姻之爱是注定的，由婚姻而产生的一切也是注定的”这个人坚持这一观点，因为他这一观点是来自荷兰人的。</p><p>听到这有人说：“注定的，这可是性无能的好借口！”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #105 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>105. After this, the second time he put his hand into the urn, he took out of it a paper, from which he read the following.<p>'We, the representatives in our meeting, have agreed that the source of conjugial love is the same as that of marriage. This has been established by law in order to restrain human beings' inbred lust for adultery, which destroys their souls, poisons their rational minds, debases their behaviour, and blights their bodies with sickness. For adultery is the conduct of wild beasts, not human beings, of brutes, not rational beings, and so of barbarians, not Christians. Marriage grew up because such conduct was dangerous, and conjugial love developed together with it.<p>'It is much the same with the strength or potency of this love. This depends on chastity, which is abstaining from indiscriminate fornication. This is because the strength or potency in the case of a man who loves only his wife is restricted to one woman, and is therefore gathered together and, so to speak, concentrated. This ennobles it and makes it quintessential by removing the impurities, but it would otherwise be dispersed and scattered in all directions. One of us five who is a priest also brought in predestination as a cause of this strength or potency. "Are not marriages," he said, "predestined? And if they are, so is the begetting of children and the means which effect this." He insisted on this reason, because he had taken an oath on it.' This paper was signed with the letter B [for Holland].<p>On hearing this someone said in a mocking tone 'Predestination! That's a pretty excuse for inability or impotence.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #105 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>105. After this the angel reached his hand into the urn a second time, and taking out another piece of paper, he read from it the following opinion:<p>"We fellow countrymen in our group agreed that the origin of conjugial love is the same as the origin of marriage, which has been prescribed by law to restrain the inborn urges in people for adulterous relationships that destroy the soul, pollute the mind's reason, corrupt morals, and waste the body with disease. For adulterous relationships are not human but beastlike, not rational but animal, and thus not at all Christian but barbarian. A condemnation of such things led to the origination of marriage, and at the same time of conjugial love.<p>"It is similar with the vigor or potency of this love. It depends on chastity, which means abstaining from promiscuous and licentious relationships. The reason is that in one who makes love to his partner only, the vigor and potency is preserved for just that one person, and is thus collected and concentrated, so to speak, and then it becomes like a fine quintessence from which the impurities have been removed, a quintessence that would otherwise be dissipated and discharged every which way.<p>"One among the five of us, who is a priest, added also the idea of predestination as a reason for this vigor or potency, saying, 'Are marriages not predestined? And since these are predestined, so, too, are the offspring resulting from them and the varying abilities to beget them.' The man insisted on this as a cause because he had sworn himself to it."<p>This statement was signed below with the letter N.<p>On hearing it, someone said in a mocking tone, "Predestination! Oh, what a beautiful excuse for inability or impotence!" </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #105 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>105. After this he put his hand in the urn again and pulled out a paper from which he read this:<p>"We countrymen in our booth agree that the source of married love is the same as the source of marriages, which are ratified by law to restrain people's inborn yearning for adulteries that depress their spirits, pollute the thoughts in their minds, foul their morals, and destroy their bodies with infectious disease. For adulteries are not human but bestial, not rational but brutish and thus not Christian by any means, but barbarous. Marriages originated to condemn such things, and married love originated at the same time.<p>"The same goes for the vigor or potency of this love. It depends on chastity, which is abstinence from roving fornications.<p>The reason is that vigor or potency for those who love only one partner is reserved for one, so it is compressed and concentrated, and then it becomes noble, like a quintessence refined of the impurities that otherwise would disperse it and scatter it everywhere.<p>"One of us five, a priest, also suggested predestination as the cause of its vigor or potency, saying, 'Marriages are predestined, aren't they? And so is the reproduction in them, and the means to do it."' This was signed N.<p>Someone, when he heard this, said with a laugh, "Predestination!<p>Oh, what a lovely excuse for feebleness or impotence!" </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #105 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>105. The angel then put his hand into the urn a SECOND time and took from it a paper, from which he read as follows: "We compatriots in our compartment have agreed that the origin of conjugial love is the same as the origin of marriages. These have been sanctioned by laws for the restraining of the innate desire of men for adulteries, which ruin the soul, debase the reason of the mind, defile the morals, and consume the body with wasting disease; for adulteries are not human but bestial, not rational but brutish, thus in no way Christian but barbarian. It is for the condemnation of such practices that marriages arose and, at the same time, conjugial love. It is the same with the virtue or potency of that love, because this virtue depends upon chastity, and chastity is abstinence from roving whoredoms. The reason is, because with him who loves his partner alone, virtue or potency is reserved for one and so is gathered and concentrated, as it were. It then becomes like a noble quintessence purged of defilements, which otherwise would be dissipated and scattered in every direction. One of us five, who is a priest, adds also predestination as a cause of that virtue or potency, saying, "Are not marriages predestined? and granting this, are not the resultant prolifications and the efficacies thereto also predestined?" He insists on this as a cause because he has sworn to it" To this was subscribed the letter B. Hearing this, some one said in a mocking tone, "Predestination! Oh, what a fine apology for defect or impotence!" </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #105 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>105. Thereupon the angel thrust his hand into the urn a second time and drew out a paper from which he read as follows: "We compatriots in our booth have agreed that the origin of marital love is the same as the origin of marriages. Marriages have been sanctioned by law to restrain the innate human lusts for adulteries, which ruin the soul, debase the reason, defile the morals and waste the body with disease. For adulteries are not human but bestial, not rational but brutish, and thus not by any means Christian but barbarous. Marriages, and along with them marital love, arose in condemnation of such evils. The like applies to the vigor or potency of marital love, for potency depends upon chastity, which is abstinence from vagrant whoredoms. For with a man who loves only his married partner, vigor or potency is kept for one and thus is self-possessed and, as it were, concentrated; and then it becomes what we may call a noble quintessence, freed from defilements which otherwise would dissipate and scatter it in every direction. One of us five, who is a priest, adds predestination also as a cause of that vigor or potency, saying, 'Are not marriages predestined? If they are, any fruit from them and the power thereto are also predestined. He has insisted upon this cause, having sworn to it." To this was subscribed the letter B.<p>On hearing this some one said in a mocking tone, "Predestination! What a handsome justification for defect or impotence!" </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #105 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>105. Then the second time he put his hand into the urn and took from it a paper from which he read this: 'We compatriots in our apartment have agreed, that the origin of conjugial love is the same as the origin of marriages; which have been sanctioned by laws for the restraint of the innate concupiscences of men for adulteries, which ruin the soul, debase the reason of the mind, defile the morals, and consume the body with wasting disease. For adulteries are not human but bestial, not rational but brutish, and thus not by any means Christian but barbarous. The institution of marriages, and the rise at the same time of conjugial love, was for the condemnation of such evils. And so is it with the virtue or potency of this love, because it depends upon chastity, which is abstinence from roving scortations. The reason is that with him who loves only his married partner, the virtue or potency of his love is reserved for one, and so it is collected, and as it were concentrated; and then it becomes this noble, so to say, quintessence, abstracted from the defilements which otherwise would dissipate and scatter it in every direction. One of us five, who is a priest, adds also predestination as a cause of that virtue or potency, saying, Are not marriages predestinated? And with them, the prolifications from them and what renders efficient thereto is also predestinated.' He has insisted upon this cause because he had sworn to it.' To this was subscribed the letter B.<p>On hearing this someone said in a mocking tone, 'Predestination! O, what a beautiful apology for defect or impotence!' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #105 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>105. Post hoc, Secundo immisit manum in urnam, et desumpsit inde Chartam, ex qua legit haec. "Nos populares in nostro contubernio convenimus, quod origo Amoris conjugialis sit eadem cum origine Conjugiorum, quae per leges sancita sunt ad refraenandas concupiscentias hominibus connatas ad adulteria, quae pessumdant animas, inquinant rationes mentis, conspurcant mores, ac tabe conficiunt corpora; sunt enim Adulteria non humana sed ferina, non rationalia sed bruta, et sic prorsus non Christiana sed barbara; propter damnationem talium, est ortus Conjugiorum, et simul Amoris conjugialis. Simile est cum hujus Amoris virtute seu potentia, quod haec pendeat a castitate, quae est abstinentia a vagis scortationibus; causa est, quia Virtus seu Potentia apud illum, qui solam conjugem amat, est reservata uni, et sic collecta et sicut concentrata, et tunc fit illa nobilis sicut Quinta Essentia abstractis inquinamentis, quae alioquin dispergeretur et quaquaversum projiceretur. Unus inter nos quinque, qui Sacerdos, adjecit etiam Praedestinationem ut causam illius virtutis seu potentiae, dicens, 'suntne Conjugia praedestinata, et cum haec, etiam sunt inde Prolificationes, et ad has Efficaciae, praedestinatae;' institit in causam, quia juraverat in illam." His subscripta est litera B. His auditis quidam voce subridente dixit, "Praedestinatio, heu quam pulchra apologia defectus seu impotentiae." </p>
