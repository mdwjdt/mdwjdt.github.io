<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第67节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>67、由于属世之爱源于属灵之爱，属灵之爱源于属天之爱，因此说，婚姻之爱是一切属天、属灵之爱，以及由此而来的一切属世之爱的根基。属世之爱指的是爱自己和爱世界，而属灵之爱指的是爱邻舍，属天之爱指的是爱主。这就是这些爱之间的关系，因此它们所遵循并照之存在于人里面的次序是显而易见的。当以这样的次序被排列时，属世之爱从属灵之爱得其生命，属灵之爱从属天之爱得其生命，它们全都以这个次序从它们所出自的主得生命。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>67、因为自然的的爱来自于灵性的爱灵性的爱来自于天国的爱。所以我们说婚姻之爱是这三种爱的基础。</p><p>自然的爱是指对自己和对尘世的爱。灵性的爱与对他人的爱相关，而天国的爱与爱主有关。因为各种爱都有与其相联的东西，因而爱的结果及它如何体现在一个人身上是很明显的。如果爱按这种顺序存在的话。那么自然的将从灵性的爱那获得生命，灵性的爱将从天国的爱那儿获得生命。所有这些，按这种次序都是来自于主。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #67 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>67. Since natural loves spring from spiritual ones, and spiritual loves from celestial ones, we can say that conjugial love is the foundation of all spiritual and celestial loves, and consequently natural ones. Natural loves relate to self-love and love of the world; spiritual loves, however, to love towards the neighbour, and celestial loves to love to the Lord. This being the relationship between these loves, the order in which they follow, and in which they are present in a person, is obvious. When arranged in that order, natural loves derive their life from spiritual ones, spiritual loves from celestial ones, and so all in this sequence from their source, the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #67 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>67. Since natural loves spring from spiritual loves, and spiritual loves from celestial ones, therefore we say that conjugial love is the fundamental love of all celestial and spiritual loves, and so then of natural loves.<p>Natural loves are connected with loves of self and the world. Spiritual loves, on the other hand, are connected with love for the neighbor, and celestial loves are connected with love toward the Lord. And because loves have these connections, it is apparent what sequence they follow and in what order they are present in a person. When they are present in this order, then natural loves draw their life from spiritual loves, and spiritual loves from celestial ones, and all of them, in this order, from the Lord, from whom they come. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #67 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>67. Since earthly loves spring from spiritual loves and spiritual loves from heavenly ones, you can say that the love in marriage is the most basic of all heavenly and spiritual loves, and so it is the most basic of all earthly loves, too. Earthly loves have to do with self - love and worldly loves, spiritual loves have to do with love toward one's neighbor, and heavenly ones have to do with love for the Lord. And since the loves are in this relationship, the order they follow in, and are in for people, is obvious. When they are in this order, then earthly loves obtain their life from spiritual loves and spiritual loves from heavenly ones. And all are in this order from the Lord, whom they come from. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #67 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>67. Since natural loves emanate from spiritual loves, and spiritual loves from celestial, therefore it is said that conjugial love is the fundamental of all celestial and spiritual loves, and hence of all natural loves. Natural loves have reference to the loves of self and the world, while spiritual loves have reference to love towards the neighbor, and celestial loves, to love to the Lord. Such being the relationship of these loves, the order of their sequence and the order in which they are inwardly present with man, is clear. When present in this order, then the natural loves live from the spiritual, and these from the celestial, and in this order they all live from the Lord from whom they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #67 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>67. Because natural loves flow from spiritual, and spiritual from celestial, we say that marital love is fundamental not only among all celestial and spiritual loves, but also among natural loves thence. Natural loves mean loves of self and the world, spiritual loves mean love of the neighbor, and celestial loves love for the Lord. In view of these interconnections among loves, it is evident in what order they come and in what order they are present in the human being. When they are in their due order, then natural loves live from spiritual, and these from the celestial, and all from the Lord, from whom they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #67 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>67. Since natural loves flow forth from spiritual loves, and spiritual from celestial, for this reason it is said that conjugial love is the fundamental of all loves, celestial and spiritual, and thence of all natural loves. Natural loves have relation to the loves of self and of the world; but spiritual loves have relation to love towards the neighbor; and celestial loves have relation to love to the Lord. And such being the relation of these loves it is plain in what order they follow, and in what order they are in man. When they are in this order, the natural loves live from the spiritual, these from the celestial, and all in this order from the Lord from whom they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #67 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>67. Quoniam Amores naturales profluunt ex amoribus spiritualibus, et spirituales ex coelestibus, ideo dicitur quod Amor conjugialis sit fundamentalis omnium amorum coelestium et spiritualium, et inde naturalium. Amores naturales se referunt ad Amores sui et Mundi; amores autem spirituales se referunt ad Amorem erga proximum; et amores coelestes se referunt ad Amorem in Dominum; et quia tales amorum relationes sunt, patet in quo ordine sequuntur, et in quo insunt apud hominem; quando eo ordine insunt, tunc amores naturales vivunt ex spiritualibus, et hi ex coelestibus, et omnes in hoc ordine a Domino, a quo sunt. </p>
