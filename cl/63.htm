<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第63节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>63、至于主如何在一对夫妻身上形成一个教会，并通过该教会形成婚姻之爱，我们将在上面所提到的那一节予以说明。在此仅说明主在男人里面形成该教会，并通过这个男人在妻子里面形成它就足以了。教会在这二者里面形成后，就完全建成了。因为这时，良善与真理完全结合在一起，而良善与真理的结合就是教会。我将通过接下来的一系列论证证实：结合的倾向，也就是婚姻之爱，和形成教会的良善与真理的结合程度成正比。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>63、下面我们说一下主在男人中形成一个教会，通过男人在他的妻子中形成一个教会。这两个教会都形成后，整个教会才完成。因为此时真正的善和真理才真正完整地结合在一起。善和真理的结合才是真正的教会。以下几章将逐渐证明这种相互结合的倾向，也就是婚姻之爱，它像善和真理相结合一样地存在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #63 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>63. It will be shown in the section mentioned above how the Lord forms a church with a married couple, and by means of this forms conjugial love. Here I shall only say that the church is formed by the Lord with the man, and with the wife by means of the man. When the church is formed with both, it is fully made; for then there is a full linking of good with truth, and the linking of these makes the church. It will be demonstrated by the arguments which follow in sequence that the tendency to union, which is conjugial love, is proportionate to the linking of good and truth, which makes the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #63 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>63. However, the way in which the church is formed by the Lord in two married partners, and through it conjugial love - this will be clarified in the chapter indicated above. Here we will say only that the church is formed by the Lord in the man, and through the man in his wife. And after it has been formed in the two together, the church is complete, for then a full conjunction of good and truth takes place, and the conjunction of good and truth is the church. It will be progressively established with demonstrative proofs in the following chapters that the inclination to conjunction, which conjugial love is, exists in the same degree as the conjunction of good and truth, which is the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #63 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>63. However, the chapter mentioned above will clarify how the Lord forms a church for two married partners and through it forms married love. Here I just mention that the Lord makes a church for the man and through the man for the wife, and when it is complete for both of them it is a complete church. For the conjunction of good and truth becomes complete at that time, and the conjunction of good and truth is a church. Later, in its place, I will show by a descriptive line of reasoning that the inclination to join together that is married love is in proportion to the conjunction of good and truth that is the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #63 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>63. As to how the Church, and thereby conjugial love, is formed by the Lord with two married partners, this shall be illustrated in the chapter above referred to. Suffice it to say here that the Church is formed by the Lord with the man and through the man with the wife; and that when it is formed with both, it is a full Church for there is then a full conjunction of good and truth, and the conjunction of good and truth is the Church. That the conjunctive inclination, which is conjugial love, is present in the same degree as the conjunction of good and truth, which is the Church, will be confirmed by demonstrative arguments in what follows in this series. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #63 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>63. How the Church, and by it marital love, are formed by the Lord with two partners, however, shall be told in the chapter to which reference was made just above; here only let it be said that the Church is formed by the Lord with the husband, and through the husband with the wife; and after it has been formed with both, it is a full Church; for then there is a full conjunction of good and truth, and the conjunction of these two is the Church. It will be shown in what follows in a series of propositions to be demonstrated, that the conjunctive inclination, which is marital love, is present in the same measure as the conjunction of good and truth, which is the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #63 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>63. And in the chapter referred to above it will be illustrated how the church, and thereby conjugial love, is formed by the Lord with two married partners. Here, only, that the church is formed by the Lord with the man and through the man with the wife; and that after it is formed in both it is a full church, for then there is full conjunction of good and truth, and the conjunction of good and truth is the church. It will be established in series hereafter, by demonstrative arguments, that the conjunctive inclination, which is conjugial love, is in like degree with the conjunction of good and truth, which is the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #63 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>63. Quomodo autem Ecclesia a Domino apud duos conjuges formatur, et per illam Amor conjugialis, in Paragrapho, de quo supra, illustrabitur: hic solum quod Ecclesia a Domino formetur apud Virum, et per Virum apud Uxorem, et quod postquam apud utrumque formata est, Ecclesia plena sit; fit enim tunc plena conjunctio boni et veri, et conjunctio boni et veri est Ecclesia. Quod Inclinatio conjunctiva, quae est Amor conjugialis, sit in simili gradu cum Conjunctione boni et veri, quae est Ecclesia, argumentis demonstrativis in sequentibus in serie confirmabitur. </p>
