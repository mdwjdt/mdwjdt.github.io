<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第91节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>91、从女性的情感、兴趣、举止和形体明显看出来，她因丈夫的理智而注定成为意愿的产物；换句话说，成为对丈夫里面智慧的爱，因为她是通过丈夫的智慧形成的（对此，参看88，89节）。这一点可从女性的情感看出来，女性的情感是一种爱慕丈夫里面而非她自己里面的知识、聪明和智慧，因而爱慕她丈夫的情感。男人被爱不仅仅是因为使他看似人的形体，还因为他里面使他成为人的品质。这一点可从女性的兴趣看出来，女性的兴趣涉及被称为缝纫和刺绣的手工艺品，换句话说，就是用来装饰、打扮、增添自己美丽的东西，以及各种家务职责，以补足男人的职责，也就是我所说的公共事务。女人出于对婚姻的倾向而具有这些兴趣，她们渴望成为妻子，从而与她们的丈夫合而为一。这个结论也可从举止和形体得出，这是显而易见的，无需解释。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>91、相对比，女性生来是更注重意愿。这种意愿与男性的注重才智相呼应。换句话说，女性生来是衷爱男性的智慧，因为女性由男性智慧而来（见88、89）。这些可以从女性的性格、职业、行为及体态表现出来。</p><p>关于女性的性格、女性喜欢知识、才智，并因此而爱男性。男性不仅因为他的体格，容貌而可爱，而要看他基于他的才华。</p><p>关于女性的职业，它们更多的与手工工作象缝纫，绣花等装饰性工作有关，使得自身更完美。另外，女性作家务这是对男性的工作是种支持。女性所从事的活动使她们将来成为好的妻子，是婚姻的准备性工作。</p><p>关于女性行为及体态，众所周知，这里不做更多解释。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #91 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>91. It can also be shown from the affection, interest, behaviour and form of the woman that she is destined by birth to be a creature of the will as the result of her husband's intellect; in other words, to be the love of her husband's wisdom, since she acquires her form by means of his wisdom (<a href="88.htm">88-89</a> above). This can be shown from the woman's affection being the affection for loving knowledge, intelligence and wisdom, not, however, in herself, but in her husband, and so loving her husband. A man cannot be loved for his form alone, which makes him look human, but for the qualities in him which make him human. It may be shown from her interest, which is directed towards the handicrafts known as sewing and embroidery, in other words, what serves as ornament, and towards her own adornment and the enhancement of her own beauty; as well as towards the various domestic duties, which complement the duties of men, which, as I said, are called public. These interests are the result of a tendency towards marriage, a desire to become wives and so to be one with their husbands. It is obvious without explanation that the same conclusions can be drawn from behaviour and form. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #91 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>91. In contrast, the female is born to be will-oriented, but will-oriented in response to the intellectual orientation of the male, or in other words, to be a lover of the wisdom in a man, because she was formed by means of his wisdom (regarding which, see above, nos. <a href="88.htm">88</a>, <a href="89.htm">89</a>). This can also be seen from the disposition of the female, her employment, her behavior, and her figure.<p>With respect to the disposition of the female, it can be seen that it is a disposition to love knowledge, intelligence and wisdom - though not in herself but in a man - and for that reason to love a man. For a man is not lovable simply on account of his physique, the fact that he looks like a man, but on account of the gifts he has in him which make him human.<p>With respect to the employment of the female, it can be seen that it has to do with things that are works of the hands and are called sewing, needlework, and other names, which serve for decoration, for her personal adornment, and for enhancing her beauty. Also, that it has to do as well with various tasks called domestic, which complement the tasks of men (which, as we said, are called occupational). Women do these things out of an inclination towards marriage, in order to become wives and so one with their husbands.<p>With respect to the behavior and figure of the female, it is evident without explanation that the same thing is visible from these. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #91 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>91. By the same token, a woman is born to be willing in response to a man's intellect or, in other words, to be the love of a man's wisdom because she is formed by his wisdom. (More about this appears above, nos. <a href="88.htm">88-89</a>.) This, too, can be demonstrated from her motivation, the way she applies herself, her manner, and her figure.<p>A woman's motivation is an inclination to love knowledge, learning, and wisdom - not in herself but in a man - and thus to love him. For you cannot love a man just for a figure that seems human, but for the endowment that makes him human.<p>A woman applies herself to things done by hand called sewing, embroidery, and so forth, for clothing, beautifying herself, and increasing her attractiveness. She also applies herself to the various jobs known as domestic that are attached to men's jobs, called, again, jobs of the market. Women get this from an inclination to join together, be wives, and in this way be one with their husbands.<p>In her manner and figure it shows clearly without being explained. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #91 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>91. That the female is born to be voluntary--but voluntary from the intellectual of the man--or, what is the same thing, that she is born to be the love of man's wisdom, having been formed through his wisdom (see above, nos. <a href="88.htm">88, 89</a>), is evident from the affection of the female, from her application, her ways, and her form. FROM THE AFFECTION OF THE FEMALE, in that it is an affection of loving science, intelligence, and wisdom, yet, not in herself but in the man, and so of loving the man; for a man cannot be loved from his form alone just because this appears as a man, but only from the endowment which is in him and which makes him a man. FROM HER APPLICATION, in that it is to such works as are done with the hands, called knitting, embroidery, and by other names, and which serve for ornament and for the adornment of her person and the enhancement of her beauty; also to various offices which are called domestic and which adjoin themselves to the offices of men, which, as said above [n. <a href="90.htm">90</a>], are called forensic. Women apply themselves to these from an inclination to marriage, that they may become wives and so be one with their husbands. That it is apparent FROM HER WAYS AND HER FORM is clear without explanation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #91 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>91. Woman, on the other hand, is born to be volitional from the understanding of the man, or what is the same, to be the love of man's wisdom, because she was formed through his wisdom (on this see above, n. <a href="88.htm">88-89</a>). In turn this is evident from woman's affection, activity, ways and figure. From her affection: this is an affection for loving knowledge, intelligence and wisdom, yet not in herself, but in man, and so of loving the man, for a man cannot be loved just for his semblance or because he appears like a man, but for the endowments which make him a man. From woman's activity: she engages in such things as handwork, like knitting, embroidery, and so on, serving for adornment to decorate herself and heighten her beauty; and also in various domestic duties, which supplement the man's duties, which, as we have said, are outside the home. Women pursue these activities from an inclination to marriage, to become wives and thus one with their husbands. It needs no words to show that this is evident also from feminine ways and figure. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #91 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>91. On the other hand, that the female is born to be volitional, but volitional from the intellectual of the man, or what is the same, that she is to be the love of man's wisdom, because she was formed through his wisdom, of which see n. 88, 89 above. This too is evident from the affection of the female, from her application, from her manners, and from her form. From the Affection of the female, in that it is an affection for loving knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, and yet not in herself but in the man, and so for loving the man. For the man cannot be loved solely on account of his form, because he appears as a man, but on account of the endowment that is in him which makes him a man: From her Application, in that it is to such works as are done with the hands, called netting, embroidery, and by other names, which are of service for ornament, and for the adornment of her person and the enhancement of her beauty; and besides this to the various duties which are called domestic, and adjoin themselves to the duties of the men, which, as was said, are called out-of-door occupations. Women apply themselves to these uses from an inclination to marriage, that they may become wives and so be one with their husbands: That it appears also from her Manners and Form is clear without explanation. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #91 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>91. Quod autem Foemina nascatur ut sit voluntaria, sed voluntaria ex intellectuali viri, seu quod idem, ut sit amor sapientiae viri, quia per sapientiam ejus formata est, de quo videatur supra n: 88, 89, constare etiam potest ex Foeminae Affectione, ejus Applicatione, ejus Moribus, et ex ejus Forma. Ex Foeminae Affectione, quod sit affectio amandi scientiam, intelligentiam et sapientiam, attamen non in se sed in viro, et sic virum; non enim potest amari vir ex sola forma, quod appareat sicut homo, sed ex dote quae in illo est, quae facit ut sit homo. Ex ejus Applicatione, quod sit ad talia, quae sunt opera manuum, et vocantur neta, acupicta, et alio nomine, inservientia ad ornatus, et ad decorandum se, et ad exaltandum pulchritudinem suam: et insuper ad varia officia quae vocantur domestica, quae adjungunt se officiis virorum, quae, ut dictum est, vocantur forensia; haec sunt illis ex inclinatione ad Conjugium, ut fiant uxores, et sic unum cum maritis. Quod id etiam appareat ex Moribus, et Forma, absque explicatione patet. </p>
