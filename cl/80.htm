<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第80节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>80、记事六：<br><br>说完这番话，我朝西方的边界望去，看哪，那里出现仿佛烧着硫磺的火湖。我问天使：“地狱看上去为何这样？”天使回答说：“它们看似湖是由于对真理的歪曲，水的灵义是真理；湖周边和里面的火是由于对邪恶的爱欲，而硫磺则是由于对虚假的爱欲。湖、火、硫磺这三样都是表象，它们对应那里的人所陷入的恶爱。凡在那里的人都被永远关在劳改营里，为衣服、食物和床铺而劳碌；一旦作恶，就会受到严厉而痛苦的惩罚。”<br><br>我又问天使：“为何将那里的人称为属灵和属世的奸淫者，而不是罪人和无信的人？”天使回答说：“凡视奸淫为无物，也就是说，因坚信它们不是罪而故意犯下淫行的人，内心里都是罪人和无信的人。人类婚姻的准则和宗教信仰是齐头并进的；偏离或朝向宗教信仰的每一步、每一次改变，也是偏离或朝向婚姻准则的每一步、每一次改变，婚姻准则是基督徒所特有的品质。”我问“这婚姻的准则是什么？”他说：“婚姻准则就是唯独与一位妻子共同生活的渴望，基督徒越具有这种渴望，就越具有宗教信仰。”<br><br>此后，我的灵为这婚姻感到极其哀伤，它在远古时期本是最神圣的，如今却彻底堕落为邪淫。天使说：“今天的宗教何尝不是这样？主说：在世代的末了，但以理所那毁坏可憎的事必发生；那时，必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难（马太福音24:15，21）。毁坏可憎的事表示歪曲并除去一切真理；大灾难表示教会被邪恶与虚假攻击时的状态；这些事所论及的世代末了，表示教会的末期或结局。现在就是结局，因为所存的真理没有不被歪曲的；对真理的歪曲就是属灵的淫行，属灵的淫行与属世的淫行行如一体，因为它们也是合而为一的。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>80、 第六点</p><p>听到天使这么说，我向西方看了看，真的是一片火海和硫磺石，我问天使为什么这里的地狱呈现出这种样子。</p><p>他回答说：“地狱呈现为湖的样子是因为他们对真理的扭曲。因为水在精神的角度上象征着真理。湖周围好象有火，是因为他们钟爱罪恶，它看上去象是硫磺是因为它们钟爱谬误。湖、火和硫磺石这三种形象象征着煽动着那里的人的对罪恶的爱。</p><p>“那里的人都被锁在工房中工作，他们出苦力来换衣食及住的地方，他们若行恶，就会被严厉地惩罚。”</p><p>我又问天使：“你为什么说那的人是精神上或事实上的奸夫淫妇？为什么不说他们是行恶的人和无宗教信仰的人呢？”</p><p>天使回答说：“是因为那里的人不认为通奸是罪恶的，他们会做故意地那样做。人类对婚姻的倾向是与宗教紧密相联的。每向宗教靠近或偏离一小步都是向基督徒所特有的婚姻倾向的靠近或偏离。”</p><p>我问什么是婚姻倾向。天使回答说：“是一种只与一个妻子一起生活。基督徒只要有宗教信仰就有这种愿望。”</p><p>我不禁为极为神圣的婚姻变成一种通奸的关系而感到悲哀。</p><p>天使又说：“如今的宗教也是如此。主曾说在末日时会就会有象《但以理书》9:27，11:31，12:11中所说一片荒凉，会有象世界之初时的一片混乱。（《马太福音》24:15、21）</p><p>“一片荒凉象征着真理的完全丧失。一片混乱象征着教会处于罪恶和谬误的状态中。世界之末象征着教会的末日。”</p><p>“末日已经到了，因为没有没被扭曲了的真理。对真理的扭曲就是精神上的放荡，这与事实上的放荡同时存在。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #80 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>80. The sixth experience.<p>After this had been said I looked towards the border of the west, and there I saw lakes of fire and brimstone. 'Why,' I asked the angel, 'do the hells there appear in such a form?'<p>'They look,' he said, 'like lakes because of the falsifications of truth, water being in the spiritual sense truth. The appearance of fire around and in them results from the love of evil, the appearance of brimstone from the love of falsity. These three, lake, fire and brimstone, are appearances corresponding to the wicked loves of those there. All of them are shut up for ever in labour-camps, where they work for food, clothing and bed. When they commit crimes, they suffer severe and grievous punishments.'</p><p>[2] I asked the angel another question. 'Why did you say that the people there are spiritual and natural adulterers? Why not criminals and unbelievers?' 'Because,' he replied, 'all who think nothing of committing adultery, all, that is, who commit these acts in the firm belief that they are not sins and with deliberate purpose, are at heart criminals and unbelievers. For the principles of human marriage and religion go hand in hand; every pace and every step away from or towards religion is also a pace and a step away from or towards the principles of marriage, which is the special quality belonging to a Christian.'<p>When I asked, 'What is this principle of marriage?' he said, 'A desire to live with a single wife, a desire a Christian has the more, the more religious he is.'</p><p>[3] After this I felt very sad in spirit that marriages, which had been most holy in ancient times, were so corrupted and changed into adulteries. 'It is the same,' said the angel, 'with religion today. For the Lord says that at the ending of the age the abomination of desolation foretold by Daniel will take place; and there will be great affliction such as there has never been since the beginning of the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>). The abomination of desolation means the falsification and removal of all truth; affliction means the state of the church when it is attacked by evils and falsities. The ending of the age, about which these things are said, means the final period or end of the church. The end is now, since there is no truth left which has not been falsified; and the falsification of truth is spiritual licentiousness, which goes so closely with natural licentiousness that they make one.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #80 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>80. The sixth account:<p>When the angel said this, I looked over at the western horizon, and behold, I saw what appeared to be lakes of fire and brimstone. So I asked the angel why the hells there had this appearance.<p>He replied, "They appear as lakes on account of the falsifications of truth there, because water spiritually interpreted is truth. What looks like fire appears around them and in them as a result of their love of evil; and what looks like brimstone, because of their love of falsity. These three appearances - lake, fire and brimstone - so appear because they correspond to the evil loves which motivate the people.<p>"The people there are all shut up in eternal workhouses, and they labor in exchange for food, clothing and a bed. And whenever they do evil, they are severely and miserably punished."</p><p>[2] Again I asked the angel, "Why did you say that the people there are adulterers both spiritually and naturally? Why not say that they are evildoers and irreligious?"<p>"Because," he replied, "all people who regard adulterous affairs as nothing, that is, who believe they are not sins and who commit them deliberately and so purposefully, at heart are evildoers and irreligious. For the human inclination towards marriage goes hand in hand with religion at every step. Every little step and every stride away from religion or towards religion is also a step or stride away from or towards the conjugial inclination that is peculiar and proper to a Christian person."<p>At my asking what that conjugial inclination was, he said, "It is a wish to live with only one wife, and a Christian person has this wish to the extent that he has religion."</p><p>[3] I afterwards grieved in spirit that marriage - which in ancient times was so sacred - had so wantonly been transformed into adulterous relationships.<p>And the angel said, "It is the same with religion today. For the Lord says that at the end of the age there will be the abomination of desolation foretold by Daniel, <sup >1</sup>and that 'there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>).<p>"The abomination of desolation symbolizes the falsification and loss of all truth. Tribulation symbolizes the state of the church infested by evils and falsities. And the end of the age, of which these things are said, symbolizes the final period or end of the church.<p>"The end has now come, because no truth remains that has not been falsified, and falsification of truth is spiritual licentiousness, which allies itself with natural licentiousness, because they go together."<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_11_31.htm">11:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_12_11.htm">12:11</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #80 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>80. The sixth story: When he said this I looked toward the western border and sure enough it looked like lakes of fire and brimstone, and I asked the angel, "Why do the hells there look like that?"<p>He said, "They look like lakes because of distortions of the truth, because water in spiritual terms is truth. It seems like fire around them and in them due to love of evil, and like brimstone due to love of untruth. These three - the swamp, the fire, and the brimstone - are just outward appearances, since they are the correspondences of evil loves that the people have. Every one confined there is an inmate forever, and they work for their food, clothing, and bed. And when they do something evil they get a severe and miserable punishment."<p>I asked the angel something else. "Why did you say that the people there are spiritual and natural adulterers? Why not evildoers and ungodly people?"<p>"Because," he answered, "everyone who thinks adulteries are nothing, that is, who believes in them and does them from conviction, which means from an assumption that they are not sins, is at heart an evildoer and ungodly. For a human, married love and religion walk together in step. Every footstep and every stride made in religion and into religion is also a footstep and stride for the married love, and toward the married love, that is special and appropriate to a Christian person."<p>To the question, "What married love is that?" he said, "It is a desire to live with just one wife, and a Christian person has this desire according to his religion."<p>Afterwards it pained my spirit that the marriages that were so very holy in the ancient ages had been so recklessly turned into adulteries.<p>The angel said, "It's the same with religion today, for the Lord said that in the consummation of the age will be 'the abomination of desolation predicted by Daniel,' and 'there will be great affliction like nothing that has been from the beginning of the world' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>).<p>"'Abomination of desolation' means all truth turning to untruth and being taken away. 'Affliction' refers to the condition of the church infested with evils and false concepts. And the 'consummation of the age' that it says these things about means the last period of a church, or its end.<p>"The end is now! Because no truth is left unfalsified. And turning truth into lies is spiritual fornication, which interacts with worldly fornication, because they are related." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #80 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>80. The Sixth Memorable Relation:<p>When these words had been spoken, I looked to the border of the west and behold, there appeared pools as though of fire and brimstone, and I asked the angel, "Why do the hells there appear like that?"<p>He answered: "They appear as pools from their falsifications of truth, water in the spiritual sense being truth; and fire, as it were, appears around and within them, from the love of evil, and brimstone from the love of what is false. These three, the pool, fire, and brimstone, are appearances because they are correspondences of the evil loves in which they are. All who are there are shut up in eternal workhouses where they labor for food, clothing, and bed; and when they do evil, they are severely and miserably punished."</p><p>[2] I further asked the angel, "Why did you say that in that place are spiritual and natural adulterers? Why not say evil doers and the impious?" He answered, "Because all who repute adulteries as nothing, that is, who believe from confirmation that they are not sins and so commit them of set purpose, are at heart evil doers and impious; for the human conjugial and religion go together in even pace. Every step and every move made from religion and into religion is also a step and a move made from the conjugial which is peculiar and proper to the Christian, and into the conjugial."<p>To the question, "What is that conjugial?" he said, "It is the desire to live with one wife alone; and a Christian has this desire according to his religion."</p><p>[3] After this I grieved in spirit that marriages, which in the ancient Ages had been most holy, are so hopelessly changed into adulteries. And the angel said: "It is the same at this day with religion; for the Lord says:<p>In the consummation of the age there shall be the abomination of desolation foretold by Daniel. And there shall be great affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>.<p>The abomination of desolation signifies the falsification and deprivation of all truth; affliction signifies the state of the Church infested by evils and falses; and the consummation of the age, of which these words are spoken, signifies the last time or end of the Church. The end is now; for there is no truth left which has not been falsified, and falsification of truth is spiritual whoredom which acts as one with natural whoredom because they cleave together." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #80 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>80. VI. At those words, I looked to the far west, and behold! There appeared as it were lakes of fire and brimstone. I asked the angel, - Why do the hells in that quarter have this appearance? -<p>He answered, - They appear like lakes from falsifications of truth; water in the spiritual sense is truth. The likeness of fire appears around and in them from love of evil; and of brimstone from love of the false. These three, lake, fire, and brimstone, are appearances, being correspondences of the evil loves in which those hells are. The inhabitants are locked up in eternal workhouses, where they labor for food, clothing and lodging. When they do evil, they are severely and miserably punished. -</p><p>[2] Again I asked the angel, - Why did you say that the people in this place are spiritual and natural adulterers? Why not say evil doers and impious? -<p>He replied, - Because all who consider adulteries nothing, that is, believe from confirmation that they are not sins, and therefore do them deliberately, are at heart evil doers and impious. For the human marital and religion take every step together. Every advance and every step from religion and toward religion is also an advance and step by and toward the marital which belongs to the Christian man and is peculiar to him. -<p>To the question, - What is this - marital - ? - he said, - It is the desire of living with one wife only. The Christian has this desire as he has religion. -</p><p>[3] Afterwards I grieved in spirit that marriages, in ancient ages so very holy, had been so wretchedly changed into adulteries.<p>And the angel said, - It is the same with religion at the present day; for the Lord says:-<p>In the consummation of the age there shall be the abomination of desolation foretold by Daniel. And there shall be great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>)<p>- The abomination of desolation - signifies falsification and derivation of all truth; - affliction - signifies the state of the Church infested by evils and falsities; and - the consummation of the age, - of which these things are predicated, signifies the lat time or end of the Church. The end is now; for no truth is left which has not been falsified; and falsification of truth is spiritual whoredom, which acts as one with natural whoredom; they cling together. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #80 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>80. The Sixth Relation:<p>As these words were said, I was looking to the extreme west, and behold! there appeared as it were lakes of fire and brimstone. And I asked the angel, 'Why have the hells there such. an appearance?'<p>He answered, 'They appear as lakes from their falsifications of truth; because water in the spiritual sense is truth. And there appears the likeness of fire round about them and in them, from their love of evil; and of brimstone from their love of the false. These three, the lake, the fire, and the brimstone are appearances, because they are the correspondences of the evil loves in which they are. All these are shut up in eternal workhouses, where they labor for their food, their clothing, and their bed. And when they do evil they are severely and miserably punished.'<p>Again I asked the angel, 'Why did you say that those who are there are spiritual and natural adulterers? Why not say evil doers and impious?'<p>He replied, 'Because all who regard adulteries as nothing, that is, who believe from confirmation that they are not sins, and so do them of set purpose, are evil doers and impious in their heart. For the human conjugial and religion go together at every step. Every advance and every step from religion and into religion is also an advance and step from the conjugial and into the conjugial that belongs to and is peculiar to the Christian man.'<p>To the question, 'What is this conjugial?' he said, 'It is the desire of living with one only wife. And the Christian man has this desire according to his religion.'<p>Afterwards I was grieved in spirit that marriages, which in the ancient ages were most holy, are so wretchedly changed into adulteries.<p>And the angel said, 'It is the same with religion at the present day; for the Lord says:<p>In the consummation of the age there shall be the abomination of desolation foretold by Daniel.

The end is now; because there is no truth left that is not falsified; and falsification of truth is spiritual scortation, which acts as one with natural scortation, for they cohere.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #80 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>80. Sextum Memorabile: Cum haec dicta sunt, spectavi ad finem Occidentis, et ecce apparuerunt sicut Stagna ignis et sulphuris, et quaesivi Angelum, "cur apparent Inferna ibi talia;" respondit, "apparent sicut Stagna ex falsificationibus veri, quia aqua in sensu spirituali est verum; et apparet sicut ignis circum illa et in illis ex amore mali, et sicut sulphur ex amore falsi; tria illa, Stagnum, Ignis et Sulphur, sunt apparentiae, quia sunt correspondentiae malorum amorum, in quibus sunt; sunt omnes ibi inclusi aeternis Ergastulis, et laborant pro victu, amictu et lecto; et dum malefaciunt, graviter et misere puniuntur."</p><p>[2] Iterum quaesivi Angelum, "cur dixisti, quod ibi sint spirituales et naturales adulteri; cur non, malefactores et impii;" respondit, "quia omnes illi qui, pro nihilo reputant adulteria, hoc est, qui credunt et faciunt illa ex confirmato et sic ex proposito quod peccata non sint, sunt corde suo malefactores et impii; Conjugiale enim humanum et Religio una vadunt in omni passu; omne vestigium et omnis gressus <sup>1</sup>ex Religione et in Religionem, est quoque vestigium et gressus a Conjugiali et in Conjugiale quod peculiare et proprium est homini Christiano:" ad interrogationem, quid Conjugiale illud, dixit, "est desiderium vivendi cum una sola Uxore, et hoc desiderium est homini Christiano secundum ejus Religionem."</p><p>[3] Postea indolui spiritu, quod Conjugia, quae in Antiquis Aevis sanctissima fuerant, tam perdite conversa sint in adulteria; et dixit Angelus, "simile est cum Religione hodie, nam dicit Dominus, Quod in Consummatione saeculi futura sit Abominatio desolationis praedicta a Daniele. Et quod futura sit Afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio Mundi. <sup>2</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_80/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_15" target=_top>Matth. 24:15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_80/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_21" target=_top>21</a>. Abominatio desolationis <sup>3</sup>significat falsificationem et deprivationem omnis veri; Afflictio significat statum Ecclesiae infestatum a malis et falsis; et Consummatio saeculi, de quo illa dicta sunt, significat ultimum tempus seu finem Ecclesiae; est nunc finis, quia non superest verum, quod non falsificatum est, ac falsificatio veri est scortatio spiritualis, quae unum agit cum scortatione naturali, quia cohaerent."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: gressius<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: Mundo.<br><br>3.&nbsp;Prima editio: desolationis, </p>
