<h4 align="center"></h4><p>519、圣言被基督教会中那些玷污其良善与真理的人侵犯。侵犯圣言的，是那些将真理从良善，或良善从真理分离的人；以及那些把真理表象和谬误当作纯正真理，并确认它们的人；还有那些知道圣言所教导的真理，却过着邪恶生活的人，除此之外的其他这类人。对圣言和教会的这些侵犯就对应于《利未记》（18章）中所列举的禁令。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #519 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>519. The Word is violated by those in the Christian church who adulterate its good and its truths. They do this if they separate truth from good, and good from truth. Also, if they take appearances of truth and fallacies for real truths and confirm them. Also, if they know the truths taught from the Word, but live wicked lives; and others who behave in similar ways. These violations of the Word and the church correspond to the forbidden degrees listed in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_18_1.htm">Leviticus 18</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #519 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>519. Violation of the Word is committed by people in the Christian Church who adulterate its good and truths, and this is done by those who separate truth from good and good from truth. It is done as well by those who mistake appearances of truth and fallacies for genuine truths and defend them. And so, too, by those who know truths of doctrine from the Word and live evilly. Likewise by others of a similar character.<p>There is a correspondence between these violations of the Word and of the church and the forbidden classes of people enumerated in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_18_1.htm">Leviticus 18</a>. </p>

And those who separate truth from good and good from truth do this. So do the ones who take apparent truths, and falsities, for real truths and confirm them, and also people who know the truths of instruction from the Word and live evilly, and others like that. These violations of the Word and church correspond to the levels of adultery prohibited in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_18_1.htm">Leviticus 18</a>. </p>

These violations of the Word and the church correspond to the prohibited degrees enumerated in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_18_1.htm">Leviticus 18</a>. </p>

Violatio Verbi fit ab his, qui in Ecclesia Christiana adulterant bona et vera ejus, et illi hoc faciunt, qui separant verum a bono, et bonum a vero; tum qui apparentias veri et fallacias pro genuinis veris assumunt et confirmant; ut et, qui vera doctrinae ex Verbo sciunt, et male vivunt, praeter similes alios. Hae Violationes Verbi et Ecclesiae correspondent Gradibus prohibitis, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_519/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_18_1-30" target=_top>Levit. 18</a>. enumeratis. </p>
