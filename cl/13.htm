<h4 align="center"></h4><p>13、之后，天使对他们说：“还没到中午，请随我到我们君主的花园，它毗邻宫殿。”于是，他们就去了，在入口处，天使说：“请看这天堂社群里最瑰丽的花园！”但他们回应说：“你说什么？这里没有花园。我们只看见一棵树，树枝和枝头上好像挂着黄金果实和银树叶，叶子边缘饰有翡翠，树下面有小孩子和他们的保姆。”对此，天使深情地说：“这棵树在花园中央，我们称它为天堂之树，有人称之为生命树。不过，请靠近一点，你们的眼睛必被打开，也必看见这花园。”他们照做后，眼睛就开了。他们看见树上结满美味的果实，有葡萄藤缠绕其上，树的顶端被果实压弯，垂向中间的生命树。<br><br>这些树成行种植，向外延伸，不断形成圆或环，就像一个无尽的螺旋。这是一个完美的林木螺旋，其中的物种，一个接一个，照着果实的珍贵程度排列。螺旋的开端和当中的那棵树之间有相当大的空隙，这个空隙闪烁着光芒，使得树环从第一行到最后一行渐次发出光辉。第一行树是所有树种中最优质的，它们郁郁葱葱，结有最珍贵的果实。这些树被称为天堂之树，有些则从未见过，因为它们不存在、也不可能存在于尘世。其次是产油的树种，接着是产酒的树种，之后是散发香味的树种，最后是用来制成器具、适合做木料的树种。在环或螺旋状的树丛中，到处有座位，这些座位由伸出的树梢从后面交织形成，其果实则为点缀和装饰。在连绵不断的环状树丛中，有通向花园的大门，这些大门还通向被分成小块和苗圃的草坪。<br><br>天使的同伴看到这些，失声叫道：“看哪，这里能看见天堂！无论我们的目光转向何处，它们给我们的印象都是无法形容的天堂乐园。”天使听到这些赞叹很开心，说：“就其源头而言，我们天堂的所有花园都是象征天堂八福的可见形式或模型。因为所流入的八福提升了你们的心智，所以你们才会大叫：‘看哪，这里能看见天堂！’然而，未接受这流入者仅仅将这些乐园视为林区。凡热爱提供服务者都会接受这种流入，凡热爱荣耀而不是受服务激励者都不会接受它。”后来，他又解释和教导了花园中的每个细节所代表和象征的含义。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>13、（1）此时，天使对他们说：“还没到中午呢，跟我一起到王子的花园中。”于是他们就去了，在门口时，天使说：“看那，天国中最壮美的花园。”</p><p>但是他们回答说：“你在说什么？”这并不是个花园。我们只看到树、树枝上是金子做的果实，树叶好像是银子做成的，叶子周围装饰着翡翠。树下面是孩子及他们的保姆们。</p><p>此时天使说到：“这棵树是在花园的中心。我们称它为天堂之树，有些人叫它生命树。但是走近点儿，你们的双眼将会睁开，你们会看到花园。”</p><p>他们这样做了。他们看到结满甜美果实的树木，上面覆着枝叶繁茂的藤蔓。上面的果实朝着在中心的生命树摆动着。</p><p>（2）这些树在不同的时期被种下，就像一个四季长青，没有尽头的螺旋。如此完美果实，周而复始，连续不断。这一周期在中心的树那里开始，周围交错的空间被一缕缕光照亮，使得周围的树木从第一棵到最后一棵都在闪光。</p><p>第一棵树是它们中最优异的，结满了果实，被称为乐园之树。来访的人从没见过这种树，因为它们不能在世间自然之光中生长。接下来是果实用来榨油的树，其后是用来酿酒的树，之后是有香气的树木，最后是用来做木材的树木。</p><p>这儿或那儿，在树丛是有座位，由修剪过的树枝做成，以它们的果实做装饰。这些树从通向花园，从那里通向草坪。</p><p>（2）看到这些之后，随行的人说：“看啊，天国的景像！每当我们睁开眼睛，最有无法形容的景色涌入眼帘。”</p><p>听到这些，天使高兴地说：“天国中所有的花园，从本质上讲都代表着天国的祝福。因为你们的头脑被这些流入的祝福而提升，你会惊叹，看那，一个天国的典范！”但是没有得到流入的祝福的人只会看到阴森森的景像。另外，一切接受到祝福的人有一种对做有用的事的爱，且受到这种爱的鼓舞。受到荣耀鼓舞的人不会得到这种流入。</p><p>之后，天使向他们解释花园中的每件事物都代表什么。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #13 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>13. After this the angel said to them: 'It is not midday yet. Come with me into our prince's garden, which adjoins this palace.' So they went, and at the entrance he said: 'This is a magnificent garden, even compared with those in this heavenly community of ours.'<p>'What do you mean?' they answered, 'there is no garden here. We can see only one tree, with what looks like golden fruits on its branches and its top, and what look like leaves of silver, their edges decorated with emeralds; and under the tree there are children with their nurses.'<p>To this the angel replied with deep feeling in his voice: 'This tree is in the middle of the garden, and we call it the tree of our heaven; some call it the tree of life. But go on closer and your eyes will be opened, and you will see the garden.' They did so, and their eyes were opened, and they saw trees laden with tasty fruits, with grape-vines trained round them; and their tops with fruit on them nodded towards the tree of life in the middle.</p><p>[2] These trees were planted in an unbroken row, extending outward and running in constant circles or rings, like a never-ending spiral. It was a perfect spiral of trees, in which one species followed another arranged in order of the nobility of their fruits. There was a considerable gap between the beginning of the spiral and the tree in the middle, and this gap sparkled with gleams of light, which made the trees of the ring shine with a splendour running in graduated steps from the first to the last. The first trees were the most outstanding of all, luxuriant with the finest fruits; these were called trees of paradise, something never seen before, because they do not, nor can they, exist on earth in the natural world. These were followed by trees that yield oil, and these by trees that yield wine. After this came trees with a fragrant scent, and finally trees with wood useful for making things. Here and there in this spiral or ring of trees were seats shaped out of tree-shoots brought and woven together from behind, enriched and embellished with their fruits. There were gates in this unbroken circle of trees, leading to flower gardens, and these leading to lawns, divided into plots and beds.</p><p>[3] When the angel's companions saw these they cried; 'Here is heaven made visible! Whichever way we turn our gaze, there is an impression made on us of heavenly paradise, beyond description.' The angel was delighted to hear this, and said: 'All the gardens in our heaven are visible forms or models representing the varied blessedness of heaven in their origins. It was the influence of the varied blessedness which uplifted your minds and made you cry: "Here is heaven made visible!" Those, however, who do not receive that influence look upon these paradises as no more than woodland. It is all those who have a love for performing services who receive that inflow. Those who have a love for glory and are not motivated by service do not receive it.' Afterwards he set forth and instructed them what was the representation and meaning of each detail in that garden. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #13 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>13. After that the angel said to them, "It is not yet noon. Come with me to our prince's garden, adjacent to this palace."<p>So they went, and at the entrance he said, "Look, the most magnificent garden in this heavenly society!"<p>But they replied, "What do you mean? This is not a garden. We see only one tree, with what appear to be fruits of gold on its branches and at the top, and what seem to be leaves of silver, whose edges are adorned with emeralds. And under the tree we see children with their nursemaids."<p>At this the angel said with inspired voice, "This tree is in the middle of the garden. We call it the tree of our heaven, and some call it the tree of life. But go, get closer, and your eyes will be opened and you will see the garden."<p>So they did so. And their eyes were opened, and they saw trees loaded with flavorful fruits and covered with leafy vines, the tops of which swayed with their fruits towards the tree of life in the center.</p><p>[2] These trees had been planted in a continuous series which went out and around in perpetual circles or rings, in a seemingly endless spiral. It was a perfect spiral of trees, with one species following another in unbroken succession in the order of the excellence of their fruits. The beginning of the spiral started at a considerable distance from the tree in the middle, and the intervening space was lit up by a sparkling stream of light, which caused the trees in the spiral to shine with a successive and continued radiance from the first to the last of them.<p>The first trees were the most excellent of them all, abounding with rich fruits, and called trees of paradise, which the visitors had never seen because these trees do not and cannot exist in the lands of the natural world. After them came trees whose fruits are used in the production of oil. Next, trees whose fruits are used in making wine. Then trees marked by their fragrance. And finally timber trees whose wood is used in construction.<p>Here and there in this spiral or circular course of trees were places to sit, formed by the trained and interwoven branches of the trees behind them, and loaded and adorned with their fruits. This unending circle of trees had openings which led out into flower gardens, and from these to lawns, divided into areas and beds.</p><p>[3] Seeing all this, the companions of the angel exclaimed, "Look, a model of heaven! Wherever we turn the gaze of our eyes, some sight of a heavenly paradise comes flooding in that is beyond description!"<p>On hearing this the angel rejoiced and said, "All the gardens of our heaven are, in their origin, representative forms or images of heavenly blessings. And because your minds were elevated by the flowing in of these blessings, you cried out, 'Look, a model of heaven!' But people who do not receive that influx see these sights of paradise simply as woodsy scenes. Moreover, all people receive the influx who are motivated by a love of being useful. But people who are motivated by a love of glory, and this not for the sake of any useful purpose, do not receive it."<p>Afterwards the angel explained to them and taught them what each thing in the garden represented and symbolized. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #13 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>13. After this the angel said to them, "It's not noon yet. Come with me to our prince's garden by the palace." They went, and at the entrance he said, "Behold the most magnificent garden in this heavenly community!"<p>But they answered, "What are you saying? There's no garden here. All we see is one tree with fruit that looks gold on its branches and crown, and leaves like silver decorated at the edges with emeralds, and under the tree little children with their nurses."<p>At this the angel caught his breath and said, "This tree is in the middle of the garden, and we call it the tree of our heaven.<p>Some call it the tree of life. But go ahead and get closer. Your eyes will be opened, and you'll see the garden."<p>They did, and their eyes were opened, and they saw trees with plenty of tasty fruits, twined around with vine tendrils, their tops bending with fruit toward the tree of life in the middle.<p>These trees were planted in an unbroken row that went out and around in steady circles or spirals like an endless helix. It was a perfect helix of trees. Species after species followed one another according to the excellence of their fruits. The first sweep of the helix started at a considerable distance from the tree in the middle, and in the interval danced a sparkling of light, so the trees of the spiral gleamed with a steady, uninterrupted brightness from the first one to the last.<p>The first trees, called trees of paradise, were the finest of all, luxuriant with the plumpest fruits, and they have never been seen before, because they do not grow and cannot survive in the soil of the natural world. Next followed olive trees, then vine trees, then fragrant trees, and finally trees with good wood for woodwork.<p>Here and there in the helix or spiral of trees were seats made by training and interlacing the young branches of the trees behind the seats, and they were enriched and ornamented by their fruits.<p>In this perpetual cycle of trees were openings that led to flower gardens, and from there to lawns laid out in fields and terraces.<p>When the angel's party saw these they exclaimed, "Why, it's a model of heaven! Wherever we turn our eyes, in flows something heavenly and paradisal that defies description!"<p>The angel was glad to hear this. "All the gardens in our heaven are forms or images that represent heaven's blessings at their sources," he said, "and the influence of these blessings lifted up your minds, so you exclaimed, 'Why, it's a model of heaven!'" But people who do not receive that influence see these paradises as nothing but forests. Everyone who has a love of usefulness receives that influence, but people who are in love with fame - - and not because of usefulness - don't receive it." Then he explained and taught what the different things in the garden represented and stood for. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #13 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>13. After this, the angel said to them: "It is not yet noon; come with me into the garden of our prince, which is close by the palace." They went; and at the entrance he said: "Behold the most magnificent of all the gardens in this heavenly society." But they replied: "what are you saying? There is no garden here. We see only a single tree; and among its branches and on its top, fruits as though of gold, and leaves as though of silver, with their edges adorned with emeralds; and under the tree, little children with their nurses."<p>At this, the angel said with inspired voice: "This tree is in the center of the garden and is called by us the Tree of our Heaven, and by some the Tree of Life. But go farther in, draw near, and your eyes will be opened and you will see the garden." They did so; and, their eyes being opened, they saw trees entwined with the tendrils of vines and laden with delicious fruits; and the tree-tops with their fruit were bending towards the Tree of Life in the center.</p><p>[2] These trees were planted in an unbroken line which ran out and was extended into ever new circles or gyres after the manner of a perpetual helix. It was a perfect arboreal helix, wherein different species of trees followed each other in unbroken order according to the nobility of their fruits. The beginning of this great gyre was at a considerable distance from the Tree in the center; and the intervening space glittered with a stream of light from which the trees of the gyre shone with a splendor which was successive and continuous from the first trees to the last. The first trees, luxuriant with the choicest fruits, were the most excellent of all. They are called paradisal trees, and are never seen in any country of the natural world because they do not and cannot exist there. Next came trees of oil; after these, trees of wine; then trees of fragrance; and lastly, trees of wood useful for working. Here and there in this arboreal helix or gyre were seats, the backs of which were formed by the converging and intertwining of branches of trees, and were enriched and adorned by their fruits. In this perpetual circle of trees were gates which opened into flower gardens laid out in plots and beds, and from these into lawns.</p><p>[3] Seeing these things, the companions of the angel exclaimed: "Lo, heaven in form. Whithersoever we turn the sight of our eyes, some heavenly paradisal thing flows in, which is ineffable."<p>Rejoiced at hearing this, the angel said: "All the gardens in our heaven are representative forms or types of heavenly beatitudes in their origins; and it is because an influx of these states of blessedness uplifted your minds that you exclaimed, "Lo, heaven in form." Those who do not receive that influx view these paradisal things merely as forests. All who are in the love of uses receive the influx; but those do not receive it who are in the love of glory and not of use." For their instruction, he then explained what the several things in that garden represented and signified. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #13 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>13. Thereupon the angel said to them, "It is still not noon; come with me into our prince's garden at the side of the palace." They went; and at the entrance he said:<p>"Behold the most magnificent garden in this heavenly society."<p>They answered, "What did you say? There is no garden here. We see only one tree, fruit seemingly of gold on its branches and top, and leaves as of silver, their edges ornamented with emeralds, and under the tree little children with their nurses."<p>At this the angel said in an inspired tone, "This tree occupies the center of the garden, and we call it the tree of our heaven, some the tree of life. But proceed, go nearer, your eyes will be opened, and you will see the garden."<p>They did so; and their eyes were opened. They saw trees weighed down with delicious fruit and entwined with the tendrils of vines, their tops inclining with their fruit toward the tree of life in the center.</p><p>[2] The trees were arranged in an unbroken row, which extended in the recurring circles or gyres of what seemed to be an endless spiral. It was a perfect spiral of trees, arranged by kinds in the order of the excellence of their fruits. The spiral began at a little distance from the tree in the center. Across the intervening space a shaft of light shone on all the trees of the gyre from first to last in a graduated splendor. The first trees, called trees of paradise, were the finest of all, luxuriant with the choicest fruits, - they are not to be seen on any earth of the natural world and cannot exist there. Then came oil-trees; then wine-trees; then fragrant trees; and finally timber trees for building. Here and there in the unending spiral or gyre of trees were seats formed of the trained and interlaced boughs of the trees behind them, and enriched and adorned by their fruits. In it, too, passageways opened on flower-gardens and on the level stretches and sloping banks of lawns beyond.</p><p>[3] The companions of the angel cried out at the sight, "Behold, the very form of heaven! Wherever we turn our gaze, there flows in something ineffable of a heavenly paradise."<p>The angel rejoiced to hear this. "All our gardens," he said, "are in origin representative forms or types of heavenly beatitudes. It was because an influx of these beatitudes uplifted your minds that you exclaimed, 'Behold, the very form of heaven!' These paradises look like woods to those who do not receive an influx. All who are in the love of use receive an influx, but not those who love glory without loving use." Then he explained and taught them what the several objects in the garden represented and signified. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #13 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>13. After this the angel said to them, 'It is not yet noon, come with me into the garden of our prince adjacent to the palace.' They went; and at the entrance he said:<p>'Behold the most magnificent garden in this heavenly society.'<p>But they replied, 'What do you say? There is no garden here. We see only one tree; and among its branches and on its top fruit as if of gold, and leaves as of silver with their edges bedecked with emeralds, and under that tree little children with their nurses.'<p>To this with inspired voice the angel said, 'This tree is in the midst of the garden, and is called by us the tree of our heaven, and by some the tree of life. But go on, draw near, and your eyes will be opened, and you will see the garden.'<p>They did so; and their eyes were opened, and they saw trees filled with delicious fruits, twined about with the tendrils of vines, their tops bending with fruit towards the tree of life in the midst. The trees were set in a continuous series, which ran out and onwards in endless circlings or gyres as of a perpetual spiral. It was a perfect spiral of trees, wherein kind after kind followed in succession according to the nobility of their fruits. The beginning of this gyration was separated by a considerable space from the tree in the midst; and the intervening space gleamed with a blaze of light wherefrom the trees of the spiral glowed with a graduated and continuous splendor from the first to the last. The first trees were the most excellent of all, luxuriant with exquisite fruits, and were called trees of paradise, never seen, because they do not and cannot exist in any country of the natural world; next came olive trees; after these trees with vines; then fragrant trees and lastly trees whose wood is useful for timber. Here and there in this spiral or gyre of trees were seats formed by training and interlacing the young branches of the trees behind and enriched and adorned by their fruits. In this perpetual cycle of trees there were openings which led to gardens of flowers, and thence to lawns, laid out in beds and plots.<p>Seeing these things, the angel's attendants exclaimed, 'Lo! heaven in form! Whichever way we turn our eyes something heavenly, paradisal, flows in, which is ineffable.'<p>The angel rejoiced at hearing this, and said, 'The gardens in our heaven are all representative forms or types of states of heavenly blessedness in their origin; and it is because an influx of these states of blessedness uplifted your minds that you exclaimed, Lo! heaven in form.' But those that do not receive this influx see these paradises as nothing but forests. All who are in the love of uses receive the influx; but they who are in the, love of glory and not from use do not receive it.' Afterwards he explained and taught them what the several things in that garden represented and signified. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #13 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>13. Post haec Angelus dixit illis, "nondum est Meridies diei, venite mecum in Principis nostri Hortum, Palatio huic contiguum;" et iverunt, ac in introitu dixit, "en Hortus magnificus prae hortis in Coelesti hac Societate;" at responderunt, "quid dicis, non hic est Hortus; videmus modo unam Arborem, ac in ramis et in vertice ejus sicut fructus ex auro, et sicut folia ex argento, et horum oras exornatas smaragdis; et sub illa Arbore infantes cum alumnis illorum." Ad haec Angelus voce inspirata dixit, <sup>1</sup>"haec Arbor est in medio Horti, et a nobis vocatur Arbor nostri Coeli, et a quibusdam Arbor vitae. Sed pergite, et appropinquate, et aperientur oculi vestri, et videbitis Hortum;" ac fecerunt ita, et aperti sunt oculi, et videbant Arbores uberrimas fructibus saporis, circumligatas vitibus pampineis, quarum vertices cum fructibus nutabant versus Arborem vitae in medio.</p><p>[2] Arbores hae in continua serie consitae erant, quae exibat et pergebat in perennes orbes seu gyros sicut perpetuae helicis; erat perfecta Helix arborea, in qua species post species continue secundum nobilitates fructuum sequebantur: principium circumgyrationis distabat ab Arbore in medio insigni intervallo, ac intervallum coruscabat jubare lucis, ex quo arbores gyri splendebant splendore successivo et continuato a primis ad ultimas: primae arbores erant omnium praestantissimae, fructibus opimis luxuriantes, vocatae Paradisiacae, nusquam visae quia non datae nec dabiles in terris Mundi naturalis; post has excipiebant arbores olei; post has arbores vini; post has arbores fragrantiae; ac ultimo arbores ligni utiles ad fabricas. Hic et ibi in hac Helice arborea seu in hoc gyro erant Sedilia formata ex adductis <sup>2</sup>et complicatis propaginibus arborum a tergo, ac opimata et exornata fructibus illarum. In perpetuo illo Orbe arboreo erant ostia, quae patebant in floreta, et ab his in vireta, distincta in areas et toros.</p><p>[3] Comites Angeli his visis exclamabant, "en Coelum in forma; quocunque vertimus acies oculorum nostrorum, influit aliquid Coeleste Paradisiacum, quod est ineffabile." His auditis Angelus gavisus est, et dixit, "omnes Horti nostri Coeli sunt Formae repraesentativae seu Typi beatitudinum coelestium in suis originibus, et quia influxus harum beatitudinum elevavit mentes vestras, clamavistis, 'en Coelum in forma;' at illi, qui non recipiunt illum influxum, spectant Paradisiaca haec non aliter quam sylvestria; et omnes illi recipiunt influxum, qui in amore usus sunt; at illum non recipiunt, qui in amore gloriae sunt, et non ex usu." Postea exposuit et docuit, quid singula Horti istius repraesentabant et significabant. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: dixit;<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: exadductis </p>
