<h4 align="center"></h4><p>454、⑼淫行的性欲若濒于多样化的贪欲或奸污处女的贪欲，则变得更严重。原因在于，这二者是奸淫的帮凶，使之更严重。因为奸淫有轻微、严重和极严重之分；每一种都视它反对、因而摧毁婚姻之爱的程度而定。通过实际行为所确认的多样化的贪欲和奸污处女的贪欲，会毁灭婚姻之爱，可以说将它沉入海底，这一点可见于随后有关它们的章节。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>454、（9）因为这两者比通奸更严重。是轻度通奸，严重通奸还是更严重的通奸，是要根据其对婚姻之爱的破坏程度而定的。我们将在后面章节中讲到以上两种行为会使婚姻之爱完全丧失，如同沉入海底。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #454 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>454. (ix) The lust for fornicating becomes more serious, in so far as it tends towards a desire for variety or for deflowering virgins.<p>The reason is that these two are additional aggravations of adultery. For there are mild, serious and very serious kinds of adultery, each of which carries weight depending on the extent to which it opposes and so destroys conjugial love. It will be seen in the following chapters on these subjects that the desire for variety and for deflowering virgins, if reinforced by actual experiences, lay waste conjugial love and drown it as if in the depths of the sea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #454 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>454. 9. A lust to fornicate is more serious as it verges toward a lust for variety and toward a lust to deflower. The reason is that these two lusts are augmentations to adultery, thus making it worse. For there are milder adulteries, serious adulteries, and more serious ones; and each is judged according to its opposition to, and thus destructiveness of, conjugial love. We will see in chapters to follow regarding these lusts that, when confirmed by actual deeds, a lust for variety and a lust to deflower wipe out conjugial love and sink it, so to speak, to the bottom of the sea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #454 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>454. 9. A desire for fornication is more serious as it shades off towards a desire for promiscuity and a desire for defloration. The reason is that these two things reinforce adultery and thus make it worse. For there is mild, serious, and very serious adultery, and the details are weighed according to their opposing, and therefore destroying, married love.<p>Articles about it to come later will show that desire for promiscuity and desire for defloration established by actual behavior ruin the love in marriage and sink it as if to the bottom of the sea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #454 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>454. IX. THAT THE LUST OF FORNICATING IS MORE GRIEVOUS AS IT VERGES TO THE CUPIDITY OF VARIETIES AND THE CUPIDITY OF DEFLORATION. The reason is because these two are accessories of adultery, making it more grievous; for adulteries are mild, grievous, and more grievous; and each kind is estimated according to its opposition to conjugial love, and thus its destruction thereof. That the cupidity of varieties and the cupidity of defloration, confirmed by actual deeds, devastate conjugial love and sink it, as it were, to the bottom of the sea, will be seen in the chapters concerning them which are to follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #454 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>454. (ix) The lust of fornicating is still more serious as it verges on the desire for variety and the desire to deflower. The reason is that these two are growths on adultery, therefore aggravating it. For there are milder, serious and more serious adulteries, which are estimated each according to its opposition and hence destructiveness to marital love. In the chapters to follow about the desire for variety and the desire to deflower, it will be seen that when these are strengthened by act, they desolate marital love and plunge it into the depths of the sea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #454 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>454. (9) That the lust of fornicating is more grievous as it inclines towards a desire of varieties, and towards a desire of defloration. The reason is that these two are accessories of adultery, and thus aggravate it. For there are mild, grievous, and more grievous adulteries; and they are adjudged in each case according to their opposition to conjugial love and hence their destructiveness of it. That the desire of varieties and the desire of deflorations, confirmed by Acts, lay waste conjugial love, and sink it as in the depths of the sea, will be seen in the chapters concerning them which are to follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #454 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>454. IX. Quod libido fornicandi gravior sit, sicut vergit ad cupidinem varietatum, et ad cupidinem deflorationis. Causa est, <sup>1</sup>quia haec duo sunt accessoria adulterii, ita aggravantia illud: dantur enim adulteria mitia, gravia, et graviora, ac penduntur singula secundum oppositionem et inde destructionem amoris conjugialis; quod cupido varietatum, et cupido deflorationis per actualitates firmatae, amorem conjugialem depopulentur, et submergant quasi in fundo maris, in Transactionibus insequentibus de illis videbitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: est_ (cum spatio vacuo) </p>
