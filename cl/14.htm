<h4 align="center"></h4><p>14、就在这时，君主的信使来了，君主邀请他们和他共进午餐。两个宫廷随从还给他们带来白色细麻衣，说：“请穿上它们，若不穿上天堂的衣服，任何人都不准到君主的席前。”于是，他们用带子系上这些衣服，跟在天使向导后面。天使把他们带到宫殿的露天院落，人们可以在此漫步以等候君主，还把他们引见给几组重要人物和主管，他们也在此等候君主。不一会儿，他们看见门开了，君主带着庄严的队伍从西边那扇宽门进来了。走在君主前面的是他的枢密院议员，之后是他的财政部要员，再后是他的宫廷成员。中间是君主，后面跟着各级大臣，最后是随从，总共一百二十人。<br><br>天使站在十个新人前面。这十人仅从穿着就能表明是访客。天使带他们靠近君主，恭敬地引见他们。君主没有停下脚步，对他们说：“来和我一起用餐吧。”他们跟着君主进入餐厅，见已摆好华丽的餐桌。餐桌中间是一个高大的黄金金字塔，它的架子上摆着一百道菜，排成三行，包括甜蛋糕、凝固的葡萄汁，还有面包和葡萄酒做成的其它美味。琼浆玉液般的美酒喷泉从金字塔的中间喷涌而出，液体从塔顶漫下来，注满酒杯。高大金字塔旁边有各种各样黄金制成的天堂图案，上面是盛满各种食物的盘子和碟子。盛放碟盘的这些天堂图案是源自智慧的艺术再现，它们是世上的艺术家所创作不出来的，也无法以世间的语言描述出来。盘和碟是银制的，上面雕刻的图案类似于其载体的图案。酒杯是由半透明的宝石制成的。这是餐桌的摆设。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>14、（1）这时，王子派人来了，请他们去用餐。同时两个随从带来亚麻 衣服，说道：“穿上这些衣服，不穿天国的衣服就不能坐到王子的桌前。”</p><p>于是他们穿装好随同天使一起被带到回廊，来到王宫，他们在那里等待王子。天使把他们介绍给在场的官员名流们。他们也在那儿等王子。</p><p>过了一会儿，门开了，他们看到王子的队伍在西边的路上走过来。前面走过来的是他的官员参士们，最后是官廷要员们。王子在他们中间，后面跟着随从。一共有一百二十人。</p><p>（2）站在十个新来的面前，（他们穿的同这儿的居民一样），天使向王子引荐了他们。王子没有停下来，对他们说：“来吧，与我一起用餐。”</p><p>于是他们一起来到餐厅，那里有一张摆设精美壮观的餐桌。中间有个金制的塔状架子，上面摆着一百个盘子，里面盛着点心，葡萄酒以及其它的美味。架子的中间喷出甘露般的美酒，酒从塔顶流出，将酒杯装满。</p><p>塔的周围是样式精美的黄金饰物，装着美味的食物。这些饰物来自于智慧的艺术，在世间不可能有。盘子是银制的，上面雕着图案。酒杯是透明的玉制成的。</p><p>这就是桌子的摆设。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #14 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>14. While this was going on, a messenger arrived from the prince, who invited them to eat with him. At the same time two attendants of the court brought them clothes of fine linen, and said: 'Put these on, because no one is admitted to the prince's table unless he wears the clothes of heaven.'<p>So they fastened these on with a girdle and followed their angel, who brought them into an open courtyard of the palace, where people could stroll, to wait for the prince. There the angel introduced them to groups of important people and governors, who were also awaiting the prince. After a short time they saw the doors thrown open, and through a rather wider door on the west the prince entered with a dignified procession. He was preceded by his privy councillors, then came his treasury councillors, and after them the leading members of the court. In their midst walked the prince, followed by courtiers of various ranks, and finally the attendants. Altogether they numbered a hundred and twenty.</p><p>[2] The angel was standing in front of the ten newcomers, who were dressed to look like residents. He approached the prince with them and respectfully introduced them. The prince without pausing in his progress said to them: 'Come and eat with me.'<p>They followed him into the dining-room and saw a table magnificently set out. In the middle was a lofty pyramid of gold, with a hundred dishes ranged in three rows on their stands. On the dishes were sugared cakes and crystallised grape-juice, together with other delicacies made of bread and wine. Through the middle of the pyramid burst a sort of fountain of wine like nectar; the liquid spread out from the top of the pyramid, and filled goblets. By the side of this lofty pyramid were various heavenly designs made of gold, on which were plates and saucers filled with food of every kind. The heavenly designs on which the plates and saucers stood were artistic representations based on wisdom, which no art in the world could create, nor can they be described in worldly language. The plates and saucers were of silver, engraved all round with designs on a plane surface similar to those of their supports. The goblets were made of translucent gems. Such was the setting of the table. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #14 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>14. While they were thus engaged, a messenger arrived from the prince, who invited them to break bread with him. And at the same time two attendants of the court brought linen garments and said, "Put these on, because no one is allowed at the table of the prince without being dressed in the garments of heaven."<p>So they girded themselves and accompanied their angel, and they were led into a cloister, the enclosed courtyard of the palace, where they waited for the prince. And the angel introduced them there into gatherings that included dignitaries and officials who were also awaiting the prince.<p>Then behold, a short while later the doors were opened, and through one broader doorway on the west side they saw the prince entering in the line of a grand procession. Preceding him were the privy councillors. After these came the cabinet councillors, and behind them the principal officials of the court. In the middle of them was the prince, followed by courtiers of various distinction and finally attendants. All told, they numbered up to one hundred and twenty persons.</p><p>[2] Standing before the ten newcomers (who by their dress then looked like residents), the angel went with them to the prince and respectfully presented them. And the prince without pausing in the procession said to them, "Come take bread with me."<p>So they followed into the dining hall, where they saw a table magnificently set. In the center of the table they saw a high pyramid of gold with a hundred saucers in three rows upon its tiers, containing cakes and wine jellies, along with other delicacies made from cake and wine. And up through the middle of the pyramid gushed what appeared to be a spurting fountain of nectarlike wine, whose stream sprayed out from the top of the pyramid and filled the goblets.<p>Around the sides of this high pyramid were various heavenly forms of gold, holding plates and dishes filled with all sorts of foods. The heavenly forms holding the plates and dishes were forms of art arising from wisdom, forms which in the world cannot be depicted in any field of art or described in words. The plates and dishes were made of silver, engraved all around their surface with forms like the forms on which they rested. The goblets were made of translucent gems.<p>That was how the table was set. </p>

While they were at this a messenger came from the prince, who invited them to eat bread with him, and at the same time two house attendants brought fine linen clothes and said, "Put these on, for no one is admitted to the prince's table without wearing the clothes of heaven."<p>They dressed and joined their angel, who led them into an open porch, a promenade of the palace, and they waited for the prince. The angel kept introducing them to eminent people and managers who were also waiting for the prince. Within an hour a double door opened, and sure enough, they saw him make his entrance through a wide door on the west in the order and pomp of a procession. Before him went the chief counselors, then the chamberlains, and after them the nobles of the court. Among them was the prince, and after him courtiers of various degrees, and last the attendants, numbering a hundred and twenty altogether.<p>Staying in front of the ten newcomers (now that they were dressed as guests), the angel approached the prince with them and reverently presented them. The prince did not linger in his procession, but said to them, "Come with me to bread," and they followed into the dining room and saw a splendidly prepared table. In the middle of it was a high pyramid of gold, with a hundred small dishes in a triple row on its trays. On the dishes were cakes, jellied wine, and other: delicacies made of cake and wine. Through the center of the pyramid gushed a leaping fountain of wine, like nectar, and the stream divided, as it came out of the top of the pyramid, and filled the cups.<p>On either side of this high pyramid were various heavenly shapes of gold with dishes and plates of every kind of food on them. The heavenly shapes that held the dishes and plates were forms of art from wisdom that no worldly art could devise nor any words describe. The plates and dishes were of silver, engraved around the edges with designs like the ones on their supporting forms. The cups were clear gems. This is how the table was furnished. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #14 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>14. While they were thus engaged, a message came from the Prince, inviting them to eat bread with him. At the same time, two court attendants brought garments of fine linen, saying, "Put these on; for no one is admitted to the Prince's table unless arrayed in the garments of heaven." They then made themselves ready and, accompanying their angel, were led into an uncovered portico, an ambulatory of the palace, where they awaited the Prince. There the angel presented them to dignitaries and magistrates who also were waiting for the prince. And lo, after a short time, the doors were opened and they saw him enter, in the order and pomp of procession, through a door at the west which was wider than the others. Before him went the privy councilors, then councilors from the chambers, and after them, the chief men of the court, midway among whom was the prince himself. Then came courtiers of various ranks, and lastly guards, numbering in all a hundred and twenty Persons.</p><p>[2] The angel standing in front of the ten new-comers, who from their apparel seemed like natives of the place, approached the prince and reverently presented them; and the prince, without stopping the procession, said to them, "Come, dine with me." They then followed him into the dining hall and saw a magnificently spread table. In its center was a high pyramid of gold, and on the forms of this pyramid, in three rows, were a hundred small dishes containing sweet cakes, jellied wine, and other delicacies made of cake and wine. Through the center of the pyramid gushed a leaping fountain of wine, like nectar, the stream of which was diverted from the top of the pyramid and filled the cups. On either side of this lofty pyramid were various heavenly forms in gold, on which were dishes and plates filled with food of every kind. The heavenly forms which held the dishes and Plates were forms of art from wisdom, such as in the world no art can produce nor words describe. The dishes and plates were of silver, engraved around their edges with designs like those on their supporting forms. The cups were of pellucid gems. Such was the furniture of the table. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #14 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>14. While they were listening a messenger arrived from the prince, inviting them to break bread with him. Two court attendants at the same time brought garments of fine linen, and bade them: "Put these on, for no one is admitted to the prince's table unless he is clothed in the garments of heaven."<p>They dressed, and accompanied by their angel were led into a corridor, an ambulatory of the palace, where they awaited the prince. There the angel introduced them among noted and influential men who were also expecting the prince. Soon the doors opened, and by a wide one on the west they saw the prince enter in the order and pomp of a procession. Before him went the chief counsellors, then the chamberlains, and then the heads of the court. Midway came the prince, followed by courtiers of different ranks, and lastly by personal attendants - in all a hundred and twenty persons.</p><p>[2] The angel at the head of the ten newcomers (who in their dress looked like inhabitants now) approached the prince with them, and respectfully called attention to their presence. Without halting, the prince bade them, "Come, and dine with me."<p>They followed into the dining-hall, where they saw a table handsomely set. In the center was a high golden pyramid, with a hundred small dishes on three rows of shelves, holding cakes, wine-jellies, and other delicacies composed of wine and bread. From the top of the pyramid gushed a fountain with a wine-like nectar, the stream dividing as it fell and filling cups. At either side of the high golden pyramid projected different heavenly forms of gold, holding dishes and plates filled with every kind of food. The heavenly forms were forms of wisdom's own art, such as no art in the world can produce, nor can words describe them. Dishes and plates were of silver, they and their supporting forms graven around with reliefs of similar pattern. The cups were of transparent gems. Such was the arrangement of the table. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #14 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>14. While they were thus engaged, a messenger came from the prince, who invited them to eat bread with him. And at the same time two of the court attendants brought garments of fine linen and said, 'Put these on; for no one is admitted to the prince's table unless arrayed in the garments of heaven.' And they made themselves ready, and accompanying their angel were led into an uncovered portico, an ambulatory of the palace, and awaited the prince; and there the angel brought them into intercourse with the great men and magistrates, who also were waiting for the prince. Within an hour, lo! the doors were opened, and by a wider door on the western side they saw him enter in the order and pomp of procession. Before him went the chief counselors, then chamberlains, and after them the chief men of the court. In the midst of these was the prince, and after him courtiers of various degree, and lastly guards, numbering in all a hundred and twenty. The angel standing before the ten new-comers, who now appeared from their apparel as inhabitants, approached the prince with them and reverently presented them; and the prince as he passed, without stopping, said to them, 'Come with me to meat.' And they followed into the dining-hall, and saw a table magnificently spread. In the middle of it was a high pyramid of gold, with a hundred small dishes in triple order upon its forms, on which were cakes, condensed must of wines, and other delicacies made of bread and wine together; and through the center of the pyramid there issued as it were a springing fountain of nectarous wine, the streams of which divided from the top of the pyramid and filled the cups. On either side of this high pyramid were various heavenly forms in gold, on which were dishes and plates filled with food of every kind. The heavenly forms that held the dishes and plates were forms of art from wisdom, such as in the world no art can devise and no words describe. The dishes and plates were of silver, graven all around in relief upon a plane with forms similar to their supports. The cups were of pellucid gems. Such was the furniture of the table. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #14 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>14. Cum in his erant, venit nuntius a Principe, qui invitavit illos ad comedendum panem secum; et simul tunc duo satellites aulae apportabant vestes byssi, et dixerunt, "induite has, quia nemo ad mensam Principis admittitur nisi indutus vestibus Coeli;" et accinxerunt se, et comitati sunt Angelum suum, et introducebantur in Hypethrum, ambulatorium Palatii, et exspectabant Principem; et ibi Angelus insertabat illos consortiis cum Magnatibus et Moderatoribus, qui etiam praestolabantur <sup>1</sup>Principem: et ecce post horulam apertae sunt fores, et per unam latiorem ab Occidente viderunt Ejus introitum in ordine et pompa processionis: praeibant illum Consiliarii a latere, post hos Consiliarii a cameris, et post hos Primarii ex aula: in horum medio fuit Princeps, et post illum aulici variae distinctionis, et ultimo satellites; omnes connumerati ad centum et viginti.</p><p>[2] Angelus stans ante decem novos advenas, ex vestitu tunc apparentes ut inquilini, <sup>2</sup>accessit cum illis ad Principem, et reverenter adduxit illos; et Princeps in procedendo non moratus, dixit illis, "venite mecum ad panem;" et sequuti sunt in Triclinium, et viderunt Mensam magnifice apparatam, in medio ejus excelsam Pyramidem ex auro cum centum scutellis in triplici ordine super formis suis, super quibus erant panes sacharini, et musta vinorum concreta, cum aliis lautitiis ex pane et vino confectis; ac per mediam Pyramidem scaturivit sicut fons saliens cum vino nectareo, cujus vena ex summitate Pyramidis dispersit se, et cyathos implevit. Ad latera hujus excelsae Pyramidis erant variae formae coelestes ex auro, super quibus erant patinae et patellae cibis omnis generis refertae: formae coelestes, super quibus patinae et patellae, erant formae artis ex sapientia, <sup>3</sup>quae in Mundo non aliqua arte exarari, nec voce describi possunt: patinae et patellae erant ex argento, circumcaelatae similibus formis in plano cum sustentaculis suis; cyathi erant ex gemmis pellucentibus: talis erat apparatus Mensae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: praestolobantur<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: inquilini;<br><br>3.&nbsp;Prima editio: saplentia, </p>
