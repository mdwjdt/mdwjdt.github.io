<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第六章  主与教会的婚姻及其对应关系</h4><p>116、此处之所以论述主与教会的婚姻及其对应关系，是因为若缺乏关于它的知识和理解，几乎没有人能意识到，就其源头而言，婚姻之爱是神圣，属灵和属天的，它出自主。诚然，在教会，有些人声称，婚姻和主与教会的婚姻有某种关系，却不了解这种关系的性质。所以，为了将这个主题呈现出来，以至于在某种理解之光中被看到，有必要详细论述构成主的教会之人所体验并在他们里面的神圣婚姻。此外，享有婚姻真爱的，正是这些人，而非其他人。不过，要解开这个秘密，须将本章分成以下若干节:<br><br>⑴在圣言中，主被称为新郎和丈夫，教会被称为新娘和妻子；主与教会的结合，并教会与主的相互结合被称为婚姻。<br><br>⑵主还被称为父，教会被称为母。<br><br>⑶为夫为父的主和为妻为母的教会所生育的后代全是属灵的，这就是圣言中众子众女、兄弟姐妹、女婿媳妇、以及其它关系术语的灵义。<br><br>⑷主与教会的婚姻所生育的属灵后代就是真理与良善。真理是理解、觉知和一切思维的源头；良善是爱、仁和一切情感的源头。<br><br>⑸人从由主发出并流入的良善与真理的婚姻获得真理，主将这真理与良善结合起来；主就这样在人里面形成教会。<br><br>⑹丈夫不代表主，妻子不代表教会，因为丈夫和妻子二者一起才能形成教会。<br><br>⑺因此，天使与世人的婚姻里并没有丈夫与主，以及妻子与教会的对应关系。<br><br>⑻但婚姻之爱、受精、生育、对幼儿的爱，以及发生在婚姻中并由婚姻引发的类似事件中却存在一种对应关系。<br><br>⑼圣言是结合的媒介，因为它来自主，因而就是主。<br><br>⑽教会来自主，就在靠近祂并照祂诫命生活的人当中。<br><br>⑾婚姻之爱取决于人内教会的状态，因为它取决于其智慧的状态。<br><br>⑿由于教会来自主，故婚姻之爱也来自主。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>116、这一章涉及主与教会的结合及其象征意义。因为不了解这一点，就不能看到婚姻之爱在其来源上是神圣的，是精神上的，是天国般的，它是来自于主的。教会中的一些人知道婚姻与主和教会的结合有关，但他们却不知道这种关系的本质是什么。</p><p>为了使这一关系能被理解，我们要详细讨论一下在主的教会中的人们的神圣婚姻，他们拥有真正的婚姻之爱。</p><p>我们分以下几点来解释：</p><p>（1）在《圣经》中主被称做新郎及丈夫，教会被称为新娘及妻子，主和教会的相互联系及教会和主的相互联系被称为婚姻（结合）。</p><p>（2）主被称为父，教会被称为母。</p><p>（3）做为丈夫的父与做为妻子的母所产生的后裔是一切精神上的事物。这就是《圣经》中儿子、女儿、兄弟、姐妹、女婿、媳妇及其它与后代有关的词的精神上的含义。</p><p>（4）主和教会相结合而产生的精神上的事物是真理，理解力接受力是一切思想和一切善。爱、仁慈及一切情感都来自于善。</p><p>（5）从来自于主的善与真理的结合中，一个人获得真理，主使得其真理与善结合，这样，主就在一个人身上建立了教会。</p><p>（6）丈夫不代表主，妻子不代表教会，因为丈夫和妻子一起构成教会。</p><p>（7）所以不论是天国中天使的婚姻，还是世上人的婚姻中丈夫都不是主的象征，妻子也不是教会的象怔。</p><p>（8）象征存在于婚姻之爱，生育后代，爱护小孩子及其它存在于婚姻之中的类似的方面中。</p><p>（9）《圣经》是这种结合的媒介，因为它来自于主，进而它就是主。</p><p>（10）教会来自于主，并且它存在于那些走进主并按主的戒律生活的人们中。</p><p>（11）婚姻之爱取决于一个人身上的教会的状态，因为它与人的智慧有关。</p><p>（12）所以，因为教会来自于主，婚姻之爱也同样来自于主。</p><p>现在来分述这些点。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #116 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>116. VI. THE MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH, AND ITS CORRESPONDENCE<p>The reason for including at this point a discussion of the marriage of the Lord and the church is that, without a knowledge and understanding of this, hardly anyone can know that conjugial love is in origin holy, spiritual and celestial, and that it comes from the Lord. There are of course those in the church who assert that marriages have some relationship with the Lord's marriage with the church, but without knowing what is the nature of that relationship. In order, therefore, to cast some intellectual light on these matters, it is necessary to deal in detail with that holy marriage experienced by and in those who make up the Lord's church. It is these and no others who have truly conjugial love. But in order to elucidate this secret, the discussion must be split into sections as follows.<p>(i) In the Word the Lord is called bridegroom and husband, and the church is called bride and wife. The linking of the Lord with the church, and the reciprocal linking of the church with the Lord, is called a marriage.<p>(ii) The Lord is also called father and the church mother.<p>(iii) The offspring of the Lord as father and of the church as wife and mother are all spiritual, and in the spiritual sense of the Word these are meant by sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law and other terms of relationship.<p>(iv) The spiritual offspring born of the Lord's marriage with the church are truths, the source of understanding, perception and every thought, and good deeds, the source of love, charity and every affection.<p>(v) From the marriage of good and truth proceeding and flowing in from the Lord a person receives truth, to which the Lord links good. This is how the church with a person is formed by the Lord.<p>(vi) The husband does not represent the Lord and his wife the church, because they both together, husband and wife, make up the church.<p>(vii) Therefore there is no correspondence of the husband with the Lord and of the wife with the church in angelic marriages in the heavens or in those of human beings on earth.<p>(viii) There is, however, a correspondence with conjugial love, the planting of seed and reproduction, the love of children and similar matters which arise in and from marriages.<p>(ix) The Word is a means of linking because it is from the Lord and thus is the Lord.<p>(x) The church is from the Lord, and is present with those who approach Him and live in accordance with His commandments.<p>(xi) Conjugial love depends on the state of the church, because it depends on the state of wisdom a person possesses.<p>(xii) Since the church is from the Lord, so too is conjugial love from Him.<p>There now follows an explanation of these points. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #116 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>116. THE MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH AND CORRESPONDENCE TO IT<p>This chapter also takes up the marriage of the Lord and the church and correspondence to it, because without a knowledge and understanding of the subject, scarcely anyone can see that conjugial love in its origin is sacred, spiritual and heavenly, and that it comes from the Lord. Some in the church indeed say that marriage has a relationship to the marriage of the Lord with the church, but they do not know what the nature of that relationship is.<p>In order to make this relationship perceptible to some sight of the understanding, therefore, we must discuss in detail that sacred marriage which exists with and in those people who form the Lord's church. They, too, and not others, possess truly conjugial love.<p>To explain this secret, however, we must divide our treatment into sections under the following headings:<p>1. In the Word, the Lord is called a Bridegroom and Husband, and the church a bride and wife; and the conjunction of the Lord with the church and the reciprocal conjunction of the church with the Lord is called a marriage.<p>2. The Lord is also called Father, and the church, mother.<p>3. The offspring from the Lord as Husband and Father and from the church as wife and mother are all spiritual offspring, and this is what is meant in the spiritual sense of the Word by sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and by other terms which have to do with descending generations.<p>4. The spiritual offspring that are born from the marriage of the Lord with the church are truths, from which come understanding, perception and all thought; and also qualities of goodness, from which come love, charity and all affection.<p>5. From the marriage of good and truth that emanates and flows in from the Lord, a person acquires truth, to which the Lord joins good, and in this way the church is formed in the person by the Lord.<p>6. A husband does not represent the Lord and his wife the church, because both husbands and wives together form the church.<p>7. Therefore neither in the marriages of angels in heaven nor in the marriages of people on earth does the husband correspond to the Lord and the wife to the church.<p>8. Rather, the correspondence rests with conjugial love, insemination, procreation, love for little children, and other things of a similar sort that occur in marriage and result from it.<p>9. The Word is the means of conjunction, because it is from the Lord and thus is the Lord.<p>10. The church comes from the Lord and it exists in people who go to Him and live according to His commandments.<p>11. Conjugial love depends on the state of the church in a person, because it depends on the state of his wisdom.<p>12. So, then, because the church comes from the Lord, conjugial love comes from Him as well.<p>Now follows the development of these points. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #116 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>116. Chapter 6. The Marriage of the Lord and the Church and Its Correspondence<p>We also deal here with the marriage of the Lord and the church and what it corresponds with, because without a knowledge and a grasp of this you can hardly know that the love in marriage is holy, spiritual, and heavenly in its source, and that it comes from the Lord. To be sure, some people in the church do say that marriages have a relationship with the marriage of the Lord and the church, but the nature of the relationship is unknown.<p>So, in order to place this in some intellectual light where it can be seen, we have to deal point by point with this holy marriage and with the fact that it exists among and within those who belong to the Lord's church. They and only they have real married love, moreover. Now, to shed light on these unknown things, the subject breaks down into the following topics:<p>1. The Word calls the Lord a Bridegroom and Husband and the church a bride and wife, and it says that the Lord's union with the church and the reciprocal union of the church with the Lord is a marriage.<p>2. Also, it calls the Lord a father and the church a mother.<p>3. The offspring of the Lord as father and the church as wife and mother are all spiritual, and in the Word's spiritual sense, this is the meaning of sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and other names, all family relationships.<p>4. The spiritual offspring born from the marriage of the Lord and the church are the truths that an intellectual grasp, perception, and all thought come from, and they are varieties of good that love, charity, and all feelings come from.<p>5. From the marriage of good and truth that comes from the Lord and flows down, humans receive truth, and the Lord joins good to it, and in this way the Lord makes a church within people.<p>6. A husband does not represent the Lord and a wife the church, because a husband and wife both together make a church.<p>7. So a husband is not the counterpart of the Lord nor a wife the counterpart of the church in marriages of angels in heaven and people on earth.<p>8. But there is a corresponding relationship with married love, impregnating, reproducing, love of children, and things like that, which are in marriages and come from them.<p>9. The Word is the connecting link, because it is from the Lord so it is the Lord.<p>10. The church is from the Lord and is within those who approach Him and live by His teachings.<p>11. Married love is aligned with the condition of the church among people, because it goes according to the state of their wisdom.<p>12. The church comes from the Lord, so married love does, too.<p>Now comes the explanation of these things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #116 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>116. THE MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH AND ITS CORRESPONDENCE<p>That here the marriage of the Lord and the Church and the correspondence thereof is also treated of, is because, in the absence of knowledge and understanding concerning it, hardly any one can know that in its origin, conjugial love is holy, spiritual, and celestial, and that it is from the Lord. Some in the Church do indeed say that marriages have relation to the marriage of the Lord with the Church, but the nature of that relation is not known. In order, therefore, that the subject may be so presented as to be seen in some light of the understanding it is necessary to treat in detail of that holy marriage which is with and in those who are of the Lord's Church. Moreover, it is these and no others who have love truly conjugial. For the elucidation of this arcanum, the present chapter will be distributed under the following articles:<p>I. That in the Word, the Lord is called Bridegroom and Husband, and the Church Bride and Wife; and that the conjunction of the Lord with the Church, and the reciprocal conjunction of the Church with the Lord, is called Marriage.<p>II. Also that the Lord is called Father, and the Church Mother.<p>III. That the offspring from the Lord as Husband and Father and the Church as Wife and Mother are all spiritual, and in the spiritual sense of the Word are meant by sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and by other names belonging to generation.<p>IV. That the spiritual offspring which are born from the marriage of the Lord with the Church are truths, from which are understanding, perception, and all thought; and goods, from which are love, charity, and every affection.<p>V. That from the marriage of good and truth which proceeds and flows in from the Lord, man receives truth, and to this the Lord conjoins good; and that thus the Church is formed by the Lord with man.<p>VI. That the husband does not represent the Lord, and the wife the Church, because both together, the husband and his wife, make the Church.<p>VII. Therefore, that in the marriages of angels in the heavens and of men on earth, there is not a correspondence of the husband with the Lord and of the wife with the Church.<p>VIII. But that there is a correspondence with conjugial love, semination, prolification, the love of infants, and similar things which are in marriages and from them.<p>IX. That the Word is the medium of conjunction because it is from the Lord and thus is the Lord.<p>X. That the Church is from the Lord and is with those who approach Him and live according to His commandments.<p>XI. That conjugial love is according to the state of the Church because according to the state of wisdom with man.<p>XII. And because the Church is from the Lord, that conjugial love also is from Him.<p>The explanation of the above now follows: </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #116 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>116. V. THE MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH, AND ITS CORRESPONDENCE<p>We also deal at this point with the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and its correspondence, because without knowledge and intelligence on this subject one can hardly know that marital love is holy, spiritual and celestial in origin and is from the Lord. Some in the Church do say that marriages bear a relation to the marriage of the Lord and the Church, but what the relation is, is not known. In order to place the relation in some light of the understanding, we give a separate chapter to that holy marriage, which is with and in those who constitute the Lord's Church; these and no others have true marital love. To elucidate this arcanum, our discussion is to be divided into the following propositions:<p>I. In the Word the Lord is called Bridegroom and Husband and the Church Bride and Wife; and the conjunction of the Lord with the Church and the reciprocal conjunction of the Church with the Lord, is called marriage.<p>II. So, too, the Lord is called Father, and the Church Mother.<p>III. The offspring of the Lord as Father and of the Church as Wife and Mother are all spiritual, and are meant in the spiritual sense of the Word by sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and by other names denoting generation.<p>IV. The spiritual offspring, born of the marriage of the Lord and the Church, are truths, from which are understanding, perception and all thought; and goods, from which are love, charity and all affection.<p>V. From the marriage of good and truth, proceeding and in flowing from the Lord, the human being receives truth; to this the Lord conjoins good; and so the Church is formed with man by the Lord.<p>VI. The husband does not represent the Lord and the wife the Church, inasmuch as both together, husband and wife, constitute the Church.<p>VII. There is therefore no correspondence of the husband with the Lord or of the wife with the Church in the marriages either of the angels in heaven or of men on earth.<p>VIII. But the correspondence is with marital love, impregnation, the bearing of offspring, love for children, and like things in and of marriages.<p>IX. The Word is the medium of conjunction, for it is from the Lord, and is the Lord.<p>X. The Church is from the Lord and with those who approach Him and live according to His commandments.<p>XI. Marital love is according to the state of the Church with a man, because it is according to the state of wisdom with him.<p>XII. Because the Church is from the Lord, marital love also is.<p>Explanation of the propositions follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #116 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>116. ON THE MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH, AND ITS CORRESPONDENCE.<p>The marriage of the Lord and the Church, and the correspondence of it, are also treated of here, because without knowledge and understanding as to this, one can scarcely apprehend that conjugial love in its origin is holy, spiritual, and heavenly, and that it is from the Lord. It is indeed said by some in the Church that marriages have a relation to the marriage of the Lord with the Church, but what that relation is is not known. In order therefore, that the subject may be so presented as to be seen in some light of the understanding, it is necessary that that holy marriage, which is with and in those that are the Lord's Church, should be treated of with particularity. With them also, and not with others, there is love truly conjugial. But, for the elucidation of this secret, this treatment is to be divided under the following heads:<p>(1) That in the Word the Lord is called the Bridegroom and Husband, and the Church, the Bride and Wife; and that the conjunction of the Lord with the Church, and the reciprocal conjunction of the Church with the Lord is called Marriage.<p>(2) Also that the Lord is called Father and the Church, Mother.<p>(3) That the offspring from the Lord as Husband and Father, and the Church as Wife and Mother are all spiritual; and are meant in the spiritual sense of the Word by sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and by other names which are those of generation.<p>(4) That the spiritual offspring, which are born from the marriage of the Lord with the Church are truths, from which come understanding, perception, and all thought; and goods, from which are love, charity, and all affection.<p>(5) That from the marriage of good and truth, which proceeds and flows in from the Lord, man receives truth, and to this the Lord conjoins good; and that thus the Church is formed with man by the Lord.<p>(6) That the husband does not represent the Lord and the wife the Church; because both together, the husband and wife, make the Church.<p>(7) Therefore, that in the marriages of angels in the heavens and of men on earth, there is not a correspondence of the husband with the Lord and of the wife with the Church.<p>(8) But that there is a correspondence with conjugial love, with semination, prolification, the love of children, and like things which are in marriages and from them.<p>(9) That the Word is the medium of conjunction, because it is from the Lord and thus is the Lord.<p>(10) That the Church is from the Lord, and is with those who come to Him and live according to His commandments.<p>(11) That conjugial love is according to the state of the Church, because it is according to the state of wisdom with man.<p>(12) And because the Church is from the Lord conjugial love also is from Him.<p>The explanation of these now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #116 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>116. DE CONJUGIO DOMINI ET ECCLESIAE, ET DE EJUS CORRESPONDENTIA <p>Quod de Conjugio Domini et Ecclesiae, et de ejus Correspondentia hic quoque agatur, est quia absque scientia ac intelligentia de illo, vix aliquis potest nosse, quod Amor conjugialis sit in origine sua sanctus, spiritualis et coelestis, et quod sit a Domino. Dicitur quidem a quibusdam in Ecclesia, quod Conjugia relationem habeant ad Conjugium Domini cum Ecclesia, sed qualis illa relatio est, nescitur; ut itaque haec in aliquam lucem intellectus sistatur videnda, necessum est, ut de Sancto illo Conjugio, quod est apud illos et in illis, qui Ecclesia Domini sunt, singulariter agatur; his etiam et non aliis est Amor vere conjugialis.
