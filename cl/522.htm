After this I returned home, and a day later, recalling these pitiful sights, I looked towards the same forest, and saw that it had disappeared; its place was taken by a sandy plain with a lake in the middle containing some red snakes. Some weeks later, looking that way again, I saw on the right side of it some ploughed land and farmers working on it; and some weeks later still I saw a new crop growing out of this land with a hedge round it.<p>Then I heard a voice from heaven: 'Go into your room, shut the door, and concentrate on the work you have started on the Book of Revelation. You are to bring this to completion within two years.' <sup >1</sup></p>

In its place was a sandy plain, and in the middle of it a lake, having some red snakes in it.<p>Several weeks later, however, when I again looked in that direction, I saw to the right side of the site a stretch of fertile land, and on it several farmers. And several weeks again after that I saw new growth sprouting from that piece of land, surrounded by bushes.<p>At that time I then heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Go into your chamber, shut the door, and attend to the work begun on the Apocalypse; and pursue this in two years to a conclusion." </p>

Some weeks later, looking again in that direction, I saw, on its right side, a fallow field wherein were several husbandmen. Again, some weeks later, I saw emerging from that fallow field new ploughed land surrounded by bushes. I then heard a voice from heaven,. "Enter into your chamber and shut the door and give your attention to the work on the Apocalypse now commenced, and pursue it to the end within two years." <sup >1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED was published in April 1766, and CONJUGIAL LOVE in October 1768. </p>

The next day, recalling those sad scenes, I looked toward the same forest and saw that it had been cleared away.

Again some weeks later I noticed that the ploughed land had become a field with crops, surrounded by small trees.<p>Then I heard a voice from heaven, "Enter into your chamber and shut the door, and give yourself to the work begun on the Apocalypse, and prosecute it to a conclusion within two years."<p><a href="79.htm">79</a>. </p>

And then I heard a voice from heaven, 'Enter into your chamber and shut the door, and go on with the work begun upon the Apocalypse, and pursue it to the end within two years.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #522 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>522. Post haec reversus sum domum, et post diem ex recordatione tristium illorum, spectavi ad eandem Sylvam, et vidi illam disparatam, et loco ejus Campum arenosum, et in medio ejus Stagnum, in quo erant aliqui serpentes rubri. Sed post septimanas, dum iterum illuc spectavi, vidi a latere ejus dextro Arvum, et super eo aliquot Colonos; ac iterum post septimanas vidi ex Arvo illo enascens Novale circumcinctum arbustis: et audivi tunc vocem e Coelo, "intra in Cubiculum tuum, et claude januam, et intende operi incepto in Apocalypsi; et hoc intra <sup>1</sup>biennium persequere ad finem."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: infra </p>
