<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第469节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>469、许多男人之所以仍将不忠的妻子留在家中，是因为：<br><br>①这个男人或丈夫害怕与妻子对簿公堂，指控她通奸，因而将她的罪行公之于众；因为他若没有一个能判她有罪的目击证人或等效证据，就会被男人会众中隐藏的指责和女人会众中公开的指责所淹没。<br><br>②他还害怕不忠的妻子狡辩，同样害怕法官偏向她，从而导致他声名狼藉。<br><br>③除了这些原因外，她在提供家庭服务方面的优势也让他打消将其从家中分离出去的念头，如：他们尚有年幼的孩子，因为即便不忠的妻子也能展示出母爱；无法单独履行的相互责任把他们联结在一起；妻子拥有父母遗产的继承权，或来自亲戚或熟人的恩惠，并有希望靠他们发财；他珍惜当初与她的亲密关系；她变成奸妇后，知道如何花言巧语、虚情假意地巧妙抚慰丈夫，以免被指控。<br><br>还有其它理由，它们本身因是离婚的合法理由，故也是找情妇或纳妾的合法理由。将犯奸淫的妻子留在家中的理由并不废除离婚的理由。除了无耻之徒外，谁还会去维护婚床的权利，与一个奸妇共享他的床榻？这种事若零星发生，则不算确凿证据。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>469、以下是为什么有些男人还将不忠的妻子容在家中。</p><p>（1）丈夫害怕通过上法庭，公布妻子的奸情会带来公众的指责，若没有成功地证实妻子的行为，男人会被指责。</p><p>（2）他会害怕妻子的巧言辩解，以及法官的偏袒会给他带来不好的名声。</p><p>（3）除此之外，妻子在家中所做的工作会使丈夫不与她分离。比如，若他们有小孩子，即使不忠的妻子也有母亲的爱，他们有共同的责任而不能分开。若妻子得到家人的喜欢，并有从家人继承财产的可能。若他珍稀与她最初时有的彼此相知的情况。若在变得不忠后，女人会哄丈夫以便使自己不被告发。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #469 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>469. The reasons why many men keep on at home a promiscuous wife are:<p>(a) The husband is afraid of fighting a case in court with his wife, accusing her of adultery and so making the charge public property. For unless he has an eye-witness or something equivalent to convict her, he would be overwhelmed with insults, hidden ones in gatherings of men, and open ones in gatherings of women.<p>(b) He is also afraid of his promiscuous wife's cunning excuses and the risk of judges taking her side, resulting in his name becoming notorious.<p>(c) Apart from these reasons there are the conveniences of household functions to persuade him not to banish her from his house; as for instance if there are young children, for whom even a promiscuous woman can show a mother's love; if they have mutual duties to keep them together, which cannot be performed separately; if the wife has a relationship by birth or patronage with close or less close relatives, so that she has hopes of inheriting from them; if he had formed a pleasant association with her to begin with; and if she, after becoming promiscuous, knows how to humour her husband cunningly with pretty jests and a pretence of politeness so that she is not blamed. There are other reasons too which, because they are lawful grounds for divorce, are also lawful grounds for taking a concubine. For the reasons for keeping her on at home do not remove the grounds for divorce, when she has become promiscuous. Can anyone of any worth maintain the rights of the marriage bed and share a couch with a promiscuous woman? If it does happen here and there, this is not a conclusive proof against it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #469 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>469. There are reasons why many men yet retain an unfaithful wife in the home.<p>1. The husband is afraid to go to court with his wife, to accuse her of adultery and thus to make the accusation public; for if eyewitness accounts or their equivalent failed to convict her, he would be enveloped in reproaches - covertly in gatherings of men, and openly in gatherings of women.<p>2. He fears as well skillful exonerations of herself on the part of his unfaithful wife, and also indulgences of her on the part of judges, and thus the disgracing of his name.<p>3. Besides these considerations, there are advantages in the domestic services she provides which persuade against separating her from the home. As for example: If they have little children, for whom even an unfaithful wife has a mother's love. If they share and are bound together by joint duties which cannot be severed. If the wife enjoys the favor and protection of family and relatives, and there is hope of fortune from them. If he cherished the loving familiarities he had with her in the beginning. And if after becoming unfaithful she knows how to skillfully soothe her husband with amiable pleasantries and pretended civilities so as not to be charged.<p>There are other considerations, too, which, because they involve legitimate grounds for divorce, involve also legitimate grounds for taking a mistress. For a man's reasons for retaining the wife in the home do not remove the ground for divorce when she has behaved licentiously. Who but a vile wretch can preserve the rights of the marriage bed and share his bed with a trollop? If it happens here and there, it is not a conclusive occurrence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #469 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>469. Many men still keep an adulterous wife on in their homes.<p> <p>The reasons are: <p> <p>(a) The man is afraid to sue his wife, charge her with adultery, and in this way publicize the offense openly. For if visual evidence or the equal of visual evidence did not bring a conviction, in groups of men he would be smothered in abuse quietly, and in groups of women, openly. <p> <p>(b) He also fears the clever pleas of his prostituted wife, and also the court's protection of her, and the resulting dishonor to his name. <p> <p>(c) Besides all that, there are the conveniences of life at home that argue against her separation from the home, such as if they have children, whom even an adulteress has a mother's love for; if they have mutual duties that stand in the way, keep them together, and cannot be broken off; if the wife has inheritance and assistance from relatives and friends, and there is hope of a fortune from them; if he had cherished the friendly relations with her in the beginning; and if, after she became a prostitute, she knows how to cleverly soothe the man with flattering wit and pretended friendliness so as not to be blamed.<p> <p>Other things, too, are in themselves legitimate reasons for divorce, so they are also legitimate reasons for having a concubine, since the reasons for keeping her on in the home do not take away the reason for divorce when she has committed adultery.<p> <p>Who but a scoundrel can keep the vows of the marriage bed in view and share a pillow with a prostitute? If it does happen here and there, that demonstrates nothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #469 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>469. The reasons why by many men the meretricious wife is nevertheless retained in the home are: 1. That the man fears to contest the suit with his wife, to accuse her of adultery, and thus to publish her crime abroad; for unless the testimony of eyewitnesses or the equivalent thereof resulted in her conviction, he Would be covered with reproaches, covert in assemblies of men and open in assemblies of women. 2. He fears also clever pleas in exculpation of his adulterous wife, and likewise the favoring of her by the judge, and thus the dishonoring of his name. 3. Besides the above, there are advantages in regard to domestic uses which dissuade him from separating her from the home, as, for instance, if they have small children towards whom even the love of an adulterous wife is maternal; if between them and conjoining them are mutual services which cannot be broken off; if the wife have parental inheritances or patronage from relatives or acquaintances and there is hope of fortune from them; if in the beginning he had enjoyed loving companionship with her; and if after becoming an adulteress she knows how cleverly to soothe the man with flattering pleasantries and pretended civilities, that she may not be accused; besides other reasons. What in themselves are legitimate causes of divorce, are also legitimate causes of concubinage. The reasons for the wife's retention in the home when she has committed whoredom do not take away the cause of divorce. Who but a man of vile character can observe the rights of the conjugial bed and share the couch with an adulteress? If this is done here and there it is not conclusive. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #469 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>469. Many men still retain the unfaithful wife in the home for such reasons as these: <p> <p>1. The man hesitates to bring suit against his wife, charging her with adultery, and to make her crime known to the public; if she were left unconvicted by eyewitnesses or the equivalent of eyewitnesses, he would be covered with reproaches, secret in companies of men, undisguised in companies of women. 2. He also fears his meretricious wife's adroit self-vindications, also her wheedling favor with the judges, to the disgracing of his name. <p> <p>3. Besides, there are advantages in domestic utility which counsel against a separation from the home, as when the two have small children for whom even a meretricious woman has a maternal love; or as when mutual employments exist between them and unite them and cannot be broken off; again, if the wife enjoys the favor and protection of kindred and relations, and there is prospect of a fortune from them; again, if the man had cherished lovely intimacies with her in the beginning; and if, since she became unfaithful, she is cunning enough to appease the man with smooth pleasantries and feigned courtesies, so as not to be blamed; besides other reasons. <p> <p>What are in themselves lawful causes of divorce, are also causes of concubinage; reasons for retaining the wife in the home do not remove the cause of divorce when the wife has committed whoredom. Who except a vile person can observe the rights of the marriage bed and share it with an adulteress? If it is done now and then, that settles nothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #469 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>469. The reasons why by many men the meretricious wife is yet retained at home are: (1) That the man is afraid to bring legal suit against the wife accusing her of adultery, and thus to publish her crime abroad; for if she were not convicted by eye witnesses, or the equivalent of eye witnesses, he would be overwhelmed with reproaches, secret in companies of men, and open in companies of women. (2) He fears also the crafty vindications of his adulteress, and her being shielded by the judges, and so the dishonor of his name. (3) Besides these there are circumstances of domestic utility which dissuade him from a separation from the house; for example, if they have small children towards whom even the adulteress has maternal love; if mutual duties interpose and conjoin, which cannot be severed; if the wife has favor and protection from kindred and relations, and there is hope of fortune from them; if he had held loving intercourse with her in the beginning and if since she became a harlot she knows how to artfully sooth the man with engaging pleasantries and pretended civilities, that she may not be blamed. Besides other reasons, which because the causes of divorce are in themselves legitimate are also legitimate causes of concubinage, for reasons of retention at home do not take away the cause of divorce when the wife has committed scortation. Who that is not vile can keep the laws of the conjugial bed and share the bed with a harlot? If this is done here and there it is not conclusive. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #469 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>469. Quod usque uxor meretrix a pluribus viris retineatur domi, sunt causae. 1. Quod vir timeat cum uxore contestari litem, accusare adulterii, et sic in forum promulgare crimen; nam si testificationes oculares aut ocularium pares illam non convictam facerent, operiretur ille contumeliis, tectis in caetibus virorum, et apertis in caetibus mulierum. 2. Timet etiam callidas expurgationes suae meretricis, et quoque patrocinationes ejus a judicibus, et sic prostitutionem nominis sui. 3. Praeter illa, dantur domesticorum usuum commoda, quae dissuadent separationem e domo; ut si illis infantes sunt, erga quos etiam meretricis amor est maternus; si officia mutua intercedunt et conjungunt, quae non possunt dirimi; si parentelae et clientelae sint uxori ab agnatis et cognatis, et ex illis spes fortunarum; si amabiles consuetudines cum illa in principio foverit; et si illa, postquam meretrix facta est, blandis facetiis ac civilitatibus simulatis callide sciat mulcere virum, ne inculpetur; praeter alia, quae quia in se sunt causae legitimae divortii, etiam sunt causae legitimae concubinatus; nam causae retentionis domi non tollunt causam divortii, dum scortata est; quis, nisi vilis, potest servare jura lecti conjugialis, ac torum sociare, cum meretrice: si fiat, hic et ibi, non concludit. </p>
