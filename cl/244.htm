<h4 align="center"></h4><p>244、⑼这些是内在冷淡的因素，但在很多情况下并未伴随外在冷淡。如果目前所界定和确认，并在内层造成冷淡的因素在外层也产生类似冷淡，那么分离就会和内在冷淡一样普遍。内在冷淡的例子和前面所论述的婚姻一样多，即：接受虚假宗教信仰的夫妻、持不同宗教信仰的夫妻和无宗教信仰的夫妻之间的婚姻。然而，众所周知，许多夫妻在共同生活中似乎是爱情和相互友谊的典范。下一章将说明就那些陷入内在冷淡的人而言，这爱和友谊的源头；该章的主题是夫妻间表面的爱情、友谊和善意的因素。<br><br>有许多因素将心智联结起来，同时却未将灵魂联结起来，其中包括前面（153节）所列举的某些因素。然而，内在冷淡仍潜藏于内，周期性地被发觉和感受到。在这类婚姻中，夫妻在情感上彼此分离，仅在表现于言行的思维上靠拢，以维持表面的友谊和善意。因此，他们对真正婚姻之爱的愉悦和快乐一无所知，更不用说它的幸福和极乐了。对他们来说，这些东西就跟神话差不多。像这样的人就在那些认为婚姻之爱的起源所具有的因素，和从欧洲各国聚拢来的九组“智者”所列举的因素一样的人之列，如前面记事(103至114节)所描述的那样。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>244、（9）这些原因造成内在的冷漠，但在许多情况下，不会同时带来外在的冷漠。</p><p>以上所述是造成内在的冷漠的原因。外在的原因还有很多，然而我们知道有好多夫妇生活在一起，好象他们拥有相互的友谊和爱，为什么会这样呢？这一点我们会在下一章即271节中讲述。</p><p>许多情况会使得头脑相联，但却不能使灵魂相联。这是在153节中提到的那些，但是这种内在的冷漠是隐藏着的，它会时不时地显现。这种情况下的夫妇在情感方面相互分离，但在言语行为上表现得象是相互结合着，这只是为了保护一种表面的友谊和互助。这样的结果是，他们不会有真正的婚姻之爱的乐趣，并且会丧失这方面的祝福。对他们来讲，真正的婚姻之爱会不可能。</p><p>这种人认为婚姻之爱的来源与103-114节的提的智者所讲的一样。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #244 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>244. (ix) These are in many cases the reasons for inward coldness, but not accompanied by outward coldness.<p>If the reasons so far defined and proved, which cause coldness at inner levels, brought about a similar coldness at the outer levels, then separation would be as common as inner coldness. There are as many cases of inner coldness as there are of marriages between couples accepting false religious beliefs, of different religions, or none, subjects already discussed. Yet it is well known that many couples live together like models of love and mutual friendship; the reasons for this in cases of inward coldness will be given in the next chapter, which is on the reasons for the appearance of love, friendship and good will between married couples.</p><p>[2] There are many reasons which link characters, but still not souls, including some of those listed above (<a href="183.htm">183</a>). But there is still coldness lurking within, which allows it in many cases to be noticed and felt. In these cases the affections of each partner diverge from those of the other, but their thoughts, as expressed in speech and behaviour, converge to give the appearance of friendship and good will. As a result they know nothing of the charms and pleasure, much less the happiness and blessings, of truly conjugial love. Such things they regard as hardly more than mythical. These belong to the party who pretend that the origins of conjugial love have the same causes as the nine groups of wise men assembled from different kingdoms, as described above in the account of experiences (<a href="103.htm">103-114</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #244 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>244. 9. The aforementioned reasons are causes of an inward coldness, but in many cases not at the same time of an outward one. The reasons enumerated and established so far are causes of coldness in inward states. If the same reasons were to produce a similar coldness in outward states, then as many separations would occur as there are instances of inward coldness - and there are as many instances of coldness as there are marriages of people who are caught up in falsities of religion, who have different religions, or who have no religion (which we have just discussed). Yet we know that many of them live together as though they loved each other and possessed a mutual friendship. Why this is so, however, in the case of people who are in state of inward coldness, will be told in the following chapter on the reasons for apparent love, friendship and favor between married partners. <sup >1</sup></p><p>[2] Many circumstances occur which join minds together but do not at the same time join souls. Among the circumstances are some of those recounted above in no. <a href="153.htm">153</a>. But still an inner coldness lies hidden within, and this coldness makes itself periodically noticed and felt. In such marriages, the partners depart from each other in their affections, and only draw together in their thoughts whenever these are manifested in their speech and behavior, in order to preserve an appearance of friendship and favor. In consequence they know nothing of the pleasantness and pleasure of truly conjugial love, and even less of its felicity and bliss. To them these are little more than fables.<p>People like this are among those who imagine the origins of conjugial love from the same causes as the nine companies of wise men assembled from the kingdoms of Europe, as reported in a narrative account earlier, nos. <a href="103.htm">103-114</a>.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="271.htm">271</a> ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #244 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>244. 9. For many people, the causes of inner coldness mentioned above are not causes of outward coldness as well. So far, we have been pointing out causes of inward coldness and explaining them. If these produced similar coldness outwardly, it would cause as many separations as there are instances of inner coldness - which are as many as the marriages mentioned above - between people with religious falsities, different religions, and no religion. But it is a well - known fact that many people live together as if they did have love and friendship for each other. The next chapter, on the reasons for apparent love, friendship, and favor between married partners, tells where people with inward coldness find this love and friendship.<p>There are many forces that join worldly minds together, but without joining souls, and some are mentioned above (no. 183).<p>But within lies a hidden coldness, so you sometimes observe it and sense it. The feelings of people like this go off in different directions, but when they put their thoughts into words and actions they agree with each other in order to seem friendly and favorable to one another. Therefore they know nothing about the pleasantness and delight of real married love, let alone its happiness and bliss, which for them are little more than myths.<p>The story in nos. <a href="103.htm">103-114</a>, above, is about people like this. On the source of married love, they make things up like the nine companies of the wise, brought together from different kingdoms. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #244 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>244. IX. THAT THE CAUSES ABOVE NAMED ARE CAUSES OF INTERNAL COLD, BUT WITH MANY, NOT AT THE SAME TIME OF EXTERNAL COLD. If the causes thus far defined and confirmed, being causes of cold in internals, were to produce a like cold in externals, the result would be as many separations as there are internal colds, and the latter are as many as the marriages, treated of above, between those who are in falsities of religion, those who are in diverse religions, and those who are in no religion. Yet it is well known that many live together as though love and mutual friendship were theirs. The source of this love and friendship with those who are in internal cold shall be told in the following chapter on the causes of apparent love, friendship, and favor between married partners.</p><p>[2] There are many causes which conjoin animi <sup >1</sup>but yet do not conjoin souls, among which are some of the causes recounted above (no. <a href="183.htm">183</a>). Yet cold lies hidden within, and at times this results in its being observed and sensed. With such persons, their affections are mutually divergent, but, for the sake of apparent friendship and favor, their thoughts, when these go forth into speech and conduct, are mutually accordant. Therefore they know nothing of the pleasantness and delight of love truly conjugial, still less of its happiness and bliss, these being to them little more than fables. Such persons are among those who make the origins of conjugial love to be from the same causes as did the nine companies of the wise brought together from different kingdoms, concerning whom see the Memorable Relation, nos. <a href="103.htm">103-114</a>.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Throughout Swedenborg's theological and philosophical works, the word animus (plural, animi) is used to designate the external mind which man has in common with animals, as distinguished from mens designating the rational mind which is peculiar to man. Animus also means the disposition, and is sometimes so translated in the present work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #244 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>244. (ix) The causes named above are causes of internal cold, but with many not at the same time of external cold. If the causes named and established so far, which are causes of cold in the internals, produced a like cold in externals, there would be as many separations as there are instances of inward cold. There are, indeed, as many internal colds as there are marriages of those who are in falsities of religion, in diverse religion and in no religion (of whom we have treated). Still, it goes without saying, many such partners live together as if they were loves and mutual friendships. We shall give the reason for this in the following chapter on "Causes of Apparent Love, Friendship and Favor between Partners." There are a number of causes which conjoin the lower minds but not the souls; some of the causes recited above at<a href="153.htm">153</a> are among them. But still cold lurks deep within, and now and then lets itself be seen and felt. With such partners the affections diverge, but the thoughts, when they issue in speech and action, make up to each other for the sake of seeming friendship and favor. Hence they know nothing of the loveliness and joy and still less of the enjoyment and blessedness of true marital love; these are hardly more than fables to them. Such people are among those who place the origins of marital love in the same sources as did the nine companies of the wise assembled from the kingdoms of Europe, of whom above in the Memorabilia (nn. 103-114). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #244 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>244. (9) That the causes above mentioned are causes of internal cold, but with many not at the same time of external cold. If the causes thus far indicated and established - which are causes of cold in internals - should produce a like cold in externals, then they would effect as many separations as there are internal colds; and there are as many colds as marriages of those who are in falsities of religion, who are in different religion, and who are in no religion, who have been treated of above. And yet it is known that many live together as loves, and as if in mutual friendship. But whence it is so with those who are in internal cold, shall be told in the following chapter, On the Causes of Apparent Love, Friendship, and Favor between Married Partners. There are many causes which conjoin the lower mind but yet do not conjoin souls. Among the causes are some of those recounted above in n. <a href="183.htm">183</a>. But still the cold lies interiorly hidden within, and here and there makes itself observed and felt. With them the affections mutually draw apart, but the thoughts, when they go out in speech and conduct, for the sake of apparent friendship and favor draw near. They therefore, know nothing of the loveliness and joyousness, still less of the felicity and blessedness of love truly conjugial. These, to them, are scarcely other than fables. They are among those who derive the origins of conjugial love from the same causes as did the nine companies of the wise brought together out of the kingdoms, about which in the Relation in n. 103-114. </p>
