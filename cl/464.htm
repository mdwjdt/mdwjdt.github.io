<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第464节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>464、⑵对基督徒来说，与妻子联结的找情妇或纳妾是完全不合法的、可憎的。这种方式之所以不合法，是因为它违背婚约；之所以可憎，是因为它违背宗教。违背这二者，就是违背主。因此，一旦有人在妻子之外又找情妇或纳妾，又找不出纯正的重大理由，天堂就向他关闭，天使也不再把他算在基督徒之列。另外，从那时起，他还会轻蔑地拒绝教会和宗教的一切，后来则不再将他的脸面或目光提到自然界之上，而是转向她，奉其为赞成其情欲的神明；然后，他的灵便因自然界的流注而活跃。我们将在下文揭示这种叛教的内在原因。这个男人自己则看不到这样找情妇或纳妾何等可憎，因为天堂向他关闭后，属灵的疯狂就临到他。但贞洁的妻子能清楚看到这一点，因为她是婚姻之爱，这爱使它感到恶心。因此，许多妻子后来拒绝与丈夫发生性关系，好像这种事会因碰触了这个男人从妓女那里沾染来的淫欲而玷污了她们的贞洁一样。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>464、（2）这是被禁止的是因为它是与宗教信仰格格不入的；还是与婚姻相对立的。与这二者同时有矛盾的就是与主有矛盾。所以只要有人不因为重要的原因在有妻子的情况下又与情人交往，那么天国对他来说就是关闭着的了。天使也不会将他算作基督徒。从那时起，他就是在与教会和宗教相冲突，不能将眼光放到自然之上。而将其视为对他自己的情欲的禁止，这种情况的内在原因将在以下继续讲。</p><p>这种情况下与情人交往的男人看不到其中的对立性，是因为天国关闭之后，他就会变得头脑疯狂。但是贞洁的妻子却会清楚地看到，因为她是婚姻之爱的体现。婚姻之爱因这种行为而被破坏。因此，这种情况下，有些妻子会拒绝与丈夫的结合，因为来自于荡妇的不良影响会破坏妻子们的贞洁。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #464 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>464. (ii) Having a concubine in association with a wife is [totally] unlawful for Christians, and detestable.<p>It is unlawful, because it is contrary to the marriage compact, and detestable because it is contrary to religion. Anything contrary to both of these is contrary to the Lord. So as soon as anyone without a genuinely weighty reason takes a concubine in addition to a wife, he finds heaven shut and the angels strike him off the roll of Christians. From then on he rejects everything to do with the church and religion, and no longer lifts his gaze above nature, but turns towards it as a power which approves his lust, and thereafter his spirit is animated <sup >1</sup>by its influence. The reason for this apostasy will be revealed later. The man himself does not see how detestable this is, because when heaven is closed to him spiritual folly takes over. But a chaste wife perceives it, because she is conjugial love, and this love is nauseous to it. Many wives therefore refuse afterwards to have sexual relations with their husbands, as if it would pollute their chastity by being infected with the lust which clings to the husband from his contact with prostitutes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #464 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>464. 2. Taking a mistress in conjunction with the wife is forbidden to Christians and abhorrent. It is forbidden because it is in violation of the marriage covenant, and it is abhorrent because it is in violation of religion; and anything that is in violation of the one and the other at the same time is in violation of the Lord. Therefore, as soon as anyone takes a mistress in addition to his wife without a real weighty cause, heaven is closed to him, and the angels no longer number him among Christians. From that time on he also scorns things having to do with the church and religion, and thereafter does not raise his eyes above nature, but turns to it as to a deity that sanctions his lust, the influx of which then moves his spirit. The inner reason for this apostasy will be disclosed in the considerations that follow.<p>The man himself who takes a mistress in such a circumstance does not see that it is abhorrent, because with the closing of heaven comes spiritual insanity. But a chaste wife sees it clearly, because she is the embodiment of conjugial love, and this love is revolted by such an action. For that reason, too, many of them subsequently refuse physical union with their husbands, as something that would contaminate their chastity by a contagious communication of the lust clinging to the husbands from their harlots. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #464 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>464. 2. Having a concubine while with a wife is totally impermissible for Christians, and is abhorrent. It is impermissible because it is against the marriage covenant, and it is abhorrent because it is against religion, and what is against both of these at once is against the Lord. So as soon as someone adds a concubine to a wife, without a valid, serious reason, it shuts him out of heaven, and the angels no longer count him among Christians. And from that time he scorns things that have to do with church and religion, and then he does not lift his face up above nature but turns to nature as a deity that favors his desire and whose influence gives his soul life from then on. The inner reason for this abandoning of faith will come out in what follows.<p>The man himself does not know that this way of having a concubine is abhorrent, because with heaven closed off spiritual folly comes on. But the chaste wife sees right through it, because she is married love, and it makes this love sick. Therefore, after this many of them also give up joining sexually with their husbands.<p>It would taint their chastity by the infection of the lust that clings to the men from the prostitutes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #464 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>464. II. THAT FOR CHRISTIANS, CONCUBINAGE CONJOINTLY WITH THE WIFE IS [ALTOGETHER] UNLAWFUL AND DETESTABLE. It is unlawful because it is against the conjugial covenant, and detestable because against religion, and what is against the latter and at the same time against the former is against the Lord. Wherefore, as soon as any one adjoins a concubine to his wife without a real weighty cause, heaven is closed to him and by the angels he is no more numbered among Christians. Moreover, from that time he spurns the things of the Church and religion, and afterwards does not lift up his face above nature, but turns to her as to a deity which favors his lust, by the influx of which his spirit is then animated. The interior cause of this apostasy Will be laid open in what follows. That such concubinage is detestable, this the man himself does not see because after heaven has been closed to him he becomes spiritually insane. But a chaste wife sees it clearly because she is conjugial love, and this love nauseates it. Therefore, many of them are then repellent to actual conjunction with their men, as something which would contaminate their chastity from the contact of the lust adhering to the men from the courtesans. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #464 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>464. (ii) Concubinage together with a wife is unlawful for Christians and detestable. It is unlawful, being against the marriage covenant; it is detestable, being against religion. What is at once against these two, is against the Lord. The moment, therefore, that one adds a concubine to his wife without weighty, real cause, heaven is closed to him, and he is no longer numbered among Christians by the angels. From that time he also spurns the things of the Church and of religion, and thereafter does not lift his face above nature, but turns to nature as to deity, because it favors his lust from the influx of which his spirit then lives. The interior cause of this apostasy will be disclosed in what follows. <sup >1</sup>The man himself does not see that this concubinage is detestable, for on heaven's being shut he becomes spiritually insane. But a chaste wife sees it clearly, for she is marital love, and this love sickens at it. For this reason many such wives thereafter refuse physical union with their husbands, as something that would contaminate their chastity by contagion from the lust clinging to the men from the courtesans.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See<a href="466.htm">466</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #464 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>464. (2) That concubinage conjointly with a wife is to Christians unlawful and detestable. It is unlawful because it is against the conjugial covenant; and it is detestable because it is contrary to religion, and what is at the same time contrary to the one and to the other, is contrary to the Lord. As soon therefore, as any man without weighty, real cause adds to his wife a concubine, heaven is closed to him, and he is no more numbered by the angels among Christians. And from that time he also actually spurns the things of the church and of religion; and afterwards does not lift up his face above nature, but turns to it as to a god that favors his lust, the inflowing of which then animates his spirit. The interior cause of this apostasy will be disclosed in what follows. The man himself does not see that this concubinage is detestable, because when heaven is closed to him he comes into spiritual insanity. But a chaste wife sees it, because she is conjugial love and this love nauseates it; therefore, also many of them refuse actual conjunction with their husbands after it, as a thing that would contaminate their chastity by the contagion of lust adhering to the men from the courtesans. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #464 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>464. II. Quod Concubinatus conjunctim cum uxore, sit illicitus Christianis, ac detestabilis. Quod sit illicitus, est, quia contra foedus conjugiale est, et quod detestabilis, est quia contra religionem, et quod contra hanc et simul illud est, est contra Dominum; quare ut primum aliquis absque sontica reali causa adjungit uxori concubinam, occluditur ei Coelum, et ab Angelis non plus inter Christianos numeratur: ex illo tempore etiam illa, quae Ecclesiae et Religionis sunt, aspernatur, ac postea faciem non supra naturam tollit, sed ad illam, sicut ad Numen, quod libidini suae favet, se vertit, ex cujus influxu dein ejus spiritus animat: causa interior hujus apostaseos aperietur in sequentibus. Quod hic Concubinatus detestabilis sit, ipse ille vir non videt, quia post occlusum Coelum factus est insania spiritualis; at uxor casta id perspicit, quia est amor conjugialis, et hic amor nauseat id, quare etiam plures ex illis ad actualem conjunctionem cum suis viris postea renuunt, sicut ad id quod contaminaret castitatem illarum ex contagio libidinis adhaerentis viris ex meretricibus. </p>
