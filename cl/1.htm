<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第一章  关于婚姻之爱的智慧快乐</h4><h4 align="center">前言：关于天上的快乐和婚礼</h4><p>1、我预见，读了接下来的内容和各章节末尾的记事后，许多人会认为它们纯属胡思乱想。但我郑重声明，它们绝非虚构捏造，而是我亲眼所见、实实在在发生的真事，而且是在我完全清醒而非无意识状态下看到的。主乐意将衪自己显现给我，并派我传达新教会的信息，这新教会就是启示录所说的新耶路撒冷。为此，主打开我心智和灵的内层，我由此得以和天使同在灵界，同时和世人同在自然界。如今，这种状态已持续了二十五年。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #1 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>1. THE DELIGHTS OF WISDOM ON CONJUGIAL LOVE<p>I. PRELIMINARIES<p>THE JOYS OF HEAVEN AND WEDDINGS THERE<p>I foresee that many of the readers of what follows here, and of the experiences recorded at the end of chapters, will believe them to be imaginative fiction. But I solemnly declare that they are not fictions, but things I have truly done and seen. Nor were they seen in some state of somnolence, but while fully awake. For the Lord has been pleased to show Himself to me, and to send me to teach the doctrines of the New Church meant by the NEW JERUSALEM in the Book of Revelation. For this purpose He has opened up the inner levels of my mind and spirit. This has allowed me to associate with angels in the spiritual world and at the same time with human beings in the natural world, something I have now experienced for twenty-five years. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #1 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>DELIGHTS OF WISDOM RELATING TO CONJUGIAL LOVE<p>1. I anticipate that many who read the following descriptions and the accounts at the ends of the succeeding chapters will believe they are figments of my imagination. I swear in truth, however, that they are not inventions, but actual occurrences to which I was witness. Nor were they witnessed in any condition of unconsciousness but in a state of full wakefulness. For it has pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me and send me to teach the doctrines that will be doctrines of the New Church, the church meant by the New Jerusalem in the book of Revelation. To this end He has opened the inner faculties of my mind and spirit. As a result, it has been made possible for me to be in the spiritual world with angels and at the same time in the natural world with men, and this now for twenty-five years. <sup >1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This work was originally published in the year 1768. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #1 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>1. PART 1<p>The Sensible Joy in Married Love<p> Chapter 1. Introduction: The Joys of Heaven and a Wedding There<p>1. I foresee that many people who read the following chapters and the remarkable stories after each chapter, are going to think that the stories are imaginative inventions. But I assert, in truth, that they are not invented but really done and seen - and not when my mind was in a trance, but when I was wide awake. In fact, the Lord Himself saw fit to let me see Him and has sent me to teach things about the new church that the Book of Revelation refers to as the "New Jerusalem." To do this He opened the inner levels of my mind for me, and this enables me to be in the spiritual world with angels and in the natural world with people at the same time - and this for twenty - five years now. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #1 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>1. PRELIMINARIES<p>CONCERNING THE JOYS OF HEAVEN AND CONCERNING WEDDINGS THERE<p>I foresee that many who read the things which follow, and the Memorable Relations at the end of the chapters, will think that they are inventions of the imagination; but I asseverate in truth that they are not inventions but are things actually done and seen; nor were they seen in any state of a mind asleep but in a state of full wakefulness. For it has pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me and to send me to teach the things which shall be of the New Church, meant by the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse. To this end, He has opened the interiors of my mind and spirit, whereby it has been granted me to be in the spiritual world with angels and at the same time in the natural world with men, and this now for twenty-five years. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #1 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>1. MARITAL LOVE: ITS WISE DELIGHTS<p>PRELIMINARY: THE JOYS OF HEAVEN AND A WEDDING THERE<p>I foresee <sup >1</sup>that many who read the Memorabilia immediately following and those after the chapters will believe that they are inventions of the imagination. I solemnly declare, however, that they are not inventions, but things which were actually done and seen - seen, moreover, not in a state of the mind asleep, but in a state of full wakefulness. For the Lord has been pleased to manifest Himself to me and to send me to teach what is intended for a new Church, meant by the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse. To this end He has opened the interiors of my mind and spirit, so that it has been my privilege to be with angels in the spiritual world and at the same time with men in the natural world, and this now <sup >2</sup>for twenty-five years.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original Latin this paragraph is enclosed in quotation marks. It occurs again in <a href="../tcr/851.htm">True Christian Religion 851</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;In the year 1768; Swedenborg was to live, and to continue in this privilege, four years longer.

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #1 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>1. THE DELIGHTS OF WISDOM PERTAINING TO CONJUGIAL LOVE.<p>PRELIMINARIES: THE JOYS OF HEAVEN AND NUPTIALS THERE. I foresee that many who read the following Relations and those after the chapters will believe they are fictions of the imagination; but I declare in truth that they are not fictions, but things actually done and seen. Nor were they seen in any state of the mind asleep, but in a state of full wakefulness. For it has pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me, and to send me to teach the things that will belong to the New Church which is meant by the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse. To this end He has opened the interiors of my mind and spirit, whereby He has given me to be in the spiritual world with angels and at the same time in the natural world with men, and this now for five and twenty years. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #1 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>1. DE GAUDIIS CAELI, ET DE NUPTIIS IBI. <p>Praevideo, quod multi qui legunt sequentia haec, et Memorabilia post Capita, credituri sint, quod sint imaginationis inventa; sed assevero in veritate, quod non sint inventa, sed vere facta et visa; nec visa in quodam statu mentis sopitae, sed in statu plenae vigiliae: placuit enim Domino Se Ipsum mihi manifestare, et me mittere ad docendum illa, quae erunt Novae Ecclesiae, quae per Novam Hierosolymam in Apocalypsi intelligitur; propter quem finem interiora mentis et spiritus mei aperuit; ex quo mihi datum est in Mundo Spirituali cum Angelis esse, et simul in Mundo Naturali cum Hominibus; et hoc nunc per viginti quinque annos. <sup>1</sup>,<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Haec paragraphus in prima editione signis citationis inclusa est. </p>
