<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第169节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>169、⑾妻子出于其爱不断思想丈夫对她的倾向，怀有与他联结的意图；而男人则不然。这和前面的解释(160节)是一致的，即：就妻子而言，与男人联结的倾向是恒久不变的；但就男人而言，这种倾向是变化无常的。由此可知，妻子不断思想丈夫对自己的倾向，怀有与他联结的意图。诚然，妻子对丈夫的想法会因她料理家务事而被打断，但它仍存留在其爱的情感中；并且对女人来说，这种情感不像在男人身上那样与其想法分离。不过，我所报告的这些事都是她们告诉我的，读者可参看后面几章末尾关于坐在玫瑰园里的七个妻子们的两个记事（293和294节）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>169、（11）妻子出于爱，不间断地考虑丈夫对自己的感受，希望他与自己合二为一。这点在丈夫身上并非如此，这点可以参见160节。女人对丈夫的考虑可能被家务所打扰，但它会保留在女人的情感中，女人的感受不象男人可以与其思想相分离，这点可参见293和294节。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #169 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>169. (xi) A wife is constantly led by love to think about her husband's inclination towards herself, with the intention of linking him to herself; [but it is different for a man.]<p>These points are inseparable from the previous explanation that the inclination to unite herself with her husband is constant and permanent in the case of the wife, but inconstant and fluctuating in the case of the husband; see the discussion of this [<a href="160.htm">160</a>]. From this it follows that a wife is continuously thinking about her husband's inclination towards herself, with the intention of linking him to herself. The wife's thinking about her husband is interrupted by the domestic duties which fall to her, but still she keeps up the affection for his love; and this affection is not separate from their thoughts in the case of women, as it is with men. But I report this from hearsay; see the two accounts of experiences with the seven wives who were sitting in the rose-garden, which will follow some chapters later [<a href="293.htm">293-294</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #169 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>169. 11. A wife continually thinks about her husband's disposition towards her, with a view to joining him to her. This goes along with what was explained above, namely, that a desire to unite her husband to her is constant and continual in a wife, but inconstant and intermittent in a husband. See what was said there. <sup >1</sup>It follows from this that a wife thinks continually about her husband's disposition towards her with a view to joining him to her. To be sure, a wife's thinking about her husband is interrupted by the domestic concerns which are under her care, but still it remains in the affection of her love; and in women, this affection does not become detached from their thoughts as it does in men. However, I am relating these things as they were told to me. See the two narrative accounts which come from seven wives sitting in a rose garden, which I have included at the end of one of the chapters later on. <sup >2</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No. <a href="160.htm">160</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="293.htm">293</a> and <a href="294.htm">294</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #169 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>169. 11. A wife is always thinking from love about a man's inclination toward her, with joining herself to him in mind. This fits in with what was explained above (see no. <a href="160.htm">160</a>) - that the inclination to unite with a man is steady and lasting for a wife but unsteady and alternating for a man. Consequently, a wife is continually thinking about her husband's inclination to her, with a view to joining herself with him. To be sure, a wife's thought about her husband is interrupted by her household problems, yet it stays in the feelings of her love, and for women these are not separate from thoughts as they are for men.<p>But I pass these things on as told to me. See the two stories about the seven wives sitting in the rose garden, which follow one of the chapters (nos. <a href="293.htm">293-294</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #169 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>169. XI. THAT [FROM HER LOVE], THE WIFE IS CONTINUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE INCLINATION OF THE MAN TO HERSELF WITH THE PURPOSE OF CONJOINING HIM TO HERSELF; [NOT SO THE MAN.] This coheres with what was previously explained [no. <a href="160.htm">160</a>], namely, that the inclination to unite the man to herself is constant and perpetual with the wife, but inconstant and alternating with the man. From this it follows, that the thought of the wife about the inclination of her husband to herself with the purpose of conjoining him to herself is continual. The thought of the wife about the husband is indeed interrupted by the domestic affairs which are under her care, still it remains in the affection of her love, and with women this does not separate itself from their thoughts as is the case with men. But these things I report as they were told me; see the two Relations by the seven wives sitting in the rose garden (nos., <a href="293.htm">293, 294</a>) which follow some of the chapters. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #169 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>169. (xi) A wife in her love is always mindful of the man's inclination to her, with the intent to conjoin him to her. This is bound up with what was explained above, that the inclination to unite the man to herself is constant and perpetual with the wife, but inconstant and recurrent with the man (see<a href="160.htm">160</a>). It follows that the wife's thought of the husband's inclination to her is continuous, with a mind to uniting him to her. Her thought about him is interrupted, of course, by the domestic matters which are her care, but still it persists in the affection of her love, which does not detach itself from the thought in women as it does in men. I am only reporting what I have been told. See the two Memorabilia <sup >1</sup>from the seven wives seated in the rose-garden.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Nn. <a href="293.htm">293-294</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #169 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>169. (11) That the wife is constantly thinking about the inclination of the man to herself, with the purpose of conjoining him to herself. This comports with the explanation given above, which see, that the inclination with the wife to unite the man to herself is constant and perpetual, but with the man is inconstant and alternating. From this it follows that the thought of the wife is continual about the inclination of the husband to herself, with a mind to conjoin him to her. The thought of the wife about the husband, it is true, is interrupted by the domestic affairs that are under her care; but still it abides in the affection of her love, and with women this does not disconnect itself from thought, as with men. But these things I relate as they were told. See the two Relations from the seven wives sitting in a garden of roses, which follow one of the chapters. <sup >1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;n. 293, 294. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #169 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>169. XI. Quod Uxor jugiter cogitet de inclinatione Viri ad se, animo conjungendi sibi illum. Haec cohaerent cum supra explicatis, his, quod Inclinatio ad uniendum sibi virum sit constans et perpetua apud uxorem, sed inconstans et alterna apud virum, quae videantur; ex illis sequitur, quod cogitatio uxoris continua sit de inclinatione mariti ad se, animo conjungendi sibi illum: discontinuatur quidem uxoris cogitatio de marito per domestica quae curae ejus sunt, sed usque manet in affectione amoris ejus, et haec se a cogitationibus apud foeminas non separat, sicut apud viros; sed haec ut relata refero; videantur duo Memorabilia a septem Uxoribus in Roseto sedentibus, quae post aliqua Capita sequuntur. </p>
