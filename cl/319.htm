<h4 align="center"></h4><p>319、⑵它还取决于他们生活所在的婚姻状态。我们在此所说的婚姻状态，不是指上一节所讨论的爱情状态，因为爱情状态会产生朝向或远离婚姻的内在倾向。此处指的是婚姻状态，它会产生朝向或远离婚姻的外在倾向。这种状态及其倾向是多方面的。如：<br><br>①家里尚有年幼的孩子，必须给他们找一位新母亲。<br><br>②想要更多孩子。<br><br>③家大业大，有男仆女佣。<br><br>④因在外忙于事业，无瑕顾及家中事务，所以若没有一位新女主人，怕有麻烦和意外。<br><br>⑤需要相互协助和服务，如在各种商业和贸易中的情形。<br><br>⑥此外，它取决于在世配偶的性格，即他/她在第一次婚姻后能否独自生活，也就是能否过没有配偶的生活。<br><br>⑦此外，前一段婚姻要么造成对婚姻生活的恐惧，要么造成对它的依恋。<br><br>⑧我听说，一夫多妻之爱、性欲，以及对奸污处女和多样化的淫欲会把有些人的心引向对再婚的渴望；有些人害怕犯下奸淫罪后会受到法律制裁，或名声扫地，故转而寻求再婚。此外还有其它许多原因产生结婚的外在倾向。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>319、（2）还取决于他们从前婚姻的状况。这里所说的婚姻状况不是指前面章节中所讲的爱的状况。因为爱的状况会使人产生支持或反对再婚的内在倾向。而这里所讲的婚姻状况是指影响人决定是否再婚的外在情况。这些情况会促使人们再婚与不再婚。比如以下情况：</p><p>1、若家中有年纪小的孩子，必须要为他们找到新妈妈。</p><p>2、若有要更多孩子的渴望。</p><p>3、若家中很大并且有男女服务人员。</p><p>4、若外在事务繁忙而无暇顾及家事，出于对出现麻烦或不幸事件的顾虑而必须找个新女主人。</p><p>5、若象商务中一样，需要有合作和责任的分担。</p><p>6、还取决于在世的一方的性格，是否他或她在第一次婚姻后能够独自过一种没有配偶的生活。</p><p>7、前一次婚姻或者会造成对婚姻的恐惧，或者会促进对婚姻的渴望。</p><p>8、我还得知一夫多妻的爱或性爱包括对诱奸的爱使一些人希望再婚。一些人因怕自己会去接触妓女而受到法律制裁或名声的丧失而希望再婚。</p><p>还有很多其它情况会造成现在的对婚姻的倾向。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #319 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>319. (ii) Contracting a second marriage after the death of a partner also depends upon the state of the marriage in which they had lived.<p>By the state of the marriage we do not here mean the state of love, which was dealt with in the last section, because this causes an inward inclination towards or away from marriage, but the state of the marriage which causes an outward inclination towards or away from it. This state together with its inclinations is manifold. For instance:<p>1. If the home contains young children, for whom a new mother must be sought.<p>2. If more children are desired.<p>3. If the household is wealthy and provided with servants of both sexes.<p>4. If unremitting business away from home distracts the mind from matters at home, and so without a new mistress there is a risk of trouble and accident. 5. If mutual help and duties demand it, as happens in some businesses and trades.<p>6. Moreover, it depends on the character of the surviving partner whether or not after the first marriage he or she can live alone without a partner.<p>7. Also the previous marriage either makes them afraid of married life or makes them keen on it.<p>8. I have been told that some people's dispositions have been influenced towards second marriages by polygamous love, sexual love, and the lust for deflowering virgins and for variety. Similarly some have been influenced by fear of legal proceedings or ill-repute, if they commit adultery. There are also many other reasons which produce outward inclinations to get married. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #319 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>319. 2. Whether to marry again after the death of a partner depends also on the status of the marriage in which they had been living. By the status of the marriage we do not mean the state of the love which we took up under the preceding heading, because the state of the love engenders an inclination for or against remarriage that is internal. By the status of the marriage we mean rather its circumstances which occasion an external inclination for or against. Such circumstances together with their resulting inclinations are manifold. For example:<p>1. If there are little children in the house and a new mother must be found for them.<p>2. If there is an earnest desire for still more children.<p>3. If the house is large and equipped with servants of both sexes.<p>4. If constant responsibilities outside the house divert the mind from domestic concerns at home, and trouble and misfortune are feared on that account without a new mistress.<p>5. If there is need for joint assistance and shared duties, as is the case in a variety of businesses and trades.<p>6. It depends, moreover, on the nature of the partner who is left, whether after the first marriage he or she can or cannot live alone or without a mate.<p>7. The previous marriage also imparts either a fear of married life or a preference for it.<p>8. I have been told that polygamous love and sexual desire, including a lust to deflower and a lust for variety, have led the hearts of some to a desire to remarry. Also that fear of the law and fear for their reputation if they were to go awhoring have led the hearts of others to it.<p>There are in addition many other circumstances which induce external inclinations towards remarriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #319 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>319. 2. Remarriage after the death of a partner also depends on the state of marriage the partners had lived in. Here "state of marriage" does not mean the state of love, dealt with in the last article, because the love produces an inner inclination toward or away from marriage. But the state of the marriage produces an outward inclination toward or away from it.<p>This condition, with its tendencies, is very involved. For example: (a) If there are babies in the home and a new mother must be provided for them. (b) If more children are desired. (c) If the home is large and furnished with servants of both sexes. (d) If things to be taken care of continually outside the home distract a man's mind from family matters at home, so that without a new wife there is fear of trouble and misfortune. (e) If they need mutual aid and service, as in different businesses and jobs. (f) Besides, it depends on the separated male or female partner's makeup whether they can or cannot live alone or without a partner. (g) Also, the previous marriage either leaves a fear of married life, or it leaves a partiality to it. (h) I have heard that polygamous love, love of the other sex and also lust for defloration and lust for variety lead some people's minds into a desire for marrying again. And that fear of the law and fear for their reputation, if they were to commit adultery, lead some people's minds into it - besides many other things that promote outward inclinations toward marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #319 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>319. II. THAT AFTER THE DEATH OF THE PARTNER, AGAIN TO CONTRACT MATRIMONY DEPENDS ALSO ON THE STATE OF MARRIAGE IN WHICH THEY HAD LIVED. Here, by the state of marriage is not meant the state of the love spoken of in the preceding article, for this produces an internal inclination for or against marriage. What is meant here is the state of marriage which produces an external inclination towards it or away from it. This state with its inclinations is manifold. For example: <p>1. If there are small children in the house and a new mother must be provided for them.<p>2. If more children are desired. <p>3. If the house is large and provided with servants of both sexes. <p>4. If continual forensic occupations withdraw the mind from domestic affairs at home, so that without a new mistress there is fear of trouble and misfortune. <p>5. If mutual aid and mutual services are required, as in various kinds of business and occupations. <p>6. Moreover, it depends on the native genius of the partner who is left, whether after the first marriage he or she can or cannot live alone, that is, without a consort. <p>7. Furthermore, the preceding marriage causes either a fear of married life or a favoring of it. <p>8. I have heard that the animi of some are led to a desire for repeated marriages by polygamous love and love of the sex, also by the lust of defloration and the lust of variety; and the animi of others, by fear of the law and their reputation if they commit adultery. Besides many other causes which move the external inclinations to matrimony. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #319 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>319. (ii) Contracting matrimony again after the partner's death also depends on the state of marriage in which the two had lived. Here we do not mean by the state of marriage the state of love which creates inward inclination toward or away from marriage (of which in the preceding proposition), but a state of marriage which creates outward inclination toward or away from it. This state with its inclinations is manifold.<p>1. There may, for instance, be little ones in the home for whom a new mother should be found.<p>2. More children may be desired.<p>3. The home may be large and provided with servants of both sexes.<p>4. Exacting activities away from home may take the mind off domestic affairs, and without a new mistress trouble and mishap may be feared.<p>5. Mutual help and duties may demand it, as in a number of businesses and employments.<p>6. It depends, moreover, on the character of the remaining partner whether after a first marriage he or she can live alone or without a consort.<p>7. The foregoing marriage also creates either a fear of married life or a leaning toward it.<p>8. I have heard that polygamous love and love for the sex, likewise the lust of deflowering and the lust of variety, have moved the minds of some to desire remarriage; as fear of law and regard to reputation have influenced the minds of others, who otherwise might commit adultery; besides many other reasons, which impel the external inclinations toward matrimony. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #319 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>319. (2) That whether to contract matrimony again after the death of a married partner depends also upon the state of marriage in which they had lived. By the state of marriage is not here meant the state of love, of which in the preceding section, because this causes an internal inclination for or against marriage, but the state of the marriage is meant which causes an external inclination for or against it, and this state with its inclinations is manifold: For example. <p>(1) If there are small children in the house and a new mother needs to be provided for them. <p>(2) If still more children are desired. <p>(3) If the house is large and equipped with servants of both sexes. <p>(4) If continual out-of-door occupations withdraw the mind from the affairs of the household at home, so that without a new mistress there is fear of trouble and misfortune. <p>(5) If mutual aid and mutual services are required, as in various kinds of business and occupation. <p>(6) Moreover, it depends on the peculiar qualities of the separated married partner, whether after the first marriage the one can or cannot live alone, or without a consort. <p>(7) The preceding marriage also either causes a fear of conjugial life, or favor towards it. <p>(8) I have heard that polygamous love, and the love of sex, also the lust of defloration, and the lust of variety, have led the minds of some into a desire for repeated marriages; and that the minds of some have been led by fear of the law, and for their reputation, in case they indulge in whoredom. Besides many other incentives which produce external inclinations to marriages. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #319 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>319. II: Quod post mortem conjugis iterum contrahere matrimonium dependeat etiam a statu conjugii, in quo vixerant. Per statum conjugii non hic intelligitur status amoris, de quo in antecedente Articulo, quia hic facit inclinationem internam ad conjugium aut a conjugio, sed status conjugii, qui facit inclinationem externam ad illud aut ab illo; et hic status cum suis inclinationibus est multiplex; sicut, <sup>1</sup>1. Si Infantes in domo sunt, et illis nova Mater prospicienda est. 2. Si Infantes adhuc plures in voto sunt. 3. Si Domus ampla est, ac instructa famulitiis utriusque sexus. <sup>2</sup>4. Si administrationes continentes foris abstrahunt mentem a familiaribus domi, et inde absque nova Domina timetur aerumna et casus. 5. Si mutua auxilia et officia poscunt, ut in variis negotiis et operis. 6. Praeterea a genio conjugis separati aut separatae, pendet, num post primum conjugium possit aut non possit vivere solus seu absque consorte. 7. Conjugium praecedens etiam vel dat timorem pro vita conjugiali, vel dat favorem pro illa. 8. Audivi, quod amor polygamicus, et amor sexus, tum libido deflorationis, ac libido varietatis, quorundam animos in cupidinem ad iterata conjugia induxerint; ut et quorundum animos, timores legis et famae, si moechantur: praeter plura alia, quae inclinationes externas ad matrimonium promovent.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: sicut.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: sexus (absque puncto) </p>
