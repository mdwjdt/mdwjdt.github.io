<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第345节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>345、⑽一夫多妻就是淫乱。这是因为它的爱在数个当中被分割；它其实是两性情爱，就是属于外在人或属世人的爱，因而并非婚姻之爱，唯独婚姻之爱才是贞洁的。众所周知，一夫多妻的爱是在数个当中被分割的爱；被分割的爱并非婚姻之爱，因为后者是与一个异性不可分离的爱。所以，另一种爱是淫乱的，一夫多妻就是淫乱。一夫多妻之爱是两性情爱，与两性情爱唯一不同之处在于：一夫多妻者所娶女人的数量是有限的，他还受到为公众利益所制定的某些法律的约束，可以在数个妻子之外拥有情妇或妾室。一夫多妻之爱因是两性情爱，故是一种淫乱之爱。<br><br>一夫多妻之爱之所以是属于外在人或属世人的爱，是因为这爱被铭刻在属世人身上。凡属世人凭自己所行的，都是邪恶；他只有上升为内在属灵人才能从这恶中被引离出来，而这种事唯有主才能做到。在性方面，属世人与生俱来的邪恶就是淫荡。但淫荡破坏社会，于是，一个替代品取而代之被引入，这就是所谓的一夫多妻。人从父母出生所进入的一切邪恶被植入他的属世人，但其中没有一个邪恶能影响属灵人，因为他从主出生进入这属灵人。从此处所列举的理由和其它许多理由可以清楚看出，一夫多妻就是淫乱。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>345、（10）一夫多妻就是淫荡。这是因为爱被分成多个，因为它是对异性的爱，它是外在人或自然人的爱，而不是婚姻之爱。因为婚姻之爱是贞洁的。</p><p>人们知道一夫多妻中的爱是分给多个人的，被分割了的爱就不是婚姻之爱，因为婚姻之爱是不可以从异性中的一个那里分割的。因此一夫多妻就是淫荡。</p><p>一夫多妻中的爱是外在人或自然人的爱是因为它根植于自我之上。自我所做的开始都是罪恶的，人只有在被提升到内在的人和精神的人中时才可能摆脱这些罪恶，而这只有通过主才能办得到。对于异性，人生来的罪恶在这方面是淫荡的。但是因为淫荡是不利于社会的，所以一种与它相似的制度产生了，这就是一夫多妻制。（人生来的每种罪恶都是处于自我之中，而不存在于其精神性中，因为人的精神性来自于主）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #345 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>345. (x) Polygamy is wantonness.<p>This is because the love of it is divided among a number; it is sexual love, the love of the outward or natural man, so it is not conjugial love, which is the only chaste kind of love there is. It is well known that polygamous love is a love divided among a number; and a divided love is not conjugial love, for this is a love inseparable from one of the other sex. So the other kind of love is wanton, and polygamy is wantonness.<p>Polygamous love is sexual love, because it differs from sexual love only in being limited to the number of women a polygamist can take on. He is also bound by certain laws enacted for the public good, and he is allowed to have mistresses in addition to wives. So being sexual love, this is a love of wantonness.</p><p>[2] The reason why polygamous love is that of the outward or natural man is that this is imprinted on that man. Whatever the natural man does of himself is evil, and he can only be guided out of this by being raised to the inward, spiritual man, something only the Lord can do. The evil which concerns sex inherent in the natural man is fornication. But because this is destructive of society, a replica has been substituted for it, and this is called polygamy. Every evil a person inherits from his parents by birth is planted in his natural man; but none of this affects the spiritual man, because he acquires this by being born from the Lord. The reasons cited here and many others make it plain to see that polygamy is wantonness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #345 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>345. 10. Polygamy is lechery. Polygamy is lechery because the love in it is divided among more than one; because it is love for the opposite sex; and because it is a love of the external or natural man, and so is not conjugial love, which alone is chaste.<p>People know that polygamous love is love divided among more than one; and love divided is not conjugial love, for conjugial love is not divisible from one of the opposite sex. Therefore polygamous love is lecherous, and polygamy is lechery.<p>Polygamous love is love for the opposite sex, because it differs from it only in being limited to the number the polygamist can acquire, and in being subject to certain laws enacted for the public good; also in its being permitted to take concubines in addition to wives. And so, because it is love for the opposite sex, it is a love of lechery.</p><p>[2] Polygamous love is a love of the external or natural man, because it is engraved on the natural man. And whatever the natural man does of itself is evil, from which a person cannot be withdrawn except by elevation into the internal, spiritual man, which is accomplished only by the Lord. With respect to the opposite sex, the evil inherent in the natural man is licentiousness; but because this is destructive of society, instead of licentiousness a likeness of it was introduced, which is called polygamy. (Every evil into which a person is born from his parents is implanted in his natural self, but not any of it in his spiritual self, because he is born into this from the Lord.)<p>From the arguments presented and also many others, it can be plainly seen that polygamy is lechery. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #345 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>345. 10. Polygamy is lascivious. This is because its love is divided among more than one and is love of the other sex. It is also a superficial love, or love on man's worldly plane, and so it is not the love in marriage, which is the only chaste love.<p>It is well known that polygamous love is love divided among more than one. And a divided love is not the love in marriage, for you cannot separate this love from one person of the opposite sex.<p>So a divided love is lascivious, and polygamy is lascivious.<p>Polygamous love is love of the other sex because the only difference is that it is limited to the number of wives that the polygamist can get, and is held to whatever laws are passed for the public good. Also, it allows taking mistresses in addition to wives. And so, because it is love of the other sex, it is a lascivious love. Polygamous love is love on a person's outer plane or the plane of nature because it is etched on that part of a person. And whatever the worldly side of man does from itself is bad. He is only led away from this through being raised into his inner, spiritual person, which the Lord alone does. And the evil residing in the natural plane of a person, regarding a sex, is whoredom, but this destroys society, so something like whoredom - polygamy is introduced in its place. All the evil that a person is born into from his parents is implanted in his worldly level, but none of it in his spiritual level, because he is born into this by the Lord. On account of the reasons brought out, and also many others, you can see clearly that polygamy is lascivious. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #345 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>345. X. THAT POLYGAMY IS LASCIVIOUSNESS is because its love is divided among many and, being a love belonging to the external or natural man, is love of the sex and so is not conjugial love, which alone is chaste. That polygamous love is divided among many is well known; and divided love is not conjugial love, for the latter cannot be separated from the one of the sex. Hence a divided love is lascivious, and polygamy is lasciviousness. That polygamous love is love of the sex is because it differs therefrom only in being limited to the number which the polygamist can take, and in being held to certain laws laid down for the public good; also, in that it allows the addition of concubines to wives. Thus, being love of the sex, it is a love of lasciviousness.</p><p>[2] That polygamous love is a love belonging to the external or natural man is because it is inscribed on that man; and whatever the natural man does of himself is evil, nor is he led away from this evil except by elevation into the internal spiritual man, which is effected by the Lord alone. As regards the sex, the evil which is within the natural man is whoredom; and because this is destructive of society, therefore, in place of whoredom, its similitude was introduced which is called polygamy. All the evil into which a man is born from his parents is implanted in his natural man, but none in his spiritual man, for into this he is born from the Lord. From the reasons hitherto adduced, and from many others, it can be seen clearly that polygamy is lasciviousness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #345 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>345. (x) Polygamy is lasciviousness. For in polygamy love is divided among several; it is sexual love and a love of the external or natural man, and thus is not marital love, which alone occurs chaste. Every one knows that polygamous love is divided among a number; and a divided love is not marital love, for this is inseparable from one of the sex. Hence that love is lascivious, and polygamy is lasciviousness. Polygamous love is love for the sex, differing from it only in being limited to the number which the polygamist can attach to himself and in being conformed to certain laws imposed for the public good; also, in that it permits one to add concubines to wives. Being thus sexual love, it is a love of lasciviousness. Polygamous love is love of the external or natural man for the reason that it is inscribed on that man; and whatever the natural man does of himself is evil, from which he cannot be rescued except by being raised into the internal spiritual man, which is done by the Lord alone. The evil, as concerns sex, which inheres in the natural man, is whoredom; but as this is destructive of society, there was induced in place of it a likeness of it, which is polygamy. All evil into which a human being is born from his parents is implanted in his natural man, but none in his spiritual man, for into this he is born from the Lord. From what has been adduced and for many other reasons, too, it is plain that polygamy is lasciviousness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #345 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>345. (10) That polygamy is lasciviousness is because its love is divided among several, and is the love of the sex, and is a love of the external or natural man, and so is not conjugial love, which alone is chaste. That polygamous love is divided among several is known, and divided love is not conjugial love, which cannot be severed from the one of the sex. That love is therefore, lascivious, and polygamy is lasciviousness. That polygamous love is the love of the sex, is because it only differs from it in being limited to the number that the polygamist can take to himself, and in being held to certain laws established for the public good; also in that it permits the addition of concubines to wives. And being thus the love of the sex it is the love of lasciviousness. Polygamous love is a love of the external or natural man because it is inscribed on that man; and whatever the natural man does from himself is evil, out of which he cannot be led except by elevation into the internal spiritual man, which is done by the Lord alone. And the evil respecting the sex which inheres in the natural man is scortation; and because this is destructive of society, in place of scortation a similitude of it was introduced which is called polygamy. All the evil into which a man is born from his parents is implanted in his natural man, but none in the spiritual man, because into this he is born from the Lord. From the reasons that have been adduced, and from many others also, it may be seen clearly that polygamy is lasciviousness. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #345 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>345. X: Quod Polygamia sit lascivia, est quia ejus amor est divisus inter plures, et est amor sexus, estque amor externi seu naturalis hominis, et sic non est amor conjugialis, qui unice datur castus. Quod amor polygamicus sit amor divisus inter plures, notum est, ac amor divisus non est amor conjugialis, est enim hic amor ab una e sexu non dividuus; inde ille amor est lascivus, et Polygamia est lascivia. Quod amor polygamicus sit amor sexus, est quia ab hoc differt solummodo, quod sit limitatus ad numerum, quem Polygamus potest adsciscere; et quod adstrictus sit ad quasdam leges propter Bonum publicum latas; tum quod liceat superinducere pellices uxoribus; et sic quia est amor sexus, est amor lasciviae.</p><p>[2] Quod amor polygamicus sit amor externi seu naturalis hominis, est quia illi homini inscriptus est; et quicquid naturalis homo ex se agit, est malum, a quo non educitur nisi per elevationem in internum spiritualem hominem, quod fit solum a Domino; ac malum spectans sexum, quod naturali homini inest, est scortatio; at quia haec pessumdat Societatem, loco scortationis inducta est similitudo ejus, quae vocatur polygamia: omne malum, in quod homo ex parentibus nascitur, naturali ejus homini implantatur, non autem aliquid Spirituali homini, quia in hunc nascitur a Domino. Ex allatis et quoque ex pluribus aliis rationibus evidenter videri potest, quod Polygamia sit lascivia. </p>
