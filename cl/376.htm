<h4 align="center"></h4><p>376、⑾有些情况下根本没有嫉妒，这同样出于各种原因。没有嫉妒，或不再嫉妒的原因有很多。尤其那些认为婚姻之爱并不比淫乱之爱高贵，同时没有尊严，视好名声如草芥之人，是没有嫉妒的。这些人和有老婆的皮条客差不多。那些出于以下信念拒绝嫉妒的人也没有嫉妒，即：嫉妒让人心烦意乱，看守妻子是没用的；看守她等于煽动她，所以，最好两眼一闭，甚至也别透过门眼去看，免得发现什么。有些人拒绝嫉妒是怕背上嫉妒的恶名，认为男人身为一个男人，就应该无所畏惧。有些人被迫拒绝嫉妒，是唯恐他们的家庭事务遭到破坏，或唯恐妻子被指控淫荡的罪名后，他们会招致公众的责难。此外，有些人由于缺乏性能力，或为了要孩子继承家产而纵容妻子；有些人则是为了利益等等，这类人的嫉妒会逐渐减退，直到完全消失。还有一些淫乱的婚姻，在这种婚姻中，夫妻彼此同意对方纵情云雨；然而，他们互相见面时，仍能摆出一副彬彬有礼的面孔。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #376 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>376. (xi) In some cases there may be no jealousy at all, again for a number of reasons.<p>There are many reasons for an absence of jealousy or for it ceasing to exist. In particular jealousy is unknown to those who rate conjugial love no higher than scortatory love, and at the same time have no pride, reckoning their reputation as worthless. These are not very different from pimps with wives. Jealousy is also absent in the case of those who have rejected it out of a conviction that it damages the disposition, and it is useless to keep a wife under control, and if she is kept under control, this encourages her; so that it is preferable to keep one's eyes shut, and not even to peep through the key-hole in a door, in case visual proof is disclosed.<p>Some people have rejected jealousy because of the stigma its name carries, thinking that a man who is a man should fear nothing. Some have been driven to reject it, for fear of ruining their households, or of incurring abuse outside the house, if the wife is convicted of the lust of which she is guilty. Moreover, jealousy is reduced to zero in the case of those who allow their wives licence because of loss of potency, or for the sake of having children so as to leave heirs, in some cases also for profit, and so on. There are also scortatory marriages, in which the couple mutually agree to allow the other to indulge in making love, while they still put a civil face on their conduct when they meet. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #376 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>376. 11. Some people do not have any jealousness in them, also for a variety of reasons. There are a number of reasons for jealousness being non-existent and for jealousness ceasing.<p>Jealousness is non-existent especially in people who make conjugial love of no more account than licentious love, and who are at the same time without honor, placing no value in their reputation and name. They are not unlike married pimps.<p>Jealousness is non-existent also in those who have rejected it out of a conviction that it only torments the mind, that it is useless to stand guard over a wife, that to stand guard over her simply goads her on, and that it is better therefore to close one's eyes and not even peek through the keyhole in the door lest something be visibly detected. Others have rejected jealousness because of the stigma attached to the attribution of jealousness, thinking that a man who is a man feels no fear. Still others have been compelled to reject it to keep their domestic affairs from being ruined, and to avoid becoming the subject of public reproach if they were to accuse their wives of the wantonness they are guilty of.<p>In addition, jealousness becomes gradually non-existent in men who grant their wives license to have lovers because of a failure of their own virility, in order to have children to become their heirs; in some cases, too, for the sake of gain; and so on.<p>There are also licentious marriages, in which by mutual consent they are both granted license to have affairs, and who yet maintain a civil countenance when they encounter each other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #376 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>376. 11. Some people do not have any jealousy, also for various reasons.<p>The reasons for no jealousy and ceasing jealousy are several. Those with no jealousy are mainly those who make no more of married love than of fornication and also are not famous, valuing the reputation of their name as a trifle. They are not unlike married pimps. Also without jealousy are those who scorn it from a sense that it disturbs your mind and that it is useless to guard a wife, and she becomes aroused if guarded, so it is better to shut your eyes and not even look through the keyhole in the door, so as not to uncover anything by seeing it. Others scorn it because of malicious talk about the name "jealousy," thinking that a man who is a man has nothing to fear. Others are forced to reject it so as not to ruin their household affairs and so as not to be blamed in public if a wife who is lustful is exposed. Moreover, jealousy fades to nothing in men who give their wives permission because they lack potency, for the purpose of raising children as heirs, and also in some on account of making money, and so on. There are also adulterous marriages where by mutual consent both give permission for sexual intercourse and still meet each other with a friendly face. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #376 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>376. XI. THAT WITH SOME THERE IS NO JEALOUSY, AND THIS ALSO FROM VARIOUS CAUSES. There are many causes of an absence of jealousy and of a cessation of jealousy. Those especially have no jealousy who make conjugial love to be of no more account than scortatory love, and who at the same time are inglorious, counting a good reputation as of no value. They are not unlike married pimps. Those also have no jealousy who have put it away from a confirmed belief that it troubles the mind and that it is useless to keep watch on a wife; that if watched she is incited, and that therefore it is preferable to shut one's eyes and not even set them looking through the keyhole lest something be detected by the sight. Some have put it away on account of the stigma attached to the name jealousy, thinking that a man who is a man fears nothing. Some have been driven to put it away lest their domestic affairs be ruined, and also, lest they incur public censure were the wife to be convicted of the lewdness of which she is guilty. Furthermore, With men who, being themselves impotent, grant license to their wives in order to raise up children for the sake of their inheritance; also with men who do this for the sake of gain, and so on, jealousy recedes until it wholly disappears. There are also scortatory marriages in which, by mutual consent, both parties are given license to practice venery; yet they meet each other with a civil countenance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #376 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>376. (xi) Some feel no jealousy at all, which, is also from various causes. The absence or cessation of jealousy has many causes. Those especially feel no jealousy who rate marital love no better than scortatory and also are disreputable, with no good name to consider. They are not unlike married pimps. Those, too, feel no jealousy who have banished it, believing that it infests the mind, and that it is vain to guard the wife, or that to guard her is to instigate her, and that it is more satisfactory therefore to shut the eyes and not let them so much as spy through a key-hole lest something be seen. Some have banished jealousy because of the stigma attached to the name of jealousy, thinking that a man who is a man has no fear. Some have been driven to cast it aside lest the domestic life be ruined, also not to incur the public censure which would be theirs if the wife were accused and convicted of wantonness. Jealousy also declines to none at all with those who concede their wives license because of the loss of virility, or for the procreation of children to keep the line alive, or, in instances, for the sake of profit; and so on. There are also scortatory marriages, in which the partners grant each other license in venery, and yet meet each other civilly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #376 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>376. (11) That with some there is no jealousy, also from various causes. There are many causes of no jealousy, and of the cessation of jealousy. They especially have no jealousy who make no more of conjugial love than of scortatory love, and who are at once of no honor, setting no value upon a good name. They are not unlike married pimps. They also have no jealousy who have put it away, from an established notion that it infests the mind, and that a wife is watched in vain, and if watched is incited; and therefore, that it is better to shut one's eyes, and not even let them look through the key-hole in the door lest something be detected by sight. Some have put it away on account of the stigma attached to the name jealousy, -thinking that a man who is a man fears nothing. Some have been driven to put it away lest their domestic affairs be ruined, so also lest they incur public disparagement if the wife should be convicted of the lewdness whereof she is guilty. Besides, jealousy passes away to nothing with those who grant free license to their wives, on account of impotence, for the procreation of children, for the sake of inheritance, and with some for gain, and so on. There are also scortatory marriages, in which by mutual consent license in venery is given to each, and yet they meet each other with civil countenance. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #376 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>376. XI. Quod apud quosdam non sit aliqua Zelotypia, etiam ex variis causis. Causae nullius Zelotypiae, et cessantis Zelotypiae, sunt plures: nulla Zelotypia est imprimis illis, qui amorem conjugialem non pluris faciunt quam scortatorium, et simul inglorii sunt, nauci pendentes nominis famam; hi non absimiles sunt uxoratis lenonibus. Nulla Zelotypia est quoque illis, qui illam rejecerunt ex confirmatione quod infestet animum, quodque in vanum custodiatur uxor, et quod si custoditur, incitetur, et quod ideo satius sit oculos occludere, et ne quidem per foramen clavis in janua immittere illos, ne aliquid visualiter detegatur: aliqui rejecerunt illam ex calumnia imposita nomini Zelotypiae, cogitantes quod vir qui vir nihil timeat: aliqui adacti sunt ad rejiciendum illam, ne res domesticae pessumdentur, tum ne in forensia vituperia incidat, si uxor libidinis, cujus rea est, argueretur. Praeterea Zelotypia <sup>1</sup>abscedit in nullam apud illos, qui uxoribus concedunt licentiam propter defectum potentiae; propter procreationem liberorum haereditatis causa; tum apud aliquos propter quaestus; et sic porro. Dantur etiam conjugia scortatoria, in quibus ex mutuo consensu utrique datur veneris licentia, et tamen facie civili sibi obviant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: Zolotypia </p>
