<h4 align="center"></h4><p>54、关于死后夫妻的状况，还需补充以下内容：<br><br>①死后，所有纯属世的夫妻都会分开。原因在于，他们对婚姻的爱是冷淡的，对奸淫的爱则是热情的。尽管如此，分开之后，他们有时仍像夫妻那样与别人交往，然而，过不了多长时间，他们就会彼此分开。这种情形屡屡发生；最终，这样的男人会屈从于某个荡妇，而这样的女人则屈从于某个奸夫，地狱的监牢会发生这种情况（如《揭秘启示录》153节第10段所描述的那样）。在那里，滥交是被禁止的，否则，必遭受痛苦的惩罚。<br><br>②若其中一个配偶是属灵的，而另一个是属世的，死后他们也会分开。属灵的配偶会被赐予一个合适的丈夫或妻子，而属世的配偶则被逐出，加入淫乱之地的同类当中。<br><br>③然而，对于在世时过着单身生活，并且毫无结婚意愿之人而言，他们若是属灵的，则依旧保持单身；但若是属世的，就会变成私通者。不过，若单身者渴望结婚，情况就不同了；他们若不断寻求婚姻，却未能如愿，更是如此。这类人若是属灵的，等到进入天堂后，他们会被赐予幸福婚姻。<br><br>④那些在世时被关在修道院的人，无论未婚的女人还是男人，死后等到修道士的生活持续一段时间后，就会从其誓言当中解脱出来，并被释放。他们会获得满足其渴望的自由，无论他们想不想过婚姻生活。他们若愿意，就会结婚；若不愿意，则被直接送到天堂边缘的单身者那里。不过，那些充满被禁止的淫欲之人则被丢了下去。<br><br>⑤单身者生活在天堂的边缘，因为永久的独身氛围会干扰婚姻之爱的氛围，而婚姻之爱的氛围是天堂的基本氛围，因它源于主与教会的天堂婚姻。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>54、关于婚姻中的夫妻在死后的情况还需要补充以下：</p><p>1、仅仅是自然的婚姻中的夫妻在死后互相分离。原因是他们的对婚姻的爱是冷淡的，而对婚外情的爱却是热衷的。然而，这些人在与原来的配偶相分离后有时还会与别人结成伴侣，但过一段时间后他们会互相分离。这种情况常常反复发生。最终，这样的男人与淫荡的女人相联系，女人与一些奸夫相联，这种情况存在于地狱中。在那里这种杂乱的关系做为一种惩罚而被禁止。</p><p>2、当夫妻双方中一者是有灵性的，而另一者是自然的时，他们在死后也彼此分离。有灵性的一方会有一个合适的伴侣，而另一方则会与一个与他（她）相似的只看重色欲的配偶在一起。</p><p>3、另外，在世间独身主义者，若他是有灵性的，他死后还会是独身。若他是自然人，那死后他就会成为放荡者。</p><p>与此不同的是，若他们在世间追求婚姻但却没有成功，那么在死后他会有一个美好的婚姻。</p><p>4、那些在世间时做修道士或修女的人，未婚的男人和女人，在死后他们的僧侣生活继续存在一段时间。一段时间后他们会被从修道院或寺院中放出来，获得自由，若愿意他们可组成婚姻。若不愿意组成婚姻，他们就会与其它的独身者一起处于天堂的一边。那些渴望色欲的人则被打入地狱。</p><p>5、独身者存在于天堂的一边的原因是独身的氛围会影响婚姻之爱，婚姻之爱是天堂中的重要氛围，这是因为它来自于主和教会神圣的结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #54 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>54. The following points need to be added to what has so far been reported about the state of married couples after death.<p>(a) All married partners who are only natural are parted after death. This is because their love of marriage is cold, and their love of adultery is warm. Still after parting, they sometimes associate with other like couples, but after a short while they leave each other. This often happens repeatedly. At length a man is made subservient to some slut, and a woman to some adulterer; this happens in the prison of hell (described in <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153</a> <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153[1-12]</a>[10]), where promiscuous fornication is forbidden on pain of punishment.<p>(b) If one of a couple is spiritual and the other natural, they too are parted after death. The spiritual one is given a suitable partner, but the natural one is banished to join similar spirits in lewd surroundings.<p>(c) Those, however, who lived unmarried in the world putting all idea of marrying far from their minds, remain unmarried, if they are spiritual. But if they are natural they become fornicators. It is different if unmarried people have longed to get married, and even more so if they have kept seeking to get married without success. If such people are spiritual, blessed marriages are found for them, but not until they reach heaven.<p>(d) Those who were confined to monastic institutions in the world, young women as well as men, are after living the life of a monk, which continues for some time after death, freed from their vows and allowed out. They achieve the freedom to satisfy their longings, whether they want to live in a marriage or not. If they do, they can; if not, they are directed to the unmarried on the fringe of heaven. But those inflamed with impermissible lust are cast down.<p>(e) The unmarried live on the fringe of heaven, because the sphere of perpetual celibacy is repulsive to the sphere of conjugial love, the sphere of heaven itself. This is because it comes down from the heavenly marriage of the Lord and the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #54 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>54. To what we have related so far about the state of married partners after death, we should add the following:<p>1. All those married partners who are merely natural, separate after death. The reason is that the love of being married is cold in them, and a love for committing adultery warm. Nevertheless, following that separation they still sometimes form associations with others as married partners, although after a short time they part from each other. Quite often this happens repeatedly, with one person after another. And finally the man is handed over to some licentious woman, and the woman to some adulterer, which takes place in a prison in hell (as described in <a href="../ar/153.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed, no. 153</a>, paragraph 10). There, promiscuous licentiousness is forbidden to both under pain of punishment.</p><p>[2] 2. When one partner is spiritual and the other natural, they, too, separate after death, and a suitable husband or wife is given to the spiritual partner, while the natural one is consigned to his or her like in places of lasciviousness.</p><p>[3] 3. Moreover, in the case of people who lived a celibate life in the world and completely turned their minds away from marriage, if they are spiritual, they remain celibate. But if they are natural, they become licentious.<p>It is different, however, if during their unmarried state they had wanted to marry, and still more if they had sought marriage without success. If these people are spiritual, they are provided blessed marriages, though not before they come into heaven.</p><p>[4] 4. In the case of people who in the world were shut away in convents and monasteries, both unmarried women and men, their cloistered life continues for some period of time after death. At the end of this time they are released and let go, and they gain the desired freedom they had prayed for, either to live married, if they wish, or not. If they wish to marry, they become married. If not, they are conveyed to other celibates at the side of heaven. Those who burned with forbidden lust, however, are cast down.</p><p>[5] 5. The reason celibates live at the side of heaven is because the atmosphere of permanent celibacy disturbs the atmosphere of conjugial love, which is the essential atmosphere of heaven. The atmosphere of conjugial love is the essential atmosphere of heaven because it descends from the heavenly marriage of the Lord and the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #54 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>54. The following things should be added to what I have mentioned so far about what happens to married people after death.<p>(a) All the couples who are merely worldly are separated after death. The reason is that their love for marriage cools off and their love of adultery warms up. Yet after separation they sometimes still form relationships like marriages with others, but after a short time they separate themselves from one another.<p>This often happens repeatedly. And finally the man is left to some prostitute and the woman to some adulterer. This takes place in prison in hell (see <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153</a> <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153[1-12]</a> <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153[1-12]</a> <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153[1-12]</a> [10]). They are both forbidden promiscuous lechery.<p>(b) When one partner is spiritual and the other worldly, they too are separated after death, and the spiritual one gets a suitable spouse, but the worldly one is banished among his own kind in places of promiscuity.<p>(c) But those who were single in the world and kept marriage completely out of their minds stay single, if they are spiritual. But if they are worldly they become lechers. It is different for those who longed for marriage while single, especially people who tried unsuccessfully to marry. If they are spiritual they are provided with happy marriages, but not until they are in heaven.<p>(d) People who have been shut up in monasteries in the world, virgins and men, are released and set free after their monastic life ends (it goes on a while after death), and they gain the freedom to do things they wanted to, whether they wanted to be married or not. If they did, they do get married. If not, they are taken to the celibates, to one side of heaven. But those who constantly smoldered with lust are expelled.<p>(e) There is a reason why the celibates are to one side of heaven. The aura of complete celibacy disturbs the aura of marriage love, which is the very aura of heaven. It is the very aura of heaven because it comes down from the heavenly marriage of the Lord and the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #54 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>54. To what has been related thus far respecting the state of married partners after death should be added the following: 1. All married partners who are merely natural are separated after death, for the reason that with them the love of marriage grows cold, and the love of adultery warm. Yet, after separation they sometimes consociate as married partners with others, but after a short time they mutually separate. Frequently this is done again and again, until at last the man is given up to some harlot and the woman to some adulterer. This takes place in an infernal prison where promiscuous whoredom is forbidden to both under penalty; respecting this, see THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED, no. <a href="../ar/153.htm">153</a>. 2. Married partners, one of whom is spiritual and the other natural, are also separated after death, and to the spiritual is given a suitable partner; but the natural is relegated to his or her like, in places of lasciviousness. 3. Those who in the world have lived unmarried and have wholly estranged their minds from marriage, if they are spiritual, remain single, but if natural, become whoremongers. It is different with those who, in their single state, have desired marriage, and still more with those who have solicited it without success. For them, if they are spiritual, blessed marriages are provided, though not until they are in heaven. 4. Those, both virgins and men, who in the world have been shut up in monasteries, at the conclusion of their monastic life, which continues for some time after death, are set free and discharged. They then enjoy the longed-for liberty of their desires, as to whether they wish to live a conjugial life or not. If they desire a conjugial life, they obtain it; if not, they are conveyed to those who live in celibacy at the side of heaven; but those who have burned with forbidden lust are cast down. 5. The reason why celibates are at the side of heaven is because the sphere of perpetual celibacy infests the sphere of conjugial love, which is the sphere of heaven. That the sphere of conjugial love is the sphere of heaven, is because it descends from the heavenly marriage of the Lord and the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #54 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>54. To what has been said so far about the state of partners after death, let these items be added:<p>1. All partners who are merely natural separate after death, for the reason that the love of marriage is cold with them and the love of adultery warm. After separation they do sometimes associate themselves with others as married partners, but in a short time they leave each other. This may happen repeatedly, but finally the man is released to a whore, and the woman to an adulterer, which takes place in an infernal prison, where promiscuous whoredom is forbidden to each under penalty (see <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153</a> <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153[1-12]</a>[2], <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153</a> <a href="../ar/153.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 153[1-12]</a>[10])<p>2. Partners, of whom one is spiritual and the other natural, also separate after death, and there is given the spiritual a suitable partner, but the natural partner is relegated to his like in places of lasciviousness. (<a href="3.htm">3</a>)<p>3. Those, however, who lived single in the world and who altogether alienated the mind from marriage, if they are spiritual, remain single; if natural, they become whoremongers. But otherwise those who in their bachelorhood wished marriage, and still more those who sought it unsuccessfully. Blessed marriages are provided them, if they are spiritual, but not before they are in heaven. (<a href="4.htm">4</a>)<p>4. Those who were immured in monasteries in the world, young women as well as men, after a stated period of monastic life after death, are discharged and released, and gain the liberty they have craved for their desires, whether they wish to live married or not: if married, they become so; if not, they are carried to the celibate at the side of heaven; but those who burned with unlawful lust, are cast down. (<a href="5.htm">5</a>)<p>5. The celibate are at the side of heaven because the sphere of perpetual celibacy infests the sphere of marital love, which is heaven's own sphere. The sphere of marital love is heaven's own sphere because marital love descends from the heavenly marriage of the Lord and the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #54 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>54. To what has been related thus far respecting the state of married partners after death, the following is to be added: (1) That all the married who are merely natural are separated after death; for the reason that the love of marriage grows cold with them and the love of adultery grows warm. And yet after separation they sometimes associate themselves with others as consorts. But in a brief time they mutually part; and frequently this is done again and again, until at length the man is given up to some harlot, and the woman to some adulterer, which takes place in an infernal prison where promiscuous scortation is interdicted to both, under punishment. On which subject see the Apocalypse Revealed n. 153 (10). (2) Married partners, one of whom is spiritual and the other natural, are also separated after death, and to the spiritual a suitable partner is given; but the natural is relegated to his like in the resorts of lasciviousness. (3) But they who in the world lived unmarried, and altogether estranged their minds from marriage, if they are spiritual, remain single; but if natural they become whoremongers (scortatores). <sup >1</sup>But it is different with those who in their single state have desired marriage, and still more with those who without success have solicited marriage; for them, if they are spiritual, blessed marriages are provided - but not until they are in heaven. (4) They who in the world were shut up in monasteries, both virgins and men, at the close of their monastic life - which continues for some time after death - are released and allowed to go free, and gain the wished - for liberty of their desires, whether they would live a married life or not. If they desire marriage they are married; if not they are taken to those who live in celibacy at the side of heaven. But those that are inflamed with forbidden lust are cast down. (5) The reason why the celibates are at the side of heaven is, that the sphere of perpetual celibacy infests the sphere of conjugial love, which is the very sphere of heaven. The sphere of conjugial love is the very sphere of heaven because it descends from the heavenly marriage of the Lord and the church.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In Conjugial Love, we see that: 'By scortatory love is meant a love of adultery which destroys conjugial love,' n. 424. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #54 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>54. His, quae hactenus de Statu conjugum post mortem memorata sunt, addenda sunt haec. 1. Quod omnes illi Conjuges, qui mere naturales sunt, separentur post mortem; causa est, quia amor conjugii apud illos friget, et amor adulterii calet; at usque post separationem quandoque se cum aliis sicut conjuges consociant, sed post breve tempus a se invicem recedunt; quod saepius fit vicibus iteratis; et tandem emancipatur vir alicui scorto, et foemina alicui adultero, quod fit in Carcere infernali, de quo in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_54/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_153" target=_top>Apocalypsis Revelata 153</a> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_54/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_153" target=_top>Apocalypsis Revelata 153[1-12]</a>. p. X, ubi utrique sub poena interdicitur scortatio promiscua. <p>[2] 2. Conjuges, quorum unus est spiritualis et alter naturalis, post mortem etiam separantur, et datur Spirituali conjux conveniens, at Naturalis relegatur in loca lasciviae ad similes. <p>[3] 3. Illi autem, qui in Mundo coelebes vixerunt, ac prorsus abalienaverunt mentem a conjugio, si spirituales sunt, manent coelebes; si autem naturales, fiunt scortatores. Aliter vero illi qui in suo Coelibatu desideraverunt conjugium, et plus qui absque successu sollicitaverunt illud; his, si spirituales sunt, Conjugia beata providentur; sed non prius, quam dum in coelo sunt. <p>[4] 4. Illi qui in Mundo monasteriis inclusi sunt, tam virgines quam viri, post exactam vitam monasterialem, quae perstat aliquo spatio temporis post mortem, exsolvuntur et emittuntur, ac potiuntur libertate votiva desideriorum suorum, sive velint conjugiales vivere, sive non; si conjugiales, fiunt, si non, feruntur ad coelebes a latere coeli; at qui aestuaverunt inconcessa libidine, dejiciuntur. <p>[5] 5. Quod Coelebes sint a latere coeli, est quia sphaera perpetui coelibatus infestat sphaeram amoris conjugialis, quae est ipsa sphaera coeli; quod sphaera amoris conjugialis sit ipsa sphaera coeli, est quia descendit ex coelesti Conjugio Domini et Ecclesiae. </p>
