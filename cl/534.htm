<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第534节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>534、此后，我和天使交谈说：“其实主还向世人揭示了一件事。”“是什么？”他们问；我回答说：“关于真正的婚姻之爱及其属天的快乐。”天使说：“谁不知道婚姻之爱的快乐胜过其它所有爱的快乐？谁看不出，主所能赐下的一切祝福、幸福和快乐都汇集到某种爱中？它们的容器就是真正的婚姻之爱，这爱能以丰满的感觉接受并感知它们。”我回答说：“人们之所以没有意识到这一点，是因为他们没有靠近主，并照祂的诫命生活，即：避恶如罪并行出善事。真正的婚姻之爱及其快乐唯独来自主，被赐给那些照祂诫命生活的人。”因此，它被赐给那些将要被接入《启示录》“新耶路撒冷”所指的主的新教会之人。对此，我补充说：“我怀疑当今世人是否愿意相信这爱本身是一种属灵之爱，因而来源于宗教，因为他们对于这爱的观念纯粹是肉体的。”这时，天使对我说：“把它写下来吧，继续启示。然后，关于这个主题所写的书会从天上降下，我们必看到它的内容是否被接受；同时，也必看到他们是否愿意承认，人照其宗教而拥有这爱，以致它对属灵者来说，是属灵的，对属世者来说，是属世的，对奸淫者来说，则纯是肉体的。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>534、之后我又与天使讲还有一些东西也被揭示于世了。天使问是什么。我回答道：“关于真正的婚姻之爱及其快乐。”</p><p>天使说：“有谁不知道婚姻之爱的快乐超越其它一切快乐呢？”有谁不知道有些爱能集中所有的祝福并得到主的赞同。通过真正的婚姻之爱才能接受到这些并完全感受到。”</p><p>我答道人们并不知道，因为他们不跟随主并按主的十诫生活。不抗拒罪恶并行善。因为真正的婚姻之爱只被赋予那些按主的的十诫生活的人。赋予那些进入到主的新教会中的人。即《启示录》中所说的新耶路撒冷。</p><p>我补充说，我不确定是否如今的人愿意相信这种爱是精神性的，并来自于宗教。因为如今的人对它的认识处于躯体基础上。</p><p>此时天使对我说：“写下来吧，然后我们将你写的书从天国中散布出去。然后我们就会看到它是否能被接受，会看到是否人们承认这种爱是与人的宗教性，精神性，自然性相联。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #534 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>534. After this I talked with the angels about another revelation being made by the Lord in the world. 'What is that?' they asked. 'About truly conjugial love and its heavenly delights,' I said. 'Is there anyone,' said the angels, 'who does not know that the delights of conjugial love surpass the delights of all other loves? Can anyone fail to see that all the blessedness, bliss and pleasures that the Lord can ever bestow are gathered into a love; and their container is truly conjugial love, which can receive and feel them to the full?'<p>I replied that people are unaware of this, because they have not approached the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments, shunning evils as sins and doing good deeds. Truly conjugial love together with its delights comes solely from the Lord, and is granted to those who live in accordance with His commandments. So it is granted to those who are to be received into the Lord's new church meant by 'the New Jerusalem' in the Book of Revelation. To this I added that I was doubtful whether people in the world today are willing to believe that this love is in essence a spiritual love, and is thus derived from religion, because of the notion they have of it as being merely bodily.<p>Then they said to me, 'Write on this subject, and continue the revelation, and afterwards the book written on the subject will be sent down from heaven, and we shall see whether its contents are received; and at the same time, whether they are willing to acknowledge that people possess this love in accordance with their religion, so that it is spiritual with the spiritual, natural with the natural, and simply fleshly with adulterers.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #534 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>534. I afterwards spoke again with the angels, saying that something else had been revealed in the world by the Lord. When they asked what it was, I said, "Respecting truly conjugial love and its heavenly delights."<p>"Who does not know," the angels said, "that the delights of conjugial love surpass the delights of all other loves? And who cannot see that into some love have been gathered all the blessings, felicities and delights that could ever be conferred by the Lord, and that their receptacle is truly conjugial love, which is able to receive and perceive them to a full sensation of them?"<p>I replied that they did not know this, because they did not go to the Lord and live according to His commandments, refraining from evils as sins and doing good. For truly conjugial love with its delights comes solely from the Lord and is given to those who live according to His commandments. Thus it is given to those who are received into the Lord's New Church, I said, the church that is meant in the book of Revelation by the New Jerusalem.<p>To this I added that I was uncertain whether people in the world today would be willing to believe that this love in itself is a spiritual love and thus stems from religion, because they harbor only a fleshly idea of it.<p>At that the angels said to me, "Write about it and pursue the revelation; and afterwards we will take the book you have written on the subject and let it descend from heaven. Then we shall see whether the points it contains are received, including at the same time whether people are willing to acknowledge that the character of this love is in accordance with the religion in a person, spiritual in the spiritual, natural in the natural, and merely carnal in adulterers." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #534 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>534. After this I discussed with the angels something else the Lord revealed in the world.<p>"What is it?" they said.<p>I said, "It has to do with the real love in marriage and its celestial joy."<p>The angels said, "Who doesn't know that the joy of married love surpasses the joy of all other loves? And who can't see that all blessings, happiness, and enjoyments that the Lord could ever bestow are gathered in that love, and that real married love is what receives them? It can receive them and feel them fully."<p>I answered that they do not know this, because they have not approached the Lord and lived according to His teachings, avoiding evils as sins and doing good things. And the real love in marriage, with its joys, is only from the Lord and is given to those who live by His teachings - that is, it is given to those who are received into the Lord's new church, which is what is meant by the "New Jerusalem" in the Book of Revelation.<p>I added to this that I am doubtful that they want to believe, in the world today, that this love is a spiritual love in its own right and therefore comes from religion, because they foster a notion about it that is purely physical.<p>Then they said to me, "Write about it and complete the revelation, and then we'll drop the book written about it down from heaven, and we'll see if they accept the things that are in it. And we'll also see if they want to acknowledge that this love is in keeping with the religion in a person - spiritual in spiritual people, worldly in worldly people, and purely physical in adulterers." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #534 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>534. After this I spoke with the angels and said, "In the world yet one more thing is revealed by the Lord." "What is that?" they asked, and I answered: "Concerning love truly conjugial and its heavenly delights." The angels then said: "Who does not know that the delights of conjugial love exceed the delights of all other loves? and who cannot see that there is some love into which are gathered all the blessedness, happiness, and delight that can ever be conferred by the Lord? and that the receptacle of these is love truly conjugial?--a love which can receive and perceive them with fullness of sensation."<p>I answered: "Men do not know this because they have not approached the Lord and lived according to His commandments by shunning evils as sins and doing goods; and love truly conjugial with its delights is solely from the Lord, and is given to those who live according to His commandments. Thus it is given to those who are received into the Lord's New Church, which is meant in the Apocalypse by the New Jerusalem." To this I added: "I am in doubt whether at this day men in the world are willing to believe that in itself this love is a spiritual love and therefore has its existence from religion, for they cherish only a corporeal idea concerning it."<p>The angels then said to me: "Write about it, and follow the revelation. The written book shall then be let down by us out of heaven and we shall see whether what is written therein is received, and at the same time, whether men are willing to acknowledge that this love is with man according to his religion--spiritual with the spiritual, natural with the natural, and merely carnal with adulterers." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #534 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>534. After this I told the angels that one thing else is revealed in the world by the Lord.<p>"What is that?" they asked.<p>I said, "Something about true marital love and its heavenly delights."<p>The angels said, "Who does not know that the delights of marital love surpass the delights of all other loves? Who cannot see that all the blessedness, satisfaction and delight which can ever be conferred by the Lord are brought together into some love? And that the receptacle of those states is true marital love, which can receive and perceive them even to full sensation?"<p>I answered that men do not know this because they have not approached the Lord and lived according to His commandments, shunning evils as sins, and doing good. True marital love with its delights is from the Lord alone, and is given to those who live according to His commandments. It is given to those, therefore, who are received into the Lord's new Church, which is meant by "the New Jerusalem" in the Apocalypse. I added that I am in doubt whether men in the world are willing today to believe that this love is in itself a spiritual love and hence is from religion, for the reason that they cherish only a corporeal idea concerning it.<p>They then said to me, "Write about it and follow out the revelation. We shall then let the book written about it down out of heaven, and shall see whether men receive the things in it, and at the same time whether they are willing to acknowledge that this love is of a piece with a man's religion, spiritual with the spiritual, natural with the natural, and merely carnal with adulterers." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #534 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>534. After this I spoke with the angels, and said that yet another thing is revealed in the world by the Lord.<p>They asked, 'What is it?' I said, 'Respecting love truly conjugial, and its heavenly delights.'<p>The angels said, 'Who does not know that the delights of conjugial love excel the delights of all other loves? And who cannot see that into some love are brought together all the states of blessedness, satisfaction, and delight that can ever be conferred by the Lord? And that the receptacle of these is love truly conjugial, which can receive and perceive them even to full sensation.' I answered, 'That men do not know this, because they have not come to the Lord, and lived according to His commandments, by shunning evils as sins, and doing good, and love truly conjugial with its delights is from the Lord only, and is given to those that live according to His commandments. That thus it is given to those who are received into the New Church of the Lord, which is meant by 'the New Jerusalem' in the Apocalypse. To this I added that I am in doubt whether at this day in the world they are willing to believe that this is in itself a spiritual love, and is therefore, from religion, for the reason that they cherish only a corporeal idea of it.'<p>They then said to me, 'Write about it, and follow the revelation. And afterwards the book written about it shall be let down by us out of heaven, and we shall see whether the things therein are received, and at the same time whether they are willing to acknowledge that this love is according to religion with man, spiritual with the spiritual, natural with the natural, and merely carnal with adulterers.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #534 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>534. Post haec loquutus sum cum Angelis, quod adhuc aliquid reveletur in Mundo a Domino; quaesiverunt, quid hoc; dixi, "de Amore vere Conjugiali, et de Coelestibus ejus delitiis;" dixerunt Angeli, "quis non scit, quod delitiae Amoris conjugialis excedant delitias omnium amorum; et quis non potest videre, quod in aliquem amorem collatae sint omnes beatitudines, faustitates et jucunditates, quae usquam conferri possunt a Domino, et quod receptaculum illarum sit amor vere conjugialis, qui ad plenum sensum potest illas recipere et percipere:" respondi, quod hoc non sciant, quia non adiverunt Dominum, et vixerunt secundum praecepta Ipsius fugiendo mala ut peccata, et faciendo bona; et Amor vere conjugialis cum suis delitiis unice est a Domino, et datur illis qui vivunt secundum praecepta Ipsius; ita quod detur illis, qui recipiuntur in Novam Domini Ecclesiam, quae in Apocalypsi per Novam Hierosolymam intelligitur. His addidi, quod in dubio sim, num velint in Mundo hodie credere, quod ille Amor in se sit Amor spiritualis, et inde ex Religione, ex causa, quia de illo fovent modo ideam corpoream; tunc dixerunt ad me, "scribe de illo, et sequere revelationem, et postea Liber de illo scriptus demittetur a nobis e Coelo, et videbimus num recipiantur illa quae inibi sunt; et simul num velint agnoscere, quod ille Amor sit secundum Religionem apud hominem, spiritualis apud spirituales, naturalis apud naturales, et mere carnalis apud adulteros." </p>
