<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第103节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>103、对此，我补充两个记事。记事一：<br><br>日出前的一天清晨，我朝灵界东方望去，只见四个骑马人仿佛从闪耀着黎明火光的云层中飞出来。他们头戴冠盔，双臂似乎插上了翅膀，身穿浅橙色外衣，打扮得像赛马者。他们起身拉紧马鬃上的缰绳，那马便疾驰而去，仿佛脚上长有翅膀。我的目光追随着他们的路线，确切地说，追随着他们的飞行，一心想知道他们要往哪里去；看哪，这三个骑马人分散到南、西、北三个方向，第四个跑了没多远停在了东方。<br><br>我对此困惑不已，就仰望天堂，询问这些骑马人要往何处去。得到的答复是：“他们被派往欧洲各国的智者那里去，这些人在进行判断时善于推理，头脑敏锐，在他们自己的国家因天赋异禀而赫赫有名。他们被召来，是为了解开这个秘密，即：婚姻之爱及其活力或性能力的源头。”我从天上被告知：“稍等片刻，你会看到二十七辆马车。三辆载有西班牙人，三辆载有法国人，三辆载有意大利人，三辆载有德国人，三辆载有荷兰人，三辆载有英国人，三辆载有瑞典人，三辆载有丹麦人，三辆载有波兰人。”两个小时后，这些马车映入眼帘，拉车的浅色小马饰有华丽的马具。只见他们朝东南边界处的一栋高大建筑疾驶而去。乘车的人都在这幢建筑周围下车，在高昂的灵里进入其中。<br><br>这时，我被告知：“你也进去听听吧。”于是，我就走了进去。在勘察这建筑内部时，我发现它四四方方，四面分别对着四个方位。每一面都有三个带水晶窗格的高大窗户，窗框是橄榄木的。窗框的两边都有从墙壁突出的隆起物，就像一个个带有拱形天花板的房间，里面还有桌子。这些房间的墙壁是香柏木的，天花板是上等香木的，地板铺的是白杨木。靠东墙（这个地方看不到窗户）摆着一张包金的桌子，上面放着一顶镶满宝石的头冠。这个头冠将作为奖品或赏赐，奖给解开这个秘密的人。<br><br>我打量这几个带有屋顶的隆起物，它们就像设在窗边的一个个小隔间。我发现每个隔间都有五个来自同一个欧洲国家的人，所有人都已准备就绪，就等要进行判断的题目了。立时有天使站在这大厅中央，说：“你们要进行判断的题目是婚姻之爱及其活力或性能力的源头。请讨论它、得出结论，并把你们的结论写在纸上，投到金桌旁边的银鼎里。请在纸上注明你们国家的首字母。如，法国人或高卢人注上F；荷兰人或巴达维人注上B；意大利人注上I；英国人或盎格鲁人注上A；波兰人注上P；德国人注上G；西班牙人注上H*；丹麦人注上D；瑞典人注上S*。”说完这些话，天使就离开了，临走时说：“我会回来的。”于是，在窗边的各隔间内，五个同胞将注意力集中到所宣布的题目上，认真分析研究，以其出色的判断天赋作出决定，并将其写在纸上，注上他们国家的首字母，然后将纸投到银鼎里。三个小时后，这事就完成了，天使也回来了，从银鼎里依次取出这些纸，在会众面前读起来。<br><br>注：这些首字母在拉丁文中是首字母。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>103、讲到这儿，我补充以下两节。第一节：</p><p>一天在太阳出来之前，我向精神世界的东方看去，见到四个骑马的人，好像是从黎明的光芒中飞出来。他们头上似乎戴着卷起来的头盔。他们的胳膊好象是翅膀。身上穿着橙色的长衫，他们的妆束好象是赛马者，跳上骏马，急驰而过。</p><p>我目光跟随着他们想看看他们要到那里去，突然其中三个人向三个不同的方向奔去。第四个人在跑了一段距离后在东方停了下来。</p><p>我吃惊地向着天上问他们要到哪里去。得知他们是要到“欧洲的那些聪明的有很好分析力被称为天才的人中去。他们受命去了解婚姻之爱来源及其能量。”</p><p>天堂里传来的声音还说：“继续看，一会儿你会看到二十七辆马车，三辆中坐着西班牙人，三辆中坐着法国人，三辆中坐着意大利人，三辆中坐着德国人，三辆中做着荷兰人，三辆中坐着英国人，三辆中坐着瑞典人，三辆中坐着丹麦人，三辆中坐着波兰人。”</p><p>两个小时后，马车又出现，由浅红棕色的小马拉着，马装饰着精美的马具。飞快地向东方和南方交界处的一个大房子驶去。到了后，乘车者都下车信步走到大房子里。</p><p>我还被告知：过去吧，进去听听。”</p><p>我走进去，审视着房子内部。它是四方形的，每一边都正对着指南针上的一个方向。每一边墙上有三个水晶窗，窗框是橄榄木制成的。房间有圆形房顶，屋里有桌子。墙是由香柏木建的，屋顶是由珍贵的香木制成，地板是白杨木的，东面的墙上没有窗户而是在旁边放着一张长桌子，桌子上放着镶满宝石的贵冠，这贵冠将被授予答对问题的人。</p><p>我沿着墙边在屋子里走着，每个屋子里都有五个来自同一个欧洲国家的人。他们在等着要他们做出判断的问题。</p><p>突然间，一个天使出现在宫殿当中说道：“要你们做判断的问题是婚姻之爱及其力量。讨论这个问题并做出论判，将答案写在纸上并放在金桌子上的银缸里，并简要注明你所来自的国家，你若来自法国就注是F，若来自荷兰就注明N，若来自意大利就注明I，若来自英国就注明E，若来自波兰就注明P，若来自德国就注明G，若来自西班牙就注明SP，若来自丹麦就注明D，若来自瑞典就注明SW。”</p><p>说完后天使离开了，但是天使说他还会回来。</p><p>在各个屋子里的五个来自同一国家的人开始分析，讨论，最后达成结论，写了下来，注上所来自的国度后，将结果放到了银制的缸儿里了。</p><p>三个小时候，所有人都完成了后，天使回来了，从银缸儿里拿出答案读给众人听。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #103 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>103. At this point I shall add two accounts of experiences, the first of which is this.<p>One morning before sunrise I looked towards the east in the spiritual world, and saw four horsemen as it were flying out of a cloud shining with the flaming light of dawn. On the horsemen's heads were to be seen helmets with raised brims, on their arms what looked like wings, and about their bodies tunics of orange colour. Then, dressed as racers, they rose in their stirrups, stretching the reins above the manes of the horses, which galloped as if they had wings on their feet. I followed with my eyes their course, or rather flight, with the idea of discovering where they were going; and I saw three of the horsemen spread out towards three points of the compass, south, west and north, while the fourth after a short distance stopped in the east.</p><p>[2] Wondering at this I looked up to heaven and asked where the horsemen were going. I got this reply: 'They are to be sent to the wise men in the various kingdoms of Europe, who in making judgments are skilled in reasoning and sharp-witted, and who have achieved distinction in their own countries for their intellectual abilities. They are summoned to come and resolve the problem of the source of conjugial love, and its strength or potency.'<p>I was told from heaven, 'Wait a little and you will see twenty-seven chariots; three containing Spaniards, three Frenchmen, three Italians, three Germans, three Dutchmen, three Englishmen, three Swedes, three Danes and three Poles.' Two hours later the chariots came into view pulled by dun-coloured ponies with elaborate harness. They sped towards a commodious building to be seen on the border between the east and the south. All the travellers in the chariots dismounted around this, and entered it in high spirits.</p><p>[3] Then I was told, 'You too may go and enter, so that you can listen.' So I went and passed inside. When I surveyed the interior of the building, I observed that it was square, each side looking out towards a compass-point. On each side there were three lofty windows filled with clear glass, the frames being of olive-wood. On either side of the window-frames there were projections from the walls forming as it were rooms with vaulted ceilings, and containing tables. The walls of these rooms were of cedar-wood, the ceilings of fine citron-wood, the floors of planks of poplar. On the east wall, where no windows were to be seen, was placed a table overlaid with gold, on which lay a headdress studded with precious stones, to be given as a reward or prize to the one who solved the problem that was to be set.</p><p>[4] As I let my gaze rove around the vaulted projections, which were like rooms next to the windows, I saw in each five men from each of the kingdoms of Europe, waiting ready to deal with the subject submitted to their judgment. Then all at once an angel took his place in the middle of the hall and said, 'The subject for you to judge will be the source of conjugial love, and of its strength or potency. Discuss this and come to a conclusion, When you have decided on your opinion, write it on a piece of paper and put this in the silver urn which you see placed next to the golden table. Sign the paper with the initial letter of your kingdom, F for France, B for Holland, I for Italy, A for England, P for Poland, G for Germany, H for Spain, D for Denmark and S for Sweden.' <sup >1</sup>After saying this the angel left, promising to return.<p>Then the five representatives in each chamber by a window discussed this decree, investigated it, and reached a decision to the best of their powers of judgment. This they wrote on papers signed with the initial letter of their kingdom, and placed them in the silver container. After three hours the angel came back and, taking the papers in sequence from the urn, read them to the assembled company. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #103 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>103. To this I will append two narrative accounts. Here is the first:<p>One morning before sunrise, I looked out towards the east in the spiritual world and I saw four horsemen seemingly flying out of a cloud that shone with the blaze of dawn. On the heads of the horsemen I saw curled helmets <sup >1</sup>, on their arms what appeared to be wings, and about their bodies light orange-colored tunics. Thus dressed, like racers they rose up on their horses and held the reins out over their manes, so that the horses went out at a gallop like wing-footed steeds.<p>I followed their course or flight with my eyes, with a mind to find out where they were going. Then suddenly three of the horsemen peeled off in three directions, to the south, the west, and the north, while the fourth pulled up after a short space and came to a halt in the east.</p><p>[2] Wondering at this, I looked up to heaven and asked where the horsemen were going. I received the reply, "To the wise in the kingdoms of Europe, people of polished reason and keen sight in analytical investigations who enjoyed a reputation for genius among their contemporaries. They are being summoned to come and solve the secret of the origin of conjugial love and its vigor or potency."<p>Those speaking from heaven also said, "Keep looking, and in a little while you will see twenty-seven carriages, three with Spaniards in them, three with natives of France or Frenchmen, three with Italians, three with Germans, three with natives of the Netherlands or Dutchmen, three with Englishmen, three with Swedes, three with Danes, and three with Poles."<p>Then, after two hours, their carriages appeared, drawn by ponies light bay in color with strikingly decorated harnesses. And traveling rapidly to an immense house visible in the border region between the east and the south, the riders all got out of their carriages around the house and boldly went in.</p><p>[3] Moreover I was then told, "Go on over and go in, too, and you will hear."<p>I went and entered the house, and examining it inside, I saw that it was square, with sides facing towards the four points of the compass. Each of the sides had three high windows containing panes of crystal, whose frames were made of olive wood. From either side of the frames projected walls in the form of rooms, with vaulted ceilings and containing tables. These walls were made out of cedar, the ceilings out of fine sandarac wood <sup >2</sup>, and the floors out of boards of poplar. Against the east wall - where I did not see any windows - a table stood, overlaid with gold, on which had been placed a miter covered with precious stones. This would go as an award or prize to the one who found the secret of the riddle to be presently put before them.</p><p>[4] As I looked around at the rooms formed by the projecting walls, which were like compartments along the windows, I saw in each of them five men from the same European kingdom, who were ready and waiting for the topic on which they were to render judgment.<p>Instantly, then, an angel stood in the middle of the palace and said, "The subject on which you are to render judgment is the origin of conjugial love and its vigor or potency. Discuss it and come to a decision. Then when you have reached a decision, write your opinion on a piece of paper and put it into the silver urn that you see placed beside the gold table. Also, sign it with the initial letter of the kingdom you are from. For example, if you are natives of France or French, write F. If you are natives of the Netherlands or Dutch, write N. If you are Italian, write I. If you are English, write E. If you are Polish, write P. If you are German, write G. If you are Spanish, write Sp. If you are Danish, write D. And if you are Swedish, write Sw."<p>With these words the angel departed, saying as he left, "I will return."<p>The five fellow countrymen in each compartment along the windows then considered this instruction, analyzed the subject, and after coming to a decision to the best of their ability to judge, wrote it down on a piece of paper, signed it with the initial letter of their kingdom, and put it into the hollow silver container.<p>Three hours later, when they were all finished, the angel returned to draw the pieces of paper out of the urn one by one and read them in the presence of the whole gathering.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Probably morions or comb morions.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Literally, "thyine wood." See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_12.htm">Revelation 18:12</a>, where it has been variously translated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #103 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>103. I'll add to these remarks two stories. Here is the first:<p>Once, in the morning, before sunrise, I looked toward the east in the spiritual world, and I saw four horsemen seem to fly up out of a cloud gleaming with the flame of the sunrise. On the heads of the horsemen you could see plumed helmets, something like wings on their arms, and lightweight orange tunics on their bodies. Dressed this way as for a race, they rose up and laid the reins on the manes of the horses, which ran as if with winged feet.<p>I followed their course, or rather, flight, with my eyes to satisfy my mind where they were going, and saw three horsemen scatter to three quarters - south, west, and north - while the fourth stayed briefly in the east.<p>Surprised by these things I looked up into the sky and asked, "Where are those horsemen going?"<p>The answer was, "To the sages in the countries of Europe, who have intellectual polish and keen insight when it comes to investigating things, and are highly praised among their people for their talents, to have them come and explain the secret source of married love and its virtue, or potency."<p>These words came from the sky. "Wait a bit, and you will see twenty - seven chariots, three with Spaniards in them, three with Frenchmen or Gauls, three with Italians, three with Germans, three with Hollanders or Netherlanders, three with English, three with Swedes, three with Danes, and three with Poles."<p>Then after two hours the chariots appeared, drawn by light bay ponies with eye - catching harnesses. They drove swiftly to a large building I could see on the boundary between the east and the south. Everyone in the chariots got out near the building and went inside in good spirits.<p>Then I was told, "You go, too. Go inside and you'll hear."<p>I went and entered, and looking over the building inside, I saw that it was square, with its sides facing the four points of the compass. In the sides were three high windows of crystalline glass with frames of olive wood. On either side of the frames partitions came from the walls, forming cubicles, vaulted above, with tables in them. The walls of the cubicles were cedar. The roof was noble white cedar, the floor poplar planks. At the east wall, where windows were not to be seen, a table overlaid with gold was placed. Arranged on it was a tiara studded with precious stones, to go as a token or prize to whoever should solve the problem soon to be proposed.<p>When I glanced over the walled cubicles <they were like alcoves at the windows) I saw five men in each, from each European country, ready and waiting for the subject they were to consider.<p>And then suddenly an angel stood in the middle of the palace and said, "The subject of your judgment will be the source of love in marriage and of its energy or potency. Discuss this and decide, write your decision on paper and put it in the silver urn that you see placed beside the gold table. And put the initial of your country on it in this way - France or Gaul, F; Holland or the Netherlands, N; Italy, I; England, E; Poland, P; Germany, G;<p>Hispania, H; Denmark, D, and Sweden, S."<p>After saying these things the angel went away, saying, "I'll be back." And then the five countrymen in each alcove by the windows turned their minds to the announcement, reflected, reached a decision according to their best judgment, wrote it on paper, added the initial of their country, and put it in the silver bowl.<p>In three hours they were all done. The angel came back, picked the papers out of the urn one by one, and read them before the gathering. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #103 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>103. To the above I will add two Memorable Relations. First this:<p>One morning before sunrise, when looking towards the east in the spiritual world, I saw four horsemen flying as from a cloud resplendent with the flame of dawn. Upon the horsemen's heads appeared crested helmets, upon their arms wings, as it were, and about their bodies light orange-colored tunics. Thus clad as racers, they rose up, pulled tight the reins over the manes of their horses, and the horses speeded off as though with winged feet. With my eyes, I followed their course or flight with a mind to know whither they were going; and lo, three of the horsemen spread out to the three quarters, south, west, and north, and after a short course the fourth stopped in the east.</p><p>[2] Wondering at this, I looked up to heaven and asked whither those horsemen were going. I received the answer: "To the wise in the kingdoms Of Europe--men of keen reason and acute discernment in the investigation of subjects, and eminent among their fellow countrymen for their ingenuity--that they may come and solve the secret concerning THE ORIGIN OF CONJUGIAL LOVE AND OF ITS VIRTUE OR POTENCY"<p>Angels then said from heaven, "Wait a little and you will see twenty-seven chariots, three with Spaniards in them, three with Frenchmen or Gauls, three with Italians, three with Germans, three with Batavians or Hollanders, three with Englishmen, three with Swedes, three with Danes, and three with Poles." Two hours later the chariots appeared, drawn by small light-bay horses elegantly caparisoned. Their riders were swiftly carried towards a spacious house which was seen in the common boundary of the east and the south. Around this house all the riders alighted from their chariots and entered the house in high spirits.</p><p>[3] It was then said to me, "Go you also and enter and you shall hear." So I went and entered. Examining the building within, I saw that it was square, the sides looking to the four quarters. On each side were three lofty windows of crystalline glass, with posts of olive wood. On either side of the posts were projections from the walls, like rooms, vaulted above and containing tables. The walls of these rooms were of cedar, the roof was of noble thyine wood, and the floor was boarded with poplar. Against the eastern wall, where no windows were seen, was set a table overlaid with gold, whereon was placed a tiara set around with precious stones. This was to be given as a prize or reward to him who should search out the secret about to be propounded.</p><p>[4] As I looked at the several roofed projections which were like stalls set by the windows, I saw in each, five men from one or other of the countries of Europe, all ready, awaiting the subject for the exercise of their judgment.<p>Then, all at once an angel stood in the middle of the palace and said: "The subject for the exercise of your judgment will be CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF CONJUGIAL LOVE AND OF ITS VIRTUE OR POTENCY. Discuss this subject, come to a decision, and write your decision on paper, signing it with the initial letter of the kingdom from which you come; that is, F for the Frenchmen or Gauls, B for the Batavians or Hollanders, I for the Italians, A for the Anglians or Englishmen, P for the Poles, G for the Germans, H for the Hispanians or Spaniards, D for the Danes, and S for the Swedes. Then put the paper into this silver urn which you see placed beside the golden table." With these words, the angel departed, saying, "I will return."<p>The five compatriots in each of the stalls by the windows then turned their attention to the subject that had been proclaimed, examined into it, and made their decision in accordance with the excellence of their judicial endowments. These decisions they wrote down on papers signed with the initial letter of their kingdom, and put them into the silver receptacle. In three hours, this business being finished, the angel returned and, drawing the papers out of the urn one after the other, read them before the assembly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #103 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>103. I add two Memorabilia.<p>I<p>One morning before sunrise, as I looked toward the east in the spiritual world, I beheld four horsemen flying, so it seemed, out of a cloud resplendent with the glow of dawn. On the horsemen's heads appeared crested helmets; on their arms, as it were wings; and about their bodies light tunics of an orange color. Thus arrayed as for speed, they bent forward and drew the reins taut over the manes of their horses, which sped along as though their feet were winged. I followed their course or flight with my eyes, with a mind to know where they were going. Three of the horsemen shot off in three directions, south, west and north; and the fourth came to an abrupt stop in the east.</p><p>[2] Wondering at this, I looked up to heaven and asked where the horsemen were going. I received for answer:<p>"To the wise in the kingdoms of Europe, men of keen reason and acute insight in investigating subjects, who enjoy high praise among their people for their genius; that they may come and explain the secret of The Origin of Marital Love and of its Vigor or Potency."<p>They said from heaven, "Wait a while and you will see twenty-seven chariots, three with Spaniards in them, three with French or Gauls, three with Italians, three with Germans, three with Batavians or Hollanders, three with English, three with Swedes, three with Danes, and three with Poles."<p>After two hours the chariots appeared, drawn by small, light-bay horses, elegantly caparisoned. They swept toward a spacious building which was to be seen in the southeast. There all the occupants of the chariots alighted, and entered with an air of confidence.<p>And I was bidden, "Do you go in, too, and listen."</p><p>[3] I went and entered. Examining the building inside, I noted that it was square, the sides turned to the four quarters. On each side were three lofty windows of crystalline glass, with frames of olive wood. Beside each window were projections from the walls like chambers, vaulted over, with tables in them. The walls of the chambers were of cedar, the roof of noble thyine-wood, and the floor of poplar plank. Against the eastern wall, which had no windows, stood a table overlaid with gold, on which was placed a tiara studded with precious stones; this was to be bestowed as a prize or reward on the man who should solve the secret about to be propounded.</p><p>[4] As I glanced along the chambered projections, like so many closets beside the windows, I saw in each five men from each kingdom of Europe, ready and awaiting the subject on which they were to form judgments.<p>At that instant an angel stood in the center of the palace, and said, "The subject on which you are to form a judgment is The Origin of Marital Love and of its Vigor or Potency. Consider it and decide. Set down your decision on a paper to be put into this silver urn which you see placed beside the golden table. Subscribe yourselves with the initial letter of the kingdom from which you are; that is, for the French or Gauls, F; for the Batavians or Hollanders, B; for the Italians, I; for the English, E; for the Poles, P; for the Germans, G; for the Spaniards (Hispani), H; for the Danes, D; and for the Swedes, S." With these words the angel departed, saying, "I shall return."<p>Then the five compatriots in the apartments by the windows revolved and analysed the proposition, and according to the excellence of their gift of judgment made their decision, wrote it on sheets of paper subscribed with the initial letter of their kingdom, and cast it into the silver receptacle. This was over in three hours, when the angel returned, drew the papers out of the urn, one after another, and read them to the assemblage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #103 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>103. To the above I will add two Relations. First this:<p>One morning before sunrise I was looking towards the east in the spiritual world, and saw four horsemen flying forth as it were out of a cloud resplendent with the flame of dawn. Upon the horsemen's heads appeared crested helmets; upon their arms, as it were wings; and about their bodies light, orange-colored tunics. Thus clad as for a rapid race they rose, laid the reins upon their horses' manes, and they sped as with winged feet. I followed their course, or flight, with my eyes, with a mind to know whither they were going. When lo! three of the horsemen scattered in three directions, to the south, to the west, and to the north; and the fourth stopped a brief space to the east.<p>Wondering at this, I looked up to heaven and asked whither those horsemen were going; and received the answer:<p>'To the wise in the kingdoms of Europe, who are men of keen reason and acute discernment in the investigation of subjects, and renowned for the fame of their genius among their own; that they may come and solve the mystery of The Origin of Conjugial Love, and of its Virtue or Potency.'<p>And they said from heaven, 'Wait a little and you will see twenty-seven chariots, three with Spaniards in them, three with French or Gauls, three with Italians, three with Germans, three with Batavians or Hollanders, three with English, three with Swedes, three with Danes, and three with Poles.'<p>And then after two hours the chariots appeared, drawn by small, light bay horses, elegantly caparisoned. They sped swiftly towards a spacious building that was seen on the confines of the east and south; around which all that rode in the chariots alighted and entered in high spirit.<p>And then it was said to me, 'Go also and enter in and you shall hear.' I went and entered. And looking about the building within I observed that it was square, the sides looking to the four quarters. On each side were three lofty windows of crystalline glass, the frames of which were of olive wood. On either hand, at the side of the frames, were projections from the walls like chambers, vaulted above, with tables in them. The walls of these were of cedar, and the roof of the noble thyine-tree; and the floor was of poplar plank Against the eastern wall, where windows were not seen, was set a table overlaid with gold, whereon was placed a tiara set around with precious stones, which was to be given as a prize or reward to him who should discover the secret about to be propounded to them. As I glanced at the chambered projections, which were as closets next to the windows, I saw in each five men, from each country of Europe, who were ready, waiting for the subject of their judgments.<p>At that instant an angel stood in the midst of the palace, and said, 'The subject of your judgments will be, The Origin of Conjugial Love, and of its Virtue or Potency. Consider it and decide, and write your decision on paper and put it into this silver urn which you see placed beside the golden table; and subscribe the initial letter of the kingdom from which you are; that is for the French or Gallic, F; for the Batavian or Hollandish, B; for the Italian, 1; for the English (Anglis), A; for the Polish, P.; for the German, G.; for the Spanish (Hispani), H.; for the Danish, D.; and for the Swedish, S.' With these words the angel departed, saying, ‘I will come again.'<p>Then the five compatriots, in each apartment by the windows, turned the proposition over, looked it through, and according to the excellence of their gift of judgment made their decision, wrote it upon paper subscribed with the initial letter of their kingdom, and cast it into the silver receptacle. This done, after three hours the angel returned, and drew the papers in succession out of the urn and read them before the assemblage.<p>Ttt[2] Wondering at this, I looked up to heaven and asked whither those horsemen were going; and received the answer:<p>'To the wise in the kingdoms of Europe, who are men of keen reason and acute discernment in the investigation of subjects, and renowned for the fame of their genius among their own; that they may come and solve the mystery of The Origin of Conjugial Love, and of its Virtue or Potency.'<p>And they said from heaven, 'Wait a little and you will see twenty-seven chariots, three with Spaniards in them, three with French or Gauls, three with Italians, three with Germans, three with Batavians or Hollanders, three with English, three with Swedes, three with Danes, and three with Poles.'<p>And then after two hours the chariots appeared, drawn by small, light bay horses, elegantly caparisoned. They sped swiftly towards a spacious building that was seen on the confines of the east and south; around which all that rode in the chariots alighted and entered in high spirit.</p><p>And then it was said to me, 'Go also and enter in and you shall hear.' I went and entered. And looking about the building within I observed that it was square, the sides looking to the four quarters.

On either hand, at the side of the frames, were projections from the walls like chambers, vaulted above, with tables in them.

As I glanced at the chambered projections, which were as closets next to the windows, I saw in each five men, from each country of Europe, who were ready, waiting for the subject of their judgments.<p>At that instant an angel stood in the midst of the palace, and said, 'The subject of your judgments will be, The Origin of Conjugial Love, and of its Virtue or Potency. Consider it and decide, and write your decision on paper and put it into this silver urn which you see placed beside the golden table; and subscribe the initial letter of the kingdom from which you are; that is for the French or Gallic, F; for the Batavian or Hollandish, B; for the Italian, 1; for the English (Anglis), A; for the Polish, P.; for the German, G.; for the Spanish (Hispani), H.; for the Danish, D.; and for the Swedish, S.' With these words the angel departed, saying, ‘I will come again.'<p>Then the five compatriots, in each apartment by the windows, turned the proposition over, looked it through, and according to the excellence of their gift of judgment made their decision, wrote it upon paper subscribed with the initial letter of their kingdom, and cast it into the silver receptacle. This done, after three hours the angel returned, and drew the papers in succession out of the urn and read them before the assemblage.</p><p>[3] As I glanced at the chambered projections, which were as closets next to the windows, I saw in each five men, from each country of Europe, who were ready, waiting for the subject of their judgments.<p>At that instant an angel stood in the midst of the palace, and said, 'The subject of your judgments will be, The Origin of Conjugial Love, and of its Virtue or Potency.

<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #103 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>103. His adjiciam duo Memorabilia; Primum hoc. Quodam mane ante ortum solis, prospexi versus Orientem in Mundo spirituali, et vidi quatuor Equites sicut evolantes ex nube fulgente ex flamma aurorae; super Equitum capitibus visae sunt cassides crispatae, super brachiis sicut alae, et circum corpora leves tunicae coloris aurantii; sic vestiti ut veloces, insurgebant et intendebant lora super jubis equorum, qui sic excurrebant sicut alipedes: sequebar visu cursum seu volatum illorum mente cognoscendi quo pergerent; et ecce tres Equites effuderunt se in tres plagas, Meridiem, Occidentem, et Septentrionem, et quartus in spatio brevi in Oriente substitit.</p><p>[2] Haec admiratus suspexi <sup>1</sup>in Coelum, et quaesivi, quo pergerent Equites illi, et responsum tuli, "ad Sapientes in Regnis Europae, qui in dispiciendis rebus limata ratione et acuta acie sunt, ac ingenii laude apud suos effloruerunt, ut adveniant et solvant Secretum de Amoris Conjugialis Origine, et de ejus Virtute seu Potentia;" et dixerunt e Coelo, "attende paulum, et visurus es viginti septem Currus, Tres in quibus Hispani, Tres in quibus Franci seu Galli, Tres in quibus Itali, Tres in quibus Germani, Tres in quibus Batavi seu Hollandi, Tres in quibus Angli, Tres in quibus Sueci, Tres in quibus Dani, et tres in quibus Poloni;" et tunc post bihorium visi sunt illi Currus tracti a mannis coloris helvi insigniter phaleratis, ac perniciter ferebantur ad spatiosam Domum visam in confinio Orientis et Meridiei, circa quam omnes vecti curribus exibant, et forti spiritu intrabant;</p><p>[3] et tunc dictum est mihi, "vade ac intra etiam tu, et audies:" ego vadi et intravi, et lustrans Domum intus, vidi quod esset quadrata, prospectus laterum ad Plagas, in quovis latere tres altae Fenestrae ex vitris chrystallinis, harum Postes ex ligno olei; utrinque a latere postium Eductiones e parietibus sicut Camerae supra fornicatae, ubi Mensae; Parietes harum erant ex cedris, Tectum ex ligno nobili thyino, Solum ex asseribus populi; ad parietem Orientalem, ubi non visae sunt fenestrae, posita erat Mensa obducta auro, super qua locata erat Cidaris lapidibus pretiosis circumobsita, quae cederet in palmam seu praemium illi, qui evestigaret Secretum mox proponendum.</p><p>[4] Cum visum distribui ad cameratas Eductiones, quae erant sicut Conclavia juxta fenestras, vidi quinque Viros in quavis ex quovis Regno Europae, qui parati exspectabant Objectum judiciorum suorum; et illico tunc constitit Angelus in medio Palatii, et dixit, "Objectum judiciorum vestrorum erit, de Amoris Conjugialis Origine, et de ejus Virtute seu Potentia; ventilate hoc, et decernite: ac decretam sententiam inscribite chartae, et immittite hanc in argenteam Urnam, quam juxta Mensam auream videtis positam, et subscribite initialem Literam Regni, e quo estis, ut a Francis seu Gallis F, a Batavis seu Hollandis B, ab Italis I, ab Anglis A, a Polonis P, a Germanis G, ab Hispanis H, a Danis D, et a Suecis S." His dictis Angelus abivit, et dixit, "redibo;" et tunc quinque Populares in quovis Conclavio ad fenestras, edictum illud versabant, dispiciebant, et secundum praestantiam dotum suorum judiciorum decernebant, chartis inscribebant, subscripta litera initiali sui Regni, et in argenteum Cavum immittebant. His post trihorium peractis, redibat Angelus, et ex Urna eduxit chartas ordine, et legit coram Congregatis. <p>@1. Prima editio: suspex </p>
