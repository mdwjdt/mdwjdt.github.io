<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第7节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>7、这事过后，天使又召集被称为智者的这一组，他们认为天上喜乐和永恒幸福在于无上的权力和无尽的财富，在于连帝王也无法企及的富丽堂皇和无与伦比的辉煌。因为圣言里说，他们必是国王和王子，必与基督同掌权，直到永远，必被天使伺候等等。天使对这些人说：“请跟我来，我必带你们享受你们所想象的欢乐。”于是，他领他们进入一个拱廊，拱廊由圆柱和金字塔建成，前面是一个低矮的宫殿，它是通向拱廊的入口。天使领他们穿过宫殿，发现两边各有二十人在等候着。这时，扮演天使的演员忽然出现，对他们说：“去天堂的路要经过这个拱廊。稍等片刻，做好准备，因为你们当中的年长者要成为国王，年轻的要成为王子。”<br><br>话音刚落，就见每个圆柱旁出现一个宝座，上面放了一件丝袍，丝袍上面有一个权杖和一个皇冠。每个金字塔旁都有一个离地三肘的座椅，每个座椅上都有一条金链子和两头镶满钻石的骑士肩带。然后，有喊声响起：“现在请穿戴整齐，入座等待。”年长者立刻奔向宝座，年轻人则跑向座椅，穿上长袍坐下来。接着，有一股迷雾从下面升腾起来，坐在宝座和座椅上的人由于吸入这迷雾，他们的脸开始肿胀，胸膛也鼓起来，并且自信满满，以为自己现在就是国王和王子了。那迷雾其实是迷惑他们的幻光。突然间，一些年轻人似乎从天上飞来，并在旁边侍立，每个宝座后面两个，每个座椅后面一个，以服侍他们。使者反复宣称：“你们这些国王和王子要在这里多等会儿，你们的王宫正在天堂准备着，侍臣和随从很快就来接你们到那里去。”他们等啊等，直等到他们的灵开始气喘吁吁，他们因着渴望而疲倦不堪。<br><br>三个小时后，他们头上的天开了，天使俯视并怜悯他们说：“你们为何还傻傻坐在那里，像演戏一样？他们愚弄你们，把你们从人变成木偶，因为你们心里笃定，你们必像国王和王子一样与基督同掌权，还有天使伺候你们。难道你们忘了主的话：谁要在天上为大，就必作仆人吗？所以，你们必须了解国王、王子，以及与基督同掌权到底是什么意思。这意味着要有智慧，提供服务。因为基督的国，也就是天堂，是服务的王国。主爱所有人，愿意向所有人行善，而善就是服务。既然主行善或提供服务间接通过天使，在尘世则通过人，那祂必赐予忠诚提供服务者对服务之爱及其奖赏，这奖赏就是内在的祝福，这才是永恒的幸福。<br><br>“和世上一样，天堂也有无上的权力和无尽的财富。那里有政府和政府部门，因此也就有大大小小的权力和等级。职位最高者拥有宫殿和王宫，其壮丽辉煌远超世间帝王的，还有大量朝臣、部长和随从，他们所穿的华服营造出尊贵荣耀的氛围。但这些最高统治者是从那些心系公众福祉的人当中选出来的，他们的身体感官关注壮丽辉煌只是为了能更好地顺服。由于公众福祉要求人人都应在社群中发挥某种作用，社群就是一个共同体，而一切服务皆出自主，看似通过天使和世人来履行，所以显而易见，这才是与主同掌权。”听到天上传来的这些话，扮演国王和王子的那些人从宝座和座椅上下来，扔掉他们的权杖、皇冠和长袍。那带来幻光的迷雾从他们身上退去，然后，他们被含有智慧之光的亮云遮盖，这亮云使他们头脑清醒过来。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>7、（1）之后，天使召集所谓的智者，那些认为天堂的快乐及由此产生的幸福来自于无限的权力、财富、荣耀，因为在《圣经》中说，这些人将成为国王和王子，他们将与基督一起直到永远，天使将服务于他们等等。</p><p>天使对他们说：“跟着我，我将向你们介绍你们的快乐。天使带他们来到一个由柱子及塔形支柱构成的走廓。在它的前方是一个简朴的宫殿建筑，它通向走廓的入口。天使带他们走过宫殿，他们看到人们在这里等待着。这里二十个，那里二十个。突然，一个演员出现了，充当了天使的角色，对他们说：“这个走廓通向天堂。在这儿等一会，准备好，因为你们中年长的将成为国王，年轻的将成为王子。”</p><p>（2）说着，每个柱子旁出现了一把椅子，上面放着一件丝制的长袍，长袍上放着国王的拐杖和王冠。在每个塔状的柱子旁出现一把郡国头领的王位，上面有金制的链子，两端系着爵士的肩章。之后有人宣布：“去吧，穿戴好，就座，等着。”</p><p>倾刻间，年长的跑到王位上，年轻的来到爵士的位置上坐下。</p><p>之后有一种雾状的东西出现了，从低处升起，坐在王位上的人吸入这种气体后，脸肿了起来，胸也膨胀起来，他们充满了自信，他们现在是国王和王子了。他们被注入了这种幻想的雾气。</p><p>突然，一些年轻人飞到他们旁边，好像是来自于天堂，国王的位置后站着两个人，爵士的后面站着一个人，服务于他们。不时地，有些使者喊道：“国王及王子们，你们再多等一会，你们在天堂中的宫殿正在准备之中。你们的朝臣们一会就会来，带着随从来指导你们。”</p><p>他们等啊，等啊，直到他们的精神开始动摇并厌倦了等待。</p><p>（3）三个小时后，天国之门在他们上方敞开，天使们看到他们。出于怜悯，天使说：“你们为什么傻傻地坐在那，好像演员一样？”他们在玩弄你们，将你们变成了偶像，因为你们心中想着与基督一起管理世界，天使们要服务于你们。你们忘了主的话了吗？在天国中渴望显赫的人将会成为奴仆。</p><p>“弄清楚国王和王子以及与基督一起管理世界是什么意思。它意味着要明智并且服务于他人。因为基督的国度，也就是天国就是服务的国度。原因是，主爱一切人，希望一切人都好，好意味着有意义的服务。现在，因为主在通过天使而做好事，做有益的服务，在世间通过人们完成这些，因而对那些忠诚地行使职责的人，主给他们一种爱及相应的回报。这种回报是一种内在的祝福，是永恒的幸福。</p><p>（4）“无限的权力及财富与世间一样，也存在于天国中，因为有政府及其形式，那里也有较高的职位和较低的职位。并且，那里最高的职位的人有优于世间一切帝王的宫殿。因为他们无数的朝臣，随从以及他们的衣饰，他们被荣誉所环绕。</p><p>“然而，处于最高职位上的人，来自于那些关注公共事务的人们，他们因为被人们所服从而置身于无限的荣耀中。因为每个人都有益于社会组成了公共利益，就象一具共同的躯体一样，因为一切有益的服务都来自于主，并通过天使和人而行使，很明显，这就是与主一起管理世界。”</p><p>听到这些来自于天堂的话，扮演国王和爵士的人从王位上下来，脱掉了王袍，扔了拐杖。那种幻想的雾气也远离了我们，一朵明亮的云将他们包围，云中蕴含着明智的氛围。于是他们返回到正常状态。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #7 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>7. After this the angel called to himself the group of so-called wise men, who had regarded heavenly joys and everlasting happiness arising from these as consisting in surpassing dominions and the richest treasures, and in magnificence beyond the reach of kings and splendour beyond compare. This was because it is said in the Word that they are to be kings and princes, and to reign with Christ for ever, and angels are to wait upon them, and much more besides. The angel said to them: 'Follow me and I shall bring you into your imagined joys.' So he took them into an arcade built of columns and pyramids; in front was a low palace, and through this there was an open entrance to the arcade. He took them through this, and there they found twenty people in one place and twenty in another, all waiting. Then an actor playing the part of an angel suddenly appeared and said to them: 'The way to heaven lies through this arcade. Wait a little while and prepare yourselves, because the older ones of you are to be kings, the younger princes.'</p><p>[2] When he said this, a throne appeared next to each column, and on the throne a robe of silk, and on the robe a sceptre and a crown; and next to each pyramid appeared a chair raised three cubits above the ground, and on the chair a chain with gold links, and sashes of knighthood with diamond-studded globes at their ends. Then the cry went up, 'Come now and dress yourselves, take your seats and wait.' At once the older men hurried to the thrones and the younger men to the chairs, put on their robes and sat down. Then what looked like a mist appeared coming up from below; and as a result of breathing this those who sat on the thrones and chairs had their faces begin to swell up, and their chests were puffed up, and they were filled with a confident belief that they were now kings and princes. The mist was the aura of delusion which inspired them. Then suddenly young men flew in as if from heaven and stood, two behind each throne and one behind each chair, to wait on them. Then it was repeatedly proclaimed by a herald; 'You kings and princes are to wait here a little longer. Your courts are now being made ready in heaven, and your courtiers and attendants will shortly be here to take you to them.' They kept on waiting and waiting, until their spirits began to gasp and they were worn out through longing.</p><p>[3] After three hours heaven was opened above their heads, and the angels looked down and pitied them. 'Why,' they said, 'do you sit like this looking foolish and playing at acting? They have made fools of you and changed you from human beings into dummies, because you believed in your hearts that you would reign with Christ as kings and princes, and that then angels would wait upon you. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that he who would be great in heaven must become a servant? You must learn therefore what is meant by kings and princes and by reigning with Christ. This means being wise and performing services. For Christ's kingdom, which is heaven, is a kingdom of services. For the Lord loves all and so wishes to do good to all, and good is service. Since the Lord does good or performs services indirectly through angels, and in the world through people, He gives those who faithfully perform services a love of service and its reward, which is inward blessedness, and this is everlasting happiness.</p><p>[4] There are in the heavens, as on earth, surpassing dominions and the richest treasures. For there are governments and forms of government, and therefore major and minor authorities and ranks. Those who hold the highest offices have palaces and council-chambers, the magnificence and splendour of which surpass those of the palaces and council-chambers of emperors and kings on earth; and the number of their courtiers, ministers and attendants, and the magnificent uniforms they wear, form for them an ambience of honour and glory. But these highest rulers are chosen from those whose heart is in the welfare of society, and only their bodily senses are concerned with the greatness of magnificence, in order to inspire obedience. Since the public weal demands that everyone should serve some purpose in the community as being the common body, and since all service comes from the Lord, and is performed by angels and by men as if of themselves, it is obvious that this is reigning with the Lord.'<p>On hearing this from heaven the people dressed up as kings and princes came down from their thrones and chairs, and threw away their sceptres, crowns and robes. The mist which brought the aura of delusion went away, and they were covered by a shining cloud containing an aura of wisdom, and this brought sanity back to their minds. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #7 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>7. After that the angel called to himself the company of the so-called wise who had placed heavenly joys, and because of them eternal happiness, in positions of great power, possessions of great riches, and so superregal magnificence and superglorious splendor, because it says in the Word that they will be kings and princes, <sup >1</sup>that they will reign with Christ to eternity, <sup >2</sup>and that the angels will minister to them, <sup >3</sup>among other things.<p>The angel said to them, "Follow me and I will introduce you to your joys." And he led them to a gallery constructed out of columns and pyramidal piers. In front of it was a humble palace, through which the entrance to the gallery opened. The angel led them through the palace, and behold, they saw people waiting, twenty here and twenty there. Then suddenly an actor appeared, playing the part of an angel, who said to them, "The way to heaven lies through this gallery. Wait here a little while and prepare yourselves, because the older ones among you are going to become kings and the younger princes."</p><p>[2] At these words a throne appeared next to each column, with a silk robe upon the throne, and upon the robe a scepter and crown. And next to each pier appeared a chair of state raised three cubits <sup >4</sup>from the ground, with a chain made of links of gold upon the chair and sashes of knighthood fastened at the ends with circlets of diamonds. Then the proclamation rang out, "Go now, dress yourselves, take your seats, and wait!"<p>And instantly the older ones ran to the thrones and the younger ones to the chairs of state, and they dressed themselves and took their seats.<p>But then a kind of mist appeared rising from below, which the people sitting upon the thrones and chairs of state breathed in, and because of it their faces began to swell and their chests to rise, and they became filled with confidence that they were now kings and princes. The mist was an aura of fantasy, with which they were infused.<p>And suddenly young men flew to their sides, as though from heaven, and they stood two behind each throne and one behind each chair of state, to serve in attendance on them. Then from time to time some herald would cry out, "You kings and princes, wait a little while longer. Your courts are now being prepared in heaven. Your courtiers will arrive presently with attendants to conduct you."<p>They waited and waited, until their spirits were panting and they grew weary with longing.</p><p>[3] After three hours heaven opened above their heads and angels looked down, and taking pity on them the angels said, "Why are you sitting there so foolishly and behaving like play-actors? They are playing games with you and have turned you from men into idols, because you have instilled in your hearts that you will reign with Christ as kings and princes and that angels will then minister to you. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that in heaven whoever desires to be great becomes a servant? <sup >5</sup><p>"Learn therefore what is meant by kings and princes and by reigning with Christ. It means to be wise and perform useful services. For the kingdom of Christ, namely, heaven, is a kingdom of useful services. The reason is that the Lord loves all people and so wills good to all, and good means useful service. Now because the Lord performs good or useful services indirectly through angels, and in the world through people, therefore to those who faithfully perform useful services He gives a love of being useful and its reward. The reward is internal blessedness, and this blessedness is eternal happiness.</p><p>[4] "Positions of great power and possessions of great riches exist in heaven as well as on earth, for they have governments and forms of government in heaven and so also greater and lesser positions of power and rank. Moreover, people who are in the highest positions have palaces and courts which surpass in magnificence and splendor the palaces and courts of emperors and kings on earth. And because of the number of their courtiers, ministers and attendants and the magnificent vestments in which these are appareled, they are surrounded with honor and glory.<p>"Yet the people in the highest positions are chosen from those whose heart is in the public welfare, and only their bodily senses in the grandeur of magnificence for the sake of being obeyed. And because it contributes to the public welfare for everyone to be of some useful service in society, as in a common body, and because all useful service comes from the Lord and is rendered through angels and men as though from them, it is evident that this is what it is to reign with the Lord."<p>When they heard these words from heaven, the people playing at being kings and princes descended from their thrones and chairs of state and threw away their scepters, crowns and robes. And the mist which contained the aura of fantasy receded from them, and a bright cloud enveloped them, which contained an aura of wisdom. So sanity returned to their minds.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_10.htm">5:10</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-timothy_2_12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_1_13.htm">Hebrews 1:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>4.&nbsp;About four and a half feet.<br><br>5.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_26.htm">Matthew 20:26-27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_11.htm">23:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_35.htm">Mark 9:35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_43.htm">10:43</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #7 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>7. After this he called to him the group of so - called wise people who had placed the joys of heaven and the eternal happiness from them in supreme power, richest treasures, more prestige than royalty, and more brilliant glory, because in the Word it says they will be kings and princes, that they will reign with Christ to eternity, and that angels will serve them - among other things. The angel said to them, "Follow me, and I will lead you into your joys."<p>He led the way into a portico built of columns and pyramids.<p>In front of it was a low palace with an entrance open to the portico. He led them in through the arcade. Twenty people were waiting here and twenty there! And then suddenly someone came along impersonating an angel and told them, "The way to heaven is through this portico. Wait a while and get ready, because the older ones of you are going to be kings and the younger ones princes."<p>When he said this, a throne appeared by each column, with a silk robe on the throne and a scepter and crown on the robe. And by each pyramid an official seat appeared, elevated four and one half feet above the ground, and on the seat a chain of gold links and the ribbon of an order of knighthood joined at the ends with diamond circlets. And then came an announcement: "Now go enrobe yourselves, be seated, and wait." And immediately the older men scrambled to the thrones, and the younger to the official seats, and they put the robes on and sat down.<p>Then something mist-like appeared to rise up from below, and under its influence the ones seated on the thrones and seats began to swell in their faces, puff their chests out, and fill up with the assurance that now they were kings and princes. The mist was an airy form of the fantasy that inspired them. And suddenly, young men flew down as if from the sky and stood, two behind each throne and one behind each seat, to serve them. And then, from time to time, a herald would announce, "You kings and princes, wait a little longer. Your palaces are now being prepared in heaven. Courtiers with attendants will come right away and lead you in." They waited and waited until they were yawning and worn out with anticipation.<p>After three hours the sky opened up over their heads, and angels looked down at them. In pity for them they said, "Why are you sitting there playacting so foolishly? They have played tricks on you and changed you from men to idols, because you have persuaded yourselves that you will reign with Christ like kings and princes and that angels will serve you. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that whoever wants to be great in heaven should be a servant? So you have to learn what 'kings and princes and reigning with Christ' means. It means being wise and doing useful things, for the kingdom of Christ, which is heaven, is the kingdom of usefulness. For the Lord loves everyone, so He wants what is good for everyone, and good is usefulness. Since the Lord does good, or useful, things indirectly through angels and through people in the world, He gives a love of usefulness to those who are faithfully useful, and its reward is inward blessedness - which is eternal happiness.<p>"In the heavens, just as on earth, there is preeminent dominion and boundless wealth, for there are governments and forms of government, so there are greater and lesser powers and dignities.<p>And for those in the highest positions there are palaces and courts whose magnificence and splendor outdoes the palaces and courts of emperors and kings on earth. And due to the number of courtiers, ministers, and attendants, as well as their splendid clothing, they have overflowing honor and glory. But the highest ones of them are chosen from people whose hearts are in the public good.<p>Only their bodily senses are involved in the abundance that goes with nobility - and only to command obedience.<p>"Anything anyone does that is useful contributes to the public good in society, which is like the public's body, and all the useful things that angels and people do as if on their own are from the Lord, so clearly this is reigning with the Lord."<p>When they heard these words come out of heaven, those pretended kings and princes climbed down from the thrones and official seats and threw away their scepters, crowns, and robes.<p>The mist with its aura of fantasy left them, and a bright cloud veiled them over with an aura of wisdom, which brought sanity back to their minds. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #7 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>7. After this he summoned the company of the wise, so called, who made heavenly joys and eternal happiness therefrom to consist in supereminent dominion and boundless wealth, and in super-regal magnificence and super-illustrious splendor; and this because it is said in the Word that they shall be kings and princes, that they shall reign with Christ forever, and that they shall be ministered to by angels; besides much else. To these men the angel said: "Follow me and I will introduce you into your joys."<p>He then introduced them into a portico constructed with columns and pyramids. Fronting it was a low palace through which the way opened into the portico. It was through this palace that he introduced them. And lo! men were seen, twenty here and twenty there, all waiting in expectation. Then suddenly, one who personated an angel was present, and said to them, "Through this portico lies the way to heaven. Wait a little and prepare yourselves; for the elder among you are to be kings, and the younger, princes."</p><p>[2] When this had been said, then, beside each column appeared a throne, and upon the throne a silken robe, and upon the robe a scepter and a crown; and beside each pyramid appeared a chair of state, raised three cubits from the ground, and on each chair a chain with golden links, and the ribbon of an order of knighthood, joined at the ends with clasps of diamonds. Then a voice cried out, "Come, now, robe yourselves, take your seats, and wait."<p>Instantly the older men ran to the thrones, and the younger to the chairs of state, and putting on their robes sat down. There was then seen a kind of mist rising up from the lower regions; and from inhaling this mist, the faces of those sitting on the thrones and chairs began to be puffed up and their chests to be swollen and themselves filled with confidence that now they were kings and princes. This mist was an aura of the fantasy with which they were inspired. Suddenly young men flew to them, as if from heaven, and stood, two behind each throne, and one behind each chair, ready to wait on them; and then from time to time, proclamation was made by a herald: "Ye kings and princes, wait yet a little while. Your palaces in heaven are now being prepared. Courtiers with a retinue will presently come and introduce you." They waited and waited until their spirits panted for breath and they were utterly wearied with desire.</p><p>[3] After three hours, heaven was opened above their heads, and angels looked down, and having compassion on them, said: "Why sit ye thus foolish and play the part of actors? They have been playing tricks with you, and have changed you from men to idols, because you have set your hearts upon the idea that you are to reign with Christ as kings and princes, and are to be ministered to by angels. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that he who wishes to be great in heaven becomes a servant? Learn then what is meant by kings and princes, and what by reigning with Christ. It is to be wise and perform uses, the kingdom of Christ, which is heaven, being a kingdom of uses; for the Lord loves all men, and from love wills good to all, and good is use. And because the Lord does goods or uses mediately through angels, and in the world through men, therefore to those who perform uses faithfully He gives the love of use and the reward thereof, which is internal blessedness; and this is eternal happiness.</p><p>[4] In the heavens as on earth there is pre-eminent dominion and boundless wealth; for there are governments there, and forms of governments, and therefore greater and lesser powers and dignities. And these who are in the highest dignity have palaces and courts excelling in magnificence and splendor the palaces and courts of emperors and kings on earth; and, from the number of their courtiers, ministers, and attendants, and the splendor of their apparel, honor and glory surround them. But the highest among them are chosen from those whose heart is in the public welfare, it being [to] the bodily senses alone that they are in the fullness of magnificence, and this for the sake of obedience. And since it is for the public welfare that every one in a society, as in one common body, shall be of some use, and since every use is from the Lord and is done through angels and men as if by them, it is evident that this is what is meant by reigning with the Lord."<p>On hearing these words from heaven, the impersonated kings and princes came down from their thrones and chairs of state and threw away their scepters, crowns, and robes. The mist wherein was the aura of fantasy then departed from them, and a bright cloud, wherein was an aura of wisdom, veiled them about, and from this aura sanity returned to their minds. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #7 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>7. After this the angel summoned the company of the reputedly wise who had placed heavenly joys and the eternal happiness therefrom in supreme power, limitless wealth, a more than regal magnificence and a more than brilliant splendor, all because we read in the Word that men are to be kings and princes, reign. <sup >1</sup>with Christ to eternity, and be ministered to by angels, with much else to the same effect. To these the angel said, "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joys."<p>He led them to a portico of pillars and pyramids. A low palace in front of it gave access to it. Led through this by the angel, they saw groups of twenty waiting. Suddenly, an impersonated angel appeared, who told them, "The way to heaven lies through this portico. Wait a while, and prepare yourselves, for the older among you are to be kings, the younger, princes."</p><p>[2] At these words there appeared beside each pillar a throne, and on the throne a silken cloak, and on the cloak a scepter and a crown. Beside each pyramid there appeared a chair of state, three cubits high, and on each chair a gold chain and the ribbon of a knightly order with circlets of diamonds for clasps. Proclamation was made: "Come, array yourselves, be seated, and wait!"<p>Instantly the older men ran to the thrones, and the younger to the chairs of state, arrayed themselves, and sat down. Then a mist seemed to come up from below. As the occupants of the thrones and chairs breathed the mist, their faces puffed up, their breasts swelled, and they felt sure that they were kings and princes. The mist was only an aura of the phantasy which inspired them. Young men suddenly flew down, as if from heaven, and took posts, two at a throne, one at a chair of state, to serve as pages. From time to time a herald cried: "Ye kings and princes, wait yet a little while. Your courts in heaven are being made ready for you. Courtiers with a retinue will soon attend and introduce you." They waited and waited, until their spirits gasped for breath, and they were worn out with desire.</p><p>[3] After three hours heaven opened above them, and angels looked down and, moved to pity, said, "Why do you sit there so foolish and indulge in these theatricals? They have made game of you, and turned you from men into statues, all because your hearts are persuaded that you will reign with Christ as kings and princes and will be ministered to by angels. Have you forgotten the Lord's words <sup >2</sup>that he who would be great in heaven must be as a servant? Learn then what is meant by 'kings' and princes' and by 'reigning with Christ,' namely, to be wise and do uses. The kingdom of Christ, or heaven, is a kingdom of uses. For the Lord loves all and out of love wills good to all, and good is use. Inasmuch as the Lord does uses or goods through the instrumentality of angels and in the world through the instrumentality of men, He imparts to those who do uses faithfully the love of use and its reward, which is internal beatitude, and this is eternal happiness.</p><p>[4] Supreme power and boundless wealth are to be found in heaven as in the world, for governments exist there, greater and less, and therefore greater and lesser powers and dignities. Occupants of the highest posts have palaces and courts far surpassing in magnificence and splendor those of earthly kings and emperors. Honor and glory surround them in the splendid raiment and the number of their courtiers, ministers and attendants. Still, rulers are chosen from among those whose hearts are in the public welfare - their bodily senses only are in this display of magnificence, for the sake of obedience to authority. The public welfare requires that every member of a society, as of any general body, shall serve a use; and as every use is from the Lord, and is accomplished through angel or man as if by effort of his own, obviously to reign with the Lord means to perform a use."<p>On hearing these words from heaven, the mimic kings and princes quit their thrones and chairs and flung away their scepters, crowns and cloaks. The mist in which was the aura of phantasy receded, and a bright cloud enveloped them, in which was an aura of wisdom, restoring sanity to their minds.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_26.htm">Matthew 20:26</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #7 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>7. After this he called to him the company of the wise, so-called, who made heavenly joys and eternal happiness therefrom to consist in super-eminent dominion and boundless wealth, and in more than regal magnificence and more than illustrious splendor, because it is said in the Word, among other things, that they shall be kings and princes, and that they shall reign with Christ forever, and be ministered unto by the angels, with many other things. The angel said to them:<p>'Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joys.'<p>And he brought them in to a portico constructed with columns and pyramids. In front of it was a lower palace through, which the way opened into the portico. Through this he introduced them. And lo! twenty here and twenty there were seen waiting. And then suddenly one appeared who personated an angel; and he said to them, 'Through this portico is the way to heaven. Stay a little while and prepare yourselves; for the elder among you are to be kings, and the younger men princes.'<p>When this was said there appeared by each column a throne, upon the throne a robe of silk, and upon the robe a scepter and a crown; and by each pyramid there appeared a chair of state, elevated some three cubits from the ground, and on the chair a chain with links of gold, and the ribbon of an order of knighthood joined at the ends with circlets of diamonds. And then it was proclaimed, 'Go now, enrobe yourselves, be seated, and wait.'<p>And immediately the elder men hastened to the thrones, and the younger to the chairs of state, and put on their robes and sat down. And then there appeared as it were a mist ascending from beneath, from inhaling which those sitting upon the thrones and chairs began to swell in the face and to be puffed up as to their chest and filled with the confidence that now they were kings and princes. The mist was an aura of the phantasy with which they were inspired. And suddenly young men flew to them, as if from heaven, and stood two behind each throne and one behind each chair of state, to minister. And then by turns some herald cried out, 'Ye kings and princes, wait yet a little while. Your palaces are now being prepared in heaven. Courtiers with a retinue will presently come and conduct you in.' They waited and waited until their spirits panted for breath and they were utterly wearied with eager longing.<p>After three hours, heaven was opened above their heads, and angels looked down and having compassion on them said,<p>'Why do you sit so foolish, and take an actor's part? They have been playing tricks upon you, and have changed you from men to idols, because you have set your hearts upon the idea that you are to reign with Christ as kings and princes, and are to be ministered unto by the angels. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that he who would be great in heaven must become a servant? Learn then what is meant by kings and princes, and by reigning with Christ, that it is to be wise and perform uses; for the kingdom of Christ, which is heaven, is a kingdom of uses. For the Lord loves all, and from love wills good to all, and good is use. And as the Lord does goods or uses mediately through the angels, and in the world through men, therefore, to them that perform uses faithfully He gives the love of use and its reward, which is internal blessedness; and this is eternal happiness. In the heavens as on earth there is pre-eminent dominion and boundless wealth; for there are governments and forms of governments, and therefore, there are greater and lesser powers and dignities. And those who are in the highest dignity have palaces and courts, which in magnificence and splendor excel the palaces and courts of emperors and kings on earth; and they are surrounded with honor and glory from the number of courtiers, ministers, and attendants, and the splendor of their apparel. But the highest among these are chosen from them whose heart is in the public welfare, and whose bodily senses only are in the grandeur of magnificence for the sake of obedience. And as it is for the public welfare that everyone in a society as in a common body shall be of some use, and as every use is from the Lord, and is done by angels and men as if of themselves, it is plain that this is to reign with the Lord.'<p>Hearing these words from heaven the mimic kings and princes descended from their thrones and chairs of state, threw down their scepters, crowns, and robes; and the mist wherein was the aura of phantasy departed from them, and a bright cloud over-veiled them wherein was an aura of wisdom, whereby sanity was restored to their minds. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #7 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>7. Post haec ad se vocavit Cohortem Sapientum ita dictorum, qui Gaudia coelestia, et ex his Felicitatem aeternam, in supereminentibus Dominiis, ac opulentissimis Gazis, inque super-regia magnificentia, et super-illustri splendore, posuerant, ex causa, quia in Verbo dicitur, quod futuri sint reges et principes, et quod regnaturi sint cum Christo in aeternum, et quod ministrandi sint ab Angelis, praeter plura: Angelus ad hos dixit, "sequiminini, et introducam vos in vestra gaudia;" et introduxit in Porticum constructum ex columnis et pyramidibus: antrorsum erat humile Palatium, per quod patuit ingressus in Porticum; per hoc introduxit illos; et ecce visi sunt viginti hic et viginti ibi, et exspectabant: et subito tunc aderat quidam personatus Angelus, et dixit illis, "per hunc Porticum est via ad Coelum; manete aliquantisper, et praeparate vos, quia majorennes ex vobis futuri sunt reges, ac minorennes futuri Principes."</p><p>[2] His dictis, juxta quamlibet Columnam apparuit Thronus, et super throno chlamys ex serico, et super chlamyde sceptrum et corona; et juxta quamlibet Pyramidem apparuit Solium tres cubitos a terra elevatum, et super solio catena ex unculis auri, et equestris ordinis fasciae, colligatae ad fines adamantinis orbiculis. Et tunc clamatum est, "ite nunc, amicite vos, sedete et exspectate:" et actutum Majorennes accurrebant ad thronos, et Minorennes ad solia, et amiciverunt se, et reposuerunt se: at tunc apparuit sicut nimbus ex inferis ascendens, ex quo attracto sedentes super thronis et soliis coeperunt tumescere facie, et elevari pectore, et impleri fiducia, quod nunc reges et principes sint; nimbus ille erat aura phantasiae, qua inspirati sunt: et subito advolarunt juvenes sicut ex Coelo, et constiterunt duo post quemlibet thronum, et unus post quodlibet solium, ministraturi; et tunc per vices a quodam praecone acclamatum est, "vos reges et principes, exspectate adhuc parum, apparantur nunc in Coelo aulae vestrae, jamjam venturi sunt aulici cum satellitiis, et vos introducturi;" exspectabant et exspectabant, usque ut spiritus illorum anhelarent, et defatigarentur desiderio.</p><p>[3] Post trihorium aperiebatur Coelum supra caput illorum, et despexerunt Angeli, et miserti illorum, dixerunt, "quare sedetis ita fatui, et agitis histriones; luserunt ludibria vobiscum, et ab hominibus mutaverunt vos in idola, ex causa quia induxistis in corda vestra, quod regnaturi sitis cum Christo sicut reges et principes, et quod vobis tunc Angeli ministraturi sint: num obliti estis verborum Domini, quod in Coelo qui vult magnus esse, fiat servus: discite ergo, quid per reges et principes, et quid per regnare cum Christo, intelligitur, quod sit sapere et facere usus; Regnum enim Christi, quod est Coelum, est Regnum usuum; nam Dominus amat omnes, ac inde vult omnibus bonum, ac bonum est usus, et quia Dominus bona seu usus facit mediate per angelos, et in Mundo per homines, ideo illis, qui fideliter usus faciunt, dat amorem usus, et ejus mercedem, quae est beatitudo interna, et haec est felicitas aeterna.</p><p>[4] Sunt in Coelis, sicut in terris, supereminentia Dominia, et opulentissimae Gazae; sunt enim regimina et regiminum formae, et ideo sunt majores et minores potestates et dignitates; et illis qui in supremis sunt, sunt Palatia et Curiae, quae magnificentia et splendore excedunt palatia et curias Imperatorum et Regum in terris, et ex numero aulicorum, ministrorum, et satellitum, et ex horum magnificis investimentis, circumfluit illos honor et gloria: sed Supremi illi sunt electi ex illis, quorum cor est in salute publica, et solum sensus corporis in amplitudine magnificentiae propter obedientiam: et quia salutis publicae est, ut quisque sit aliquis usus in societate, ut in communi corpore, et quia omnis usus est a Domino, et fit per angelos et per homines sicut ab illis, patet quod hoc sit regnare cum Domino." His auditis e Coelo, personati illi reges et principes descenderunt e thronis et soliis, et abjecerunt sceptra, coronas, et chlamydes; et recessit ab illis nimbus, in quo fuit aura phantasiae, et obvelavit illos nubes candida, in qua erat aura sapientiae, ex qua rediit sanitas mentibus illorum. </p>
