<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第342节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>342、⑼伊斯兰天堂位于基督天堂的外围，被分成一个高层天堂和一个低层天堂；除了那些放弃妃嫔或妾室，只与一位妻子生活，并承认我们主等同于父神，天上地上的权柄被赋予祂的人外，没有人能被提入他们的高层天堂。在分别论述这些天堂之前，预先说明主关于伊斯兰教兴起的圣治是很重要的。信奉伊斯兰教的国家比信奉基督教的还多，这一事实让那些思想圣治，同时认为除了生而为基督徒的人外，没有人能得救之人觉得很尴尬。但对那些相信万事万物皆遵从圣治的人来说，伊斯兰教并不是一个心理障碍。这些人会调查其中原由，然后找出答案。答案就是：伊斯兰教承认我们主是神的儿子，最有智慧的人，一个非常伟大的先知，祂降世教导人类。不过，他们将《可兰经》奉为其宗教的唯一经典，结果它的作者穆罕默德也成了他们思想的对象，以致他们将某种敬拜投向他，却很少关心我们的主。为叫人们充分了解该宗教由主的圣治兴起，是为了除灭众多民族当中的偶像崇拜，有必要按一定次序来阐述；故先从偶像崇拜的起源说起。<br><br>伊斯兰教兴起之前，偶像崇拜遍及全世界。原因在于，主降世前的所有教会都是代表性教会。以色列教会也是这种：它的会幕、亚伦的衣服、祭物，耶路撒冷圣殿的一切细节，包括它的律例典章，都是代表。古人还掌握对应学，它也是代表的知识，被视为知识的最高形式，是智者的学问。对应学在埃及特别发达，并形成其象形文字的基础。他们正是凭着对应学知道各种动物和树木的含义，以及大山小山、河流源泉、日月星辰的含义。此外，对应学是他们用来认识属灵事物的工具。因为它们所代表的事物，也就是构成天上天使所拥有的属灵智慧的那类事物，是这些物体的起源。<br><br>他们的一切敬拜因纯由对应构成，故而都是代表；所以他们在大山和小山上，以及果园和花园里举行敬拜。也正因如此，他们视源泉为圣，祷告时面向升起的太阳。此外，他们雕刻了马、牛、牛犊、羔羊，甚至鸟类，鱼类和蛇类的形像，把这些东西摆在自己家里及别处，并照着它们所对应或代表的教会属灵事物按一定次序摆列。他们还将类似事物摆在圣殿，以便回想起它们所表示的敬拜的神圣观念。随着时间推移，当对应学逐渐被抹去时，他们的后代开始敬拜雕像本身，视之为神圣。殊不知，古人，就是他们的祖先并未在它们里面看到一丝神圣，只是因为它们照着对应关系代表，并由此表示神圣观念。这就是充斥全世界，包括亚洲及其附近岛屿，以及非洲和欧洲的偶像崇拜的起源。<br><br>为将所有这些偶像崇拜连根拔除，主的圣治料到，要开创一个适合东方人秉性的新宗教；这个新宗教当有出自新旧约的某些内容，当教导主降世，祂是一个非常伟大的先知，最有智慧的人，是神的儿子。这事通过穆罕默德来成就，该宗教也以他的名字命名。综上所述，明显可知，如我所说的，伊斯兰教由主的圣治兴起，并迁就东方人的秉性，旨在除灭众多民族的偶像崇拜，在他们进入灵界（每个人死后即发生）之前，传给他们有关主的一些知识。该宗教若不符合他们原有的观念，尤其不允许一夫多妻制，就不会被那么多国家接受，也就无法根除他们的偶像崇拜。此外，一夫多妻制之所以被允许，是因为没有这种允许，东方人出于燃烧的淫欲，早就冲进污秽的淫行了，比欧洲人更甚，并且也早就灭亡了。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>342、（9）在讲述这点之前，我们要先说一下穆斯林宗教的产生背景。</p><p>穆斯林宗教被很多国家接受，甚至多于基督教国家。这就造成了一个问题，人们会认为只有基督徒才会被拯救。但穆斯林的宗教对那些认为一切都是神意的人却不是问题。这些人会探究神为什么这样安排。</p><p>在此，神在这方面的意图可以这样理解。穆斯林承认我们的主是神的儿子，是最明智的人，是最伟大的使徒，他来到世间来教导人类。但是穆斯林将《古兰经》视为唯一的信仰。因为写《古兰经》的穆哈默德固存于他们心中，他们会比崇拜主更崇拜穆哈默德。</p><p>进一步了解主为什么让伊斯兰教兴起，来阻止许多国家对偶像的崇拜，我们还要了解以下。首先，从偶象崇拜方面考虑。</p><p>在伊斯兰教兴起之前，偶像崇拜普遍存在。这是因为主到来之前的教会都是象征性的教会。以色列的教会也是这样的。圣殿，亚伦的法衣、祭祀，耶路撒冷的庙宇，以及塑像，都是象征性的。另外，在古时的人中，他们懂得象征意义。那些智者更是通晓象征方面的知识。埃及人发明了这种符号，后来演变成了象形文字。</p><p>从对象征意义的知识他们知道，动物、树木、山川、河流、泉眼等以及太阳、月亮和星星都有其象征意义。通过这种知识，他们有了一种对精神事物的认识。因为这些象征知识是天使们所具有的神的智慧。</p><p>因为他们的崇拜是象征性的，只是由象征来表现，因此他们的祭祀会在山顶举行，或会在山谷或花园中举行。他们还会敬拜泉水，会在崇拜时面向初升的太阳。另外他们雕刻出马、牛、羊、鱼、蛇等并将它们放在房屋等处。用它们来反映教会中对应的精神事物。他们还将这些东西放在庙宇中，用来表现他们祭祀中的神圣因素。</p><p>随着时间的推移，他们对象征的知识开始丧失。他们开始将雕的偶像做为圣物来崇拜，而不知道古时人们并不认为这些偶像本身有什么神圣之处，而只有它们的象征意义才是神圣所在。因此，对偶像的崇拜产生了，并充斥于世，充满于亚洲及其周边的岛屿，以及非洲及欧洲。</p><p>为了抵制偶像崇拜，主介绍了一种新的适于东方人理解的宗教。在这一宗教中，有来自于《新约》、《旧约》中的东西。这一宗教告诉人们主来到世间，他是个伟大的使徒，是个最明智的人，是神的儿子。这是通过穆哈默得而实现的。因这一宗教又被称为穆哈黑德派。</p><p>由此可见，伊斯兰教的兴起是神意，它是适应那些东方人的，是为了阻止许多国家中的偶像崇拜。为了那些人能在进入精神世界前了解主。这一宗教不会起到以上作用，除非它是能够让人们容易地接受的。尤其是若一夫多妻不被允许，那时的东方人会比欧洲人更变得淫乱并消亡。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #342 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>342. (ix) The Mohammedan heaven lies outside the Christian heaven, and is divided into a higher and a lower heaven. None are raised to their higher heaven except those who forswear mistresses, and live with one wife, and acknowledge our Lord as the equal of God the Father, to whom dominion over heaven and earth is given.<p>Before dealing with any of these topics separately, it is important by way of preface to say something about the Lord's Divine providence as concerns the rise of the Mohammedan religion. The fact that the kingdoms accepting this religion outnumber those accepting the Christian may seem scandalous to those who think about Divine providence, and at the same time believe that no one who was not born a Christian can be saved. But the Mohammedan religion is no scandal to those who believe that everything is subject to Divine providence. These people look to see in what respect this is so, and they find the answer. It is that the Mohammedan religion acknowledges our Lord as the Son of God, the wisest of men, and as a very great prophet, who came into the world to teach mankind. But since they have made the Koran their bible, and so Mohammed its author has become the object of their thoughts, so that they devote some worship to him, they pay little heed to our Lord. To make it fully known that this religion has been developed of the Lord's Divine providence in order to suppress idolatry among a number of nations, I must take the points in order; so first, on the origin of idolatrous practices.</p><p>[2] Before the Mohammedan religion existed, the worship of idols was widespread throughout the world. The reason was that all the churches which existed before the Lord's coming were representative ones. This is what the Israelite church was: its tabernacle, Aaron's vestments, the sacrifices, every detail of the Temple in Jerusalem, as well as its laws, were representative. Ancient peoples too possessed a knowledge of correspondences, which is also that of representations. This was to them the highest form of knowledge, and it was particularly developed by the Egyptians, and formed the basis of their hieroglyphs. It was this knowledge which enabled them to know the meaning of every kind of animal, every kind of tree, the meaning of mountains, hills, rivers and springs, of the sun, the moon and the stars. This knowledge was the means by which they knew about spiritual matters. For the things they represented, which are the kind of things that make up the spiritual wisdom possessed by angels in heaven, were the origins of these objects.</p><p>[3] Now since all their worship was representative, being composed of nothing but correspondences, they practised their worship on mountains and hills, as well as in parks and gardens. For this reason too they regarded springs as sacred, and in praying turned their faces towards the rising sun. Moreover, they made carved images of horses, cattle, calves, lambs, even birds, fishes and snakes. They placed these in their homes and elsewhere, arranged in sequence to match the spiritual ideas of the church to which they corresponded, that is, what they represented. They placed similar things also in their temples to recall to memory the holy ideas of worship for which they stood. In later times, when the knowledge of correspondences had been wiped out, their descendants began to worship the actual carvings as being themselves holy, being unaware that their ancestors had seen no holiness in them, merely regarding them as representing and meaning holy ideas in accordance with their correspondences. This was the origin of the idolatrous practices which filled the whole world, Asia and its surrounding islands, as well as Africa and Europe.</p><p>[4] In order to root out these idolatrous practices, the Lord's Divine providence saw to it that a new religion should be founded which suited the character of oriental peoples. In it there should be something from both Testaments of the Word, and it should teach that the Lord came into the world, and that He was a very great prophet, the wisest of all, and the Son of God. This was accomplished through Mohammed, who gave the religion his name. This makes it plain that this religion developed of the Lord's Divine providence, and, as I said, it was designed to suit the character of oriental peoples, with the object of wiping out the idolatrous practices of so many nations, and of conveying to them some knowledge about the Lord before they arrived in the spiritual world, as happens to everyone after death. It could not have been accepted by so many kingdoms and have rooted out their idolatry, if it had not been in keeping with the ideas they had; and in particular, unless polygamy had been permitted, because without that permission oriental peoples would, more than Europeans, have been fired with lust for foul adulteries, and would have perished. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #342 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>342. 9. The Muslim heaven exists outside the Christian heaven and is divided into two heavens, a lower and a higher; and only those Muslims are raised up into their higher heaven who renounce concubines, live with one wife, and acknowledge our Lord as equal to God the Father, who has given Him dominion over heaven and earth. Before we say anything about this specifically, it is important that we premise something about the Lord's Divine providence respecting the rise of the Muslim religion.<p>The Muslim religion has been adopted by many more countries than the Christian religion, and this may pose a problem for people who think about Divine providence and at the same time believe that no one else can be saved but one who has been born a Christian. But the Muslim religion is not a problem to those who believe that all things are of Divine providence. Such people inquire into where it lies, and moreover discover it.<p>The Divine providence in the present instance lies in this, that the Muslim religion acknowledges our Lord as the Son of God, the wisest of men, and as a very great prophet, who came into the world to teach mankind. However, because they made the Koran their only book of religion, and because Muhammad who wrote the book therefore settled in their thoughts, whom they follow with some degree of worship, therefore they think little about our Lord.<p>To have it fully known that this religion was raised up of the Lord's Divine providence, to put an end to the idolatries of many nations, we need consider it in some order. First, then, regarding the origin of idolatrous worship:</p><p>[2] Before the Muslim religion arose, worship of idols existed throughout the world. The reason for this was that the churches before the Lord's Advent were all representational churches. The Israelite Church was even such a church. The Tabernacle in it, the vestments of Aaron, the sacrifices, all the appointments of the Temple at Jerusalem, and moreover the statutes, were representative. Furthermore, among the ancients there was a knowledge of correspondences, which includes a knowledge of representations. It was the principal study of the wise, cultivated especially by the Egyptians, from which came their hieroglyphics.<p>From that study they knew what animals of every kind symbolized, also trees of every kind, likewise mountains, hills, rivers, springs, and so too the sun, moon and stars. Through that knowledge they had a cognizance of spiritual things as well, since the concepts thus represented were such things as are matters of spiritual wisdom in angels and were the origins of the representations.</p><p>[3] Now because all of their worship was representational, consisting of nothing but correspondent forms, therefore they held rites of worship on mountains and hills, and likewise in groves and gardens. Therefore they also consecrated springs, and in their venerations turned their faces to the rising eastern sun. Moreover they made carved images of horses, oxen, calves, lambs, indeed of birds, fishes, and serpents, and placed these in their houses and elsewhere, setting them in an order to reflect that of the spiritual things of the church to which they corresponded or which they represented. They also placed objects like these in their temples, to recall to mind the sacred elements in their worship which they symbolized.<p>In the course of time, when a knowledge of correspondences became extinguished, their posterity began to worship the carved figures themselves as sacred in themselves, not knowing that their ancient forebears did not see any intrinsic sacredness in them, but only that they represented and so symbolized sacred things by virtue of their correspondences. In consequence of this idolatries arose, which filled the whole world, both the Asiatic world with its surrounding islands and the African and European worlds.</p><p>[4] In order to eradicate all these idolatries, of the Lord's Divine providence it came to pass that a new religion was introduced, suited to the native characters of orientals, in which there would be something from each of the two Testaments of the Word; a religion which would teach that the Lord came into the world, and that He was a very great prophet, the wisest of all men, and the Son of God. This was accomplished through Muhammad, from whom this religion received the name Muhammadanism.<p>It is apparent from this that this religion was raised up of the Lord's Divine providence and suited, as said, to the native characters of orientals, in order to put an end to the idolatries of so many nations, and to provide them with some awareness of the Lord before they came into the spiritual world, as happens with everyone after death. This religion would not have been adopted by so many countries, and would not have been able to eradicate their idolatries, unless it was conformable to their ideas. Especially not, had not polygamy been permitted; and this for the additional reason that, without that permission, orientals would have blazed up more than Europeans into foul adulteries and perished. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #342 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>342. 9. The Mohammedan heaven is outside the Christian heaven, and it is divided into two heavens, a lower one and a higher one, and only the ones who give up concubines and live with one wife and acknowledge our Lord as equal with God the Father, who has power over heaven and earth, are raised into the higher heaven. First, before saying anything particular about these points, it is important to put in something about the Lord's Divine Providence in respect to the source of the Mohammedan religion. The fact that this religion is accepted in more countries than the Christian religion could be a stumbling block to people who consider the Divine Providence and believe, at the same time, that only people who are born Christians can be saved. But the Mohammedan religion is not a stumbling block to those who believe that everything is under Divine Providence.<p>They investigate where Providence is, and they do find it. It is in the fact that the Mohammedan religion recognizes our Lord as the Son of God, the wisest of men, and as the greatest prophet, who came into the world to teach people. But they make the Koran the only book of their religion, and therefore Mohammed, who wrote it, occupies their thoughts, and they follow him with a kind of worship, so they do not think about our Lord very much.<p>Now to explain in an organized way that the Lord's Divine Providence stimulated that religion to abolish many nations' idolatries, so it will be clearly understood.<p>First, then, about the source of idolatries. Before that religion there was idol worship throughout the world. The reason was that all the churches before the Lord's advent were symbolic. The Israelite church was also like that. The Tabernacle in it, Aaron's clothes, the sacrifices, everything in the temple at Jerusalem, and the laws as well - were symbolic. And among the ancient people there was knowledge of correspondences, which is also knowledge of symbols - precisely the knowledge of wise men - cultivated especially by the Egyptians. This is where hieroglyphics came from.<p>From knowledge of symbols they knew what all kinds of animals and all kinds of trees, and also what mountains, hills, rivers, springs, and the sun, moon, and stars stood for. Through this knowledge they also had a grasp of spiritual things, inasmuch as the things that were represented - the kind of things that have to do with spiritual wisdom in angels - were the sources of it. Now, because all their worship was symbolic (it consisted of pure correspondences) they held worship on mountains and hills, and also in groves and gardens. And for the same reason they made springs sacred, and in their prayers they turned their faces to the rising sun. And they also sculpted horses, oxen, calves, lambs - even birds, fish, and snakes. They put these in their houses and other places, arranged according to the spiritual things having to do with religion that they corresponded to or symbolized. They also put these things in their temples to call to mind the holy aspects of worship that the images stood for. After a time, when the knowledge of correspondences was forgotten, their descendants began to worship the same sculptures as holy in themselves, not realizing that their ancient ancestors saw nothing holy in them except that they symbolized things by correspondence and for that reason stood for holy things. The idolatries that filled the whole world - Asia with the islands around it, as well as Africa and Europe - sprang from this chain of events.<p>To root out all those idolatries, it came about in the Lord's Divine Providence that a new religion suited to the spirit of the Middle Eastern people was begun - a religion that would have something of each Testament of the Word in it and would teach that the Lord came into the world and that He is the greatest prophet, the wisest of all, and the son of God. This was done through Mohammed, so the religion has that name.<p>These things make it clear that the Lord's Divine Providence<p>purposely brought to life this religion suited to the nature of the Middle Eastern people, as was said, to blot out the idolatries of so many nations and provide them some knowledge of the Lord before their coming into the spiritual world - which happens after each person's death. This religion would not have been accepted by so many nations and could not have rooted out their idolatries unless it had been accommodated their ideas - above all, unless polygamy had been allowed. Another reason: the Middle Eastern people, more than Europeans, would have been afflicted with foul adulteries and would have been lost. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #342 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>342. IX. THAT THE MOHAMMEDAN HEAVEN IS OUTSIDE THE CHRISTIAN HEAVEN, AND IS DIVIDED INTO TWO HEAVENS, A LOWER AND A HIGHER; AND THAT NO OTHERS ARE ELEVATED INTO THEIR HIGHER HEAVEN SAVE THOSE WHO RENOUNCE CONCUBINES, LIVE WITH ONE WIFE, AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR LORD, TO WHOM IS GIVEN DOMINION OVER HEAVEN AND EARTH, AS EQUAL WITH GOD THE FATHER. Before anything is said in particular respecting these heavens, it is important that something be premised concerning the Lord's Divine Providence in relation to the rise of the Mohammedan religion. The fact that this religion has been received by more kingdoms than have received the Christian religion may be a stumbling-block to those who think of Divine Providence and at the same time believe that no one can be saved but he who is born a Christian. The Mohammedan religion, however, is not a stumbling-block to those who believe that all things are of Divine Providence. These inquire wherein this Providence lies; moreover, they find it lies in this: That the Mohammedan religion acknowledges our Lord as the Son of God, as the wisest of men, and as the great prophet who came into the world that he might teach men. But because the Mohammedans make the Koran the only book of their religion, and Mohammed, who wrote it, is therefore inseated in their thoughts, they follow him with a kind of worship, and think little about our Lord. That it may be fully known that of the Lord's Divine Providence that religion was raised up for the wiping out of the idolatries of many nations, this shall be told in some order.</p><p>[2] First, then, respecting the origin of idolatries. Previous to that religion, the worship of idols existed in all countries, and this because previous to the coming of the Lord all churches were representative. Such also was the Israelitish Church. There the tabernacle, Aaron's garments, the sacrifices, all that was in the temple at Jerusalem, and also the statues, were representative. Moreover, with the ancients, the science of correspondences, which is also the science of representations, was the science of the wise. This was especially cultivated by the Egyptians; hence their hieroglyphics. From this science they knew what was signified by animals of every kind, and by trees of every kind, and also by mountains, hills, rivers, and fountains, and by the sun, moon, and stars. Moreover, by this science they had a knowledge of things spiritual; for the things which were represented, being such as are matters of spiritual wisdom with the angels, were the origins of the representations.</p><p>[3] Now because all their worship was representative, consisting of mere correspondences, therefore they held that worship on mountains and hills, and also in groves and gardens. Therefore also they consecrated fountains, and in their adorations turned their faces to the rising sun. Moreover, they made sculptured horses, oxen, calves, lambs, yea, birds, fishes, serpents; and these they placed in their houses and elsewhere, in an order according to the spiritual things of the Church to which they corresponded or which they represented. They also placed them in their temples, that they might call to mind the holy things of worship which they signified. In course of time, when the science of correspondences had been obliterated, their posterity began to worship the sculptured images as holy in themselves, not knowing that the ancients, their fathers of old, saw nothing holy in them, seeing only that they represented and thence signified holy things according to correspondences. Hence arose idolatries, and these filled the whole world, as well Asia with its surrounding islands as Africa and Europe.</p><p>[4] That all these idolatries might be uprooted, it was brought to pass of the Lord's Divine Providence that there should be inaugurated a new religion accommodated to the genius of the orientals; a religion in which there would be something from both Testaments of the Word, and which would teach that the Lord came into the world and that He was the great Prophet, the wisest of all, and the Son of God. This was done through Mohammed, from whom this religion has its name.<p>From the above it is evident that this religion, as was said, was raised up of the Lord's Divine Providence and accommodated to the genius of the orientals, to the end that it might wipe out the idolatries of so many nations, and might give them some knowledge of the Lord prior to their entrance into the spiritual world, which takes place with every one after death. This religion would not have been received by so many kingdoms, and could not have uprooted their idolatries, had it not been suited to their ideas, and especially had not polygamy been permitted. Moreover, this was permitted because without such permission the orientals, from burning heat, would have rushed into filthy adulteries more than Europeans, and would have perished. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #342 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>342. (ix) The Mohammedan heaven is outside the Christian heaven and is divided into two heavens, a lower and a higher. Only those are raised into their higher heaven who give up concubines and live with one wife and acknowledge our Lord, to whom the dominion over heaven and earth, is given, as equal with God the Father. Before we take up these several points we must premise some things about the Divine Providence over the rise of the Mohammedan religion. The prevalence of this religion in more nations than accept the Christian religion may be a stumbling-block to those who give thought to Divine Providence and at the same time believe that only those born Christians can be saved. The Mohammedan religion is no stumbling-block, however, to those who believe that all things are of Divine Providence. These ask and also discover in what the Providence consists. The Providence is this: the Mohammedan religion does acknowledge our Lord as the Son of God, as the wisest of men, and as a very great Prophet who came into the world to teach mankind. It is true, Mohammedans think little about our Lord, because they have made the Koran their one book of religion and hence have enthroned Mohammed, who wrote it, in their thought, and follow him with some worship. That it may be still more fully appreciated that Mohammedanism was raised up by the Lord's Divine Providence, it shall be shown in some order how it was raised up to destroy the idolatries of many peoples.</p><p>[2] First, something on the origin of idolatries. Before Mohammedanism there was idol-worship throughout the world. The reason was that the Churches before the Lord's advent were all representative Churches. The Israelitish Church was such a Church. The tabernacle in it, Aaron's garments, the sacrifices, all things of the Jerusalemite temple and the statutes, too, were representative. The ancients, moreover, possessed a knowledge of correspondences, which is also a knowledge of representatives; this was the special knowledge of the wise, cultivated by the Egyptians in particular - hence their hieroglyphics. As a result of this knowledge the ancients appreciated what animals of all kinds signified, likewise what trees of every kind meant, as also what mountains did, and hills, rivers, fountains; sun, moon and stars. They were acquainted with spiritual things by way of this knowledge, since the things represented were the origin, and are such things as belong to spiritual wisdom with the angels.</p><p>[3] And as all their worship was representative, consisting wholly of correspondences, they held it on mountains and hills and also in groves and gardens; they consecrated springs, and faced the rising sun in their adorations; they made images of horses, cows, calves, and lambs, yes, of birds, fish, and snakes, and placed these images in their homes and elsewhere in the order of the spiritual things of the Church, to which they corresponded or which they represented. They also placed similar sculptures in their temples, to put themselves in remembrance of the sacred things of worship, signified by them. In the course of time, when the knowledge of correspondences was obliterated, their posterity began to worship the sculptured images as holy, not knowing that their ancient forbears saw nothing holy in them, but only that they represented and hence signified holy things according to correspondences. So idolatries arose which filled the whole world, both Asia with the adjacent islands, and Africa and Europe.</p><p>[4] In order that all these idolatries might be uprooted, it happened under the Lord's Divine Providence that a new religion began, accommodated to the genius of the orientals, having something from each Testament of the Word, and teaching that the Lord had come into the world and that He was a very great prophet, the wisest of all men and the Son of God. This was effected through Mohammed, from whom that religion was named. Hence it is plain that Mohammedanism was raised up under the Lord's Divine Providence and, as we said, was accommodated to the genius of the orientals, in order that it might blot out the idolatries of so many peoples and give them some knowledge of the Lord before they should come, as all do on death, into the spiritual world. This religion would not have been accepted by so many kingdoms and could not have rooted out their idolatries, had it not been agreeable to their ideas, in particular had not polygamy been permitted. Furthermore, without that concession, orientals would have burned more than Europeans in filthy adultery and would have perished. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #342 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>342. (9) That the Mahometan heaven is outside the Christian heaven; and that it is divided into two heavens, a lower and a higher; and that none are elevated into their higher heaven but those who renounce concubines and live with one wife, and acknowledge our Lord as equal to God the Father to whom dominion is given over heaven and earth. Before anything is said in particular respecting these heavens, it is important that some things should first be said about the Lord's Divine Providence in relation to the rise of the Mahometan religion. That this religion was received by more kingdoms than the Christian religion may be a stumbling-block to those who think of Divine Providence, and at the same time believe that no one can be saved but he who is born a Christian. But the Mahometan religion is not a stumbling-block to those who believe that all things are of the Divine Providence. They inquire and also discover wherein it is [of Divine Providence]. It is in this: That the Mahometan religion acknowledges our Lord as the Son of God, as the wisest of men, and as a very great prophet, who came into the world that he might teach men. But as the Mahometans make the Koran only the book of their religion, and consequently Mahomet who wrote it is seated in their thoughts, and they follow him with a kind of worship, they therefore, think little about our Lord. That it may be fully known that that religion was raised up by the Lord's Divine Providence, for the destruction of the idolatries of many nations, it shall be explained in some order:<p>First, then, respecting the origin of idolatries: Before that religion there was the worship of idols in every country on earth. The cause of it was, that previous to the coming of the Lord the churches were all representative. Such also was the Israelitish Church; the tabernacle there, the garments of Aaron, the sacrifices, all things of the temple at Jerusalem, and the statutes also, were representative. And with the ancients the knowledge of correspondences, which is also the knowledge of representations, was the very knowledge of the wise, cultivated especially by the Egyptians. Hence their hieroglyphics. From this knowledge they knew what animals of every kind signified; as also trees of every kind.; and what mountains, hills, rivers, and fountains; and what the sun, the moon, and the stars signified. By that knowledge they also had cognition of things spiritual; because the things that were represented, which were such as are matters of spiritual wisdom with the angels, were their origins. Now as all their worship was representative, consisting only of correspondences, therefore, they held their worship upon mountains and hills, and also in groves and gardens; and for that reason they consecrated fountains, and in adorations turned their faces to the rising sun; and besides made sculptured horses, oxen, calves, lambs, yea, birds, fishes, serpents, and set them up at home and elsewhere in order, wording to the spiritual things of the church to which they corresponded, or which they represented. Similar objects they also placed in their temples, that they might call to remembrance the holy things of worship which they signified. In the course of time, when the knowledge of correspondences was obliterated, their posterity began to worship the sculptured images themselves, as in themselves holy, not knowing that the ancients, their forefathers, saw nothing holy in them, but only that they represented and therefore, signified holy things, according to correspondences. Hence arose the idolatries which filled all countries of the world, the Asiatic with the surrounding islands, the African, and the European.<p>That all these idolatries might be extirpated, it was brought to pass of the Lord's Divine Providence that a new religion should begin, accommodated to the genius of the orientals, in which there should be something from each Testament of the Word, and which should teach that the Lord came into the world, and that He was the greatest Prophet, the wisest of all, and the Son of God. This was done through Mahomet, from whom that religion has its name.<p>From this it is plain that this religion was raised up by the Lord's Divine Providence, and accommodated, as was said, to the genius of the orientals; to the end that it might destroy the idolatries of so many nations, and give them some knowledge of the Lord before they should come into the spiritual world, which takes place after death with everyone; which religion would not have been received by so many kingdoms, and could not have extirpated their idolatries, if it had not been accommodated to their ideas, especially if polygamy had not been permitted. This was permitted also for the reason that without that permission the orientals would have been inflamed with filthy adulteries more than Europeans, and would have perished. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #342 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>342. IX. Quod coelum Mahumedanum sit extra coelum Christianum, et quod illud in duos coelos, inferius et superius, sit divisum; et quod non alii in coelum illorum superius eleventur, quam qui abdicant pellices, et vivunt cum una uxore, et agnoscunt Dominum nostrum aequalem Deo Patri, cui dominium super coelum et terram datum est. Antequam de his aliquid singulariter dicitur, interest ut aliqua de Divina Domini Providentia circa ortum Religionis Mahumedanae praemittantur. Quod haec Religio recepta sit a pluribus Regnis, quam Religio Christiana, potest scandalo esse illis, qui de Divina Providentia cogitant, et simul credunt, quod non aliquis salvari possit, nisi qui Christianus natus est; at Religio Mahumedana non est scandalum illis, qui credunt, quod omnia sint Divinae Providentiae; hi inquirunt, in quo est, et quoque inveniunt. Est in eo, quod Mahumedana Religio agnoscat Dominum nostrum pro Filio Dei, Sapientissimo hominum, proque Maximo Propheta, qui in Mundum venit ut doceret homines; at quia Alcoranum modo Librum religionis suae fecerunt, et inde Mahumedes, qui illum conscripsit, cogitationibus illorum insedit, et aliquo cultu illum persequuntur, ideo parum de Domino nostro cogitant. Ut plene sciatur, quod illa Religio ex Divina Domini Providentia exsuscitata sit, ad delendum idololatrias plurium gentium, in aliquo ordine dicetur; quare primum de origine Idololatriarum.</p><p>[2] Ante illam Religionem fuit Cultus idolorum in toto terrarum Orbe; causa fuit, quia Ecclesiae ante Adventum Domini, fuerunt omnes Ecclesiae Repraesentativae; talis etiam fuit Ecclesia Israelitica; ibi Tabernaculum, Vestes Aharonis, Sacrificia, omnia Templi Hierosolymitani, et quoque Statuta repraesentabant: et apud Antiquos fuit scientia Correspondentiarum, quae etiam est Repraesentationum, ipsa Scientia sapientum, imprimis exculta ab Aegyptiis; inde horum Hieroglyphica. Ex illa Scientia sciverunt, quid significabant omnis generis Animalia, tum quid omnis generis Arbores, ut et quid Montes, Colles, Fluvii, Fontes, ut et quid Sol, Luna, et Stellae; per illam scientiam fuit illis etiam cognitio spiritualium, quoniam illa, quae repraesentabantur, quae fuerunt talia quae sapientiae spiritualis sunt apud Angelos, erant origines:</p><p>[3] nunc quia omnis Cultus illorum erat Repraesentativus, consistens ex meris Correspondentiis, ideo super montibus et collibus, et quoque in lucis et hortis, habuerunt Cultus; et ideo Fontes sanctificabant, et ad Solem Orientem in adorationibus converterunt facies; et insuper sculptiles equos, boves, vitulos, agnos, imo aves, pisces, serpentes, fecerunt; et hos posuerunt domi, et alibi, in ordine secundum spiritualia Ecclesiae, quibus correspondebant, seu quae repraesentabant: similia etiam posuerunt in suis Templis, ut in reminiscentiam revocarent Sancta cultus, quae significabant. Post tempus, quando Scientia correspondentiarum obliterata fuit, coepit Posteritas colere ipsa sculptilia ut in se sancta, nescientes quod Antiqui Parentes illorum non viderint aliquid sancti in illis, sed solum quod secundum correspondentias repraesentarent, et inde significarent sancta. Ex his ortae sunt Idololatriae, quae impleverunt totum terrarum Orbem, tam Asiaticum cum Insulis circum, quam Africanum, et Europaeum.</p><p>[4] Ut omnes illae Idololatriae exstirparentur, ex Divina Domini Providentia factum est, ut nova Religio geniis Orientalium accommodata auspicaretur; in qua aliquid ex utroque Testamento Verbi foret, et quae doceret quod Dominus in Mundum venerit, et quod Ille esset <sup>1</sup>maximus Propheta, Sapientissimus omnium, et Filius Dei: hoc factum est per Mahumedem, ex quo Religio illa vocata est. Ex his patet, quod haec Religio ex Divina Domini Providentia, exsuscitata sit, ac geniis Orientalium, ut dictum est, accommodata, ob finem, ut deleret Idololatrias tot gentium, ac daret aliquam cognitionem de Domino, antequam in Mundum spiritualem, quod fit post cujusvis mortem, venirent; quae Religio non recepta fuisset a tot Regnis, et potuisset idololatrias illorum exstirpare, nisi conveniens ideis illorum facta sit; imprimis nisi Polygamia permissa fuisset; etiam ex causa, quia Orientales, absque illa permissione prae Europaeis flagravissent in spurca adulteria, et periissent.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: essent </p>
