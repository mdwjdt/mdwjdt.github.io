<h4 align="center"></h4><p>37、⑷尤其两性情爱会保留下来，对将要进入天堂，即在世变得属灵之人而言，这爱就是婚姻之爱。人死后会保留两性情爱，因为那时男性还是男性，女性还是女性。男性特质存在于他的整体及每一部分中，女性特质同样如此。两性的每一细节，甚至最细微处都存在一种结合的本能。由于结合的本能自创造时就被植入并永久存在于两性中，故可知，他们各自都渴望和追求与对方结合。就其本身而言，爱无非是结合的渴望和努力，婚姻之爱则是合而为一的渴望和努力。男人和女人就是如此受造，以便他们二人成为一体。既为一体，合在一起的二者就是最完全意义上的人。不过，若无那结合，他们就是二，各自像是一个分开的人或半个人。由于结合的本能深藏于两性的每一部分，并且合为一体的能力和渴望也存在于每一部分，故可知，人死后仍保留对异性的彼此相爱。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>37、（4）尤其是对异性的爱还继续存在，也就是说进入天堂的人们还保存婚姻之爱。对异性的爱还继续存在，是因为人死后，女性还是女性，男性仍是男性，男性还拥有一个男性特征，女性还拥有一个女性特征，二者在每一方面都有相结合的可能。</p><p>因为两性相结合的特性始于创世之初，所以它将永远保存在两个性别之中，进而无论男性和女性都渴望与异性相结合。</p><p>爱就是对相结合的渴望和努力，婚姻之爱就是对合二为一的渴望。因为人类的男性和女性从创世起就能够成为一个躯体。当他们成为一个的时候，就成为完全意义的人。但若没有那种结合，他们还是两个人，每个人就是像是一个人被分成两份。</p><p>因为那种与生俱来的对相结合的渴望，存在于男性和女性的每一个细胞中，相结合的能能力表现在每一方面，因此相互对异性的爱在死后仍然存在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #37 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>37. (iv) The chief love is sexual love; and in the case of those who reach heaven, that is, those who become spiritual on earth, it is conjugial love.<p>The reason why a person's sexual love remains after death is that a male remains a male and a female remains a female, and the male's masculinity pervades the whole and every part of him, and likewise a female's femininity; and the impulse to be joined is present in every detail down to the smallest. Since that impulse to be joined was implanted from creation and is therefore continually present, it follows that the one desires the other and longs to be joined to the other. Love taken by itself is nothing but a desire and hence an impulse to be joined; conjugial love is an impulse to be joined into one. For the male and the female of the human species are so created as to be able to become like a single individual, that is, one flesh; and when united, then they are, taken together, the full expression of humanity. If not so joined, they are two, each being as it were a divided person or half a person. Since that impulse to be joined lies deeply hidden in every part of both male and female, and every part has the ability and desire to be joined into one, it follows that people retain mutual and reciprocal sexual love after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #37 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>37. 4. Especially does a love for the opposite sex remain, and in the case of people coming into heaven, namely, people who become spiritual on earth, conjugial love. A love for the opposite sex remains in a person after death for the reason that a male is then still a male, and a female still a female, and masculinity in the male is masculine in the whole and every part of him, likewise femininity in the female, and there is a capacity for conjunction in every detail - indeed, in every least detail - of the two sexes.<p>Now, because that capacity for conjunction was introduced from creation and is therefore permanently present in the two sexes, it follows that each yearns for and aspires to conjunction with the other.<p>Love regarded in itself is nothing but a desire for and consequent effort to conjunction, and conjugial love is a desire for and effort to conjunction into one. For the human male and the human female were so created that from being two they might become as though one person or one flesh. <sup >1</sup>And when they become one, then taken together they are man in his fullest sense. <sup >2</sup>But without that conjunction they are two, and each is like a person divided or half a person.<p>Now, because that innate capacity for conjunction lies inmostly within every single aspect of the male and in every single aspect of the female, and an ability and desire for conjunction into one is present in every part, it follows that a mutual and reciprocal love for the opposite sex remains in people after death.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_6.htm">Mark 10:6-9</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #37 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>37. 4. Love for the other sex, especially, continues, and so does married love for people who come into heaven. They are the ones who became spiritual on earth. Love for the other sex remains with people after death because then men are still male and women are female, and masculinity in a male is masculinity in all of him and in every part of him. The same goes for femininity in a female. And every particular - in fact every little detail - of them offers conjunction.<p>Now, this disposition to unite has been implanted from creation, so it is always there, and that means that the one yearns and pants to unite with the other. Viewed in its own right, love is nothing other than a desire, and from it an effort, to join together and in the case of married love, to join into one person.<p>After all, people were created male and female this way so that the two of them could become like one person, or one flesh, and when they do become one, taken together they are a complete person. Without this conjunction they are two, and each is like a divided or half person. Now, because this attraction hides deep within each particle of a male and each particle of a female, and because the ability and the drive to join together into one is in each particle, a mutual and reciprocal love for the other sex remains with people after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #37 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>37. IV. THAT ESPECIALLY DOES LOVE OF THE SEX REMAIN, AND WITH THOSE WHO COME INTO HEAVEN, BEING THOSE WHO BECOME SPIRITUAL ON EARTH, CONJUGIAL LOVE. The reason why love of the sex remains with man after death is because the male is then a male, and the female a female; and the masculine in the male is masculine in the whole and in every part of him, likewise the feminine in the female; and the conjunctive is present in their single parts, yea, in their most single. Now because this conjunctive was implanted in them from creation and thence is within them perpetually, it follows that the one desires and yearns for conjunction with the other. Regarded in itself, love is nothing but a desire and thence a striving for conjunction, and conjugial love for conjunction into a one; for the male man and the female man were so created that from two they may become as one man or one flesh; and when they become one, then, taken together, they are man in his fullness. Without this conjunction they are two, and each, as it were, is a divided or half man. Now since the conjunctive is inmostly latent in the single parts of the male, and in the single parts of the female; and since the faculty and desire for conjunction into a one lies within their single parts; it follows that the mutual and reciprocal love of the sex remains with men after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #37 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>37. (iv) In particular, love for the sex remains, and so does marital love with those who enter heaven, namely, those who on earth become spiritual. Love for the sex persists after death, inasmuch as male is male then and female female, and the masculine in the man pervades him, as the feminine does the woman; and throughout either there is what is uniting. As something uniting the two has been implanted from creation and is always present, one desires and hopes for union with the other. Considered in itself, love is nothing else than the desire and the effort after union, and marital love, after conjunction into one life. Male and female have been so created that from two they can become, as it were, one being or one flesh. When they do, they are the human life in its fullness; apart from that union, they are two, and each as it were a human being divided and halved. Inasmuch then as something uniting lies inmostly in the being of male and female, and faculty and desire for conjunction into one are present in them, it follows that mutual and reciprocal love for the sex persists after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #37 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>37. (4) That especially the love of the sex, and with those that come into heaven, who are those that become spiritual on earth, conjugial love remains. The reason why the love of the sex remains with man after death is that a male is then a male and a female is a female; and the masculine in the male is masculine in the whole and in his every part; likewise, the feminine in the female; and in the single, yea, in the very least things pertaining to them there is a disposition to conjunction. Now as this conjunctive disposition was implanted in them by creation, and therefore, perpetually inheres, it follows that the one desires and breathes forth conjunction with the other. Regarded in itself, love is nothing else than a desire and thence an effort towards conjunction; and conjugial love to conjunction into one. For the male man and the female man were so created that from two they may become as one man, or one flesh; and when they become one, then taken together they are a man (Latin: homo) in his fulness; but without this conjunction they are two, and each as it were a divided or half man. Since then this disposition to conjunction is inmostly latent in the least things of the male, and in the least things of the female, and in their least things there inheres the faculty and desire for conjunction into one, it follows that the mutual and reciprocal love of the sex remains with people after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #37 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>37. IV: Quod principaliter Amor sexus, et apud illos qui in Coelum veniunt, qui sunt qui spirituales in terris fiunt, Amor conjugialis. Quod Amor sexus apud hominem maneat post mortem, est quia tunc masculus est masculus et foemina est foemina, ac masculinum in masculo est masculinum in toto et in omni parte ejus, similiter foemininum in foemina, ac conjunctivum est in singulis, imo in singularissimis illorum; nunc quia conjunctivum illud a creatione inditum est, et inde perpetuo inest, sequitur, quod unum desideret et spiret conjunctionem cum altero; Amor in se spectatus non est aliud, quam desiderium et inde nisus ad conjunctionem, et amor conjugialis ad conjunctionem in unum; sunt enim homo masculus et homo foemina ita creati, ut ex duobus possint fieri sicut unus homo, seu una caro, et cum fiunt unum, tunc simul sumpti sunt Homo in sua plenitudine; at absque ea conjunctione sunt duo, ac uterque tanquam homo divisus seu dimidiatus. Nunc quia Conjunctivum illud latet intime in singulis masculi et in singulis foeminae, ac facultas et desiderium ad conjunctionem in unum inest singulis, sequitur quod Amor sexus mutuus et reciprocus apud homines maneat post mortem. </p>
