<h4 align="center"></h4><p>456、⑾务必小心谨慎，防止婚姻之爱被无节制的过度淫行所摧毁。摧毁婚姻之爱的无节制的过度淫行，是指不仅削弱婚姻之爱的力量，还夺走它的一切美味的那类淫行。因为在淫行上过度放纵不仅造成疲软和匮乏，还造成不洁和无耻。由于这些东西，婚姻之爱的洁净和贞洁，因而其怒放时的甜蜜和快乐无法被觉察和感受到；更不用说对身体和心灵的伤害，或不仅剥夺婚姻之爱蒙福的快乐，还除去它，将其转为冷淡，因而厌恶的禁止诱惑了。这类淫行就是狂欢作乐，将婚姻的嬉戏变成悲惨的场景。因为无节制的过度淫行就像从最低层开始升起的烈火，焚毁身体、烤干纤维、玷污血液、削弱心智的理性功能；事实上，它们就像一场大火，从地下室窜到屋里，并烧毁整栋房子。父母有责任防止这种事发生，因为青少年在性欲的驱使下还不能凭理性约束自己。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>456、（11）过度的没有限制的放荡行为而造成的婚姻之爱的丧失是指它会耗尽人的精力，会带来不道德的行为，最后使人无法感受到婚姻之爱的纯洁和贞洁。会带来头脑和思想上的伤害。会将婚姻之爱中的快乐变为冷漠。</p><p>过度的放荡行为会象从下面燃起的火一样，将人吞灭。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #456 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>456. (xi) Care must be taken to prevent conjugial love being destroyed by uncontrolled and immoderate indulgence in fornication.<p>By uncontrolled and immoderate indulgence in fornication which is destructive of conjugial love is meant fornication which not only saps the strength, but also does away with all the richness of conjugial love. For unrestrained indulgence in them causes not only weakness and poverty, but also uncleanness and impropriety. These prevent conjugial love being perceived and felt in all its cleanness and chastity, and so in all its sweetness and delightful flowering. Not to mention the damage to body and mind, or the impermissible enticements which not only rob conjugial love of its blessed joys, but even do away with it, turning it to coldness and thus to distaste. Such instances of fornication are orgies, which transform the games of marriage into scenes from tragedy. For uncontrolled and immoderate fornication is like a fire, which starting from the lowest level burns up the body, roasts its fibres, corrupts the blood and infects the rational faculty of the mind. It bursts forth like a fire in the basement which destroys the whole house. It is up to parents to see that this does not happen, because an adolescent boy smitten by lust is not yet rational enough to impose restraint on himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #456 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>456. 11. Care must be exercised to prevent conjugial love from being lost as a result of unrestrained and excessive fornications. By unrestrained and excessive fornications resulting in the loss of conjugial love, we mean instances of fornication which not only debilitate one's energies, but also do away with the refinements of conjugial love. For unbridled license in such matters gives rise not only to infirmities and consequent conditions of indigence, but also to unclean and wanton immoralities, which make it impossible for conjugial love to dwell in its purity and chastity, and so cause it not to be perceived and felt in its sweetness and in the delights of its bloom - to say nothing of the harm and damage done to body and mind, and of forbidden enticements which not only deprive conjugial love of its blessed delights, but also expel it, turning it into coldness and so into loathing.<p>Such cases of fornication are contemptible orgies which turn conjugial sports into tragic scenes. For unrestrained and excessive fornications are like fires which rise up from below and ravage the body, searing the fibers, polluting the blood, and corrupting the rational elements of the mind. Indeed, they burst up like a fire from the basement into the house, totally consuming it.<p>Care must be exercised by parents to prevent this from happening, because an adolescent boy impelled by lust is not yet able in accordance with reason to impose restraint upon himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #456 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>456. 11. Watch out that the love in marriage is not lost due to immoderate and disorderly fornications. The immoderate and disorderly fornications by which the love in marriage is lost means fornications that not only sap your strength but also take all the happiness out of the love in marriage. From free and unrestrained fornications spring not only diseases and resultant weaknesses, but also impurities and immodesties that keep the love in marriage from being noticed and felt in its cleanness and chastity, thus in its sweetness and in the bloom of its delight - not to mention physical and mental injuries, as well as forbidden enticements that not only deprive married love of its happy pleasures but take it away besides and turn it into coldness and thus into loathing.<p>Grecian orgies are that kind of fornications. They twist married play into tragic scenes. For immoderate and disorderly fornications are like fires that rise up from your lowest parts and inflame your body, parch its fibers, foul your blood, and corrupt the rational parts of your mind. For they break out like a fire from the basement into the house and burn it all up.<p>Parents should be careful not to let this happen, because an adolescent boy excited by desire cannot yet put limits on himself by reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #456 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>456. XI. THAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN THAT CONJUGIAL LOVE BE NOT DESTROYED BY IMMODERATE AND INORDINATE FORNICATIONS. By immoderate and inordinate fornications whereby conjugial love is destroyed are meant fornications whereby not only the powers are enervated but all the delicacies of conjugial love are taken away; for from unbridled license in fornications arise not only weaknesses and consequent lack, but also uncleanness and shamelessness. By reason of these, conjugial love cannot be perceived and sensated in its cleanness and chastity and so in its sweetness and the delights of its flower; to say nothing of injuries to body and mind and of the forbidden allurements which not only deprive conjugial love of its blessed delights but also take it away and turn it into cold and thus into loathing. Such fornications are wild revels whereby conjugial sports are turned into tragic scenes; for immoderate and inordinate fornications are like fires which rise up from the ultimates and burn the body, parch the fiber, defile the blood, and vitiate the rational things of the mind; for, like a fire, they burst out from the foundation into the house and consume the whole. It behooves parents to provide against this; for an adolescent youth excited by lust cannot as yet impose restraint upon himself from reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #456 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>456. (xi) Care is to be taken lest marital love be destroyed by immoderate and inordinate fornication. By immoderate and inordinate fornication which destroys marital love, a fornication is meant which not only enervates the powers, but also obliterates all the delicacies of marital love. For from the unbridled license of such fornication there arise not only weaknesses and inability, but uncleannesses and indecencies as a result of which marital love cannot be perceived or felt in its cleanness and chastity and so in none of its sweetness or in the delights of its flower; to say nothing of injuries to body and mind and of forbidden allurements which not only deprive marital love of its blessed delights, but also do away with the love and turn it into cold and loathing. Such fornication is a dissoluteness which makes a tragedy of married joys. Immoderate and inordinate fornications are like flames which, bursting from the extremes, consume the body, parch its fibres, defile the blood and vitiate the reason; they burst like a fire from the foundation into a house, totally consuming it. Parents should take all care to prevent this, for the adolescent boy, inflamed by lust, cannot as yet put a curb on himself from reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #456 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>456. (11) That care ought to be taken lest by immoderate and inordinate fornications conjugial love should be destroyed. By immoderate and inordinate fornications by which conjugial love is destroyed, are meant fornications whereby not only the powers are enervated, but all the dainties of conjugial love are taken away. For from an unbridled indulgence of them arise not only weaknesses and consequent want, but also foulness and immodesties, in consequent of which conjugial love in its cleanness and chastity cannot be perceived and felt, and thus neither in its sweetness nor in the delightfulness of its flower, to say nothing of the injuries to body and mind, and of the forbidden allurements which not only despoil conjugial love of its blessed enjoyments, but even take it away and turn. it into cold and thus into disdain. Such fornications are wild excesses by which conjugial sports are turned into tragical scenes. For immoderate and inordinate fornications are as flaming fires that spring up from the ultimates and consume the body, parch its fibers, defile the blood, and vitiate the rationals of the mind; for they burst forth as a flame from the foundation into a house and burn up the whole. Care ought to be taken by parents that this may not be, because a youth growing up, greatly excited by lust, cannot yet from reason put the curb upon himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #456 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>456. XI. Quod prospiciendum sit, ne amor conjugialis per fornicationes immoderatas et inordinatas perdatur. Per fornicationes immoderatas et inordinatas, a quibus deperditur amor conjugialis, intelliguntur fornicationes, a quibus non modo enervantur <sup>1</sup>vires, sed etiam auferuntur omnes amoris conjugialis lautitiae; ex licentia enim irrefraenata illarum, non modo infirmitates et inde inopiae, sed etiam immunditiae et impudicitiae, oboriuntur, ex quibus amor conjugialis non potest in sua munditie et castitate, et sic nec in sua dulcedine et in sui floris delitiis, percipi et sentiri: ut taceantur damna corporis et mentis, tum inconcessae illecebrae, quae non modo deprivant amorem conjugialem suis beatis jucundis, sed etiam tollunt illum, ac vertunt in frigus, et sic in fastidium: tales fornicationes sunt pergraecationes, per quas ludi conjugiales flectuntur in tragicas scenas: fornicationes enim immoderatae et inordinatae, sunt sicut incendia, quae ex ultimis exsurgunt, et exurunt corpus, torrefaciunt fibras, conspurcant sanguinem, ac vitiant mentis rationalia; erumpunt enim sicut ignis e fundamento in domum, et totam consumit. Ne ita fiat, prospiciendum est a parentibus, quia puer adolescens libidine percitus, nondum ex ratione potest fraenum sibi imponere.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: evervantur </p><p>
