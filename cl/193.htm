<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第193节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>193、⑻女人照《创世记》所描述的那样实实在在地转变为男人的妻子。在这本书中，我们读到，女人是从男人的肋骨被造的，当她被领到那人跟前时，他说：<br><br>这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，可以称她为女人，因为她是从男人身上取出来的。（创世记2:22-24）<br><br>就圣言的灵义而言，胸部的肋骨无非表示属世的真理。熊口齿内所衔的肋骨（但以理书7:5）也是此意，因为熊表示那些在属世意义上阅读圣言，看到其中的真理却不理解的人。男人的胸部表示用来区别于女人胸部的根本和独特品质。这种品质就是智慧（参看187节），因为真理支撑智慧，犹如肋骨支撑胸腔。它们之所以具有这些含义，是因为胸部是属于人的一切事物集中所在的部位。<br><br>由此可知，女人是通过转录男人特有的智慧，也就是出于属世真理的智慧而从男人被造的；对该智慧的爱从男人被转到女人里面，从而变成婚姻之爱。这样做是为了叫男人不要爱自己，而是爱他的妻子。妻子出于其天生的性情，只会将男人所感受的自我之爱转化为对她的爱。而且，我还听说，这一切是通过妻子的爱实现的；只是无论男人还是妻子，都没有意识到这一点。正因如此，只要出于自我之爱恃才自傲，男人就不能以真正的婚姻之爱来爱他的配偶。<br><br>一旦理解了女人从男人被造的奥秘，就能看出，在婚姻中，可以说女人同样从男人被造或形成。这一切由妻子实现，确切地说，由主通过妻子实现，因为正是主将如此行的倾向注入女人。事实上，妻子把男人的形像接收到自己里面是通过将男人的情感变成她自己的（参看173节），以及将男人的内在意愿与她的意愿联结（对此，参看下文），还通过接受男人灵魂的生殖（对此，参看下文）。由此明显可知，女人照《创世记》内在所理解的描述通过诸如她从丈夫及其胸部所取得并植入自己的那类事物而转变为一个妻子。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>193、（8）女人会象创世纪中所说的那样成为男人的妻子。</p><p>在创世纪中说女人是男人的肋骨做成的，当女人来到男人面前时，男人说这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，可以称她为妇人，因为她是从男人身上取出来的（《创世纪》2:22-24）</p><p>在《圣经》中，胸部肋骨的真正含义并非真正意义上的肋骨，而是指真理。这也是《但以理书》7:5中所说的熊嘴里所叨的肋骨的象征意义。熊代表着那些从字面上理解圣经并不理解其中真理的人。人胸部是指使其与女人相区别的重要特性。这种特性就是智慧，参见187节。真理支持着智慧，正象肋骨支撑着胸腔一样，这种重要特性被象征化了。因为胸部是人一切重要器官所在之处，也就是说是人的中心。</p><p>因此说女人是由对男人的智慧的爱转化和复制而来的。因此男人对智慧的爱也被转入女人之中，进而变为婚姻之爱。另外，这样转化的目的是为了将男人对自我的爱，转变为对他的妻子的爱，而妻子天生能将男人对自我的爱转为对妻子的爱。我得知，这也是妻子的爱的结果。男人和女人对此却没有感觉，因此人有隐藏着的对自我的爱，那他也就不能以真正的婚姻之爱去爱他的配偶。</p><p>一旦理解了女人是如何被创造出来的，可以看到在婚姻中女人是从他的丈夫而被创造出来的。这种变化是由主通过女人而实现的，女人有天生的婚姻的倾向。女人会接受融合她丈夫的情感，使丈夫的意愿与自己相结合，并且将丈夫的灵魂接受到自身当中。（这一点参见下述）。</p><p>显然女人变成妻子的内在含义，就是她接收来自于丈夫的特性，并将其融入自身。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #193 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>193. (viii) A woman is really formed into a wife [for her husband] as described in Genesis.<p>In this book it is said that woman was created from man's rib, and that the man said when she was brought to him, 'She is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; and she shall be called Ishshah, because she was taken from Ish (man)' <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_22.htm">Genesis 2:22-24</a>. In the spiritual sense of the Word the rib of the chest means nothing but natural truth. This is the meaning of the ribs which a bear had in its teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>), for bears mean those who read the Word in its natural sense and see the truths in it without understanding them. A man's chest, by which <sup >1</sup>it is distinguished from a woman's chest, means the essential and the self. This is his wisdom (187 above), for truth supports wisdom, just as a rib supports the chest. They have these meanings because the chest is the part in which a person's whole being is centred.</p><p>[2] These facts establish that woman was created out of man by copying his own wisdom, that is, out of natural truth; and that the love of this is transferred from the man to the woman, so as to become conjugial love. This happens to prevent the man being filled with self-love, but rather with the love of his wife. Her innate character cannot fail to convert the self-love a man feels into a love for her. I have been told that this results from the wife's love without either the man or his wife being aware of it. That is why truly conjugial love can never be found in anyone who is moved by self-love to feel pride in his own intelligence.</p><p>[3] Once this mystery of woman being created from man is understood, it can be seen that a woman is likewise, as it were, created or formed from the man in marriage; this is brought about by the wife, or rather by the Lord through the wife, since it is the Lord who imparts to women the inclination to act thus. For a wife takes upon herself an image of the man by making his affections her own (<a href="183.htm">183</a> above), and by linking the man's inner will with hers, on which see below. It also happens by her taking to herself what is propagated by his soul; on which also see below. These remarks make it plain that a woman, according to the description in Genesis understood inwardly, is formed into a wife by what she takes from her husband and from his chest, and copies into herself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #193 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>193. 8. A woman is actually transformed into a wife according to the description in the book of creation. We are told in this book that woman was created from the rib of a man, and that when she was brought to him, the man said,<p>She...is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'Ishshah (Woman) because she was taken from 'Ish (Man). (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_22.htm">Genesis 2:22-24</a>)<p>In the Word, a rib from the breast symbolically means, in its spiritual sense, not a rib but natural truth. This is the symbolism of the ribs which the bear carried between its teeth in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>; for bears symbolize people who read the Word in its natural sense and see truths there without understanding. The breast of a man symbolizes that essential and distinctive quality which makes it different in character from the breast of a woman. This quality is wisdom, as may be seen above in no. <a href="187.htm">187</a>; for truth supports wisdom, as a rib supports the breast. These distinctive qualities are symbolized, because the breast is where all the qualities of a person are, so to speak, at their center.</p><p>[2] It follows from this that woman was created from man by a transmission and replication of his distinctive wisdom, which is formed from natural truth, and that man's love for this wisdom was transferred to woman so as to become conjugial love; moreover, that the purpose of this was to replace love of self in man with love for his wife, who, from a nature innate in her, cannot help but turn the love of self in man to his love for her. I have been told, too, that this comes about as a result of the wife's love, without either the man or the wife being conscious of it. It is because of this that no one is ever able to love his partner with a truly conjugial love so long as he is possessed of a conceit in his own intelligence from a love of self.</p><p>[3] Once this secret of the creation of woman from man has been understood, it can be seen that in marriage a woman is similarly created or formed, so to speak, from her husband, and that this transformation is brought about by the wife - or rather, through the wife by the Lord, who infuses into women the inclination to achieve it. For a wife receives into her an image of her husband by assimilating his affections into her (see above, no. <a href="173.htm">173</a>); by uniting the internal will of her husband with hers (concerning which below); and also by incorporating into her the propagations of his soul (of which also below).<p>It is apparent from this that a woman is transformed into a wife according to the description in the book of creation understood in respect to its inner meaning, and that she is transformed through the qualities she takes from her husband and his "breast" and implants in herself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #193 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>193. 8. A woman really is formed into a wife according to the description in Genesis. In Genesis it says that the woman was created out of the man's rib and that when she was brought to him the man said, "This is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh, and she shall be called 'ishshah, woman, because she was taken from 'ish, man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_23.htm">2:23-24</a>). In the Word the ribs of the chest stand for nothing other than truth on a worldly plane. The ribs that the bear carried in his teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>) stand for this, because bears stand for those who read the Word in its worldly sense, and they see the truth there without understanding it. The chest of a man stands for something essential and particular that is different from what the chest of a woman stands for. This thing is wisdom (see no. <a href="187.htm">187</a> above). For truth supports wisdom just as a rib supports the chest. These things have this meaning because all human things are in the chest as in their center.<p>These observations establish that woman was created from man by the transfer of his own wisdom, which comes from worldly truth. The love for this wisdom was transferred from the man to the woman so it could become married love. And it shows that this was done so there would not be self - love in the man, but love for his wife. She, on account of a natural inborn quality in her, can do nothing but change the self - love in a man into his love for her.<p>And I have heard that this is done by the wife's own love, without the man or wife being conscious of it. This is why no one who has the pride of his own intelligence from self - love can ever love a partner, with a real married love.<p>Once this unknown fact about woman's being created from man is understood, one can see that similarly a woman is, so to speak, created or formed from a man in marriage, and that this is done by the wife, or rather through the wife by the Lord, who pours into women the inclinations to do this. For the wife receives into herself the image of the man through taking his affections to herself<p>(see no. 183 above) and through joining the man's inner will with hers. More about this follows. She also does this by taking the output of his soul into herself. More about this follows, too.<p>These things make it clear that a woman is formed into a wife according to the inner meaning of the description in Genesisby the things she receives from her husband and from his breast, and transfers to herself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #193 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>193. VIII. THAT THE WOMAN IS FORMED INTO [THE MAN'S] WIFE ACTUALLY ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION IN THE BOOK OF CREATION. It is said in that Book, that the woman was created out of the rib of the man, and that when she was brought to him, the man said, This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; and she shall be called Ishah (woman), because she was taken out of Ish (man). <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_22.htm">Genesis 2:22, 23</a>.<p>In the Word in its spiritual sense, by a rib of the breast nothing else is signified than natural truth. This is signified by the ribs which the bear carried between his teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>), by bears, being signified those who read the Word in its natural sense and see truths therein without understanding. By the breast of a man is signified that essential and characteristic thing which is distinct from the breast of a woman. This is wisdom, as may be seen above (no. <a href="187.htm">187</a>); for truth supports wisdom as a rib supports the breast. These are the significations because the breast is the region in which everything belonging to the man is present as in its center.</p><p>[2] From the above it is evident, that woman was created out of man by the transcription of his proprial wisdom, which is wisdom from natural truth; and that the love of this wisdom was transferred from man into woman that it might become conjugial love; also that this was done, to the end that in the man there may be, not self love but love of his wife, and she from her innate disposition cannot do otherwise than convert the self love with the man into his love to her. Moreover, I have heard that this is effected by the wife's love, neither the man nor the wife being conscious of it. Hence it is that no man can ever truly love his partner conjugially if he is in the pride of self- intelligence from love of self.</p><p>[3] When this arcanum of the creation of woman out of man is understood, it can be seen that in marriage woman is likewise created, as it were, that is, is formed from man; and that this is effected by the wife, or rather through the wife, by the Lord, it being the Lord who infuses into women the inclination so to act; for the wife receives the man's image into herself by appropriating to herself his affections (see above, no. <a href="183.htm">183</a>); also by conjoining the man's internal will to her own will, of which hereafter; and, moreover, by appropriating to herself the propagations of his soul, of which likewise hereafter. From this it is evident, that in accordance with the description in the Book of Creation interiorly understood, a woman is formed into a wife by means of such things as she takes from her husband and from his breast and inscribes on herself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #193 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>193. (viii) The woman is actually formed into the man's wife according to the description in the Book of Creation. It is said in this Book that woman was created from man's rib, and that the man, when she was brought to him, said, "This is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; and she shall be called woman because she was taken from man" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_21.htm">Genesis 2:21-23</a>). By a rib of the chest nothing is meant in the Word in the spiritual sense but natural truth. This is also meant by the ribs which the bear bore between his teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>). For by "bears" are signified those who read the Word in the natural sense and see truths there without understanding. By man's breast is signified that peculiarity and essential in which it is distinguished from woman's breast; that this is wisdom, see above (<a href="187.htm">187</a>). Truth sustains wisdom as a rib does the breast. These things are signified because in the breast all things of the human being have, as it were, their center.</p><p>[2] From this it is plain that woman was created from man through the transfer of his peculiar wisdom, which is from natural truth; that is, the love of this was transferred from man into woman, to become marital love. This was done that there might not be love of self in the man, but love of the wife. Inevitably, by native disposition, she converts the love of self with the husband into a love for her; I have heard that this is effected by the wife's love itself, while both man and wife are unaware of it. Hence it is that no one ever loves the partner with true marital love who is in the pride of his own intelligence from self-love.</p><p>[3] When this arcanum of the original creation of woman from man is understood, one can see that in like manner in marriage the woman is as it were created and formed from the man. This is done by the wife, or rather by the Lord through the wife, for He infuses into women the inclination for bringing it about. For the wife receives in herself the man's image through appropriating his affections to herself (see above,<a href="173.htm">173</a>); through conjoining the man's internal will with hers, of which in what follows; and also through making over to herself the propagations of his soul, of which also in what follows. Hence it is plain that the woman is formed into a wife according to the description in the Book of Creation interiorly understood, and by such things as she takes from the husband and his bosom, and inscribes on herself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #193 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>193. (8) That the woman is actually formed into a wife, according to the description in the Book of Creation. It is said in this book that the woman was created out of a rib of the man; and that when she was brought to him the man said:<p>This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; and she shall be called Ishah (Woman), because she was taken out of Ish (Man) (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_22.htm">Genesis 2:22-23</a>).<p>By a rib of the breast, in the Word, nothing else is signified in the spiritual sense than natural truth. This is signified by the ribs which the bear carried between his teeth, in Daniel 7:5. For by bears are signified those who, reading the Word in its natural sense, see truths therein without understanding; by the breast of a man is signified that essential and peculiar thing wherein it is distinguished from the breast of a woman. That this is wisdom may be seen above at n. <a href="187.htm">187</a>; for truth supports wisdom as a rib supports the breast. These things are signified because it is the breast wherein all things pertaining to man are as in their center. From these significations it appears that the woman was created out of the man by transcription of his own wisdom, that is wisdom from natural truth; and that the love of this by the man was transferred to the woman that it might become conjugial love; also, that this was done to the end that in the man there may be, not love of himself, but love of his wife, who, from the disposition innate within her, cannot but convert love of himself with the man into his love to her. And I have heard that this is effected by the love itself of the wife, unconsciously to the man, and unconsciously to the wife. It results from this that no man can ever love his married partner with love truly conjugial, who from love of himself is in the pride of his own intelligence. When this secret of the creation of the woman out of the man is understood, it may be seen that in like manner in marriage the woman is as it were created or formed from the man; and that this is effected by the wife, or rather by the Lord through the wife, who infuses into women inclinations for bringing it to pass. For the wife receives into herself the image of the man, by her appropriating to herself his affections (see above, n. <a href="183.htm">183</a>); and by her conjoining the internal will of the man with her own, of which hereafter; and also by her appropriating to herself the offshoots of his soul, of which likewise hereafter. From this it is plain, that the woman is formed into a wife - according to the description in the Book of Creation, interiorly understood - by such things as she takes out of her husband, even out of his bosom, and inscribes upon herself. </p>
