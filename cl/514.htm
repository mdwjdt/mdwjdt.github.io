<h4 align="center"></h4><p>514、死后，这些诱奸者的命运是悲惨的。因为这种诱奸不仅是一种大不敬，而且是一种恶毒行为。在第一个状态，也就是外在状态，他们比很多人都要举止优雅、言谈礼貌。该状态过后，他们被带入其生命的第二个状态，也就是内在状态。在这种状态下，他们的淫欲得以释放，开始它的表演。他们先被带到发誓贞洁的女人面前。与她们在一起时，其恶毒的欲望被测试，以确保他们受审判之前被证明有罪。当他们发觉这些女人的贞洁时，他们的骗术就开始上演，耍弄花招。不过，由于这一切没有奏效，他们只好徒然离开她们。<br><br>后来，他们被带到真正纯真的女人面前。当他们试图故伎重演时，被赋予能力的女人们就狠狠惩罚他们。她们在这些人的手、脚和脖子上施加沉重的麻木感，最后使他们感到一种昏厥。就在他们遭受这一切时，这些女人逃离了。此后，一条通往一帮妓女的路向他们打开，这些妓女已学会如何娴熟地伪装纯真。她们首先在同伴中将他们嘲笑一番，最后在得到各种承诺后，允许他们强奸自己。<br><br>这样的场景几次三番之后，第三个时期，就是审判的时期就到来了。然后，他们被定罪，沉了下去，聚集到一个地狱的同类那里，该地狱在北部地区。在那里，从远处看，他们就像黄鼠狼。但他们若深深迷恋欺骗，就会由此被带到骗子的地狱，该地狱在西部地区后面的深处。在这个地狱，从远处看，他们就像各种蛇；他们当中最狡诈的，则像毒蛇。但当我蒙允许观察他们的地狱时，在我看来，他们似乎有一种病态黄，长着一张粉白的脸。他们因纯粹是欲望，故不喜欢说话；即便说话，也是发出各种杂音，并且除了同伴外，没有人明白。他们一坐下或站起来，就突然变得不可见了，而是像幽灵一样在洞穴中飞来飞去。因为这时他们陷入幻想，这幻想看似飞舞。飞舞过后，他们就停下来休息。就在这时，令人惊讶的事发生了，他们竟然不认识彼此。这是因为他们陷入欺骗，而欺骗不相信别人，于是便退回来。他们一感觉到从婚姻之爱发出的任何东西，就逃进地下室躲起来。他们也没有两性情爱，完全丧失性能力。他们被称为地狱妖怪。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>514、这些侵犯者死后的命运是悲惨的，因为他们的行为是罪恶的。</p><p>当他们经历了第一阶段后，即他们的外在阶段，在这一阶段他们表现得温文尔雅。之后他们被驱入第二阶段。</p><p>即处于他们内在这中。此时他们的情欲处于自由状态。此时他们被带到发过誓保持贞节的女人面前。在她们的陪伴下，这些男人受到审视以判断他们是否是罪恶的。这些男人感到这些女人的贞节时，他们开始盘算如何欺骗她们，但是若不能达到目的，他们就会离开。</p><p>接下来，他们被带到真正的纯真的女人那里。当他们又想去骗这些女人时，他们就会受到来自于那些女人的惩罚。他们会仿佛要昏迷过去。此后，女人们将他们扔掉了。</p><p>之后，这些男人被带到一群狡诈的装出纯真样子的妓女中去，这些女人首先取笑他们直到她们得到各种承诺，之后她们准许那些男人的要求。</p><p>这样的情形的反复几次后，第三阶段开始了。此时那些被证实有罪的人会与与他们一样的人一起沉到地狱中去。他们的地狱处于北部，从远处看他们好象是黄鼠狼一样。</p><p>若他们是罪深恶极的，他们就会进入到西部的地狱中。在那里他们在远处看上去好象是蟒蛇一样。</p><p>我获许从近处看他们。他们的脸象白灰一样白。因为他们充满了淫荡，他们并不喜欢讲话，若他们讲话，也只有他身边同类的人才会听到。他们坐下或站着时会消失，就象鬼一样，因为那时他们是处于幻象之中。</p><p>四处漂荡一段时间后，他们停下并吃惊地发现他们不认识任何人。这是因为他们处于极端罪恶之中，这种罪恶不承认别人的存在。</p><p>当这些精灵感受到婚姻之爱时，他们就会逃到洞中藏起来。他们也没有对异性的一点点爱。他们被称为恶魔。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #514 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>514. The fate of these seducers after death is miserable, since this seduction is not only an irreligious but also a wicked act. After passing through the first stage, the outward one, in which they surpass many others in the elegance of their manners and the politeness of their conversation, they are brought into the second stage of their lives, the inward one, and in this lust gains its freedom and begins to seek its sport. First they are taken to women who have taken a vow of chastity. With them their wicked desire is tested, to ensure that they are not judged until proved guilty. When they become aware of these women's chastity, their deceit comes into play and they start their tricks. But since this achieves nothing, they leave them.</p><p>[2] Afterwards they are taken to women of genuine innocence. When they try to deceive them in the same way, the women are given the power to punish them severely. For they induce in their hands and feet, and also in their necks, a numbing heaviness, which ends by making them feel as if they are fainting. After experiencing this they tear themselves away from them. After this they find a way open which takes them to a group of promiscuous women, who have learned cunningly to counterfeit innocence. These women first of all make fun of them, and finally after various promises allow themselves to be raped.</p><p>[3] After a number of such scenes the third stage takes over, that of judgment. Then they are found guilty and sink down, being gathered to those like them in a hell in the northern quarter; there they look from a distance like weasels. But if they had been deeply attached to deceit, they are carried down from this to the hell of the deceitful, which is in the western quarter, deep down at the back. Seen from a distance in this they look like snakes of different kinds, the most deceitful like vipers. But when I was allowed to look into their hell, they seemed to me a sickly yellow with a chalk-white face. Being nothing but desires they do not like talking, and if they do they only mutter and make various murmuring noises, which no one but the companions beside them can understand. But soon, as they sit or stand, they make themselves hard to see, flitting around their cave like ghosts. For at this time they are fantasising, and this gives them the appearance of flying. After their flight they settle again; and then, a strange thing, they do not recognise one another. This is because they are deceitful, and deceit does not believe another, but withdraws itself. When any feeling of conjugial love strikes them, they take refuge in underground rooms and hide away. For they are without any sexual love and are totally impotent. They are called hellish genii. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #514 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>514. The fate of these seducers after death is an unhappy one, since the seduction they practice is not only impious but malignant as well.<p>After they have passed through the first period of time, which is spent in outward appearances, in which they are more elegant in their manners and more sweet-spoken in their conversations than many others, they are impelled into the second period of their life, which is devoted to inner realities, in which their lust is set free and begins its sport. At that point they are then taken first to women who had taken a vow of chastity. In their company they are examined to see how malignant their lust is, in order to prevent their being judged until proven guilty. When the men sense the women's chastity, their guile begins to operate and to work its deceits; but on meeting with no success, they depart from them.</p><p>[2] Next they are introduced to women of genuine innocence. When they attempt to deceive these in the same way, by a power given the women they are severely punished; for the women inflict on their hands and feet a heavy numbness, and on their necks as well, and finally cause to them to feel as though they are about to faint. Then, when the men are thus afflicted, the women tear themselves away from them.<p>After that a path is opened for them to a particular band of harlots who have learned to skillfully feign innocence; and these harlots first make them objects of laughter in their company, until, after receiving various promises, they finally allow themselves to be violated.</p><p>[3] Following several such scenes, a third period ensues which is one of judgment. At that time those who have been proven guilty then sink down and are gathered to their like, in a hell which is situated in the northern zone, where they appear at a distance as weasels.<p>However, if they have been consumed with guile, they are taken from there to a hell of the guileful which is situated deep in the hinder part of the western zone. In that hell they appear at a distance as serpents of various kinds, and the most guileful as vipers.<p>Still, in the hell itself, which I was granted to see into, they looked to me as though sickly pale and chalk-faced. Moreover, because they are filled with nothing but lust, they do not like to speak; and if they speak, they only mutter and mumble various things which are not intelligible to any but their companions next to them. But as soon as they sit or stand they make themselves invisible and flit about in the cavern like ghosts; for they are then in a state of fantasy, and the imagination seems to fly.<p>After flying around they come to rest; and then, surprisingly, they do not recognize one another. The reason for this is that they are engrossed in guile, and guile does acknowledge another's existence and so holds itself aloof.<p>When these spirits sense anything of conjugial love, they flee into underground chambers and hide. They are also without any love for the opposite sex, and are figures of utter impotence. They are called infernal genii. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #514 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>514. What happens to these seducers after death is sad, because the seduction is not just ungodly but malicious as well. They go through an initial period, involved in superficial things, with more elegant manners and more smooth - talking speech than others.<p>Then they are reduced to the second period of their life, which involves their inner qualities. In this period their lust is set at liberty and begins its role. Only then are they led to women who have taken the vow of chastity. Among these women they are tested to see how malicious their desire is, so that they will not be judged without clear proof. When they notice these women's chastity their trickery goes into action, and they ply their skills.<p>But it is useless, so they leave the women.<p>Then they are brought to women of an innocent nature. When they try to deceive these women the same way, the women have a power that heavily penalizes them, for they induce a heavy numbness on their hands and feet, as well as their necks, and finally make them feel that they are passing out. While they are going through this, the women escape from them.<p>After all this a path opens for them to a certain gathering of harlots who have learned how to imitate innocence skillfully. First these harlots joke at them among themselves and then let themselves be seduced, after various promises.<p>After a few scenes like these, the third period sets in - a period of judgment. Then the guilty ones sink down and are gathered to their likes in a hell that is in a northern region. From a distance there they look like weasels. But if they have been preoccupied with deceit, they are taken from here down to the hell of frauds, which is in a western region below and behind. Here they resemble, from a distance, various kinds of snakes, and the most deceitful look like vipers. But within the hell itself, which I had an opportunity to look into, they looked ghastly to me, with chalky faces.<p>They are nothing but selfish desires, so they are not fond of talking, and if they do talk they only mumble and murmur various things that no one understands but the companions next to them.<p>But as soon as they sit or stand they make themselves invisible and fly around the cavern like ghosts, for then they are in fantasies, and fantasy seems to fly. After flying they alight, and then, surprisingly, they do not recognize one another. The reason for this is that they are preoccupied with trickery, and trickery does not believe anyone else and sneaks away.<p>When these people detect anything having to do with married love they escape into caves and hide. They have no love of the other sex and are impotency itself. They are called spirits of hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #514 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>514. The lot of these seducers after death is sad, for this seduction is not only impiety but also malignity. After passing through the first period of their life, which is spent in externals, and during which they excel many others in elegant manners and smooth speech, they are brought into the second period which is spent in internals and in which their lust is set free and commences its play. They are then first brought to women who have taken the vow of chastity. While with these, they are explored as to the nature of their malignant concupiscence, and this because they must not be judged unless convicted. When they sensate the chastity of these women, their deceit commences to act and to practice its wiles, but being in vain they leave them.</p><p>[2] Afterwards they are introduced to women of genuine innocence. When they attempt in the same way to beguile these, then, as a result of a power given these women, they are grievously punished; for they bring on their hands and feet, and likewise on their neck, the heaviness of numbness, and finally cause them to feel a kind of swoon, and while they are thus suffering, the women escape. After this a way opens for them to a band of harlots who have learned skillfully to counterfeit innocence. Among themselves, these harlots first expose them to ridicule, and then, after various pledges, suffer themselves to be violated.</p><p>[3] After several scenes of this kind, then comes the third period which is that of judgment. Then, being convicted, they sink down and are gathered to their like in a hell which is in the northern quarter. There they appear from afar off like weasels. But if they had been consumed with deceit they are taken from this hell to the hell of the deceitful which is deep down in the western quarter at the back. In this hell they appear from afar like serpents of various kinds, and the most deceitful of them like vipers; but in the hell itself, into which it was given me to look, they were seen by me as ghastly with a chalky face. Being merely concupiscences, they do not like to speak, and if they do speak, they merely mutter and murmur various things which are understood by none but the companions at their sides. As they are sitting or standing, they suddenly make themselves invisible and fly around in the cavern like specters; for they are then in fantasy, and fantasy appears to fly. After flying, they rest, and then, what is surprising, they do not know one another. This is due to the fact that they are in deceit, and deceit does not believe another and so withdraws itself. When they sensate anything proceeding from conjugial love, they flee into crypts and hide themselves. They are also without love of the sex, and are absolute impotences. They are called infernal genii. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #514 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>514. The lot of these seducers after death is sad, for such seduction is not only impiety but malignity, too. After they have passed the first period, which is in externals, in which they are more elegant of manner and smooth of speech than many others, they are driven into the second period of their life, which is in internals, in which lust is freed and begins its sport. They are taken first to women who have vowed chastity. At their hands they are examined to see how malignant their concupiscence is, to the end that they may not be condemned unless convicted. When they feel the chastity of these women, their deceit begins to act and to exert its arts; but as it is in vain, they leave them.</p><p>[2] They are then introduced to women of real innocence. When they try similarly to deceive these, they are heavily punished through a power given the women. For these induce an oppressive numbness on hands and feet, and on the neck, too, and finally make the men feel a swoon. While the men suffer these things, the women escape. Upon this a way is opened to the seducers to a certain company of harlots who have learned to counterfeit innocence skillfully. At first the harlots hold them up to laughter among themselves, but finally suffer themselves after various stipulations to be violated.</p><p>[3] After some such scenes a third period follows, which is one of judgment; and then, being convicted, they sink down and are gathered to their like in a hell which is in the northern quarter, where at a distance they look like weasels. If they had been controlled by deceit, they are taken from this hell to the hell of the deceitful, deep down at the back in the western quarter. In this hell they look at a distance like snakes of various sorts, and the most deceitful among them like vipers. But in the hell itself, into which I was allowed to look, they appeared to me ghastly, with faces of chalk. Being sheer concupiscences, they do not like to speak, and if they do speak, they mumble and mutter things intelligible only to the companions at their side. When they sit down or stand, they render themselves invisible and fly about the cavern like specters; for they are in phantasy then, and phantasy has the look of flying. After flying about, they come to rest, and strange to say, do not know one another then. This is because they are in deceit; deceit does not credit another, but holds itself aloof. At the slightest breath of marital love, they flee into caves and hide. They have no sexual love and are veritable impotences. They are called infernal genii. </p>

In this hell they appear from afar like serpents of various kinds, and the most deceitful like vipers. But in the hell itself, into which it was given me to look, they appeared lurid, with a chalky face. And as they are mere concupiscences they do not like to speak, and if they speak they only mutter and mumble various things, which are understood by none but the companions at their side. But presently, as they sit or stand, they make themselves inconspicuous; and they flit about in the cavern like specters; for they are then in phantasy and a phantom appears to fly. After the flight they rest, and then, which is surprising, they do not know one another. This is due to the fact that they are in deceit, and deceit does not believe another, and so withdraws itself. When they perceive anything of conjugial love they flee into crypts and hide themselves. They also are without the love of the sex, and are very impotences. They are called infernal genii. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #514 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>514. Sors horum seductorum post mortem est tristis, quoniam seductio illa non modo est impietas sed etiam malignitas: illi, postquam primam periodum transigerant, quae est in externis, in quibus prae multis aliis elegantes moribus et suaviloquentes sermonibus sunt, rediguntur in alteram periodum vitae suae, quae est in internis, in quibus libido manumittitur, et inchoat suum ludum; et tunc primum feruntur ad foeminas, quae castitatem voverant; apud has explorantur qualis maligna illorum concupiscentia est, propter causam ne judicentur nisi convicti; cum illarum castitatem sentiunt, dolus illorum incipit agere, ac moliri suos astus, sed quia incassum, ab illis abeunt.</p><p>[2] Postea introducuntur ad foeminas genuinae innocentiae; has cum similiter decipere conantur, ex data foeminis illis potentia, graviter mulctantur, inferunt enim manibus et pedibus illorum gravedinem stuporis, pariter cervicibus illorum, et demum faciunt illos sentire sicut deliquium; quae dum passi sunt, se ab illis eripiunt. Post haec aperitur illis via ad quandam catervam meretricum, quae callide mentiri innocentiam didicerant; <sup>1</sup>et hae primum exponunt illos risui inter se, et demum post varias sponsiones patiuntur se violari.</p><p>[3] Post tales aliquot scenas supervenit Tertia periodus, quae est judicii; et tunc convicti subsidunt, et colliguntur ad similes in Inferno, quod est in Plaga septentrionali, et ibi apparent e longinquo sicut mustelae: sed si dolo inescati fuerint, ab hoc deferuntur ad Infernum dolosorum, quod est in Plaga occidentali profunde a tergo; In hoc e longinquo apparent sicut serpentes varii generis, et dolossimi sicut viperae: at in ipso Inferno, in quod datum est inspicere, visi mihi sunt sicut luridi, facie calcaria; et quia sunt merae Concupiscentiae, non amant loqui, et si loquuntur, solum mutiunt et murmurant varia, quae non ab aliis quam a consociis a latere intelliguntur; sed mox ut sedent aut stant, faciunt se inconspicuos, <sup>2</sup>et in caverna circumvolitant sicut larvae, tunc enim in phantasia sunt, et phantasia apparet volare: post volatum se reponunt; et tunc, quod mirum est, non cognoscit unus alterum; hoc inde est, quia in dolo sunt, ac dolus non credit alteri, et sic subtrahit se.
