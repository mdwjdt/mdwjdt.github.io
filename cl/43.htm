<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第43节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>43、此后，来自那天堂的一个天使出现在我面前，手里拿着一张羊皮纸，他将羊皮纸展开，说：“我发觉你正默想婚姻之爱。这张羊皮纸上有关于它的智慧奥秘，然而在世上还不为人所知。如今，它们被披露出来，因为这极其重要。我们天堂所拥有的这类奥秘，远超过其它天堂的，因为我们就生活在爱与智慧的婚姻中。不过，我预言，除了被主接入新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷的人外，没人会将这爱归给自己。”说着，天使将这张展开的羊皮纸抛下来。一个天使灵将它拾起来，放到一个房间的桌子上，并立刻将这房间锁上了。他递给我钥匙，说：“写吧。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>43、此后，来自于那个天堂的一个天使出现在我面前。他展开手中握的纸，说道“我看见你在思考婚姻之爱。这张纸上写有世间未知的秘密。现在必须将它展示给世上的人，因为这很重要。在我们这个天国中的这样的秘密比其它的天国多，原因是我们生活在婚姻之爱及智慧之中。但是我可以这样推测——只有被主接受到新教会耶新郎路沙冷教会中的人，才会得到那种爱。”</p><p>说着，天使把那张纸递下来，一个精灵接过来并将它锁在一个特殊的屋子中。然后，他把钥匙递给我说道：“写下来。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #43 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>43. After this I saw an angel from that heaven. He held in his hand a parchment, which he unrolled with the words, 'I have seen that you are meditating about conjugial love. This parchment contains treasures of wisdom on that subject, which have not yet been revealed in the world. They must now be revealed, because this is important. We have in our heaven more of these treasures than elsewhere, because we enjoy the marriage of love and wisdom. But I prophesy that the only people who will make that love their own are those whom the Lord receives into the new Church, which is the New Jerusalem.' With these words the angel let go of the unrolled parchment, which a certain angelic spirit took and placed on a table in a room; this he at once locked up and handed me the key, with the instruction, 'Write about it.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #43 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>43. After this, an angel from that heaven appeared to me, holding in his hand a sheet of paper, which he unrolled, saying, "I saw that you were meditating on conjugial love. This sheet of paper contains secrets of wisdom hitherto undiscovered in the world. They are disclosed now, because it is important. In our heaven there are more of these secrets than in the rest of the heavens, because we live in a marriage of love and wisdom. But I predict that none will make that love their own except those who are received by the Lord into the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem."<p>Saying this, the angel sent the unrolled sheet of paper down, and one angelic spirit took it and placed it on a table in a particular room, which he immediately locked. And handing me the key he said, "Write." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #43 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>43. After this I saw an angel from that heaven, holding a parchment in his hand, which he unrolled, saying, "I saw you meditating about married love. On this parchment is unknown lore about married love - things not discovered in the world until now. Now they are disclosed, because it is important. In our heaven there are more of these secrets than in the others because wisdom and married love are within us. But I predict that only those whom the Lord receives into the New Church which is the New Jerusalem will make that love a part of themselves."<p>After these words the angel dropped the unrolled parchment down. Then an angelic spirit caught it and laid it on a table in a certain room, which he closed at once, handing me the key, and saying, "Write." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #43 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>43. After this, an angel of that heaven appeared to me, holding in his hand a parchment which he unrolled, saying: "I saw that you were meditating on conjugial love. In this parchment are arcana of wisdom concerning it, not as yet made known in the world. They are now disclosed because it is a matter of importance. In our heaven there are more such arcana than in other heavens because we are in the marriage of love and wisdom. But I predict that none will appropriate that love to themselves save those who are received by the Lord into the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem."<p>Saying this, the angel let down the unrolled parchment; and an angelic spirit took it up and laid it on a table in a room which he immediately shut up. Then, handing me the key, he said, "Write." </p>

In this parchment are arcana of wisdom on the subject not hitherto made known in the world. They are now disclosed, because it is important that they should be. More of these arcana are to be found in our heaven than in others, because we are in the marriage of love and wisdom. But I predict that only those will possess themselves of this love who are received by the Lord into the new Church, which is the New Jerusalem."<p>So saying the angel let down the unrolled parchment. An angelic spirit <sup >1</sup>intercepted it and laid it on a table in a certain room which he immediately locked.

<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #43 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>43. Post haec visus est mihi Angelus ex Coelo illo, tenens in manu membranam, quam evolvebat, dicens, "vidi quod mediteris de Amore conjugiali; in hac Membrana sunt de illo arcana sapientiae, non adhuc detecta in Mundo; detegentur nunc, quia interest; sunt in nostro Coelo illa arcana plus quam in reliquis, quia nos in conjugio Amoris et Sapientiae sumus: sed praedico, quod non alii Amorem illum sibi appropriaturi sint, quam qui in Novam Ecclesiam, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, a Domino recipiuntur." His dictis, demisit Angelus Membranam evolutam, quam quidam Spiritus Angelicus excepit, et reposuit super Mensa in quodam Conclavi, quod illico conclusit, et porrexit mihi clavem, et dixit, "scribe." </p>
