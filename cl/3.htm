<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第3节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>3、商讨过后，北方第一组说：“天上喜乐和永恒幸福其实与天上的生活是一样的。所以”，他们说：“凡进入天堂者，就得享构成天上生活的喜庆，犹如参加婚礼的人得享那里的喜庆。天堂不就在我们眼前的头顶上，因而在某个地方吗？唯有那个地方才有幸福之上的幸福，极乐之上的极乐。鉴于那地方充满喜乐，无论是谁，只要进入天堂，就会沉浸其中，直到这幸福极乐充满他的全身心。因此，天上的幸福，也就是永恒的幸福，无非是被许可进入天堂，而这种许可全凭神的恩典。”<br><br>说完这番话，北方第二组凭他们的智慧提出了这样的猜想：“天上喜乐和永恒幸福无非就是有天使快乐相伴，和他们愉快交谈。这会使他们常常面带微笑，并因动听的话语和诙谐的言语而笑口常开。天堂的喜乐不就是这类话题的交替变化，直到永远吗？”<br><br>第三组，就是由西方的智者组成的第一支队伍，出于其情感的思维表达了这样的观点：“天上喜乐和永恒幸福不就是与亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各一同坐席吗？席上摆满山珍海味，美酒佳酿。欢宴过后，少男少女随着管弦音乐翩翩起舞，还不时响起甜美的歌声。最后，夜幕降临的时候则有戏剧表演；此后又是一个盛宴，天天如此，直到永远。”<br><br>此番陈述过后，第四组，就是来自西方的第二支队伍，发表自己的看法，他们说：“关于天上的喜乐和永恒的幸福，我们持有许多观念，也研究了各种喜乐，并进行了比较，得出的结论是：天上的喜乐就是伊甸园的喜乐。天堂不就是伊甸园吗？它从东延到西，从南延到北，里面有各种果树和美丽的鲜花。园子当中是壮丽的生命树，蒙福的人都围着它坐下，吃着美味的水果，装饰最芳香的花环。我们还得出这个结论：由于恒春的气候，这些花果日日生长，品种繁多。由于它们的不断生长和盛开，以及恒春的气候，头脑和心灵必天天呼吸新的喜乐，从而恢复活力，以至于回到青春年华，由此进入亚当和他妻子被造时所享受的远古状态。他们就这样重回他们的伊甸园，现在这伊甸园从地上挪到了天上。”<br><br>第五组，就是由南方的聪明人组成的第一支队伍，作了如下陈述：“天上的喜乐和永恒的幸福只不过是无上的权力和无尽的财富，它们会赋予连帝王也无法企及的富丽堂皇和无与伦比的辉煌。我们认为，这些必是天上的喜乐与恒久享受，也就是永恒的幸福；只要想想世上达到这种状态的人就知道了。此外，我们从以下事实推断出：幸福就是与主同在天堂掌权，作君王和首领，因为他们是主的儿子，而主是万主之主，万王之王。他们要坐在宝座上，并有天使伺候。我们从以下事实来理解天堂的辉煌：用来描述天上荣耀的新耶路撒冷，每门都是一颗珍珠，街道是纯金的，墙的根基是宝石的。所以，凡被接入天堂的人，都会有自己金碧辉煌、珠光宝气的宫殿，权力也会依次交接。因为我们知道，喜乐是这类事物所固有的，幸福天生就在它们里面；并且神的应许从不落空，所以我们不得不断定，天上最幸福的生活状态唯源于此。”<br><br>此后第六组，就是南方的第二支队伍，抬高嗓门说：“天上的喜乐和永恒幸福无非是永远赞美神，一个持续到永远的宗教庆典，一个伴随歌声和胜利欢呼声的最蒙福的敬拜行为。我们的心就这样不断被提升到神那里，完全相信我们的祷告和赞美会由于神赐福我们的慷慨而蒙悦纳。”一些同伴补充说，对神的这种赞美还伴有华丽的灯台，最馨香的焚香，盛大的队列。祭司长拿着大号在前面带路，后面跟着主教和大大小小的牧师，最后是手拿棕榈叶的男人和手拿金像的女人。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>3、（1）商讨之后，第一组，他们来自北方，他们说天国之乐和永恒的幸福与天国中的生活没有区别。“因此”他们说：“进入天堂的每一个人都进入到它的快乐之中，就像参加婚礼的人溶入到婚礼的喜庆之中一样。难道天堂不是一个我们能看到并且有确定位置的地方吗”除了那里，没有别的地方存在幸福中的幸福，快乐中的快乐。至于在那里的快乐的程度，人们在被带入天国时，根据他们的理解程度及各种感觉而被带入它的幸福和快乐之中。因而，天国之乐，也就是永恒的幸福，也就是被带入天堂，被神的恩惠所接纳。”</p><p>（2）接着他们的阐述，来自北方的第二组根据他们的智慧做出这种推断：“天国之乐及永恒的幸福无非就是与天使相联，与他们愉悦地交流，并通过这种融洽和交流而笑口常开。天国之乐是什么？无非就是这种快乐永久的交流。”</p><p>（3）第三组，也就是来自西方的智者根据他们成员的理解阐述了他们对此的观点：“天堂之乐及永恒的快乐是什么？无非就是与出席丰盛的宴席, 接下来是年青人伴着音乐翩翩起舞，并不时地融入甜美的歌声？最后在晚上有剧目上演，之后是更多的宴席。这样日复一日直到永远。”</p><p>（4）在此陈述之后，来自西方的第二组汇报了他们的见解：“我们对天国之乐及永恒的幸福有许多观点，通过比较我们得出结论。天国之乐就是像伊甸园中的快乐一样。天堂会是什么，它是伊甸园。从东到西，从南到北，有果树和美丽的花儿，在它之中是巨大的生命树，在它周围坐着得到祝福的人，吃着美味的水果，戴着甜美的花朵？</p><p>“我们还得出结论，基于恒久的春天的气候，花和果实连绵不断，种类繁多；因为花果不断地和长，加上恒久的春天，人的身心不禁每天都在感受快乐，永远地返回到他们年轻的状态中，并因此进入到亚当及他的妻子最初被创造出来那种纯真之中。进而，他们返回到乐园，从世间进入了天国。”</p><p>（5）第五组，也就是来自南方的智者的第一组做出了以下陈述：“天国之乐及永恒的幸福就是无限的权力，积聚大量财富，进而有帝王般的豪华和无限的壮丽。我们认为天国之乐和永恒的幸福存在于这些事物中是基于我们对世间拥有这些事物的人的观察。另外，我们认为，天国的快乐将会与主同在，将会是王和王子，因为它们是主的儿子。它们会处于权力之中，天使会服务于它们。“至于天国的宏大，我们同意新耶路撒冷的说法，它对天国进行了描述。天堂有许多门，每个门都是一颗珍珠，街上是纯金，墙建在宝石之上。基于此，我们推断，每个进入天堂的人都有自己纯金的宫殿，闪耀着光芒。权力会依次轮流。因为我们知道快乐和幸福与财富权力本质相连，神的承诺是不会变的，我们无法从其它地方找到天国生活的快乐。”</p><p>（6）之后，第六组，即来自南部的第二组说道：“天国之乐及永恒的幸福就是要不断地荣耀主，就是永恒的宗教仪式，就是欢乐的崇拜仪式，将心灵不断地向主靠近，对主接受我们的祷告及我们对主无限恩典的赞美充满信心。”</p><p>这一组中的一些人说，仪式中要有瑰丽的灯光和甜美的薰香。要有最高的牧师带领下的队列，在其它神职人员相随，之后跟随着手里拿着棕榈叶的男人和拿着金色的雕像的女人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #3 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>3. After discussion the first group, which was from the north, said that heavenly joy and everlasting happiness are really one with life in heaven. 'Everyone therefore,' they said, 'who comes into heaven, comes to enjoy the festivities which make up life there, just as anyone going to a wedding enjoys the festivities there. Heaven is within our sight above us, isn't it, and so in a place? There and nowhere else is bliss on top of bliss, pleasures on top of pleasures. Anyone on coming into heaven is plunged into these, to the utmost of his mental perception and to the utmost of his bodily sensation, because the joys of that place are so intense. So heavenly happiness, which is also everlasting, is nothing more than being admitted to heaven; admission is by God's grace.'</p><p>[2] After this speech, the second group from the north out of their wisdom made the following prediction: 'Heavenly joy and everlasting happiness are simply the most entertaining meetings with angels, and the most charming conversations with them. This keeps their faces constantly wreathed in smiles, and the mouths of the whole assembly laughing sweetly at their soft words and witty speech. What are the joys of heaven but variations on this theme for ever?'</p><p>[3] The third group, the first of the wise from the western quarter, from thinking about their affections made this declaration: 'What are heavenly joy and everlasting happiness but feasting with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? Their tables will be supplied with rich and dainty dishes, fine wines and noble vintages; and after the banquet there will be games and dances by girls and youths to the music of bands and pipes, with interludes of the sweetest singing of songs. Then finally toward evening there will be theatrical performances, and after this another banquet, and so on every day for ever.'</p><p>[4] Following this statement the fourth group, the second from the west, pronounced its opinion. 'We have held,' they said, 'numerous ideas about heavenly joy and everlasting happiness, and we have looked into various joys and compared one with another; and we have come to the conclusion that the joys of heaven are the joys of a garden. What is heaven but a garden stretching from east to west and from south to north, containing fruit trees and delightful flowers? In the middle will be the magnificent tree of life, around which the blessed will sit, feeding on fruits of exquisite flavour, and decked with garlands of flowers with the sweetest scent. Under the breezes of a perpetual spring these will grow time and again in infinite variety day by day. Their perpetual growth and flowering, as well as the constant spring climate, will continually refresh the mind, so that they cannot fail to take in and imbibe new joys day by day, and bring people back to the flower of youth and so to the primeval state, which Adam and his wife were created to enjoy. Thus they will be returned to their garden of Eden, now transferred from earth to heaven.'</p><p>[5] The fifth group, which was the first of clever people from the south, made the following statement: 'Heavenly joys and everlasting happiness are simply surpassing dominions and the richest treasures, which will confer magnificence beyond the reach of kings, and splendour beyond compare. We have grasped that these must be the joys of heaven and their continued enjoyment, which is everlasting happiness, by considering those in the previous world who attained this state. Moreover, we infer this from the fact that the happy are to reign in heaven with the Lord, and be kings and princes, because they are the sons of Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords; and they will sit on thrones being waited on by angels. We have grasped the magnificence of heaven from the fact that the New Jerusalem, which is used to describe the glories of heaven, will have each of its gates made out of a single pearl, streets of pure gold, and precious stones for the foundations of its wall. So everyone who is received into heaven will have his mansion gleaming with gold and precious substances, and the rule will pass in turn from one to another. Knowing as we do that in such things joys are inherent and happiness is immanent, and that God's promises can never be broken, we have been forced to conclude that the happiest state of life in heaven is from this source and no other.'</p><p>[6] After this the sixth group, which was the second from the south, spoke up and said: 'The joy of heaven and its everlasting happiness are simply a perpetual glorifying of God, one long festival lasting for ever, and a most blessed act of worship with songs and shouts of triumph. Thus our hearts will be constantly lifted up to God in full confidence that our prayers and praises will be acceptable on account of God's generosity in blessing us.' Some of the group added that this glorifying of God will be accompanied by magnificent lamps, the most fragrant incense and processions of great pomp, with the chief priest leading the way with a great horn, followed by the bishops and dignitaries of higher and lower rank, and finally by the men with palms and the women with images made of gold in their hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #3 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>3. After conferring, the first company, which came from the north, said that heavenly joy and eternal happiness are the same as the life of heaven. "Consequently," they said, "everyone who enters heaven enters with his life into its festivities, just as one who enters into a wedding celebration enters into its festivities. Is not heaven something we can see above us, thus something that has location? <sup >1</sup>There and nowhere else exists bliss upon bliss and pleasure upon pleasure. On account of the fullness of joys in that place, a person is introduced into this bliss and pleasure with every perception of his mind and every sensation of his body when he is introduced into heaven. Therefore heavenly happiness, which is also eternal happiness, is simply admission into heaven, and admission by Divine grace."</p><p>[2] Following that statement, the second company from the north presented in accordance with its wisdom this conjecture: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness consist simply in delightful associations with angels and enjoyable conversations with them, which keep the countenance in continual expressions of gladness and the mouths of all in pleasant laughter as a result of charming and witty exchanges. What are heavenly joys but varying interchanges of this sort to eternity?"</p><p>[3] The third company, which was the first of the wise from the western zone, expressed in accordance with the thoughts of its members' affections this opinion: "What else is heavenly joy and eternal happiness but dining with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <sup >2</sup>at tables that will be set with rich delicacies and fine vintage wines, followed by exhibitions and dances by young men and women performed to the rhythms of stringed and wind instruments, and from time to time the sweet singing of songs? And finally in the evening there will be theatrical performances, and after that more dining. And so on every day to eternity."</p><p>[4] After that pronouncement, the fourth company, the second from the western zone, reported its verdict, saying, "We have entertained many ideas with respect to heavenly joy and eternal happiness, but having considered various kinds of joy and compared them with each other, we have come to the conclusion that heavenly joys are like those of a paradise. What else is heaven but a paradise, <sup >3</sup>stretching from east to west and from the south to the north, containing fruit trees and delightful flowers, and in their midst the magnificent tree of life, around which the blessed will sit, feeding on fruits of exquisite flavor <sup >4</sup>and adorned with garlands of sweet-smelling flowers?<p>"We conclude, too, that owing to a climate of endless spring, these fruits and flowers are produced again and again daily, with unlimited variety; and that because of their continual production and growth, and at the same time the constantly springlike temperature, minds and hearts cannot help but breathe in and out new joys every day, being forever rejuvenated so as to return to the flower of their youth and through this to the pristine state into which Adam and his wife were created. Thus they are restored to the paradise of old, transferred from earth to heaven."</p><p>[5] The fifth company, which was the first of the brilliant from the southern zone, declared the following: "Heavenly joys and eternal happiness are nothing else but positions of great power, possessions of great riches, and so superregal magnificence and superglorious splendor. We have discerned that the joys of heaven and the continual enjoyment of them (which is eternal happiness) consist in such things from observing people in the previous world who there possessed them. Furthermore, we know that the happy in heaven will reign with the Lord and will be kings and princes, because they are the sons of Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords. <sup >5</sup>Also that they will sit upon thrones, and that the angels will minister to them. <sup >6</sup><p>"As for the magnificence of heaven, we have discerned this from the account of the New Jerusalem, by which the glory of heaven is described, that it will have gates, each one of which will be one pearl, and streets of pure gold, and a wall founded upon precious stones. <sup >7</sup>From this we conclude that everyone received into heaven has his own palace of gold, resplendent with precious things, and that the right of dominion will pass from one to another in turn. And because we know that joys are intrinsic to such things and happiness inherent in them, and that the promises of God are unbreakable, we have been unable to trace the origin of the most happy state of heavenly life from any other source."</p><p>[6] After this, the sixth company, the second from the southern zone, raised its voice and said, "The joy of heaven and eternal happiness there consist solely in a continual glorifying of God, a religious celebration lasting to eternity, and blessed worship with singing and exultation, resulting in constant elevation of the heart to God, with full confidence in His acceptance of prayers and praises offered in gratitude for His Divine munificence in rendering the worshipers blessed."<p>Some members of the company added that this celebration would be accompanied by magnificent lighting and sweet-smelling incense, with solemn processions led by a high priest carrying a great trumpet, followed by prelates and other clergy, great and small, and behind them men with palm branches and women with golden images in their hands.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-corinthians_12_2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</a>.<p>4.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>5.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/romans_8_14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/romans_8_16.htm">16</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/romans_8_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/galatians_4_4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-timothy_2_12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-john_3_1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-john_3_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_10.htm">5:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_14.htm">17:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_16.htm">19:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>.<p>6.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_29.htm">Luke 22:29-30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_1_13.htm">Hebrews 1:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>7.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #3 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>3. After considering it, the first group - from the north - said, "The joy of heaven and eternal happiness are the same thing as heavenly life, and so everyone who goes to heaven to live enters its festivities - the way someone who goes to a wedding goes to its festivities. Isn't heaven in plain sight up above us, and therefore in a place? That is where blessings upon blessings are, and pleasures upon pleasures, and not somewhere else. A person is swept into these with all mental perception and all bodily sensation, thanks to the overflowing joys of the place, when he is swept up to heaven.<p>So the happiness of heaven, which is eternal, is nothing but getting into heaven - getting in by Divine Grace."<p>After these words, the other group from the north expressed this interpretation: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are nothing but a most delightful companionship with angels and the sweetest conversations with them. This keeps every delighted face wide open forever and every mouth in the crowd laughing with pleasure in the charming talk and wit. What are the joys of heaven but a variety of conversations like that to eternity?"<p>The third group, the first group of wise people from the western quarter, fetched this from the meditations they loved:<p>"What is the joy of heaven and eternal happiness but feasts with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? On their tables will be plenty of delicacies and rich food to eat and lots of fine, noble wine, and after the feasts shows and dances by young women and men moving to rhythmic harmonies and flutes, alternating with the sweetest songs. And then in the evening there will be stage plays with actors. And after all this, feasts again - every day to eternity."<p>After this statement the fourth group - the second from the western quarter - announced their opinion, saying, "We have cherished many ideas about the joy of heaven and eternal happiness, have considered various joys and have compared them, and we conclude that the joys of heaven are the joys of Paradise. What is heaven but a paradise stretching from east to west and south to north? In it are fruit trees and delightful flowers, with the magnificent Tree of Life in the middle, and the blessed sitting around it, enjoying delicately flavored fruits and festooned with wreaths of the sweetest smelling flowers. And the breath of spring is perpetual, so the flowers bloom again and again in endless variety.<p>And their constant growth and blossoming, with the constant spring temperature, keeps these souls continually refreshed, so they cannot help inhaling new joys and breathing them back out every day. It brings them into the flower of youth and thus to the primeval state in which Adam and his wife were created. So they are brought back to their Paradise, transferred from earth to heaven."<p>The fifth group - the first group of intellectuals from the southern quarter - declared this: "The joy of heaven and eternal happiness are nothing but supereminent dominion and richest treasures, which means more - than - regal magnificence and more than - illustrious splendor. From people who had acquired these things in the previous world we can tell that they are the joys of heaven - and the perpetual enjoyment of them, which is eternal happiness. And besides, the blessed in heaven are to reign with the Lord and be kings and princes, because they are sons of the One who is King of kings and Lord of lords, and they will sit upon thrones, and angels will serve them.<p>"We have ascertained the magnificence of heaven from the New Jerusalem, which describes its glory. Each of its gates is a pearl, its streets are pure gold, and the foundations of its wall are precious stones. Consequently, anyone accepted into heaven gets his palace, glittering with gold and costliness, and dominion over one another according to rank. And since we have found out that joys and deep - down happiness are inherent in things like that, and that they are God's unbreakable promise, we cannot trace the very happy condition of heavenly life to anything else."<p>After this the sixth group - the second from the southern quarter - raised their voice and said, "The joy of heaven and its eternal happiness are nothing other than perpetual glorification of God, one eternal religious holiday, and most blessed worship, with songs and jubilation. This means continually lifting one's heart to God with full trust that He accepts one's prayers and praises for the divine bounty of one's blessings."<p>Some of this group added that this festivity would include magnificent lighting and the most fragrant incense, and majestic processions led by a pope with a great big trumpet, greater and lesser bishops and key bearers next, and after them men with palms, and women with golden icons in their hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #3 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>3. After consultation, the FIRST COMPANY, which was from the north, said: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are one with the very life of heaven. Therefore every one who enters heaven, enters, as to life, into its festivities, just as one who goes to a wedding enters into its festivities. Is not heaven above us, before our eyes, and thus in a place? And there and nowhere else is happiness upon happiness and pleasure upon pleasure. When man enters heaven, then, from the fullness of the joys of that place, he is admitted into these as to every perception of his mind and every sensation of his body. Heavenly happiness, therefore, which is also eternal happiness, is nothing else than admission into heaven, and admission by Divine grace."</p><p>[2] After this speech, the SECOND COMPANY from the north, from their wisdom expressed the following opinion: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are nothing else than cheerful companionship with angels, and sweet conversation with them, whereby, from pleasant and witty discourse, the countenance is kept continually expanded with gladness, and the faces of the whole company are wreathed in happy smiles. What are heavenly joys but the variations of such things to eternity?"</p><p>[3] The THIRD COMPANY, which was the first of the wise from the western quarter, speaking from the thoughts of their affections declared: "What else is heavenly joy and eternal happiness but feastings with Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, upon whose tables will be rich and delicate foods, with generous and noble wines; and after the feasts, sports and the dances of maidens and young men, tripping to the measures of tabors and flutes, with the sweet singing of odes interspersed; and then, at evening, dramatic representations, and after these, again feastings, and so on every day to eternity."</p><p>[4] After this utterance, the FOURTH COMPANY, which was the second from the western quarter, announced their opinion, saying: "We have entertained many ideas respecting heavenly joy and eternal happiness, and after exploring various joys and comparing them with each other, have come to the conclusion that heavenly joys are paradisal joys. What else is heaven but a paradise, stretching from east to west and from south to north-- a paradise wherein are fruit trees and delightful flowers, and in the center the magnificent Tree of Life, around which the blessed will sit, eating fruits of delicate flavor, and adorned with wreaths of the most fragrant flowers. And since, by reason of the breathing of perpetual spring, these fruits and flowers are born and reborn daily and with infinite variety; and since, by their perpetual birth and blossom, and by the constant vernal temperature, the mind is continually renewed; the blessed must needs attract and breathe out new joys from day to day, and thus be restored to the flower of their age, and thereby to the primitive state into which Adam and his wife were created, and so be led back into their paradise which has been transferred from earth to heaven."</p><p>[5] The FIFTH COMPANY, which was the first of the men of genius from the southern quarter, said: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are nothing else than supereminent dominion, with boundless wealth, and from this, super-regal magnificence and super-illustrious splendor. That these are the joys of heaven and the continual enjoyment thereof which is eternal happiness, this we have perceived clearly from the case of those who enjoyed them in the former world, and also from the statement that the happy in heaven will reign with the Lord, and, being the sons of Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords, will be kings and princes and will sit upon thrones, with angels ministering to them. We have perceived clearly the magnificence of heaven from the statement that the New Jerusalem, by which is portrayed the glory of heaven, will have gates, each of which will be a single pearl, streets of pure gold, and a wall with foundations of precious stones. Therefore, every one who is received into heaven has his own palace, resplendent with gold and precious things, and a dominion which will pass in turn from one to another. And, knowing that in such things joys are innate and happiness implanted, and that they are God's promises which cannot be broken, we are unable to deduce the happy state of heavenly life from any other source."</p><p> [6] After this, the SIXTH COMPANY, which was the second from the southern quarter, lifted up its voice and said: "The joy of heaven and its eternal happiness are nothing else than the perpetual glorification of God, a solemn festival continuing to eternity, and most blessed worship, with songs and jubilees; and thus a constant uplifting of the heart to God, with full trust in the acceptance of their prayers and praises because of the Divine munificence, and in their own blessedness." Some of the company added that it would be a glorification attended with magnificent illuminations and the most fragrant incense--a glorification with stately processions headed by a pontiff with a great trumpet, who would be followed by primates and key-bearers great and small, and after these, men with palms and women with golden images in their hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #3 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>3. After conference the First Company, which was from the north, said: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are identical with dwelling in heaven. Whoever enters heaven, therefore, enters in his life on its festivities, quite as a guest at a wedding enters into its festivities. Is not heaven above us to the sight and therefore in a place? There, and there only, are bliss upon bliss, pleasures upon pleasures. On entering heaven a man is let into these in every perception of the mind and in every sensation of the body, due to the plenitude of the joys in the place. Heavenly happiness, which is also eternal happiness, is therefore simply admission to heaven, and admission is by Divine grace."</p><p>[2] Thereupon the Second Company from the north out of their wisdom pronounced this surmise: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are nothing but very cheerful intercourse and pleasant talk with angels, by which the countenance is kept expanded in cheer, and all faces wreathed in glad smiles at the pleasantries and witticisms. What are heavenly joys but variations of such pleasures to eternity?"</p><p>[3] The Third Company, which was the first of the wise from the western quarter, spoke from their hearts' thought: "What are heavenly joy and eternal happiness but feastings with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <sup >1</sup>whose tables will be spread with rich and dainty viands and generous and noble wines? After the feasts follow games, and dances of youths and maidens moving to the measures of strings and pipes, with the sweetest songs sung in the intermissions. In the evening there are dramatic representations, then banquets again, and so on, every day to eternity."</p><p>[4] After this deliverance, the Fourth Company - the second from the western quarter - gave their opinion, saying: "We have entertained a number of opinions about heavenly joy and eternal happiness, but after considering different joys and comparing them, we have come to the conclusion that the joys of heaven are the joys of a paradise. What is heaven but a paradise, throughout which from east to west and south to north there are fruit-trees and beautiful flowers and in the midst of all the magnificent tree of life, around which the blessed will be seated, enjoying fruits of delicate flavor, and adorned with wreaths of the most fragrant flowers? Under the breath of perpetual spring, trees and flowers spring up daily and in infinite variety, by their perpetual birth and blooming, together with the constantly vernal temperature, ever renewing the spirits of the blessed, so that they cannot but breathe in and breathe out new joys with every day. They therefore return to the flower of life, to that pristine state, too, in which Adam and his wife were created, and thus are restored to their paradise, transferred now from earth to heaven."</p><p>[5] The Fifth Company, the first of the gifted from the southern quarter, spoke thus: "Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are nothing else than supreme power, limitless wealth, a more than regal magnificence and a more than brilliant splendor. We have seen clearly from those who possessed them in the former world that such things are the joys of heaven and that the perpetual enjoyment of them is eternal happiness. We feel the more sure of this, because the blessed in heaven are to reign with the Lord, <sup >2</sup>and are to be kings and princes, being sons of the King of kings and Lord of lords, and are to sit on thrones, with the angels for ministers. We have also glimpsed heaven's magnificence in that the New Jerusalem, in which the glory of heaven is depicted, is to have gates each of a single pearl, streets of pure gold, and a wall with foundations of precious stones. <sup >3</sup>Every one received into heaven therefore has his own palace, resplendent with gold and precious materials; and enjoys power according to rank, one above another. Knowing that joys and happiness are inborn and inherent in such things, and that they are God's promise which cannot be broken, we are unable to trace the very happy state of heavenly life to any other source."</p><p>[6] Thereupon the Sixth Company, the second from the southern quarter, said with a loud voice: "The joy of heaven and its eternal happiness are nothing else than perpetual glorification of God, solemn festival maintained to eternity, and very blessed worship, with songs and paeans. They consist in constant uplifting of the heart to God, with full trust that He accepts the prayers and praises which in His Divine bounty He endows with such bliss."<p>Some of the company added that this glorification would be attended with magnificent lights and very fragrant incense, with processions of great pomp, too, led by a chief pontiff with a great trumpet, followed by primates and other officials, great and small, and these by men bearing palms and women carrying golden images.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #3 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>3. The first company, which was from the north, after consultation said, 'Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are one with the very life of heaven; and therefore, everyone who enters heaven, as to life enters into its festivities, just as one who goes to a wedding enters into its festivities. Is not heaven above us before our eyes and thus in a place? And there, and only there, are bliss upon bliss and pleasures upon pleasures. Into these a man is admitted when he enters heaven, as to every perception of the mind and every sensation of the body, from the fulness of the joy of that place. Heavenly happiness then, which is also eternal, is nothing else than admission into heaven, and admission by Divine Grace.'<p>When they had said this, the other company from the north, from their wisdom expressed this opinion: 'Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are nothing but most delightful companionship with angels and sweetest converse with them, whereby the countenance is kept continually expanded with joy and the faces of the whole company are wreathed in smiles of gladness, from the courteous discourse and pleasantry. What are heavenly joys but the variations of such pleasures to eternity?'<p>The third company, which was the first of the wise from the western quarter, from the thoughts of their affections, declared: 'What are heavenly joy and eternal happiness but feastings with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, upon whose tables will be rich and delicate viands, with generous and noble wines; and after the feasts, sports and dances of youths and maidens, tripping to the measures of symphonies and flutes, with intervening singing of sweetest songs; and then at evening there will be dramatic representations, and after these feastings again, and so on every day to eternity.'<p>After this utterance the fourth company, which was the second from the western quarter, announced their opinion, saying, 'We have cherished many ideas respecting heavenly joy and eternal happiness, and have considered various joys, and compared them with each other, and have come to the conclusion that heavenly joys are paradisal joys. What else is heaven but a paradise, whose extent is from east to west and from south to north, wherein are fruit trees and delightful flowers, and in the midst of them the magnificent tree of life, about which the blessed will sit, eating fruits of delicate flavor, and adorned with wreaths of flowers of sweetest fragrance? And as these with the breath of perpetual spring come forth and forth again from day to day, with infinite variety, and as by their perpetual birth and blossom, and by the constant vernal temperature, their spirits are continually renewed, they cannot but inspire and breathe out new joys from day to day. And hence they return to the flower of their age, and thereby to the primeval state in which Adam and his wife were created, and thus they are brought again into their paradise translated from earth to heaven.'<p>The fifth company, which was the first of the gifted from the southern quarter, said, 'Heavenly joy and eternal happiness are none other than super-eminent dominion, with boundless wealth, and consequent more than regal magnificence, and more than illustrious splendor. That the joys of heaven and their continual fruition, which is eternal happiness, are these, we have perceived clearly from those who had acquired. them in the former world; and from the fact, moreover, that. the blessed in heaven are to reign with the Lord, and are to be kings and princes, because they are the sons of Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords, and are to sit upon thrones, and the angels will minister unto them. We have gained a conception of the magnificence of heaven from the fact that the New Jerusalem, by which the glory of heaven is portrayed, is to have gates each of one pearl, and streets of pure gold, and a wall with foundations of precious stones; consequently, that everyone received into heaven has his own palace, resplendent with gold and precious things; and dominion in successive rank one above another. And as we know that joys and inborn happiness are inherent in such things, and that they are God's promise which cannot be broken, we are unable to deduce the most happy state of heavenly life from any other source.'<p>After this the sixth company, which was the second from the southern quarter, lifted up their voice and said, 'The joy of heaven and its eternal happiness are none other than the perpetual glorification of God, a solemn festival continuing to eternity, and most blessed worship, with songs and jubilee; and thus a constant uplifting of the heart to God, with full trust in His acceptance of prayers and praises for the Divine bounty of their beatitude.'<p>Some of this company added that this glorification would be attended with magnificent illuminations and most fragrant incense; and with processions of great pomp, a chief pontiff with great sound of the trumpet going before, primates and key-bearers great and small following him, and after them men carrying palms and women with golden images in their hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #3 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>3. Post Consultationem Prima Cohors, quae e Septentrione erat, dixit, quod Gaudium Coeleste, et Felicitas aeterna, sint unum cum ipsa vita Coeli; "quare unusquisque, qui intrat Coelum, quoad vitam intrat in festivitates ejus, non aliter quam qui intrat in nuptias, intrat in harum festivitates; estne Coelum coram visu nostro supra nos, ita in loco, ac ibi et non alibi sunt faustitates supra faustitates, ac voluptates supra voluptates; in has infertur homo quoad omnem perceptionem mentis, et quoad omnem sensationem corporis, ex plenitudine gaudiorum loci istius, cum in Coelum: quare felicitas coelestis, quae etiam est aeterna, non aliud est quam intromissio Coelum, ac intromissio ex Divina Gratia."</p><p>[2] His dictis, Altera Cohors ex Septentrione ex sua sapientia expromsit hoc augurium; "Gaudium Coeleste et Felicitas aeterna non aliud sunt, quam laetissima Consortia cum Angelis, et suavissimae Confabulationes cum illis, ex quibus facies continue expansae tenentur in laetitiis, et ora totius consortii in risibus amaenitatis ex blandiloquiis et facetiis; quid gaudia coelestia quam talium variationes in aeternum."</p><p>[3] Tertia Cohors, quae erat Prima ex sapientibus e Plaga occidentali, ex suarum affectionum cogitationibus edidit hoc: "quid Gaudium Coeleste et Felicitas aeterna aliud, quam Epulationes cum Abrahamo, Isaco, et Jacobo, super quorum Mensis erunt Edulia delicata et opipara, ac Vina generosa et nobilia, et post epulas Ludi ac Choreae virginum et juvenum saltantium ad modos symphoniarum et tibiarum, interjectis cantibus odarum suavissimis; et demum ad vesperam erunt Spectacula ex personatis; et post haec iterum Epulae, et sic quovis die in aeternum."</p><p>[4] His edictis, Quarta Cohors, quae erat Secunda e plaga occidentali, enuntiavit suam sententiam, dicens, "nos fovimus plures ideas de Gaudio Coelesti, et de Felicitate aeterna, et exploravimus varia Gaudia et contulimus illa inter se, et conclusimus quod Gaudia Coelestia sint Gaudia Paradisiaca; quid aliud Coelum quam Paradisus, cujus extensio est ab Oriente in Occidentem, et a Meridie in Septentrionem, et in illo arbores fructuum et flores delitiarum, in quarum medio est magnifica Arbor vitae, circum quam sedebunt beati, vescentes fructibus saporis delicati, ac ornati sertis florum odoris suavissimi; et quod haec aspirante perpetuo vere indies cum infinita varietate enascantur et renascantur; et quod ex horum ortu et flore perpetuo, et simul extemperie jugiter verna, animi continue renovati non possint aliter quam Gaudia indies nova attrahere et respirare, et inde in florentem aetatem, et per hanc in primitivum statum, in quem Adamus et ejus uxor creati sunt, reduci, et sic in Paradisum illorum, e terra translatum in Coelum, remitti."</p><p>[5] Quinta Cohors, quae erat Prima ex ingeniosis e Plaga meridionali, effata est hoc; "Gaudia coelestia et Felicitas aeterna non aliud sunt, quam supereminentia Dominia, et opulentissimae Gazae, et inde super-regia magnificentia ac super-illustris splendor: quod Gaudia Coeli, et horum fruitio continua, quae est aeterna felicitas, illa sint, perspeximus ex illis in Mundo priori, qui potiti sunt illis; et insuper ex eo, quod felices in Coelo regnaturi sint cum Domino, ac futuri reges et principes, quia sunt filii Ipsius, Qui est Rex regum et Dominus dominorum, et quod sessuri sint super thronis, et quod Angeli illis ministraturi sint: magnificentiam Coeli perspeximus ex hoc, quod Nova Hierosolyma, per quam describitur gloria Coeli, habitura sit Portas, quarum unaquaevis erit una Margarita, et Plateas ex puro auro, et Murum fundatum super lapidibus pretiosis; consequenter quod cuivis in Coelum recepto sit sua Aula ex auro et pretiositatibus splendens, ac Dominium ordine ab uno in alterum successurum: et quia novimus, quod talibus innata sint gaudia, ac insita felicitas, et quod sint sponsiones Dei irrefragabiles, non potuimus aliunde statum felicissimum vitae coelestis deducere."</p><p>[6] Post hanc, Sexta Cohors, quae erat Secunda e Plaga meridionali, extulit vocem, et dixit, "Gaudium Coeli et ejus Aeterna felicitas, non aliud est, quam perpetua Glorificatio Dei, Festum perennans in aeternum, ac beatissimus Cultus cum cantibus et jubilis; et sic constans elevatio cordis ad Deum, cum plena fiducia acceptationis precum et laudum propter Divinam munificentiam beatitudinis illorum." Aliqui ex hac Cohorte adjecerunt, quod Glorificatio illa futura sit cum magnificis luminaribus, cumque suffitibus <sup>1</sup>fragrantissimis, et cum processionibus pompae, Pontifice maximo praeeunte cum Buccina magna, sequentibus illum Primatibus et Clavigeris, magnis et parvis, et post hos Viris cum palmis, et Mulieribus cum aureis simulachris in manibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: suffilibus </p>
