<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第二十五章  诱奸纯真者的淫欲</h4><p>513、诱奸纯真者的淫欲既不是奸污处女的淫欲，也不是强奸的淫欲，而是一种独树一帜的淫欲，尤其存在于骗子中间。在他们眼里，纯真的女人是那些视淫乱的邪恶为大罪，因而献身于贞洁、同时献身于虔诚的人。他们对这些女人充满渴望。在天主教国家，她们就是修女。他们认为这些修女比所有人都具有虔诚的纯真，故视她们为满足其淫欲的珍馐美味。为了勾引这类女人，他们首先欺骗，并为此想出一些诡计，然后将其变成自己秉性的一部分，以便能付诸实施，而不会因羞耻退缩，仿佛他们很自然。他们的诡计主要是伪装纯真、爱情、仁爱、贞洁和虔诚。他们利用这些和其它狡猾手段获得童贞女的内在友谊，进而获得她们的爱情。然后，他们通过各种劝诱和暗示，将这爱情从属灵的变成属世的，再后来则通过身体层面的刺激将其变成肉欲。这时，他们就能随心所欲地占有她们了。一旦得手，他们会由衷欢喜，并嘲笑、蔑视他们所侵犯的这些女人。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">侵犯纯真状态的情欲</h4><p>513、这种情欲与诱奸和强奸不同。它存在于罪恶的男人身上。那些视淫乱为罪恶，同时保持贞节和虔诚的女人在这些男人看来是纯真状态的体现。他们渴望这样的女人。在罗马天主教的国家中，这些男人认为那些修女是处于这种纯真状态，他们将这些修女作为侵犯的对象。</p><p>这些罪恶的男人为了去诱骗那些修女或别的女人，装出一种纯真、爱、贞节、虔诚的状态。这样与那些女人成为朋友，并得到她们的爱。并想方设法将与她们的精神性的爱转变为自然的爱，进而转为肉体的爱。得到这些后，他们会在心中感到高兴并嘲笑他们侵犯过的女人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #513 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>513. XXV. THE LUST FOR SEDUCING THE INNOCENT<p>The lust for seducing the innocent is not the same as that for deflowering or for rape, but is a separate and peculiar lust on its own. It is especially to be found among the deceitful. The women whom these regard as innocent are those who look upon the evil of promiscuity as a major sin, so that they are devoted to chastity and at the same time to religion. It is these they lust for. In kingdoms of the Catholic faith there are convents of nuns; and since they believe these to excel all others in piety and innocence, they look upon them as choice delicacies for their lust. In order to seduce women of either of these types they first, being deceitful, think up tricks, and when they have made these a part of their characters, they can put them into effect without being held back by shame, as if they were natural.<p>The tricks are principally the pretence of innocence, love, chastity and religious feeling. They use these and other devices to gain admittance to intimate friendship with these women, and so to their love; and by various means of persuasion and insinuation they turn this from spiritual into natural love, and later by excitement on the level of the body into carnal love. Thus they can possess them at will; once they have achieved this, they are heartily pleased and scorn those they have violated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #513 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>513. THE LUST TO SEDUCE STATES OF INNOCENCE<p>The lust to seduce states of innocence is not the lust to deflower nor the lust to rape, but is a particular and separate lust by itself. It is found especially in guileful men. The women who appear to them as embodiments of innocence are ones who regard the evil of licentiousness as an enormous sin, and who thus devote themselves to chastity and at the same time piety. It is for these women that they burn. In Roman Catholic countries the women are nuns. Because they believe these nuns to be embodiments of innocence beyond all others, they regard them as choice and exquisite objects for their lust.<p>Being men of guile, in order to seduce these women, whether nuns or others, they first devise stratagems, and after they have infused their character with them, without restraint of conscience they put them as though naturally into execution. Their stratagems are principally pretenses of innocence, love, chastity and piety. By these and other deceptions they work their way into the women's interior friendship and so into their love; and by various persuasions and at the same time suggestions they turn this then from a spiritual love into a natural one, and afterwards by incitements into a fleshly, carnal one, and at that point possess them at their pleasure. When they have accomplished this, they rejoice in heart and laugh at the women they have violated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #513 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>513. Chapter 25. Lust for Seducing Innocent Women<p>Lust for seducing innocent women is not a lust for defloration nor a lust for rape but is distinct and unique in its own right. It is found especially in crafty men. Women who seem innocent to them are ones that consider the evil of fornication a great sin so that they are devoted to chastity and piety both at once. Seducers are inflamed for these women. In countries with the Catholic religion they are the virgins in monasteries. Because these men think them the most pious, innocent women of all, they consider them the sweets and delicacies of their lust. They are crafty, so in order to seduce these women or others, they first study out strategies, and after they steep their talents in the strategies they apply them as if it came naturally, without any shame to hold them back. Their strategies are especially pretenses of innocence, love, chastity, and piety.<p>By these arts and other tricks they gain the women's deep friendship and from that their love, and they change it from a spiritual love into a worldly one by persuasion and pretense of various kinds, and then into a physical one with their body, by enticements. And then they have possession of them when they want. After doing all this their hearts are happy, and they joke about the women they have violated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #513 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>513. THE LUST OF SEDUCING INNOCENCES<p>The lust of seducing innocences is neither the lust of defloration nor the lust of violation, but is a lust peculiar to itself and stands alone. It exists especially with the deceitful. The women who appear to them as innocences are those who account the evil of whoredom as an enormous sin and who therefore are zealous for chastity and at the same time for piety. It is towards these that they burn with desire. In countries of the Catholic religion they are nuns. Believing these nuns to be pious innocences above all others, they look upon them as the dainties and delicacies of their lust. In order to seduce such women, being deceitful, they first think out artifices and then, imbuing their talents therewith and undeterred by shame, they practice them as though they were natural. Their artifices are chiefly simulations of innocence, love, chastity, and piety. By these and other cunning means, they enter into interior friendship with the virgins and so into their love. By various persuasions and at the same time insinuations, they then turn this love from spiritual into natural, and later, by incitements, into corporeal-carnal love, and then they take possession of them at their pleasure. With this accomplished, they rejoice in heart and laugh to scorn those whom they have violated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #513 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>513. XXIV. THE LUST OF SEDUCING INNOCENCES<p>The lust of seducing innocences is not the lust of defloration or the lust of violation, but a peculiar and separate lust by itself. It is found especially with deceivers. The women whom these men consider innocences are women who regard the evil of whoredom as a monstrous sin and who devote themselves therefore both to chastity and to piety; toward them these men grow warm. In Roman Catholic countries it is the conventual virgins; believing these to be pious innocences above all others, they regard them as the dainties and delicacies of their lust. Being deceivers, to seduce such women they first contrive a procedure, and, having imbued their whole nature with it, undeterred by shame, put it into execution with all naturalness. The schemes are chiefly simulations of innocence, love, chastity and piety. By these and other artifices they enter into the interior friendship of such women and then into their love, and by various persuasions and at the same time suggestions they turn their love from spiritual to natural, then carnal by bodily contacts, and thus take possession of them at their pleasure. Having accomplished this, they are jubilant and laugh the violated women to scorn. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #513 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>513. ON THE LUST OF SEDUCING INNOCENCES<p>The lust of seducing innocences is not the lust of defloration, and not the lust of violation, but is peculiar and singular by itself. It exists especially with the crafty. The women who appear to them as innocences are those who regard the evil of scortation as an enormous sin, and who therefore, strive for chastity and at the same time for piety. Towards these they burn. In countries of the Catholic religion there are monastic virgins. As they believe these to be pious innocences before all others, they regard them as the dainties and delicacies of their lust. That they may seduce the ones or the others, being crafty they first devise artifices, and then, after they have imbued their genius with them, without being withdrawn by shame, they practise them as if from nature. Their artifices are chiefly simulations of innocence, of love, of chastity, and of piety. By these and other crafty wiles they enter into their interior friendship and thence into their love; and this, by various persuasions and at the same time insinuations, they turn from spiritual into natural; and after that, by excitations on the corporeal plane into carnal love, and then they, take possession of them at pleasure; having accomplished this, they rejoice in heart, and laugh to scorn those whom they have violated. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #513 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>513. De Libidine seducendi Innocentias <p>Libido seducendi Innocentias, non est Libido deflorationis, nec libido violationis, sed est peculiaris et singularis per se; datur imprimis apud dolosos. Foeminae, quae apparent illis ut innocentiae, sunt quae malum scortationis ut enorme peccatum reputant, et quae sic castitati et simul pietati student; ad has ardent: in Regnis Religionis Catholicae sunt Virgines monasteriales; quia has credunt prae omnibus reliquis pias innocentias, has spectant ut libidinis suae cupedias et lautitias. Ut has aut illas seducant, quia dolosi sunt, primum excogitant artes, et dein, postquam illis genium suum imbuerant, absque retractione a pudore sicut a natura illas exercent: artes imprimis sunt simulationes innocentiae, amoris, castitatis et pietatis; per has et per alias astutias intrant in interiorem amicitiam illarum, et inde in amorem, et hunc per varias persuasiones et simul insinuationes a spirituali vertunt in naturalem, ac postea per irritationes in corporeo carnalem, et tunc ex lubitu possident illas; quibus peractis gaudent corde, ac violatas irrident. </p>
