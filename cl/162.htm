<h4 align="center"></h4><p>162、⑹这种联结从婚姻最初的日子起就逐渐进行，对那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人来说，它会变得越来越深入，直到永远。婚姻最初的热并不产生联结，因为它源于两性情爱，这爱是属身体的，并由此影响灵。凡出于身体而在灵里的，都不会长久；但出于灵而在身体里的爱则可持久。属于灵并从灵进入身体的爱情，连同友谊和相互信任被注入夫妻的灵魂和心智。当这二者（即友谊和相互信任）与婚姻最初的爱结合在一起时，这爱就变成了婚姻之爱，并打开夫妻的心扉，将爱情的甜蜜注入他们。这一过程会随着友谊和信任被添加到原初之爱中而越来越深入，并且这原初之爱会融入这种友谊和信任，而这种友谊和信任也会融入这原初之爱。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>162、（6）这种结合从婚姻第一天起渐渐加深，处于真正的婚姻之爱中的人的这种结合会持续到永远，婚姻中最初的热情并不能使二人结合，因为这种热情有对异性的爱的性质，这是一种属于躯体的爱，在精神上它是因为躯体的爱而存在，因此它不会持久。属于精神的爱并且因为精神而存在于躯体上的爱会潜入灵魂及思想。夫妻间的友谊及信任也是这样，当友谊和相互的信任与最初的爱相结合而产生婚姻后，婚姻之爱就产生了，这种爱能打开双方的心扉，激发甜美的爱。这种爱会因友谊和信任而越来越深，最初的爱会渗入到友谊和信任中，友谊和信任也会渗入到最初的爱中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #162 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>162. (vi) That linking takes place by stages from the first days of a marriage, and in the case of those who enjoy truly conjugial love it becomes deeper and deeper for ever.<p>The first heat of marriage does not make a link, for it derives from sexual love, which is bodily and in that way affects the spirit. Whatever in the spirit is of bodily origin does not last long; but love which is of spiritual origin in the body does last. The love of the spirit, and love of spiritual origin in the body, is instilled into the souls and minds of married couples together with friendship and trust. When these two are combined with the first love of marriage, this becomes conjugial love, opening their hearts and breathing into them the sweetness of love; and it does so more and more deeply as friendship and trust attach themselves to the earliest love, and the love pervades them and they pervade the love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #162 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>162. 6. This union takes place gradually from the first days of marriage, and in people who are in a state of truly conjugial love, it becomes deeper and deeper to eternity. The first heat in marriage does not join two people together, because it draws its character from a love for the opposite sex, which is a love belonging to the body and on that account to the spirit. And whatever is in the spirit as a result of the body does not last long. But love that is in the body as a result of the spirit does last. Love belonging to the spirit, and to the body as a result of the spirit, is insinuated into the souls and minds of married partners together with friendship and mutual trust. When friendship and mutual trust join together with the first love in marriage, conjugial love results, which opens the partners' hearts and inspires in them the sweet enjoyments of love, and this more and more deeply as friendship and trust are added to the original love, and as that original love enters into this friendship and trust and they into it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #162 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>162. 6. This conjunction takes place steadily from the first days of marriage, and among those who have a real married love, it becomes deeper and deeper forever. The first warmth of marriage does not unite, for it comes out of sexual love, which is bodily and in that way spiritual. Anything in your spirit that comes from your body does not last long. But bodily love that comes from your spirit does last. Spiritual love, and bodily love that comes from spiritual, enters the married partners' souls and minds together with friendship and trust. When these two join with the first love of marriage it becomes married love, which opens up their hearts and breathes the sweetness of love into them - more and more deeply as the two join themselves to the first love. It enters them, and they enter it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #162 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>162. VI. THAT FROM THE FIRST DAYS OF MARRIAGE THIS CONJUNCTION IS EFFECTED SUCCESSIVELY, AND WITH THOSE WHO ARE IN LOVE TRULY CONJUGIAL, MORE AND MORE DEEPLY TO ETERNITY. The first heat of marriage does not conjoin, for it partakes of love of the sex which is a love belonging to the body and thence to the spirit, and what is in the spirit from the body does not stay long, while love which is in the body from the spirit does. Love which belongs to the spirit and from the spirit to the body is insinuated into the souls and minds of married partners together with friendship and confidence. When these two conjoin themselves with the first love of marriage, that love becomes conjugial; and this opens the breasts and breathes into them the sweets of love, doing this more and more deeply as friendship and confidence adjoin themselves to the primitive love, and the latter enters into them and they into it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #162 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>162. (vi) This conjunction is effected gradually from the first days of marriage, and with those in true marital love, more and more profoundly to eternity. The first heat of marriage does not conjoin, for it is derived from sexual love, which is of the body and thence of the spirit. What is from the body in the spirit does not last long, but love which is from the spirit in the body, endures. Love which is of the spirit and of the body from the spirit, is insinuated into the souls and minds of the partners, together with friendship and trust. When friendship and trust are joined to the first love of marriage, marital love comes to be, which opens the bosoms and inspires in them the sweetnesses of love; and this, more and more profoundly, as friendship and trust join the first love, and it enters them and they enter it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #162 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>162. (6) That this conjunction is effected successively from the first days of marriage; and that with those who are in love truly conjugial it is effected more and more inwardly to eternity. The first heat of marriage does not conjoin, for it draws from the love of the sex, which is of the body and thence of the spirit; and what is from the body in the spirit does not long endure. But love which is from the spirit in the body is enduring. Love that is of the spirit, and of the body from the spirit, is insinuated into the souls and minds of married partners, together with friendship and confidence. When these two conjoin themselves with the first love of marriage it becomes conjugial love, which opens the hearts, and breathes into them the sweets of love; and this more and more inwardly as the two adjoin themselves to the primitive love and that enters into them; and the reverse. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #162 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>162. VI: Quod Conjunctio illa fiat a primis diebus conjugii successive; et quod apud illos, qui in Amore vere conjugiali sunt, penitius et penitius in aeternum. Primus calor conjugii non conjungit, trahit enim ex amore sexus, qui est corporis et inde spiritus; et quod ex corpore in spiritu est, hoc non moratur diu; sed amor qui est ex spiritu in corpore, moratur: amor spiritus, et e spiritu corporis, insinuatur animabus et mentibus conjugum una cum amicitia et confidentia; cum hae duae cum amore primo conjugii se conjungunt, fit Amor conjugialis, qui aperit pectora, et inspirat illis amoris dulcedines; et hoc penitius et penitius, sicut illae duae primitivo amori se adjungunt, et ille intrat in has, et vicissim. </p>
