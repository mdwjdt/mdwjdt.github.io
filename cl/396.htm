<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第396节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>396、⑼它还流入父母的灵魂，与孩子里面的纯真气场结合起来，尤其通过触摸被注入。主的纯真流入第三层天堂的天使，那里的所有人都享有智慧的纯真。这纯真会经过低层天堂，不过，仅经过那里天使的纯真，从而直接和间接流入小孩子。小孩子和雕刻的形式差不多，不过，他们能经由天堂从主接受生命。但是，除非父母也在其灵魂和心智的至内在区域接受这流注，否则，孩子的纯真将无法感染他们。两个人之间若要建立联系，对方里面必须有某种相匹配和同种类的事物，以实现这种联系，并允许接受、感染、从而联结。否则，孩子的纯真就像落到岩石上的一粒脆弱种子，或被扔给狼的一只羔羊。这就是为何流入父母灵魂的纯真与孩子的纯真形成一种联结。<br><br>父母从经验可获知，这种联结是通过身体感官这个媒介，尤其通过触摸而实现的。例如，视觉以观看孩子为至乐；听觉以听他们说话为至乐；嗅觉则以他们身上的气味为至乐。纯真的交流、因而联结尤其通过触摸实现，这一点从把他们揽在臂弯、抱在怀里并亲吻他们时所感受到的快乐清楚看出来。尤其是母亲，她们以将嘴和脸贴到孩子的胸脯上，同时用手掌抚摸为快乐。一般来说，她们乐享孩子吮吸乳房并吃奶，也乐享抚摸他们的赤身，不知疲倦地把他们抱在膝上，包裹并清洁他们。<br><br>前面数处说明，夫妻之间的爱情及其快乐的交流通过触觉实现。心智的交流也由此实现，因为手是人的最末端，他的在先之物同时存在于他的末端。此外，身体的一切事物和心智的一切事物，作为居间事物通过这种感觉被凝聚在一个牢不可破的纽带中。这就是为何耶稣会给孩子按手（马太福音19:13，15;马可福音10:13，16），通过触摸医好病人，并且凡摸祂的人都痊愈了。这也是为何如今牧师就职时要行按手礼。由此明显可知，父母的纯真与孩子的纯真通过触摸，尤其手的触摸彼此交集，从而如同通过亲吻那样联结起来。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>396、（9）它还会流入到父母的灵魂中去，并与小孩子的氛围相结合。这是主要通过触觉而完成的。主的纯真流入到第三层天堂中，那里的一切天使都处于纯真的智慧之中。这种纯真会继续传入到低层天堂中，但是只是通过天使而传入。并且直接或间接地传入到小孩子中。尽管小孩子处于一种与塑造出的人型没多大区别的状态中，他们仍是通过天国接受来自于主的生命的形式。</p><p>然而，若父母不能接受那种流入，并进入到他们的灵魂和头脑的最内层，小孩子的纯真则不能影响到父母。相似或相当的成份必须要存在，才会使交流成为可能，产生情感和联合。否则就会象种子落到石头上，或将小羊投向狼一样。</p><p>这就是小孩子的纯真能流入到父母的灵魂中并与小孩子的纯真相结合。</p><p>这点是通过感觉而完成的，可以从经验中得知。比如，人会看到小孩子时感到快乐，会在听到他们的声音或闻到他们的气味时感到高兴等。</p><p>这种结合主要是通过触觉来完成的，可以通过怀抱着小孩而实现。通过亲亲孩子，抱抱他们而形成。尤其是母亲们，会通过接触孩子的脸，手或给他们喂奶而感到快乐。还会通过拍拍他们光着的身体，给他们换尿布或洗澡而感到快乐。</p><p>在前面我们讲过多次，婚姻之爱的快乐在配偶间是通过触觉实现的。头脑的交流也是这样进行的，因为手是人的末端知觉。这就是为什么基督摸了小孩子（《马太福音》19:13，15《马可福音》10:13，16 ）他通过接触病人而使他们康复。这也是为什么牧师如今要通过按手仪式而进入其工作生涯。</p><p>很明显父母的纯真和小孩子的纯真是通过接触实现的，尤其是手的接触。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #396 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>396. (ix) It also influences the souls of the parents, and links itself with the same sphere in children. It is above all by touch that it is instilled.<p>The Lord's innocence flows into the angels of the third heaven, where all enjoy the innocence of wisdom, and it passes through the lower heavens, but only through the innocence of angels there, and so directly and indirectly into children. Children are hardly different from carved forms, but for their ability to receive life from the Lord through the heavens. But if the parents too were not to receive that influence in their souls and in the inmost parts of their minds, the innocence of children would be unable to affect them. There must be something matching and similar in kind in the other for communication to be established, and to permit reception, affection and so linking. Without this it would be like a delicate seed falling on a rock, or like a lamb thrown to a wolf. That then is why the innocence flowing into the souls of parents makes a link with the innocence of children.</p><p>[2] Experience can show that this link is established among parents with the help of the bodily senses, but above all through touch. For instance, the sense of sight is intimately charmed by watching children, that of hearing by their talk, that of smell by smelling them. The fact that the chief mode of communication and linking is by touch is evident from the pleasantness of carrying them in one's arms, of hugging and kissing them, especially by their mothers, for they take delight in having their mouths and faces pressed on their laps and at the same time by touching them there with their hands. Generally speaking, they enjoy having them suck their breasts and take milk, and touching their bare bodies, and they never tire of taking them on their knees to wrap them up and to clean them.</p><p>[3] It was shown in several places above that love and its delights are imparted between married couples by the sense of touch. This too serves to impart mental states, because the hands are the last part of a person, and his first is at the same time present in his last. By this means all the parts of the body and all the parts of the mind, which lie between, are held together in an indissoluble bond. This is why Jesus touched children (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_16.htm">16</a>), and He healed the sick by touching them; and those who touched Him were cured. This too is why today the ordination of priests is by the laying on of hands. These facts make it plain that the innocence of parents and that of children meet in touching, especially by the hands, and so they become linked as if by kisses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #396 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>396. 9. It also flows into the souls of the parents, and joins itself with the same atmosphere in the little children; being insinuated principally through the instrumentality of touch. The innocence of the Lord flows into angels of the third heaven, where all are in an innocence of wisdom; passes on through the lower heavens, but only through the innocent affections of angels there; and so descends directly and indirectly into little children. Although little children are in a state not much different from that of sculpted forms, still they are receptive of life from the Lord through the heavens.<p>Nevertheless, if parents did not receive that influx also in their souls and in the inmost levels of their minds, the innocence of their little children would fail to affect them. An equivalent and comparable element must exist in another for communication to take place, and to bring about reception, affection, and so conjunction. Otherwise it would be like a tender seed falling on flint, or like a lamb thrown to a wolf.<p>That, now, is the reason for the statement, that innocence flowing into the souls of parents joins itself with the innocence of little children.</p><p>[2] The fact that this conjunction is occasioned in parents through the instrumentality of the physical senses, but especially through that of touch, is something we can know from experience. As for example, that the vision is inmostly delighted by the sight of them, the hearing by their speech, and the sense of smell by their fragrance.<p>Evidence that the communication and thus conjunction of innocent states is occasioned especially through the instrumentality of touch is clearly seen from the gratification of carrying them in one's arms, and from their hugs and kisses - especially in the case of mothers, who are delighted by the resting of their mouth and face upon their bosoms, and at the same time then by the touch of their hands there; in general, by their suckling at their breasts and nursing; and in addition, by the patting of their naked body, and by their untiring work of diapering them and washing them upon their knees.</p><p>[3] We have already shown several times before that communications of love and its delights between married partners are occasioned through the sense of touch. Communications of the mind are also occasioned by it, for the reason that the hands are the terminal elements of a person, and his first elements are present together in the terminal ones. This is also what holds all things of the body and all things of the mind that are intermediate in an unbroken connection. So it is that Jesus touched little children (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_16.htm">16</a>); and also that He healed the sick by touching them, <sup >2</sup>and those were healed who touched Him. That, too, is why inaugurations into the priesthood today are performed by the laying on of hands.<p>It is apparent from this that the innocence of parents and the innocence of little children meet through the instrumentality of touch, especially through that of the hands, and thus join themselves as though by kisses.<p><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_15.htm">8:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_29.htm">9:29-30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_34.htm">20:34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_42.htm">42</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_7_33.htm">7:33-35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_22.htm">8:22-25</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_13.htm">Luke 5:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_14.htm">7:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_51.htm">22:51</a>.<p><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_14_35.htm">14:35-36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_3_10.htm">Mark 3:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_5_27.htm">5:27-29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_6_56.htm">6:56</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_19.htm">Luke 6:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_43.htm">8:43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_44.htm">44</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_47.htm">47</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #396 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>396. 9. It also influences the parents' souls and joins itself with the same aura in the children, and it is induced especially through touch.<p>The Lord's innocence flows into the angels of the third heaven, where everyone has wisdom's innocence, and it goes through the lower heavens - but only through the innocence of the angels there - and thus it goes into children directly and indirectly. They are almost like sculpted models, but they can still receive life from the Lord through the heavens.<p>But if the parents did not also receive this influence in their souls and in the innermost parts of their minds, they would be affected by the innocence of the children for nothing. There has to be something equal and similar in another person to provide communication and to get reception, affection, and thus conjunction.<p>Otherwise it would be like a delicate seed falling on flint, or like a lamb thrown to a wolf. This, then, is the way innocence, flowing into the parents' souls, joins together with the innocence of children.<p>Experience can teach that this rapport happens for parents by way of the body's senses - but mainly through touch. For instance, sight is deeply pleased by looking at them, hearing by their voices, smell by their smell. You can see clearly that communication, and rapport through it, with innocence is mainly made by touch, from the pleasure of carrying them in your arms, of hugging and kissing them, especially in the case of mothers, who delight in their resting their mouth and face on their bosoms, and the touch of their hands there at that same time, and in general from the sucking on their breasts and giving milk. Also from feeling their naked bodies and from the untiring work of diapering them and cleaning them on their laps.<p>It has already been pointed out several times that between married partners communication of love and its delights is done through the sense of touch. Communication of their minds is also made by touch because hands are a person's most outward parts, and the essential person is in the most outward parts at the same time. Touch also holds together everything in the body and everything in the mind, which is in between, in an unbroken connection.<p>This is why Jesus touched the little children (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>,<p>15; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_16.htm">16</a>), and why He healed the sick by touch, and why those who touched Him were healed. This is also why initiation into the ministry today is done by laying on of hands.<p>These things show that the parents' innocence and the children's innocence meet each other through touch - especially of hands - and in this way they join them together the same as kisses do. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #396 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>396. IX. THAT IT FLOWS ALSO INTO THE SOULS OF PARENTS AND CONJOINS ITSELF WITH THE SAME SPHERE WITH INFANTS; AND THAT IT IS INSINUATED MORE ESPECIALLY BY TOUCH. The Lord's innocence flows into angels of the third heaven where all are in the innocence of wisdom, and passes through the lower heavens, but only through the innocence of the angels there, and so into infants. [Thus it flows into infants] both immediately and mediately. They are little more than sculptured forms, yet they are capable of receiving life from the Lord through the heavens. But unless the parents also received that influx in their souls and in the inmost regions of their minds, they would be affected by the innocence of their infants in vain. (If there is to be communication between one person and another), there must be in that other something adequate and homogeneous by which communication may be effected and which shall make for reception, affection, and hence conjunction. Otherwise it would be like tender seed falling on flint, or a lamb thrown to a wolf.</p><p>[2] Hence then it is, that the innocence flowing into the souls of parents conjoins itself with the innocence of their infants. That the conjunction is effected by the mediation of the senses of the body, but especially by touch, can be learned by parents from experience. Thus, the sight is inmostly delighted at seeing them, the hearing by their speech, the smell by their odor. That the communication and thence the conjunction of the innocences is effected especially by the touch, is manifestly perceived from the pleasure felt in carrying them in the arms, and from hugging and kissing them. This is especially the case with mothers. They experience delight from the pressure of their mouth and face against their bosom and, at the same time, from the touch of their palms there, and, in general, from the sucking of the breasts and the giving suck; also from stroking their naked body and the unwearied labor of swathing and cleansing them on their knees.</p><p>[3] That between married partners, communications of love and its delights are effected by the sense of touch, has been shown several times above. That thereby communication of minds also is effected, is because the hands are the ultimates of man, and in ultimates his prior things are present simultaneously. By this sense, moreover, all things of the body and all things of the mind, being things intermediate, are held together in unbroken connection. Hence it is that Jesus touched infants (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_16.htm">16</a>), that by touch He healed the sick, and that they were healed who touched Him. Hence also it is that at this day, inauguration into the priesthood is made by the laying on of hands. From the above, it is clear that the innocence of parents and that of infants meet each other by means of touch, especially by touch of the hands and so are conjoined as though by kisses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #396 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>396. (ix) Innocence also flows into the souls of parents, conjoining itself with the same sphere in infants, and is insinuated especially through touch. The Lord's innocence flows into the angels of the third heaven (all of whom are in the innocence of wisdom), traverses the lower heavens, but only through the innocence of the angels there, and thus flows immediately and mediately into infants. These are almost like sculptured forms, and yet receptive of life from the Lord through the heavens. Unless parents also received that influx, however, in their souls and in the inmosts of their minds, they would not be affected by the innocence of the infants. There must be what is accommodated and kindred in another for communication to be effected, and to give reception, affection and thence conjunction. Otherwise it would be like tender seed falling on flint or like a lamb thrown to a wolf. Therefore an innocence flows into the souls of parents which conjoins itself with the innocence of infants.</p><p>[2] Experience teaches that this conjunction is effected with parents through the mediation of the bodily senses, especially the touch; as that the sight is deeply delighted watching them, the hearing by their speech, the smell by their odor.

Hence it is that Jesus touched the little children (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_16.htm">16</a>); and healed the sick through touch; and those who touched Him were healed; hence, too, inaugurations into the priesthood today are effected by the laying on of hands. It is plain from these considerations that the innocence of parents and the innocence of infants meet through the touch, especially the touch of the hands, and thus are conjoined as though by kisses. </p>

That communications of love and its delights between married partners are made through the sense of touch, has been shown several times above. Communications of the mind also are thereby effected, because the hands are the ultimates of man and his firsts are together in the ultimates.
