<h4 align="center"></h4><p>379、⒁男人和丈夫所感觉到的嫉妒不同于女人和妻子所感觉到的。不过，准确区分这些不同是不可能的，因为嫉妒因不同类型的夫妻而各异，如：以属灵的方式相爱的夫妻和仅以属世的方式相爱的夫妻；性情各异的夫妻和使对方臣服于顺服枷锁的夫妻。就本身而言，男人的嫉妒不同于女人的。男人的嫉妒源于理解，而女人的嫉妒源于附着于丈夫理解的意愿。因此，男人的嫉妒就像一团怒气和烈怒的火焰；而女人的嫉妒则像一团被制约的火焰，这些制约来自各种恐惧；对丈夫的各种态度；对自己爱情的各种看法；在防止通过嫉妒向丈夫透露这爱上的各种谨慎。这两种嫉妒之所以不同，是因为妻子是爱，而男人是接受者；对妻子来说，在她们的男人面前挥霍自己的爱情是可憎的；但对那爱的接受者来说，在她们的妻子面前挥霍自己的爱情则不然。<br><br>属灵人的情况不同。对他们来说，丈夫的嫉妒会传给妻子，就像妻子的爱传给丈夫一样。因此，在这二者里面，抵御入侵者企图的嫉妒看上去是一样的；不过，妻子抵御妓女入侵者企图的嫉妒会被注入丈夫；这就嫉妒就像一种悲泣，刺痛良心。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>379、（14）男人或丈夫中的嫉妒与女人或妻子中的嫉妒不同。</p><p>在此我们不可能一一列举其中的不同。</p><p>男人的嫉妒与女人的嫉妒不同是因为它来自于不同的源头。男人的嫉妒存在于才智之中，而女人的嫉妒存在于与他的男人的智慧相联的她的意愿中。男人的嫉妒象是怒火，而女人的嫉妒则伴随着不同的畏惧。这与她们对待丈夫的方式有关，与她们对自己的爱的看法有关，与对隐藏嫉妒不展示对丈夫的爱的谨慎性有关。这些不同点之所以存在是因为妻子们是爱的形式，而男人是爱的接受者，妻子要小心不去伤害对男人的爱，而男人则不需要有这方面的顾忌。</p><p>在精神性的人中，情况则是不同的。他们中，男人的嫉妒传给了妻子，而妻子的爱传给了丈夫。所以两者中的嫉妒会一起反抗任何入侵者。在反抗妓女的干扰时，妻子的嫉妒会进入到丈夫中，感觉上象是一种动心的哭泣。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #379 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>379. (xiv) The jealousy felt by men and husbands is different from that felt by women and wives.<p>But these distinctions cannot be clearly made, since jealousy is different in the case of married couples who love each other spiritually and with those who love only naturally; different in the case of those whose dispositions differ and with those who have subjected their partner to the yoke of obedience. The jealousy of men is, regarded in itself, different from that of women. Men's jealousy has its origins in the intellect, women's in the will attached to the husband's intellect. Men's jealousy therefore is like a flash of exasperation and anger; that of women is like a fire, restrained by varying fears, by varying views taken of the husband, by varying relations to their own love, and varying prudence which prevents them through jealousy from revealing that love to their husband. These distinctions exist because wives are loves and men are receivers of love. It is injurious for wives to waste their love on husbands, but not so much for those who receive love to waste it on wives.</p><p>[2] It is different in the case of spiritual people. In their case the husband's jealousy is passed to the wife, just as her love is passed to the husband. It therefore looks as if it is similarly on either side designed to confront one who violates it. But a wife's jealousy is breathed into her husband to resist the efforts of a whore to violate it; this jealousy is like a pain which brings tears to the eyes and stings the conscience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #379 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>379. 14. Jealousness in men and husbands is different from jealousness in women and wives. Having said that, however, we cannot separately describe all the differences, since jealousness is of one character in partners who love each other spiritually, of another character in partners who love each other only naturally, of another character in partners who differ in disposition and spirit, and of another character in partners, one of whom has subjugated the other into a condition of subservience.<p>Regarded in themselves, jealousness in men and jealousness in women are different, being from a different origin. The origin of jealousness in men is in the intellect, whereas in women it is in the will adjoined to the intellect of her man. Jealousness in men is therefore like a blaze of fury and anger, while in women it is like a fire contained by various fears, by the varying ways in which they regard their husbands, by the varying ways in which they view their own love, and by their varying degrees of prudence in not revealing their love to their husbands by a display of jealousness. These differences exist, because wives are forms of love, and men recipients; and wives have to be careful not to destroy their love in men, whereas its recipients do not have to exercise the same care with their wives.</p><p>[2] The situation is different in the case of spiritual people. In their case the man's jealousness is transmitted to the wife, as the wife's love is transmitted to the husband; and therefore the jealousness in one and the other against the attempts of a transgressor appear alike. However, against the attempts of a transgressing trollop the wife's jealousness is infused into the husband, which is felt as grief weeping and moving the conscience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #379 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>379. 14. Jealousy is different in men and husbands than in women and wives. But these differences cannot be given precisely, because jealousy is different in married partners who love each other spiritually, in partners who are merely worldly, in partners whose souls disagree, and in a partner who puts a spouse under his yoke of obedience.<p>Seen as they are, the jealousies of men and women are different, because they come from different sources. The source of a man's jealousy is in his intellect, but the source of a woman's is in her will, attached to her husband's intellect. So a man's jealousy is like a flame of anger and wrath breaking out, but a woman's is like a fire controlled by varying fear, a varying glance at her husband, a varying regard for her love, and a varying skill in not disclosing it to her husband through jealousy. They differ because wives are loves and men are recipients, and it hurts wives to spread their love among men but not likewise the recipients among women.<p>But to be sure, it is different with spiritual people. For them the husband's jealousy is transferred to the wife, as the wife's love is transferred to the husband, so it seems the same to both of them - jealousy against the violator's effort. But a wife's jealousy against a violating prostitute is inspired into the man as weeping grief and a prodding of his conscience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #379 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>379. XIV. THAT JEALOUSY WITH MEN AND HUSBANDS IS DIFFERENT FROM JEALOUSY WITH WOMEN AND WIVES. The differences, however, cannot be distinctly set forth; for with married partners, jealousy is of one kind with those who love each other spiritually, of another with those who love each other only naturally, of another with those who are of dissident minds, and of another with one who has subjected the other to the yoke of obedience. Considered in themselves, manly and wifely jealousy are different, being from different origins. The origin of manly jealousy is in the understanding, but that of wifely jealousy is in the will applied to the understanding of their men. Therefore, manly jealousy is as a flame of wrath and anger, but wifely jealousy is as a fire restrained by a variety of fears, a variety of attitudes to the husband, a variety of regards to her own love, and a variety in her prudence in not disclosing this love to the husband by jealousy. These two kinds of jealousy are distinguished, because wives are loves and men are recipients; and to wives it is obnoxious to be prodigal <sup >1</sup>of their love before their men, but not so to the recipients of that love before their wives. It is different with the spiritual.</p><p>[2] With these, the man's jealousy is transferred to the wife, just as the wife's love is transferred to the man. Therefore, in both, the jealousy against the attempts of a violator appears to be the same; but the Wife's jealousy against the attempts of a harlot violator is inspired in the man as grief weeping and moving the conscience.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin has disperdere (to destroy), but clearly this is a misprint for dispendere, as in the translation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #379 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>379. (xiv) Jealousy in men and husbands is different from jealousy in women and wives. The differences cannot be definitely stated, however, for jealousy is one thing with partners who love each other spiritually, another with partners who love each other only naturally, still another with partners of discordant mind, and yet another with partners, one of whom has brought the other under a yoke of obedience to himself. Masculine and feminine jealousy, viewed in themselves, are diverse, being so different in origin. The origin of masculine jealousy is in the understanding, but of feminine jealousy in the will allied with the man's understanding. Masculine jealousy is therefore like a flame of wrath and anger, but feminine jealousy is like a restrained fire - restrained by the special fear, the particular regard for the husband, the particular concern for her own love, and by the prudence a wife possesses about not betraying her love to the husband through jealousy. The two jealousies differ because wives are loves and men recipients; it is prejudicial to wives to be prodigal of their love with men, but not for recipients to be prodigal of theirs with their wives. But it is otherwise with the spiritual. With them the man's jealousy is conveyed to the wife, as the wife's love is to the man; therefore they seem to each other jointly opposed to the effort of a violator. The wife's jealousy against the effort of a harlot violator is inspired into the husband, and is like a grief lamenting and stirring the conscience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #379 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>379. (14) That jealousy with men and husbands is of another kind than with women and wives. But the differences cannot be distinctly defined, because jealousy is of one kind with married partners who love each other spiritually, of another kind with partners who only love naturally; of one kind with partners who are of discordant mind, and of another with married partners of whom one has brought the other partner under the yoke of obedience to themselves. The jealousies of men and of women are different, viewed in themselves, because of different origin. The origin of virile jealousies is in the understanding, but of womanly jealousies, in the will applied to the understanding of her husband. And therefore, virile jealousy is as a flame of wrath and anger; and womanly, as a fire restrained by a varying fear, a varying aspect towards her husband, a varying regard to her own love, and a varying prudence not to discover this love to her husband by jealousy. They are distinguished by the fact that wives are loves, and men are recipients; and to be prodigal of their love is prejudicial to wives with men, but is not likewise prejudicial to the recipients with wives. But it is otherwise with the spiritual. With them the jealousy of the man is transferred to the wife, just as the wife's love is transferred to the man; and therefore, they appear each to the other alike opposed to the endeavor of a violator. But the jealousy of a wife against the endeavor of a harlot violator is breathed into the man, which is as grief weeping, and moving the conscience. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #379 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>379. XIV. Quod Zelotypia apud viros et maritos alia sit, quam apud foeminas et uxores. Sed discrimina illa non possunt distincte tradi, quoniam Zelotypia alia est apud conjuges qui se spiritualiter amant, alia apud conjuges qui modo naturaliter, alia apud conjuges qui dissident animis, et alia apud conjuges qui consortem sub jugum obedientiae suae miserunt: <sup>1</sup>viriles et muliebres Zelotypiae <sup>2</sup>in se spectatae sunt diversae, quia ex alia origine; origo Zelotypiarum virilium est in intellectu, at muliebrium in voluntate applicata intellectui sui viri; quare Zelotypia virilis est sicut flamma excandescentiae et irae; at muliebris est sicut ignis coercitus vario timore, vario aspectu ad maritum, vario respectu ad suum amorem, et varia prudentia non aperiendi hunc maritis per Zelotypiam; discriminantur, quia uxores sunt amores, ac viri recipientes; ac obest uxoribus amorem suum disperdere apud viros, sed non similiter recipientibus apud uxores.</p><p>[2] Aliter vero apud Spirituales; apud hos Zelotypia viri transfertur in uxorem, sicut amor uxoris transfertur in virum, quare utrinque apparet sibi similis contra conatus violatoris; sed uxoris Zelotypia inspiratur viro contra conatus scorti violatricis, quae est sicut dolor lachrymans, et conscientiam emovens. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: misit:<br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: Zolotypiae </p>
