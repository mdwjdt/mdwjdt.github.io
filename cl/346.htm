<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第346节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>346、⑾对一夫多妻者来说，婚姻的贞洁、纯粹和圣洁是不可能的。这一点从刚才所给出的证据可推知，从关于“贞洁和不贞洁”（第7章）那一章的说明，尤其从以下几点清楚看出来：贞洁、纯粹和圣洁只归于一夫一妻的婚姻，也就是一个男人和一个妻子的婚姻（141节）；真正的婚姻之爱是贞洁本身，婚姻真爱的一切快乐，甚至最表层的快乐，都是贞洁的（143，144节）。此外，在“真正的婚姻之爱”那一章（第4章）也有几点，如：就其起源和对应而言，真正的婚姻之爱，就是一个男人和一个妻子的爱，是属天、属灵、神圣、纯粹和洁净的，胜过其它一切爱（64节等）。贞洁、纯粹和圣洁只在真正的婚姻之爱中，由此可知，它们并不在或不可能在一夫多妻之爱中。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>346、（11）从上述中我们可以知道这一点，尤其是从以下几点中更可以清楚看到，贞节、纯净只属于一夫一妻的婚姻，另外，真正的婚姻之爱是贞节的精髓。婚姻之爱中的一切快乐都是贞洁的。（见143、144节）。另外在真正的婚姻之爱一章中也会清楚地看到这点。总而言之，只有真正的婚姻之爱才是神圣的，是精神的，是纯净的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #346 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>346. (xi) Chastity, purity and holiness in marriage are impossible for polygamists.<p>This follows from the proof given just above, and plainly from those contained in the chapter on chastity and unchastity [VII], especially the following points made there. Chastity, purity and holiness can only be attributed to monogamous marriages, that is, of one man with one wife (<a href="141.htm">141</a>). Truly conjugial love is the height of chastity, and as a result all the delights of that love, down to the lowest level, are chaste (<a href="143.htm">143-144</a>). There are further points in the chapter on truly conjugial love [IV], such as the following. Truly conjugial love, that of one man with one wife, is by its source and its correspondence more celestial, spiritual, holy and pure than any other love (<a href="64.htm">64</a> ff.). Since chastity, purity and holiness only exist in truly conjugial love, it follows that these are not present or possible in polygamous love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #346 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>346. 11. Conjugial chastity, purity and sanctity are not possible with polygamists. This follows from which we have established just above, and clearly from the considerations demonstrated in the chapter titled "Chastity and its Absence;" especially from the following points there, that chastity, purity and sanctity are ascribed only to monogamous marriages, or to marriages of one man with one wife (no. <a href="141.htm">141</a>); further, that truly conjugial love is the essence of chastity, and that all the delights of truly conjugial love, even the end delights, are chaste (nos. <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="144.htm">144</a>). It follows clearly, moreover, from the considerations presented in the chapter titled "Truly Conjugial Love;" as from these points there, that from its origin and correspondence, truly conjugial love - which is the love of one man with one wife - is celestial, spiritual, holy, pure and clean, more so than any other love (nos. <a href="64.htm">64</a>ff).<p>Now, because chastity, purity and sanctity are present only in truly conjugial love, it follows that they are not present and cannot possibly be present in polygamous love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #346 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>346. 11. For polygamists the chastity, purity, and holiness of marriage are not possible. This is in keeping with the things already established above, and especially with the things pointed out in the chapter about the chaste and unchaste - principally from these things in it: That chaste, pure, and holy only apply to monogamous marriages, of one man with one wife (no. <a href="141.htm">141</a>). That, also, real married love is chastity itself, so all the pleasant things about that love, even the most bodily, are chaste (nos. <a href="143.htm">143-144</a>). And it is also in keeping with the things that were brought up in the chapter about the real love in marriage, such as these: That the real love in marriage, which is love of one man with one wife, is heavenly, spiritual, holy, and clean from its source and from its correspondence, more than all other loves (nos. 64 ff.). Now, chastity, purity, and holiness are only found in real married love, so consequently they are not found and are not possible in polygamous love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #346 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>346. XI. THAT WITH POLYGAMISTS CONJUGIAL CHASTITY, PURITY, AND HOLINESS ARE NOT POSSIBLE. This follows from what was confirmed just above, and manifestly from what was shown in the chapter on The Chaste and the Non-Chaste, especially from the following there: That what is chaste, pure, and holy is predicated only of monogamous marriages or those of one man with one wife (no. 1 <a href="41.htm">41</a>); that love truly conjugial is chastity itself, and that thence all the delights of that love, even the ultimate, are chaste (nos. <a href="143.htm">143, 144</a>). Moreover, it follows from what was adduced in the chapter on Love Truly Conjugial, such as the following: That from its origin and correspondence, love truly conjugial, which is the love of one man with one wife, is celestial, spiritual, holy, pure [and clean], above every other love (no. <a href="64.htm">64</a>). Now because chastity, purity, and holiness have place only in love truly conjugial, it follows that they do not and cannot have place in polygamous love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #346 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>346. (xi) Marital chastity, purity and holiness are not possible in polygamists. This follows from what has just been established, and patently from what was demonstrated in the chapter on the chaste and the non-chaste, especially from these propositions there: the chaste, pure and holy can be predicated only of monogamous marriages or those of one man with one wife (n.141); true marital love is chastity itself, and hence all the delights of that love, including the ultimate, are chaste (n. <a href="143.htm">143-144</a>). It also follows from what was adduced in the chapter on "True Marital Love," as from these propositions there: true marital love, of one man for one wife, by virtue of its origin and correspondence is celestial, spiritual, holy and clean above every other love (n.64). As chastity, purity and holiness are to be had only in true marital love, it follows that they are not to be found in polygamous love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #346 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>346. (11) That with polygamists there cannot be conjugial chastity, purity, and holiness. This follows from the things established just above, and manifestly from what was shown in the chapter on, The Chaste and the Non-chaste, especially from these things in that chapter: That chaste, pure, and holy, are only predicable of monogamous marriages, or those of one man with one wife (n. <a href="141.htm">141</a>); also that love truly conjugial is chastity itself; and that thence all the delights of that love, even the ultimate, are chaste (n. <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="144.htm">144</a>). And moreover from the things which were adduced in the chapter, On Love Truly Conjugial, as, from these things in that chapter: That love truly conjugial, which is of one man with one wife, by virtue of its origin and of its correspondence, is celestial, spiritual, holy, and pure, beyond every love (n. <a href="64.htm">64</a>, and following numbers). Now, as chastity, purity, and holiness, are only in love truly conjugial, it follows that they are not and cannot be in polygamous love. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #346 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>346. XI: Quod apud Polygamos non dabilis sit conjugialis castitas, puritas, et sanctitas. Hoc sequitur ex mox supra confirmatis, ac manifeste ex illis, quae in Capite de Casto et non Casto, demonstrata sunt; imprimis ex his ibi, Quod castum, purum, et sanctum, modo praedicentur de Conjugiis monogamicis, seu unius viri cum una uxore, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_346/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_141" target=_top>141</a>; tum, Quod amor vere conjugialis sit ipsa castitas, et quod inde omnes delitiae amoris illius, etiam ultimae, sint castae, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_346/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_346/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_144" target=_top>144</a>. Et praeterea ex illis, quae in Capite de Amore vere conjugiali, adducta sunt, ut ab his ibi; Quod Amor vere conjugialis, qui est unius viri cum una uxore, ex <sup>1</sup>origine sua, et ex correspondentia sua, sit coelestis, spiritualis, sanctus, mundus prae omni amore, <sup>2</sup>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_346/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_64" target=_top>64</a>. seqq. Nunc, quia castitas, puritas, et sanctitas solummodo dantur <sup>3</sup>in amore vere conjugiali, sequitur quod non dentur <sup>4</sup>nec dabilis sint <sup>5</sup>in amore polygamico.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: en<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: omore,<br><br>3.&nbsp;Prima editio: datur<br><br>4.&nbsp;Prima editio: detur<br><br>5.&nbsp;Prima editio: sit </p>
