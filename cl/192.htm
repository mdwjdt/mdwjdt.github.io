<h4 align="center"></h4><p>192、⑺婚姻还在夫妻的灵魂和心智里面产生不同形式。在尘世，人们很难发现婚姻施加于灵魂和心智的不同形式，因为在那里，灵魂和心智被包裹在一具肉体中，心智很少透过肉体显现。此外，比起古人，这个时代的人更善于从小学习如何伪装面部表情，从而将内心情感深深埋藏起来。由于这个原因，人很难看出心智的形式在婚前和婚后的区别。然而，在灵界，通过观察就能清楚看出灵魂和心智的形式在婚前和婚后有何不同。因为这时，人是灵人和天使，而他们无非是人形的灵魂和心智，脱去了由水陆元素及其散发到空气中的呼出物所构成的覆盖物。当这些东西被脱去后，原本存在于肉体里面的心智形式就变得可见；这时，已婚者和未婚者的区别是显而易见的。一般来说，已婚夫妇的脸有一种内在的美，因为丈夫从妻子那里接受其爱的娇羞，而妻子则从丈夫那里接受其智慧的光辉；事实上，在灵界，夫妻二人在灵魂上被联结起来；而且，他们各自都显为完全的人。这是天堂里的情形，因为真正的婚姻不在别处，只在天堂。天堂之下只有被作成和未被作成的配对。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>192、（7）婚姻甚至还会影响夫妻双方的灵魂和思想。</p><p>在尘世间人们无法看到婚姻会影响人的灵魂和思想，这是因为灵魂和思想受到肉体的束缚，如今，人们从小会就在脸上隐藏自己的真诚情感。</p><p>因此人们看不到自己的思想在婚前和婚后的区别。然而，在精神世界中却可以看到思想在婚前和婚后的不同。因为那时候的人是以精灵或者在使的形式而存在。这时的人是以人形存在的思想或天使，摆脱了曾有的束缚，当摆脱了束缚后，他们思想的形式也就展现出来，此时会清楚地看到这些形式在婚前和婚后是不同的。</p><p>一般来讲，夫妇双方的脸上有一种内在美。丈夫有来自妻子的爱的红晕，妻子有来自于丈夫的智慧的光辉。因为在天国中夫妇双方在灵魂上是相结合的，因为真正婚姻只存在那里，世间所有的只是一种短暂的相聚。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #192 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>192. (vii) Marriage also produces different forms in the souls and minds [of married couples].<p>In the natural world it is not possible to observe that marriage imposes different forms on souls and minds, because there souls and minds are enveloped in a material body, and the mind rarely shows through this. Moreover, people of today are better than the ancients at learning from childhood up how to assume facial expressions which deeply conceal the affections of the mind. This is the reason why it is impossible to recognise the difference between the form people's minds have before and after marriage.<p>However, in the spiritual world it is plain to see by looking at them that the forms of souls and minds are different after marriage from what they were before it. For then people are spirits and angels, who are nothing but minds and souls in human form, stripped of their covering, which had been composed of aqueous and terrestrial elements and their exhalations scattered around in the air. When these have been discarded, the forms of minds, as they had existed within their bodies, become visible; and it is clear that there is a difference between those who are living in a marriage and those who are not. Generally speaking married couples have an inner beauty of face, since the husband gets from his wife the charming blush of her love, and the wife gets from her husband the bright gleam of his wisdom, since there the two partners are united in soul. Moreover, each appears to be fully human. This happens in heaven, because nowhere else are there true marriages; under heaven there are only pairings which are made and unmade. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #192 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>192. 7. Marriage even induces different forms on their souls and minds. In the natural world one cannot observe that marriage induces different forms on their souls and minds, because souls and minds are there enveloped in a material body, and the mind is rarely visible through this. In today's world, moreover, more than in ancient times, people also learn from early childhood to assume expressions on their faces which completely conceal the affections of their minds.<p>For this reason, one cannot see the difference between what the forms of their minds are like before marriage and what they are like afterwards. Nevertheless, it is clearly apparent from souls and minds in the spiritual world that the forms of these after marriage are different from what they had been before; for people are then spirits and angels, who are nothing else than minds and souls in human form, divested of the integuments they had had, which were composed of elements found in waters and earths and of exhalations from these diffused in the air. When these coverings have been cast off, the forms of their minds, and what these forms had been like within their bodies, become visible; and it is clearly seen then that the forms in people who are married are different from the forms in people who are not.<p>In general, the faces of married partners possess an inner beauty, the husband receiving from his wife the lovely blush of her love, and the wife receiving from her husband the shining splendor of his wisdom. For a married couple there is united in respect to their souls; and one also sees in the two a full expression of what it is to be human. This is the case in heaven, because marriages do not exist elsewhere. Beneath heaven one finds instead only temporary alliances which are formed and broken. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #192 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>192. 7. Also, marriages impose different configurations on the souls and minds of the partners. In the natural world it goes unnoticed that marriages bring different configurations to souls and minds because souls and minds there are wrapped up in a material body, and the mind rarely shines through this. And also, people of this era, more than in ancient times, learn from infancy to put expressions on their faces that deeply hide their mental feelings. This is the reason why it goes unnoticed what the conditions of the mind before marriage and after marriage are like.<p>But it is palpably clear from souls and minds in the spiritual world that the forms of souls and minds are different after marriage than they were before it. For then they are spirits and angels, who are nothing other than minds and souls in a human form, stripped of the slough that was made of elements in the water and earth and of vapors from water and earth diffused in the air. Once these are cast off, the forms of minds as they used to be inside their bodies are easy to see, and then it is easy to see that those who live in marriage are one way and those who do not are another.<p>In general, the married have an inner charm in their faces, for the man receives from his wife the beautiful flush of her love, and the wife receives from her husband the sparkling luster of his wisdom, for two married partners there are united in soul. And more than this, a human completeness appears in both of them.<p>This is in heaven, because there are no marriages anywhere else. Below heaven, though, there are only civil marriages, which are made and broken. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #192 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>192. VII. THAT MARRIAGES ALSO INDUCE NEW FORMS UPON THE SOULS AND MINDS [OF THE PARTNERS]. That marriages induce new forms upon souls and minds cannot be observed in the natural world because there, souls and minds are encompassed with a material body, and the mind rarely shows itself. Moreover, the men of this age, more than the ancients, learn from infancy to put expressions on their face whereby they deeply conceal the affections of their mind. This is the reason why the forms of the mind as they are before marriage and as they are after marriage are not distinguished the one from the other. Yet that the forms of souls and minds are different after marriage from what they had been before, is manifestly apparent from these same minds in the spiritual world; for then they are spirits and angels, and these are no other than minds and souls in human form, stripped of the coverings which were composed of elements found in waters or earths, and of exhalations diffused therefrom. When these are cast off, the forms of men's minds are seen, such as they had been inwardly in their bodies, and then it is clearly seen that they are of one kind with those who are living in marriage, and of another with those who are not. In general, married partners have an interior comeliness of face, the man taking from his wife the charming glow of her love, and the wife from the man the luster of his wisdom; for there, two partners are united as to their souls, and a human fullness is apparent in each. This is in heaven, for nowhere else are there marriages. Below heaven are only connubial ties which are made and broken. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #192 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>192. (vii) Marriages also induce other forms on the souls and minds of partners. In the natural world it is not so apparent that marriages induce other forms on souls and minds, for here souls and minds are enclosed in a material body, through which the mind rarely shines. Today, moreover, far more than of old, men learn from infancy onward to induce expressions on the face by which they profoundly conceal the mind's affections. For this reason forms of the mind before and after marriage are not known apart. In the spiritual world, however, it is manifest (even in such men) that the forms of soul and mind after marriage differ from what they were before marriage. For spirits and angels, who are nothing but minds and souls in human form, are then stripped of the coverings which were composed of elements from water and earth and of exhalations thence spread on the air. With these removed, the forms of the minds, such as they were within the body, are seen, and it is clearly observable then that the married have certain forms, and the unmarried other forms. In general, married partners have an inner beauty of countenance, the man receiving from the wife the agreeable glow of her love, and the wife from the man the shining brightness of his wisdom. For the two partners are united in soul. In each appears also a human fullness. This is in heaven, for there are no marriages anywhere else; below heaven there are only matings, which are formed and severed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #192 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>192. (7) That marriages also induce other forms upon the souls and minds. It cannot be observed in the natural world that marriages induce other forms upon the souls and minds, because the souls and minds are there invested with a material body, and the mind rarely shines through this. The men of this age also, more than the ancients, learn from infancy to put on expressions of the face by which they profoundly conceal the affections of the mind; which is the reason why the forms of the mind, as they are before marriage and as they are after marriage, are not discerned. But in the spiritual world it manifestly appears from the same that the forms of souls and minds are different before marriage from what they are after it. For then they are spirits and angels, who are no other than minds and souls in human form, denuded of the coverings which were composed of aqueous and earthy elements, and of exhalations therefrom diffused in the air; which being cast off, the forms of their minds are visible, just as they were inwardly in their bodies, and then it is clearly seen that they are of one kind with those who are living in marriage, and of another kind with those who are not. In general, the married have an interior beauty of face; for the man takes from the wife the charming glow of her love, and the wife from the man the shining brightness of his wisdom. For there, two married partners are united as to their souls; and there is moreover a human fulness apparent in each. This is in heaven; for elsewhere there are no marriages. Below heaven there are only connubial connections that are formed and severed. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #192 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>192. VII. <sup>1</sup>Quod Conjugia etiam inducant animabus et mentibus alias formas. Quod Conjugia inducant animabus et mentibus alias formas, non potest animadverti in Mundo naturali, quia animae et mentes ibi circumcinctae sunt corpore materiali, et per hoc raro mens translucet; et quoque hujus Saeculi homines, plus quam Antiqui, ab infantia discunt inducere faciebus vultus, per quos affectiones mentis profunde abscondunt; quae causa est, quod formae mentium, quales ante conjugium et quales post conjugium sunt, non internoscantur: quod tamen animarum et mentium formae, aliae sint post conjugium, quam fuerant ante illud, manifeste apparet ex iisdem in Mundo spirituali; sunt enim tunc Spiritus et Angeli, qui non aliud sunt quam Mentes et Animae in forma humana, nudatae ab exuviis, quae fuerunt compositae ex elementis in aquis et terris, et ex halitibus inde circumsparsis in aere; quibus ejectis formae mentium, quales fuerant intus in corporibus suis, conspiciuntur, et tunc clare, quod aliae sint illis qui in conjugio vivunt, et aliae illis qui non: in genere est conjugibus interior decor faciei, trahit enim vir ab uxore venustum ruborem amoris ejus, et uxor a viro splendentem nitorem sapientiae ejus; nam duo conjuges ibi quoad animas uniti sunt; et insuper in utroque apparet plenitudo humana: hoc in Coelo, quia non alibi Conjugia sunt; infra Coelum autem sunt modo Connubia, quae nectuntur et dirimuntur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: VI. </p>
