<h4 align="center"></h4><p>389、繁衍的气场和保护所繁衍之物的气场，也就是婚姻之爱的气场和对孩子的爱之气场，之所以自初至末流入天堂的一切事物和尘世的一切事物，是因为从主，也就是从来自祂并且祂在其中的灵界太阳所发出的一切事物，通过整个受造宇宙直达一切事物的最后阶段或终端。原因在于，神性事物就其发展而言，被称为属天和属灵的，它们独立于时空之外。众所周知，延伸无法论及属灵事物，因为属灵事物没有时空的属性。正因如此，凡从主发出之物，都是在一瞬间从最初之物存在于最末之物。婚姻之爱的气场同样如此普遍（参看222-225节）。<br><br>对孩子的爱之气场也一样，这一点从这爱在世上的婴幼儿所在天堂中的存在，以及在世上人类、动物、鸟类、蛇类和昆虫当中的存在明显看出来。甚至植物界和矿物界也有这爱的类似现象：在植物界，保护种子的外壳如同襁褓；另外，种子包含在果实中，如同住在家里；滋养种子的汁液则如同牛奶。矿物当中也有这样的现象，这一点从基质和矿脉明显看出来，因为宝石和贵金属就隐藏并安全保存于其中。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>389、繁衍的氛围和保护已经存在的事物的氛围，或者婚姻之爱的氛围和对小孩子的爱的氛围，充斥于天国和世间，因为它们来自于主，或者说来自于太阳即主。它充斥于宇宙中每个元素。原因是神性事物，其发展是天国性的精神性的是独立于空间和时间的。人们知道精神的事物是不能用尺度来衡量的，因此来自于主的事物会立即贯穿于万物之中。</p><p>关于婚姻之爱是普遍存在的请参见222-225节。</p><p>对小孩子的爱也是普遍存在的也可以明显地看到。它存在于天国中，也存在于世间的人、动物、鸟、蛇及昆虫中。</p><p>类似的爱在植物和矿物中也能看到。植物的种子被果肉、种壳包裹着，并有果汁在滋润它，矿物也一样，比如玉石和宝石被岩石等保护着。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #389 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>389. The reason why the reproductive and protective spheres, that is, those of conjugial love and the love of children, influence everything from first to last in heaven and in the world is that all emanations from the Lord, or from the sun which comes from Him and in which He is present, pass through the whole of creation down to the last stage of everything. This is because what is Divine (and as it advances is called celestial and spiritual) is without space and time. It is well known that extension cannot be predicated of spiritual things, because space and time cannot. Thus it is that whatever emanates from the Lord is in an instant present from first to last. The sphere of conjugial love is similarly universal (<a href="222.htm">222-225</a> above).</p><p>[2] It is obvious that the sphere of the love of children behaves in the same way from the existence of that love in heaven, where there are children from earth. Also from its existence among human beings in the world, among animals and birds, snakes and insects. There are even analogous facts in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms. In the vegetable kingdom seeds are protected by shells as if in wrappings, and in addition they are contained in a fruit as in a house, and nourished with sap as if with milk. There is something similar in ores, as is clear from matrices and lodes in which precious stones and noble metals are stored and kept safe. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #389 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>389. The atmospheres of procreating and of protecting what has been procreated, or the atmospheres of conjugial love and of a love for little children, flow into all things of heaven and into all things of the world, from the firsts to the lasts of them, because whatever emanates from the Lord, or from the sun which is from Him and in which He is, passes through the created universe even to the last of all the elements in it. The reason is that Divine things, which in their progression are called celestial and spiritual, are independent of space and time. People know that there is no ascribing of dimension to spiritual things, because no ascribing of space and time. So it is that whatever emanates from the Lord is in an instant present from first things in last ones.<p>That an atmosphere of conjugial love is thus universal may be seen above in nos. <a href="222.htm">222-225</a>.</p><p>[2] That an atmosphere of love for little children is, too, is apparent from the existence of that love in heaven, where little children from earth are; and from the existence of that love in the world, in people, and in animals and birds, snakes and insects.<p>Analogues of this love are found also in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms. In the vegetable kingdom, seeds are protected by coverings like swaddling clothes, are sheltered in fruit as in a house, and are nourished by the juice as with milk. Something similar is found in the case of minerals, as appears from the matrices and encasements in which fine gems and noble metals are hidden and protected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #389 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>389. The auras of having offspring and of protecting offspring or the auras of married love and of love for children - radiate into everything in heaven and into everything in the world, from first to last, because all things that radiate from the Lord - or from the sun that is from Him and that He is in - go together throughout the created universe, clear to the outermost parts of all the things in it. The reason is that Divine qualities, which are called heavenly and spiritual as they radiate, are outside of space and time. It is well known that nothing related to extent applies to spiritual things, because nothing related to space and time does. Owing to this, whatever radiates from the Lord goes from start to finish instantly. Nos. <a href="222.htm">222-225</a>, above, show that the aura of married love is universal in this way. The fact that the same goes for the aura of the love for children is clear from the presence of that love in heaven, where there are children from the earth, and from the presence of that love in the world in people, animals and birds, snakes and insects. This love even has its analogue in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms - in the vegetable kingdom in that seeds are protected in shells, like baby blankets, and furthermore in fruit as in a home, and they are nourished with sap as if with milk. It is clear that something similar is in minerals from the matrices and coverings that the precious gems and precious metals are concealed and protected in. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #389 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>389. That the spheres of procreating and of protecting what is procreated, that is, the spheres of conjugial love and of the love of infants, flow into all things of heaven and all things of the world from the first thereof to the last, is because all things proceeding from the Lord, that is, from the sun which is from Him and in which He is, pass through the created universe to the very ultimates of all things thereof. The reason is, because things Divine, which in their progression are called celestial and spiritual, are devoid of space and time. It is well known that when speaking of spiritual things there is no predication of extension because none of space and time. Hence it is, that whatever proceeds from the Lord is in things last from things first in an instant. That in this way the sphere of conjugial love is universal may be seen above (nos. <a href="222.htm">222-225</a>).</p><p>[2] That this is likewise the case with the sphere of the love of infants is manifest from that love in heaven where are infants from the earth; also from that love as it is in the world with men and with beasts, birds, serpents, and insects. There are also analogues of that love in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms--in the vegetable kingdom, in that seeds are protected by husks as by swaddling-clothes, are in fruit as in a home, and are nourished with sap as with milk. That there is something like this among minerals is evident from the matrices and coverings wherein noble gems and noble metals are hidden and guarded. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #389 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>389. The spheres of procreating and of protecting what is procreated, or of marital love and of love for children, inflow into all things of heaven and of the world, from first things to last things, because everything which proceeds from the Lord or from the sun which is from Him and in which He is, traverses all creation to the outmost things of all. The reason is that Divine things, which as they proceed are called celestial and spiritual, are free from space and time. It is known that one cannot predicate extension of spiritual things any more than one can predicate space and time of them. Hence it is that whatever proceeds from the Lord is instantly in things last from things first. See above (n. <a href="222.htm">222-225</a>) that the sphere of marital love is thus universal. The sphere of love for children is universal, too, as is plain from the existence of this love in heaven, where are children from the earths; and from its existence in the world with men, beasts and birds, snakes and insects. This love even has analogies in vegetable and mineral kingdoms - in the vegetable in that seeds are protected by husks as by swaddling-clothes, reside in the fruit as in a home, and are nourished with sap as with milk; in minerals, something similar is to be seen in the matrices and housings in which noble gems and metals are hidden and protected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #389 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>389. That the spheres of procreating and of protecting what is procreated, or the spheres of conjugial love and the love of infants, inflow into all things of heaven and into all things of the world, from the first to the last, is because all things that proceed from the Lord, or from the sun which is from Him and in which He is, pass together through the created universe even to the very ultimates of all things thereof. The reason is that things Divine, which in their progression are called celestial and spiritual, are without space and time. It is known that no extent is predicated of things spiritual, because no space and time. Hence it is that what proceeds from the Lord is in an instant from first things in the last. That the sphere of conjugial love is thus universal may be seen above at n. 222-225. That in like manner the sphere of the love of infants is so, is manifest from that love in heaven where there are infants from the earth; and from that love in the world with men, with beasts and birds, serpents and insects.<p>There are also analogies of that love in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms. In the vegetable kingdom, in that seeds are protected by shells, like swaddlings, and besides in fruit as in a house, and are nourished with the sap as with milk That there is something like this among minerals appears from the matrices and coverings, wherein the noble gems and noble metals are concealed and guarded. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #389 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>389. Quod Sphaerae procreandi ac tutandi procreata, seu Sphaerae amoris conjugialis et amoris infantum, influant in omnia Coeli et in omnia Mundi, a primis ad ultima, est quia cuncta, quae procedunt a Domino, seu a Sole qui ab Ipso est, et in quo Ipse, transeunt Universum creatum usque ad omnium ultima ejus; causa est, quia Divina, quae in progressione vocantur coelestia et spiritualia, sunt spatii et temporis expertia; quod de spiritualibus nulla praedicatio extensi sit, quia nulla spatii et temporis, notum est; inde est, quod quicquid procedit a Domino, in instanti sit a primis in ultimis: quod Sphaera amoris conjugialis ita universalis sit, videatur supra<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_389/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_222" target=_top>222</a> ad 225.</p><p>[2] Quod similiter Sphaera amoris infantum, patet ex illo amore in Coelo, ubi infantes e terris sunt; exque illo amore in Mundo apud homines, apud bestias et aves, serpentes, insecta: hujus amoris analoga etiam dantur in Regnis, Vegetabili et Minerali; in Vegetabili, quod semina custodiantur putaminibus sicut fasciis, ac insuper in fructu sicut in domo, ac nutriantur succo sicut lacte; quod aliquid simile sit in mineris, patet a matricibus et thecis, in quibus nobiles gemmae, et nobilia metalla, reconduntur et custodiuntur. </p>
