<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第81节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>81、就在我们谈论这些事，为此悲伤的时候，一道光突然出现，它如此强烈以至于使我目眩。我举目观看，只见我们上面的整个天堂充满光明；我听见从东到西一长串颂扬神的声音。天使对我说：“这是东、西方天堂的天使因着主的降临而由衷地颂扬祂。”南、北方的天堂只能听见轻柔的呢喃。天使十分清楚这一切，便先告诉我说：“对主的这些颂扬和赞美均取自圣言，因为它们出自主，主就是圣言，也就是说，祂是圣言中的神性真理本身。”他接着说：“在这个特别的时刻，他们正在用先知但以理所说的这些话来颂扬和赞美主：你已看见铁与泥搀杂；它们要通过人的种搀杂，却不能彼此相合。但在那些日子里，天上的神必另立一国，永不败坏，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，这国必存到永远(但以理书2:43，44)。”<br><br>此后，我听见好像唱歌的声音，却在离东方更远的地方看见一道比先前更明亮的光。我问天使，那里是怎么颂扬的。天使说，是以但以理的这些话来颂扬的：<br><br>我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来，得了权柄、国度，各人民、各民族都要拜祂。祂的权柄是永远的权柄，不能废去，祂的国必不败坏。(但以理书7:13，14)<br><br>此外，天使说，他们还以启示录中的这些话赞美主：<br><br>但愿荣耀、权能归给耶稣基督。看哪！祂驾云而来。祂是阿拉法，是俄梅戛，是始，是终，是昔在、今在、以后永在的全能者。我约翰，从七灯台中间的人子听到这一切。(启示录1:5-13; 22:8，13;马太福音24:30，31)<br><br>我再次向东方天堂望去，只见右侧有光渐渐升起，其光亮射向南部穹苍，我还听见甜美的声音。我问天使：“他们在颂扬主的哪一方面？”天使说，是用启示录中的这些话来颂扬的：<br><br>我看见一个新天新地。又看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。有一位天使来同我说话，说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你。我在灵里被那天使带到一座又大又高的山上，他将由神那里从天而降的圣城耶路撒冷指示我。(启示录21:1，2，9，10)<br><br>还有这些话：<br><br>我耶稣是明亮的晨星；圣灵和新妇都说，来！祂说，我必快来！阿们！主耶稣啊，愿你来！(启示录22:16，17，20)<br><br>这一系列和更多颂扬过后，我又听见从东方天堂到西方天堂，以及从南方天堂到北方天堂传来全体的颂扬。我问天使：“这颂扬是怎么进行的？”他说，这些话出自先知书：<br><br>凡有血气的，必都知道我是耶和华你的救主，是你的救赎主。(以赛亚 书49:26)<br><br>耶和华以色列的王，以色列的救赎主，万军之耶和华如此说：我是首先的，是末后的，除我以外再没有真神！(以赛亚书44:6)<br><br>到那日，人必说，看哪，这是我们的神，我们素来等候祂，祂必拯救我们。祂是耶和华，我们素来等候祂。(以赛亚书25:9)<br><br>在旷野，有人声呼喊，当预备耶和华的路。看哪，主耶和华必以大能临到，祂必像牧人牧养自己的羊群。(以赛亚书40:3，5，10，11)<br><br>有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们。祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书9：6）<br><br>看哪，日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；他必掌王权，这是祂的名，耶和华我们的义。(耶利米书23:5，6;33:15，16)<br><br>万军之耶和华是祂的名；救赎你的是以色列的圣者，祂必称为全地之神。(以赛亚书54:5)<br><br>到那日，耶和华必作全地的王；到那日，耶和华必为独一无二的，祂的名也是独一无二的。(撒迦利亚书14:8，9)<br><br>当我听到并明白这一切时，我的心欢喜雀跃，我便高高兴兴地回家了；到家后从灵的状态回到肉体的状态，然后将所见所闻记录下来。对此，需要补充的是：自主降临以来，祂就在复活婚姻之爱，如它在古人中的样子。因为这爱唯独出自主，只存在于那些在祂的引导下通过圣言变得属灵的人当中。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>81、在我们正为此而悲哀的时候，突然有一道刺眼的强光。我抬头一看，整个天空都亮了，我们听到从东向西传来的赞美的歌声。</p><p>天使对我说：“这是对主的到来的赞美。来自于东方和西方天堂的天使们。”（我听到在南面和北面天堂中只是低声的赞美）</p><p>另外，因为 天使了解这一切，他告诉我，首先，赞美及庆祝来自于《圣经》，即来自于主。主是《圣经》中最重要的神圣的真理。</p><p>之后，天使说：“现在，他们用先知和但以礼的话赞美主：</p><p>你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国民世必与各种人搀杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。当那列王在位时候，天上的神必另立一国，永远不败坏。也不救别国的人，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，这国必存到永远（《但以礼书》）</p><p>之后我似乎又听到歌声，在更东方我看到比从前更亮的光，我问天使他们那里在赞美什么。</p><p>天使说他们在用但以礼中的话赞美主：</p><p>我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位象人子的，驾着云而来，被领到亘古常在者面前。得了权柄，荣耀，国度，使各方、各国、各族的人都敬奉着他。他的权柄是永远的，不能废去，他的国必不败坏。（《但以礼书》7:13-14）</p><p>另外，天使说：“他们还用《启示录》中的话赞美主。</p><p>（《启示录》1:5—7，22:13，1:8—13，《马太福音》24:30、31）</p><p>我又看看东方的天空，一道光照向右方，光线射到南部。我听到甜美的歌声，我问天使他们在赞美什么。</p><p>天使说：“他们在用《启示录》21:1。2，9，10及《启示录》22:16，17，20）中的话赞美主。</p><p>我又听到从东到西，从南到北传来赞美声。我问天使：“现在是什么？”</p><p>天使说他们在用以下先知的话赞美主：</p><p>《以赛亚书》49:26；44:6；25:9；40:3；10，11；9:6；54:5</p><p>《耶利米书》23:5，6；33:15，16</p><p>《撒迦利亚书》14:8，9</p><p>听到这些并且知道其中的意义，我的心在激烈地跳动。我愉快地回到家中。又从精神状态回到躯体之中，我记下了所闻所见的一切。另外加一点，主到来后，他将拯救婚姻之爱，使其恢复到象远古时代后那样，婚姻之爱来自于主，存在于那些接受主的话的人们之中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #81 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>81. While this discussion was making us sad, there suddenly appeared a beam of light, so powerful as to dazzle my eyes. So I looked up, and saw the whole heaven above us full of light; and from east to west I heard a long series of voices glorifying God. 'This,' said the angel, 'is the glorifying of the Lord on account of His coming, uttered by the angels of the eastern and western heavens.' Nothing was heard from the southern or northern heavens but a polite murmur.<p>Since the angel understood everything, he told me first that these glorifications and praises of the Lord were taken from the Word, because they then come from the Lord, who is the Word, that is, He is the Divine truth itself in it. 'At this particular moment,' he said, 'they are glorifying and praising the Lord with the words spoken by the prophet Daniel:<p>You have seen iron mixed with common clay; they will mix by means of the seed of man, but will not hold together. But in those days the God of the heavens will cause a kingdom to arise, which will not perish for ever. It will crush and destroy all those kingdoms, but will stand itself for ever.' <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43-44</a>.</p><p>[2] After this I heard what sounded like singing, and yet further away to the east I saw a gleam of light more brilliant than before. I asked the angel what was the glorifying taking place there. He said it was with the words of Daniel:<p>I was watching in the visions of the night, and I saw as it were the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. And to him were given dominion and the kingdom, and all peoples and nations will worship him. His dominion will be a dominion for ever, which will not pass away, and his kingdom one which will not perish. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p>Besides this they praise the Lord using these words from Revelation:<p>To Jesus Christ be glory and strength. Behold, he comes with clouds. He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. I, John, heard this from the Son of Man from the midst of the seven lampstands. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5-13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>, also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>.</p><p>[3] I looked again to the east of heaven and the light was growing from the right; the brightness spread into the expanse of sky to the south, and I heard a sweet sound. I asked the angel, 'What aspect of the Lord are they glorifying there?' He said it was with these words from Revelation:<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth; and I saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride for her husband. And the angel spoke with me and said, Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away in the spirit onto a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city of Jerusalem. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9-10</a>.<p>Also with these words:<p>I, Jesus, am the bright star of the morning; and the spirit and the bride will say, Come. And he said, I am coming soon. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>.</p><p>[4] After this and more, I heard a general glorifying from the east of heaven to the west, and also from the south to the north. I asked the angel what this was. He said it was these words from the Prophets:<p>Let all flesh know that I am Jehovah your Saviour and your Redeemer. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth, I am the first and the last, and there is no God beside me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>.<p>On that day it will be said, Behold, this is our God, whom we have waited for to free us. He is Jehovah, whom we have awaited. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>.<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way for Jehovah. Behold, the Lord Jehovih comes in strength. He will feed his flock like a shepherd. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>.<p>A child is born for us, a son is given to us, whose name is Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p>Behold the days will come when I shall raise up for David a righteous shoot, who will reign as king. And this is his name, Jehovah our righteousness. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>.<p>Jehovah Zebaoth is his name, and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. He will be called the God of the whole earth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>.<p>On that day Jehovah will become king over the whole earth; on that day Jehovah will be one, and his name one. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>.<p>When I heard and understood all this, my heart leaped for joy, and I went home rejoicing; and there I came back from the state of the spirit into that of the body, and in this I wrote down what I had seen and heard. To this I can now add the following. Since the Lord's coming He is reviving conjugial love as it was among the ancient peoples, because that love comes only from the Lord, and is present with those who are under His guidance becoming spiritual by means of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #81 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>81. While we were talking in sorrow about these things, suddenly a burst of light shone about us, dazzling my eyes. I looked up, therefore, and behold, the whole sky above us appeared lit up, and we heard a glorification echoing across it in long succession from the east to the west.<p>Then the angel said to me, "The glorification you hear is a glorification of the Lord on account of His Advent, and it is coming from angels of the eastern and western heavens." (From the southern and northern heavens we heard only a polite murmur.)<p>Moreover, since he understood it all, the angel told me, first, that glorifications and celebrations of the Lord are taken from the Word, because then they come from the Lord, inasmuch as the Lord is the Word, in the sense that He is the essential Divine truth in the Word.<p>Then the angel said, "Specifically now, they are glorifying and celebrating the Lord with these words which were spoken by the prophet Daniel:<p>You saw iron mixed with miry clay; they will mingle together through the seed of man, but they will not cohere.... But (in those days) the God of heaven will make to rise a kingdom which for ages shall not perish...; it shall crush and consume all these kingdoms, while it shall stand for ages. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43-44</a>)"</p><p>[2] After this I heard what seemed to be the sound of singing, and deeper in the east I saw a burst of light more brilliant than the first. And I asked the angel what they were glorifying there.<p>The angel said that they were glorifying the Lord with these words in Daniel:<p>I was seeing in the visions of night, and behold, with the clouds of heaven, was One like the Son of man.... And to Him was given dominion...and a kingdom, and all peoples and nations...shall worship Him. His dominion is the dominion of an age, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom one which shall not perish. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>)<p>In addition, the angel said, they are celebrating the Lord with these phrases taken from the book of Revelation:<p>To (Jesus Christ) be glory and might.... Behold, He is coming with clouds.... (He is) the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last..., who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. I, John...heard...(this from the Son of Man from out of) the midst of the seven lampstands.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5-7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_8.htm">1:8-13</a>; taken also from <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>)</p><p>[3] I looked again into the eastern sky, and a light shone over to the right, whose glow extended into the southern hemisphere. Hearing as well a sweet sound, I asked the angel what aspect of the Lord they were glorifying there.<p>The angel said they were quoting these words in the book of Revelation:<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth.... And I...saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride...for her husband.... And (an angel) talked with me and said, "Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife." And he carried me away in the spirit on to a great and high mountain, and showed me the...city, the holy Jerusalem.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9-10</a>)<p>Also these words:<p>I, Jesus...am...the Bright and Morning Star. And the Spirit and the bride shall say, "Come!".... (And He said,) "I also am coming quickly." Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus! (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>)</p><p>[4] After these and other things, we heard a general glorification echoing across the sky from the east to the west and also from the south to the north, and I asked the angel, "What is happening now?"<p>He said they were quoting these verses from the Prophets:<p>Let all flesh know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>)<p>Thus said Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts: "I am the First and the Last, and beside Me there is no God." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>)<p>It will be said in that day: "Behold, this is our God, whom we have waited for to free us. This is Jehovah, whom we have waited for." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>)<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Prepare the way of Jehovah...." ...Behold, the Lord Jehovih comes in strength.... He will feed His flock like a shepherd. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>)<p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given..., whose name shall be...Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)<p>Behold, the days will come..., and I will raise to David a righteous Branch, who shall reign, a King.... And this is His name...: JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>)<p>Jehovah of Hosts is His name, and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. He shall be called God of the whole earth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>)<p>In that day...Jehovah shall become King over all the earth. In that day there will be one Jehovah and His name will be one. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">Zechariah 14:8-9</a>)</p><p>[5] When I heard these things and understood their meaning, as a result my heart leapt, and I went home filled with joy. And there, returning from the state of my spirit into a bodily state, I wrote down what I had seen and heard. To which I now add this, that following His Advent the Lord will revive conjugial love, such as it was among ancient peoples. For conjugial love comes only from the Lord, and it is found in people who are made spiritual by Him through His Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #81 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>81. As we talked and grieved about these things, the light suddenly shone brighter, narrowing my eyes, so I looked up and saw the whole sky above us seem to glow, and the word glorification resounded from east to west.<p>The angel said to me, "That glorification is a celebration of the Lord for His Advent. Angels of heaven from the east and west are doing it."<p>From the southern and northern heaven we heard nothing but a gentle murmur.<p>The angel understood all this, so first he said to me that glorifications and celebrations of the Lord come from the Word, because then they come from the Lord, since the Lord is the Word - that is, the Divine Truth itself in the Word. And he said, "Now they are particularly glorifying and celebrating the Lord through these words that Daniel the prophet said:<p>You saw the iron mixed with clay. They will mingle themselves through human seed but will not hold together. But in those days the God of the heavens will make a kingdom arise that will not perish through the ages. That kingdom will break and consume everything, though it will stand for ages itself. (Dan. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_43.htm">2:43-44</a>)<p>After this I heard something like singing, and deeper in the east I saw a flash of light brighter than the first, and I asked the angel what that one glorified.<p>He said, "The Lord, in these words from Daniel:<p>I saw in a night vision, and in the clouds of heaven it was as if the Son of Man was coming! And dominion and the Kingdom is given to Him, and all people and races worship Him - His dominion is the dominion of ages, which will not go away, and His kingdom will not perish. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_14.htm">14</a>)<p>"They are also celebrating the Lord by these words in the Book of Revelation:<p>Glory and strength to Jesus Christ. See him come with clouds.<p>He himself is Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End, First and Last, Who is and Who will be, all - powerful. I, John, heard this from the Son of Man from among the seven candlestands. (Rev.<p><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_5.htm">1:5-13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>)<p>Again I looked into the eastern sky. It was light to the right side, and the brightness reached the southern area, and I heard a sweet sound. I asked the angel, "What are they celebrating about the Lord there?"<p>He said it was these words in Revelation:<p>I saw a new sky and a new earth, and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a wife for her husband. And an angel spoke with me and said, "Come. I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife." And he carried me away spiritually over a large, high mountain and showed me the city Holy Jerusalem.

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>)<p>Jehovah, King of Israel, and your Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth, says this: I am First and Last, and there is no God other than 1.

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #81 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>81. As we were talking about these things, and grieving, suddenly there appeared a stream of light powerfully affecting my eyes. I therefore looked up, and lo, the whole heaven above us appeared luminous, and from east to west in a long series was heard therefrom a glorification. The angel then said to me, "That glorification is a glorification of the Lord, which is being made by angels of the eastern and western heavens on account of His advent." From the southern and northern heavens only a gentle murmur was heard.<p>Because the angel understood all this, he told me, first that glorifications and celebrations of the Lord are made from the Word because then they are made from the Lord, He being the Word, that is, the Divine Truth therein. He then added: "Now, in particular, they are glorifying and celebrating the Lord by these words spoken by Daniel the prophet:<p>Thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves through the seed of man, but they shall not cohere. But in those days, the God of the heavens shall make to arise a kingdom which shall not be destroyed for ages. It shall break in pieces and consume all those kingdoms; but itself shall stand for ages." <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43, 44</a>.</p><p>[2] After this I heard, as it were, the sound of a song, and more deeply in the east, I saw that the sparkling of the light was more brilliant than before; so I asked the angel, "By what are they glorifying there." He said: "By these words in Daniel:<p>I was seeing in the visions of the night, and behold, with the clouds of heaven, one coming like unto the SON OF MAN; and unto Him was given dominion and a kingdom, and all peoples and nations shall worship Him. His dominion is the dominion of an age which shall not pass away, and His kingdom which shall not perish. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>.<p>In addition to the above, they are celebrating the Lord from these words in the Apocalypse:<p>To JESUS CHRIST be glory and strength. Behold, He cometh with clouds. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.

He said: "These words in the Apocalypse:<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth. And I saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as A BRIDE [ADORNED] FOR HER HUSBAND. And the angel spake with me and said, Come hither, I will show thee THE BRIDE, THE LAMB'S WIFE.
