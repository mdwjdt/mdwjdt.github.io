<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第129节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>129、⑽教会来自主，就在靠近祂并照祂诫命生活的人当中。如今，没有人否认，教会是主的，因是主的，故来自主。教会就在那些靠近主的人当中，这是因为，在基督教界，主的教会建立在圣言的基础上；圣言不仅来自主，而且还以它就是主的方式来自祂。在圣言中，神性真理与神性良善结合，这也是主。这正是“道（圣言）与神同在，道就是神，是人生命的源头和光，道成了肉身”（约翰福音1:1-14）的意思。此外，教会在那些靠近主的人当中，这是因为它在那些信祂的人当中；这信就是：祂就是神，救主和救赎主，耶和华我们的义，是进入羊圈，即教会必经之门；祂就是道路、真理和生命；若不藉着祂，没有人能到父那里去；父与祂为一；以及祂亲自所教导的其它事。我再重申一次，若不靠近主，没有人能信这些事，因为就像祂所教导的，祂是天地之神。还有谁当被靠近？还有谁能被靠近？祂与那些照其诫命生活的人同在，因为结合只在这类人身上才有可能。祂说:<br><br>有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的，我也要爱他，与他同住。不爱我的人，就不遵守我的道。（约翰福音14:21-24）<br><br>爱就是结合，与主结合构成教会。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>129、（10）教会来自于主，并且它存在于那些走近主并按主的戒律生活的人们中。没有人否认教会是主的教会，它来自于主。</p><p>教会存在于走进主的人中，因为基督教会建立在《圣经》之上，《圣经》来自于主，是主的体现。《圣经》中有神圣真理及其与善的结合，这也就是主。这就是（《约翰福音》1:1—14）中说的这就是神，人从此获得生命及光，变成肉身。</p><p>另外，教会存在于走进主并相信主的人中。主是神，是救世主。人要进入教会，人要通过主才能走进父神，父神与主是一体，还有许多主所教导的东西，这一切只有走进主的人才会相信，主是世间及天国的神，主就是他所教导的一切，人除了主还会走向哪里呢？</p><p>教会存在于按主的戒律生活的人中。因为主的戒律与主相连，因为主说过：</p><p>有了我的命令又遵守的人，这人就是爱我的……我也要爱他……不爱我的人，就不遵守我的道……（《约翰福音》14:21-24）</p><p>爱起到连接作用，教会就是与主的连接所在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #129 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>129. (x) The church is from the Lord, and is present with those who approach Him and live in accordance with His commandments.<p>No one nowadays denies that the church is the Lord's, and being the Lord's that it comes from Him. The reason the church exists with those who approach the Lord is that in the Christian world His church is based on the Word; and the Word is not only from the Lord, but is so in such a way that it is the Lord. In it Divine truth is combined with Divine good, and this too is the Lord. This is precisely what is meant by the Word being with God, and being God, the source of life and light to men, and becoming flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>). Furthermore its presence with those who approach the Lord is because it is present with those who believe in Him, believing that He is God the Saviour and Redeemer, Jehovah our righteousness, the gate by which the sheepfold, that is, the church, must be entered; that He is the way, truth and life; that no one comes to the Father except through Him; the Father and He are one; and many more things He teaches. No one, I repeat, can believe these things without approaching Him, since He is the God of heaven and earth, as He also teaches. Ought anyone else to be approached? and can anyone else be approached? His presence with those who live in accordance with His commandments is because linking is only possible with such people. For he says:<p>He who keeps my commandments and does them, he it is who loves me; and I will love him and make my dwelling with him. He, however, who does not love me does not keep my commandments. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>.<p>Love is linking, and linking with the Lord makes the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #129 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>129. 10. The church comes from the Lord and it exists in people who go to Him and live according to His commandments. No one at the present day denies that the church is the Lord's, and that because it is the Lord's, it is from the Lord.<p>It exists in people who go to Him, because the Lord's church in the Christian world is founded on the Word, and the Word is from Him and from Him in such a way that it is Him. The Word contains Divine truth united to Divine good, and this also is the Lord. This is precisely what is meant by the Word which was with God and which was God, from which men have life and light, and which became flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>).<p>Moreover, the church exists in people who go to the Lord for the further reason that it exists in those who believe in Him. And no one can believe that He is God the Savior and Redeemer, Jehovah who is Righteousness, <sup >1</sup>the door by which one must enter the sheepfold (that is to say, the church), <sup >2</sup>the way, the truth and the life, that no one comes to the Father except through Him, <sup >3</sup>that the Father and He are one, <sup >4</sup>besides many other things that the Lord Himself teaches - no one, I say, can believe these things unless he gets his belief from the Lord. No one can believe these things without going to the Lord, because He is God of heaven and earth, as He Himself also teaches. <sup >5</sup>Who else should one go to? Who else can one go to?<p>The church exists in people who live according to the Lord's commandments, because they alone have conjunction with Him. For the Lord says:<p>He who has My commandments and obeys them, it is he who loves Me....and I will love him....and (I will) make an abode with him. (But) he who does not love Me does not keep My (commandments).... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>)<p>Love is what conjoins, and conjunction with the Lord is the church.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-corinthians_1_30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_7.htm">7</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>.<p>4.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_11.htm">17:11</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">22</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_19.htm">8:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_45.htm">12:45</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">14:7-9</a>.<p>5.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #129 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>129. 10. The church is from the Lord and is within those who approach Him and live by His teachings. Today people do not deny that the church is the Lord's and that since it is the Lord's it is from the Lord.<p>The reason why the church is among those who approach Him is that His church in the Christian world is from the Word, and the Word is from Him - from Him in such a way that it is He.<p>It has Divine Truth united with Divine Good in it, and this, too, is the Lord. This is exactly the meaning of the Word that "was with God and was God," from which is the life and light of men, and which "was made flesh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>).<p>Moreover, it is with those who approach Him because it is with those who believe in Him - that He is God, Savior, Redeemer, Jehovah Justice, the Door where you enter the Sheepfold (i.e., the church), the Way, the Truth, and Life; that no one comes to the Father except through Him; that He and the Father are one; and the other things that He teaches. I tell you, no one can believe these things unless it is of His doing.<p>The church can be with only those who approach Him because He is God of heaven and earth, as He also teaches. Whom else would you approach, and who else could be approached? The church can be only with those who live according to His instructions because for others the connection is not there, for He says:<p>Whoever keeps My commandments and does them, he is the one who loves Me, and I will love him and make My home with him. But surely whoever does not love Me does not keep My commandments. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>)<p>Love is joining together, and joining with the Lord is a church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #129 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>129. X. THAT THE CHURCH IS FROM THE LORD AND IS WITH THOSE WHO APPROACH HIM AND LIVE ACCORDING TO HIS COMMANDMENTS. It is not denied at this day that the Church is the Lord's, and, being the Lord's, that it is from the Lord. That it is with those who approach Him, is because in the Christian world His Church is from the Word, and the Word is from Him, being from Him in such wise that it is Himself. In the Word is Divine Truth united with Divine Good, and this also is the Lord. Nothing else is meant by the Word which was with God and which was God, from which men have life and light, and which was made flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>). Furthermore, that the Church is with those who approach Him, is because it is with those who believe in Him; and the belief that He is God, the Savior and Redeemer, Jehovah our Justice, the Door by which to enter into the sheepfold--that is, into the Church--the Way the Truth and the Life, that no one comes to the Father but by Him, that the Father and He are one, and much else which He Himself teaches, this belief, I say, is possible to no one except from Him. That it is not possible unless He is approached, is because He is the God of heaven and earth, as He also teaches. Who else is to be approached? and who else can be approached? That He is with those who live according to His commandments, is because with others there is no conjunction; for He says:<p>He that hath my commandments, and doeth them, he it is that loveth me, and I will love him and will make my abode with him. But he that loveth me not keepeth not my commandment. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>.<p>Love is conjunction; and conjunction with the Lord is the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #129 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>129. (x) The Church is from the Lord and with those who approach Him and live according to His commandments. It is not denied at this day that the Church is the Lord's, and being His, is from Him. It exists with those who approach Him, because in Christendom His Church is from the Word, which is from Him and in such wise as to be Himself. In the Word Divine Truth and Divine Good are united, and these are also the Lord. Nothing less is meant by the Word<p>Which was with God, and which was God, from which is the life and light of men, and which was made flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>).<p>Again, the Church is with those who approach the Lord, because it is with those who believe in Him. To believe that He is God the Savior and Redeemer, Jehovah our Righteousness, the Door by which one enters the sheepfold or the Church, and that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; that no one comes to the Father except by Him; that the Father and He are one, besides much else which He teaches - these things, I say, no one can believe except from Him. One cannot believe them unless the Lord is approached, for the reason that He is God of heaven and earth, as He also teaches. Who else is there to approach? And who else can be approached? Finally, the Church is with those who live according to His commandments, for the reason that only with these is conjunction effected. For he says,<p>He who has My commandments and does them, he it is that loves Me, ... and I will love him ... and will make My abode with him ... but he who loves Me not, does not keep My commandments (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>).<p>Love is conjunction, and conjunction with the Lord is the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #129 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>129. (10) That the Church is from the Lord, and is with those who come to Him and live according to His commandments. It is not denied at this day that the church is the Lord's, and because it is the Lord's that it is from the Lord. It is with those who come to Him, because His church in the Christian world is from the Word, and the Word is from Him, yea, from Him in such wise that it is Himself. Therein is the Divine Truth united with the Divine Good, and this also is the Lord. Nothing else is meant in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>, by the Word 'which was with God, and which was God, from which is the life and the light of men, and which was made flesh.' And further, it is with those who come to Him because it is with them that believe in Him; and no one can believe that He is God, the Saviour and Redeemer; Jehovah the Justice; the Door by which to enter into the sheepfold, that is, into the church; the Way, the Truth, and the Life; that no one. cometh to the Father but by Him; that He and the Father are one; and many more things which He Himself teaches; these things, I say, no man can believe except from Him. That it cannot be unless He is approached, is because He is the God of heaven and earth, as He also teaches. Who else should be approached? Who else can be approached? It is with those who live according to His commandments, because with others there is no conjunction; for He says: -<p>He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him, and will make My abode with him. But he that loveth Me not doth not keep My commandments (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>).<p>Love is conjunction; and conjunction with the Lord is the church. </p>
