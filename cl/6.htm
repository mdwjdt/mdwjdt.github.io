<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第6节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>6、此后，天使转向持以下观点者：天上喜乐和永恒幸福就是和亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各同坐席，然后就游戏和娱乐，接着又是盛宴，如此反复，直到永远。天使对他们说：“跟我来，我必带你们享受你们的快乐所赋予的幸福。”于是，天使领他们穿过一片小树林，来到一块铺有木板的空地上，那里已摆好桌子，两边各有十五张。他们奇道：“为何摆这么多桌子？”天使回答说：“第一张桌子是亚伯拉罕的，第二张是以撒的，第三张是雅各的，其它的依次是十二使徒的。对面的十五张是他们妻子的，头三张是给亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉，以撒的妻子利百加，雅各的妻子利亚与拉结的，剩下的十二张是给十二使徒妻子的。”<br><br>过了一会儿，只见桌子上摆满菜肴，空档处还点缀了糖果小金字塔。就餐者站在桌子周围，等候东道主列席。过了不多时，就看见他们鱼贯而入，亚伯拉罕领头，使徒们在最后。接着他们各就各位，坐在首席旁边长凳的一头，然后对周围站着的人说：“你们也和我们一同入座吧。”于是，男人们便和族长同坐，女人们则和族长妻子们同坐。他们开怀畅饮，尽情吃喝。宴后，族长们便离开，然后游戏开始了，少男少女们翩翩起舞，之后是戏剧表演。这些活动结束后，他们又受邀赴宴，但规则是，第一天他们要和亚伯拉罕一同进餐，第二天和以撒，第三天和雅各（Jacob），第四天和彼得，第五天和雅各（James），第六天和约翰，第七天和保罗，依次类推，直到第十五天，然后再按同样的顺序重新赴宴，仅仅改变地方，如此直到永远。<br><br>之后，天使将这组人召集起来，对他们说：“你们看到的这些坐席者，对天上喜乐和永恒幸福的想法和你们差不多。为让他们亲眼看到自己所想的何等虚妄，以便抛弃它们，经主允许，这些盛宴和表演得以举行。你们所看到坐首席的这些为首者，都是扮演老人的演员，他们当中有许多留着胡子的乡下人，因有点小财便目中无人，幻想自己是古时的族长。不过，请随我离开这个活动场所。”<br><br>于是，他们一路跟随，发现这里五十个人，那里五十个人。这些人都吃得撑肠拄腹，直到恶心，此时，都渴望回到家乡的熟悉环境。有的渴望回去履行工作职责，有的渴望回去做生意，有的渴望回去工作。但许多人被林中的守卫扣留，被问及还得欢宴几天，是不是要和彼得、保罗同坐席。守卫对他们说，还没有进行完就离开是他们的耻辱，因为这样做很不体面。但绝大多数人回答说：“我们受够了自己的快乐，对我们来说，食物味同嚼腊，我们的味觉也枯竭了，一看到这些食物就反胃，再也咽不下去。我们在这花天酒地中已挣扎了数个日日夜夜，现在只恳求你放我们出去。”一得到许可，他们就上气不接下气地飞奔回家。<br><br>然后，天使将这组人召集起来，在路上教导他们有关天堂的事，内容如下：“天堂和尘世一样，也有吃有喝，盛宴和聚会。为首者享受筵席，席上摆满珍馐美味，从而使他们的灵振作，有活力。也有游戏和表演，还有音乐会和演唱会，而且这一切都是最完美的。这类事对天使来说的确是欢乐，但不是幸福。幸福必有欢乐在其中，因而出于欢乐。正是欢乐中的幸福使得欢乐成为欢乐，充实并保持它们，以免欢乐变得一文不值，索然无味。人人都是通过在工作中提供服务获得这种幸福的。<br><br>“所有天使的意愿情感中都潜藏着某种倾向，它吸引天使的心智去做事，心智以此令自己平静和满足。这种平静和满足的感觉会使心智乐于从主接受对服务的爱。天上的幸福是接受这爱的果效，这才是赋予生命欢乐（如前所述）之物。天堂的食物本质上无非是爱、智慧，以及二者结合在一起的功用或服务，也就是出于爱藉着智慧所提供的功用或服务。因此，在天上，每个人为身体所得的食物，取决于他所提供的功用或服务。服务最优质，食物最精致；服务中等，食物中等，不过也很美味；服务低劣，食物就低劣。不过，懒人则没有食物。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>6、（1）这之后，天使开始与那些认为天国之乐就是与亚伯拉罕,以撒,雅各共尽晚餐的人讲话。天使说：“跟我来，我带你们到你们的快乐之中”，天使带他们走过树丛来到平坦的木地板上，那里摆着桌子，一边十五张桌，另一边十五张桌。</p><p>他们问道：“为什么这么多桌子？”</p><p>天使回答说：“第一张桌是亚伯拉罕的，第二张桌是以撒的，第三张桌是雅各的，其它的依次是十二使徒的。” “在另一边是他们妻子的桌子。前三张桌是亚伯拉罕的妻子沙拉，以撒的妻子瑞拜卡的和雅各的妻子利雅和瑞秋的。剩下的十二张桌是十二使徒的妻子们的。”</p><p>（2）过了一段时间后，桌上摆满成盘的食品，盘子间放着塔状的容器，里面装着调料。客人们在桌子周围站着等着主人的到来。和使徒依次进来走到各自的桌前在桌子的一头坐下。然后，他们对周围站着的人说“与我们一起坐吧。”男人们与长老们坐在一起，女人们与他们的妻子坐在一起。他们带着敬意，一起高兴地用餐。</p><p>饭后，长老们离开了，之后活动开始了——青年男女跳着舞，随后是展览。在这些结束以后，客人们再次被邀请用餐。但是有这样原规定，在此第一天的人与亚伯拉罕一起进餐，第二天的们与以撒一起，第三天的人与雅各一起，第四天的人与彼得一起，第五天的人与詹姆斯一起，第六天的人与约翰一起，第七天的人与保罗在一起，依次直到第十五天的人，之后他们会换座位，开始新一轮宴会，这样直到永远。</p><p>（3）此时，天使召集人们说：“你们看到的这些人与你们有相同的对天国之乐的想像。为了让他们看到这种想法有多么愚蠢，并让他们放弃这种想法，这种宴席被主所允许。餐桌边的长者是扮演老人的人演的，大多数都是年轻的人，他们留长了胡子，因他们拥有的财富而比其它人看上去高贵。他们也假想着自己是长老。”</p><p>“跟我们来。”</p><p>（4）于是他们跟着，他们看到这边有十五个人，那边有十五个人，他们吃得大多以致于感到恶心。这些人渴望回到自己的家中，一些回到公职中，一些人回到商务中，一些人回到受雇的职位中。但一些人被看守树丛的人留住，向他们询问他们赴宴的日子。问他们是否与彼得及保罗一起用了餐。他告诉我们，若他们在这之前离开，是不妥的，因为这样不礼貌。</p><p>但是，他们的大多数都说：“我们已经享受了足够的快乐了。这的食物已变得无味，我们的味觉已经干涸了。我们的胃肠感到恶心，我们不能忍受再多吃一点了。我们已经这样游荡了数天，现在迫不急待地想解脱。</p><p>得到解脱后，他们喘吸着急匆匆地回到家中。</p><p>（5）以后，天使召集集会的人们，向他们解释了关于天堂以下的情节：</p><p>“在天堂中，人们有像在世间时一样的食物。也有欢乐的聚餐宴会，好的市民家中有丰盛的食物，这些美味使他们精神愉悦。他们也有展览，演出和音乐会，一切都是极其完美的。他们认为这些是快乐，但却不是幸福。幸福处于快乐之中，来自于快乐。幸福处于快乐之中，使得快乐成为快乐。幸福使快乐完善并使它不会变得枯燥。每个人都能从在自己的岗位上尽职尽责中得到幸福。</p><p>（6）每个天使的意向中都潜藏着一种趋向，使得它们想要完成一些事情。完成要完成的事情后，天使会感到平静和满足。这种满足和平静使思想处于一种状态，它能接受来自于主的服务于人，有益于人的爱。接受这种爱能产生一种幸福，这是刚提到的快乐的生命之所在。</p><p>“天国的食物从其实质上说就是爱，智慧和有益于人的结合，也就是通过爱而服务于人。继而，在天国中，每个人都根据他的表现而得到食物——服务优异的人得到丰盛的食物，服务中等的人得到简朴但美味的食物，服务一般的人得到简陋的食物，懒惰的人什么也得不到。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #6 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>6. After this the angel addressed those who had formed the notion that the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness meant feasting with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and after the feast games and entertainments, followed by more feasts, and so on for ever. 'Follow me,' he told them, 'and I shall bring you to the enjoyment of the happiness your joys give.' So he led them through a wood to a clearing paved with planks, where tables were set out, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other.<p>'Why are there so many tables?' they asked. The angel replied that the first table was Abraham's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's, and then ranged next to these the tables of the twelve Apostles. On the other side were the same number of tables for their wives, the first three for Sarah, the wife of Abraham, Rebecca, the wife of Isaac, and Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives. The other twelve were for the wives of the twelve Apostles.</p><p>[2] After a little while all the tables appeared full of dishes of food, and the small spaces between them were decorated with small pyramids of sweets. The diners stood around the tables waiting to see the people who would preside; and after a short interval these were seen entering in procession with Abraham at their head and the rear brought up by the last of the Apostles. Then each went to his own table and sat down on the couch at its head, from where they invited those standing around: 'Will you too please take your seats with us.' So the men sat at table with the patriarchs, and the women with their wives, and they ate and drank cheerfully and with reverence. After the lunch the patriarchs went out, and then the games began, dancing by young girls and young men, and then theatrical performances. When these were over, they were invited to feast again, but the rule was that the first day they should dine with Abraham, the second with Isaac, the third with Jacob, the fourth with Peter, the fifth with James, the sixth with John, the seventh with Paul, and so on with the rest up to the fifteenth day, after which they would go through all the feasts again, merely changing places, and so on for ever.</p><p>[3] After this the angel called together the men in the group and said to them: 'All these whom you have seen at table had much the same thoughts as you did, when they imagined the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness. In order that they should see for themselves how vain their notions were, these feasts and performances were set up with the Lord's permission. The leading figures you saw at the head of each table were old men portrayed by actors, many of them countryfolk who had beards, and as the result of some degree of wealth more haughty than the rest; these were made to imagine that they were the ancient patriarchs. But follow me to the exits from this exercise-ground.'</p><p>[4] So they followed him and came upon fifty people in one place and fifty more in another, who had stuffed their bellies with food until they felt sick. Then they longed to return to the familiar surroundings of their homes, some to their duties, some to their businesses, and some to their work. But many of them were stopped by the guards of the wood, and questioned about the days they had spent feasting, and whether they had yet eaten at the tables of Peter and Paul, telling them that if they left before this, it would make them ashamed to be so impolite. But most of them answered: 'We have had enough of our joys. The food has become tasteless to us, our throats have become parched, so that our stomachs loathe food and we can no longer bear to swallow it. We have spent a number of long days and nights amid that luxury; we beg you earnestly to let us go.' When they were allowed out, they hurried off home so fast they were out of breath.</p><p>[5] After this the angel called the men of the group together, and as they walked gave them the following information about heaven: 'In heaven, just as in the world, there is food and drink, and there are banquets and parties. The leading people there have their tables laden with rich feasts, dainties and delicacies, which serve to cheer and refresh their minds. There are also games and theatrical performances; there are also concerts and singing, and all achieve the highest perfection. Such things are a joy to them, but they do not constitute happiness. Happiness has to have joys and therefore comes from joys. It is the happiness in joys that makes them joys, enriches them, and keeps them from becoming worthless and boring. Everyone gets this happiness by being of service in his occupation.</p><p>[6] 'Every angel has some hidden tendency in the affection of his will, which induces his mind to do something. By this means the mind calms and satisfies itself. This feeling of satisfaction and calm render the state of the mind amenable to receiving from the Lord the love of service. Heavenly happiness is the result of receiving this, and this is what gives life to the joys I mentioned before. Heavenly food is essentially nothing but love, wisdom and service all combined; that is, service performed by means of wisdom out of love. Everyone therefore in heaven gets food for the body depending on the service he performs; it is magnificent for those who perform the highest services, moderate but of exquisite flavour for those whose service is modest, humble for those who perform humble services. But there is none at all for the lazy.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #6 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>6. After this the angel spoke to the ones who had instilled in themselves the idea that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness would be dinners with Abram, Isaac and Jacob, <sup >1</sup>followed by exhibitions and shows and more dining, and so on to eternity. And the angel said to them, "Follow me and I will introduce you to the felicities of your joys." He then led them through a grove of trees to a level clearing overlaid with wooden boards on which stood tables, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other.<p>And they asked, "Why so many tables?"<p>The angel answered that the first table was Abram's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's, and the tables after these, in order, the tables of the twelve apostles. "And on the other side," he said, "are again as many tables belonging to their wives. The first three are the tables of Sarah, Abram's wife, of Rebekah, Isaac's wife, and of Leah and Rachel, the wives of Jacob. The remaining twelve are the tables of the wives of the twelve apostles."</p><p>[2] After some delay the tables all appeared filled with plates of food, with the spaces between them decorated with little pyramidal vessels containing condiments. Dinner guests were standing around the tables awaiting the appearance of the hosts of the tables. Following a short wait, the hosts appeared, entering in order of procession from Abram to the last of the apostles. And presently, going over to their tables, they each took a place on the couch at the head of the table. Then they said to the people standing about, "Recline here with us also." And the men reclined with the patriarchs and the women with the patriarchs' wives, and they ate and they drank in gladness and with veneration.<p>After the meal the patriarchs departed, and then the exhibitions began - the dances of young men and women, and afterwards shows.<p>When these came to an end, the guests were again invited to dine, but with the stipulation that those who on the first day ate with Abram, on the second would dine with Isaac, on the third with Jacob, on the fourth with Peter, on the fifth with James, on the sixth with John, on the seventh with Paul, and so on with the rest in order until the fifteenth day, whereupon they would change seats and begin the dinner parties again in the same sequence, and so on to eternity.</p><p>[3] At this point the angel called together the men of the company and said to them, "All these people that you saw at the tables had the same imaginary idea of the joys of heaven and consequent eternal happiness that you did. So in order that they may see the foolishness of their ideas and be weaned from them, dinner scenes like this have been instituted and have been permitted by the Lord. The leaders you saw at the heads of the tables were actors playing old men, most of them from a backward people, who let their beards grow and developed a haughtiness over the rest on account of their possessing a certain wealth. A fantasy has been produced them that they are those patriarchs.<p>"But follow me to the paths leading out of this arena."</p><p>[4] So they followed, and they saw fifty people here and fifty there, people who had stuffed their bellies with food to the point of nausea, and who longed to return to the familiar settings of their homes, some to their professional duties, some to their businesses, and some to their employments. But the guards of the grove detained many of them and interrogated them about the days of their dining, as to whether they had eaten yet at the tables of Peter and Paul, telling them that if they were leaving before doing so, it would be to their disgrace, because it was impolite.<p>But most of them answered, "We have had enough of our joys. The food has become tasteless to us and our ability to taste has run dry. Our stomachs are sick of food. We cannot bear to taste it. Having dragged out several days and nights in this dissipation, we earnestly beg to be released."<p>And being released, with panting breath and hurried step they fled away home.</p><p>[5] Afterwards the angel called the men of the company and on the way explained to them the following things about heaven:<p>"In heaven they have food and drink just as in the world, also dinner parties and festive meals. And in the homes of the leading citizens there they have tables set with rich, choice and exquisite foods, which enliven and refresh their spirits. They also have exhibitions and shows, and instrumental and vocal musical performances, all in the highest perfection. Such things, too, they regard as joys, but not as happiness. Happiness must be in the joys in order to come from the joys. Happiness in the joys causes the joys to be joys. It enriches them and sustains them so that they do not become common and loathsome. This happiness everyone has from being useful in his occupation.</p><p>[6] "Latent in the affection of every angel's will is a certain inner tendency which draws the mind to accomplish something. By accomplishment the mind finds peace and satisfaction. This satisfaction and peace produce a state of mind receptive of a love of useful service from the Lord. From the reception of this love comes heavenly happiness, which is the life in the joys just referred to.<p>"Heavenly food in its essence is nothing else than love, wisdom and useful service combined, that is, useful service accomplished through wisdom out of love. Consequently in heaven everyone is given food for the body in accordance with the useful service he performs - magnificent food in the case of those engaged in outstanding service, modest food but of excellent flavor and taste in the case of those in an intermediate degree of useful service, and humble food in the case of those in humble service, while the lazy receive none."<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #6 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>6. After that the angel spoke to the ones who had decided that for them heavenly joys and eternal happiness would be feasts with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and after the feasts shows and games, and then more feasts, and so on to eternity.<p>"Follow me," he said, "and I will lead you into the pleasures of your joys." And he led them through a grove to a level place with a floor, which had tables placed on it - fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other.<p>"Why so many tables?" they asked.<p>"The first table is Abraham's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's," said the angel, "and next to them are lined up the tables of the twelve Apostles. On the other side is the same number of tables, for their wives. The first three tables are for Sarah, Abraham's wife; Rebecca, Isaac's wife; and Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives. The other twelve are for the twelve Apostles' wives."<p>After a while, we saw all the tables loaded with platters placed between little ornamental pyramids of delicacies. The guests stood around them waiting to see the heads of the tables. In a while they arrived as expected, filing in, from Abraham to the last Apostle. Soon each approached his own table and settled onto a couch at the head of it. And then they told the standing group, "Settle back like us."<p>They did - the men with the Fathers and the women with their wives - and ate and drank in happiness, and with reverence.<p>After dinner the Fathers went away, and then began the sports, the dances of young women and men, and after them the performances.<p>When it was over, they were invited to feast again. It was set up so that the first day one ate with Abraham, the next with Isaac, the third with Jacob, the fourth with Peter, the fifth with James, the sixth with John, the seventh with Paul, and with the rest in order until the fifteenth day, when the feasting would start over again in the same order, and so on to eternity.<p>After this the angel called together the men in the group and told them, "All the people you saw at the tables had the same unreal concept as you about the joys of heaven and the eternal happiness one gains from those joys. To let them see how unreal their ideas were and to lead them away from those notions, mock revelries like that were provided and permitted by the Lord.<p>"Those leaders you saw at the heads of the tables were aged impersonators - mostly unsophisticated - who were prouder than others because they had beards and some wealth, which induced the fantasy that they were the ancient Fathers.<p>"But follow me. I'll show you the way out of this training room."<p>They followed and saw fifty people here and fifty there who had stuffed their bellies with food to the point of nausea and badly wanted to return to familiar home surroundings - some to their duties, some to their businesses, and some to their work. But the attendants in the grove detained many of them and asked about their days of feasting, and whether they had eaten at the table with Peter and Paul yet, saying that if they were leaving before they did so, it would be improper and shameful.<p>But most of them answered, "We are stuffed full with our joys. Food has lost its flavor for us. Our pleasure in it has burned out. Our stomachs loathe it. We can't bear to taste it. We have dragged ourselves through several days and nights of this indulgence, and we earnestly beg to be let out." And when they were turned loose they fled home, gasping for breath, at a dead run.<p>After these events the angel called together the men in the group, and on the way he taught them these things about heaven:<p>"There is food and drink in heaven just as in the world. There are parties and feasts. And for the leaders there, there are tables with splendid meals on them, delicacies and luxuries, which exhilarate and refresh their spirits. And there are also games and performances, and musicals and sings - all in the highest perfection.<p>These things are delightful for them, too, but they are not happiness.<p>They are within the joys and therefore come from joys. The happiness behind the pleasures makes them pleasant, enriches them, and keeps them from fading and becoming distasteful. And this happiness comes to everyone from the usefulness in what he does. In the dispositions of every angel's will there is a natural bent that attracts his mind to something that needs to be done, and it soothes and satisfies his mind. This serenity and satisfaction produce a mental state that can receive from the Lord a love of being useful. From receiving this comes heavenly happiness which is the vital element in those joys that were mentioned before.<p>"Heavenly food in essence is nothing but love, wisdom, and usefulness together! In other words, a use carried on, with wisdom, and springing from love. On account of this, a person in heaven gets food for his body according to the useful things he does - magnificent food for people who are useful on a large scale, plain but very delicious for those engaged in average usefulness, common food for those who do common work, and none for the inactive." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #6 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>6. After this, the angel addressed those who had deluded themselves with the idea that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness consisted in feasting with Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, followed by sports and public shows and then by more feasting, and so on to eternity. To these he said: "Follow me and I will bring you into the felicities of your joys."<p>He then led them through a grove to a level place covered with boards, on which were set tables, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other. And they asked, "Why so many tables?"<p>The angel answered: "The first table is Abram's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's, and next to these in order come the tables of the twelve Apostles. On the other side is the same number of tables for their wives, the first three being those of Sarah the wife of Abram, Rebekah the wife of Isaac, and Leah and Rachel the wives of Jacob; the twelve others are for the wives of the twelve Apostles."</p><p>[2] After some delay, all the tables were seen to be laden with dishes of food, the little spaces between them being embellished with small pyramids containing sweetmeats. The guests stood around the tables, awaiting their respective hosts. These were shortly seen to enter, in order of precedence from Abram to the last of the Apostles; and presently each approached his own table and reclined upon a couch at its head. They then said to those who stood around, "Recline ye also with us"' and they did so, the men with the patriarchs and the women with their wives; and they ate and drank in gladness and with veneration.<p>After the feast the patriarchs retired, and then began sports, dances of maidens and young men, and after these, public shows. When these were ended, they were again invited to the feast, but with the condition that they were to eat on the first day with Abram, on the second with Isaac, on the third with Jacob, on the fourth with Peter, on the fifth with James, on the sixth with John, on the seventh with Paul, and with the rest in order till the fifteenth day, when the festivities would be renewed in the same order, changing seats, and so on to eternity.</p><p>[3] After this, the angel, calling together the men of his company, said to them: "All those whom you saw at the tables had been in like imaginary thought with yourselves concerning the joys of heaven and eternal happiness therefrom; and such mock festivities have been provided and permitted by the Lord to the end that they may see the vanity of their ideas and be led out of them. Those men whom you saw at the heads of the tables were impersonated, being old men, many of them bearded men of the peasant class who, because of some wealth, were prouder than others, and on whom was induced the fantasy that they were the ancient patriarchs. But follow me into the ways leading out of this school of sports."</p><p>[4] Following him, they then saw some fifty here and fifty there who had filled their bellies with food even to nausea, and were longing to return to their home affairs, some to their offices, some to their shops, and some to their trades. But many were detained by the keepers of the grove, and were asked about their days of feasting and whether they had yet eaten at table with peter and with Paul, and whether they were going away before they had done so, which would be unbecoming and so would be to their shame. But most of them answered, "We are sated with our joys; food has become insipid to us, and its flavor dry. Our stomachs loathe it; we cannot bear to taste it. We have dragged out some days and nights in this luxury, and beg earnestly to be allowed to go." Then, being released, they fled to their homes with panting breath and rapid pace.</p><p>[5] The angel then called the men of his company together, and on the way gave them the following instruction concerning heaven: "In heaven, as in the world, there are foods and drinks; there are feasts and banquets; and with the leading men there are tables spread with sumptuous delicacies and choice and delicious foods wherewith the animus is exhilarated and recreated. There are also sports, public shows, and entertainments of music and song; and all these in the highest perfection. Such things are joys to them also, but they are not happiness. The latter must be within the joys, and then from the joys. Happiness within joys makes joys to be joys, enriching them and keeping them from becoming cheap and loathsome; and this happiness, every one has from the performance of use in his own function.</p><p>[6] Within the affection of every angel's will is a latent vein which draws the mind on to the doing of something. By this, the mind renders itself tranquil and satisfied. This satisfaction and tranquillity induce a state of mind receptive of the love of use from the Lord; and from the reception of this, comes that heavenly happiness which is the life of the joys previously mentioned. In its essence, heavenly food is nothing else than love, wisdom, and use together, that is, use from love by means of wisdom. Therefore, in heaven, food for the body is given to every one according to the use which he performs, sumptuous to those who are in eminent use, moderate but of exquisite flavor to those in a use of medium degree, common to those in a common use, but none at all to the slothful." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #6 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>6. Next the angel addressed those who had induced upon themselves the idea that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness would be feastings with Abram, Isaac and Jacob, and games and shows after the feasts, and once again feasts, and so on to eternity. He told them to follow him and he would introduce them into the happinesses of their joys. He led them through a grove to a level spot with a platform on which stood tables, fifteen on one side, fifteen on the other. "Why so many tables?" they asked. The angel replied that the first table was Abram's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's, and extending on from these in order the tables of the twelve Apostles. "On the other side are as many tables for their wives; the first three belong to Sarah, Abram's wife, Rebekah, Isaac's wife, and Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives, while the other twelve belong to the wives of the twelve Apostles."</p><p>[2] They had not waited long before all the tables appeared full of dishes of food, the spaces between the dishes embellished with pyramids holding sweetmeats. About the tables stood guests, awaiting their hosts. Presently these were seen entering, in order from Abram to the last of the Apostles. Each went to his table and reclined on a couch at its head. They bade the company, "Recline with us, too." They did so, the men with the Fathers, and the women with their wives, and ate and drank with joy and veneration.<p>After the banquet, the Fathers withdrew. Games and dances of youths and maidens began, succeeded by theatrical performances.<p>When the shows were over, all were invited to feast again, with the stipulation that they should eat with Abram on the first day, with Isaac on the second, with Jacob on the third, with Peter on the fourth, with James on the fifth, with John on the sixth, with Paul on the seventh, and in turn with the others until the fifteenth day, when they were to repeat the festivities in the same order, only changing seats, and so on to eternity.</p><p>[3] Thereupon the angel called together the members of his company and told them: "All whom you saw at the tables have had the same imaginary ideas about the joys of heaven and the eternal happiness they yield, as you. Mock festivities like this were started (they are permitted by the Lord) that people may see for themselves the vanity of their ideas and be withdrawn from them. The leaders whom you saw at the heads of the tables were counterfeited Fathers, men largely from the peasantry, who being bearded and comparatively wealthy are rather puffed up, on whom, too, the phantasy has been induced that they are those ancient Fathers. But follow me to the exits from this training-school."</p><p>[4] As they left, they saw fifty here and fifty there who had crammed their bellies with food to the point of nausea, and who longed to return to their usual affairs, stations, business or labor. Many were stopped by guards at the grove and questioned about their days of feasting - had they eaten yet with Peter, and with Paul? They were told that they should be ashamed to leave before they had done so; it would not be proper. Most of them replied, "We are sated with our joys. Food has turned tasteless and all relish for it is gone, our stomachs loathe it, we cannot endure it. We have spent long days and nights in this excess and earnestly ask to be allowed to go." On being released, they raced breathlessly home.</p><p>[5] The angel then collected the men in his charge and as they went along taught them as follows about heaven. "In heaven as in the world there are food and drink, feasts and banquets. The tables of the prominent are spread with sumptuous feasts, delicacies and luxuries, which exhilarate and revive one's spirits. There are games, too, and shows, music and song, all in the greatest perfection. Such things are joys to the angels, too, but not happiness. Happiness must fill and spring from the joys. It is the happiness within the joys which makes them joys, giving them value and keeping them from becoming cheap and tedious. This happiness one finds in the use he serves in his employment.</p><p>[6] Hidden in the affection of the will of an angel, is a certain impulse which urges the mind to do what brings it tranquillity and satisfaction. The satisfaction and tranquillity render the mind receptive of the love of use from the Lord. And by the reception of this love, comes heavenly happiness, which is the life of the joys mentioned above. Heavenly food in its essence is nothing else than love, wisdom and use together, that is, use from love by means of wisdom. Every one in heaven is therefore given food for the body according to the use which he performs - sumptuous food to those in an exalted use, modest food but of exquisite flavor to those in a moderate degree of use, ordinary to those in an ordinary use, but none to the inactive." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #6 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>6. After this the angel addressed those who had induced upon themselves the idea that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness consisted in feastings with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and after the feasts sports and public shows, and then feasts again, and so on to eternity. And he said to them:<p>'Follow me, and I will bring you into the felicities of your joys.'<p>And he led them through a grove to a level place covered with a floor, on which tables were placed, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other.<p>And they asked, 'Why so many tables?'<p>The angel answered, 'The first table is that of Abraham, the second that of Isaac, the third that of Jacob; and next to these in order are the tables of the twelve apostles. On the other side is the same number of tables, those of their wives; the first three are those of Sarah the wife of Abraham, Rebecca the wife of Isaac, and Leah and Rachel the wives of Jacob; and the other twelve are those of the wives of the twelve apostles.'<p>After some delay all the tables appeared to be filled with dishes of food, and the little spaces between them were ornamented by small pyramids with sweetmeats. The guests stood around them in expectation of seeing the hosts of the tables. They who were expected were shortly seen to enter, in order of procession from Abraham to the last of the apostles; and presently each approached his own table, and reclined upon a couch at its head. And from their places they said to those that stood around, 'Recline ye also with us.' And they did so, the men with the Fathers, and the women with their wives; and they ate and drank in joy and with veneration.<p>After the feast the Fathers went out, and then began the sports, the dances of youths and maidens, and after them the public shows.<p>These being ended they were invited to feast again, but with the condition that they were to eat on the first day with Abraham, on the second with Isaac, on the third with Jacob, on the fourth with Peter, on the fifth with James, on the sixth with John, on the seventh with Paul, and with the rest in order to the fifteenth day; from which again the festivities would be renewed in the same order, changing seats, and so on to eternity.<p>After this the angel called together the men of the company and said to them, 'All those whom you saw at the tables had been in similar imaginary thought with yourselves concerning the joys of heaven and eternal happiness therefrom; and such mock festivities were provided and were permitted by the Lord to the end that they may themselves see the vanity of their ideas, and thereby be led out of them. The chief men whom you saw at the head of the tables were old men playing a part, most of them rustics, who being bearded and of some wealth were prouder than others, upon whom was induced the phantasy that they were these ancient Fathers. But follow me into the ways leading out of this place of discipline.'<p>And they followed and saw some fifty here and fifty there who had filled their bellies with food even to nausea, and were longing to return to the familiar scenes of their homes, some to their public offices, some to their merchandise, and some to their labor. But many were detained by the keepers of the grove, and were asked about their days of feasting, and whether they had yet eaten at the table with Peter and with Paul, and if they were going away before they had done so? For as this would be unbecoming, it would be to their shame. But most of them answered, 'We are sated with our joys; food has become insipid to us; we have lost relish for it; our stomachs loathe it; we cannot bear to taste it. We have dragged on some days and nights in this luxury, and beg earnestly that we may be permitted to go away.' And being allowed to go, they with rapid pace and panting breath fled to their homes.<p>The angel then called together the men of the company, and on the way gave them this instruction concerning heaven: 'In heaven, as in the world, there are foods and drinks, there are festive meals and banquets; and with the principal persons there are tables spread with sumptuous delicacies, with choice and delicious viands, wherewith they are exhilarated and refreshed in spirit. And there are also sports and exhibitions, and entertainments of music and song; and all these in the highest perfection. And such things give them joys, but not happiness. This must be within the joys, and thence from the joys. Happiness within joys makes them joys indeed. It enriches and sustains them, that they do not become worthless nor disdained. And this happiness everyone has from the performance of use in his employment. There is a certain latent vein within the affection of the will of every angel which draws the mind on to do something. By this the mind tranquillizes and satisfies itself. This satisfaction and this tranquility induce a state of mind receptive of the love of use from the Lord. And from the reception of this comes heavenly happiness, which is the life of their joys before mentioned. Heavenly food in its essence is nothing else than love, wisdom, and use together, that is, use from love by wisdom. Wherefore, in heaven, food for the body is given to everyone according to the use that he performs, sumptuous to those who are in eminent use, moderate but of exquisite flavor to those in a medium degree of use, simple to those in inferior use, but none to the slothful.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #6 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>6. Post haec Angelus alloquutus est illos, qui induxerant sibi ideam de Gaudiis Coeli, et de Felicitate aeterna, quod forent Epulationes cum Abramo, Isaco et Jacobo; et post epulas Ludi et Spectacula, ac iterum Epulae, et sic in aeternum: et dixit illis, "sequimini me, et introducam vos in gaudiorum vestrorum felicitates;" et introduxit illos per nemus in planitiem stratam asseribus, super qua positae erant Mensae, quindecim ab uno latere, et quindecim ab altero; et quaesiverunt, "cur tot mensae," et respondit Angelus, quod prima mensa sit Abrami, secunda Isaci, tertia Jacobi, et juxta has in serie mensae duodecim Apostolorum; "ab altero latere totidem mensae Uxorum illorum, et tres primae mensae sunt Sarae uxoris Abrami, Rebeccae uxoris Isaci, ac Leae et Rachelis uxorum Jacobi; ac duodecim reliquae sunt uxorum duodecim Apostolorum."</p><p>[2] Post aliquam moram, apparebant omnes Mensae plenae ferculis, et spatiola inter haec ornata parvis pyramidibus cum condituris. Epulaturi stabant circum illas in exspectatione videndi Praesules mensarum; qui pauculum exspectati visi sunt in ordine processionis ab Abramo ad ultimum Apostolorum intrantes; et mox quisque ad suam mensam accedens se reposuit super toro ad caput ejus; et inde dixerunt ad circumstantes, "discumbite etiam vos nobiscum;" et discubuerunt viri cum Patribus illis, et foeminae cum Uxoribus illorum, et comederunt et biberunt in laetitia, et cum veneratione. Post prandium exiverunt illi Patres; et tunc instituti sunt ludi, choreae virginum et juvenum, et post has spectacula: quibus finitis invitabantur iterum ad Epulas, sed cum statuto, quod primo die comederent cum Abramo, altero cum Isaco, tertio cum Jacobo, quarto cum Petro, quinto cum Jacobo, sexto cum Johanne, septimo cum Paulo, et cum reliquis in ordine usque ad quindecimum diem, a quo iterum in simili ordine commessationes renovarent variando sedes, et sic in aeternum.</p><p>[3] Post haec Angelus convocavit viros cohortis, et dixit illis, "hi omnes, quos vidistis ad mensas, in simili cogitatione imaginaria de Gaudiis Coeli, et inde Felicitate aeterna, cum vobis fuerant; et propter finem, ut ipsi videant vanitates idearum suarum, et ab illis abducantur, institutae sunt, et a Domino permissae tales epulares scenae. Primores illi, quos vidistis ad capita mensarum, erant personati <sup>1</sup>senes, plerique ex rustica gente, qui barbati, et ex quadam opulentia prae caeteris fastuosi, quibus inducta est phantasia, quod vetusti illi Patres essent. Sed sequimini me in vias exitus e palaestra hac;"</p><p>[4] et sequuti sunt, et videbant quinquaginta hic et quinquaginta ibi, qui farciverant ventres cibariis usque ad nauseas, et concupiverunt redire ad familiaria domuum suarum, quidam ad sua munia, quidam ad sua negotia, et quidam ad suas operas: at multi a custodibus nemoris retenti et interrogati de diebus epulationis illorum, et num adhuc ad mensas cum Petro et cum Paulo comederint, et si prius exirent, hoc, quia indecens est, futurum illis pudori: sed plerique respondebant, "explevimus gaudia nostra, cibi facti sunt nobis insipidi, ac gustus torridus, fastidit illos stomachus, non sustinemus libare illos; protraximus aliquot dies et noctes in luxurie illa, impense rogamus ut emittamur;" ac dimissi, anhelo spiritu et festino cursu aufugerunt domum.</p><p>[5] Post haec Angelus vocavit viros cohortis, et in via docuit illos haec de Coelo: "in Coelo aeque sicut in Mundo sunt Cibi et Potus, sunt Commessationes et Convivia; et apud Primores ibi sunt Mensae super quibus sunt opimae dapes, cupediae et lautitiae, quibus exhilarantur et recreantur animi; et sunt quoque Ludi et Spectacula; et sunt Musicalia et Cantica; et omnia illa in summa perfectione; talia sunt illis etiam in gaudia, sed non in felicitatem; haec erit in gaudiis, et inde ex gaudiis; felicitas in gaudiis facit ut gaudia sint gaudia, opimat illa, et sustentat ne vilescant et fastidiantur; et haec felicitas est cuivis ex usu in sua functione.</p><p>[6] Est aliqua vena in affectione voluntatis cujusvis Angeli latens, quae attrahit mentem ad aliquid faciendum; mens per hoc tranquillat se, et satisfacit sibi; haec satisfactio et illa tranquillitas faciunt statum mentis receptibilem amoris usus a Domino; ex receptione hujus est Felicitas coelestis, quae est vita illorum gaudiorum, quae prius memorata sunt. Cibus coelestis in sua essentia nec aliud est quam amor, sapientia et usus simul, hoc est, usus per sapientiam ex amore; quamobrem unicuivis in Coelo datur cibus pro corpore secundum usum <sup>2</sup>quem praestat, magnificus illis qui in eminente usu sunt, modicus sed exquisiti saporis illis qui in medii gradus usu sunt, et vilis illis qui in vili usu sunt, at nullus socordibus."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: porsonati<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: usum, </p>
