<h4 align="center"></h4><p>50、⑹然后，男人会被赐予一个合适的妻子，女人会被赐予一个合适的丈夫。这是因为，只有那些产生内在结合，或好似合而为一的夫妻才能被接入天堂，从而留在那里。因为天上的夫妻不再被视为两位，而被视为一位天使。这就是主说“夫妻不再是两个人，乃是一体的了”之意。这些人才是被接到天上的夫妻，因为他们是共同生活在天堂的一体，即同在一个屋檐下，同居一个卧室，同睡一张床的一体。凡在天堂者皆照爱的亲密度和相似度产生结合，他们的家也取决于此。这是因为，灵界不存在维度空间，只有空间的表象，这些表象取决于其生命状态，其生命状态则取决于爱的状态。因此，在灵界，人只能住在自己的房子里，这房子是照着其爱的性质被分配并指定给他的。他若住在别的地方，就会感到胸闷，呼吸困难。而且，若非极其相似，两个人无法生活在同一个屋檐下。所以，夫妻若非互相吸引，根本无法共同生活。若他们的感情仅是外在的，而非同时是内在的，这房子或居所本身就会分开、拒绝和驱逐他们。因此，那些预备后可以进入天堂的人都会有婚姻，主会为其提供一个伴侣。二者的灵魂会互相强烈吸引，以致他们不想有两个生命，而想拥有一个生命。正因如此，分开之后，男人会被赐予一个合适的妻子，女人会被赐予一个合适的丈夫。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>50、（6）男人会有一个适合的妻子，女人会有一个合适的丈夫。因为只有内在上相结合的夫妻才能留在天堂中，或有说只有能结合唯一的夫妻才能留在天堂中。因为夫妻在天堂中不再是两个而是一个天使。这就主在《圣经》中为什么说夫妻不再是两个人，而是一个人的原因。</p><p>为什么只有这样的夫妻才能在天堂中是因为只有他们才能生活在一起。他们有互相亲和的本质和相似的爱。他们的家也由此而存在。因为天堂中没有空间的大小，而只有空间的形式。这种空间的形式由他们的生命的境界决定，他们生命的境界由他们爱的形式而决定。</p><p>因此，在天堂没有人可以想到那里就到哪里，而只能留在自己的房子里。这样的房子是根据他们的爱本质而被分配给他的。如果他到别处去就会感到呼吸困难。同样道理，除非两个人相似，否则他们不能同住在一个房子里。除非夫妻双方对彼此的感情是一致的，否则他们也不能生活在一起。若彼此相吸引的地方只是外在的，他们就不能留在同一个房子里。</p><p>所以，在为天堂而做准备的人会被提供给一个配偶。这个配偶的灵魂倾向于与一方相结合，他们不希望是要两人生命而是一个生命。这就是为什么夫妻相分别后，男人会有一个合适的妻子，女人会有一个适合的丈夫。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #50 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>50. (vi) In this case a man is given a suitable wife, and the woman likewise a husband.<p>This is because only those couples who have been or can be inwardly united to make one can be accepted into heaven to stay there. For in heaven a couple are not called two, but one angel. This is what is meant by the Lord's words, that they are no longer two, but one flesh. The reason why no other couples are accepted into heaven is that no other people can there live together, that is, in one house sharing a room and a bed. For it is the affinity and closeness of their love which determines everyone's associations in the heavens, and equally where they live. The spiritual world does not have space, but the appearance of space, and this appearance depends upon the way in which people live, which in turn depends upon the way they love. No one therefore can stay anywhere but in his own house, which is provided for him and allocated depending on the nature of his love. If he lives elsewhere, his chest feels tight and he has difficulty in breathing.<p>Two people cannot live together in the same house unless they are exactly alike; nor consequently can married couples, unless they have the same feelings towards each other. If the feelings are only outward and not at the same time inward, the house or the location itself parts them, rejecting them and driving them away. This is why those who are after preparation admitted to heaven have a marriage provided for them with a partner, whose soul is so strongly attracted to union with the other's, that they do not wish to have two lives, but one. It is for this reason that after parting a man is given a suitable wife and a woman likewise a suitable husband. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #50 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>50. 6. A man is then given a suitable wife, and a woman, likewise, a suitable husband. This is because the only married couples who can be accepted into heaven so as to remain there are those who have been inwardly united, or who can be united as though into one. For married couples in heaven are not called two but one angel. This is meant by the Lord's words, that they are no longer two but one flesh. <sup >1</sup><p>The reason these are the only married couples who can be accepted into heaven is that they are the only ones who can live together there, that is, who can be together in the same house and in the same bedroom and bed. For all those who are in heaven are associated according to the affinities and close similarities of their love, and their homes are determined accordingly. This is because there are no dimensional spaces in the spiritual world, but they have appearances of space, and these appearances are determined according to the states of their life, and their states of life are determined according to states of love.<p>Consequently, no one in the spiritual world can stay anywhere but in his own house, which is provided and appointed for him according to the nature of his love. If he stays anywhere else, his chest labors and he has difficulty breathing. By the same token, two people cannot live together in the same house unless they are likenesses of each other. And they cannot live together at all as married partners unless their feelings for each other are mutual. If these feelings of attraction are external and not at the same time internal, the very house or place separates them, repels them and drives them away.<p>So it is that, in the case of people who after preparation are introduced into heaven, marriage is provided with a partner whose soul inclines to union with the soul of the other, to the point that they do not wish to lead two lives but one. That is why, after separation, a man is given a suitable wife, and a woman, likewise, a suitable husband.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_8.htm">Mark 10:8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #50 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>50. 6. Then the man gets a suitable wife and the wife a suitable husband. The reason is that no married partners can be accepted into heaven to stay there unless they are united inwardly, or can be united as if they are one. For they do not call two partners there two, but one angel. The Lord made this known in His words that they are "no longer two but one flesh."<p>The reason no others are accepted into heaven is that no others can live together there - that is, be together in the same house, and in the same bedroom and bed. For everybody in heaven associates according to relationships and kinships of love, and they have their homes according to these. For there is no distance in the spiritual world, but something that seems like distance, which depends on the condition of your life. The condition of your life depends on the condition of your love. So no one there can live anywhere but in the home provided and assigned him according to what his love is like. Anywhere else his chest heaves and he has trouble breathing. And two people cannot live together in the same house unless they are alike - and certainly not married partners, unless they are mutually inclined. If there are external inclinations and not inner ones too, the house itself, and the very place, separates, rejects, and expels them.<p>This is why those who are ready and are accepted into heaven are able to marry a partner whose soul is so much inclined to unite with the other person that they do not want to be two lives but one. This is why, after separation, a man gets a suitable wife and a woman a suitable husband. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #50 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>50. VI. THAT THEN A SUITABLE WIFE IS GIVEN TO THE MAN, AND LIKEWISE A SUITABLE HUSBAND TO THE WOMAN. The reason is, because no other married partners can be received into heaven and remain there save those who are inwardly united or can be united as into a one; for there, two partners are not called two but one angel. This is meant by the Lord's words, They are no more two but one flesh. That no other married partners are received into heaven, is because there, no others can live together, that is, can be together in one house and one chamber and bed; for in heaven all are consociated according to the affinities and relationships of love, and it is according to these that they have their abodes. In the spiritual world, there are not spaces but appearances of spaces, and these are according to the states of their life, the states of their life being according to the states of their love. For this reason, no one there can abide in any house but his own. This also is provided, and it is assigned to him according to the quality of his love. If he abides elsewhere, he is troubled in his breast and breathing. Moreover, two persons cannot live together in the same house unless they are similitudes; and by no means married partners unless they have mutual inclinations. If their inclinations are external and not at the same time internal, the very house or very place separates, rejects, and expels them. This is the reason why, for those who after preparation are introduced into heaven, a marriage is provided with a consort whose soul so inclines to union with that of the other that they do not wish to be two lives but one. It is for this reason that after separation, a suitable wife is given to the man, and a suitable husband to the woman. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #50 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>50. (vi) The man is then given a suitable wife, and the woman a suitable husband. For no other partners can be received permanently into heaven except those inwardly united or capable of being united as it were into one. Two partners there are not even called two, but one angel. This is meant by the Lord's words that they are no longer two but one flesh. <sup >1</sup>No other partners are received into heaven because no others can live together there, that is, be together in one home, chamber and bed. For all in the heavens are associated and have their dwellings according to affinities and nearnesses of love. For spaces do not exist in the spiritual world, but appearances of spaces, which answer to the states of life, and these to the states of love. Therefore no one can remain anywhere but in his own home, which is provided him and marked out by his love's nature. Elsewhere he labors in chest and breathing. Two cannot dwell together, either, in the same home, unless they are likenesses; and partners emphatically cannot unless they are mutual inclinations. If they are external inclinations but not at the same time internal, the house or the place itself separates, rejects and expels them. Those, therefore, who after preparation are introduced into heaven, are provided a marriage with a partner whose soul inclines to union with the other's, so much so that they wish not to be two lives but one. Hence after a separation there is given the man a suitable wife, and the wife a suitable husband.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_8.htm">Mark 10:8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #50 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>50. (6) That then a suitable wife is given to the man and a suitable husband to the woman. The reason of this is, that no married partners can be received into heaven and remain there but such as are inwardly united, or as can be united, as into one; for there two married partners are not called two but one angel. This is meant by the Lord's words, that:<p>They are no more twain, but one flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>).<p>That no other married pairs are received into heaven is because no others can live together there, that is, be together in one house and in one chamber and bed. For in heaven all are consociated according to affinities and nearnesses of love; and according to these they have their abodes. For in the spiritual world there are not spaces but appearances of space, and these are according to the states of their life, and states of life are according to the states of love. For this reason no one there can dwell in any but his own house, which is provided and assigned to him according to the quality of his love. If he abides elsewhere he labors in the breast and breathing. Nor can two live together in the same house unless they are similitudes; and especially married partners cannot, unless they are mutual inclinations. If they are external inclinations and not at the same time internal, the very house or very place separates, rejects, and expels them. This is the reason why, for those who after preparation are introduced into heaven, a marriage is provided with a consort whose soul so inclines to union with that of the other that they do not desire to be two lives but one. And it is for this reason that after separation a suitable wife is given to the man, and a suitable husband to the woman in like manner. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #50 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>50. VI: Quod tunc detur viro uxor conveniens, ac foeminae maritus similiter. <sup>1</sup>Causa est, quia non alii Conjuges possunt recipi in Coelum, ut ibi maneant, nisi qui interius uniti sunt, aut uniri possunt sicut in unum, nam ibi duo Conjuges non vocantur duo, sed unus Angelus; quod intelligitur per Domini verba, quod non sint duo amplius, sed una caro. Quod non alii Conjuges recipiantur in Coelum, est quia non alii possunt ibi cohabitare, hoc est, simul esse in una domo, inque cubiculo et toro; omnes enim qui in Coelis sunt, consociati sunt secundum affinitates et propinquitates amoris, et secundum has sunt habitationes illis; nam in Mundo spirituali non sunt spatia, sed sunt apparentiae spatiorum, et hae sunt secundum status vitae illorum, et status vitae sunt secundum status amoris; quare non potest aliquis ibi morari nisi in sua domo, quae illi providetur et designatur secundum quale ejus amoris; si alibi, laborat pectore et anhelitu; et non possunt duo cohabitare in eadem domo, nisi sint similitudines; et prorsus non Conjuges, nisi sint inclinationes mutuae; si sunt inclinationes externae et non simul internae, ipsa domus seu ipse locus separat, rejicit, et abigit illos: haec est causa, quod illis, qui post praeparationem introducuntur in Coelum, provideatur Conjugium cum consorte, cujus anima inclinat ad unionem cum alterius, adeo ut non velint duae vitae esse sed una: haec causa est, quod post separationem detur viro uxor conveniens, et foeminae maritus similiter.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: similiter.: </p>
