<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第458节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>458、这爱之所以是基督教的宝库，是因为基督教与这爱构成一体，并与它同居。事实上，前面已说明，只有那些靠近主，热爱祂教会的真理，并行出它的良善之人，才能拥有这爱，并持续处于其中（70-72节）；这爱唯独来自主，因而与那些属于基督教的人同在（131，336，337节）；这爱取决于教会的状态，因为它取决于人的智慧状态（130节）。这一切已在整个第四章关于“婚姻之爱和主与教会的婚姻之间存在对应关系”的章节（116-131节）和第五章关于“婚姻之爱源于良善与真理的婚姻”的章节（83-102节）中得以证实。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>458、关于这种爱是基督教的要求之一是因为宗教与这种爱不可分割。我们讲过只有跟随爱主的教会的真理的人才会拥有这种爱（见70-72节）；这种爱只来自于主，因此它存在于信基督教的人中（见131、336、337节）；这种爱与人身上教会的状态有关，因为它依赖于人的智慧程度（130节）。这点还在主与教会相结合的一章中阐述过（116-131节），这在善与真理的结合即这一爱的来源一章讲过（见83-102节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #458 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>458. The reason why this love is a treasure-house of Christian religion is that this religion makes one with that love and lives with it. For it has been shown that only those who approach the Lord and [love] the truths of His church and do its good deeds can come into possession of that love and continue in it (<a href="70.htm">70-71</a>) <sup >1</sup>. Likewise it was shown that the Lord is the sole source of that love, so that it is only possible among those of the Christian religion (<a href="131.htm">131</a>, <a href="335.htm">335-336</a>); this love depends upon the state of the church, which is in turn dependent on a person's state of wisdom (<a href="130.htm">130</a>). For a proof of these points see the whole chapter [VI] on its correspondence with the marriage of the Lord and the church (<a href="116.htm">116-131</a>), and the chapter [V] on the source of this love as coming from the marriage of good and truth. (<a href="83.htm">83-102</a>).<p><a href="58.htm">58-59</a> in the original. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #458 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>458. As for the statement that this love is the repository of Christian religion, that is because that religion is coupled with and lodges together with this love. For we have shown that no others come into this love and no others can be in it but those who go to the Lord and love the truths of the church and do the good things it teaches (nos. <a href="70.htm">70-72</a>); that this love comes from the Lord alone, and consequently is found with people who are of the Christian religion (nos. <a href="131.htm">131</a>, <a href="336.htm">336</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>); and that this love depends on the state of the church in a person, because it depends on the state of his wisdom (no. <a href="130.htm">130</a>). The truth of all this was established in the whole chapter on the correspondence of this love with the marriage of the Lord and the church (nos. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>); and in the chapter on the origin of this love from the marriage between good and truth (nos. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #458 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>458. This love is the Christian religion's treasury because this religion becomes one with this love and they live together. For it was pointed out that no others come into that love or can be in it, except those who approach the Lord and do the true and good things of His church (nos. <a href="70.htm">70-71</a>). That love is from the Lord only and is found only among those who are of the Christian religion (nos. <a href="131.htm">131</a>,<p>335, 336). Married love is in keeping with the condition of the church, because it is in keeping with the state of wisdom in a<p>person (no. 130). In the whole chapter about its correspondence with the marriage of the Lord and the church (nos. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>), and in the chapter about the source of that love from the marriage of good and truth (nos. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>), it is established that these things are so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #458 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>458. That this love is the repository of the Christian religion is because that religion makes one with the love, and cohabits with it; for it has been shown that no others come into that love and can be in it save those who approach the Lord, love the truths of His Church, and do its goods (nos. <a href="70.htm">70, 71</a>); that that love is from the Lord alone, and hence is with those who are of the Christian religion (nos. <a href="131.htm">131</a>,<a href="335.htm">335, 336</a>); that that love is according to the state of the Church because according to the state of wisdom with man (no. <a href="130.htm">130</a>). All this is confirmed in the entire chapter on its correspondence with the marriage of the Lord and the Church (nos. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>); and In the chapter On the origin of that love from the marriage of good and truth (nos. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #458 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>458. Marital love is the repository of the Christian religion for the reason that the Christian religion makes one with this love and cohabits with it. For, as was shown, only those come into this love, or can be in it, who approach the Lord and do the truths of His Church and its goods (nn. 70-71); this love is from the Lord alone, and hence is to be found with those who are of the Christian religion (nn. 131, 335-336); this love is according to the state of the Church in a man, being according to his state of wisdom (<a href="130.htm">130</a>). We established all these propositions in the chapter on "The Correspondence of Marital Love with the Marriage of the Lord and the Church" (n. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>); and in the chapter on "The Origin of Marital Love in the Marriage of Good and Truth" (n. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #458 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>458. Conjugial love is the repository of the Christian religion because that religion makes one and dwells together with this love. For, it has been shown that no others can come into this love, and be in it, but those who approach the Lord and do the truths of His church and its goods (n. <a href="70.htm">70</a>, <a href="71.htm">71</a>): That this love is from the Lord only, and for that reason is with those who are of the Christian religion (n. <a href="131.htm">131</a>, <a href="335.htm">335</a>, <a href="336.htm">336</a>): That this love is according to the state of the church, because it is according to the state of wisdom with man (n. <a href="130.htm">130</a>). That these things are so, is confirmed in the entire chapter, On its Correspondence with the Marriage of the Lord and the Church (n. <a href="116.htm">116-131</a>); and in the chapter, On the Origin of this Love from the Marriage of Good and Truth (n. <a href="83.htm">83-102</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #458 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>458. Quod ille Amor sit Reconditorium religionis Christianae, est quia haec Religio cum illo amore unum facit et cohabitat; nam ostensum est, quod non alii in illum amorem veniant, et in illo esse possint, quam qui adeunt Dominum, ac vera Ecclesiae Ipsius et bona ejus faciunt,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_70" target=_top>70-72</a>. <sup>1</sup>Quod ille amor sit a Solo Domino, et quod inde detur apud illos qui ex Religione Christiana sunt,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_131" target=_top>131</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_336" target=_top>336</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_337" target=_top>337</a>: <sup>2</sup>quod Amor ille sit secundum statum Ecclesiae, quia est secundum statum sapientiae, apud hominem,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_130" target=_top>130</a>: quod haec ita sint, confirmatum est in toto Capite, de Correspondentia ejus cum Conjugio Domini et Ecclesiae,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_116" target=_top>116-131</a>; et in Capite de Origine illius amoris ex Conjugio boni et veri, <sup>3</sup>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_83" target=_top>83-102</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio:<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_58" target=_top>58</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_59" target=_top>59</a><p>2.&nbsp;Prima editio:<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_131" target=_top>131</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_335" target=_top>335</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_458/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_336" target=_top>336</a><p>3.&nbsp;Prima editio: verl, </p>
