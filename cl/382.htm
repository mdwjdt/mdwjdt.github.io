<h4 align="center"></h4><p>382．“除了爱，美丽的起源还能是别的什么吗？当爱流入年轻人的眼中、点燃他们时，它就变成了美丽。所以，爱和美丽为一，是一回事。爱从至内层以一种火焰染红适婚少女的脸庞，这种闪耀给她的生命赋上黎明的紫光。谁不知道这火焰放射的光芒映入她的眼帘，从这些中心扩散到脸周围，又从那里降至胸部，点燃她的内心，作用于她，就像一团火以其热和光作用于旁边的人。这热就是爱，这光就是爱的美丽。全世界都坚信，人皆因他的爱而可爱和美丽。不过，男性的爱是一回事，女性的爱是另一回事。男性的爱是对变得智慧的爱，而女性的爱是对热爱男性对变得智慧的爱之爱。因此，少男越热爱智慧，他在少女眼里就越可爱、美丽；而少女越热爱少男的智慧，她在少男眼里就越可爱、美丽。因此，正如一方的爱遇见并亲吻对方的爱，二者的美丽也是如此。我由此得出这样的结论：爱将美丽塑造为自己的形像。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>382、他说：“除了爱，美还有什么来源呢？当爱流入小伙子的眼中并点燃火花时，不就产生了美吗。所以爱和美是一回事儿。因为内心的爱会使姑娘的脸上燃出爱之火，其中产生了生命的光亮。谁不知道那种火放出光，射入她的眼睛，并由此做为中心而散发到她的脸上？并流入她的胸中，点燃她的心并影响周围的人。正如同火的光和热所产生的结果一样。这种情况下的热就是爱，光就是爱的美丽。</p><p>“举世皆知每个人因其爱而变得可爱，美丽。但是男性拥有的爱是一样，女性拥有的爱是另一样。男性的爱是对变得有智慧的爱，而女性的爱则是爱男人对变得有智慧的爱。因此，根据年青人对智慧的爱，他就会在少女看来美，可爱。同时根据对年青男子智慧的爱，少女就会在小伙子看来可爱，美丽。因此当一种爱与另一种爱相遇，一种美与另一种美相遇时，爱和美就是一样的了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #382 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>382. 'What else can be the source of beauty but love, which turns into beauty as it reaches the eyes of young men and lights them up? Love and beauty are therefore the same thing. For love from the innermost level tinges the face of a marriageable maiden with a kind of flame, and this shining through gives her life the purple glow of dawn. Everyone must be aware that this flame darts rays into her eyes, and from these centres it spreads around the face, and also sinks down to her bosom and fires her heart, so that its heat and light act upon the bystander in the same way as a fire. The heat is love, the light is the beauty of love. The whole world agrees in the firm belief that everyone's love determines his likeableness and beauty. But there is a difference between the love felt by the male sex and that felt by the female sex. Male love is the love of being wise, female love the love of loving the male's love of being wise. Thus the more a young man loves wisdom, the more he is to the maiden loveable and beautiful; and the more the maiden loves the young man's wisdom, the more loveable and beautiful she is to the young man. So just as the love of one goes to meet and embraces the other's, so too do their beauties. I thus arrive at the conclusion that love shapes beauty to resemble itself.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #382 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>382. "What is the origin of beauty," he said, "other than love? When love flows into the eyes of young men and sets them on fire, it becomes beauty. Therefore love and beauty are the same thing. For love from within suffuses the face of a marriageable young woman with a kind of flame, from whose radiance comes the dawn and crimson glow of her life. Who does not know that that flame emits its rays into her eyes, and from these as centers spreads out into the circumference of her face? And also descends into her breast and kindles the heart, and thus affects one standing by, in the same way that fire does with its warmth and light? The warmth in this case is love, and the light, the beauty of love.<p>"The whole world agrees in affirming that everyone is lovable and beautiful in accordance with his love. But still the love possessed by the masculine sex is one thing, and the love possessed by the feminine sex another. The love in males is a love of growing wise, and the love in females is a love of loving the love of growing wise in a male. Consequently, in the measure that a youth exhibits a love of growing wise, in the same measure he is lovable and beautiful to a maiden; and in the measure that a maiden exhibits a love of a youth's wisdom, in the same measure she is lovable and beautiful to the youth. Accordingly, as the love of the one meets and kisses the love of the other, so also do the beauty of the one and the beauty of the other. I conclude, therefore, that love forms beauty into a likeness of itself." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #382 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>382. "What source of beauty is there other than love? When it floods into young men's eyes and sets them afire, it becomes beauty. So love and beauty are the same thing. For love tints the face of a marriageable young woman from deep within like a flame, with a transparency that is the daybreak and crimson of her life. Who does not know that this flame sends rays into her eyes and from them as a center spreads over her whole face, and it sinks into her breast as well, sets her heart on fire, and in this way has an effect no different from the warmth and light of a fire to someone standing by it. This warmth is love, and this light is love's beauty.<p>"The whole world agrees that someone is beautiful according to his love. But the masculine sex's love is different from the feminine sex's love. Masculine love is love of becoming wise, and feminine love is love of loving the love of becoming wise in the masculine. So a young man is lovable and beautiful to a young woman in the measure that he has a love of becoming wise, and a young woman is lovable and beautiful to a young man in the measure that she has a love of the young man's wisdom. So just as one's love meets and kisses the other's, their beauties do the same. And so I conclude that love forms beauty in its likeness." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #382 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>382. "What other origin of beauty can there be than LOVE? When this flows into the eyes of young men and enkindles them, it becomes beauty. Therefore, love and beauty are one and the same thing; for, from the inmost being of a marriageable virgin love suffuses her face with a certain flame, and from the appearance of this, comes the dawn of her life and its crimson glow. Who does not know that this flame sends its rays into her eyes; that from these as centers, it pours forth into the circuit of her face, and from there lets itself down into her bosom and enkindles her heart, and affects her, not unlike as a fire with its heat and light affects one who stands by it. The heat is love and the light is the beauty of love. The whole world affirms with common consent, that every person is lovely and beautiful according to his love. But the love belonging to the masculine sex is one thing, and that belonging to the feminine sex another. Masculine love is the love of becoming wise, and feminine love, the love of loving the love of becoming wise in the male. So far then as a young man is a love of becoming wise, he is lovely and beautiful to a maiden; and so far as a maiden is a love of the wisdom of a young man, she is lovely and beautiful to the young man. Therefore, as the love of the one meets and kisses the love of the other, so also do the beauties. I conclude, therefore, that love forms beauty into the likeness of itself." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #382 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>382. "What is beauty's origin but love? Love, flowing into the eyes and enkindling a young woman, becomes beauty. Love and beauty are the same thing therefore. For love from the inmost suffuses the face of a marriageable virgin with a kind of flame, the outflashing of which is the awakening and bloom of her life. Who does not know that that flame irradiates her eyes, and from them as centers overspreads the oval of her face, descends, too, into the breast, kindles the heart, and thus affects others much as the heat and light of a fire affect a person standing near? The heat in this case is love, and the light, the beauty of love. All the world agrees in affirming that every one is lovely and beautiful according to his or her love. Still, love in the male sex is one thing, and love in the female sex another. Masculine love is the love of becoming wise. Feminine love is the love of loving the love of becoming wise in the male. As far then as a young man is the love of becoming wise, he is lovely and beautiful to a maiden; and as far as a maiden is the love of a young man's wisdom, she is lovely and beautiful to the young man. As therefore the love of the one meets and kisses the love of the other, so do the beauty in the one and the beauty in the other. I conclude then that love fashions beauty in the likeness of itself." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #382 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>382. 'What origin is there of beauty other than love, which as it flows into the eyes of young men and kindles them becomes beauty. Love and beauty are therefore, the same thing; for love, from the inmost, suffuses the face of a marriageable virgin with a kind of flame, from the transparency of which is the dawn and bloom of her life. Who does not know that that flame emits rays into her eyes, and from them as centers overspreads the orb of her face, and thence descends also into the breast and kindles the heart and thus affects, much as the heat and light of a fire affect one standing near? That heat is love, and that light is the beauty of love. The whole world, by common consent, affirms that everyone is lovely and beautiful according to his or her love. But yet the love of the male sex is one, and the love of the female sex is another. Masculine love is the love of becoming wise, and feminine love is the love of loving the love of becoming wise in the male. In so far then as a young man is the love of becoming wise, he is lovely and beautiful to a maiden; and in so far as a maiden is the love of the wisdom of a young man, she is lovely and beautiful to the young man. And therefore, as the love of the one meets and kisses the love of the other, so do the beauties also. I conclude then that love forms beauty in the likeness of itself,' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #382 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>382. "Quid Origo pulchritudinis aliud quam Amor, qui cum influit in oculos juvenum, et accendit illos, fit pulchritudo, quare Amor et Pulchritudo res eadem sunt; Amor enim ab intimo subpingit faciem virginis nubilis quadam flamma, ex cujus transparentia est aurora et purpura vitae ejus; quis non scit quod flamma illa mittat radios in ejus oculos, et ex his ut centris in orbem faciei se effundat, et quoque se demittat in pectus, ac incendat cor, et sic afficiat, non aliter quam ignis calore et luce adstantem; Calor ille est Amor, et Lux illa est amoris pulchritudo. Totus orbis firmat consensu, quod quisque sit amabilis et pulcher secundum suum amorem; sed usque est alius amor Sexus masculini, et alius amor Sexus foeminini; amor masculinus est amor sapiendi, et amor foemininus est amor amandi amorem sapiendi in masculo; quantum itaque juvenis est amor sapiendi, tantum est amabilis et pulcher virgini, et quantum virgo est amor sapientiae juvenis, tantum illa est amabilis et pulchra juveni; quare sicut amor obviat et osculatur amorem alterius, ita quoque pulchritudines: concludo itaque quod Amor formet pulchritudinem in instar sui." </p>
