<h4 align="center"></h4><p>20、之后，天使带他们来到婚房，守门人给他们打开房门。一跨过门槛，新郎派来的天使立刻迎接他们，把他们领到里面，指给他们安排好的地方。然后，他们被邀请进入前厅，只见屋子中间摆着一张桌子，上面放了一个华丽的烛台，烛台上饰有七个分枝和碗，全是金子制成的。墙上挂着银灯，这些银灯全都发出金色光芒。烛台两边各有一张桌子，上面摆着三排烤面包，房间四个角落的桌子上有水晶高脚杯。<br><br>正当他们观看这些事物时，快看，隔壁房间的门开了，就见六个童女出来了，后面跟着新郎和新娘。他们手牵手，将彼此领到烛台对面的座位前。然后，他们就坐下来，新郎在左边，新娘在他的右边，六个童女站在新娘旁边的座位一侧。新郎身穿闪光的紫袍，一件带有以弗得的闪光亚麻上衣，以弗得上面是一个金板，周围镶有钻石。金板上刻有一只白鹭，它是该天堂社群的婚礼标志。新郎头戴主教法冠。新娘则身穿一件猩红色的披风，里面穿一件绣花长袍，从脖子直垂到脚，胸间束着金带，头戴镶有红宝石的金王冠。<br><br>他们各就各位后，新郎转向新娘，将一枚金戒指戴在她的手指上。然后，他拿出手镯和珍珠项链，将手镯套在她的手腕上，将项链挂在她的脖子上，说：“请接受这些信物。”当新娘接受它们后，新郎吻了她，并说：“现在你是我的”，然后称她为他的妻子。当他做这一切时，客人全都大声喊到：“祝福你们。”先是每个人单独说，随后大家一起喊出来。君主派来的人也代表他送出祝福。就在这时，前厅充满焚香，这是天堂赐福的标志。然后，随从们从烛台旁边的两张桌子上拿起烤面包，又端起角落的桌子上、现已盛满美酒的高脚杯，给每位客人分发面包和美酒，他们便吃喝起来。之后，丈夫和他的妻子起身，六个童女手拿现已点亮的银灯，跟随他们到了门槛。于是，这对新婚夫妇进了洞房，门就关上了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #20 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>20. After this the angel took them to the house where the wedding was, and the door-keeper opened the door to them. When they had crossed the threshold, they were at once greeted by an angel the bridegroom had sent, and they were taken inside and shown to the places allotted to them. Then they were invited into an ante-chamber, where they saw in the middle of the room a table, on which was placed a magnificent lamp-stand, equipped with seven branches and bowls, all made of gold. Attached to the walls were silver sconces, and the lights from all of these made a golden glow. Beside the lamp-stand they saw two tables, on which were arranged loaves in three rows, and in the four corners of the room were tables with goblets of crystal.</p><p>[2] While they were looking at these, the door of the next room was thrown open, and they saw six maidens coming out followed by the bridegroom and bride. They were holding hands, and they led each other to a seat set near the lamp-stand. They sat down on this, the bridegroom on the left and the bride on his right; and the six maidens took up a position beside the seat near the bride. The bridegroom was dressed in a mantle of gleaming purple and a tunic of shining linen with an ephod, on which was a golden plate set with a surround of diamonds. An egret was engraved upon this plate, the wedding emblem of this community of heaven. His head was covered with a mitre. The bride wore a red cloak over an embroidered gown falling from neck to foot, with a golden girdle below the bust; on her head she had a crown of gold set with rubies.</p><p>[3] When they had taken their places, the bridegroom turned to the bride and put a gold ring on her finger. Then he took out bracelets and a pearl necklace, and fastening the bracelets above her wrists and the necklace around her neck, he said: 'Accept these pledges.' As she accepted them, he kissed her and said: 'Now you are mine,' and he called her his wife.<p>When he did this, all the guests cried: 'A blessing on you.' Each said this individually, and then they all called it out together. Someone who had been sent by the prince to represent him also called this out; and at that instant the ante-chamber was filled with the fragrant smoke of incense, a sign of blessing from heaven. Then the attendants took the bread from the two tables next to the lamp-stand, and the goblets, which were now full of wine, from the tables in the corners, and gave each guest bread and a goblet; so they ate and drank. After this the husband and wife rose and were followed by the six maidens with silver lamps in their hands, now lit, as far as the threshold. So the married couple entered the bridal chamber, and the door was shut. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #20 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>20. Afterwards the angel took them to the house where the wedding was to take place, and a doorman opened the doors for them. Then shortly, inside the doorway, they were welcomed and greeted by an angel sent by the bridegroom, and they were taken in and escorted to seats reserved for them. Presently, then, they were invited into an anteroom outside the marriage chamber, where they saw a table in the center. On the table stood a magnificent candelabrum with seven branches and cups of gold. Over on the walls hung lampholders of silver, which, once lit, caused the surroundings to appear as though golden. And to the sides of the candelabrum they saw two tables holding cakes placed in three rows, and in the four corners of the room, tables set with crystal goblets.</p><p>[2] While they were looking at these things, suddenly a door opened from a room next to the bridal chamber, and they saw six young women coming out, and behind them the bridegroom and bride, holding each other by the hand and escorting each other to a seat of honor. The seat was placed facing the candelabrum, and they took their places on it, the bridegroom on the left side of the bride, and the bride on his right. And the six young women stood to the side of the seat, next to the bride.<p>The bridegroom was dressed in a glistening purple robe and a tunic of shining linen, with an ephod bearing a gold plaque studded around the edges with diamonds. Engraved on the plaque was a young eaglet, the wedding emblem of that society of heaven. And on his head the bridegroom wore a turban.<p>The bride, moreover, was dressed in a scarlet mantle, and under it an embroidered gown, extending from her neck to her feet, and about the waist she wore a golden cummerbund, and on her head a crown of gold studded with rubies.</p><p>[3] When they were thus seated together, the bridegroom turned to the bride and placed a gold ring on her finger, and taking out bracelets and a necklace of pearls, he fastened the bracelets on her wrists and the necklace around her neck. Then he said, "Accept these tokens." And when she accepted them, he kissed her and said, "Now you are mine," and he called her his wife.<p>This done, the guests cried out, "May there be a blessing!" They each called this out individually, and then all together. One sent by the prince in the prince's stead also called out. And at that moment the room was filled with an aromatic smoke, which was the sign of a blessing from heaven.<p>Then servants in attendance took cakes from the two tables next to the candelabrum, and goblets, now filled with wine, from the tables in the four corners of the room, and they gave each guest a piece of cake and a goblet, and they ate and they drank.<p>Later the husband and his wife arose, followed to the doorway by the six young women carrying silver lamps, which were now lit. And the married couple entered the marriage chamber, and the door was closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #20 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>20. After that the angel led them to the house where the wedding was to be, and a doorman opened the doors. Once over the threshold they were received and greeted by an angel sent from the groom, brought inside, and led to seats that were for them.<p>And presently they were invited into a room outside the bridal suite, where they saw a table in the middle, with a magnificent candle stand on it with seven branches and sconces of gold. Silver lamps hung on the walls. When they were lighted it made the air seem golden. Beside the candle stand they saw two tables with triple rows of bread on them, and in the four corners of the room were tables with crystal cups on them.<p>While they were looking at this a door opened from a room next to the bridal chamber, and they saw six virgins come out, and after them the bride and groom, holding hands and leading each other to a seat placed opposite the candle stand. They sat down there, the groom on the left and the bride on his right, and the six virgins stood beside the seat next to the bride.<p>The groom wore a radiant purple robe and a tunic of shining linen, with an ephod. It had on it a plate of gold set around with diamonds, and on the plate was engraved a young eagle, the wedding insignia of that community in heaven. The groom wore a miter on his head.<p>But the bride wore a scarlet mantle and underneath it an embroidered dress that reached from her neck to her feet, and under her chest a gold belt. And on her head was a crown of gold inset with rubies.<p>When they had sat down together like this, the groom turned to the bride and placed a gold ring on her finger. Then he pulled out bracelets and a necklace of large pearls. He fastened the bracelets on her wrists and the necklace around her neck, and said, "Accept these pledges," and as she accepted he kissed her and said, "Now you are mine," and called her his wife.<p>When this was done the guests cried, "Bless it!" Each cried this by himself, and then all together. The one the prince had sent to represent him also cried out. And in that instant an incense smoke that was a sign of a blessing from heaven filled the room.<p>Then servants took bread from the two tables beside the candle stand and cups now full of wine from the tables in the corners, and they gave each guest his own bread and wine, and they ate and drank. After this the husband and his wife rose up, followed to the threshold by the six virgins with lamps in their hands, now lighted, and the married pair went into the bridal chamber, and the door was closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #20 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>20. After this, the angel conducted them to the house of the nuptials. A porter opened the doors; and within the threshold, they were at once received and saluted by an angel sent by the bridegroom and were brought in and led to the seats assigned them. Soon afterwards they were invited into an ante-room of the bridal chamber. There, in the center, they saw a table on which was set a magnificent golden candlestick, constructed with seven branches with their bowls. On the walls hung silver lamps, and these when lighted made the atmosphere appear as though golden. At the sides of the candlestick, they saw two tables with loaves on them in three rows; and at the four corners of the room were tables on which were crystal cups.</p><p>[2] While they were observing these things, lo, a door opened from a room adjacent to the bridal chamber, and they saw six virgins coming out. After them came the bridegroom and bride holding each other by the hand, and leading each other to a seat placed opposite the candlestick. On this they sat down, the bridegroom on the left and the bride at his right, while the six virgins stood by the side of the seat next to the bride.<p>The bridegroom was clothed in a radiant purple robe and a tunic of shining linen, with an ephod on which was a plate of gold set around with diamonds; and on the plate was engraved a young eagle, the nuptial badge of that society of heaven. On his head, he wore a miter. The bride was clothed with a scarlet mantle, and under that an embroidered gown reaching from the neck to the feet. Below the breast was a golden girdle, and on her head, a crown of gold set with rubies.</p><p>[3] When they were thus seated, the bridegroom turned to the bride and placed on her finger a gold ring. He then drew forth bracelets and a necklace of large pearls, and fastening the bracelets upon her wrists and the necklace around her neck, he said, "Accept these pledges." And as she took them, he kissed her and said, "Now thou art mine"' and he called her his wife. The guests then cried out, first each guest separately and then all together, "Let there be a blessing!" Joining also in the cry was a delegate of the prince who had been sent in his stead; and at that moment the room was filled with an aromatic fragrance, the sign of a blessing from heaven. The attendants then took bread from the two tables beside the candlestick, and cups, now filled with wine, from the tables in the corners and gave to each of the guests his bread and his cup, and they ate and drank. After this, the husband and his wife arose, and the six virgins, holding in their hands the silver lamps now lighted, followed them as far as the threshold, when the married pair entered the bridal chamber and the door was shut. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #20 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>20. The angel thereupon conducted them to the house of the wedding, and a porter opened the doors. They were promptly received inside by an angel representing the bridegroom who greeted them and showed them to the seats intended for them. But presently they were invited into an anteroom of the bridal chamber where they saw, in the center, a table on which a magnificent candlestick stood, made with seven branches and sconces of gold. On the walls hung silver lamps, the light from which turned the air golden. At the sides of the candlestick they saw two tables with loaves in three rows; and in the corners of the room tables on which were cups of crystal.</p><p> [2] While they were gazing at these things, a door opened from a room adjoining the bridal chamber, and they saw six young women come out, and behind them the bridegroom and bride holding each other by the hand. They led each other to a seat placed opposite the candlestick, and sat down, the bridegroom on the left with the bride at his right; while the six young women stood beside the seat near the bride.

<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #20 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>20. Post haec duxit Angelus illos ad Domum nuptiarum, et janitor aperuit fores; et mox intra limen recepti et salutati ab angelo misso a Sponso, ac introducti sunt, et adducti ad sedes pro illis designatas; et mox invitati in Antithalamum, ubi viderunt in medio Mensam, super qua positum erat magnificum Candelabrum instructum septem calamis et schyphis ex auro; et ad parietes pendebant Lychnaria ex argento; ex quibus accensis apparuit athmosphaera sicut aurea: et viderunt ad latera Candelabri binas Mensas, super <sup>1</sup>quibus in triplici ordine repositi erant Panes; et in quatuor angulis Mensas, super quibus erant Cyathi chrystallini.</p><p>[2] Dum illa lustrabant, ecce aperiebatur janua e conclavi juxta thalamum, et viderunt sex Virgines exeuntes, et post illas Sponsum et Sponsam, tenentes se manibus, et ducentes se ad Solium, quod e regione Candelabri positum erat, super quo se reposuerunt, Sponsus ad sinistram, et Sponsa ad dextram ejus, et sex virgines constiterunt ad latus solii juxta Sponsam. Sponsus indutus erat Pallio ex purpura lucente, et Tunica ex bysso splendente, cum Ephodo, super quo erat bractea aurea adamantibus circumobsita; et bracteae insculptus erat Pullus aquilae, insigne nuptiale hujus societatis coeli; et Sponsi caput tegebat cidaris: Sponsa autem amicta erat chlamyde coccinea, et sub illa toga acupicta, continua a collo ad pedes, et sub pectore zona aurea, et super capite corona ex auro cum insitis rubinis.</p><p>[3] Cum ita consederunt, convertit se Sponsus ad Sponsam, ac imposuit digito ejus annulum aureum, et deprompsit armillas et collarium ex unionibus, et alligabat armillas super poplites manuum ejus, et collarium circum collum ejus, et dixit, "accipe haec pignora," et dum illa accepit, osculatus est illam, et dixit, "nunc mea es," et vocavit illam suam uxorem. Hoc facto clamaverunt invitati, "sit Benedictio;" hoc clamavit quisque per se, et dein omnes simul; unus a Principe missus vice ejus etiam acclamavit; et eo momento implebatur Antithalamus ille fumo aromatico, quod erat signum benedictionis e coelo: et tunc ministri ex duabus mensis juxta Candelabrum sumserunt Panes, et ex mensis in angulis Cyathos nunc vino impletos, et dederunt cuivis invitato suum panem et suum cyathum, ac ederunt et biberunt. Post haec surrexerunt Maritus et ejus Uxor, sequentibus sex virginibus cum argenteis nunc accensis lampadibus in manibus usque ad limen; ac Conjuges intraverunt Thalamum, et clausa est janua.<p>@1.
