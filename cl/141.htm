<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第141节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>141、⑵贞洁只适用于一夫一妻的婚姻，或一个男人和一个妻子的婚姻。贞洁只适用于这类婚姻，因为在这些婚姻中，婚姻之爱不再停留于属世人，而是进入属灵人，并逐渐打开通往真正的属灵婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻之路。良善与真理的婚姻是婚姻之爱的源头，并与它建立一个联结。这爱会随着智慧增长而日益深入，随着主在人里面植入教会，这一切便会发生，如我们在前面多次说明的。这在一夫多妻者身上是不可能的，因为他们将婚姻之爱破裂了；婚姻之爱一旦破裂，就和本身为属世之爱的淫乱之爱没什么区别了。有关该主题的详细内容，可见于一夫多妻那一章（332-342节）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>141、（2）贞节只适用于一夫一妻的婚姻，这是因为达种婚姻中的婚姻之爱不是存在于自然人之中，而是存在于精神人之中。这种婚姻会逐渐变成精神的婚姻，及善与真理的结合，这种婚姻是这种爱的来源，它与之形成一种纽带，因为这种爱会随着智慧的增加而出现，这也就是当主在人身上建成了教会的时候。</p><p>这不会存在于一夫多妻的情况中。因为这种情况下婚姻之爱被分割了。这时这种爱与杂乱无章没有区别，它是一种自然的爱，关于这点，在一夫多妻章节中会讲到。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #141 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>141. (ii) Chastity is only attributed to monogamous marriages, that is, between one man and one wife.<p>Chastity can only be attributed to them, because in their case conjugial love does not stay in the natural man, but enters into the spiritual man; and by stages it opens up the way to the spiritual marriage itself, between good and truth, which is its origin, and establishes a link with it. That love enters the more as wisdom increases, and this happens as the church is planted in a person by the Lord, as has been shown at length above. This cannot happen in the case of polygamists, since they divide conjugial love, and when divided it is not very different from sexual love, which is essentially natural. But some interesting details on this subject will be seen in the chapter on polygamy [<a href="332.htm">332-342</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #141 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>141. 2. Chastity is ascribed only to monogamous marriages, or to marriages of one man with one wife. Chastity is ascribed only to such marriages because conjugial love in these marriages does not lie in the natural self, but enters into the spiritual self and gradually opens its way to the real spiritual marriage, which is a marriage of good and truth. This marriage is the origin of the love, and it forms a bond with it. For such a love enters as wisdom increases, and this takes place as the church is implanted by the Lord, as we have shown many times before.<p>This cannot happen in the case of polygamists, since they divide conjugial love, and when this love is a divided one it is not much different from promiscuous love, which in itself is a natural love. But on this subject, some important points will be seen in the chapter on polygamy. <sup >1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="332.htm">332</a> ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #141 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>141. 2. "Chaste" applies only to monogamous marriages, or marriage of one man with one wife. Chaste applies only to these marriages because married love for them is not seated in the worldly plane of the person but reaches into the spiritual, and it gradually opens a way for itself to spiritual marriage itself - the marriage of good and truth - which is its source. It joins itself with that. Married love comes in as wisdom increases, and this happens as the Lord implants religion, as already demonstrated in many places. This cannot happen to polygamists, since they split married love, and when it is divided this love is not unlike sexual love, which is worldly in its own right. But something applicable to this subject appears in the discussion of polygamy later. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #141 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>141. II. THAT THE CHASTE IS PREDICATED ONLY OF MONOGAMOUS MARRIAGES, OR THOSE OF ONE MAN WITH ONE WIFE. That the chaste is predicated of these only, is because with them conjugial love does not reside in the natural man but enters into the spiritual and successively opens for itself a way to the spiritual marriage, being the marriage of good and truth, which is its origin and with which it conjoins itself; for that love enters according to the increase of wisdom, and, as previously shown in many places, this is according to the implantation of the Church by the Lord. The Church cannot be implanted with polygamists because they divide conjugial love, and when divided, this love is not unlike love of the sex which in itself is natural. But on this subject, something worthy of note will be seen in the chapter on Polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #141 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>141. (ii) The chaste is predicable only of monogamous marriages, or marriages of one man with one wife. The chaste is predicable only of these marriages because in them marital love does not reside in the natural man, but enters the spiritual, and gradually makes its way to the spiritual marriage of good and truth, which is its origin, and merges with it. For marital love comes with the growth of wisdom, and this growth, as we have shown many times, is according to the implantation of the Church by the Lord. With the polygamous, no such thing takes place, for they divide marital love, and this love divided, is not unlike sexual love, which in itself is natural. But on this subject some things worthy of attention will be seen when we discuss polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #141 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>141. (2) That chaste is predicated only of monogamous marriages, or those of one man with one wife. The reason why chaste is predicated only of these marriages is that with them conjugial love resides not in the natural man, but penetrates to the spiritual, and opens a way for itself successively to the very spiritual marriage - that of good and truth - which is its origin, and with which it conjoins itself. For that love enters in according to the increments of wisdom, and this is according to the implantation of the church by the Lord, as has been shown many times before. This cannot be done with polygamists, because they divide conjugial love, and this love divided is not unlike the love of the sex, which in itself is natural. But some things appropriate to this subject will be seen in the chapter on Polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #141 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>141. II: Quod Castum modo praedicetur de Conjugiis monogamicis, seu unius Viri cum una Uxore. Quod Castum praedicetur de illis solis, est quia Amor conjugialis apud illos non residet in Naturali homine, sed intrat in Spiritualem, et successive aperit sibi viam ad ipsum Conjugium spirituale, quod est boni et veri, quod est origo ejus, et se cum illo conjungit; intrat enim ille Amor secundum incrementa sapientiae, et haec secundum implantationem Ecclesiae a Domino, ut prius multis ostensum est. Hoc non potest fieri apud Polygamos, quoniam hi dividunt Amorem conjugialem, et hic Amor divisus non absimilis est Amori sexus, qui in se est naturalis; sed de hoc aliqua digna videbuntur in Transactione de Polygamia. </p>
