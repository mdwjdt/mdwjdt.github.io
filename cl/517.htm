<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第517节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>517、由于对属灵婚姻的侵犯就是对圣言的侵犯，故显而易见，这种侵犯就是对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲；因为属灵婚姻是良善与真理的婚姻，如前所述。由此可知，当圣言的良善被玷污，圣言的真理被歪曲时，该婚姻就遭到侵犯。我们从下文在某种程度上清楚可知，这种侵犯是如何发生的，在谁手上犯下的。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>517、因为对精神性婚姻的侵犯就是对《圣经》的侵犯，很明显，这种侵犯就是对善和真理的亵渎。因为我们说过精神性的婚姻就是善与真理的结合，这种侵犯是怎样产生的，又是由谁造成的将在下文中讲到。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #517 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>517. So since the violation of the spiritual marriage is the violation of the Word, it is obvious that this violation consists in the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth; for the spiritual marriage is a marriage of good and truth, as has been said. The consequence of this is that, when the good of the Word is adulterated and the truth of the Word is falsified, that marriage is violated. It is to some extent clear from what follows how this violation takes place and at whose hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #517 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>517. Since violation of the spiritual marriage is thus a violation of the Word, it is apparent that this violation is an adulteration of good and falsification of truth. For the spiritual marriage is, as we said, a marriage of good and truth. It follows, therefore, that when good is adulterated and the truth of the Word falsified, this marriage is violated. How such a violation is committed and by whom will be apparent in some measure from the observations which follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #517 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>517. So, since violation of spiritual marriage is violation of the Word, it is clear that this violation is adulteration of good and falsification of truth. For spiritual marriage is marriage of good and truth, as was said. Consequently, adulterating the good and falsifying the truth of the Word violates that marriage. Who does this violence, and how, will be fairly clear from the remarks that follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #517 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>517. Since, therefore, the violation of spiritual marriage is the violation of the Word, it is evident that this violation is the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth - spiritual marriage, as was said, being the marriage of good and truth. It follows from this, that when the good of the Word is adulterated and the truth of the Word falsified, this marriage is violated. How the violation is committed, and by whom, will be evident to some extent from what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #517 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>517. Since violation of the spiritual marriage, therefore, is violation of the Word, it is plain that it consists in adulteration of good and falsification of truth (the spiritual marriage being, as was said, one of good and truth). It follows that when good is adulterated and the truth of the Word falsified, this marriage is violated. It is plain in some degree from what follows how the violation is committed and by whom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #517 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>517. Since, therefore, the violation of the spiritual marriage is the violation of the Word, it is plain that this violation is the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth; for the spiritual marriage is the marriage of good and truth, as has been said. It follows from this that when the good of the Word is adulterated and the truth of the Word is falsified, that marriage is violated. How that violation is committed, and by whom, will to some degree be evident from what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #517 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>517. Cum itaque violatio conjugii spiritualis est violatio Verbi, patet quod haec violatio sit adulteratio boni et falsificatio veri; conjugium enim spirituale est conjugium boni et veri, ut dictum est; inde consequitur, quod dum adulteratur bonum et falsificatur verum Verbi, illud Conjugium violetur; quae violatio quomodo fit et a quibus, ex his quae subsequuntur, aliquantisper patet. </p>
