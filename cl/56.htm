<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第56节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>56、记事二：<br><br>有一次，我在灵人界与天使交谈时，心中升起非常强烈的渴望，想看看以前只见过一次的智慧圣殿。我向他们打听路。他们说：<br><br>“跟着光走，就会找到它。”<br><br>“‘跟着光走’是什么意思？”<br><br>“越接近智慧圣殿，我们的光就越强烈。所以，要朝着更明亮的方向走。因为我们的光是从显为太阳的主发出的，它本身就是智慧。”<br><br>在两位天使的陪同下，我顺着亮光逐渐强烈的方向走，沿着陡峭的山路爬上南部地区的小山顶，只见那里有一个蔚为壮观的大门。守卫看到天使和我之后，就打开大门，我看到一条两侧栽有棕榈和月桂树的林荫路，我们沿着它向前走。这条林荫路蜿蜒曲折，尽头是一个花园，花园中间矗立着一座智慧圣殿。我环顾花园四周，发现有一些和圣殿一模一样的小型建筑，里面住着智者。我们走近其中一个建筑，在门口与东道主搭话，告诉他我们此行的原由和到来的方式。于是，他说：“欢迎光临，请进来坐，我们一起畅谈智慧。”<br><br>我看到房子内部被一分为二，但仍是一个。它被一个透明隔板一分为二，但看似一个，因为隔板极其透亮，仿佛由最纯净的水晶制成。我问为何这样布置。他说：“我不是独自一人。我的妻子和我在一起。我们是两个人，然而不是两个，而是一体。”我说：“我知道你是一位智者，但智者或智慧和女人有什么关系？”听到这话，我们的东道主面有愠色，他伸出手来，看哪，隔壁房间的其他智者出现了。他开玩笑似地对这些智者说：“新来的人到我们这里来学习的目的，居然是为了问智者或智慧与女人有什么关系？”闻听此言，他们全都笑了，说：“没有女人，即没有爱的智者或智慧算什么？妻子就是对智者的智慧之爱。”<br><br>我们的东道主接着说：“让我们开启一段智慧的对话吧。谈论的主题是原因，就从女性美丽的原因开始谈起吧。”于是，他们轮流发言。第一位说：“原因是，主将女人创造为对男人智慧的情感，对智慧的情感就是美丽的化身。”第二位说：“原因是，主通过男人的智慧创造了女人。由于女人通过男人被造，所以她是被爱之情感所激发的一个智慧形式。爱之情感既是真正的生命，那女人就是智慧的生命。男性是智慧，智慧的生命就是美丽的化身。”第三位说：“原因是，女人被赋予对婚姻之爱的快乐感知。由于她们的身体整个就是这种感知的器官，所以婚姻之爱的快乐居所及其感知必是一个美丽的形式。”<br><br>第四位说：“原因是，主将生命的美丽和优雅从男人身上取出，将其注入女人里面。所以，男人若不与他在女人里面的美丽与优雅重新结合，就显得冷酷严厉、枯燥乏味。他也是不明智的，只为自己而活，因而是愚蠢的。但当男人与他在妻子里面的生命的美丽和优雅结合起来时，就会变得令人愉悦、富有魅力、活泼可爱，因而是明智的。”第五位说：“原因是，女人被造为美丽的化身，并非为了她们自己，而是为了男人，以使得原本坚硬的男人能变得柔软，原本严厉的秉性能变得和善，原本冷酷的心肠能变得温暖。当他们与自己的妻子合为一体后，就会变得如此。”<br><br>第六位说：“原因是，宇宙是主所造的最完美的作品。但其中没有一物的完美能比得上女人的可爱脸庞和得体举止。这是为了让男人能为这样的慷慨赠与而感谢主，并通过从主接受智慧而回报这种馈赠。”这些及很多类似观点表述完毕，只见一位妻子透过水晶隔板显现出来，她对自己的丈夫说：“若你愿意，请说说吧。”当丈夫发言时，我们能感觉到他的话里有出自其妻子的智慧生命，因为妻子的爱就体现在他的语气中。因此，经验印证了这个真理。后来，我们参观了智慧圣殿和它周边的花园。于是，我们满怀喜悦地离开，穿过林荫路来到大门口，沿着我们来时的路下来了。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>56、第二点要说的是：</p><p>有一次在精神世界中的天使们讲话时我非常想看一下我从前只见过一次的智慧之殿。于是我问天使们怎么能到那里。</p><p>他们说：“跟着光走，你就会找到它。”</p><p>我问道：“什么是跟着光走？”</p><p>他们说：“我们的光越接近智慧之殿就越明亮。朝着更明亮的方向走。</p><p>因为我们的光来自于主，它是这个世界的太阳，这种光是智慧之光。”</p><p>在两个天使的陪同下，我朝着明亮的地方走。走过一段陡峭的路我来到南部的一座山顶，在那有一个壮观的大门。卫从们见到天使和我后将门打开。只见面前是一个两边有棕榈和月桂树的大路。路的尽头转弯处是一个花园，在花园中就是智慧之殿。</p><p>我在花园中参观时看到了一些小些的建筑物。比智慧之殿小但形状一样。里面是有智慧的人。我走到一个小屋里跟接待说明来由。接待说：“欢迎光临，请坐，让我们谈谈。”</p><p>我看到这个房子内部分成两部分，但仍是一个房子。它是由一个透明的隔板分开的，看上去还像是一个房间，这个隔板就像是最纯的水晶一样透明，我问道为什么是这样的布局。</p><p>接待说：“我不是一个人在这，我妻子也在，尽管我们是两个人，我们同时又是一个躯体。”</p><p>我回答道：“我知道你是智者，但智者或者是智慧与女人有什么关系？</p><p>听到这里，接待有些不高兴。他伸出手，突然间房边房子里的智者都来了。</p><p>他对来的人说：“我们的客人想要知道智者或是智慧与女人有什么关系！”</p><p>来的人微笑着说道：“没有女人或者没有爱的智者或者智慧是什么呢？”妻子是智者的爱。</p><p>接待说道：“我们来谈谈吧，谈谈女性的美的原因。”</p><p>在座的依次发言。第一个说，主创造了女人，使得女人爱男人的智慧。对智慧的爱本身就是一种美。</p><p>第二个说话的人说，主通过男人的智慧而造的女人，因为她来自于男人，她是在爱的启发下的智慧的一种形式。因为爱就是生命，女人就是在智慧中的一种生命形式。男人是智慧的一种形式。智慧中的生命本身就是一种美。</p><p>第三个智者阐述了他的理由。他说女人生来能体会到婚姻之爱中的快乐。女人的躯体是一种媒体，是婚姻之爱的载体，这本身就是一种美。</p><p>第四个智者说了他的理由。主将美和优雅从男人身上拿出来转移到女人身上。这就是为什么没有与自身的美和优雅（即女人）相结合的男人体显得冷酷，严肃没有吸引力，并有些愚笨。另一方面，若男人与他的妻子相结合，即与他自己的美和优雅相结合，他会显得更易相处，友好、更明智。</p><p>第五个讲了他的理由。女人在创世时就拥有美丽，但不是为了她们自己，而是为了使男人的粗糙外表变得柔和些，使男人的严肃形象变得可亲些，使男人的硬心肠变得温和些。与他的妻子结合后，男人就会产生以上变化。</p><p>第六个人给出了他的理由。主创造了完美的世界，但没有比女人的外表和行为更完美的了。使得男人能够为有这样一个礼物而感谢主，并且接受来自于主的智慧。</p><p>又有几个人阐述了类似的理由，这时有一个妻子从水晶般的隔板后出来，他对他的丈夫说：“你说一说吧。”</p><p>当他讲话时，话语中流露出来自于他的妻子的智慧的生命。这证实了前面所说的事实。</p><p>这之后我看了看智慧之殿及乐园中的其它东西。怀着愉快的心情我们沿着那条路去了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #56 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>56. A second experience.<p>I was once talking with angels in the spiritual world when I was filled with a delightful longing to see the Temple of Wisdom, which I had visited once before. I asked them the way to it, and they replied, 'Follow the light and you will find it.' 'What do you mean,' I said, 'by following the light?' 'Our light,' they said, 'gets more and more brilliant, the closer you come to that temple. So follow the light as its brilliance increases. Our light comes from the Lord as a sun, so regarded in essence it is wisdom.'<p>Then accompanied by two angels I went towards the increasing light, climbing by a sloping path to the top of a hill in the southern region. There was a magnificent gateway there, and on seeing the angels with me the porter opened it. Inside we saw an arcade made of palms and laurels, along which we walked. It led us in a curve and ended in a garden, in the middle of which was the Temple of Wisdom. Arriving there I looked around and saw small buildings resembling the temple, each containing a wise man. We went up to one, and on the door-step spoke with our host, explaining why we had come and how we had arrived there. 'You are welcome,' said our host, 'come in and sit down and let us engage in wise conversation.'</p><p>[2] On looking into the building I saw it was divided into two, though still one. It was cut in half by a transparent wall, but being of the purest crystal its transparency made the room appear to be one. I asked why this was.<p>'I am not alone,' he said, 'my wife is with me, and though we are two, we are still not two, but one flesh.' 'I know,' I said. 'that you are wise; but what has a wise man or wisdom to do with a woman?' At this our host's face dropped in some show of annoyance, and he held out his hand. At once other wise men came from the nearest buildings, to whom he said in a joking manner, 'Our guest here asked the question, "What has a wise man or wisdom to do with a woman?"' This provoked general laughter, and they said, 'What is a wise man or wisdom without a woman, or without love? A wife is the love of a man's wisdom.'</p><p>[3] 'Let us have a wise conversation,' our host said, 'on the subject of causation, beginning with the cause of the beauty of the female sex.' So they took turns to speak. The first said that the reason was that women were created by the Lord as affections for the wisdom of men, and the affection for wisdom is the height of beauty.<p>The second said the reason was that woman was created by the Lord by means of a man's wisdom, being created from a man, so that she is a form of wisdom inspired by the affection of love. And since the affection of love is really life, a woman is the life of wisdom, but the male is wisdom, and the life of wisdom is the height of beauty.<p>The third said that the reason was that women have been endowed with a feeling for the delights of conjugial love, and since their whole body is an organ of this feeling, it must inevitably be that, where the delights of conjugial love reside and are felt, there is beauty.</p><p>[4] The fourth said the reason was that the Lord took the beauty and elegance of life from man and placed it in woman. So a man, unless reunited with his beauty and elegance in a woman, is grim, stern, dry and unlovable. He is not wise, except to himself, which makes him insensitive. But when a man is united with his beauty and elegance of life in a wife, he becomes pleasant, charming, lively and loveable, and so is wise.<p>The fifth said that the reason was that women were created as models of beauty, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of men, so that men, being of themselves hard, should be softened, their characters, being of themselves serious, should be made mild, and their hearts, being of themselves cold, should grow warm. This is what happens to them, when they become one flesh with their wives.</p><p>[5] The sixth said the reason was that the universe was created by the Lord as the most perfect work. But nothing more perfect was created in it than a woman with a lovely face and proper manners. This was to make men thank the Lord for that act of munificence, and repay it by receiving wisdom from Him.<p>When these and many similar opinions had been expressed, his wife was seen through the crystal wall. She said to her husband, 'Please speak.' While he spoke, we could perceive in his words the life of wisdom coming from his wife, for her love was present in the sound of his speech. So experience bore witness to this truth.<p>Afterwards we visited the Temple of Wisdom and the gardens surrounding it. So we went away full of joy, passing through the arcade to the gateway, and went down by the way by which we had come up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #56 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>56. The second account:<p>One time, while speaking with angels in the spiritual world, I was filled with a pleasant wish to see the Temple of Wisdom, which I had seen once before. <sup >1</sup>So I asked the angels about the way to it.<p>They said, "Follow the light, and you will find it."<p>And I said, "What do you mean, follow the light?"<p>They said, "Our light grows brighter the closer we get to that temple. Follow the light, therefore, in the direction it grows brighter. For our light emanates from the Lord as the sun of this world, and so, regarded in itself, that light is wisdom."<p>In the company of two angels I then went in the direction that the light grew brighter, and I ascended by a steep path to the top of a certain hill which was in the southern zone, where I found a magnificent gate. When the guard saw the angels with me, he opened it, and behold, I saw an avenue of palm trees and laurels, which we followed. The avenue curved around and ended up at a garden, in the middle of which stood the Temple of Wisdom.<p>As I looked around in the garden, I saw some smaller buildings, replicas of the temple, with wise men in them. We went over to one of the buildings, and we spoke at the entrance with the receptionist there, telling him the reason for our coming and the way we had arrived. And the receptionist said, "Welcome! Come in, have a seat, and let us spend some time together in conversations of wisdom."</p><p>[2] I saw inside that the building was divided into two sections, and yet the two were still one. It was divided into two sections by a transparent partition, but it looked like one room because of the partition's transparency, which was like the transparency of the purest crystal. I asked why it was arranged like that.<p>The receptionist said, "I am not alone. My wife is with me, and though we are two, yet we are not two but one flesh."<p>To which I replied, "I know you are wise, but what does a wise man or wisdom have to do with a woman?"<p>At this, with some feeling of annoyance, the receptionist's expression changed, and he stretched out his hand, and suddenly, then, other wise men were present from the neighboring buildings. To them he said with amusement, "Our visitor here says he wants to know what a wise man or wisdom has to do with a woman!"<p>They all laughed at this and said, "What is a wise man or wisdom apart from a woman or apart from love? A wife is the love of a wise man's wisdom."</p><p>[3] But the receptionist said, "Let us join together now in some conversation of wisdom. Let the conversation be about causes, today the reason for the beauty in the female sex."<p>So they then spoke in turn. And the first speaker gave this reason, that women were created by the Lord to be forms of affection for the wisdom in men, and affection for wisdom is beauty itself.<p>The second speaker gave this reason, that woman was created by the Lord through the wisdom in man, because she was created from man, and that she is therefore a form of wisdom inspired by the affection of love. And because the affection of love is life itself, a woman is a form of the life in wisdom, while the male is a form of wisdom, and the life in wisdom is beauty itself.<p>The third speaker presented this reason, that women have been given a perception of the delights in conjugial love. And because their whole body is an instrument of that perception, the abode where the delights of conjugial love dwell with their perception cannot help but be a form of beauty.</p><p>[4] The fourth speaker gave this reason, that the Lord took beauty and grace of life from man and transferred them into woman, and that is why a man not reunited with his beauty and grace in woman is stern, severe, dry and unattractive, and also not wise except for his own sake alone, in which case he is a dunce. On the other hand, when a man is united with his beauty and grace of life in a wife, he becomes agreeable, pleasant, full of life and lovable, and therefore wise.<p>The fifth speaker gave this reason, that women were created to be beauties, not for their own sake, but for the sake of men, so that men's natural hardness might become softer, the natural solemnness of their dispositions more amiable, and the natural coldness of their hearts warmer. And this is what happens to them when they become one flesh with their wives.</p><p>[5] The sixth speaker offered this reason, that the universe created by the Lord is a most perfect work, but nothing is created in it more perfect than a woman attractive in appearance and becoming in behavior, in order that a man may thank the Lord for such a gift and repay it by receiving wisdom from Him.<p>After these and several other similar views were expressed, one of the wives appeared through the crystal-like partition, and she said to her husband, "Speak, if you wish."<p>And when he spoke, the life in his wisdom from his wife was perceived in his speech, for her love was in the tone of his voice. Thus did experience bear witness to the truth expressed.<p>After this we looked at the Temple of Wisdom, and also at the things in the paradise surrounding it. And being filled with feelings of joy on account of them, we departed and went along the avenue to the gate, and so descended by the way we had come.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="../ar/875.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed, no. 875 [4-8]</a> (first published in Amsterdam, 1766). </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #56 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>56. The second story: Talking with angels in the world of spirits one time, I was inspired with a happy wish to see the Temple of Wisdom, which I had seen once before, and I asked them how to get there. They said, "Follow the light and you will come to it."<p>I said, "What do you mean, 'Follow the light'?"<p>They said, "Our light shines brighter and brighter as you approach that temple, so head for where the light becomes brighter.<p>Our light comes from the Lord as a Sun, seen for what it is.<p>Therefore, it is wisdom."<p>Then, together with two angels, I walked on according to the increasing brightness of light and went up by a steep path all the way to the top of a hill in the southern quadrant, and there was a magnificent gate. The keeper saw the angels with me and opened it. Sure enough, we saw an avenue of palm and laurel trees, which we followed. The avenue curved around and ended in a garden with the Temple of Wisdom in the middle.<p>As I looked around I saw little chapels like the temple, with wise men in them. We went to one temple and spoke with the host there at the entrance, and told him why and how we came.<p>"Welcome!" he said. "Come in! Sit down! Let's visit and talk about wisdom."<p>I could see that the inside of the chapel was divided in two but was still one room. It was divided by a transparent wall, but it seemed like one room because of the transparency, which was like the purest crystal.<p>"Why is it like this?" I asked.<p>"I am not alone," he said. "My wife is with me, and we are two, but still we are not two but one flesh."<p>I said, "I know you are a wise man. What does a wise man, or wisdom, have to do with a woman?"<p>Some displeasure at this came over our host's face. He held his hand out, and we saw other wise men coming from the neighboring buildings. "Our guest here," he teased, "wants to know<p>'What does a wise man, or wisdom, have to do with a woman?'"<p>Everyone laughed at this and said, "What is a wise man or wisdom without a woman - or without love? A wife is love of a wise man's wisdom."<p>But the host said, "Now let's visit with some conversation about wisdom. Let's talk about reasons - right now, the reason for the feminine sex's beauty."<p>Then, one after the other, they spoke.<p>The first one said, "Here's why: The Lord created women to be an affection for men's wisdom, and an affection for wisdom is beauty itself."<p>The second said, "This is why: The Lord created woman through the wisdom of man because He created her from man, and therefore she is the embodiment of wisdom inspired with a feeling of love, and a feeling of love is life itself, so woman is the life of wisdom (though the male is wisdom), and the life of wisdom is beauty itself."<p>The third said, "Here's why: Women can feel the joys of love for marriage, and their whole body is an organ of this perception, so beauty is precisely home for the joys of married love, with its perception."<p>The fourth gave this reason: "The Lord took the beauty and refinement of life from man and assigned it to woman, so without a reunion with life's beauty and refinement in a woman, a man is wild, rigid, dry, and repulsive, and he is not wise except for his own benefit, which is stupidity. But when a man unites with his life's beauty and refinement in a wife, he becomes happy, friendly, lively, and lovable, and in this way wise."<p>The fifth gave this reason: "Women are not created beautiful for themselves but for men - to soften up men's own harshness, mellow their serious intellects, and warm their cold hearts. And this is what happens when men make one flesh with their wives."<p>The sixth gave this reason: "The universe the Lord created is a most perfect product. And nothing created is more perfect than a woman with a beautiful face and nice manners. This makes a man thank the Lord for His generosity and repay it by accepting wisdom from Him."<p>After these things and many more like them had been said, the man's wife appeared through the crystal partition and said to her husband, "Please say something." And when he spoke you could notice in his conversation the vitality of his wisdom from his wife, for her love was in the tone of his voice. This experience showed that those things were true.<p>After this we looked the Temple of Wisdom over, and also the garden paradise around it, and, filled with the happiness of it, we left, took the avenue to the gate, and went down by the path we came up on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #56 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>56. The Second Memorable Relation:<p>Once, while talking with angels in the world of spirits, I was inspired with a pleasant desire to see the Temple of Wisdom which I had seen once before; <sup >1</sup>and I asked them the way. They said, "Follow the light and you will find it." I said, "What do you mean by "Follow the light"?" and they said: "Our light shines more and more brightly as we draw nearer to that temple. Therefore, follow the light according to the increase of its brightness; for our light proceeds from the Lord as a Sun, and hence, considered in itself, is wisdom."<p>Then, walking in company with two angels, I followed the increasing brightness of the light and ascended by a steep path to the summit of a hill which lay in the southern quarter. There was a magnificent gate there. Seeing the angels with me, the keeper opened it and, lo, there was seen an avenue of palm trees and laurels, and along this we walked. It was a winding avenue and terminated in a garden in the midst of which was the TEMPLE OF WISDOM. As I looked around me, I saw also small buildings, similar to the temple, and in them were wise men. We approached one of these buildings and, at the entrance, spoke to the host there and told him the reason of our coming and the manner of our approach. He then said, "Welcome; come in; be seated and let us join together in discourse on wisdom.:</p><p>[2] Within the house, I saw that it was divided into two and yet was one. It was divided into two by a transparent partition; and it seemed to be one because of the transparency of the partition which was as though of purest crystal. I asked why this was the case. He said, "I am not alone. My wife is with me; and we are two and yet not two but one flesh."<p>I then said, "I know that you are a wise man, but what has a wise man or wisdom to do with woman?" At this our host, with some indignation, changed countenance. He then stretched out his hand and, lo, from neighboring houses other wise men were present. To these, he said jestingly, "Our new-comer here, for the purpose of learning, asks what a wise man or wisdom has to do with woman?" At this they all laughed and said, "What is a wise man or wisdom without woman, that is, without love? The wife is the love of a wise man's wisdom."</p><p>[3] Our host then said, "Let us now join together in some discourse on wisdom. Let the discourse be concerning causes, and for the present concerning the cause of the beauty of the female sex." They then spoke in turn. The first gave this as the cause: "Women were created, by the Lord, affections of the wisdom of men; and the affection of wisdom is beauty itself." A second gave this: "Woman was created by the Lord through the wisdom of man because from man. Hence, being a form of wisdom inspired with the affection of love, and the affection of love being life itself, woman is the life of wisdom. The male is wisdom, and the life of wisdom is beauty." A third gave this: "To women is given a perception of the delights of conjugial love; and because their whole body is an organ of that perception, it cannot be otherwise than that the abode of the delights of conjugial love with its perception is beauty."</p><p>[4] A fourth gave this: "The Lord has taken the beauty and grace of life from man and transcribed them into woman. Hence, without reunion with his beauty and grace in woman, a man is stern, austere, dry, and unlovely; nor is he wise save for himself alone, and then he is stupid. But when man is united with his beauty and grace of life in his wife, he becomes agreeable, pleasant, animated, and lovely, and thus wise." A fifth gave this: "Women are created beauties for the sake not of themselves but of men, that men, of themselves hard, may be softened; that their minds, of themselves severe, may become mild, and their hearts, of themselves cold, warm; and they do become such when they become one flesh with their wives."</p><p>[5] A sixth gave this: "The universe was created by the Lord a most perfect work; but in that universe nothing was created more perfect than woman, beautiful in face and graceful in manners; and this to the end that man may render thanks to the Lord for this bounty, and may repay it by the reception of wisdom from Him.<p>After these and many like sentiments had been expressed, the wife appeared through the crystal partition and said to her husband, "Speak, if you please." And when he spoke, the life of wisdom from his wife was perceived in his speech; for her love was in the tone of his voice. Thus experience bore witness to truth.<p>After this we examined the Temple of wisdom, and also its paradisal surroundings, and then, filled thereby with joy, we departed, and, passing through the avenue to the gate, went down by the way we had come.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See APOCALYPSE REVEALED (published in 1766), n. <a href="../ar/875.htm">875</a>; the present work was published in 1768. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #56 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>56. II<p>Talking with angels on a time in the spiritual world, I was inspired with a pleasant desire to see the Temple of Wisdom which I had seen once before. asked them the way to it. They replied,<p>"Follow the light and you will come to it."<p>I said, "How do you mean, 'Follow the light'?"<p>"Our light grows brighter and brighter," said they, "as we approach the temple. Follow the light, therefore, as it increases in brightness. Our light proceeds from the Lord as a Sun and therefore considered in itself is wisdom."<p>In company with two of the angels I walked on, following the increasing brightness of the light, and ascended by a steep path to the very top of a hill which lay in the southern quarter, where I came to a magnificent gate.<p>Seeing the angels with me, the guard opened the gate, and an avenue of palms and laurels appeared, along which we proceeded. The avenue wound about and ended at a garden in the midst of which was the Temple of Wisdom.<p>I looked around me and saw some small buildings, replicas of the temple, wherein were wise men. We approached one of the buildings, and at the entrance spoke to the host there, and told the reason of our coming, and how we came. He replied,<p>"Welcome! Come in; be seated. Let us join in discourses of wisdom."</p><p>[2] I saw that the house was divided in two inside and yet was one. It was bisected by a transparent partition; it seemed like a single room because the transparence was like that of the purest crystal. I asked why the room was so arranged.<p>"I am not alone," he said, "my wife is with me. We are two and yet not two, but one flesh."<p>I said: "I know that you are a wise man; what has a wise man or wisdom to do with a woman?" At this our host in some indignation changed expression. He stretched out his hand, and immediately other wise men were present from neighboring houses, to whom he said jocosely,<p>"Our newcomer here wants to know, 'What has a wise man or wisdom to do with a woman?'"<p>They all laughed at this, and said, "What is a wise man or wisdom apart from a woman or without love? A wife is the love of a wise man's wisdom."</p><p>[3] But the host said, "Now let us engage in some conversation of wisdom. Let us converse about causes; and first, about the cause of the beauty of the female sex." Then they spoke in turn. The first gave this cause: women were created by the Lord affections of the wisdom of men, and the affection of wisdom is beauty itself. The second assigned this cause: woman was created by the Lord through the wisdom of man because from man; she is therefore a form of wisdom inspired with the affection of love; as the affection of love is life itself, woman is the life of wisdom, while the male is wisdom; and the life of wisdom is beauty itself. The third mentioned this cause: woman is given a perception of the delights of marital love, and her whole body is an organ of that perception; the habitation both of the delights of marital love and of the perception of them is beauty.</p><p>[4] The fourth named this cause: the Lord has taken life's beauty and grace from man and transcribed them on woman; hence without reunion with this beauty and grace in woman, man is stern, austere, uninspired and unlovely; nor is he wise unless for himself alone, and such a one is foolish; but when man is united with this beauty and grace of life in a wife, he becomes agreeable, pleasant, animated and lovely, and thus wise. The fifth mentioned this cause: women are created beauties not for their own sake but for men; in order that men, of themselves hard, may be softened; their dispositions, of themselves severe, may become gentle; and their hearts, of themselves cold, may become warm; such they do become when they become one flesh with their wives.</p><p>[5] The sixth gave this cause: the universe was created by the Lord a most perfect work; but nothing in it was created more perfect than woman, beautiful of face and charming in her ways, to the end that man may render thanks to the Lord for this bountiful gift and repay it by the reception of wisdom from Him.<p>After these and many such things had been said, the wife appeared through the crystal partition and said to her husband, "Speak, if you please." As he spoke, the life of wisdom from the wife was perceived in his speech; for the love of it was in the tone of his voice. Thus did experience bear witness to that truth.<p>Afterwards we viewed the Temple of Wisdom and the surrounding paradise, too, and filled thereby with joy we took our leave, followed the avenue to the gate, and descended by the way we had come. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #56 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>56. The Second Relation:<p>Once while talking with angels in the world of spirits I was inspired with a pleasing desire to see the Temple of Wisdom which I had seen once before; and I asked them the way to it. They said:<p>'Follow the light and you will find it.' I said, 'What do you mean by, Follow the light?'<p>They said, 'Our light shines more and more brightly as we approach that temple. Therefore follow the light according to the increase of its brightness; for our light proceeds from the Lord as a Sun and therefore, considered in itself is wisdom.'<p>Then in company with two angels I walked on, following the increasing brightness of the light, and ascended by a steep path to the summit of a hill which lay in the southern quarter, where there was a magnificent gate.<p>And the keeper seeing the angels with me opened the gate, and lo! there appeared an avenue of palm and laurel trees along which we walked. It was a winding avenue and terminated in a garden in the midst of which was the Temple of Wisdom.<p>As I looked around me there I saw smaller buildings, similitudes of the temple, wherein were wise men. We approached one of them, and at the entrance spoke to the one who dwelt there, and told him the reason of our coming, and how we came. And the host said:<p>'Welcome! come in; be seated; and let us join in discourses of wisdom.' I observed that the house within was divided into two and yet was one. It was divided into two by a translucid partition; and it appeared as one by reason of its translucency which was as of the purest crystal. I asked why it was so? He said:<p>‘I am not alone. My wife is with me; and we are two and yet not two but one flesh.'<p>And I said: ‘I know that you are a wise man, and what has a wise man or wisdom to do with a woman?' At this our host with a certain indignation changed countenance. And he put forth his hand, and lo! immediately other wise men were present from neighboring houses, to whom he playfully said:<p>'Our new-comer here says inquiringly, 'What has a wise man or wisdom to do with a woman?''<p>They all smiled at this, and said: 'What is a wise man or wisdom without a woman, or without love? The wife is the love of a wise man's wisdom.'<p>But the host said, 'Now let us join in some conversation of wisdom. Let the conversation be respecting causes; and first, about the cause of the beauty of the female sex.' And then they spoke in succession. The first gave this cause: That women were created by the Lord affections of the wisdom of men; and the affection of wisdom is beauty itself. Another mentioned this: That woman was created of the Lord through the wisdom of the man because from the man; and therefore, she is a form of wisdom inspired with the affection of love; and as the affection of love is life itself, woman is the life of wisdom; but the male is wisdom and the life of wisdom is beauty itself. The third mentioned this cause: That to women is given the perception of the delights of conjugial love; and as their whole body is an organ of that perception it cannot but be that the habitation of the delights of conjugial love with their perception is beauty. The fourth mentioned this cause: That the Lord has taken the beauty and grace of life from the man and transcribed them into the woman; and for this reason the man without reunition with his own beauty and grace in woman is stern, austere, dry, and unlovely; and is not wise unless for himself alone and such a one is foolish. But when the man is united with his beauty and grace of life in the wife, he becomes agreeable, pleasant, animated, and lovely and thus wise. The fifth mentioned this cause: That women are created beauties not for their own sake but for men; that men, of themselves hard, may be softened; that their dispositions, of themselves severe, may become gentle; and their hearts, of themselves cold, may become warm. And such they do become when they become one flesh with their wives. The sixth mentioned this cause: The universe was created by the Lord a most perfect work; but nothing more perfect was created therein than woman, beautiful in countenance and charming in manner, to the end that the man may render thanks to the Lord for this bountiful gift, and repay it by the reception of wisdom from Him.<p>After these and many such things had been said, the wife appeared through the crystal partition, and said to her husband, 'Speak, if you please.' And as he spoke, the life of wisdom from the wife was perceived in his speech; for the love of it was in the tone of his voice. Thus did experience bear witness to that truth.<p>Afterwards we viewed the Temple of Wisdom, and also the scenes of the surrounding paradise, and filled thereby with joy we took our leave, passed through the avenue to the gate, and descended by the way we came. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #56 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>56. Alterum Memorabile. Quondam in Mundo Spirituali cum Angelis loquens inspiratus sum amaena voluptate videndi Templum Sapientiae, quod semel prius videram, et interrogavi illos de via ad illud; dixerunt, "sequere Lucem, et invenies;" et dixi, "quid hoc, sequere lucem;" dixerunt, "Lux nostra candescit plus et plus, sicut appropinquatur ad illud Templum; quare sequere lucem secundum candoris ejus incrementum, nam Lux nostra procedit a Domino ut Sole, et inde in se spectata est Sapientia:" tunc in comitatu cum binis Angelis vadi secundum incrementum candoris lucis, et ascendi per tramitem clivosum usque ad summitatem unius Collis, qui erat in Plaga meridionali, et ibi erat Porta magnifica; et custos, visis mecum angelis, aperiebat illam; et ecce visus est Porticus ex palmis et lauribus, secundum quem vadimus; circuibat Porticus, et terminabatur in Hortum, in cujus medio erat Templum Sapientiae: cum ibi circumspexi, vidi Aediculas similitudines Templi, in quibus erant Sapientes; accessimus ad unam, et in ostio loquuti sumus cum hospite ibi, et narravimus causam adventus, et modum accessus, et dixit hospes, "beneventote, intrate, sedete, et consociemur sermonibus sapientiae:"</p><p>[2] vidi Aediculam intus, quod esset divisa in duas, et usque erat una; divisa erat in duas per parietem translucidum, at apparuit ut una ex translucentia, quae erat sicut purissimi chrystalli; quaesivi cur ita; dixit, "non sum solus, uxor mecum est, et nos sumus duo, sed usque non duo sed una caro." At dixi, "scio quod sapiens sis, et quid sapiens seu sapientia cum foemina;" ad haec hospes ex quadam indignatione mutabatur facie, et exporrigebat manum, et ecce tunc ex aediculis propinquis alii Sapientes aderant, quibus jocando dixit, "noster advena hic sciscitando inquiit, quid Sapiens seu Sapientia cum Foemina;" ad haec riserunt omnes, et dixerunt, "quid sapiens seu sapientia absque foemina, seu absque amore; uxor est amor sapientiae sapientis."</p><p>[3] Sed hospes dixit, "consociemur nunc aliquo sermone sapientiae; sit sermo de causis, et nunc de causa Pulchritudinis Sexus foeminini:" et tunc in ordine loquuti sunt, et dixit Primus hanc causam, quod Foeminae a Domino creatae sint affectiones sapientiae virorum, et affectio sapientiae est ipsa Pulchritudo. Alter dixit hanc causam, quod Foemina a Domino creata sit per sapientiam viri, quia a viro, et quod inde sit forma sapientiae inspirata affectione amoris, et quia affectio amoris est ipsa vita, est foemina vita sapientiae, masculus autem sapientia, ac vita sapientiae est ipsa Pulchritudo. Tertius dixit hanc causam, quod Foeminis sit data perceptio delitiarum amoris conjugialis, et quia totum illarum corpus est organum illius perceptionis, non potest aliter quam ut habitatio delitiarum amoris conjugialis cum sua perceptione sit Pulchritudo.</p><p>[4] Quartus dixit hanc causam, quod Dominus desumpserit pulchritudinem et elegantiam vitae a Viro, et transcripserit in foeminam, et quod inde vir absque reunitione cum sua pulchritudine et elegantia in foemina, sit torvus, austerus, siccus et inamabilis, et ille non sapiens est nisi sibi soli, et hic est stolidus; at cum vir unitur cum sua pulchritudine et elegantia vitae in uxore, fit jucundus, amaenus, vivus et amabilis, et sic sapiens. Quintus dixit hanc causam, quod Foeminae creatae sint Pulchritudines non propter se sed propter viros, ut viri ex se duri mollescant, animi illorum ex se graves mitescant, et corda illorum ex se frigida calescant; et tales fiunt, cum fiunt una caro cum suis uxoribus.</p><p>[5] Sextus dixit hanc causam, quod Universum a Domino creatum sit perfectissimum opus, at in illo nihil perfectius creatum est, quam Foemina formosa facie et decora moribus, propter causam, ut Vir gratias agat Domino propter illam munificentiam, et retribuat per receptionem sapientiae ab Ipso. Postquam haec et plura similia dicta sunt, apparuit Uxor trans parietem chrystallinum, <sup>1</sup>et dixit ad Maritum, "loquere si placet;" et cum loquutus est, in sermone percipiebatur vita sapientiae ab uxore, sono enim loquelae inerat amor ejus; ita experientia testificata est illam veritatem. Post haec lustravimus Templum sapientiae, et quoque Paradisiaca circum illud, ex quibus impleti gaudiis abivimus, et transivimus Porticum ad portam, et per viam ascensus descendimus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: chrystalinum, </p>
