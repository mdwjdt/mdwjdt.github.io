<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #68 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>68. (vi) All joys and all delights, from first to last, have been conferred on this love.<p>Whatever pleasures a person feels are the products of his love. By their means love shows itself, or rather, comes into existence and life. It is well known that pleasures become more intense as love does, and also the more closely the affections of the moment concern the dominant love. Now since conjugial love is the foundation of all good loves, and since it is imprinted on the smallest details of a person, as shown before, it follows that its pleasures exceed those of all other loves, and the degree to which it is present and joins itself with them makes those loves yield pleasure. For it enlarges the inmost levels of the mind and those of the body at the same time, as the delightful current of its stream flows through and opens them up.</p><p>[2] The reason why all pleasures, from first to last, are conferred on that love is that its purpose so far excels that of the others. Its purpose is the propagation of the human race, and so of the heaven of angels. Since this purpose was the ultimate aim of creation, it follows that every kind of blessedness, bliss, pleasure, charm and gratification that the Lord the Creator could ever confer on a person are concentrated on this love of his. It is obvious that pleasures result from purpose and affect a person in proportion to his love of the purpose, from considering the pleasures of the five senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. Each of these has its own pleasures, which vary depending upon the specific purposes they serve. What then should the pleasure of conjugial love lack, the purpose of which is something which embraces all other purposes? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #68 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>68. 6. Moreover, into this love have been gathered all joys and all delights, from the first to the last of them. All the delights a person feels, of whatever kind, have to do with his love. Love reveals itself through delights; indeed, it exists and lives through them.<p>People know that delights rise and deepen in the degree that love rises and deepens, and also as incidental affections touch more closely the dominant love.<p>Now because conjugial love is the fundamental love of all good loves, and because, as we showed above, it is engraved on even the smallest aspects of a person, it follows that its delights surpass the delights of all other loves, and also that it gives delight to these other loves according as it is present and at the same time united with them. For it swells the inmost feelings of the mind and at the same time the inmost feelings of the body, as the pleasurable stream of its fountain flows through and opens them.</p><p>[2] All delights have been gathered into this love, from the first to the last of them, because of the excellence of the use it serves, surpassing that of all other loves. The use it serves is the propagation of the human race and so of the angelic heaven. And because this use or purpose was the ultimate goal in creation, it follows that all blessings, felicities, delights, gratifications and pleasures, which could ever have been conferred on mankind by the Lord the Creator, have been gathered into this, its accompanying love.<p>It is apparent from the delights of the five senses - sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch - that delights accompany the use they serve and are delightful to a person in accordance with the love he has for it. Each of these senses experiences delights, with variations, according to the particular uses these senses serve. Why not the sensation of conjugial love, whose use or purpose embraces those of all the other senses? </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #68 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>68. 6. And all joys and delights, from first to last, are gathered up in this love. Every pleasant thing that a person senses has to do with his love. Love discloses itself - - - even exists and lives - through those things. We know that pleasures intensify as love intensifies, and as the accompanying feelings touch a governing love more closely.<p>Now, because the love in marriage is the basic one of all good loves, and because it is etched on the most special qualities of a person, as mentioned before, the consequence is that there is more pleasure in it than in any other love. Its pleasures are pleasant according to this love's presence, moreover, and according to its involvement in them at the same time. For it opens out the inner reaches of both mind and body as the delightful stream of its wellspring flows through them and emerges.<p>All joys from highest to lowest are gathered up in this love because it has a more important use than the others - propagation of the human race, and from the race, angels of heaven. This function was the whole purpose of creation, so the result is that all blessings, good times, happiness, friendliness, and enjoyments that the Lord could ever give to people are all gathered up in this love that they have.<p>The pleasures of the five senses - sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch - demonstrate that joys follow function and that a person has pleasures according to his love of an activity. All senses have their pleasures, differing according to their particular functions.<p>All the other functions are wrapped up in the function of married love, so what sense does it not please? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #68 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>68. VI. AND THAT INTO THIS LOVE ARE GATHERED ALL JOYS AND ALL DELIGHTS FROM THEIR FIRST TO THEIR LAST. All delights whatsoever which are felt by man are delights of his love, it being by delights that love manifests itself, yea, that it exists and lives. That delights are exalted in the degree that the love is exalted and also according as incidental affections more nearly touch the ruling love, is known. Now because, as already shown, conjugial love is the fundamental of all good loves and is inscribed upon the very least parts of man, it follows that its delights exceed the delights of all other loves, and also that it makes all other loves delightful according to its presence and at the same time its conjunction with them; for it expands the inmost parts of the mind, and at the same time the inmost parts of the body, as the delicious current of its fountain flows through them and opens them up.</p><p>[2] That all delights from their first to their last are gathered into this love, is because of the excellence of its use above all other uses. Its use is the propagation of the human race, and thence of the angelic heavens; and because this use was the end of ends of creation, it follows that all the states of blessedness, happiness, delight, pleasantness, and pleasure which, by the Lord the Creator, could ever be conferred on man, are gathered into this his love. That delights follow use and are present with man according to the love thereof, is manifest from the delights of the five senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Each of these has its own delights with variations according to their specific uses. What then should not be the delights of the sense of conjugial love, whose use is the complex of all other uses! </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #68 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>68. (vi) Into marital love all joys and delights are gathered from first to last. All the joys we feel imply a love. The love shows itself in them, in fact exists and lives in them. As we know, our joys are exalted in the degree in which love is exalted, also as any incident affections touch the ruling love more nearly. But marital love is fundamental among all good loves, and (as was shown above) is inscribed on the least things in man. Therefore its joys exceed those of all other loves. It also gladdens these other loves to the extent that it is present and united with them. For it expands the inmost things both of the mind and of the body, as its delicious current sweeps through them and opens them. All joys from first to last are gathered into marital love on account of the excellence of its use above that of any other love. Its service is the propagation of the human race and of the angelic heaven therefrom. Because this use is the end of ends in creation, all the beatitude, satisfaction, joy, gladness and pleasure that can ever be conferred on man by the Lord the Creator, are gathered into this human love. The joys of the five senses show how joys attend on use, and are present in a man according to the love of use. Each sense - sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch - has its joys with variation according to the particular use. What joy shall the sense of marital love not have, whose use is the sum of all other uses? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #68 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>68. (6) And that into this love are gathered all joys and all delights from first to last. All delights whatsoever that are felt by man are of his love. By them the love manifests itself, yea, exists, and lives. It is known that delights are exalted in the degree that the love is exalted, and also as the incident affections touch the ruling love more nearly. Now, as conjugial love is the fundamental of all good loves, and as it is inscribed upon the very least things of man, as has been shown before, it follows that its delights exceed the delights of all loves; and also that it imparts delight to them according to its presence and at the same time its conjunction with them. For it expands the inmost things of the mind, and at the same time the inmost things of the body, as the delicious current of its fountain flows through and opens them. It is because of the superior excellence of its use above all other uses that all delights from first to last are gathered into this love. Its use is the propagation of the human race and of the angelic heaven therefrom; and as this use was the end of ends of the creation, it follows that all the states of blessedness, satisfaction, delight, gratification, and pleasure that could ever be conferred on man by the Lord Creator are gathered into this love. That delights follow use, and are present with man according to the love of the use, is manifest from the delights of the five senses,-of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Each of these has its delights, with variations according to their specific uses. What then should not be the delights of the sense of conjugial love whose use is the complex of all other uses? </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #68 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>68. VI: Quodque in illum Amorem collata sint omnia gaudia et omnes delitiae a primis ad ultima. Omnia jucunda, quaecunque sentiuntur ab homine, sunt ejus amoris; amor per illa se manifestat, imo existit et vivit; quod jucunda se exaltent gradu quo se exaltat amor, ut et sicut incidentes affectiones propius tangunt amorem regnantem, notum est: nunc quia Amor conjugialis est fundamentalis omnium bonorum amorum, et quia inscriptus est singularissimis hominis, ut prius ostensum est, consequitur quod illius jucunda excedant jucunda omnium amorum, et quoque jucundet hos secundum praesentiam suam, et simul conjunctionem cum illis; expandit enim intima mentis et simul intima corporis, sicut delitiosa vena fontis ejus transfluit et aperit.</p><p>[2] Quod in hunc Amorem collata sint omnia jucunda a primis ad ultima, est propter Usus ejus excellentiam prae reliquis; Usus est propagatio Generis humani, et inde Coeli Angelici; et quia hic usus fuit finis finium creationis, consequitur quod omnes beatitudines, faustitates, jucunditates, amaenitates et voluptates, quae a Domino Creatore usquam conferri potuerant in hominem, in hunc ejus Amorem collatae sint. Quod jucunda sequantur usum, et secundum hujus amorem insint homini, patet ex jucundis quinque Sensuum, Visus, Auditus, Olfactus, Gustus, et Tactus; unicuique horum sunt jucunda cum variationibus secundum specificos illorum usus; quid non Sensui amoris conjugialis, cujus Usus est complexus omnium reliquorum usuum. </p>
