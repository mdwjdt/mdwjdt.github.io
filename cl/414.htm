<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第414节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>414、关于纯真，我与天使有过各种交谈，他们说，纯真是一切良善的存在或本质，良善仅在它包含纯真的程度内而为良善；此外，由于智慧属于生活，因而属于良善，故智慧在它源于纯真的程度内而为智慧。爱、仁和信也一样。正因如此，若非处于纯真状态，没有人能进天堂。这就是主说这些话的意思：<br><br>让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在天国的，正是这样的人。我实在告诉你们：凡要承受天国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。（马可福音10:14，15;路加福音18:16，17）<br><br>在圣言中，无论此处还是其它地方，小孩子都表示那些处于纯真状态的人。良善之所以在它包含纯真的程度内而为良善，是因为一切良善来自主，纯真则在于被主引领。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>414、我同天使谈过好多，他们说善的实质就是纯真，善因为纯真的存在而成为善。同时，因为智慧与生命有关，并与善有关，智慧因其来自于纯真的特性而成为智慧。爱、仁慈和信念也是如此。他们说，因此人只有拥有纯真才能进入天国。这就是主以下话的含义：</p><p>让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在神国里，正是这样的人。我实在告诉你们：凡要得到神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。（《马可福音》10:14，15  《路加福音》18:16，17）。</p><p>这些以及《圣经》中别的地方，小孩子是指那些处于纯真状态的人。</p><p>善因其中纯真的存在而成为善，因为一切善来自于主，被主带领也就是纯真。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #414 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>414. I have had various conversations with angels about innocence. They said that innocence is the being of all good, and good is only good in so far as it contains innocence; and because wisdom is a matter of how one lives and so of good, it is wisdom in so far as it derives from innocence. The same is true of love, charity and faith. Hence it is that no one can enter heaven, unless he is in a state of innocence. This is the meaning of these sayings of the Lord:<p>Allow the children to come to me, do not prevent them; for of such is the kingdom of the heavens. Truly I tell you, anyone who does not accept the kingdom of the heavens as a child will not enter into it. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_14.htm">Mark 10:14-15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_16.htm">Luke 18:16-17</a>.<p>Children here and in other places in the Word means those who are in a state of innocence. The reason why good is good in so far as it contains innocence is that all good is from the Lord, and innocence is being guided by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #414 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>414. I have had various conversations with angels on the subject of innocence; and they have said that innocence is the essence of all good, and that good is good to the extent that it has innocence in it. Moreover, because wisdom has to do with life, and thus with good, wisdom is wisdom in the measure of the character it derives from innocence. The same is true of love, charity, and faith, they said; and for that reason no one can enter heaven unless he possesses innocence. This, too, is meant by these words of the Lord:<p>Let little children come to Me, do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child will not enter it. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_14.htm">Mark 10:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_16.htm">Luke 18:16-17</a>) <sup >1</sup><p>Here, as also elsewhere in the Word, by little children are meant those who are in innocence.<p>Good is good to the extent that it has innocence in it, because all good is from the Lord, and to be led by the Lord is innocence.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_14.htm">Matthew 19:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_3.htm">18:3</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #414 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>414. I have talked with angels, at various times, about innocence, and they said that innocence is the essence of all good and that good is good so far as innocence is in it. And they said wisdom has to do with life and therefore with good, so wisdom is wisdom so far as it partakes of innocence. The same goes for love, charity, and faith. They said that this is why no one can enter heaven unless he is innocent, and that is what these words of the Lord mean: "Let the children come to Me. Don't keep them away, for the kingdom of the heavens is made up of them. Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of heaven as a child does, won't go into it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_14.htm">Mark 10:14</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_16.htm">Luke 18:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_17.htm">17</a>). There and elsewhere in the Word "children" means those in innocence.<p>The reasons why good is good so far as innocence is in it is that all good is from the Lord, and it is innocence to be led by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #414 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>414. I have had various conversations with angels about innocence. They said that innocence is the esse of every good, and that good is good in the measure that innocence is within it; also, that since wisdom pertains to life and thus to good, it is wisdom so far as it partakes of innocence, the same being true of love, charity, and faith; and furthermore, that it is for this reason that no one can enter heaven unless he has innocence, this being what is meant by the Lord's words:<p>Suffer infants to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of the heavens as an infant shall not enter therein. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_14.htm">Mark 10:14, 15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_16.htm">Luke 18:16, 17</a>.<p>Here, as also in other places in the Word, by infants are meant those who are in innocence. The reason why good is good according to the measure of the innocence within it, is because all good is from the Lord, and innocence consists in being led by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #414 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>414. I have spoken with angels at different times about innocence. They have said that innocence is the esse of every good, and that good is good as far as it has innocence in it; also that as wisdom is of the life and hence of good, wisdom is wisdom as far as it partakes of innocence. The same is true, they said, of love, and charity, and faith. Hence it is, too, that no one can enter heaven unless he has innocence, which is the meaning of the Lord's words:<p>Permit the little children to come to Me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens. Truly I say to you that he who has not received the kingdom of the heavens as a little child shall not enter therein (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_14.htm">Mark 10:14-15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_16.htm">Luke 18:16-17</a>).<p>In this, as in other passages in the Word, infants signify those who are in innocence. Good is good as far as it has innocence in it because all good is from the Lord, and innocence consists in being led by Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #414 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>414. I have had various conversations with the angels about innocence, and they said that innocence is the esse of every good, and that good is good so far as innocence is within it; and as wisdom is of the life and thence of good, that wisdom is wisdom so far as it partakes of innocence. And so with love, charity, and faith. And that thence it is that no one can enter heaven unless he is in innocence; and that this is meant by these words of the Lord:<p>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of the heavens as a little child he shall not enter therein (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_14.htm">Mark 10:14-15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_16.htm">Luke 18:16-17</a>).<p>By little children here, as also in other places in the Word, they are meant who are in innocence. The reason why good is good in so far as innocence is within it, is that all good is from the Lord, and innocence is to be led by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #414 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>414. De Innocentia loquutus sum varia cum Angelis, et dixerunt, quod Innocentia sit Esse omnis boni, et quod bonum tantum sit bonum, quantum in illo est innocentia; et quia Sapientia est vitae, et inde boni, quod sapientia tantum sit sapientia, quantum ducit ex innocentia; similiter amor, charitas, et fides; et quod inde sit, quod nemo possit intrare Coelum, nisi ei innocentia sit; et quod hoc intelligatur per haec Domini verba, "Sinite infantes venire ad Me, ne prohibete eos; talium enim est Regnum coelorum: amen dico vobis, quicunque non receperit Regnum coelorum ut infans, non ingredietur in illud;" <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_10_14-15" target=_top>Marc. 10:14-15</a>. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_18_16-17" target=_top>Luc. 18:16-17</a>: per infantes ibi, ut quoque alibi in Verbo, intelliguntur qui in innocentia sunt. Causa quod bonum sit bonum, quantum in eo est innocentia, est quia omne bonum est a Domino, ac innocentia est duci a Domino. </p>
