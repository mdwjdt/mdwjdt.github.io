<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第468节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>468、⑹找情妇或纳妾的合法理由和离婚的合法理由是一样的，只是妻子仍留在家中。离婚是指解除婚约，从而彻底分离，并且此后完全可以自由地另娶妻。按照主在马太福音（19:9）中的戒律，这种彻底分离或离婚的唯一理由是淫乱。可参考这一理由的，还包括明显的淫秽；这种淫秽逐出谦逊，使家里充满无耻的迎合，变得不宜居住；这会造成一种整个心智会融入其中的放荡无耻。对此，还要加上包含淫乱，促使妻子犯奸淫，从而被休的恶意遗弃（马太福音5:32）。这三个理由是离婚的合法理由，故摆在法官面前的第一个和第三个理由，和摆在这个男人或丈夫自己的判断力面前的第二理由也是找情妇或纳妾的合法理由，只是奸妇，即妻子仍留在家中。淫乱是离婚的唯一理由，因为它与婚姻之爱的生命直接对立，会将它摧毁到灭绝的地步（参看255节）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>468、（7）我们所说的合法的公正原，重要的原因将依次解释。</p><p>这里所说的离婚是指婚约的解除和完全的分离，而有完全的自由去找另一个妻子。在《马太福音》19:9中唯一的离婚的原因就是因为妻子的放荡。</p><p>与这一原因相同的还有明显的放荡行为，致使家中有那各不雅的状态并使头脑产生无耻的色欲。</p><p>还补充一点，恶意地抛弃妻子，而导致妻子被迫做妓女，并导致她被人休。</p><p>以上三种情况是离婚的合法原因——第一种和第三种是在法官的判断下，而第三种是在丈夫的判断下，同时也是与情人交往的合法的原因，尽管有一个放荡的妻子在家中。</p><p>放荡是唯一的离婚的原因，因为它与婚姻之爱相反，会破坏婚姻之爱。（见255节）</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #468 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>468. (vi) The lawful reasons for having a concubine of this kind are those which are lawful grounds for divorce, when the wife is none the less kept at home.<p>Divorce means the abolition of the marriage compact leading to full separation, and followed by the freedom to marry another wife. The sole reason for this total separation or divorce is promiscuity as laid down by the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>). Included under the same heading are cases of obvious obscenity which ruin modesty and fill the house with criminal pandering, making it uncomfortable to live in; this gives rise to the shamelessness of a prostitute, the result of a totally dissolute mind. To this may be added malicious desertion involving promiscuity, which causes a wife to become promiscuous and so to be rejected (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>). These three reasons, being lawful grounds for divorce, the first and third before a judge and the second in the husband's own judgment, are lawful reasons for taking a concubine, but only when the wife is kept on at home. Promiscuity is the sole reason for divorce, because it is the diametrical opposite of the life of conjugial love, being so pernicious as to murder it (<a href="255.htm">255</a> above). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #468 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>468. 6. Legitimate reasons for taking a mistress in such a circumstance are the same as those for legitimate divorce, when the wife is nevertheless retained in the home. By divorce we mean an abolishment of the marriage covenant and thus complete separation, with full liberty after that to take another wife. The only ground for this total separation or divorce is licentiousness, according to the Lord's precept (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>). <sup >1</sup>Relating to the same ground are also manifest obscenities which do away with decency and fill and infest the home with disgraceful panderings, giving rise to a licentious shamelessness into which the whole mind is dissolved.<p>To these is added malicious desertion which involves licentiousness, causing the wife to commit whoredom and so to be rejected (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>). <sup >2</sup><p>These three instances, because they are legitimate grounds for divorce - the first and third before a public judge, and the second before the husband as judge - are also legitimate grounds for taking a mistress, though when the adulterous wife is retained in the home.<p>Licentiousness is the only reason for divorce because it is diametrically opposed to the life of conjugial love and destroys it even to the point of extinction (see above, no. 255).<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"...whoever divorces his wife, excepting for licentiousness, and marries another, commits adultery...."<br><br>2.&nbsp;"...whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of licentiousness, causes her to commit whoredom...." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #468 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>468. 6. The legitimate reasons for divorce, when the wife is nevertheless kept in the house, are legitimate reasons for this type of concubinage.<p>Divorce means abolishing a marriage contract, and full separation on account of it, and afterwards complete freedom to take another wife. The only reason for this total separation or divorce is illicit sex, according to the Lord's instructions (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>). And in the same category are open obscenities. They remove modesty and fill and infest the home with a shameful bawdiness, producing sexual immodesties that your whole mind is dissolved in. Add to these ill-willed desertion that involves illicit sex and makes the wife commit adultery and be rejected for it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>). These three reasons are legitimate reasons for divorce - the first and third in the eyes of a public judge and the second in the man's own judgment - so they are also legitimate reasons to have a concubine, in case the adulterous wife is kept on in the home.<p>The reason why illicit sex is the only cause of divorce is that it is diametrically opposed to the life of married love and destroys it until it is exterminated (see no. 255 above). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #468 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>468. VI. THAT THE LEGITIMATE CAUSES OF THIS CONCUBINAGE ARE LEGITIMATE CAUSES OF DIVORCE, THE WIFE BEING NEVERTHELESS RETAINED IN THE HOME. By divorce is meant the abolition of the conjugial covenant and thus plenary separation and entire liberty thereafter to take another wife. The one only cause of this total separation or divorce is whoredom, according to the Lord's precept in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>. Referable to the same cause are also manifest obscenities which banish modesty and fill and infest the house with shameful panderings, from which arises a scortatory shamelessness into which the whole mind is dissolved. To these causes is added malicious desertion which involves whoredom and causes the wife to commit adultery and thus to be put away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>). These three causes, being legitimate causes of divorce the first and third before a public judge, and the second before the man himself as judge, are also legitimate causes of concubinage, in case the adulterous wife is retained in the home. That whoredom is the one only cause of divorce is because it is diametrically opposite to the life of conjugial love and destroys it even to the point of extermination. See above (no. <a href="255.htm">255</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #468 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>468. (vi) The lawful causes of divorce, when despite divorce the wife is retained in the home, constitute the lawful causes of this concubinage. By divorce is meant the abolition of the marriage covenant and hence complete separation, after which there is all liberty to marry again. The one cause of this total separation or divorce is whoredom, according to the Lord's precept (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>). With this same cause belong manifest obscenities which destroy all shame and fill and infest the home with infamous allurements, out of which a scortatory shamelessness arises into which the whole mind dissolves. Add to these malicious desertion involving whoredom, and leading to the wife's adultery and thus repudiation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>). These three causes, being lawful causes of divorce, the first and third before a public judge, and the second before the man as judge, are also lawful causes of concubinage, in case the adulterous wife is retained in the home. Whoredom is the sole cause of divorce for the reason that it is diametrically opposite to the life of marital love and destroys it even to the point of extermination (see above,<a href="255.htm">255</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #468 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>468. (6) That the legitimate causes of this concubinage are the legitimate causes of divorce, while the wife is nevertheless retained at home. By divorce is meant the abolition of the conjugial covenant and thence complete separation, and entire liberty after that to take another wife. The only cause of this total separation or divorce is scortation, according to the Lord's precept in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>. To the same cause belong also manifest obscenities, which dissolve modesty, and fill and infest the house with infamous intrigues, from which arises a scortatory shamelessness in which the whole mind is dissolved. Add to these, malicious desertion which involves scortation and causes the wife to commit adultery and thus to be put away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>). These three, because they are the legitimate causes of divorce, the first and the third before a public judge, and the second before the man as judge, are also legitimate causes of concubinage, but when the adulterous wife is retained at home. That scortation is the only cause of divorce, because it is diametrically opposite to the life of conjugial love, and destroys it even to the point of extermination, may be seen above, n. <a href="255.htm">255</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #468 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>468. VI. Quod causae legitimae hujus concubinatus, sint causae legitimae divortii, cum uxor nihilominus retinetur domi. Per divortium intelligitur abolitio foederis conjugialis, et inde plenaria separatio, et post hanc integra libertas ducendi aliam uxorem; totalis hujus separationis seu divortii causa unica est scortatio, secundum praeceptum Domini, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_468/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_9" target=_top>Matth. 19:9</a>. Ad eandem etiam se referunt manifestae obscoenitates, quae solvunt pudorem, ac flagitiosis lenociniis implent et infestant domum, ex quibus impudicitia scortatoria, in quam tota mens est dissoluta, exstat. His accedit malitiosa desertio, quae involvit scortationem, ac facit uxorem moechari, et sic repudiari, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_468/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_32" target=_top>Matth. 5:32</a>. Hae tres causae, quia sunt legitimae divortii, prima et tertia coram judice publico, ac media coram judice viro, sunt etiam causae legitimae concubinatus; sed quando uxor moecha retinetur domi. Quod scortatio sit unica causa divortii, est quia e diametro est opposita vitae amoris conjugialis, et hanc usque ad internecionem destruit, videatur supra<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_468/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_255" target=_top>255</a> </p>
