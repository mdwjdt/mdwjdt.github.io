<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第47节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>47、两性情爱仍如在世时它内在的样子，因为人皆有内在和外在。这二者就是所谓的内在人和外在人，故而意愿和思维也有内在和外在之分。人死亡时会留下外在，保留内在。外在属于肉体，内在属于灵。由于人就是自己的爱，爱就居于灵里面，故可知，死后，两性情爱仍如在世时它内在的样子。若这爱的内在是属婚姻和圣洁的，那死后它仍是属婚姻和圣洁的；若是淫乱的，那死后仍是淫乱的。然而，要知道，没有哪两种两性情爱是完全相同的，而是有无数差异。不过，它还是会保持它在每个人灵里的样子。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>47、对异性的爱在内在上与它在世间时一样，是因为每个人之中都有一个内在因素和一个外在因素。这两种因素还被叫作内在人和外在的人。所有人都有内在和外在的意愿和思想。人死后将摆脱外在因素，而内在因素继续存在。因为外在因素是属于躯体的，而内在因素是属于精神的。</p><p>因为一个人的爱是什么样的，这个人就是什么样的，并且爱置身于精神之中，所以这种对异性的爱，在死后继续存在，并且是以其内在的形式而存在。例如，若那种爱在内在上是婚姻之爱或是圣洁的，在死后也将会是这样。但是若在内在上是淫荡的，死后将继续是这样。</p><p>需要指出的是，对异性的爱因人而异。它有无限的种类。但是不论怎样，它将永远存百。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #47 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>47. The reason why sexual love remains as it was inwardly in the world is that everyone has an interior and exterior; this pair is called the inner and the outer man. He has as a result inner and outer will and inner and outer thought. When a person dies, he leaves behind his exterior and keeps his interior, for outward things belong properly to his body, inward things to his spirit. Since a person is his love, and love resides in the spirit, it follows that his sexual love remains with him after death as it was inwardly before. For example, if his love was inwardly conjugial or chaste, it remains conjugial or chaste after death, but if it was inwardly scortatory, <sup >1</sup>it remains the same after death. It should, however, be noted that sexual love is not the same in one person as in another, for there are countless differences. But it still remains in each case as it was in each person's spirit.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This is the opposite of conjugial love, which Swedenborg named amor scortatorius. Though with other nouns 'promiscuous' may serve, it is hardly sufficient to translate 'promiscuous love', since it is especially reserved for the love which is the opposite of the love of one man for one woman, and so is opposed to the principle of monogamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #47 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>47. Love for the opposite sex continues to be what it was like in the world inwardly for the reason that in every person there is an inward aspect and an outward aspect. These two are also called the inner person and the outer person, and so there is an inner and outer will and thought. A person leaves the outward aspect behind when he dies, and he keeps his inner self. For outward qualities are properly those of his body, while the inner qualities are properly those of his spirit.<p>Now because a person is what his love is, and love has its seat in his spirit, it follows that love for the opposite sex remains in a person after death and continues to be what it was like inwardly in him. So, for example, if that love inwardly had been conjugial or chaste, it continues to be conjugial and chaste after death. But if it had been inwardly licentious, it continues to be also like that after death.<p>It must be known, however, that love for the opposite sex is not the same in one person as in another. Its variations are limitless. But still, whatever it is like in each person's spirit, so it also remains. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #47 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>47. Sexual love stays as it was inwardly while the person was in the world, because everyone has an inward and an outward side.<p>These two are also called the inner and outer person. So there is an inner and an outer will and thought. A person leaves the outer part behind and keeps the inner part when he dies, because the outer things belong to his body and the inner ones belong to his spirit.<p>Now, a person is his love, and love resides in his spirit, so this means that sexual love stays with him after death the way it was, inwardly, in him. For example, if his inner love has been for marriage, or chaste, it continues to be a love for marriage and chaste after death. And if it has been inwardly a love for promiscuity, it remains that way after death, too. But note that sexual love is not the same with one person as it is with another. There are infinite varieties of it. But it absolutely stays the same as it was in each person's spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #47 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>47. The reason why love of the sex remains after death such as it had been interiorly in the world is this: With every man there is an internal and an external, these two being also called the internal and external man. Hence there is an internal and external will and thought. When a man dies, he leaves his external and retains his internal; for externals pertain properly to his body, and internals properly to his spirit. Now because a man is his own love, and his love resides in his spirit, it follows that his love of the sex remains after death such as it had been within him interiorly. For example, if interiorly that love had been conjugial or chaste, it remains conjugial and chaste after death; and if interiorly it had been scortatory, it also remains such after death. But it must be known that love of the sex is not the same with one man as with another. Its differences are infinite in number; yet, such as it is in the spirit of each man, such also it remains. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #47 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>47. Love for the sex continues such as it was inwardly in the world, because in every person there are an internal and an external, which are also called internal and external man, and thence there are internal and external will and thought. When a man dies, he leaves the external and retains his internal. For, strictly, the externals are of the body, and the internals are of the spirit. Because man is his own love, and love resides in his spirit, it follows that sexual love remains with him after death such as it had been inwardly with him. If, for instance, it had been marital and chaste, after death it remains marital and chaste; but if inwardly it had been scortatory, such also it remains after death. It is also to be understood that sexual love is not the same with all; there are endless differences; still, such as, it was in one's spirit, such it remains. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #47 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>47a. The reason why the love of the sex remains of such quality after death as it was interiorly in the world is this: With every man there is an internal and an external, which two are also called the internal and the external man; and hence there is an internal and external will and thought. When a man dies he leaves the external and retains his internal; for the externals pertain properly to his body, and the internals properly to his spirit. Now, as a man is his own love, and the love resides in his spirit, it follows that his love of the sex remains such after death as it was within him interiorly. For example, if that love was inwardly conjugial love, or chaste, it remains conjugial and chaste after death; but if it was inwardly scortatory, it likewise remains so after death. But it is to be known that the love of the sex is not the same with one as with another. Its differences are infinite. But yet such as it is in the spirit of anyone, such also it remains. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #47 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>47. Quod Amor sexus maneat qualis ille fuit interius in Mundo, est quia apud omnem hominem est Internum et Externum, quae duo etiam vocantur Internus et Externus homo, ac inde est Interna et Externa Voluntas et Cogitatio; homo relinquit Externum, ac retinet Internum suum, cum moritur; Externa enim proprie sunt ejus corporis, ac Interna sunt proprie ejus spiritus; nunc quia homo est suus Amor, et Amor insidet spiritui ejus, sequitur quod Amor sexus apud illum post mortem maneat, qualis ille fuit interius apud illum; ut pro exemplo, si Amor ille interius fuerat conjugialis seu castus, manet ille post mortem conjugialis et castus; at si interius fuerat scortatorius, manet post mortem etiam talis. At sciendum est, quod Amor sexus non similis sit apud unum qualis apud alterum; sunt differentiae ejus infinitae; sed usque, qualis est in spiritu cujusvis, talis etiam manet. </p>
