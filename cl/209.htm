<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第209节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第十章  婚姻问题概述</h4><p>209、涉及婚姻的内容有很多，倘若详加论述，这本小书将变成鸿篇巨制。例如，我能谈论夫妻间的相似之处和不同之处；属世的婚姻之爱如何被提升变成属灵的婚姻之爱，它们又如何联结；一方如何随着另一方的增长而下降；这两种爱的种类和不同之处；妻子的聪明；天堂所发出的婚姻总气场和地狱所发出的对立气场；它们如何流入并被接受；除此之外还有许多其它话题，若详细展开，这些内容就会使本书变成鸿篇巨制，致使读者疲倦不堪。因此，为避免冗长无用的啰嗦，我将这些问题浓缩成一章，标题为“婚姻问题概述”。和前几章一样，我将它们分成以下系列要点：<br><br>⑴婚姻之爱的特有感觉是触觉。<br><br>⑵对那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人来说，变得智慧的能力逐渐增长；而对那些对缺乏真正婚姻之爱的人来说，则逐渐下降。<br><br>⑶对那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人来说，同居的幸福逐渐增长；而对那些缺乏真正婚姻之爱的人来说，则逐渐下降。<br><br>⑷对那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人来说，心智的联结和随之的友谊逐渐增长；而对那些缺乏真正婚姻之爱的人来说，这二者都逐渐下降。<br><br>⑸那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人不断想成为一个人；而那些缺乏真正婚姻之爱的人则想成为两个人。<br><br>⑹那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人期待永恒的婚姻，而那些缺乏真正婚姻之爱的人正好相反。<br><br>⑺婚姻之爱居于贞洁的妻子里面，然而她们的爱仍取决于她们的丈夫。<br><br>⑻只要丈夫热爱婚姻的纽带，妻子也会热爱它们。<br><br>⑼女人的聪明本质上是谦逊、优雅、平和、顺从、轻柔、温和；而男人的聪明本质上是严肃、粗鲁、硬朗、勇猛、放纵。<br><br>⑽妻子体验不到男人所感受的那种性兴奋，但她们有准备接受的状态。<br><br>⑾男人所拥有的性充裕取决于他们对生殖其智慧之真理的爱，还取决于他们对履行有用服务的爱。<br><br>⑿做爱的决定在于丈夫的美意。<br><br>⒀婚姻的气场从主经由天堂流入宇宙的每一个细节，甚至延伸至其最低级的形式。<br><br>⒁该气场由女性接受，并通过女性传给男性，而不是反过来。<br><br>⒂哪里有真正的婚姻之爱，该气场就在哪里被妻子接受，并唯独通过妻子被丈夫接受。<br><br>⒃哪里没有真正的婚姻之爱，该气场在哪里纵然被妻子接受，但无法通过她被丈夫接受。<br><br>⒄真正的婚姻之爱有可能存在于夫妻一方里面，同时却未存在于另一方里面。<br><br>⒅夫妻既有各种相似之处，又有各种不同之处，无论内在的还是外在的。<br><br>⒆各种相似之处能被联结起来，但无法与不同之处联结。<br><br>⒇主为那些渴望真正婚姻之爱的人提供相似的配偶，若在世上找不到，就在天上提供一个。<br><br>(21)人的婚姻之爱越衰退和丧失，他就越接近动物的本性。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">与婚姻相关的问题</h4><p>209、与婚姻相关的内容有很多，不能一一列举。比如夫妇间相似性和相异性，由自然的婚姻之爱向精神的婚姻之爱的转化和二者的结合。其中一者的增长和另一者的减退。其种类、妻子的才智，来自于天堂的婚姻的氛围和与其相反的来自地狱的氛围，它们的流入及被接收，以及其它一些话题。</p><p>在此仅做以下若干点讲述：</p><p>（1）婚姻之爱的特殊感觉就是触觉。</p><p>（2）拥有真正的婚姻之爱的人变得更有智慧的能力会增长，没有真正婚姻之爱的人变得更有智慧的能力会降低。</p><p>（3）拥有真正婚姻之爱的人的幸福是递增的，不拥有真正婚姻之爱的人的幸福是递减的。</p><p>（4）拥有真正婚姻之爱的人的头脑的相互结合是递增的，他们的友谊也随之递增。不拥有婚姻之爱的人的头脑的相互结合是递减的，其友谊也是这样。</p><p>（5）处于真正婚姻之爱的人不断希望成为一个人，而不拥有真正婚姻之爱的人的情况则相反。</p><p>（6）处于真正婚姻之爱中的人追求婚姻的永恒，没有真正婚姻之爱的人的情况则相反。</p><p>（7）婚姻之爱处于贞洁的妻子中，但它取决于她的丈夫。</p><p>（8）若丈夫们喜爱婚姻的联合关系，妻子们也喜爱婚姻的联合关系。</p><p>（9）女人的才智的本性是谦逊，高雅、平和、温柔的，而男人才智的本性是批判性的，粗旷的，有抗拒性的，爱争辩的，缺乏忍耐性的。</p><p>（10）妻子们不会象丈夫们一样会经历受激发的阶段，妻子们是处于一种接受的状态。</p><p>（11）男人的性能力与其对真理的传播及对有益的工作的爱有关。</p><p>（12）丈夫拥有性活动的主动权。</p><p>（13）由主而来的婚姻氛围流入到世界万物中。</p><p>（14）这种氛围被女性所接收并传递到男性中，相反则不然。</p><p>（15）真正的婚姻之爱是被妻子所接收而传给丈夫的。</p><p>（16）没有婚姻之爱的情况下，这种爱被妻子接受，但却没有传给丈夫。</p><p>（17）真正的婚姻之爱可能存在于夫妻中的一方中，却不一定也同时存在于另一方中。</p><p>（18）不同的夫妇有内在和外在的区别。</p><p>（19）多种相似的品质可以相互结合，不同的品质则不然。</p><p>（20）主为渴望婚姻之爱的人提供一个有相同愿望的人。若在世间找不到则会是存在于天国中。</p><p>（21）当人对婚姻之爱的渴望减退并消失时，他的性格就越接近动物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #209 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>209. CHAPTER X. GENERALITIES ON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE<p>If I were to record in detail all the many facts about marriage, this small work would grow into a large volume. For instance, I could talk about likeness and unlikeness in married partners; the way natural conjugial love is raised to become spiritual conjugial love, and how they are linked; how one declines as the other increases; the various types of both these forms of love, and how they differ; the intelligence of wives; the general sphere of marriage which radiates from heaven, and the opposing sphere from hell; how they exert their influence and are received; and many other subjects, which, if expounded in detail, would make this work into such a vast volume it would weary the reader. For this reason, and to avoid useless prolixity, I shall abbreviate these subjects into a chapter of generalities on the subject of marriage. These, as in previous chapters, will be divided into a series of propositions, as follows.<p>(i) The sense which properly belongs to conjugial love is that of touch.<p>(ii) In the case of those who enjoy truly conjugial love the ability to be wise increases, but in the case of those who do not, it decreases.<p>(iii) In the case of those who enjoy truly conjugial love the joy of living together increases, but in the case of those who do not, it decreases.<p>(iv) In the case of those who enjoy truly conjugial love the linking of minds increases, and so does friendship along with it, but in the case of those who do not, both of these decrease.<p>(v) Those who enjoy truly conjugial love continually want to be a single person, but those who do not, want to be two people.<p>(vi) Those who enjoy truly conjugial love have eternity in view in their marriage; but the reverse is true of those who do not.<p>(vii) Conjugial love is lodged with chaste wives, but their love still depends upon their husbands.<p>(viii) <sup >1</sup>Wives love the bonds of marriage provided their husbands do.<p>(ix) The intelligence of women is in essence modest, refined, peaceful, yielding, gentle and tender; but that of men is in essence serious, harsh, hard, spirited and disposed to licence.<p>(x) Wives do not share the arousal which men feel, but they have a state of readiness to receive.<p>(xi) Men's potency is proportional to their love of propagating the truths of their wisdom, and to their love of performing services.<p>(xii) Decisions [about making love] <sup >2</sup>must be left for the husband to make as he pleases.<p>(xiii) There is a sphere of marriage which flows from the Lord through heaven into every detail of the universe, down to the most trivial.<p>(xiv) This sphere is received by the female sex, and by them it is transferred to the male sex; but the reverse of this is not the case.<p>(xv) Where truly conjugial love exists, this sphere is received by the wife and is only received by the husband through the wife.<p>(xvi) Where conjugial love does not exist, this sphere is certainly received by the wife, but not by the husband through her.<p>(xvii) Truly conjugial love can exist with one of a married couple and not at the same time with the other.<p>(xviii) There are a number of [likenesses and] <sup >3</sup>unlikenesses, both inward and outward, to be found among married couples.<p>(xix) A number of likenesses can be linked, but not with unlikenesses.<p>(xx) The Lord provides a likeness for those who desire truly conjugial love, and if this is impossible on earth, He provides for it in the heavens.<p>(xxi) In so far as a person suffers failure or loss of conjugial love, he approximates to the nature of an animal.<p>Now follows the explanation of these propositions.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="217.htm">217-218</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="221.htm">221</a> shows that this is what is meant.<p>3.&nbsp;These words are restored from <a href="227.htm">227</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #209 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>209. UNIVERSAL MATTERS RELATING TO MARRIAGES<p>There are very many points in regard to marriage which, if presented in detail, would swell this book into an immense volume. For we could present a detailed treatment of various particulars relating to similarities and dissimilarities between partners; to the elevation of natural conjugial love into spiritual conjugial love, and the conjunction of the two; to the gradual growth of the one and the gradual decline of the other; to the varieties and diversities in each; to the intelligence in wives; to the universal conjugial atmosphere emanating from heaven, and the one opposite to it from hell; to the way these flow in and are received; and many other topics besides, which, if they were set out point by point, would expand this work into so large a tome it would weary the reader.<p>For this reason, and to avoid useless prolixities, we consolidate these items into this chapter on "Universal Matters Relating to Marriages." As in previous chapters, however, we will divide them into discussions under their own headings, as follows:<p>1. The special sense of conjugial love is the sense of touch.<p>2. In the case of people who are in a state of truly conjugial love, their capacity for growing wise increases, but with those who are not in a state of conjugial love, it decreases.<p>3. In the case of people who are in a state of truly conjugial love, their happiness in living together increases, but with those who are not in a state of conjugial love, it decreases.<p>4. In the case of people who are in a state of truly conjugial love, their union of minds increases, and with it, their friendship, but with those who are not in a state of conjugial love, these both decrease.<p>5. People who are in a state of truly conjugial love continually wish to be one person, but those who are not in a state of conjugial love want to be two separate individuals.<p>6. People who are in a state of truly conjugial love look to eternity in their marriage, while the opposite is the case with those who are not in a state of conjugial love.<p>7. Conjugial love has its seat in chaste wives, but still their love depends on their husbands.<p>8. Wives love the bonds of marriage, provided that their husbands love them too.<p>9. The intelligence of women is by nature modest, gracious, peaceable, compliant, soft and gentle, whereas the intelligence of men is by nature critical, rough, resistant, argumentative, and given to intemperance.<p>10. Wives do not experience a state of arousal as their husbands do, but theirs is a state of readiness to receive.<p>11. The sexual abundance men have is according to their love of propagating the truths of their wisdom and according to their love of performing useful services.<p>12. Determinations to intercourse are at the good pleasure of the husband.<p>13. There is a conjugial atmosphere which flows in from the Lord through heaven into each and every thing of the universe, extending even to its lowest forms.<p>14. This atmosphere is received by the female sex and communicated through it to the male sex, and not the other way around.<p>15. Where a truly conjugial love exists, this atmosphere is received by the wife, and by the husband solely through his wife.<p>16. Where the love is not conjugial, this atmosphere is indeed received by the wife, but not by the husband through her.<p>17. Truly conjugial love can be present in one of the partners and not at the same time in the other.<p>18. Married partners bring with them [various similarities and] <sup >1</sup>various dissimilarities, both internal and external.<p>19. Various similar qualities can be joined together, but not with dissimilar ones.<p>20. For people who desire truly conjugial love, the Lord provides a similar partner, and if one is not found on earth, He provides one in heaven.<p>21. To the degree that a person's conjugial love wanes and is lost, his character approaches that of an animal.<p>Explanation of these statements now follows.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See no. <a href="227.htm">227</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #209 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>209. Chapter 10. General Observations About Marriages<p>There are so many things to say about marriages that they would swell this little book into a huge volume if they were told in detail. One could go into detail, you see, about similarity and difference among married partners, about the worldly love in marriage rising into a spiritual love in marriage and about how the two are united, about how the one waxes and the other wanes, about each one's varieties and differences, about the intelligence of wives, about a general atmosphere of marriage coming from heaven and its opposite from hell and how these inflow and are accepted, and many other things. If these things were presented one by one it would expand this book into a big enough document to wear a reader out. For this reason, and to avoid being pointlessly wordy, these things are all brought together into general observations about marriages.<p>Like the earlier chapters, though, these are broken down into the following articles.<p>1. Married love's particular sense is the sense of touch.<p>2. The ability to be wise grows in people who have real married love, but for those who do not have married love it shrinks.<p>3. For people who have real married love the happiness of living together grows, but for those who do not, it shrinks.<p>4. For people who have real married love the unity of their minds grows, and with it friendship, but in those who do not, these shrink.<p>5. People who have real married love constantly want to be one person, but those who do not have married love want to be two.<p>6. People who have married love focus on the permanence of marriage, but the reverse holds true for those who do not.<p>7. Married love resides in chaste wives, but their love still depends on their husbands.<p>8. Wives love the bonds of matrimony, provided that the men love them.<p>9. In its own right, women's intelligence is modest, tasteful, peaceable, yielding, pliant, and tender, but men's intelligence in its own right is heavy, rough, hard, bold, and liberty loving.<p>10. Wives do not experience arousal the way men do, but they have a state of being ready to accept.<p>11. Men have sexual potency in proportion to their love of putting forth truths of their wisdom and doing useful things in keeping with their love.<p>12. Making love is at the husband's discretion.<p>13. There is an aura of marriage that radiates from the Lord, through heaven, into each and every thing in the universe, all the way to the lowest of them.<p>14. The female sex receives this aura and passes it on to the male sex, and not the other way around.<p>15. Where there is real love in marriage the wife accepts this aura, and the husband accepts it only through his wife.<p>16. Where there is love that is not the love of marriage, the wife does accept the aura of marriage, but the husband does not accept it through her.<p>17. Real married love can be present in one spouse when it is not present in the other.<p>18. There are various similarities and various differences between married partners, inner as well as outer.<p>19. The various similarities can unite with each other but not with the differences.<p>(20). For people who yearn for real married love the Lord provides someone similar, and if someone similar is not available on earth, He provides someone in heaven.<p>(21). The more a person lacks or rejects married love, the more that person is like an animal.<p>Now to explain these ideas. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #209 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>209. UNIVERSALS CONCERNING MARRIAGES<p>There are many things about marriages which, if treated of in detail, would swell this small work into a large volume; for it might treat in detail of similitude and dissimilitude in married partners; of the elevation of natural conjugial love into spiritual conjugial love and of their conjunction; of the increments of the one and the decrements of the other; of the varieties and diversities of each; of the intelligence of wives; of the universal conjugial sphere from heaven and of its opposite from hell; of their influx and reception, <sup >1</sup>besides much else which, if set forth in detail, would swell this work into a book so bulky as to tire the reader. For this reason and to avoid empty prolixity, these subjects are condensed into Universals concerning Marriages, and these, like the preceding subjects, shall be distributed into articles, as follows:<p>I. That the sense proper to conjugial love is the sense of touch.<p>II. That with those who are in love truly conjugial, the faculty of becoming wise increases, but with those who are not in conjugial love it decreases.<p>III. That with those who are in love truly conjugial, the happiness of cohabitation increases, but with those who are not in conjugial love it decreases.<p>IV. That with those who are in love truly conjugial, conjunction of minds and therewith friendship increases, but with those who are not in conjugial love, the latter together with the former decreases.<p>V. That those who are in love truly conjugial continually will to be one man, but those who are not in conjugial love will to be two.<p>VI. That those who are in love truly conjugial look to what is eternal in marriage; not so those who are not in conjugial love.<p>VII. That conjugial love resides with chaste wives, yet their love depends on their husbands.<p>VIII. That wives love the bonds of marriage if only the men love those bonds.<p>IX. That in itself the intelligence of women is modest, elegant, pacific, yielding, gentle, tender; and the intelligence of men in itself is grave, harsh, hard, spirited, fond of license.<p>X. That wives are in no excitation as men are, but that with them there is a state of preparation for reception.<p>XI. That men have abundance according to their love of propagating the truths of their wisdom, and according to their love of performing uses.<p>XII. That determinations are at the good pleasure of the husband.<p>XIII. That there is a conjugial sphere which inflows from the Lord through heaven into every single thing of the universe even to its ultimates.<p>XIV. That this sphere is received by the female sex, and through this sex is transferred into the male sex, and not the reverse.<p>XV. That where there is love truly conjugial, this sphere is received by the wife and by the husband solely through the wife.<p>XVI. That where there is no conjugial love, this sphere is indeed received by the wife but not by the husband through her.<p>XVII. That love truly conjugial may exist with one of the partners and not at the same time with the other.<p>XVIII. That with married partners there are various similitudes and various dissimilitudes, both internal and external.<p>XIX. That various similitudes can be conjoined, but not with dissimilitudes.<p>XX. That for those who desire love truly conjugial, the Lord provides similitudes; and if not given on earth, He provides them in the heavens.<p>XXI. That according to the defect and loss of conjugial love, man approaches to the nature of a beast.<p>Now follows the explanation of these articles.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Author's ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING MARRIAGE, of which only the Index is extant, each of these subjects formed a separate chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #209 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>209. IX. UNIVERSALS ABOUT MARRIAGES<p>There are so many things to say about marriage that, were they told in detail, they would swell this small work into a large volume. For we might discuss in detail: likeness and unlikeness in partners; the elevation of natural marital love into spiritual, and their conjunction; the increase of the one and the decrease of the other; the varieties and the diversities of each of these loves; the intelligence of wives; the universal marital sphere from heaven, and its opposite from hell; the influx and reception of these spheres; besides much else. Were each topic given a chapter, this work would grow into a volume so large it would tire the reader. For this reason, and to avoid pointless prolixity, these topics are gathered into one chapter on "Universals about Marriages." But, like former topics, they are considered in separate propositions, as follows:<p>I. The sense of touch is the especial sense of marital love.<p>II. The faculty of growing wise increases with those in true marital love, but decreases with those not in marital love.<p>III. The joy of living together increases with those in true marital love, but decreases with those not in marital love.<p>IV. With those in true marital love conjunction of minds increases, and friendship with it, but both decrease with those not in marital love.<p>V. Those in true marital love continually wish to be one human being, while those not in marital love wish to be two.<p>VI. Those in true marital love look to eternity in marriage; contrariwise those not in marital love.<p>VII. Marital love resides with chaste wives, but still their love depends on the husbands.<p>VIII. Wives love the bonds of marriage provided the husbands do.<p>Ix. The intelligence of women in itself is modest, refined, pacific, yielding, gentle, and tender; but men's intelligence in itself is serious, rough, hard, spirited, and license-loving.<p>X. Wives have no excitation such as men have, but a state of preparation for reception.<p>XI. Men have ability according to the love of propagating the truths of their wisdom and according to the love of doing uses.<p>XII. Determinations are at the husband's good pleasure.<p>XIII. There is a marital sphere which flows from the Lord through heaven into each and all things of the universe to the outmost things.<p>XIV. This sphere is received by the feminine sex, and transmitted by it to the masculine; and not the other way about.<p>XV. Where true marital love exists, this sphere is received by the wife, and by the husband through the wife alone.<p>XVI. Where the love is not marital, this sphere is received by the wife, of course, but not by the husband through her.<p>XVII. True marital love may exist with one partner and not with the other.<p>XVIII. There are various internal and external likenesses and unlikenesses in partners.<p>XIX. Various likenesses can be conjoined, but unlikenesses cannot.<p>XX. For those who desire true marital love the Lord provides a likeness, and if it is not given on earth, He provides one in the heavens.<p>XXI. In the measure of the absence or loss of marital love, man approximates the nature of a beast.<p>Explanation of these propositions follows. </p>

Quod Viris sit copia secundum amorem propagandi vera sapientiae suae, et secundum amorem faciendi usus. <p>XII. Quod determinationes sint in beneplacitis mariti. <p>XIII. Quod Sphaera conjugialis sit, quae a Domino per coelum influit in omnia et singula Universi usque ad ultima ejus. <p>XIV. Quod haec Sphaera recipiatur a Sexu foeminino, et per hunc transferatur in Sexum masculinum; et non vicissim. <p>XV. Quod, ubi Amor vere conjugialis est, haec Sphaera recipiatur ab Uxore, et unice per uxorem a Marito. <p>XVI.
