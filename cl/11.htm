<h4 align="center"></h4><p>11、这一系列事件结束后，有声音从天上传来，对拿号筒的天使说：“从所有这些人中挑出十个人，带到我们这里来。我们从主那里听到，祂要预备他们，以便三天之内我们天堂的热和光，即爱和智慧不会伤害他们。”于是，十个人被挑选出来，跟在天使后面。他们沿着陡峭的山路爬上一个山冈，又从这里攀上一座大山，那些天使的天堂就在这大山之巅。此前，这大山在他们看来，遥远得如同云中的穹苍。大门为他们敞开，当他们经过第三道岗哨时，引领他们的天使急忙赶到社群或天堂的君主面前，宣告他们的到来。君主回应说：“带上我的几个随从，告诉他们，我欢迎他们的到来，把他们领到我的前院，给他们每人配一个房间和卧室。再从我的侍臣和仆人中抽出几个人伺候他们，满足他们的愿望。”这一切照所吩咐的都安排妥当了。当他们被天使带进来后，就询问可不可以拜见君主。天使回答说：“现在是早上，中午之前见不到他。在此之前，所有人都在忙于自己的职责和工作。但你们被邀共进午餐，那时你们会和我们的君主一同坐席。在此期间，我会将你们带到他的宫殿，见识里面的壮丽辉煌。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>11、这以后，来自天堂之外的一个声音对拿着喇叭的天使说：‘从集合的人中选出十人，带他们到我这儿来。我从主那儿得知，主将使这些人准备好，这样我们天堂的热和光，爱和智慧在三天之中不会对他们造成任何伤害。”</p><p>于是天使选了十个人，他们跟随着他。他们通过一个陡峭的道路来到一个山顶，从那里又来到一座大山的顶部。在那里是天使们的天堂，这个天堂从前在他们看来就像一片硕大的云。门也像他们敞开着。当他们通过了第三道门后，带路的天使急忙地向这个天堂中的王子禀报他们的到来。</p><p>王 子回答道：“带上我的随从，欢迎他们的到来，带他们到我外部大厅中来，分给他们各自住处。带上我的侍从，为他们服务。</p><p>这些都按命令做好了。</p><p>然而，在天使将他们带到大厅时，他们询问能否见王子。天使回答说：“现在是上午，中午以前，拜访是不被许可的。你们被邀请去吃午饭，与王了一同进餐。同时，我将带你们到王宫去，你们将见到许多壮美的事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #11 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>11. When these events had taken place, a voice was heard from heaven, saying to the angel with the trumpet: 'Choose ten out of all the assembly and bring them in to us. We have been told by the Lord that He will prepare them, so that for three days the heat and light, that is, the love and wisdom, of our heaven will not do them any harm.'<p>So ten were chosen and followed the angel. They went up a hill by a sloping path, and from there on to a mountain, on top of which was the heaven of those angels. Previously seen from a distance it had looked to them like an expanse in the clouds. Gates were opened for them, and when they had passed through the third, the angel conducting them hastened to the prince of that community or heaven, and announced their arrival.<p>'Take some of my retinue,' replied the prince, 'and tell our guests that their arrival is welcome to me. Take them into my outer courtyard, and allot each a room with its bedroom. And take some from my court and servants to wait upon them and serve them at their wish.' This was done as had been ordered.<p>When they had been brought in by the angel, they asked whether they might visit the prince and see him. 'It is morning now,' replied the angel, 'and you cannot see him before noon. Until then all are occupied with their duties and work. But you have been invited to lunch, and you will then sit at table with our prince. Meanwhile I shall take you into his palace, to see the splendid and magnificent things in it.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #11 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>11. Following these events, a voice was heard out of heaven saying to the angel with the trumpet, "Choose ten of all the people assembled and bring them to us. We have heard from the Lord that He will prepare them so that the heat and light, or love and wisdom, of our heaven will not do them any harm for three days."<p>So the angel chose ten, and they followed him. And they ascended by a steep path to a certain hilltop, and from there to a mountaintop, on which those angels had their heaven, which before had appeared to them in the distance like an expanse in the clouds. The gates were also opened for them, and after they passed the third of these, the angel guide hurried to the prince of that society or heaven and reported their arrival.<p>And the prince replied, "Take some of my attendants and report to the visitors that I welcome their arrival, and bring them to my outer hall and assign each of them his apartment with his bedroom. Take some of my courtiers and servants, too, to wait on them and serve them at their bidding."<p>And so it was done.<p>However, when the angel brought them to the outer hall, they asked whether they might go and see the prince, and the angel answered, "It is now morning and visits are not allowed before noon. Till then they are all engaged in their official duties and employments. But you are invited to the midday luncheon, and then you will sit down to dine with our prince. Meanwhile, I will take you into the palace, where you will see magnificent and splendid things." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #11 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>11. When that was over a voice sounded from the sky to the angel with the trumpet, "Choose ten from the whole group and lead them to us. We have heard from the Lord that He will prepare them so that for three days the heat and light - or the love and wisdom - of our heaven will not harm them."<p>Ten were chosen and followed the angel, and they went up a certain hill by a steep path, and from there up a mountain where the heaven of those angels was. They had seen it before from a distance as if laid out in the clouds. The gates were opened before them, and when they passed the third gate the angel guide ran to the prince of that community of heaven and announced they were there.<p>And the prince answered, "Take some of my attendants, and report to the visitors that I acknowledge their arrival. Bring them into my outer court, and assign each one an apartment with a bedroom. And take some of my courtiers and servants to look after them and be on call."<p>This was done. But when the angel brought them in, they asked permission to go and see the prince. The angel answered, "Not before noon. It's morning now. They're all busy with their duties and work. But you're invited to lunch, and then you will sit at the table with our prince. Meantime, I'll take you into the palace, where you'll see magnificent and splendid things." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #11 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>11. When these recitals were concluded, a voice was heard from heaven saying to the angel of the trumpet: "Choose ten out of all those who were called together, and introduce them to us. We have heard from the Lord that He will prepare them so that for three days the heat and light, or love and wisdom, of our heaven will do them no harm."<p>Ten were then chosen and these followed the angel. By a steep path they ascended a certain hill, and from this, the mountain upon which was the heaven of those angels. At a distance, this heaven had previously been seen by them as an expanse among the clouds. The gates were opened for them; and when they had passed the third gate, the angel guide hastened to the prince of that society or heaven and announced their coming. The prince then responded: "Take some of my attendants, and inform them that their coming is acceptable to me. Then, after bringing them into my outer court and assigning to each his room with its bed chamber, take some of my courtiers to minister to them and some of my servants to serve them at their pleasure." And this was done.<p>When they were brought in by the angel, they asked whether they would be allowed to go and see the prince; and the angel answered: "It is not allowed before noon, and it is now morning. Until noon, all are engaged in their offices and employments. But you are invited to dinner, and you will then sit at table with our prince. Meanwhile, I will conduct you into his place where you will see things magnificent and splendid." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #11 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>11. After these things a voice was heard from heaven addressing the angel trumpeter, "Pick ten of all who were called together, and bring them to us. We have heard from the Lord that He will prepare them so that for three days the heat and light, or love and wisdom, of our heaven will not hurt them."<p>Ten were selected, and followed the angel. They took a steep path up a hill, and then went on up a mountain, on which was that heaven of angels which from a distance had looked to them earlier like an expanse in the clouds. Gates were opened to them, and after they had passed through the third one, the angel guide hastened on to the prince of that society or heaven and announced their arrival. The prince replied, "Take some of my retinue and tell your company that they are welcome. Bring them into my forecourt and assign each an apartment with a sleeping-room. Take some of my courtiers and their servitors, and have them wait on their pleasure." It was so done.<p>When they had been ushered in by the angel, they asked whether they might go and see the prince. The angel replied, "It is morning still. He cannot be seen before noon; until then all are engaged at their posts and in their employments. But you have been invited to dinner and will sit at table with the prince. Meanwhile I will take you to his palace, where you will see magnificent and splendid things." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #11 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>11. These things having been transacted a voice was heard from heaven, saying to the angel with the trumpet, 'Choose ten out of the whole assembly and introduce them to us. We have heard from the Lord that He will prepare them so that for three days the heat and light, or the love and wisdom of our heaven will do them no harm.'<p>And ten were chosen and followed the angel.

<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #11 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>11. His peractis audita est vox e Coelo ad Angelum tubae, "elige decem ex omnibus convocatis, et introduc illos ad nos; audivimus a Domino, quod praeparaturus sit illos, ne calor et lux, seu amor et sapientia, nostri Coeli, per tres dies inferant illis aliquam noxam;" et electi sunt decem, et sequuti Angelum; et ascenderunt per tramitem clivosum in quendam collem, et ab hoc in Montem, super quo erat illorum Angelorum Coelum, quod prius ad distantiam apparuerat illis sicut Expansum in nubibus: et aperiebantur pro illis portae, et postquam transiverunt tertiam, Angelus introductor cucurrit ad Principem Societatis seu Coeli illius, et annuntiavit adventum illorum; et Princeps respondit, "assume aliquos ex satellitio meo, et renuntia illis, quod adventus illorum mihi sit acceptus, et introduc illos in Anticuriam meam, et distribue cuivis suum conclave cum suo cubiculo; et ex aulicis meis desume aliquos, et ex famulis qui ministrent illis, et qui serviant illis ad nutus;" et factum est ita. At cum introducti sunt ab Angelo, quaesiverunt num liceat adire et videre Principem; et respondit Angelus, "est nunc mane, et non licet ante tempus meridiei; sunt omnes eousque in suis officiis et in <sup>1</sup>suis operis; sed invitati estis ad prandium; et tunc ad mensam cum Principe nostro sedebitis: interea introducam vos in illius Palatium, ubi videbitis magnifica et splendida."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: in suis in officiis & </p>
