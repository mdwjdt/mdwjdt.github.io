<h4 align="center"></h4><p>283、⑿它们旨在维持家庭事务的秩序、提供相互帮助。每一个有孩子、家庭教师和其他家政人员的家庭都是一个大社会的缩影。社会是由众多家庭组成的，如同总体由部分组成。而且，正如大社会的福祉取决于它的秩序，小社会的福祉同样取决于它的秩序。因此，就像在一个综合性社会，地方法官关心的是检查并规定秩序的存在和维护，夫妻在他们的具体社会也是如此。然而，如果丈夫与妻子性格不合，这种秩序是不可能的。因为这时，他们给予彼此的建议和帮助就像他们的性格那样朝相反的方向拉扯，并产生分歧；因而这个小社会形态四分五裂。因此，为了维持秩序，并由此维持为他们自己，同时为他们的家庭，或为他们的家庭，同时为他们自己的供应，使他们不至于走向毁灭，仓促崩溃，男主人和女主人必须协商一致，行如一体。如果这一切由于他们心智的差异而无法实现，又要保持良好的秩序，那么对夫妻来说，表现友好的画面是必要和适当的。众所周知，为了必需品和它们所提供的功用，家庭事务上的和谐一致就要这样拼凑起来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #283 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>283. (xii) They are intended to keep proper order in household affairs and to provide mutual help.<p>Each household which also contains children, their teachers and other domestics is a community modelled on the large one. This comes into being by their combination, like any whole out of its parts. Moreover, just as the healthy condition of a major community depends upon its order, so does that of this minor one. As therefore it is the business of magistrates to examine and provide that order exists and is preserved in the people who compose the community, so it is that of the married couple in their own household. But this order is impossible, if husband and wife disagree in character, since this results in their advice and help given to each other pulling in opposite directions, and being divided like their characters; thus the form of the minor community is torn apart. In order, therefore, to keep order, and by this means to provide for oneself together with the household, or for the household together with oneself, so that they are not destroyed and rush headlong into ruin, it is essential for the master and mistress to agree and act as one. If the difference between their minds prevents this from happening, still to keep good order it is necessary and proper for the couple to display a picture of friendship. It is well known that concord is patched up <sup >1</sup>in households for the sake of needs and the uses they serve. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #283 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>283. 12. They are adopted to preserve order in the couple's domestic affairs and to maintain their assistance to each other. Every household that includes children, their tutors and other domestic help is a miniature society resembling the larger one. The larger one, indeed, consists of these smaller units, as a whole formed of its parts; and as the welfare of the larger society depends on the presence of order, so also does the welfare of this smaller society. Consequently, as it is important for civil officers to keep watch and see to it that order exists and is preserved in the collective society, so it is important for married partners to do the same in their individual society.<p>This order, however, is not possible if husband and wife differ in spirit; for their offerings of mutual counsel and aid are drawn by these differences in divergent directions and become as divided as the partners are in spirit, on which account the form of a little society is rent asunder. To preserve order, therefore, and by this means to protect themselves and at the same time their household, or their household and at the same time themselves, so that they do not go to ruin and collapse in disaster, necessity requires that master and mistress agree and act in harmony. Even if they cannot do this owing to their difference of minds, still for all to be well it is both fitting and proper that they achieve it by a representative show of conjugial friendship. People know that agreements in household matters are thus patched together for reasons that are necessary and therefore useful. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #283 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>283. 12. Pretenses do keep order in the home and allow the partners to help each other. Every household with children, their tutors, and other servants, is a society like society at large, which indeed emerges from this like a whole from its parts. And the welfare of this small society depends on order just as the welfare of the large one does. So, just as it is up to the leaders to discern and foresee how to have order and keep it, in a complex society, it is up to married partners to do it in their private one. But you cannot have this order if the husband and wife are of different minds, because it draws their discussions and help for each other in different directions, divided like their minds. This tears the arrangement of the small society apart. Therefore, to keep order and watch out for themselves and their household at the same time (or their household and themselves), so that it does not go to ruin and rush into disaster, the two in charge have to agree and work together. If they cannot do this by being of one mind, at least they should do it by putting on a show of marital friendship. This is fitting and proper. It makes things go well. It brings households into agreement for practical necessities, as everyone knows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #283 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>283. XII. THAT THEY ARE FOR THE SAKE OF PRESERVING ORDER IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, AND FOR THE SAKE OF MUTUAL AID. Every home where there are children with their tutors and other domestics is a society emulative of a larger society; the latter, moreover, comes into existence from a number of the former, just as what is general exists from its parts. Just as the welfare of the large society depends on order, so also does the welfare of the small society. Therefore, as, in a composite society, it concerns the magistrates to see and provide that order shall exist and be preserved, so with married partners in their particular society. This order, however, is not possible if husband and wife are of dissentient dispositions, for then the counsels and aids of the partners are distraught and divided, as are their dispositions, and the form of the little society is thus rent asunder. Wherefore, for the preservation of order and the providing thereby for themselves and at the same time for their household, or for their household and at the same time for themselves that they do not come to ruin and rush to destruction, necessity demands that the master and mistress be in accord and make a one; and if this cannot be effected because of a difference of minds, then, if it is to be well with them, it is needful and proper that this accord be effected by a representative conjugial friendship. That thereby concordance is imposed in homes because of necessities and hence of utilities is well known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #283 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>283. (xii) They are for the sake of maintaining order in domestic affairs, and for the sake of mutual helpfulness. Every house where there are children, and tutors for them, and other domestics, is a copy of society at large. Society at large is also composed of these smaller societies, as anything general is composed of parts. And as the welfare of society at large depends on order, so does the welfare of this small society. Accordingly, just as it concerns magistrates to see and provide that order shall exist and be maintained in the composite society, so it behooves married partners in their especial society. But order is not possible if husband and wife disagree in mind, for then mutual counsel and aid are borne asunder and are as divided as their minds are, and thus the form of the small society is rent asunder. To keep order, therefore, and to provide thereby for oneself and at the same time for the home, or for the home and at the same time for oneself, lest all go to ruin and come to disaster, necessity demands that master and mistress agree and make one; that if it cannot be done on account of mental difference, still for well-being it must and ought to be accomplished through an enacted marital friendship. It is known that concord in the home is contrived out of necessity and for usefulness' sake. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #283 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>283. (12) That they are for the sake of preserving order in domestic affairs, and for mutual help. Every house where there are children with their instructors, and other domestics, is a society emulative of the large society. This in fact has its existence from such, as a whole from its parts; and just as the welfare of a great society depends upon order, so does the welfare of this small society depend upon order. Wherefore, just as it concerns the magistrates in a composite society to see and provide that order shall exist and be preserved, so does it concern married partners in their particular society. But this order cannot be if the husband and wife disagree in mind, for then mutual counsel and mutual aid are, like their minds, distraught and dissevered, and the form of the small society is thus rent asunder. Therefore, for the preservation of order, and thereby to provide at once for themselves and for their household, or for their household and at the same time for themselves, that they do not come to hurt and rush to destruction, necessity requires that the master and mistress of the house agree and make one; that if this cannot be, on account of mental difference, still, in order that it may be well it ought to be done, and it also is becoming that this should be done, by representative conjugial friendship. That thereby harmony is secured in houses, for the sake of necessities and thence of utilities, is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #283 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>283. XII: Quod sint propter <sup>1</sup>ordinem servandum in rebus domesticis; et propter mutuum auxilium. Unaquaevis domus, ubi etiam liberi, horum instructores, et domestici alii, est una societas aemulans magnam; haec etiam ex illis, sicut commune ex partibus, coexistit; et quoque sicut salus societatis magnae dependet ex ordine, ita salus societatis hujus parvae ex ordine; quare quemadmodum interest personis magistratus dispicere et prospicere, ut sit et servetur ordo in Societate composita, ita conjugibus in singulari sua: sed hic ordo non dabilis est, si maritus et uxor animis dissident, per id enim mutua consilia et auxilia in diversum trahuntur, ac dividuntur sicut animi, et sic discinditur forma parvae societatis; quare ad servandum ordinem, et per illum ad prospiciendum sibi et simul domui, aut domui et simul sibi, ne in pessum eant, et in perniciem ruant, necessitas postulat, ut dominus et domina concordent, ac unum faciant; quod si non potest fieri propter discrimen mentium, usque ut bene sit, oportet et quoque decet, ut id fiat per repraesentativam amicitiam conjugialem; quod inde concordiae in domibus consarciantur <sup>2</sup>propter necessitates et inde utilitates, notum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: prorter<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: confarciantur </p>
