<h4 align="center"></h4><p>371、⑼对彼此温柔相爱的夫妻来说，嫉妒是一种出于正当理由的正当悲伤，唯恐他们的婚姻之爱破裂，因而灭亡。每种爱都包含恐惧和悲伤：唯恐它被毁灭，若被毁灭就会悲伤。婚姻之爱同样如此，只是它的恐惧和悲伤被称作热情和嫉妒。对彼此恩爱的夫妻来说，热情是正当的，背后有合理的理由；这是因为，它同时也是对失去永恒幸福的恐惧，不仅是自己的，还有对方的，还因为它是反对奸淫的一道防线。至于第一点，即它是对失去自己和对方永恒幸福的一种正当恐惧，这一点从目前有关真正婚姻之爱的所有论述和以下事实可推知：这爱是他们灵魂的祝福、心智的幸福、内心的快乐和身体的愉悦之源头。由于这些永远与他们同在，所以它对二者的永恒幸福来说是一种恐惧。显然，这种热情是反对奸淫的一种正当防卫。因此，它就像一团熊熊燃烧的烈火，以反对任何侵犯，并保护自己免受侵犯。显而易见，深爱妻子的男人也会嫉妒；不过，这嫉妒若与这个男人的智慧相符，也是正当和理智的。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>371、（9）在彼此相爱的配偶中，嫉妒是一种有正当原因的苦恼，因为害怕他们的婚姻之爱会受害并丧失。每种爱都有与之同在的畏惧和焦虑——害怕这种爱会消失。真正的婚姻之爱也是这样。只不过是它的畏惧和焦虑被称为热情zeal和嫉妒。</p><p>这种热情在相互相爱的配偶中是有其正当理由的。因为它同时是一种对失去永远的幸福的畏惧，因为它也是防止奸淫的一种保护作用。</p><p>关于第一点，害怕失去双方永恒的幸福这点可以从从前关于真正的婚姻之爱的章节中看到。从婚姻之爱而产生了对他们灵魂的祝福，他们头脑的快乐以躯体的快乐。因为这些永远属于他们，所以他们害怕丧失这些。</p><p>所以这种热情只是为了反对奸淫。</p><p>所以相爱的人是嫉妒的，但是是根据男人的智慧而出于合理的原因。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #371 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>371. (ix) Jealousy in the case of married couples who love each other dearly is a justified grief arising from a proper reason, a fear that their conjugial love may be split and thus destroyed.<p>Every love contains fear and grief: fear of it being destroyed, and grief if it is. Likewise conjugial love, but its fear and grief are called zeal and jealousy. The reason why, in the case of couples who dearly love each other that zeal is justified and has sound reason behind it, is that it is at the same time fear of the loss of everlasting happiness, not only one's own, but one's partner's too, and because it is a defence against adultery.<p>As regards the first point, that it is a justified fear of losing one's own and one's partner's everlasting happiness, this is the consequence of everything which has so far been reported about truly conjugial love, and of the fact that this love is the source of the blessedness of their souls, the cheerfulness of their minds, the delights of their hearts and the pleasure of their bodies. Since these remain with them for ever, it is a fear for the everlasting happiness of them both. It is obvious that this zeal is a justified defence against adultery. As a result it is like a fire blazing out against any infringement, and protecting itself against it. It is evident that one who dearly loves his wife is also jealous, but with justification and reasonably if this accords with the man's wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #371 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>371. 9. In married partners who love each other tenderly, jealousness is a just anguish in accord with sound reason, that their conjugial love not be sundered and thus perish. Every love carries with it a fear and anguish - a fear of its perishing, and anguish if it does. The same is true of conjugial love, only its fear and anguish are called zeal and jealousness.<p>Such a zeal in married partners who love each other tenderly is just and in accord with sound reason, because it is at the same time a fear of losing eternal happiness, not only one's own, but the partner's as well, and because it is also a protection against adultery.<p>As regards the first point, that it is a just fear of losing eternal happiness, both one's own and one's partner's - this follows from everything we have presented previously concerning truly conjugial love, and from the fact that from conjugial love comes the blessedness of their souls, the happiness of their minds, the delight of their breasts, and the pleasure of their bodies. And because these continue for them to eternity, it is a fear for the couple's eternal happiness.<p>That such a zeal is a just protection against adulterous affairs, is obvious. On that account it is like a fire blazing out against any encroachment and protecting itself against it.<p>It is apparent from this that anyone who loves his partner tenderly is also jealous, but justly and soundly so, in the measure of the man's wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #371 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>371. 9. In those partners who love each other tenderly, jealousy is a justified anguish, from sound reason, lest married love become divided and perish as a result. There is fear and pain in every love - fear that it might be lost and pain if it is lost. The love in marriage is no different, but its fear and pain are called zeal, or jealousy. In married couples who tenderly love each other this zeal is justified and based on sound reason, because it is fear for the loss of eternal happiness - not just your own, but your partner's, too - and at the same time because it is a protection against adultery.<p>As to the first point, that it is a righteous fear of losing your eternal happiness and your partner's, this follows from everything that has been brought up so far about the genuine love in marriage, and from the fact that the blessedness of a couple's souls, their minds' happiness, their hearts' joys, and their bodies' pleasure come from that love. And because these things are theirs forever, each fears for the other's eternal happiness.<p>It is obvious that this zeal is a rightful protection against adultery. Therefore it is like a fire flaring up against violation and guarding against it.<p>These things establish that someone who loves his mate tenderly is jealous as well, but it is right and healthy according to the man's wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #371 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>371. IX. THAT WITH MARRIED PARTNERS WHO TENDERLY LOVE EACH OTHER, JEALOUSY IS A JUST GRIEF FROM SOUND REASON, LEST THEIR CONJUGIAL LOVE BE DIVIDED AND THUS PERISH. Within all love is fear and grief, fear lest it perish, and grief if it does perish. There is the like fear and grief in conjugial love, but the fear and grief of this love is called zeal or jealousy. That with partners who tenderly love each other this zeal is just and from sound reason, is because it is at the same time fear for the loss of eternal felicity, not only his own but also his partner's; and because it is also a protection against adultery. As regards the first point--that it is a just fear for the loss of his own and his partner's eternal felicity--this follows from all that has hitherto been advanced respecting love truly conjugial, and also from the fact that from that love comes the blessedness of their souls, the happiness of their minds, the delight of their bosoms, and the pleasure of their bodies; and because these remain with them to eternity, there is fear for each other's eternal happiness. [As regards the second point]--that the zeal is a just protection against adulteries--this is evident; therefore it is as a fire blazing out against violation and defending itself against it. From this it is evident that one who tenderly loves his partner is also jealous; but the jealousy is just and sane according to the wisdom of the man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #371 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>371. (ix) In partners who love each other tenderly jealousy is a right anxiety from sound reason lest marital love be sundered and thus perish. In all love there is fear and grief - fear lest it perish, and grief if it does. Such fear and grief, found in marital love, are called zeal or jealousy. In the case of partners who love each other tenderly, this zeal is right and from sound reason, for it is at once a fear for the loss of eternal felicity, not only one's own but the partner's, too, and likewise a protection against adultery. As for the first point, that it is a right fear for the loss of one's own and the partner's eternal felicity, this follows from everything which we have advanced so far about true marital love, also from the consideration that from this love come blessedness of soul, happiness of mind, the delight of the bosom and the pleasure of the body. As all these may be theirs to eternity, there is fear for each other's eternal happiness. That this zeal is a due protection against adulteries is obvious; hence it is like a fire blazing out against violation and warding it off. From this it is plain that one who loves his partner tenderly is also jealous, but justly and sanely so in the measure of his wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #371 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>371. (9) That jealousy with those married partners who tenderly love each other is a just grief, from sound reason, lest conjugial love be divided and so perish. Fear and grief are inherent in all love, fear lest it perish, and grief if it perish. The same are inherent in conjugial love, but its fear and grief are called zeal, or jealousy. That zeal with married partners who tenderly love each other is just, and of sound reason, is because it is at the same time fear for the loss of eternal happiness, not its own only, but that of the married partner also; and because it is likewise protection against adultery. As regard the first, that it is a just fear for the loss of eternal happiness, its own and that of the married partner, it follows from all that has hitherto been advanced respecting love truly conjugial, and from these considerations: That from that love comes the blessedness of their souls, the satisfaction of their minds, the delight of their bosoms, and the pleasure of their bodies; and as these abide with them to eternity, the fear is for the eternal happiness of both. That the zeal is a just protection against adultery is plain. Hence it is as a fire flaming against violation; and defending against it. From these considerations it is evident that whoever tenderly loves his married partner is also jealous, but just and sane, according to the wisdom of the man. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #371 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>371. IX. Quod Zelotypia apud illos conjuges, qui se tenere amant, sit justus dolor ex sana ratione, ne amor conjugialis dividatur, et sic pereat. Omni amori inest timor et dolor, timor ne pereat, et dolor si perit; simile inest amori conjugiali; sed timor et dolor ejus vocatur Zelus aut Zelotypia. Quod Zelus ille apud conjuges, qui se tenere amant, sit justus et ex sana ratione, est quia simul est timor pro jactura aeternae felicitatis, non modo suae sed etiam conjugis, et quia etiam est tutamen contra adulterium: quod primum attinet, <sup>1</sup>quod sit justus timor pro jactura aeternae felicitatis suae et conjugis, sequitur ex omnibus, quae de Amore vere conjugiali hactenus allata sunt; et ex his, quod ex illo amore sit animarum illorum beatitudo, mentium illorum faustitas, pectorum jucunditas, et corporum voluptas; et quia haec illis in aeternum manent, est timor utriusque felicitatis aeternae. Quod Zelus ille sit justum tutamen contra adulteria, patet; inde est sicut ignis contra violationem efflagrans, et contra illam se tutans. Ex his constat, quod qui tenere amat conjugem, etiam Zelotypus sit, at secundum sapientiam viri justus et sanus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: adtinet, </p>
