<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第142节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>142、⑶唯有基督徒的婚姻才是贞洁的。这是因为，真正的婚姻之爱与人里面教会的状态是同步发展的，并且这爱出自主（如130，131等节所述）。还因为，拥有真正真理的教会就是拥有圣言的教会，主在那里就存在于这些真理中。由此可知，贞洁的婚姻只可能存在于基督教界，即使不存在，仍有存在的可能。基督徒的婚姻意味着一个男人与一个妻子的婚姻。在适当的地方我们会看到，这类婚姻能植入基督徒，并通过遗传从享有真正婚姻之爱的父母传给他们的后代；同时由此出现一种在教会和天堂的事上变得智慧的先天能力和倾向。基督徒若娶数位妻子，不仅犯下属世的奸淫罪，还犯下属灵的奸淫罪，这一点将在一夫多妻那一章予以说明。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>142、（3）只有基督教式的婚姻才是贞节的。这是因为真正的婚姻之爱会随着一个人身上的教会状态的上升而上升。另外，拥有真理的教会也就是拥有主的圣经，主的话，主就体现在圣经之中。</p><p>这就是为什么贞节的婚姻关系存在于基督教式的婚姻关系中，即使它不存在那儿，它在这种婚姻关系中也是有存在的可能的。这里所说的基督教式的婚姻关系是指一夫一妻的关系。在以后章节中将进一步讲到，这种婚姻关系能够深植于基督徒中并能够将父母亲的真正的婚姻之爱传递给后代，同时我们还会看到生来基督徒就有一种对与教会及天堂相关事物的倾向，有变得有智慧的能力。</p><p>如果基督徒有多个妻子，那么他就是在自然和精神上都是不贞节的，这点在以后一夫多妻章节中会讲到。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #142 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>142. (iii) Only Christian marriage can be chaste.<p>This is because truly conjugial love advances in step with the state of the church with a person, and because this comes from the Lord (as shown in the previous chapter, <a href="130.htm">130-131</a> and elsewhere). It is also because the church is in its real truths in the Word, and the Lord is there present in them. It follows from these statements that chaste marriage is only possible in the Christian world, and even if it does not exist, it is still possible. Christian marriage means the marriage of one man with one wife. It will be seen in due course that this kind of marriage can be implanted in Christians, and be passed on to their children by inheritance from parents who enjoy truly conjugial love; and that there arises at the same time both the ability and the inclination to be wise about matters concerning the church and heaven. If Christians marry more than one wife, they commit not only natural, but also spiritual adultery, as will be shown in the chapter on polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #142 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>142. 3. Only a Christian conjugial relationship is chaste. This is because truly conjugial love advances in a person in the same degree as the state of the church in him and because that love is from the Lord (as we showed in the preceding chapter, nos. <a href="130.htm">130</a>, <a href="131.htm">131</a>, and elsewhere). Furthermore, a church in possession of its genuine truths is a church that possesses the Word, and it is there in those truths that the Lord is present.<p>It follows from this that a chaste conjugial relationship does not exist except in the Christian world, and if it does not exist, that still it is possible. By a Christian conjugial relationship we mean a marriage of one man with one wife. We will see in its own place <sup >1</sup>that this conjugial state can become implanted in Christians, and that it can be passed on hereditarily to offspring by parents who are in a state of truly conjugial love. We will see also that from it is born at the same time both a capacity and an inclination to become wise in things that have to do with the church and heaven.<p>If Christians marry more than one wife, they commit not only natural adultery but spiritual adultery as well, as we will show in the chapter on polygamy. <sup >2</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="202.htm">202</a> ff.<p>2.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="332.htm">332</a> ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #142 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>142. 3. Marriage can be chaste only if Christian. This is because the real love of marriage a person has keeps pace with the state of religion in him, and he gets this from the Lord (as earlier discussions have shown - nos. 130-31, and elsewhere). It is also because religion's genuine truths are in the Word, and the Lord is present in them there. This means that there can be chaste marriage only in the Christian world. If it is not there, at least it can be there.<p>Christian marriage means marriage of one man and one wife.<p>In the proper place it will come out that this marriage can be implanted in Christians and pass to children by heredity from parents who have the real love of marriage, and that it can yield an innate ability and inclination to understand religious and heavenly things.<p>The chapter on polygamy will show that if Christians have more wives than one, they commit adultery not only on the worldly level but the spiritual level as well. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #142 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>142. III. THAT THE CHRISTIAN CONJUGIAL ALONE IS CHASTE, is because love truly conjugial in man keeps equal pace with the state of the Church with him; and, as shown in the preceding chapter, nos. <a href="130.htm">130, 131</a>, and elsewhere, this state is from the Lord; also because the Church is in the Word in its genuine truths, it being in these that the Lord is present there. From this it follows, that there is no chaste conjugial except in the Christian world; and that if it is not there, it is nevertheless possible. By the Christian conjugial is meant the marriage of one man with one wife. That this conjugial can be implanted among Christians and by inheritance can descend from parents who are in love truly conjugial to their offspring, and that from it arises a connate ability and inclination to become wise in the things of the Church and heaven, will be seen in its proper place. That Christians, if they marry more wives than one, commit not only natural but also spiritual adultery, will be shown in the chapter on Polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #142 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>142. (iii) The Christian marital tendency alone occurs chaste, because true marital love advances in man step for step with the state of the Church in him, and because that state is from the Lord (shown in the preceding section, nn. 130-131, and elsewhere); also, because the Church in its genuine truths is in the Word, and the Lord is present in those truths there. Hence it follows that chaste marital tendency is found only in Christendom, or at least can occur only there. By the Christian marital tendency is meant marriage of one man with one wife. This marital tendency can be implanted in Christians, and devolve by heredity on the offspring of parents who are in true marital love. There are born of it also both a faculty and an inclination for being wise in the things of heaven and the Church, as will be seen in its place. Christians who marry more than one wife commit not only natural adultery, but spiritual adultery also, as will be demonstrated in the chapter on "Polygamy." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #142 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>142. (3) That only the Christian Conjugial is chaste, is because love truly conjugial in man proceeds at an equal pace with the state of the church with man; and because that state is from the Lord, as has been shown in the preceding chapter (n. <a href="130.htm">130-131</a>) and elsewhere; also because the church in its genuine truths is in the Word, and in them the Lord is present there. From this it follows that there is no chaste conjugial except in the Christian world; and if it be not there, it is yet possible there. By the Christian conjugial is meant the marriage of one man with one wife. That this conjugial can become inherent among Christians, and by inheritance descend to the offspring from parents who are in love truly conjugial, and that from this a faculty and an inclination to become wise in the things of the church and of heaven may become connate, will be seen in its proper place.<p>That if Christians marry more wives than one, they commit not only natural but also spiritual adultery, will be shown in the chapter on Polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #142 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>142. III: Quod Conjugiale Christianum solummodo detur castum, est quia Amor vere conjugialis simili passu vadit apud hominem, in quo status Ecclesiae apud illum, et quia ille est a Domino, ut in Transactione praecedente <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_142/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_130" target=_top>130</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_142/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_131" target=_top>131</a> et alibi, ostensum est; tum quia Ecclesia in genuinis suis veris est in Verbo, et Dominus ibi in illis praesens est; ex his sequitur, quod non detur Conjugiale castum, quam in Christiano Orbe, et quod si non datur, usque sit dabile: per Conjugiale Christianum intelligitur Conjugium unius Viri cum una Uxore. Quod hoc Conjugiale possit fieri insitum Christianis, et haereditario sequi in proles a Parentibus, qui in Amore vere conjugiali sunt, et quod ex illo connascatur et facultas et inclinatio ad sapiendum illa quae Ecclesiae et Coeli sunt, in suo loco videbitur. Quod Christiani, si plures uxores ducunt, non modo adulterium naturale, sed etiam adulterium spirituale, committant, in Transactione de Polygamia demonstrabitur. </p>
