<h4 align="center"></h4><p>117、⑴在圣言中，主被称为新郎和丈夫，教会被称为新娘和妻子；主与教会的结合，并教会与主的相互结合被称为婚姻。在圣言中，主被称为新郎和丈夫，教会被称为新娘和妻子，这从以下经文明显看出来:<br><br>娶新妇的就是新郎，新郎的朋友，就是那站着听他的，听见新郎的声音，新郎的朋友站着，听见新郎的声音就欢喜快乐。（约翰福音3:29）<br><br>施洗约翰这句话说的是主。<br><br>耶稣说，新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，岂能叫陪伴之人禁食呢？但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食了。（马太福音9:15;马可福音2:19，20;路加福音5:34，35）<br><br>我看见圣城新耶路撒冷，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。（启示录21:2）<br><br>新耶路撒冷是指主的新教会（参看《揭秘启示录》880，881节）。<br><br>天使对约翰说:你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你。他将圣城耶路撒冷指示我。（启示录21:9，10）<br><br>羔羊的婚期到了，祂的妻子也自己预备好了，凡被请赴羔羊之婚筵的有福了！（启示录19:7，9）<br><br>五个童女预备好了在路上迎接新郎，同祂进去赴婚筵。（马太福音25:1-10）<br><br>新郎就是主，这一点从13节明显看出来，在那里，经上说:<br><br>所以，你们要警醒，因为人子要来的那日子，那时辰，你们不知道。（马太福音25:13）<br><br>此外还有先知书中的许多经文。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>117、（1）在《圣经》中主被称做新郎及丈夫，教会被称为新娘及妻子，主和教会的相互联系及教会和主的相互联系被称为婚姻。从以下段落中可以看到在《圣经》中主被称为新郎及丈夫，教会被称为新娘及妻子：</p><p>娶新妇的就是新郎，新郎的朋友站着，听见新郎的声音就甚喜悦。</p><p>（《约翰福音》3:29）</p><p>另见（《马太福音》9:15  《马可福音》2:19、20， 《路和福音》5:34，35），及（《启示录》21:2，21:9、10  ，19:7，9）</p><p>（《马太福音》25:1—10，25:13）</p><p>相似的段落还有很多。</p>

<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #117 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>117. 1. The Word calls the Lord a Bridegroom and Husband and the church a bride and wife, and it says the Lord's union with the church and the reciprocal union of the church with the Lord is a marriage. The following passages establish the fact that in the Word the Lord is called Bridegroom and Husband and the church bride and wife:<p>He who has the bride is the Bridegroom. But the friend of the Bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with great joy at the Bridegroom's voice. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_29.htm">John 3:29</a>)<p>John the Baptist said this about the Lord.<p>Jesus said, So long as the Bridegroom is with them the sons of the wedding cannot fast.
