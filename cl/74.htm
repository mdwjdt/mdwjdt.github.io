<h4 align="center"></h4><p>74、这六个灵界记事涉及婚姻之爱，它们揭示了在第一个时代、随后的时代和当今时代，婚姻之爱各是怎样的状况。由此清楚可知，这爱从其圣洁和纯真逐渐堕落，最终变得淫乱。尽管如此，它仍有复归其原始或古时之圣洁的希望。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>74、这六点是来自于精神世界关于婚姻的情况。描述了那时是什么样及以后和今天各是什么样。很明显，这种爱逐渐地远离纯净和圣洁，变得 充满色欲，但是还有返回到它原始时代的圣洁状态的希望。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #74 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>74. These six accounts of conjugial love from the spiritual world reveal the nature of that love in the earliest times, in the subsequent period, and as it is today. It is evident from this that this love gradually declined from its holiness and purity, until it became scortatory. There is, however, some hope that it may be brought back to its pristine or ancient holiness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #74 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>74. These six accounts come from the spiritual world, on the subject of conjugial love, and they reveal what that love was like in the first ages, and what it was like afterwards, and what it is like today. It is apparent from them that that love gradually moved away from its holiness and purity, until it became licentious; but that there is still hope of its returning to its pristine or ancient holiness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #74 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>74. These six stories about married love, which are from the spiritual world, show what that love was like in the first age, what it was like after that, and what it is like today. They establish that this love gradually receded from its holiness and purity to the point where it has become fornication. But there is hope of its restoration to its original or ancient holiness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #74 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>74. These six Memorable Relations from the spiritual world concerning conjugial love reveal what the nature of that love was in the First Ages, what it was after those Ages, and what it is at the present day. From them it is evident that this love has successively fallen away from its holiness and purity until it has become scortatory, but that, nevertheless, there is hope of its being brought back to its primeval or ancient holiness. <sup >1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original edition, this paragraph is enclosed in inverted commas. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #74 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>74. These six Memorabilia - from the spiritual world about marital love - disclose the nature of marital love in the early eras, its nature later, and also its quality today. It is evident from the narratives that that love has declined step by step in holiness and purity, until it has become scortatory; but still that there is hope of its restoration to its primeval or ancient holiness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #74 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>74. These six Relations respecting conjugial love - which are from the spiritual world - reveal what the quality of that love was in the earliest ages; what it was after those ages; and what it is at this day. From which it appears that this love has gradually fallen away from its holiness and purity until it has become scortatory; but that nevertheless there is hope of its being brought back again to its primeval or ancient holiness. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #74 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>74. Haec Sex Memorabilia, quae sunt e Mundo Spirituali de Amore Conjugiali, revelant qualis ille Amor fuerat in Primis Aevis, et qualis post illa, et qualis hodie est; ex quibus constat, quod ille Amor a sanctitate et puritate sua successive recesserit, usque dum factus est scortatorius; sed quod tamen sit spes reductionis ejus in primaevam seu antiquam suam Sanctitatem. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Haec paragraphus in prima editione signis citationis inclusa est. </p>
