<h4 align="center"></h4><p>474、⑽重大理由若非基于公义，即便表面看似公义，也是不纯正的。这些能从上面所列举的纯正重大理由得知。若不细查，它们看似公义，其实不然。例如：分娩后需要一段时间的禁欲；妻子暂时的疾病；无论由这些还是其它原因造成的生殖能力的损耗；以色列人可以一夫多妻，以及其它从公义的角度看没有可取之处的理由。它们都是男人或丈夫变得冷淡后杜撰出来的理由，因为此时，不贞洁的淫欲使他们丧失了婚姻之爱，并以婚姻之爱与淫乱之爱一样这种观点冲昏他们的头脑。这种男人在找情妇或纳妾时，为避免丧失名声，会将这类虚假、骗人的理由说成恰当、纯正的理由。他们绝大部分会散布有关妻子的谣言，善意使得他们同胞当中的朋友信以为真，还加以美化。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>474、（10）以上所列举的原因若没有被认真判断，可能表面上看象是真的原因，而实际上却不然。比如：生完孩子后的节欲。妻子暂时的疾病。以色列人中所允 许的一夫多妻制。以及其它类似原因。它们是男人变得冷漠后发生的原因，这时的男人放荡的情欲控制，认为婚姻之爱是与淫爱相似，若这样的男人与情人交往，为避免非论，他会编造错误原因，欺骗妻子，这会被与他关似的朋友所接受。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #474 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>474. (x) The weighty reasons which are not genuine are those which are unjust, although they appear to be just.<p>These can be recognised from the list of genuinely weighty reasons given above, but they may seem to be just, though they are not, unless they are duly investigated. For instance, the claim for a period of abstinence needed after childbirth, wives' passing ailments, wastage of reproductive powers, whether due to these or not, the polygamy allowed to the Israelites, and other such reasons which are without merit from the point of view of justice. These reasons are invented by husbands after they have become frigid, when unchaste lusts have robbed them of conjugial love and infatuated them with the notion that it is similar to scortatory love. These men on taking a concubine make false and deceptive reasons of this sort into true and genuine ones to avoid ill-repute; they mostly spread around lying rumours about their wives, and good will makes their friends among their fellow-citizens accept these as true and embroider them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #474 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>474. 10. But weighty reasons that are not real are ones which are not founded on justice, even though on an appearance of justice. Such reasons are recognized in the light of the real weighty reasons listed above - reasons which, if they are not properly examined, may appear to be just, and yet be unjust. As for example: The requirement of periods of abstinence following childbirth. The transitory illnesses of wives. The expenditures of seminal fluid resulting from these and other causes. The polygamous marriages permitted to the Israelites. And other like considerations, which have no validity in the light of justice. They are reasons invented by men after contracting states of coldness, when unchaste lusts have deprived them of their conjugial love and infatuated them with the idea of that love's being akin to licentious love. When men like that go to take a mistress, they make such spurious and fallacious reasons to be germane and genuine, usually intermixing in with them, too, lies about the wife, which are also accepted and repeated by friends and acquaintances in the measure of their favorable disposition toward these men. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #474 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>474. 10. But the serious reasons that are specious are the ones that are not just but yet appear to be just. You can tell these from the real, important reasons listed above. They can seem just, if not duly examined, and yet are unjust - reasons like the time of abstinence required after birth, a wife's temporary afflictions, the waste of sperm on that and other accounts, the polygamy permitted the Israelites, and other similar reasons with no basis in justice. Men fabricate them after they become cold when unchaste passions have taken away their married love and made fools of them with the notion that married love is illicit love. When these men take up with a concubine, they make these counterfeit and false reasons valid and genuine to save face. And they usually spread rumors about their wives, which their social friends sympathetically support and celebrate. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #474 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>474. X. THAT WEIGHTY CAUSES ARE UNREAL WHEN NOT BASED ON WHAT IS JUST, EVEN THOUGH ON AN APPEARANCE THERE OF. These are learned from the real weighty causes recounted above. If not rightly scrutinized, they may appear as just and yet are not just. Thus: Periods of abstinence requisite after childbirth; transitory illness of the wife; outflows of the prolific fluid whether from this cause or not; the polygamy permitted the Israelites. These and other like causes are of no validity when viewed from justice. They are causes made up by men after cold has been contracted and unchaste lusts have deprived them of conjugial love and infatuated them with an idea of its likeness to scortatory love. When they enter into concubinage, such men, in order to avoid loss of reputation, make spurious and fallacious causes of this sort to be pertinent and genuine causes. For the most part, they also spread lies about the wife, and these are assented to and sung out by friendly fellow-citizens according as they favor the husbands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #474 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>474. (x) Weighty causes not real are such as do not rest on justice, though they seem to do so. These are to be recognized from the weighty real causes recounted above. If not well scrutinized, they may appear just when they are not; as that there are periods of abstinence inevitable after childbirth; transitory illnesses of the wife, and thence and from other causes loss of the prolific fluid; the permission of polygamy to the Israelites; and other like causes of no validity in justice. These causes are put forward by men after cold has sprung up in them and unchaste lusts have deprived them of marital love and infatuated them with the idea that marital love is like scortatory love. When such men enter on concubinage they make true and genuine causes out of these spurious and fallacious ones in order not to lose standing, and also commonly sprinkle in false ones about their wives, which are endorsed and echoed by the friends in society whom they favor. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #474 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>474. (10) That weighty causes not real are such as are not from what is just, although from an appearance of what is just. These are recognised from the real weighty causes recounted above. If not rightly scrutinized they may appear just and yet be unjust. For example, the times of abstinence that are requisite after parturition; transitory illnesses of the wife, and thence and from other causes loss of fecundity; the permission of polygamy to the Israelites; and other like excuses of no validity from justice. These reasons are framed by men after they have contracted coldness, when unchaste lusts have deprived them of conjugial love and infatuated them with an idea of its likeness to scortatory love. These men, when they enter into concubinage, pretend that such spurious and fallacious causes are true and genuine, lest they suffer in reputation; and commonly they also spread abroad falsehoods about the wife, and these are assented to and bruited abroad by their social friends, according to favor. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #474 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>474. X. Quod causae sonticae non reales, sint quae non ex justo sunt, tametsi ex apparentia justi. Hae ex causis sonticis realibus supra recensitis cognoscuntur, quae si non rite explorantur, apparere possunt ut justae, et tamen injustae sunt; sicut quod tempora abstinentiae post partus requisita sint, aegritudines transitoriae uxorum, inde et non inde dispendia prolifici, polygamiae permissae Israelitis, et similes aliae nullius valoris ex justitia; hae effinguntur a viris post contracta frigora, dum incastae libidines deprivaverunt illos amore conjugiali, ac infatuarunt illos idea similitudinis ejus cum amore scortatorio: hi, dum concubinatum intrant, ne diffamentur, <sup>1</sup>causas tales spurias et fallaces faciunt germanas et genuinas, ut plurimum etiam de uxore mentitas inspergunt, quae etiam secundum favorem a civibus amicis assentiuntur et occentantur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: d ffamentur, </p>
