<h4 align="center"></h4><p>133、此后，他们着手讨论第二个问题：为何人生来没有任何爱的知识，而动物和鸟类，无论高级还是低级，生来就有其一切爱的知识？首先，他们通过各种观察资料确认这个问题是事实。如，他们发现，人生来没有任何知识，甚至连婚姻之爱的知识都没有。他们作了调查，并从研究人员那里获悉：婴儿凭本能甚至不知道如何靠近母亲的乳房，不得不靠母亲或保姆的帮助；它只知道如何吸吮，而这也是因它在母亲子宫里不断吸吮才学会的；后来，婴儿不知道如何走路；也不知道如何调节声音，让它形成人类所说的话；它甚至还不如动物，知道如何用声音表达爱的情感；而且，它也不像所有动物那样知道哪些食物适合自己，而是碰见什么抓什么，无论干不干净，都往嘴里送。研究人员报告说，若不接受教导，人连男女都分不清，根本不懂如何做爱；甚至少男少女若不是由别人告知，也不知道这一点，尽管他们接受了各种技能的训练。总之，人生来纯粹是肉体，好比一条虫子。若不从别人那里学习如何获得知识、聪明和智慧，他仍是属肉体的。<br><br>然后，他们又证实了这种说法：动物，无论高级还是低级，包括地上的走兽，空中的飞鸟，各种爬行动物，鱼类和昆虫，生来就知道其生命之爱的一切知识。例如，它们知道关乎饮食、居所、交配、繁殖、抚育后代的一切。他们通过从在世时的所见所闻所读回想起的奇妙例子证实了这一切（他们将我们的世界，也就是他们先前生活的世界称为尘世，尘世的动物不是代表性的，而是真实的）。充分证明了该问题的真实性之后，他们把注意力转向调查并找出解释和阐明这个奥秘的目的和原因。他们一致声称，这类事必出自神性智慧，以确保人是人，动物是动物。因此，人与生俱来的不完美变得完美，而动物与生俱来的完美则变得不完美。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>133、此后，他们开始讨论第二个题目，为什么人生来没有生存所需的知识，技能，而动物、鸟类却不然。</p><p>首先，他们从各个角度考虑这个问题，以确认它确实是如此，从人来讲，人生来没有任何知识，更不知道与婚姻之爱相关的知识。</p><p>首先，他们从各个角度考虑这个问题，以确认它确实是如此，从人来讲，人生来没有任何知识，更不知道与婚姻之爱相关的知识。</p><p>他们还得知婴儿出生后，甚至不知道去找妈妈的奶吃，必须要有人帮助他们，他们才会学会。婴儿只会吮吸，这是他们在母亲体内时就一直在做的运动。孩子此后也不知道如何走路、如何说话、甚至也不知道象动物们那样发出声音来传达情感。孩子也不知道哪种食物对其有利，而动物却不然，孩子会吃所接触到的一切事物，无论是脏的还是干净的。</p><p>如果没人教孩子的话，人甚至不能区分男女，更谈不到人会爱对方，青年男女也是要从别的途径才能学会与异性的亲密关系。</p><p>总而言之，人类生来是属于肉体的，象虫类一样，除非受到教育，学会去获得知识，才智和智慧，否则人将会保持人的肉体状态。</p><p>关于动物、鸟类、爬行生物及昆虫，它们生来就有基本的生存技能，知道吃什么，住什么地方，如何生育后代等。</p><p>人们生动地用他们在自然世界（我们所生活的世间）时的记忆生动地讲述着以上内容。</p><p>讲完这些后，他们开始探寻这一事实的原因。他们认为这其中一定是神的智慧的安排，这样人出生时的不完美会变得完美，而动物出生时的完美会变得不完美。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #133 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>133. After this they took up the next subject for discussion: 'Why is man born without knowledge of what he should love, yet animals and birds, the highest as well as the lowest, are born knowing all that their loves require?'<p>First they established the truth of the proposition by various observations. For instance, that man is born without any knowledge, not even that of conjugial love. They made enquiry and learned from researchers that a baby does not even know by instinct how to approach its mother's breast, but has to be positioned by its mother or nurse; it only knows how to suck, and that is because it has learned this by continually sucking in its mother's womb. Later on, it does not know how to walk; or how to adapt the sounds it makes to form a word of human speech, not even how to express its emotions by sounds as animals do. Moreover, it does not know what food is suitable for it, as all animals do, but grabs anything it finds, whether clean or dirty, and puts it in its mouth. The researchers reported that without instruction man does not know how to distinguish the sexes, and has no knowledge at all of how to make love. Not even young men and women know about this without being told by others, although they have been trained in various skills. In short, a man is by birth merely bodily, like a worm; and he remains bodily, unless he learns from others how to know, understand and be wise.</p><p>[2] Then they established that both the higher and lower animals, land animals, birds of the air, reptiles, fish and insects are born knowing all that their loves require for their lives; for instance, everything they need to know about feeding, about where to live, how to copulate and produce young, and how to bring up their young. They established these facts by remarkable observations which they recalled to mind from what they had seen, heard and read in the natural world - as they called our world where they had previously lived - where the animals which exist are not representative but real. When they had fully proved the truth of this proposition, they turned their minds to seeking and finding the purposes and reasons which would explain and elucidate this question. They all asserted that these facts must be the result of divine wisdom, to ensure that human beings were human and that animals were animals. Thus the imperfections with which a man is born would become his perfection, and the perfection with which an animal is born would become its imperfection. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #133 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>133. After this they took up the second topic for discussion, why man does not come by birth into the knowledge necessary to any love, whereas both higher and lower animals and birds come by birth into the kinds of knowledge necessary to all their loves.<p>First they confirmed the truth of the proposed question by various considerations. With respect to man, for example, they observed that the human being does not come by birth into any knowledge, not even into knowledge relating to conjugial love.<p>They inquired as well and learned from investigators that an infant does not even possess the instinctive knowledge to be able to go to its mother's breast, but it must be placed in contact with it by the mother or nurse. It only knows how to suckle, and it got this from a continual sucking in the womb. The infant afterwards also does not know how to walk, the investigators said, nor how to articulate sound to form a single human word. Indeed, it does not even know how to voice the affection of its love as animals do. Moreover, it does not know any source of food that is good for it, either, as all animals do, but clutches at whatever it comes upon, whether it is clean or unclean, and puts it into its mouth.<p>Without being taught, the investigators said, the human being does not even know enough to distinguish the opposite sex, and nothing at all about how to make love to one. Even young men and women do not know how to make love without learning about it from others, even if they have been educated in the various arts and sciences.<p>In a word, the human being is born flesh, like a worm, and remains flesh unless he learns to acquire knowledge, intelligence and wisdom from others.</p><p>[2] Next, with respect to animals, such as beasts of the earth, birds of the sky, creeping things, fish, and little creatures called insects, the people confirmed that both higher and lower animals come by birth into all the kinds of knowledge necessary to their life's loves. They come, for example, into knowledge of all things having to do with their proper diet, with their place of habitation, with their mating and reproduction, and with the rearing of their young.<p>The people confirmed these observations with marvelous illustrations that they recalled to memory from things they had seen, heard or read about in the natural world (as they termed our world in which they had formerly lived), where animals are not representational but real.<p>After they had thus verified the truth of the proposed question, the people turned their attention to investigating and finding the ends and causes by which to explain and uncover the answer to this mystery. And they all said that this state of affairs must result from Divine wisdom, that a human being may be a human being, and an animal an animal; and that therefore man's imperfection from birth becomes his perfection, while an animal's perfection from birth is its imperfection. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #133 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>133. After this they took up the second object of discussion, "Why are people not born with any skill that love requires, when the birds and beasts, both noble and base, are born with the skills that all their loves require?"<p>First they affirmed the truth of the proposition in various ways, for example, that as for man, he is born without knowledge - not even the knowledge of the love in marriage. And they asked, and learned from expert witnesses that an infant cannot even get himself to his mother's nipple from inborn knowledge, but the mother or nurse must move him there. And all he knows is how to suck, and he learned this by constantly sucking in utero.<p>And later he does not know how to walk nor make a sound in any human language - not even express the feelings of his love, as animals can. Furthermore, he does not know what food is good for him, as animals do, but he grabs what he comes on, whether it is clean or not, and puts it in his mouth.<p>The experts said that without instruction a human does not even know how to distinguish one sex from the other, and absolutely nothing about how to love the other sex. And not even young boys and girls know these things without instruction, although trained in various fields. In a word, man is born just a body, like the worms, and he stays a body unless others teach him to know, understand, and be wise.<p>After this, they demonstrated that the animals - noble as well as lowly - animals on earth, those that fly in the sky, reptiles, fish, bugs called insects - are born with all the knowledge of their life's love. They know everything nutritious for them, all the places where they can live, everything about sexual love and propagation, and all about rearing their young. They demonstrated these things by remarkable memories they recalled of things they saw, heard, and read in the natural world - as they called our world where they had lived - where there are real and not representative animals.<p>When the truth of the proposition was established in this way they turned their minds to tracking down and finding the ends and means to unwrap and figure out this mystery. Everyone said that these things must result from Divine Wisdom so that humans can be human and animals animals, and in this way the imperfection of a human's birth becomes his perfection and the perfection of an animal's birth is its imperfection. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #133 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>133. After this they took up the second subject of discussion: WHY IS MAN NOT BORN INTO THE SCIENCE OF ANY LOVE, WHEN YET BEASTS AND BIRDS, BOTH THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE, ARE BORN INTO THE SCIENCES OF ALL THEIR LOVES? First they confirmed the truth of the proposition by various considerations, as, with respect to man, that he is born into no knowledge, not even into the knowledge of conjugial love. And making inquiry, they heard from investigators that an infant cannot apply itself to the mother's breast from any connate knowledge but must be applied to it by the mother or nurse; that it knows only how to suck, and that it has acquired this from continual suction in the womb; that later, it does not know how to walk; nor how to articulate sound into any human word, nay, nor even how to express by sound the affections of its love, as do beasts; and further, that it does not know any food suitable to itself as do all beasts, but seizes upon whatever is before it, clean or unclean, and puts it into its mouth. The investigators said, that without instruction man does not know even the distinction of sex, and knows absolutely nothing of the modes of loving the sex; and that even maidens and young men, though educated in various sciences, are ignorant of these modes unless they have learned them from others. In a word, that man is born corporeal like a worm, and remains corporeal unless he learns from others how to know, to understand, and to become wise.</p><p>[2] They then confirmed the statement that beasts, noble and ignoble, such as animals of the earth, birds of the air, reptiles, fishes, grubs which are called insects, are born into all the sciences of their life's loves, thus into all that pertain to nourishment, into all that pertain to habitation, into all that pertain to love of the sex and procreation, and into all that pertain to the rearing of their young. This they confirmed by the marvels which they recalled to memory from what they had seen, heard, and read in the natural world--so they called our world in which they had formerly lived--where the beasts are not representative but real.<p>The truth of the proposition being thus established, they then directed their minds to investigate and discover the ends and causes whereby they might unfold and disclose this arcanum. They all said that such things must needs come from Divine Wisdom, to the end that man may be man and beast beast; thus that man's imperfection at birth becomes his perfection, and the beast's perfection at birth is its imperfection. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #133 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>133. Thereupon they took up the second topic for discussion, Why is man not born into the knowledge belonging to a love, when yet beasts and birds, ignoble and noble alike, are born into the knowledges belonging to their loves? First they established the truth of the proposition by various considerations, as, with respect to man, that he is born into no knowledge, not even into knowledge concerning marital love. They inquired and learned from investigators that an infant cannot from connate knowledge even apply itself to the mother's breast, but must be moved to it by mother or nurse; and that it only knows how to suck - a knowledge acquired from the continual suction in the womb. Later, it does not know how to walk; or how to form any human word with the voice, or indeed, even how to utter the affection of its love as beasts do. Furthermore, it does not know the food suited to it, as all beasts do, but seizes anything at hand, clean or unclean, and puts it into its mouth. The investigators said that apart from instruction a man does not know the distinction of sex, and nothing at all about the ways of sexual love; young women and men know them only by learning from others, educated though they may be in various sciences. In a word, man is born corporeal, like a worm; and remains corporeal unless he learns from others to know, understand and become wise.</p><p>[2] Then they confirmed the statement that beasts, both noble and ignoble, such as land animals, birds of the air, reptiles, fish, the worms called insects, are born into all the knowledges necessary to the loves of their life. For example, into knowledge about food and shelter, about sex-love and breeding, and about raising their young. They confirmed this by remarkable examples which they recollected from what they had seen, heard, and read in the natural world (so they called our world in which they had once lived), where animals are not representative but real. Having thus established the truth of the proposition, they turned their minds to investigate and discover those ends and causes through which they might unfold and disclose this arcanum. They were agreed that such things must spring from Divine Wisdom, in order that man may be man, and beast be beast, and that the imperfection of man at his birth thus becomes his perfection, and the perfection of the beast at its birth becomes its imperfection. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #133 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>133. After this they took up the second subject of consideration, Why is not man born into the knowledge of any love, when yet beasts and birds, both the noble and the ignoble, are born into the knowledges of all their loves? First they confirmed the truth of the proposition by various considerations, as, with respect to man, that he is born into no knowledge, not even into the knowledge of conjugial love. And they inquired and learned from investigators that an infant cannot of connate knowledge even apply itself to the mother's breast, but must be moved to it by the mother or the nurse; and that it only knows how to suck, and this is acquired by continual suction in the womb. And afterwards, it does not know how to walk; nor how to articulate sound into any human word, nay, nor even how to sound the affection of its love as beasts do. And further, that it does not know any food suitable for itself, as all beasts do, but seizes whatever is presented, clean or unclean, and puts it into its mouth. The investigators said that man without instruction has not even the knowledge to distinguish sex, and knows absolutely nothing of the modes of loving it; and that not even virgins and youths know them without learning from others, though educated into various sciences. In a word, that man is born corporeal, like a worm; and remains corporeal unless he learns from others to know, to understand, and to become wise.<p>Then they confirmed the statement that beasts, the noble as well as the ignoble, such as the land animals, the birds of the air, reptiles, fishes, the worms that are called insects, are born into all the knowledges of the loves of their life. For example, into all that relate to their nourishment, all that relate to their habitation, all that relate to the love of the sex and procreation, and into all relating to the rearing of their young. They confirmed this by marvelous examples which they recalled to memory from what they had seen, heard, and read in the natural world - so they called our world in which they formerly lived - where the beasts are not representative but real. When the truth of the proposition was thus established, they directed their minds to investigate and discover the ends and causes through which they might unfold and disclose this secret. And all said that these things could not but spring from Divine Wisdom, in order that man may be man, and beast be beast and that the imperfection of man at his birth thus becomes his perfection, and the perfection of the beast at its birth becomes its imperfection. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #133 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>133. Post haec Alterum objectum ventilationis assum serunt, Cur homo non nascitur in scientiam ullius amoris, cum tamen bestiae et aves, tam nobiles quam ignobiles, nascuntur in scientias omnium suorum amorum." Primum veritatem propositionis confirmabant per varia; ut de homine, quod nascatur in nullam scientiam, ne quidem in scientiam amoris conjugialis; et inquisiverunt, et a rimatoribus audiverunt, quod infans ne quidem ex connata scientia queat ad uber matris semet admovere, sed quod a matre seu nutrice admovendus sit; et quod modo sciat sugere, <sup>1</sup>et quod hoc hauserit ex continua suctione in utero; et quod postea non sciat gradiri; nec articulare sonum in aliquam vocem humanam; imo nec sonare affectionem sui amoris, sicut bestiae: et porro, quod non sciat aliquam alimoniam sibi conducibilem, sicut omnes bestiae, sed quod arripiat obvium, sive sit mundum sive immundum, et inferat in buccam: rimatores dixerunt, quod homo absque instructione, ne quidem sciat discernere sexum, et prorsus nihil de modis amandi illum; et quod hos ne quidem virgines et juvenes absque eruditione ab aliis, tametsi in varias scientias educati sunt: verbo homo nascitur corporeus sicut vermis; et manet corporeus, nisi discat scire, intelligere et sapere ex aliis.</p><p>[2] Post haec confirmabant, quod Bestiae tam nobiles quam ignobiles, ut animalia terrae, volucres coeli, reptilia, pisces, vermiculi qui vocantur insecta, nascantur in omnes scientias amorum vitae suae, ut in omnia quae nutritionis sunt, in omnia quae habitationis sunt, in omnia quae amoris sexus <sup>2</sup>et prolificationis sunt, inque omnia quae educationis foetuum suorum sunt: haec confirmabant per mirabilia, quae revocabant in memoriam ex visis, auditis, et lectis in Mundo naturali, ita vocabant Mundum nostrum, in quo prius vixerant, in quo non repraesentativae sed reales bestiae dantur. Postquam veritas propositionis ita comprobata est, intendebant mentem ad indagandum et inveniendum fines et causas, per quas hoc Arcanum evolverent et detegerent; et dixerunt omnes, quod illa non possint non ex Divina Sapientia existere, ut homo sit homo, et bestia sit bestia; et sic quod imperfectio nativitatis hominis fiat ejus perfectio, et perfectio nativitatis bestiae sit ejus imperfectio.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: fugere,<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: sexus, </p>
