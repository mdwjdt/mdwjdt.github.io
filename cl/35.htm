<h4 align="center"></h4><p>35、每个人都有自己的爱，或说不同于别人的爱。也就是说，没有哪个人的爱和别人的相同。这一点可从五官的无穷变化看出来。面容代表爱的形像。众所周知，面部表情会随着爱的情感变化多端。关乎爱的渴望，以及欢乐和痛苦的感受都表现在脸上。由此明显可知，人就是他的爱，确切地说，他是爱的形式。不过，要知道，只有内在人，也就是他死后活着的灵，才是爱的形式。尘世中的外在人并不是，因为外在人从小就学习隐藏自己的爱欲；事实上，他学习伪装并表现出其它欲望，而非自己真正的欲望。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #35 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>35. The infinite variety of people's faces is an indication that everyone has his own love, to be distinguished from anyone else's, that is to say, no one has the same love as another. Faces are the expression of loves, for it is well known that faces change and look different, depending on the affections of a person's love. Desires too which are part of love, as well as its joys and sorrows, shine out from the face. This shows plainly that a person is his own love, or rather a form taken by his love. But it ought to be known that the inner man, which is one and the same as his spirit which lives on after death, is a form taken by his love. But the outer man in the world is not, because this has learned from childhood up to hide the desires of his love, or rather to pretend and make a show of something other than his true feelings. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #35 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>35. Everyone has his own love, or a love different from anyone else's love. That is, no one person has the same love as another. This can be seen from the endless variety in facial features. Faces are the representative images of loves. Everyone knows that facial expressions change and vary according to the affections of love. Desires also, which have to do with love, as well as feelings of joy and pain, shine forth from the face.<p>From this it is evident that a person is what he loves, or rather, that he is the form of his love. But it should be known that it is the inner person - which is the same as his spirit that lives after death - that is the form of his love. Not so the outer person in the world, because the outer person has learned from early childhood to hide the desires of his love, indeed, to pretend and feign other desires than his true ones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #35 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>35. Everyone has his own love, or a love distinct from anyone else's. That is, no one has the same love as anyone else. You can tell this from the infinite variety of faces, which are images of loves - for we know that faces change and differ according to feelings of love. Desires, too, which belong to love, besides its joys and sorrows, shine out from the face. This makes it clear that a person is his love - in fact he is the living image of his love. But note that it is the inner person, which is the same as the person's spirit that lives after death, that is the image of his love, and not the outer person in the world, because the outer person has learned from infancy to hide the desires of his love - indeed to simulate and display different ones than its own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #35 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>35. That every one has his own love, or a love distinct from another's love, that is, that the love of one man is not the same as that of another, is evident from the infinite variety of faces. Faces are the types of loves; for it is well known that countenances change and vary according to the affections of the love. Moreover, desires, which are desires of the love, and also the love's joys and sorrows, shine forth from the face. It is clear from this that a man is his love, yea, the form of his love. But it should be known that the form of man's love is the inner man, being the same as his spirit which lives after death, and not in the same way the outer man [which lives] in the world; for the latter has learned from infancy to conceal the desires of his love, yea, to simulate and make a show of desires other than his own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #35 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>35. The infinite variety of human faces attests that every man has his own life-love, or one distinct from and not like another's. Faces are types of love; we know how faces change and vary according to the love's affections. From the face shine the moods of love, too, both its joys and its griefs. It is evident then that a human being is a love which is his own, indeed is the form of that love. But this, it should be noted, is true of the inward man, or the spirit, which survives death, and not of the outward man who from infancy has learned to conceal his love's desires, and indeed to feign and present others than his own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #35 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>35. That everyone has his own love, or a love distinct from another's love, that is, that the love of one man is not the same as that of another, is evident from the infinite variety of faces. Faces are the types of loves. For it is known that countenances change and vary according to the affections of love. Desires also, which are of love, and its joys and sorrows, shine forth from the face. It is clear from this that a man is his own love, yea, is the form of his love. But it should be known that the form of his love is the interior man, which is the same as his spirit that lives after death; and not also his outward man in the world, because this has learned from infancy to conceal the desires of his love, yea, to pretend to and put forward other desires than his own. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #35 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>35. Quod suus amor cuivis sit, seu distinctus ab amore alterius, hoc est, quod non similis amor sit uni homini, qui est alteri, constare potest ex infinita varietate facierum, facies sunt typi amorum; nam quod mutentur ac varientur facies secundum affectiones amoris, notum est; desideria etiam, quae sunt amoris, tum gaudia et dolores ejus, elucent inde: ex hoc patet, quod homo sit suus Amor, imo sui Amoris forma. At sciendum est, quod interior homo, qui idem est cum spiritu ejus, qui vivit post mortem, sit forma sui amoris; non similiter exterior homo in Mundo, quia hic ab infantia didicit occultare sui amoris desideria, imo simulare ac praeferre alia quam sua. </p>
