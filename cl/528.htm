<h4 align="center"></h4><p>528、对此，我补充以下内容：在教会有这样一种说法：没有人能守全律法，人甚至不能遵行，因为凡违反十诫中的一条者就违反了全部。然而，这种说法和它听上去的并不一样。这句话必须这样来理解：凡有意或确认违反一条诫命者就违反了其余的，因为有意或经确认行事就是完全否认这种行为是一种罪，凡否认它是罪的人也不在乎违反其它诫命。谁不知道，人若是一个奸淫者，不会因此就成了一个杀人犯、小偷或作假见证的人，也不想成为这种人？但是，凡有意或经确认成为奸淫者的人，会视一切宗教忌讳，因而视杀人、偷盗和作假见证为无足轻重。他之所以克制这些行为，非因它们是罪，乃因他害怕法律和丧失名声。有意和确定的奸淫者视教会和宗教的禁令为一文不值（参看490-493节，500，521，522节中的两个记事）。若人有意或经确认违反任何其它诫命，情形也一样；他违反了其余的，因为他不认为它们当中的任意一条是一种罪。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>528、在此我要补充以下内容，在教会中有人说没有人完全守法，那些违反十诫之一的也就违反了其余的诫律。但这并非象所说的那样。因为那些有目的的，故意地违反十诫的人在违反其中的一条时也就是违反了其余的。因为这样的行为是否认其罪恶。否认罪恶存在的人则会认为违反十诫的诫律也是没什么的。</p><p>我们知道通奸者是不一定同时也是谋杀者，贼、作伪证者等等，但是一个有目的的，故意的通奸者——他会认为一切与宗教相关的东西都无所谓，所以谋杀、偷盗、作伪证等也是无所谓。若这些人不做以上恶行，他们并不是因为那是罪恶的，而是因为他们害怕法律的惩罚或名誉的丧失。</p><p>这可以从490-493以及500、521、522节中看到。故意犯淫罪的人认为教会神圣诫律是无所谓的。同样那些故意违反十诫其余诫律的也就违反了所有诫律。因为他们不认为任何行为是罪恶的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #528 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>528. To this I shall add the following. There is a saying in the church that no one can fulfil the law, and he is even less able to do so because anyone who offends against one of the Ten Commandments, offends against them all. However, this manner of speaking is not what it sounds like. For it should be understood to mean that anyone acting of set purpose or by assent contrary to one commandment is acting against the rest, because acting of set purpose or by assent is to deny utterly that it is a sin, and anyone who denies that it is a sin treats acting contrary to the rest as a matter of no consequence.<p>Everyone knows that, if a man is an adulterer, he is not therefore a murderer, thief or false witness, nor does he want to be. But anyone who is of set purpose and by assent an adulterer treats as of no consequence every religious scruple, and so equally murder, theft and bearing false witness; and he does not refrain from these actions because they are sins, but because he is afraid of the law and of losing his reputation. Adulterers of set purpose and by assent pay no heed to the injunctions of the church and religion; see above <a href="490.htm">490-493</a>, and in the two accounts of experiences, <a href="500.htm">500</a>, <a href="521.htm">521-522</a>. It is much the same, if anyone of set purpose or by assent acts contrary to any other Commandment; he acts contrary to all the rest, because he does not consider any of them to be a sin. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #528 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>528. To this I will add the following. It is said in the church that no one can fulfill the law, and the less so since anyone who sins against one commandment of the Decalogue sins against them all. But this conventional maxim is not as it sounds; for it is to be understood in this way, that anyone who purposefully or deliberately acts against one commandment acts against the rest, since to act purposefully or deliberately is to deny altogether that the action is a sin, and anyone who denies the existence of sin regards it as nothing if he acts against the rest of the commandments.<p>Who does not know that one who is an adulterer is not on that account a murderer, thief, and false witness, nor wills to be? But one who is a purposeful and deliberate adulterer - such a one regards everything having to do with religion as nothing, including therefore murder, theft, and false witness; and if he refrains from them, he does not do so because they are sins, but because he fears the law and damage to his reputation.<p>It may be see above, nos. <a href="490.htm">490-493</a>, and in two narrative accounts, nos. <a href="500.htm">500</a> and <a href="521.htm">521</a>, <a href="522.htm">522</a>, that purposeful and deliberate adulterers account the sacred tenets of the church and religion as nothing. The case is the same if anyone acts purposefully or deliberately against any other commandment of the Decalogue, namely, that he acts also against the rest, because he does not regard anything as a sin. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #528 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>528. This is added: In the church they say that no one can fulfill the law - all the less because someone who breaks one commandment of the Decalogue breaks them all. But this catch phrase is not what it sounds like, because, you see, someone who acts against one commandment on purpose and in confirmation acts against the others, since to act on purpose and in confirmation is to fully deny that it is a sin, and whoever denies that it is a sin thinks nothing of it if he acts against the other commandments. Who does not know that being an adulterer does not make a person a murderer, a thief, and a false witness - or want to be. But someone who is a confirmed adulterer on purpose makes nothing of anything related to religion, thus not murder, not theft, not false witness, and he keeps from doing them not because they are sins but because he is afraid of the law and fears for his reputation.<p>(Nos. 490-93, above, and the two stories, nos. 500 and 521-22, show that confirmed adulterers who commit adultery on purpose count the holy things of the church and religion as nothing.) It is the same if someone acts against one of the other commandments of the Decalogue on purpose or in confirmation. He acts against the rest as well, because he does not consider anything a sin. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #528 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>528. To the above is added the following: It is said in the church that no one can fulfil the law, and the less so since he who transgresses against one commandment of the Decalogue, transgresses against all. But this formula of speech is not as it sounds. It must be understood in this way: He who from purpose or confirmation acts against one commandment acts against the rest; for to act thus from purpose or confirmation is wholly to deny that the action is a sin, and he who denies sin makes nothing of acting against the other commandments. Who does not know that one who is an adulterer is not therefore a murderer, a thief, and a false witness, and does not wish to be? But one who is an adulterer from purpose and confirmation makes all things of religion to be of no account, and so makes nothing of murder, theft, and false witness, and abstains from them, not because they are sins but because he fears the law and the loss of his reputation. That adulterers from purpose and confirmation account the sacred things of the church and of religion as of no value may be seen above (nos. <a href="490.htm">490-493</a>) and in the two Relations, nos. <a href="500.htm">500</a>,<a href="521.htm">521, 522</a>. It is the same if from purpose or confirmation one acts against any other commandment of the Decalogue; because, not reputing anything as a sin, he acts also against the rest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #528 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>528. The following <sup >1</sup>shall be added. There is a saying in the Church that no one can fulfil the law, and the less so for the reason that if a man transgresses one commandment of the Decalogue, he transgresses all. But this form of speech is not what it sounds to be. For it is to be understood thus, that one who acts against one commandment from purpose or by confirmation acts against the rest, for to act from purpose or by confirmation is to deny absolutely that it is sin, and one who denies sin makes nothing of acting against the rest of the commandments. Who does not know that a man who is an adulterer is not for that reason a murderer, thief and false witness, nor wills to be? But one who is an adulterer of purpose and by confirmation makes nothing of all things of religion, and thus nothing of murder, theft and false witness, and abstains from them, not because they are sins, but because he fears the law and the loss of reputation. See above (nn. <a href="490.htm">490-493</a>, and in the two Memorabilia, nn. <a href="500.htm">500</a>, <a href="521.htm">521-522</a>) that adulterers of purpose and by confirmation think nothing of the holy things of the Church and of religion. The like applies if one acts of purpose and by confirmation against any other commandment of the Decalogue; he also acts against the rest, not considering anything to be sin.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Also found in Brief Exposition,<a href="113.htm">113</a>, and see <a href="../tcr/523.htm">True Christian Religion 523</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #528 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>528. To this is added the following. It is said in the church that no one can fulfil the law, and the less so for the reason that if a man offends against one commandment of the Decalogue, he offends against all. But this form of speech is not as it sounds. For it must be thus understood, that he who of purpose or from confirmation acts against one commandment acts against the rest, because to act thus from purpose or from confirmation is to deny altogether that it is a sin, and he who denies it to be a sin makes nothing of acting against the other commandments. Who does not know that one who is an adulterer is not therefore, a murderer, a thief, and a false witness, and does not wish to be? But a man who from purpose and from confirmation is an adulterer makes nothing of anything pertaining to religion, and so makes nothing of murder, of theft, and of false witness, and abstains from them, not because they are sins, but because he has fear of the law and of his reputation. That adulterers from purpose and from confirmation regard the sacred things of the church and of religion of no account may be seen above, n. <a href="490.htm">490-493</a>, and in the two Relations, n. <a href="500.htm">500</a>, <a href="521.htm">521</a>, <a href="522.htm">522</a>. It is similar if one from purpose or from confirmation acts against any other commandment of the Decalogue, he acts also against the rest, because he does not regard anything as a sin. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #528 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>528. His adjicietur hoc; dicitur in Ecclesia, quod nemo possit implere legem, et eo minus, quoniam qui praevaricatur contra unum praeceptum Decalogi, praevaricatur contra omnia; verum haec loquutionis formula non est qualis sonat; nam hoc ita intelligendum est, quod qui ex proposito aut confirmato agit contra unum praeceptum, ille agat contra reliqua, quoniam ex proposito aut ex confirmato agere, est prorsus negare quod peccatum sit, et qui negat peccatum, ille nihili facit si contra praecepta reliqua agit: quis non scit, quod qui adulter est, non ideo sit homicida, fur, et falsus testis, nec velit esse; at qui adulter ex proposito et confirmato est, hic nihili facit omnia quae religionis, ita nec homicidia, furta et falsa testimonia, et quod ab his non abstineat quia peccata sunt, sed quia timet legem et famam: quod adulteri ex proposito et ex confirmato nihili pendant sancta Ecclesiae et religionis, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_528/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_490" target=_top>490-493</a>, et in binis Memorabilibus <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_528/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_500" target=_top>500</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_528/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_521" target=_top>521-522</a>; <sup>1</sup>simile est, si quis ex proposito aut confirmato contra unum aliud praeceptum Decalogi agit, quod etiam contra reliqua agat, quia non aliquid reputat peccatum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: 522. </p>
