<h4 align="center"></h4><p>356、说完这番话，这位天使沉默了。新来的灵人从他谈话的主旨中领悟到，得享快乐的永恒能力是可能的。这令他们心花怒放，不停地说：“哦，天使的状态何等幸福！我们发觉，在天上，你们永远保持在青年状态，因而保持在那个年龄的性能力中；但请告诉我们，我们如何也能获得那种性能力。”“避淫行如地狱，”天使回答说，“靠近主；你们就会拥有它。”“我们会照你说的避开它们，”他们说，“我们会靠近主。”不过，天使回答说：“你们无法避淫行如地狱的邪恶，除非你们同样避开其它一切邪恶，因为奸淫集所有邪恶为一体。你们若不避开它们，就无法靠近主。主不接受这类人。”言毕，天使离开了，新灵垂头丧气地走了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #356 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>356. After saying this the angel fell silent, and the newcomers grasped from the gist of his talk that a perpetual capacity for delight is possible. Since this made their disposition cheerful, they kept saying, 'O how happy is the state of angels! We perceive that you in the heavens remain for ever at the stage of becoming adult, and so you have the potency of that age. But tell us how we too may acquire that potency.' 'Shun acts of adultery as hellish,' the angel replied, 'and approach the Lord; then you will have it.'<p>'We shall shun them as you say,' they said, 'and we shall approach the Lord.' But the angel answered, 'You cannot shun acts of adultery as hellish evils, unless you likewise shun all other evils, since adultery gathers them all into one. And unless you shun them, you cannot approach the Lord. The Lord does not accept such people.' After this the angel left, and the new spirits went away dejected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #356 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>356. Having said that, the angel fell silent; and the newcomers realized from the spirit of the angel's discourse that a continual ability to experience delight was possible. Then because this gladdened their hearts, they began to say, "Oh, how happy is the state of angels! We perceive that you in heaven remain to eternity in a state of youth and enjoy therefore the virility of that age. But tell us how we may also attain that virility."<p>So the angel answered, "Refrain from adulterous affairs as hellish and go to the Lord, and you will have it."<p>And they said, "We will refrain from them as such and go to the Lord."<p>But the angel replied, "You cannot refrain from adulterous affairs as being evil and hellish unless you refrain from other evils likewise, because adultery embraces them all; and unless you refrain from them you cannot go to the Lord. The Lord does not receive people otherwise."<p>After that the angel departed, and those new spirits went away despondent. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #356 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>356. When he had said this, the angel was silent, and the new arrivals understood from the spirit of his speech that a constant ability to enjoy is possible. This gladdened their souls, so they said, "Oh, what a happy state the angels have! We can tell that you in heaven always stay in youthful condition and therefore in the vigor of youth. But tell us how we can get that vigor, too!"<p>The angel answered, "A void adulteries as hellish things, and go to the Lord, and you'll have that vigor."<p>They said, "We'll avoid them like that, and we'll go to the Lord."<p>But the angel answered, "You can't avoid adulteries as hellish evils unless you avoid the other evils the same way, because adulteries are all the evils wrapped together. And you can't go to the Lord unless you avoid them. The Lord doesn't accept them."<p>After this the angel left, and the new spirits went away disappointed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #356 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>356. After saying this, the angel was silent. From the spirit of his speech the newly arrived novitiates comprehended that a perpetual ability to enjoy the delights is possible. This so gladdened their minds that they exclaimed: "Oh, how happy is the state of angels! We perceive that you in heaven remain to eternity in the state of youth and hence in the vigor of that age; but tell us how we also may acquire that vigor;" and the angel responded, "Shun adulteries as infernal, and approach the Lord, and you will have it."<p>The novitiates then said, "We will shun them as such and will approach the Lord;" but the angel answered: "You cannot shun adulteries as infernal evils unless you shun all other evils likewise, for adulteries are the complex of them all, and unless you shun them you cannot approach the Lord. Others than these, the Lord does not receive."<p>The angel then departed, and the new spirits went away sorrowful. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #356 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>356. Thereupon the angel ceased speaking. The newcomers understood from the spirit of his speech that there can be a perpetual faculty of enjoyment. This gladdened their minds, and they exclaimed, "How happy the state of angels is! We perceive that you in heaven remain to eternity in the state of youth and hence in the vigor of that age. But tell us how may we also attain that vigor."<p>The angel answered, "Shun adulteries as infernal and come to the Lord, and you will have it."<p>They replied, "We will shun them as infernal and come to the Lord."<p>But the angel answered, "Unless you shun all other evils likewise, you cannot shun adulteries as infernal evils, for adulteries are the complex of them all; unless you shun them, you cannot come to the Lord. The Lord receives no others."<p>Thereupon the angel departed and the new spirits went away sorrowful. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #356 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>356. Saying this the angel ceased; and the new-comers comprehended from the spirit of his speech that there can be a perpetual faculty of enjoyment, and as this gladdened their minds, they exclaimed, 'O, how happy the state of the angels. We perceive that you in heaven remain to eternity in the state of youth, and hence in the vigor of that age. But tell us how may we also attain that vigor?'<p>And the angel responded, 'Shun adulteries as infernal and come to the Lord, and you will have it.'<p>And they replied, 'We will thus shun them and come to the Lord.'<p>But the angel answered, 'You cannot shun adulteries as infernal evils unless you shun all other evils likewise, for adulteries are the complex of them all; unless you shun them you cannot come to the Lord. Others than such the Lord does not receive.'<p>After this the angel departed, and the new spirits went away sorrowful. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #356 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>356. His dictis tacuit Angelus, et Novitii advenae ex spiritu loquelae Angeli comprehendebant, quod perpetua facultas delitiandi dabilis sit; et quia id laetificabat animos illorum, dicebant, "oh quam felix status est Angelorum; percipimus quod vos in Coelis in aeternum permaneatis in statu adolescentiae, et inde in virtute aetatis illius; sed dic nobis quomodo nos illa virtute etiam potituri simus;" et respondit Angelus, "fugite Adulteria ut infernalia, et adite Dominum, et habebitis;" et dixerunt, "fugiemus illa ita, et adibimus Dominum;" sed respondit Angelus, "non potestis fugere adulteria ut mala infernalia, nisi fugeritis reliqua mala similiter, quia adulteria sunt complexus omnium, et nisi illa fugeritis, non potestis adire Dominum; Dominus non recipit illos." Post haec secessit Angelus, ac novi illi spiritus abiverunt tristes. </p>
