<h4 align="center"></h4><p>421、“对此，有必要补充的是：我在灵界看见那些利用世上的可见事物确认赞成自然界的人最终沦为无神论者。以属灵之光观之，他们的理解力向下打开，向上关闭，因为他们的思维向下注视大地，而不是向上仰望天堂。他们的感官觉知功能，也就是理解力的最低级部分，可以说上面蒙上了一层面纱。这面纱有时闪烁着地狱之火，有时黑如煤烟，有时白如死尸。所以，人人都要当心，不要确认赞成自然界，而要确认赞成神性；这并不缺乏证明材料。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #421 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>421. 'To this it must be added that in the spiritual world I have seen those who used such observations in the world to convince themselves in favour of nature reduced to the point of becoming atheists. Their intellect was to be seen in spiritual light open underneath, but closed above, because their thoughts are directed downwards to the earth, and not up to the sky. Above their faculty of sense-perception, which is the lowest part of the intellect, was to be seen a kind of covering. In some cases this flashed with hellish fire, in others it was black as soot, in others still livid like a corpse. So let everyone beware of proofs in favour of nature, and seek proofs in favour of the Divine. There is no lack of material on which to draw. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #421 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>421. To this I should add the following, that in the spiritual world I have seen people who, from the visible phenomena of the world, confirmed themselves on the side of nature to the point that they became atheists, and in a spiritual light their intellect appeared open below but closed above, for the reason that in thought they had looked downward to the earth, and not upward to heaven. Above the sensory level, which is the lowest level of the intellect, a kind of veil appeared, in some cases flashing with a hellish fire, in some cases as black as soot, and in some cases as pale as a corpse.<p>Let everyone guard himself, therefore, from confirmations on the side of nature. Let him confirm himself on the side of the Divine. There is no lack of material for it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #421 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>421. "I should add to these remarks that people who have confirmed themselves in favor of nature by things seen in the world, to the point of becoming atheists, have been seen in the spiritual world, and in spiritual light their intellect appeared open below but closed above, because in thought they look down to the earth and not up toward heaven. There seemed to be something like a curtain over their sensory level - the lowest level of the intellect.<p>In some it was lit with infernal fire, in some it was black like soot, and in some livid like a corpse. So beware of confirmations in favor of nature, everyone. Confirm yourself in favor of Divinity.<p>There is no lack of material." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #421 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>421. "To this it should be added that men who from things visible in the world, have so confirmed themselves in favor of nature that they became atheists, have been seen by me in the spiritual world. Seen in spiritual light, their understanding was open below but closed above, and this because in their thought they had looked downwards to the earth and not upwards to heaven. Above their sensual, Which is the lowest part of the understanding, appeared, as it were, a veil. With some it was flashing from infernal fire, with others it was black as soot, and with still others, livid as a corpse. Let every one, therefore, beware of confirmations in favor of nature. Let him confirm himself in favor of the Divine; there is no lack of material. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #421 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>421. "To this I should add that I have seen those in the spiritual world who have so confirmed themselves in favor of nature from visible things in the world that they have become atheists. In spiritual light their understanding appeared open beneath but closed above, because in thought they look down to the earth, and not up to heaven. Above their sensuous mind, which is the lowest reach of the understanding, appeared a veil as it were, in some flashing with infernal fire, in others black as with soot, and in still others livid like a corpse. Let every one, then, be on his guard against confirmations in favor of nature; let him confirm himself in favor of the Divine. There is no lack of means." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #421 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>421. 'To this should be added, that there have been seen in the spiritual world those who have so confirmed themselves in favor of nature, from the visible things of the world, that they have become atheists; and that in spiritual light their understanding appeared open beneath but closed above, because in thought they look downwards to the earth, and not upwards towards heaven; above their sensual, which is the lowest of the understanding, appeared a veil as it were, with some flashing from infernal fire, with some black as from soot, and with some livid as a corpse. Let everyone then be on his guard against confirmations in favor of nature; let him confirm himself in favor of the Divine. There is no lack of material.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #421 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>421. "His adjiciendum est, quod in Mundo spirituali visi sint illi, qui pro natura ex visibilibus Mundi se confirmaverunt, usque ut athei facti sint, et quod intellectus eorum in luce spirituali apparuerit apertus infra, sed clausus supra, ex causa, quia cogitatione spectarunt deorsum ad terram, et non sursum ad Coelum: supra sensuale, quod est infimum intellectus, apparuit sicut velamen, apud quosdam fulgurans ex igne infernali, apud quosdam atrum sicut fuliginis, et apud quosdam lividum sicut cadaveris. Caveat itaque quisque sibi a confirmationibus pro natura; confirmet se pro Divino; non deest supellex. </p>
