Post hoc, ducti sunt ad quendam Consiliarium a latere, et coenaverunt cum illo, et post coenam redierunt, et secesserunt ab invicem, quisque in suum cubiculum, et dormiverunt usque ad mane; et tunc evigilati audiebant Cantum virginum et puellarum <sup>1</sup>e domibus circum Forum, de quo supra; canebatur tunc affectio amoris conjugialis; ex cujus suavitate penitus affecti et perciti, percipiebant beatam amaenitatem insitam gaudiis suis, quae elevabat illa, et innovabat illa. Cum tempus erat, dixit Angelus, "accingite vos, et induite vestes Coeli, quas Princeps noster ad vos miserat;" ac induerunt, et ecce vestes splendebant sicut ex luce flammea; et quaesiverunt Angelum, "unde hoc;" respondit, "quia ad nuptias ituri estis; apud nos tunc splendent vestes, et fiunt nuptiales."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: puellatum </p>
