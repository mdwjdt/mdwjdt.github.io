<h4 align="center"></h4><p>5、这个天使边说边带路，相信天上的喜乐只是风趣的聚会和愉快交谈的这一组先跟随其后。他们在天使的带领下，加入到北部地区的集会，此处的人在世时对天上喜乐的概念正是这样。这群人现聚集在一个宽敞的大厅里，厅内有五十多个房间，不同房间的人谈论不同话题。有的在房间内谈论广场或街道的所见所闻；有的谈论关于女性的各种暧昧话题，还穿插一些笑话，以引得在场的人捧腹大笑。在其它房间，有的讨论从各种秘密渠道走漏的消息，涉及王室宫庭、政府部门、政治局势，以及对结果的推断和猜测；有的谈论生意；有的谈论文学；有的谈论公共事务和道德行为；有的则讨论教会事务和宗教门派，凡此种种，不一而足。我蒙允许观察厅内情形，看到人们从一个房间跑到另一个房间，寻找回应他们情感、因而回应他们关于喜乐概念的聚会。在这些聚会中，我发现了三种人：有的说起话来几乎喘不过气来，有的急于问问题，有的则热衷侧耳旁听。<br><br>这个大厅有四道门，各对着四个方位。我注意到许多人离开聚会，急急忙忙地出去。我跟随他们来到东门，发现其中一些人正拉长脸坐在门边。于是，我走到他们面前，问他们为何如此忧愁地坐在这里。他们回答说：“大厅的门一直关闭，以防想要离开的人出去。我们已经进来三天了，时间全花在我们原先想要的聚会和交谈上。我们厌倦了喋喋不休说个没完，再也不想听到它的噪音。由于烦得要命，所以就来到这门前敲门，却被告知，这里的门只许进，不许出，我们必须留在此处享受天上的喜乐。听到这个答复，我们断定自己将永远困在这里，所以心里悲愁，现在感到胸口发闷，越来越焦虑。”<br><br>这时，天使对他们说：“就你们的快乐而言，这种状态就是死亡。你们原以为它们是天上唯一的喜乐，而事实上，它们只不过是天上喜乐的附属物。”他们问天使：“那么，什么是天上的喜乐？”天使简要回答说：“做有益自己或他人之事就是天上的快乐。这种快乐从爱得其本质，从智慧得其显现。服务的快乐由爱藉着智慧产生，是一切天上喜乐的灵魂和生命。<br><br>“天上有最快乐的聚会，它们愉悦天使的心灵，使他们的灵快乐，令他们开心，使身体重新焕发活力。但是，他们只有完成自己的工作职责之后才会享受这些。赋予灵魂和生命一切乐趣和欢娱的根本在于提供服务。若你将这灵魂或生命拿走，附属的快乐就会一个个销声匿迹，先是模糊，然后变得毫无价值，最后成了悲伤烦恼的源头。”天使说完这话，门开了，坐在门边的那些人一跃而起，匆忙回家，回到各自的工作岗位，重获生机。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>5、（1）说着，天使带路，带领那些认为天国之乐就是愉悦地相处，快乐地交谈的人。天使将他们带入北部区域中，在那里是在世间有着与他们相同观点的人。在那儿有座大房子，这样的人集合在那里。这座房子有五十多个房间，每个房间都有不同的话题。</p><p>一些房中的人在谈论他们在街上听到事情。一些房间中的人在谈论性，诙谐地交流直到每个人都露出笑容。一些房间中的人在谈论与皇家相关的事情，职务，政治立场，谈论秘密事件并猜测结果。一些房间在谈论商务，一些在谈学术。一些在谈论公共事务及道德。一些在谈论教会及宗教派系等等。</p><p>我被允许观看每个房间。我看到人们从一房间跑到另一个房间，寻找与自己相同的人，这样的人与他们的喜好相和谐。在人群中，我看到三种人：一些急着在讲话，一些急着问问题，一些渴望地听着。</p><p>（2）这座房子有四扇门，每扇门面向一个方向，我注意到许多人都在离开聚会，忙着离开。跟随其中的几个人来到东门，我看到他们中的许多人坐在旁边，低着头。我走过去问他们为什么这样不高兴地坐在这里。</p><p>他们回答说：“这些门将要离开的人关在里面。现在已经是我们到这儿的第三天了，过着我们渴望的与人交流的生活，我们已经厌倦了这种不停的谈话，以致于无法忍受里面传来的低声谈话，所以疲倦不堪的我们走到这扇门并敲了门。但我们得到的答复是这房子的门对要离开的人是关闭的，只向想进来的人所敞开。‘留下来，享受天堂的快乐！’我们被告知。由此我们推断我们将被困在这直到永远。现在我们充满抑郁，我们心中感到压抑、焦虑。”</p><p>（3）这时天使对他们说：“这是你们的快乐消亡的阶段，那种你们所相信的天堂唯一的快乐，你们所理解的天堂之乐只是天堂之乐的次要组成部分。”</p><p>于是他们问天使：“那么什么是天堂之乐？”</p><p>天使简要地答道：“是从做对自己和别人有益的事中得到的快乐，对人对己有意义的快乐来自于爱和智慧。有意义经过智慧而来自于爱，是天国之乐和精髓。</p><p>（4）“天国中的天使喜欢快乐的交往，它能激励他们的思想，使他们身心愉悦。但他们只能在工作中尽职尽责之后才能享受到这种快乐交往。他们愉悦快乐的实质来自于他们所尽的有意义的各种职责。如果将这种实质拿走，次要的快乐就会渐渐地消逝，先是淡漠，然后是愚蠢，最后变成沉寂令人沮丧。</p><p>说着，门开了，那里的人跳出来，逃回家中，回到自己的岗位，他们重新获得了生机。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #5 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>5. With these words the angel led the way, and was first accompanied by the group which had persuaded itself that heavenly joys were only most entertaining meetings and charming conversations. These people were taken by the angel to join gatherings in the northern quarter, whose ideas of the joys of heaven had been in the previous world precisely this. There was a spacious building in which people of this sort were gathered; it contained more than fifty rooms, different ones being allocated to each of the various topics of conversation. In one set of rooms the talk was of what they had seen or heard in the square or the streets; in another there was charming talk of different kinds about the fair sex, with enough jokes included to make everyone present burst out into hilarious laughter. In other rooms they were discussing the news about royal courts, government departments, the political situation, leaks from various secret committees, together with deductions and guesses about the outcome. Other rooms were devoted to trade, others to literary subjects, others to matters concerned with public affairs and moral behaviour, others to ecclesiastical matters and different sects, and so on.<p>I was allowed to look inside that building, and I saw people running from one room to another, looking for gatherings which answered to their affection and thus to their idea of joy. In the gatherings I saw three sorts of people: some who were more or less panting to speak, some who were anxious to ask questions, and some keen on listening.</p><p>[2] The building had four doors, one on each side, and I noticed that many people were breaking up the gatherings and hastening to leave. I followed some of them to the east door, and saw some people sitting near it with long faces. So I went up to them and asked why they were sitting looking so sad. 'The doors of this building,' they replied, 'are kept shut against those who want to leave. It is now three days since we came in, and we have spent our time as we wished in meetings and conversations, and we have become so tired of continual talk that we can hardly bear to listen to the mere noise of it. We were so bored we made our way to this door and knocked; but we were told that the doors of this building are open for people to come in, but not to go out. "Stay and enjoy the joys of heaven," they told us. So we concluded from this reply that we shall have to stay here for ever. As a result our minds have fallen victim to sadness, our chests are beginning now to feel constricted, and we are becoming worried.'</p><p>[3] Then the angel addressed them and said: 'This state is death to your joys, the ones you thought were the only heavenly ones, though they are but concomitant to heavenly joys.' 'What then,' they asked the angel, 'is heavenly joy?'<p>The angel replied briefly as follows: 'It is the pleasure of doing something which is of service to oneself or others. This pleasure derives its essence from love, and its coming-into-being from wisdom. The pleasure of service arising from love by means of wisdom is the soul and life of all heavenly joys.</p><p>[4] There are in the heavens most entertaining meetings, which cheer the angels' minds, delight their spirits, gladden their hearts and refresh their bodies. But these take place after they have performed services in their occupations and work. This is what gives soul and life to all their pleasures and amusements. But if you deprive them of that soul or life, the concomitant joys one after another cease to be joys, first becoming matters of indifference, and then worthless, and finally the source of sadness and worry.'<p>When he had said this, the door was opened and the people sitting near leaped out. They hurried away home, each to his own occupation and his own work, and so were revived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #5 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>5. So saying, the angel led the way, accompanied first by the company of those who had persuaded themselves that heavenly joys consisted simply in delightful associations and enjoyable conversations. The angel introduced them to gatherings in the northern zone, comprised of people who in the former world had had the same idea of the joys of heaven. There was a huge house there, into which people like this were brought together. The house had more than fifty rooms, each devoted to a different topic of conversation.<p>In some of the rooms they were talking about things they had seen or heard in the public square and in the streets. In others they were saying various amiable things about the fair sex, interspersed with witty exchanges that kept increasing until the faces of all in the gathering expanded into merry laughter. In other rooms they were discussing news relating to the royal courts, their ministries, the political condition, and various matters emanating from the privy councils, with arguments and conjectures regarding the outcomes. In other rooms the subject was business. In others, scholarly matters. In others, concerns having to do with citizenship and moral living. In others, affairs having to do with the church and religious denominations. And so on.<p>It was granted me to look into the house, and I saw people running from room to room, looking for gatherings with their same affection and so in harmony with their joy. In the gatherings I also saw three kinds of people: some practically panting to speak, some anxious to ask questions, and some eager to listen.</p><p>[2] The house had four doors, one toward each of the four points of the compass, and I noticed that many were leaving their gatherings and hurrying to get out. Following several of these to the east door, I saw a number of them sitting beside it with downcast faces. I went over to them and asked why they were sitting there so sadly.<p>They answered, "The doors of this house are kept closed to anyone trying to leave. It is now the third day since we arrived, and having lived the life we longed for in socializing and conversation, we have grown tired of the constant talk, to the point that we can hardly bear to hear the murmur of sounds coming from it. So, out of weariness and boredom we made our way to this door and knocked. But we received the reply that the doors of this house are not opened for people wishing to leave, only for those wanting to enter. 'Stay and enjoy the joys of heaven!' we were told. From this response we concluded that we are to remain here to eternity. Our minds were filled with dejection at this, and now we are becoming oppressed at heart and taken with anxiety."</p><p>[3] The angel then spoke to them and said, "This state is the state in which your joys die, joys you believed to be the only heavenly joys, when in fact they are merely subsidiary adjuncts to heavenly joys."<p>So they asked the angel, "What, then, is heavenly joy?"<p>The angel answered, briefly, "It is the pleasure of doing something that is of use to oneself and to others, and the pleasure in being useful takes its essence from love and its expression from wisdom. The pleasure in being useful, springing from love through wisdom, is the life and soul of all heavenly joys.</p><p>[4] "Angels in heaven enjoy delightful associations which stimulate their minds, gladden their spirits, gratify their hearts, and recreate their bodies. But they enjoy these associations after they have performed useful services in their occupations and employments. The life and soul in all their delights and pleasures comes from the useful services they perform. If you take away that life or soul, however, the subsidiary joys gradually become no longer joys, but first matters of indifference, then stupid, and finally dreary and distressing."<p>With these words the door was opened, and the people sitting there leapt up and fled away home, each one to his occupation and employment, and so they were revitalized. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #5 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>5. After he said this the angel went ahead, accompanied first by the group persuaded that heavenly joys just consist of pleasant company and most agreeable conversations. The angel led them to crowds in the northern parts who in the former world had the same idea of heavenly joys. There was a spacious house there, where they were gathered. There were more than fifty rooms in the house, specified for different kinds of conversation. In one room they talked about things they saw and heard in public places and in the streets, in another they were telling various stories about the fair sex, throwing in more and more witticisms, until the faces of all the crowd were spread with cheerful laughter.<p>In other rooms they told news about the court, about the ministries, state policy, various things that had leaked out of secret councils, and they reasoned about the events and made conjectures.<p>In others they talked about business. In others literary subjects. In others about things having to do with civic prudence and the moral life. In others about churches and sects. And so on.<p>I was able to investigate this house, and I saw them wandering from room to room looking for others who shared their interests and therefore their joys. And among the clusters I noticed three types - some catching their breath to speak, some eager to find out something, and some listening insatiably.<p>The house had four doors, one for each direction. I noticed that many detached themselves from the company, in a hurry to go. I followed some of them to the east door and saw several sitting by it with sad faces. I approached and asked why they were sitting there so depressed.<p>"The doors of this house are kept shut against escapees," they answered. "It is now the third day since we came, and we have tried living out our expectations of company and conversation, and we are so tired of the ceaseless yammering that we can hardly stand to hear the drone of its sound. So we came to this door in disgust and knocked, but the response was, 'The doors of this house are not exits but entrances. Stay and reap the joys of heaven.' From this response we gather that we have to stay here forever, so gloom has invaded our minds, and now our chests are starting to tighten up, and we're getting desperate."<p>Then the angel spoke to them. "Your condition is that your joys are dying," he said. "You thought they were the only heavenly joys, when really they only accompany heavenly joys."<p>"So what is heavenly joy?" they asked the angel.<p>The angel answered in these few words. "It is the pleasure of doing something that is useful to yourself and to others. And the pleasure of usefulness gets its essence from love, and its outward expression from wisdom. The pleasure of usefulness that grows out of love through wisdom is the soul and life of all heavenly joys. In the heavens there are very happy parties that cheer the minds of angels, raise their spirits, delight their hearts, and refresh their bodies, but they have them after they have done useful things in their occupations or whatever they do. This is how all their joys and pleasures gain soul and life. But if that soul and life are missing, the accompanying joys become not joyful but incidental at first, then trivial, and finally dreary and troublesome."<p>Once he had said these words the door opened. The people sitting there escaped from the house and ran home, each to his occupation and work, and they recovered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #5 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>5. Saying this, the angel took the lead and was accompanied first by the company of those who had persuaded themselves that heavenly joys consisted solely in cheerful companionship and sweet conversation. These he introduced to assemblies in the northern quarter, consisting of those to whom, in the former world, these were the only joys of heaven. In that quarter was a spacious house in which such persons were gathered together, and in the house were more than fifty rooms, distinguished according to the various kinds of conversation. In some of these rooms, they were talking about things they had seen and heard in the market place and the streets. In some, they were telling pleasant stories concerning the fair sex interspersed with facetious remarks, and these were so multiplied that the countenances of all in the company expanded with hilarious laughter. In other rooms they talked about the news of courts, of ministries, of the body politic, and of various matters which had emanated from secret committees, <sup >1</sup>together with arguments and conjectures respecting future events. In others, they talked of business; in others, on literary subjects; in others, of such things as pertain to civic prudence and moral life; in others, about ecclesiastical affairs and the sects; and so on. It was granted me to look into this house, and I saw men running about from room to room, seeking out companies in harmony with their affections and so with their joy. In these companies, I observed men of three kinds; some as though panting to speak, some longing to ask questions, and others eager to listen.</p><p>[2] The house had four doors, one towards each quarter; and I noticed that many left their companies and were hastening to get out. Some of these I followed to the eastern door, and saw several sitting near it with a sad countenance. Going up to them, I asked them the cause of their sadness. They answered: "The doors of this house are kept closed against those who would go out. It is now the third day since we entered, and we have exhausted the life of our desire in companies and conversations, and are so utterly wearied, with continual chattering that we can scarcely bear to hear the murmur of the sound thereof. Therefore, in weariness we betook ourselves to this door and knocked. But we are answered: "The doors of this house are not opened for those who would go out but only for those who would come in. Remain and enjoy the joys of heaven." From this answer, we conclude that we must remain here to eternity, and therefore sadness has invaded our minds. And now our breast begins to be oppressed and anxiety overtakes us."</p><p>[3] The angel then spoke to them and said: "This state is the death of the joys which you believed to be alone heavenly, when yet they are nothing but accessories of heavenly joys." They then asked the angel, "What then is heavenly joy?" and the angel replied briefly: "It is the delight of doing something which is of use to oneself and to others; and the delight of use derives its essence from love, and its existence from wisdom. The delight of use springing from love by means of wisdom is the soul and life of all heavenly joys.</p><p>[4] In the heavens there are most cheerful companionships, which exhilarate the minds of the angels, are pleasing to their animi, <sup >2</sup>delight their breasts and recreate their bodies. But they enjoy these delights after they have performed the uses of their employments and occupations. From these uses comes the soul and life in all their joys and pleasures, and if you take away this soul or life, the accessory joys successively become joyless, becoming first indifferent, then like trifles, and finally sad and distressing."<p>When these words had been spoken, the door was opened, and those sitting by it sprang out and fled to their homes, each to his own employment and his own work; and they received new life.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The "secret committee" was an important arm of the Swedish government. It was elected from the three Houses--Nobles, Clergy, and Burghers--and its members were sworn to keep secret its transactions.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Throughout Swedenborg's theological and philosophical works, the word animus (plural, animi) is used to designate the external mind which man has in common with animals, as distinguished from mens designating the rational mind which is peculiar to man. Animus also means the disposition, and is sometimes so translated in the present work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #5 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>5. So saying, the angel led the way and was followed first by the company of those who had persuaded themselves that heavenly joys consist in very cheerful social life and highly entertaining talk. The angel took them to assemblies in the northern quarter, composed of those who in the world had had this same conception of the joys of heaven. These were gathered in a large house, of more than fifty rooms, each room distinguished by a different kind of conversation. In some of the rooms people were talking about what they had seen and heard in city square or street. In others they talked about the many charms of the fair sex, with pleasantries kept up until the faces of all in the company expanded in smiles of merriment. In other rooms they talked over the news of the palace, of the ministries, of the body politic, or of various matters which had transpired from privy councils, adding their reasonings and conjectures about the outcome. In still other rooms, they talked about business, things literary, concerns of civic prudence and the moral life, or about ecclesiastical matters and the sects; and so on. I was allowed to look into the house. I saw people running from room to room, seeking companionship to their taste and enjoyment. They were of three sorts: some panted to talk, some longed to ask questions, and some were eager to listen.</p><p>[2] The house had four doors, one towards each quarter; and I noticed that many had abandoned their companies and were hurrying to get out. I followed some to the east door, and seated there I saw a number looking downcast. I approached and asked why they sat there so sad. They replied: "The entrances of this house are tightly closed against those who would leave. We have now been here three days and have exhausted our desire for company and conversation. We are so wearied by the constant talking that we can hardly endure the murmur of it. In our tedium we betook ourselves to this door and knocked. We were told that the doors are not opened to let any one out, only to let people in. 'Remain and enjoy the joys of heaven. The reply makes us think we must remain here to eternity. Our minds have been seized by sadness and our breasts feel oppressed. We are filled with foreboding."</p><p>[3] The angel then addressed them and said, "Your state is the sure doom of the joys which you thought were the only heavenly ones, but which as a matter of fact are only accompaniments of heavenly joy."<p>They asked the angel, "What then is heavenly joy?"<p>He replied briefly: "It is the joy of doing something of use to oneself and others. The joy of service has its essence from love, and its existence by wisdom. Originating from love by wisdom, that joy is the soul and life of all heavenly joys.</p><p>[4] There are, indeed, very cheerful social occasions in heaven, exhilarating and diverting the mind, rejoicing the heart, and recreating the body; the angels enjoy them after they have done the uses of their employments and occupations. The soul and life of all their cheer and diversions comes from these uses. If you remove this soul and life, any attendant joys gradually cease to be joys, becoming first indifferent, then valueless, and finally gloomy and anxious."<p>Thereupon the door was opened, and those sitting by it leaped up and ran home, to be revived each in his employment and work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #5 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>5. Having said this the angel went before and was followed, first by the company of those who had persuaded themselves that heavenly joys consisted solely of most delightful companionship and most agreeable conversation. The angel brought them to companies in the northern quarter, of those who in the former world had the same conception of the joys of heaven. There was a spacious house in which such were gathered. There were more than fifty rooms in the house, distinguished according to the various kinds of conversation. In some of the rooms they were talking about such things as they had seen and heard in public places and in the streets; in some they talked of the various loveliness of the fair sex, intermingled with pleasantries, which increased until the countenances of all in the company expanded with smiles of merriment; in other rooms they talked of the news about the court, about the ministries, state polity, various matters which had become known from privy councils, together with reasonings and conjectures respecting the events; in others, they talked of business; in others, on literary subjects; in others, of such things as pertain to civil prudence and to moral life; in others, about ecclesiastic affairs, and the sects; and so on. It was given me to look into this house; and I saw them running about from room to room, seeking companionships of their affections and thence of their joys. And among these companionships I observed three kinds; some panting as it were to speak, some longing to make inquiries, and others eager to hear. There were four entrances to the house, one towards each quarter; and I noticed that many left the companies and were hastening to get out. I followed some of them to the eastern door, and saw several sitting near it with sad countenances; and I approached and asked why they were sitting in such sadness. They answered, 'The doors of this house are kept closed to those who wish to go out; and it is now the third day since we entered, and we have lived the life of our desire for company and conversation, and are utterly wearied with continual talking, insomuch that we can scarcely bear to hear the murmur of their sound. From irksomeness therefore, we came to this door and knocked, but are answered that 'the doors of this house are not opened for going out, but for coming in. Remain, and delight in the joys of heaven.' From which answer we infer that we must continue here to eternity. This is the cause of the sadness that has entered our minds; and now our hearts begin to be oppressed and anxiety arises.'<p>The angel then spoke to them, and said, 'This state is the death of your joys, which you believed to be alone heavenly although in truth they are but the accessories of heavenly joys.' And they asked the angel:<p>'What then is heavenly joy?'<p>To which the angel replied in these few words:<p>'It is the delight of doing something that is useful to ourselves and to others; and the delight of use derives its essence from love and its existence from wisdom. The delight of use springing from love by wisdom is the life and soul of all heavenly joys. There are most joyous companionships in the heavens, which gladden the minds of angels, amuse their spirits, fill their bosoms with delight, and revive their bodies; but they enjoy these delights when they have performed the uses of their employments and occupations. From these are the soul and life in all their joys and pleasures; but if you take away this soul or life the accessory joys successively become no joys, but become at first indifferent, then as if frivolous, and finally bring sadness and anxiety.' When these words had been said the door was opened, and those sitting near sprang out and fled to their homes, everyone to his employment and to his occupation, and revived. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #5 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>5. His dictis, Angelus praeivit, et primum comitata est illum Cohors ex illis, qui sibi persuaserant, quod Gaudia Coelestia essent solum laetissima consortia, et suavissimae confabulationes: hos Angelus introduxit ad Caetus in Plaga Septentrionali, quibus Gaudia Coeli in Mundo priori non alia fuerant. Erat ibi spatiosa Domus in quam tales congregati sunt; in Domo erant plus quam quinquaginta Camerae, distinctae secundum varia genera Confabulationum; in his Cameris loquebantur de talibus quae viderant et audiverant in foro et in plateis: in illis loquebantur varia amabilia de sexu pulchro, interspersis facetiis, adauctis usque ad expansionem facierum omnium in consortio in risus hilaritatis: in aliis Cameris loquebantur Novellas de Aulis, de Ministeriis, de Statu politico, de variis quae e Secretis consiliis emanaverunt, una cum ratiociniis et conjecturis de eventibus; in aliis de Negotiatione; in aliis de Rebus literatis; in aliis de talibus quae sunt Prudentiae civilis, et Vitae moralis; in aliis de Ecclesiasticis et de Sectis, et sic porro: datum mihi est inspicere in illam Domum, et vidi discurrentes a Cameris in Cameras, inquirentes consortia suae affectionis et inde gaudii; et in consortiis vidi tria genera, quosdam sicut anhelos ad loquendum, quosdam cupidos ad sciscitandum, et quosdam avidos ad audiendum.</p><p>[2] Erant quatuor portae Domus, una ad quamlibet plagam, et observavi quod plures solverent consortia, et properarent ad exeundum; sequutus sum quosdam ad portam Orientalem, et vidi aliquos juxta illam sedentes facie tristi, et accessi et quaesivi, cur ita tristes sederent; et responderunt, "portae hujus Domus tenentur clausae pro exituris, et nunc tertius dies est, a quo intravimus, et exegimus vitam desiderii nostri in consortiis et colloquiis, et a continuis sermocinationibus defatigati sumus in tantum, ut vix sustineamus audire sonorum murmur ex illis; quare ex <sup>1</sup>taedio contulimus nos ad hanc portam, et pulsavimus, sed responsum nobis est, quod portae hujus Domus non aperiantur exituris, sed intraturis; 'manete et fruimini gaudiis Coeli;' ex quibus responsis conclusimus, quod hic in aeternum permansuri simus; inde tristitia invasit mentes nostras, et nunc incipit pectus contrahi, et oboriri anxietas."</p><p>[3] Tunc alloquutus est illos Angelus, et dixit, "hic status est lethus gaudiorum vestrorum, quae credidistis unice coelestia esse, cum tamen non sunt nisi quam accessoria Coelestium:" et quaesiverunt Angelum, "quid ergo est Gaudium Coeleste;" et angelus respondit haec pauca; "est jucundum faciendi aliquid quod est sibi et aliis usui; et jucundum usus trahit suam essentiam ex Amore et existentiam ex Sapientia; jucundum usus oriundum ex Amore per Sapientiam est anima et vita omnium gaudiorum Coelestium.</p><p>[4] Sunt in Coelis laetissima Consortia, quae Angelorum mentes exhilarant, animos oblectant, pectora jucundant, et corpora recreant; sed haec illis sunt, postquam usus in functionibus suis et in operibus suis fecerunt; <sup>2</sup>ex his est anima et vita in omnibus laetitiis et oblectamentis illorum; at si illam animam seu vitam aufers, accessoria gaudia successive non fiunt gaudia, sed primum fiunt adiaphora, deinde sicut nauci, et demum tristia et anxia."
