<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>108、天使从从银鼎里取出第五张纸，从中读到如下内容：“我们同胞在桌旁充分运用我们心智的理性能力，探究了婚姻之爱及其活力或性能力的源头，并凭理性仔细检查，发现并肯定：婚姻之爱除了以下事实外，没有其它源头，即：出于藏在心灵和身体密室中的煽动物和由此产生的刺激物，每个男人在经历各种眼目情欲后，内心最终锁定他所倾向的一位女性，直到他的激情因她而逐渐火热。从这时起，他的热逐渐发展为一连串的火焰，直到它变成一团火。在此状态下，性欲（sexual lust）被逐出，婚姻之爱取而代之。当年轻的新郎因这火而炽热时，他没有意识到这爱的活力或性能力会永远消退。因为他缺乏能教导他的经验，不知道它的力量会衰竭，欢娱过后爱情会变得冷淡。因此，婚姻之爱的源头来自婚礼前的最初热情，这也是其活力或性能力的源头。然而，婚礼过后，其性能力会交替燃烧，时强时弱。不过，它仍会持续到老，并以恒定的节奏时强时弱，因为它会被谨慎所约束，而从尚未净化的心灵洞穴迸发出来的欲望会被抑制。事实上，欲望是智慧的先导。这就是我们对婚姻之爱及其活力或性能力的源头和持续的判断。”这张纸标注的字母是P（波兰）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>108、天使又抽出第五张纸读道：</p><p>“我们组的人经过周密考虑后，认为婚姻之爱的来源及其力量是基于以下情况：</p><p>隐藏在人身上和头脑中的动机在经历不同的视觉上的性刺激后，每个人都会将注意力转向一个女性，最终他心中将对她充满热情，就像是一团火在燃烧一样，此时婚姻之爱就取代了性爱。</p><p>“这种状态下的男人将要结婚，他此时认为这种婚姻之爱将永远存在。因为他还没有经历，不知道什么情况下这种爱的力量会消失，什么情况下爱会冷却。”</p><p>“因此，婚姻之爱来自于婚前阶段的热情，并且婚姻之爱的力量也由此而来。婚后这种火一样的热情会变化，有时变弱，有时增强，通过自我控制或者说抵制淫乱，这种爱的力量是会渐增或减弱，淫爱先于智慧而存地。”</p><p>“这就是我们对婚姻之爱来源及其力量的判断。”</p><p>这一论断来自波兰人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #108 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>108. He then took the fifth paper from the urn and read it out as follows.<p>'We, the representatives at our table, have employed the rational faculty of our minds to look into the source of conjugial love and that of its strength or potency. Having taken an all-round look at the reasons, we have seen and proved that the only source is the fact that everyone as a result of the stimuli and their prodding which lie concealed in the depths of his mind and body finds his eyes leading him to varying lusts, but eventually he concentrates and shapes his mind towards one member of the female sex, until his passion for her grows hot. From this time on his heat develops a series of flames, until it becomes a fire. In that state sexual lust departs and the place of lust is taken by conjugial love. When the young bridegroom is hot with this fire, he is unaware that the strength or potency of that love will ever fade, since he lacks the experience which could teach him about the way its strength declines and love cools off after achieving its delights. The source of conjugial love therefore is from that first ardour which precedes marriage, and this is also the source of its strength or potency. But after the wedding there is a change in his potency, and it increases and decreases in turn. But it still lasts until old age, decreasing and increasing in a constant rhythm, because it is controlled by prudence and the lusts are checked which burst out of the as yet unpurified caverns of the mind. For lust is the forerunner of wisdom. This is our judgment about the source and persistence of marital strength or potency.' This paper was signed with the letter P. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #108 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>108. A fifth time the angel drew a piece of paper from the urn, and he read from it the following opinion:<p>"We fellow countrymen at our table, with the rationality our minds possess, looked into the origin of conjugial love and the origin of its vigor or potency. And with well-considered reasonings we saw and confirmed that conjugial love takes its origin simply from the following circumstance: that owing to inflammations and thus stimulations concealed in the inmost recesses of his mind and body, after experiencing various lusts with his eyes, everybody at last turns and inclines his mind to one of the feminine sex, until he inwardly burns with passion for her. From that time on, his burning passion mounts from flame to flame till it becomes a blazing fire. In this state sexual lust is banished, and instead of lust comes conjugial love.<p>"In this blazing state of passion, a young man engaged to be married does not know but that the vigor or potency of this love will never cease, for he has not experienced and so does not know about the state in which the powers fail and in which love then grows cool after its delights are over.<p>"The origin of conjugial love, therefore, comes from that first state of passion before the wedding, and from this comes its vigor or potency. After the wedding, however, its fires change, sometimes lessening, sometimes increasing. But still its potency continues with steady change or with a steady lessening and increasing until old age, by the prudent exercise of self-control and by restraining the lusts that break out from the caverns of the mind before they have been cleansed of their filth. For lust exists before wisdom.<p>"That is our judgment regarding the origin and continuance of conjugial vigor or potency."<p>This statement was signed below with the letter P. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #108 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>108. For the fifth time the angel pulled a paper from the urn, and he read this from it:<p>"We countrymen at our table have looked into the origin of married love and of its vigor or potency with rational minds, and from careful deliberation we have seen and confirmed that the origin of married love is nothing but this. Every man has the stimuli and the excitements of it hidden deep in his mind and body. After eyeing many women he finally turns his attention to one female and sets his mind on her until he has a warm glow inside for her. From this time his heat sets one fire after another until there is a conflagration. In this condition his general yearning for the other sex is banished, and marital love takes its place. A young husband, afire like this, does not know but what the energy or potency of this love will never end, for he never experienced a condition without sexual energy and therefore does not know about such a condition and about love cooling off after its delights.<p>"50 the source of married love is this first ardor before marriage, and from this comes its vigor or potency. But after the nuptial torches, the potency changes. It ebbs and flows. But it still lasts, with steady change, ebbing and flowing, until old age - by prudent moderation and by reining in desires that break out of caverns of the mind that are not yet cleaned out. For lust precedes wisdom.<p>"This is our verdict about the origin and preservation of marital vigor or potency."<p>This was signed P. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #108 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>108. For the FIFTH time the angel drew a paper from the urn, from which he read as follows: "We compatriots at our table, from the rational light of our minds, have looked into the origin of conjugial love and the origin of its virtue or potency, and, from reasons carefully examined, have seen and affirmed that conjugial love has no other origin than the fact that from the foments and the resultant incitements concealed in the secret chamber of his mind and body, every man, after various lusts of his eyes, at last directs his mind to one of the sex to whom he inclines, until he grows inwardly warm towards her. From this time his heat proceeds from flame to flame until it becomes a consuming fire. In this state, the lust of the sex is banished and in place of lust comes conjugial love. In this burning, a youthful husband knows no other than that the virtue or potency of that love will never cease; for he lacks experience and thence knowledge respecting the state of deficiency of powers and of the consequent cooling of love after its delights. The origin of conjugial love, therefore, is from that first ardor before the nuptials; and from this is its virtue or potency. After the nuptials, this potency alternates its flames and has its decrease and increase; yet, by the exercise of moderation from prudence, and by restraining the lusts which rush out from the caverns of a mind not yet purified--for lust precedes wisdom--it endures with stable alternation or decrease and increase even to old age. This is our judgment respecting the origin and long continuance of conjugial virtue and potency." To this was subscribed the letter P. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #108 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>108. A fifth time the angel took a paper from the urn and read from it as follows: "We compatriots at our table have looked by the rational light of our minds into the origin of marital love, and into the origin of its vigor or potency. We have seen and confirmed by careful reasonings that the origin of marital love is none other than this: due to cravings and their urgings concealed in the secret chambers of mind and body, a man, after various lusts of the eyes, at length turns and inclines his mind to one woman, until he inwardly kindles toward her. From this time his ardor proceeds from flame to flame until he is all on fire. Lust toward the sex is banished then, and marital love arises in its place. In his ardor a young husband does not know but that the vigor or potency of this love will never cease; for he has no experience and hence no knowledge of a state of deficient powers or of the cooling of love after its delights. Marital love has its origin, therefore, in this first ardor before the nuptials; and its vigor or potency is thence. But after love's nuptial torches potency changes, decreasing and increasing; and yet, with steady alternation in decreasing and increasing, it endures even to old age if there is prudent moderation and if the lusts are bridled which break out from the still uncleansed caverns of the mind. For lust precedes wisdom. This is our judgment respecting the origin and persistence of marital vigor and potency." To this was subscribed the letter P. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #108 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>108. The fifth time he took a paper from the urn from which he read as follows: We compatriots, at our table, from the rational light of our minds have looked into the origin of conjugial love, and the origin of its virtue or potency, and have seen and confirmed by careful reasonings that the origin of conjugial love is none other than this: That every man, from the cravings and thence incitements concealed in the secret chamber of his mind and body, after various longings of his eyes, at length directs and inclines his mind to one of the female sex, until he inwardly burns towards her. From this time his heat increases from flame to flame until he is all on fire. In this state the love of the sex is banished, and instead of lust there arises conjugial love. A youthful husband in this burning does not know but that the virtue or potency of that love will never cease; for he is without experience and hence without the knowledge of a state of deficiency of his powers, and of the cooling of the love after its delights. The origin of conjugial love therefore, is from this first ardor before the nuptials; and from this is its virtue or potency. But after its nuptial torches this changes, decreases, and increases; and yet with stable change - that is, decreasing and increasing - it endures even to old age by prudent moderation, and by the bridling of the lusts, that break forth from the caverns of the mind not yet cleansed. For lust precedes wisdom. This is our judgment respecting the origin and preservation of conjugial virtue and potency.' To this was subscribed the letter P. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #108 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>108. Quinto eduxit chartam ex urna, ex qua legit haec. "Nos populares ad nostram Mensam ex mentium nostrarum rationalitate inspeximus in originem Amoris Conjugialis, ac in Originem Virtutis seu potentiae ejus; et originem Amoris conjugialis non aliam ex circumspectis rationibus vidimus et confirmavimus, quam quod omnis homo ex fomitibus et inde incitamentis in adyto mentis et corporis ejus occultatis post varias oculorum ejus libidines tandem ad unam e sexu foeminam intendat mentem et acclinet, usque dum ad illam penitus incalescat; ab hoc tempore calor ejus a flamma in flammam abit, usque dum fit incendium; in hoc statu exulat libido sexus, et pro libidine fit amor conjugialis: adolescens sponsus in hoc incendio non scit aliter, quam quod virtus seu potentia illius amoris nusquam desitura sit, caret enim experientia et inde scientia de statu defectus virium, et tunc frigescentiae amoris post delitias; est itaque origo amoris conjugialis ex primo illo ante nuptias ardore, et ex hoc virtus seu potentia ejus; at haec post nuptias faces suas mutat, ac decrescit et increscit, sed usque perstat cum stabili mutatione, seu decrescentia et increscentia usque ad senium, per moderationes ex prudentia, et per refraenationes libidinum erumpentium ex specubus mentis nondum defaecatis; libido enim anteit sapientiam; hoc nostrum judicium est de origine et perseverantia virtutis seu potentiae conjugialis."
