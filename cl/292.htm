<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第292节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>292、(21)世上有地狱般的婚姻；在这类婚姻中，夫妻内在是不共戴天的死敌，而外在却像最亲密的朋友。在灵界，这类妻子禁止我公开谈论这些婚姻。因为她们唯恐她们能用来获得对丈夫权力的手段同时被泄露出去，她们一心想把这些手段藏得严严的。但灵界的男人们却鼓励我披露他们极端憎恨的原因，几乎可以这样说，由于这些秘密手段，他们内心对自己的妻子充满狂怒。我只想简单说这几句：男人们说，他们下意识地对自己的妻子产生可怕的恐惧。这使得他们只能乖乖服从她们的命令，比最卑贱的仆人还要谄媚地顺从她们的心血来潮，以致他们仿佛成了无名小卒。他们说，不仅那些平凡的小人物对他们的妻子是这个态度，就连那些身居高位的男人，甚至强势、杰出的领袖也是如此。沦落到如此恐怖的境地后，他们不敢不友好地与妻子说话，或不敢做不讨她们喜欢的任何事，不管他们内心多么仇恨她们。他们补充说，他们的妻子对他们说话依旧客客气气，举止也彬彬有礼，并且还会洗耳恭听他们的某些要求。<br><br>男人们自己对于内在这种源于妻子的极度反感和外在的这种近乎赞同从何而来大为困惑，于是便请教深谙此道的女人们，以找出原因。他们告诉我说，他们从这些女人嘴里得知：女人若愿意，就能利用手段使男人们臣服在其控制的枷锁下；不过，她们将这些手段藏得极深。粗俗的妻子通过轮番责骂和示好做到这一点；有时她们总是板起面孔、正颜厉色，有时用其它方法。有教养的妻子做到这一点，则通过一刻不停地坚持顽固要求，倔强地反抗丈夫，即便被丈夫恶待，也要坚持法律所赋予她们的平等权利，并基于这种权利大胆坚持自己的固执。事实上，她们声称，哪怕被赶出家门，她们也会随时回来，继续提出类似要求。因为她们了解男人们的本性，知道他们根本受不了妻子们的软磨硬泡，一旦顺从她们的意愿，就受她们控制了。此时，面对受她们控制的丈夫，妻子则示以礼貌和殷勤。妻子利用这种伎俩实现控制的真正原因在于，男人的行为受理解力支配，而女人的行为受意志支配。意志能顽固到底，而理解力不能。我被告知，这类女人当中最坏的，因内心充满控制的野心，甚至在咽下最后一口气时仍能顽强坚持抵抗。<br><br>我还听见女人们的借口，以解释她们为何采取这种手段。她们声称，若非早就预料到她们向丈夫臣服后会被大大地藐视、弃绝和毁灭，她们决不会走到这一步。所以，她们有必要拿起武器。她们还补充了这一点，以作为对男人们的警告：把权利留给妻子；当处于冷淡的交替状态时，不要把妻子看得比女仆还低贱。她们还说，许多女性就是因为天生太过羞怯，以至于没有采取这种手段。不过，我插了一句：“她们是天生太谦逊。”这些经历使我意识到世上那些内在是不共戴天的死敌，而外在却像最亲密朋友的夫妻之间地狱般的婚姻指的是哪类婚姻。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>292、（21）在世间有地狱一般的婚姻，在这种婚姻中，夫妻双方在内心中视对方为敌人，而在外在上却表现得象最好的朋友。</p><p>其实，精神世界的妻子们不准我透露她们是通过什么手段而控制男人的。这是他们极力保守的秘密，但在精神世界中被控制的男人心中的敌意和愤怒的驱动下，我将做以下讲述。</p><p>那里的男人说他们无意识地就有一种对妻子的畏惧，结果就使得他们象奴隶一样服从妻子。他们自己就变成了没有精神的懦夫，他们还说，处于这种状态的男人不仅有没有地位的男人，一些地位高的领导人甚至也会屈服于妻子。他们说一旦自己有了这种对妻子的畏惧，他们只能用友好的语气与妻子讲话，尽管他们内心对妻子是仇恨的。然而他们的妻子也会与他们表现得谦和，还会倾听他们的一些请求。</p><p>男人们会对自己的憎恨心情和外在的友好表现而感到困惑，他们从女人那找到了原因。一些女人告诉他们，女人有深藏于其中的手段，能够使男人屈服于自己。他们说没有教养的女人会通过责骂和时不时的称赞达到对丈夫进行控制的目的，有教养的女人会通过永不间断的要求，坚持丈夫听从自己而达到控制丈夫的目的。既使这些女人被赶出家门，他们说她们还会回来。因为她们知道男人的本性使他们没法避免屈服于妻子的不懈努力，男人一旦妥协，女人就会使他们服从自己的愿望。男人说这时候，当女人使得男人服从自己后，女人就会对丈夫表现出友善，谦敬的态度。</p><p>（女人能够通过这种手段而取得控制权是因为男人按头脑中的才智而行为，而女人是按自己的意愿而行为。意愿可能会是固执的，但才智却不会这样，我知道这样的女人会从生到死不间断地渴望控制权。）</p><p>我还听到精神世界中的这样的女人对自己之所以是这样，所做好的辩解，她们说自己之所以会对丈夫行使这行手段是因为她们看到若自己被丈夫所压倒，那么他们将得到丈夫的轻视和拒绝。所以，出于必要她们才持起这种手段为做为武器。她们还对男作了以下的警告：给女人她们应有的权力，不要低视女人，不要对奴仆那样对待女人。她们说：“很多女人都是生来不愿意去用这些手段的。”</p><p>很清楚，我们所讲的世间的象地狱一样的婚姻是什么样的。这样的婚姻中的双方在内心视对方为敌人，而在外表上却象是最亲密的朋友。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #292 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>292. (xxi) Hellish marriages are possible in the world between couples who are inwardly out-and-out enemies, but outwardly the best of friends.<p>Wives of this description in the spiritual world have forbidden me to speak openly about these marriages. For they are afraid of the skills which enable them to gain power over their husbands being revealed at the same time, when they want nothing more than to keep them concealed. But since I am encouraged by men in that world to disclose the reasons for their peculiar hatred, I might almost say the rage introduced into their hearts against their wives as the result of their secret skills, I should like simply to present the following remarks.<p>The men said that without being aware of it they had acquired a terrifying fear of their wives. This made them unable to do anything but submissively obey their orders, deferring to their whims more humbly than the meanest servants, so that they became as it were nobodies. They said that it was not only those who hold no important position who took this attitude to their wives, but also men of high rank, even powerful and distinguished leaders. After being reduced to such terror, they dare not talk with their wives in any but friendly fashion, or do anything which did not please them, despite the intense hatred they felt for them in their hearts. They added that their wives still talked and behaved politely to them, and meekly gave in to some of their requests.</p><p>[2] Now since the men themselves were very puzzled about the source of such a strong antipathy on the part of the women <sup >1</sup>at the inner levels, while they showed almost sympathy at the outer levels, they went to women expert in that secret skill to investigate it. They told me that they had it from the women's own lips, that females keep very deeply hidden the skill that enables them to subject men, if they wish, to the yoke of their control. Uneducated wives do this by alternately scolding and being nice. In other cases they do it by keeping constantly a stern and severe expression on their faces, in other similar cases by other means. Wives of the educated classes do it by keeping up obstinate demands without a break, and by stubborn resistance to their husbands, if they treat them badly, insisting on the equal rights conferred by law, to which they cling determinedly. In fact, they claim that even if they are thrown out of their homes, they will come back as soon as they please and continue to make similar demands. For they know that men's nature does not allow them to resist their wives' obstinacy, and that once they have given in they submit to their control. Then the wives when in control put on a show of politeness and flattery to their husbands.<p>The real reason for wives establishing their control by this trickery is that a man's actions are directed by his intellect, a woman's by her will. The will can be obstinate, but not the intellect. I was told that the worst women of this sort, who are totally hooked on the pursuit of domination, can keep up their obstinacy to the point of risking their lives.</p><p>[3] I have also heard the defence women put up, to explain why they resorted to using this skill. They claimed that they would never have started, had they not foreseen that if they became subject to their husbands, they would have been utterly despised, rejected and ruined. It was therefore necessity which made them take up arms. They added this warning to men, to leave wives their rights, and when at intervals they are cold to them, not to consider them as more worthless than servant-girls. They also said that many of their sex are by nature too timid to pursue such a course; but I interjected that they were by nature too modest.<p>These experiences have now made me aware what sort of marriages are meant by hellish marriages in the world, between couples who are inwardly out-and-out enemies and outwardly the best of friends. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #292 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>292. 21. There are hellish marriages in the world in which the partners are inwardly bitter enemies and yet outwardly seem like the closest of friends. Actually, I am forbidden by wives of this sort in the spiritual world to bring the existence of such marriages to public notice; for they are afraid that their art of acquiring power over men will be exposed at the same time, which they for their part are extremely eager to keep concealed. However, being spurred by men in the same world to make known the reasons for their internal hatred and virtual rage, injected into their hearts against their wives in consequence of those secret arts of theirs, I would like simply to present here the following reports.<p>According to the men, they unconsciously contracted a terrific fear of their wives. As a result they could not help but slavishly obey their wives' wishes and do their bidding more submissively than the humblest of servants, so that they became practically spiritless weaklings. Moreover, they said, those who became such in relation to their wives included not only men without any standing or position, but also men in high standing and great position, even strong and distinguished leaders. They said, too, that after contracting this terror they could not work up any courage to speak with their wives in other than a friendly way, or to do for them anything but what met their fancy, even though they harbored a deadly hatred towards their wives in their hearts. And yet their wives continued to speak and behave with them in courteous fashion, they said, and to listen dutifully to some of their requests.</p><p>[2] Now because these men wondered themselves why there arose in them such animosity inwardly and such apparent amiability outwardly, they sought the reasons from women who knew the secret art that caused it; and from what those women told them, they said, they learned that women deeply conceal a knowledge within them by which they know how to skillfully tame men, if they wish, and make them subject to their command. They learned further that, on the part of ill-bred wives, this is accomplished by scoldings and periodic commendations; in some cases by continually hard and unpleasant looks, and in similar cases by other tactics. On the part of well-bred wives, however, it is accomplished by persistent and incessant pressings of requests, and by stubbornly resisting and opposing their husbands if they suffer hardships on their account, insisting on their right of equality by law and making themselves brazenly obstinate because of it. Even if they were to be expelled from the house, they say, they would return at will and continue to pursue the same demands. For they know that the nature of men makes it altogether impossible for them to withstand the persistent efforts of their wives, and that once men have yielded they then submit themselves to their wives' wishes. At that point, said the men, once the wives have them under their control, they then show their husbands courteous and amiable treatment.<p>(The real reason wives are able to gain control by such guile is that a man acts in accord with his intellect and a woman in accord with her will; and the will can be stubborn, but not the intellect. I have been told that the worst of this lot are inwardly consumed with a desire to rule and can doggedly stick to their persistent endeavors even to the last breath of life.)</p><p>[3] I have also heard justifications from the aforementioned women in the spiritual world as to why they entered into the practice of this art. They said they would not have entered into it except that they foresaw the supreme contempt, future rejection and thus utter ruin that lay ahead for them if they were to be beaten down by their husbands. Thus, they said, out of necessity they had taken up these weapons of theirs. To this they added the following warning for men, to leave to their wives their rights, and when they experience periodic states of coldness, not to regard their wives as inferior and treat them worse than they would servants. They said as well that many of their sex are not prepared to practice this art owing to an innate timidity (though I put in, owing to an innate modesty.)<p>This now is sufficient to make known what we mean by hellish marriages in the world, in which the partners are inwardly bitter enemies and yet outwardly seem like the closest of friends. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #292 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>292. 21. There are hellish marriages in the world between married partners who inwardly are the bitterest enemies and outwardly are like the closest friends. Actually wives like that, in the spiritual world, forbid me to tell the public about these marriages. They are afraid I would divulge their art of gaining power over men, and they are very anxious to keep it hidden. But men in that world urge me to tell why they have a gut hatred for their wives and a fury stirred up against them in their hearts, so to speak, on account of their secret arts, so all I will say is this. Men have said that they unconsciously contracted a terrible fear of their wives, and it made them totally obedient to their wives' will, more submissive to their nod than the lowest slaves, so they were practically worthless.<p>And wives did this not just to men with no position in the world, but also to men of high standing; in fact, even valiant and renowned generals. And they said that once they had this terror they did not dare speak to their wives except in a friendly way, nor do anything to them except what pleased them, though they nursed a murderous hate for their wives in their hearts. Yet their wives talked and acted courteously with them and listened compliantly to some of their requests.<p>Now, the men really wondered where such negative inner feelings and such outward sympathy could arise from, so they asked women who knew the secret art what the reasons were. The men said they had it from the women's own lips that deep within themselves women conceal knowledge of how to put men under the yoke of their authority if they want to. Coarse wives do it by alternate scolding and kindness, and others by continual hard and unpleasant looks, and others do it in other ways. Refined wives do it by obstinately pushing their requests without letup, and by doggedly opposing their husbands if the husbands are hard on them, and insisting on their equal rights under the law. They make themselves so stubborn this way that even if they are run out of the house they will come back whenever they please and take the same stand. They know that by nature there is no way men can hold out against pressure from their wives and that once the husbands concede the authority, they are submissive. Then the wives act polite and soft for the husbands under their power.<p>The real reason why wives dominate through this craft is that a man acts from intellect and a woman from will, and will can be persistent but intellect cannot. I learned that the worst of this kind, who are inwardly baited with ambition to rule, can doggedly hold onto their stubborn ways even in a struggle to the death. I have also heard the women's excuses for taking up the practice of this art. They said they would not have taken it up if they had not foreseen the extreme contempt, future rejection, and their ruin in the end, if their husbands got the upper hand over them, so they had to take up arms. They added a warning to men to let their wives have their rights and not consider them lower than slaves during their periods of coldness. They also said that many of their sex are not in a position to exercise these arts because of their inborn timidity, but I added, "because of inborn modesty."<p>From all this it is clear now what marriages we mean by infernal marriages in this world between partners who are inwardly the bitterest enemies and outwardly like the most intimate friends. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #292 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>292. XXI. THAT IN THE WORLD THERE ARE INFERNAL MARRIAGES BETWEEN PARTNERS WHO INWARDLY ARE BITTER ENEMIES AND OUTWARDLY LIKE CLOSE FRIENDS. Wives of this sort who are in the spiritual world have indeed forbidden me to set forth these marriages in public light, for they fear lest at the same time their art of gaining power over the men should be divulged, which yet they are exceedingly desirous should be concealed. But because men in that world have urged me to disclose the causes of their own intestine hatred and of the fury, as it were, aroused in their hearts against their wives because of their clandestine arts, I wish merely to present the following: the men said that unconsciously they contracted a terrific fear of their wives, on account of which they could do no otherwise than obey their will with the utmost subservience, and follow their bidding more obsequiously than the vilest slaves, so that they became like vapid wine, as it were; and that not only did men not stationed in any position of dignity become such before their wives, but also men in positions of great dignity, yea, valiant and renowned generals. They said further, that after this terror had been contracted, they did not dare to speak to their wives except in a friendly way, or to treat them except as was pleasing to them, though in their hearts they cherished deadly hatred against them; and yet that their wives talk and act courteously with them and give ready ear to some of their requests.</p><p>[2] Now because the men themselves greatly wondered whence such antipathy had sprung up in the wives' <sup >1</sup>internals, and such sympathy in their externals, they had searched into the causes by consulting women to whom that secret art was known. From their mouth they said they had learned that women deeply conceal within themselves the knowledge whereby they have the skill, if they wish to use it, to subject men to the yoke of their dominion. In the case of the vulgar, with some wives this is done by alternate scoldings and favors; with some by constantly harsh and unpleasant looks; and with others in other ways. In the case of refined wives, it is done by obstinate and incessant pressing of their requests, and by tenacious opposition to their husbands if they suffer hardships from them, insisting upon their right of equality by law, and on the basis of this right boldly persisting in their obstinacy; yea, insisting that if thrown out of the house, they will return at their pleasure and continue the same insistence; for they know that from their very nature men can never withstand the obstinate persistency of their wives, and that after yielding to their will they become submissive; then, to husbands under their dominion, the wives show civility and kindness. The genuine cause of the domination of wives through this cunning is, that while man acts from the understanding woman acts from the will, and the will can be obstinate but not the understanding. It was told me that the worst women of this sort, being inwardly consumed with the ambition to dominate, can stick tenaciously to their resistance even to the last breath of life.</p><p>[3] I have also heard the women's excuses, why they entered into the practice of this art. They said that they would not have entered into it had they not foreseen supreme contempt and future rejection, and hence their ruin, if they were subjugated by their husbands; thus, that they took up these their arms from necessity. To this they added, as a warning to men, that they should leave to wives their rights, and when in their alternations of cold, should not count them as lower than maid-servants. They said further that many of their sex are not in a state to practice this art because of their innate timidity; but I added, "because of their innate modesty."<p>From the above it is now made known what is meant by infernal marriages in the world between partners who are inwardly bitter enemies and outwardly like the closest of friends.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin is illorum (their--meaning the men), but the context indicates that it should be illarum (their - meaning the wives). </p>

(xxi) There are infernal marriages in the world between married partners who inwardly are the bitterest enemies and outwardly like the closest friends. Wives of this sort in the spiritual world indeed forbid me to expose these marriages to the light, for they fear lest their art of gaining power over men be divulged, which they are exceedingly anxious to conceal. At the same time men in that world urge me to disclose the causes of the intestine hatred and fury aroused in their hearts against their wives on account of their clandestine arts. I shall relate only the following. The men said that unconsciously they contracted a terrible fear of their wives, making it impossible for them not to be abjectly obedient to their will - more obsequious to their nod than the meanest slaves, so that they became good for nothing. Not only men of humble position had this experience, but also men of high station, even valiant and renowned generals. They said that after contracting this terror they did not dare to speak to their wives except in a friendly way or do otherwise than according to their good pleasure, although in their hearts they cherished deadly hatred against them; and yet that their wives talked and acted courteously with them and willingly granted some of their requests.</p><p>[2] Wondering greatly themselves how such antipathy had sprung up in their internals with such seeming sympathy in externals, the men had searched into the causes with the help of women to whom the secret art was known. They said that from the mouths of these women they learned that women deeply conceal in themselves the knowledge by which they understand how to subject men, when they wish, to the yoke of their authority. Unmannerly wives accomplish it by alternate scolding and favor, or by perpetual hard and unpleasant looks, or by other means. But wives of refined manners accomplish it by obstinate and incessant pressing of their requests and by firm resistance to their husbands if they suffer hard things from them, standing on their right of equality under the law, on the strength of which they are boldly stubborn, declaring that if put out of the house they will return at their pleasure and persist in their demands. For they know that men by nature can by no means withstand the persistence of their wives, and once having surrendered to their will are submissive. Thereupon the wives show civility and kindness to the husbands under their authority.<p>The real cause of a wife's dominating by such arts is that man acts from the understanding and woman from the will; the will can be obstinate but the understanding cannot. I have been told that the worst women of this sort, inwardly consumed by the ambition to rule, can hold tenaciously to their obstinacies even to a struggle for life.</p><p>[3] I have also heard the excuses of such women for engaging in these artful practices. They would not have engaged in them, they said, if they had not foreseen utter contempt and future rejection and hence ruin if they were subjugated by their husbands; of necessity therefore they took up these their weapons. They added this admonition to men, that they should leave to wives their rights, and that when at times they are in cold they should not count them meaner than slaves. They also said that many of their sex are not in position to employ this art from innate timidity. But I added, "From innate modesty." These experiences make known what is meant by infernal marriages in the world between married partners who inwardly are the bitterest enemies and outwardly are like the closest friends. </p>

But as by men in that world I am urged to disclose the causes of their intestine hatred, and of the fury as it were excited in their hearts against their wives on account of their clandestine arts, I will merely relate the following: Men have told me that, unconsciously, they contracted a terrible fear of their wives, on account of which they could not but be most slavishly obedient to their will, more obsequious to their nod than the vilest slaves, so that they became as if spiritless. And that not only did men not placed in dignity become so before their wives, but also men of exalted station, yea, valiant and renowned generals. And they said that after this terror was contracted they could not hazard to speak to their wives except in a friendly way, nor to do otherwise than according to their good pleasure, although in their hearts they cherished deadly hatred against them; and yet that their wives talked and acted courteously with them, and listened compliantly to some of their requests. Now, as the men themselves greatly wondered whence there sprang up such antipathy in their internals and such apparent sympathy in externals, they have searched into the causes, from women to whom the secret art was known, and they said that they received it out of the mouths of these, that women conceal deeply with themselves the knowledge by which they understand how to subject men, if they will, to the yoke of their authority.

For they know that men from their nature can by no means withstand the obstinate persistency of their wives, and that after surrender to their will they submit themselves, and then the wives show themselves civil and bland to the husbands under their authority.<p>The real cause of the domination of wives through this craft is that man acts from the understanding and woman from the will, and the will can be persistent but the understanding cannot.
