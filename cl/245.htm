<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第245节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>245、对于我们刚才所证实的，可能有人会提出这样的反对意见：哪怕父亲的灵魂不与母亲的灵魂联结，事实上，甚至居于灵魂深处的冷淡把他们分开，灵魂不也照样从父亲的生命得以生育吗？但是，灵魂或后代之所以仍得以生育，是因为人的理解力并未关闭到无法被提升至灵魂所享之光的地步。不过，他的意愿之爱若不藉着他所过的生活，就不会被提升至与那里的光相对应的热；正是他的生活使他从属世变得属灵。正因如此，灵魂仍得以生育，只是在下降直到变成种子或精子的过程中，被与父亲的属世之爱有关的那类元素所包裹。遗传之恶就是从这个源头涌出的。对此，我补充一个秘密，这个秘密是我从天上听来的：在两个未联结的灵魂，尤其夫妻未联结的灵魂之间，结合是在某种居间之爱的区域中完成的。否则，人类就无法怀孕。有关婚姻的冷淡及其居所，即它在心智的最高区域等主题的详细内容，可参看本章末尾（270节）的记事。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>245、讲到这可能有人会产生疑问——即使父亲的灵魂与母亲的灵魂不相结合，不是也能产生后代吗？这是因为人的才智并没有完全关闭。还能够被提升到灵魂所在的光之中。在产生生命的过程中，新的灵魂中充满着与父亲自然的爱相关的因素，这就是原罪的来处。</p><p>在此我插入一点秘密。即在两个不相统一的灵魂之间，尤其是在那些婚姻中的夫妇间，他们之间的结合会通过某些中间层面的爱而完成，否则他们将不可能繁育后代。</p><p>更多关于婚姻中的冷漠及其源头参见270节。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #245 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>245. The objection can be raised to what has been proved above, that the soul is still propagated from the father, even though it is not linked to the mother's soul, even, in fact, though there is coldness lodged there which causes separation. But the reason souls or offspring are none the less propagated is because the man's intellect is not shut off, so as to prevent it being raised into the light enjoyed by the soul. But the love of his will is not raised into the heat corresponding to the light there, except by the way he lives; this is what makes him spiritual instead of natural. This is how it is that the soul is procreated, but wrapped up as it comes down to become sperm by the kind of things which have to do with his natural love. It is from this source that hereditary evil wells up.<p>To this I shall add a secret I have been told from heaven, that between the unlinked souls of the two, especially if they are married, a linking takes place in the middle of making love; and but for this the conception of human beings could not occur. See in addition what is said about coldness in marriage, and its location in the highest region of the mind, in the last account of experiences in this chapter (<a href="270.htm">270</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #245 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>245. To what we have just affirmed, an objection may be raised on the ground that life is still procreated from the father's life - even if his soul is not united with the soul of the mother - indeed, even if a deep-seated coldness there separates them. But souls or offspring are nevertheless still procreated for the reason that a man's intellect is not so closed up that it cannot be elevated into the light that the soul is in (in contrast with love in his will, which is not elevated into a warmth corresponding to the light there except by his living a life which transforms his character from natural to spiritual).<p>It is owing to this that life is still procreated, but during its descent, until it becomes seed or sperm, the soul is enveloped by elements of a type that have to do with the father's natural love. This is the source from which hereditary evil springs.<p>To this I will add a secret, which I have from heaven, that between two disunited souls, especially those of married partners, conjunction is accomplished in the area of some intermediary love. Otherwise conceptions would not occur among human beings.<p>(For more on the subject of coldness in marriage and where it has its seat - namely, in the highest region of the mind - see the concluding narrative account at the end of this chapter, no. <a href="270.htm">270</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #245 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>245. A rebuttal to the above demonstration can be made on the grounds that the father's soul does reproduce even if it is not in union with the mother's soul - even if a coldness residing there separates them, in fact. The reason why souls or offspring are conceived in spite of this, however, is that the man's intellect is not closed off enough to keep it from rising into the light where his soul is. But the love of his will is not raised into the warmth that corresponds to the light there. Only a life that makes him spiritual instead of worldly can do this. This is why a soul is still conceived. But as it is descending, becoming seed, elements of the man's worldly love cover it over. This is where hereditary evil springs from.<p>I add to this something unknown from heaven. Between two disunited souls, especially partners, the union takes place in love on an intermediate level. Otherwise there would be no conception among people.<p>In addition to what I have said about marital coldness and how its seat is in the highest region of the mind, see the last story in this chapter (no. 270). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #245 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>245. Against what has been confirmed above, the objection may be made that a soul is propagated from the father even though it is not conjoined with the soul of the mother, yea, even though the cold there residing separates them. The reason why souls or offspring are propagated despite this, is because the man's understanding is not so closed but that it can be elevated into the light in which the soul is, though the love of his will is not elevated into the heat corresponding to the light there, except by a life which from natural makes him spiritual. Hence it is, that the soul is still procreated; but in its descent, while becoming seed, it is covered over by such things as are of the man's natural love. From this springs hereditary evil. To the above I will add an arcanum which comes from heaven: Between the disunited souls of two, especially partners, a conjunction is effected in a mediate love; otherwise there would be no conceptions among men. In addition to what has been said concerning conjugial cold and concerning its seat as being in the supreme region of the mind, see the last Memorable Relation of this chapter (no. <a href="270.htm">270</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #245 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>245. To what we have affirmed above it may be objected that the soul is propagated nevertheless from the father, even though his soul is not conjoined to the mother's soul, nay, even if cold, resident in it, separates the two. But souls or offspring are propagated nevertheless, because the man's understanding is not closed up so that it cannot be raised into the light in which the soul is (though the love of his will is not raised into a heat corresponding to the light there, save by a life which from natural makes him spiritual). Hence the soul is still procreated, but as it descends and becomes seed, is enveloped with such things as are of man's natural love; from this springs inherited evil. I shall add to this an arcanum from heaven: conjunction between the disjoined souls of two, especially of partners, is effected through a medial love; otherwise no conceptions would take place with mankind. For more about marital cold and its seat in the highest region of the mind, see the last Memorabilia in this chapter (<a href="270.htm">270</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #245 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>245. The objection may be raised, against the things confirmed above, that still the soul from the father is propagated, although it is not conjoined with the soul of the mother, yea, although cold residing there separates. But the reason why nevertheless souls or offspring are propagated, is that the understanding of the man is not closed, but that it can be elevated into the light in which the soul is, although the love of his will is not elevated into the heat correspondent to the light there, except by a life which from natural makes him spiritual. Hence it is that nevertheless the soul is procreated; but in its descent, while it is becoming seed, it is covered over by such things as are of his natural love. From this springs hereditary evil. I will add to this a secret which is from heaven: That between the disunited souls of the two, especially of married partners, a conjunction is effected in a middle love, and that otherwise with men (homines) conceptions would not take place. Besides these things respecting conjugial cold, and relating to the seat of it - that it is in the highest region of the mind - see the last Relation of this chapter, n. <a href="270.htm">270</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #245 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>245. Contra supra confirmata potest fieri objectio, quod usque anima ex patre propagetur, tametsi non conjuncta est animae matris, imo tametsi frigus ibi residens separat; sed quod tamen propagentur animae seu proles, est causa, quia Intellectus viri non occluditur, quin hic elevari possit in lucem, in qua est anima; at amor voluntatis ejus non elevatur in calorem correspondentem luci ibi, nisi per vitam, quae facit illum a naturali spiritualem; inde est, quod usque anima procreetur, sed obveletur in descensu, dum fit semen, per talia quae sunt amoris naturalis ejus; ex hoc scaturit malum haereditarium. His adjiciam arcanum, quod e Coelo est, quod inter Animas disjunctas duorum, imprimis conjugum, fiat conjunctio in medio amore, et quod alioquin apud homines non fierent conceptiones. Praeter haec de frigore conjugiali, et de sede ejus, quod sit in suprema regione mentis, videatur Memorabile ultimum hujus Capitis<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_245/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_270" target=_top>270</a> </p>
