<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>207、对此，我补充两个记事。记事一：<br><br>（第二次造访帕尔纳索斯山之后，见182节）过了一段时间，我朝前面（156a节）所提到的雅典娜城望去，听见那里传来不寻常的喧哗。其中含有一些笑声，笑声中又含有一些愤慨，愤慨中又含有一些悲哀。然而，这种喧哗却没有因此不协调，反而很和谐，因为这几种声音不是同时发出的，而是一种包含在另一种里面。在灵界，人能在声音中分辨出不同情感的混和。我从远处问：“发生什么事？”得到的答复是：“一位使者从来自基督教界新来的人最先出现的地方来了，声称他从那地方新来的三个人那里听说：在他们所来的那个世界，他们和其他人都认为，死后，蒙福和有福的人会停止劳碌，彻底安息。因为职责、职业和工作都是劳碌，所以他们认为自己会停止劳碌，得以安息。这三个人现被我们的使者带来了，正站在门口等候，所以引起一阵喧哗。他们经过深思熟虑，决定不再像以前那样把他们带到帕尔纳索斯山上的帕拉斯神殿，而是把他们带到那里的大礼堂，好公开他们从基督教界带来的新闻，已派出几位代表正式接待他们。”<br><br>我在灵里，对灵来说，距离取决于其情感的状态。因有一种渴望，想亲眼看一看，听一听，于是我便发现自己就在他们面前，看见他们被领进来，听到他们说话。年长的智者坐在礼堂两侧，其余的坐在中间。他们面前有一个高高的讲台，三个新来的人和使者由年轻人带领以庄严的队列穿过礼堂中间，被领到讲台上。一阵沉默过后，在场的一位长者向他们致意，并问道：“你们从地上带来什么新闻？”“新闻有很多”，他们说，“但请告诉我们有关哪方面的？”“关于我们的世界和天堂，地上有什么新闻？”长者答道。他们回答说：“我们初到灵界时，听说无论在这里还是在天堂，都有行政职责、政府部门、公职、商业，各种科学研究和奇妙的手工艺品。我们原以为从尘世移居或搬到灵界后，必进入永恒的安息，不再劳碌，职责不就是劳碌吗？”<br><br>对此，长者说：“难道你们将劳碌之后的永恒安息理解为永远的懒惰，总是坐着或躺着，胸中呼吸快乐的气息，嘴里畅饮喷涌的喜悦吗？”听到这句话，三个新来的人讪笑说，他们原以为是这样。他们被反问：“喜悦、快乐、幸福和懒惰有什么共同点？懒惰会使精神坍塌，而不是抖擞，会叫人变得更死气沉沉，而不是更有活力。想象一下，有人无所事事地坐在那里，双手合十，眼睛垂下或闭上，再想象他同时又被愉快的氛围所包围；他的脑袋和身体岂不昏昏欲睡？他脸上的生动表情岂不脱落？最终，他的每根纤维都会松懈，以致他来回摇晃，栽倒在地。保持整个身体系统张驰有度的，不就是精神的舒展吗？令精神舒展的，不就是使人快乐的行政职责和工作任务吗？所以，我告诉你们天上的一些信息：那里有行政职责，政府部门，上下级法院，以及各种工艺和工作。”<br><br>当三个新来的人听到天上还有上下级法院时，便开始说：“这是为何？凡在天上的人不都受神启示和引领吗？他们怎会不知道何为公义公平？那里还需要法官吗？”长者回答说：“在这个世界，我们被教导和学习何为良善与真理，何为公义与公平，这和尘世是一样的。我们不是直接从神，而是间接从其他人那里学习这些东西。每位天使，就像每个世人一样，都貌似凭自己思考真理，行出良善；这一切取决于天使的状态，所以并不是纯粹的良善与真理，而是掺有瑕疵。另外，天使当中也有简单人和智慧人。当简单人由于简单或无知而质疑或偏离公义时，智者就要做出判断。不过，鉴于你们初来乍到，如果你们愿意随我参观我们的城市，我们会将一切指示给你们。”<br><br>于是，他们离开礼堂，陪同他们的还有一些长者。一行人首先来到一座大图书馆，这个图书馆按照学科领域被分成了众多小图书馆。看到这么多的书，三个新来的人感到很惊讶，说：“这个世界也有书籍？羊皮纸、纸张、笔和墨水是从哪来的？”对此，长者回答说：“我们发觉，你们在世时以为这个世界既然是属灵的，那定是空的。你们如此思想，是因为你们对灵界所持的观念是从物质当中抽象出来的观念，在你们看来，从物质当中抽象出来的东西如同无有，因而如同真空。然而，在这个世界，一切事物都是丰盛的。只是这里的一切事物都实质的（substantial），而不是物质的；物质的事物起源于实质的事物。此处的我们是属灵人，因为我们是实质的，不是物质的。因此，自然界能发现的一切事物，在此都处于自己的完美中，包括书籍、手稿和许多其它事物。”三个新来的人一听到“实质”这个词，便认为必是如此，既因为他们看到所写的的书籍，还因为他们听到说物质起源于实质。为叫他们进一步信服，他们被带到抄写员的住处，这些人正在誊写该城智者所写的草稿。新来的人看到手稿后，惊叹于它们的整洁和优雅。<br><br>之后，他们被带到博物馆、体育馆和学院，以及正在举办文学竞赛的地方。其中有些被称为赫利孔少女竞赛（contests of the Maidens of Helicon），有些被称为帕纳萨斯少女竞赛（contests of the Maidens of Parnassus），有些被称为雅典娜少女竞赛（contests of the Maidens of Athenaeum），有些被称为泉水童女竞赛（contests of the Virgins of the fountain）。他们被告知，之所以如此称谓这些竞赛，是因为少女表示对各类知识的情感，人皆照他对知识的情感而拥有聪明。如此称谓的竞赛是属灵的操练和技能的考验。然后，他们被带到城里，依次拜访了该城的统治者（ruler）、管理者及其职员（managers and their officials）。后者还向他们展示了工匠们以属灵的方式所创作的奇妙作品。<br><br>他们参观完这一切后，长者又和他们谈起劳碌后的永恒安息，就是蒙福和有福的人死后所获得的那种。他说：“永恒的安息不是懒惰，因为那会使精神、因而也使整个身体陷入倦怠、麻木、恍惚、嗜睡的状态。这些状态是死亡，而非生命，更不是天上天使的永生。所以，永恒的安息是消除所有这些病态、使人充满活力的安息。这种安息只能是振奋精神的某种东西，因而是兴奋、活跃和愉悦心灵的某种兴趣或工作。这种兴趣或工作反过来又依赖于某种功用，即是为了功用、在功用中并朝向功用而做的。正因如此，主视整个天堂为功用的容器；每位天使都照其功用而成为天使。功用的快乐载着他，如同水流载着船只，并使他处于永恒的平安和属于平安的安息。这才是劳碌后的永恒安息的意思。天使照其心智出于功用专注于功用而活着。这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：每位天使都照他献身于他所在的纯正功用而享有婚姻之爱及其活力、性能力和快乐。”<br><br>当三个新来的人确信永恒的安息不是懒惰，而是某种有用工作的快乐时，一些少女带着自己亲手制作的女红刺绣来了，并将这些手工艺品赠送给他们。当新灵离开时，少女们唱了一首歌，以天籁之音表达了她们对有用工作及其随之而来的快乐的情感。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>207、现在要做以下两点陈述，首先：</p><p>一段时间后，我朝雅典娜城的方向望去，我在182节中提过，听到一阵喧闹声，其中有种声音听上去像笑声，笑声中带有一种不悦和悲伤，然而这种喧闹却听起十分和谐，因为这些声音并不是相互交织，而是互相融合着。（在精神世界中人们可以清楚地以声音的形式感受到不同的感情）</p><p>我在远处问到：“是怎么回事啊？”</p><p>他们答道：“一个信使从三个来访者所来的地方来，他说他们三个说他们在世间时相信得到祝福的人在死后会不再有劳作。各种职位、责任都属于劳作的一种形式，得到祝福的人将会免于这些劳作。</p><p>“我们的使者将这三人带来了，他们在门口等着呢。一阵骚动后，人们决定不将他们三个带到帕纳谢姆山上。而让他们来到大厅里向人们讲述如今基督教界的信仰。”</p><p>因为我当时处于精神状态，对于精神状态的人来讲距离与他们的情感思想有关，我此时非常想去听听这三个来访者将要说些什么，于是我就出现在他们所在的现场。</p><p>在大厅中，年长的及智者坐在周边，其余的坐在中间。在中间有一个讲台，年轻人将三个来访者和信使带了进来，一个长者问道：“你们从世间带来了什么消息？”</p><p>他们说：“请问你在问哪一方面的消息？”</p><p>长者说：“你们对我们所处的世界及天堂是什么看法？”</p><p>他们答道：“当我们刚到这个地方时我们听说这里以及天堂里有各种职位，商业、学术等方面的工作，但我们在世间时所知的却是在精神世界和天堂中我们将永远安息，不必劳作。”</p><p>听到这些长者说道：“你们是认为永远免于劳作就是永远闲着，坐着或躺着，张着嘴享受快乐吗？”</p><p>三个来访者轻轻地笑着说他们是这样认为的。</p><p>接着他们又听到以下：欢乐与闲着有什么区别呢？永远闲着会使头脑呆滞，会使人走向死亡。想象一下一个人完全闲着，全身困倦，眼睛闭着坐在那一动不动，这样的结果会不会是他最终要垮下去呢？头脑的意愿使得躯体活跃，而头脑的意愿是在不同的职责，活动中形成的。</p><p>“我下面来告诉你天堂中的情况。在这里有不同的职位，有各种律法，有不同的商业活动。”</p><p>当三个来访者听说天国中有各种法律时说道：“天国中的法律有什么意义呢？这里不是由神领导，人们都知道对错吗？这要法官有什么用？”</p><p>年长者回答说：“在这里我们也在学习什么是善的，什么是真的，什么是对的，什么是错误的，这与在世间一样。另外我们不但从神那里学习这些，还同其它人那儿学习这些。每个天使也和人一样，他们懂得真理，做善事，但天使也有区别，有的更明智，有的更简朴些，智者要在简朴者作出不当决定时帮助他们。”</p><p>“因为你们刚到这里，我可以带你们在城中走走，介绍一样情况，于是他们在一些长者的陪同下来到了图书馆。”</p><p>三个来访者吃惊看到了大量的书籍。他们问：“你们的纸是从哪来的？你们的笔和墨水又是从哪来的？”</p><p>长者回答说：“我想你们从前一定是认为我们的世界是精神的世界并且是穷乏的。”你们之所以这样认为是因为精神的事物是脱离物质而存在的。你们认为没有物质就无法存在，可是你看了这里的情况，一切事物都是以精髓状态而存在，而非物质状态。物质状态是来源于精神状态，生活在这里的人是精神状态是因为我们是以精髓的形式而存在，而非以物质形态存在。所以，尘世中的万物在这里都是以完美的形式而存在的。即使是书籍，手稿也是这样的。”</p><p>为了进一步说服三个来访者，这个长者带他们来到复制室，三个来访者看到了那里的手稿都非常的整齐精美。</p><p>之后他们又去了学校，体育场馆，大学及许多举行学术活动的地方。这些学术讲坛被以不同的女子的名字命名。原因是因为少女象征着对各种知识的情感。</p><p>之后他对着带着三个来来访者见了城中各种官员人物以及精神的形式创造出来的工艺品。</p><p>之后长者向他们重新讲起了永远安息的问题。</p><p>“永远的安息并不意味着永远地闲着。因为闲着的状态会带来倦怠、麻木，这是属于死亡的状态。它不是生命的状态，更不是天国中的天使所拥有的永恒的生命。永远的安息，是指避免以上状态，而要激励头脑。因此是各种职业使头脑活跃。主视整个天国为一个有各种有益工作的世界。每个天使都因为他所提供的有益的工作而成为天使。有益的工作带来的快乐就象是一条船给他带来平和的心境。这就是永远安息的意思。</p><p>“天使的生命力与他所从事的有益的工作有关，这可以从他们所拥有的婚姻之爱的力量看得到。”</p><p>当三个来访者确认了永远的安息并非永远闲着而是指从有益的工作中获得快乐后。一些姑娘将手工品送给他们。在他们将要离开时，姑娘们唱起了和谐的歌，歌中传达着有益的工作中所拥有的满足感。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #207 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>207. I shall add here two accounts of experiences, of which this is the first.<p>Some while later I looked towards the city of Athenaeum which I mentioned in a preceding account [<a href="151.htm">151</a>b. (<a href="156.htm">156</a>)]. I heard an unusual shouting coming from it. There was a certain amount of laughter in the shouting, and a certain amount of indignation in the laughter, and a certain amount of sadness in the indignation. Yet this shouting was not for this reason discordant; it was harmonious, because one element was not alongside the other, but one was inside the other. In the spiritual world one can distinguish in sounds the mixture of differing affections.<p>I asked from a distance, 'What is happening?' 'A messenger,' they said, 'has come from the place where newcomers from the Christian parts of the world first appear, to say that he had heard from three people there, that in the world they had come from they shared the belief of other people, that the blessed and happy would after death have total rest from their labours. Since administrative duties, official positions and work are labours, they believed they would have rest from them. The three have now been brought by our emissary, and are standing waiting in front of the gate. So a shout has gone up, and they have deliberated and decided that they should not be brought into the Palladium on Parnassium, as in the previous case, but into the large auditorium, so that they can reveal their news from Christendom. Some people have been despatched to introduce them in due form.'</p><p>[2] I was in the spirit, and distances for spirits depend upon the states of their affections. So then having a desire to see and hear them, so I found myself in their presence, watching them being brought in and hearing what they had to say.<p>The older and wiser people were seated at the sides of the auditorium, and the rest in the middle. There was a raised platform in front of them, and to this the three newcomers, together with the messenger, were conducted by younger men in a solemn procession through the middle of the auditorium. When silence had been obtained, they were greeted by one of the elders present and asked: 'What is the news from earth?' 'There is a lot of news,' they said, 'please tell us on what subject.'<p>'What is the news from earth,' replied the elder, 'about our world and about heaven?' They replied that when recently they had arrived in the spiritual world, they had heard that there and in heaven there are administrative duties, ministries, public offices, businesses, studies in all the sciences and wonderful handicrafts. 'Yet we had believed that after our migration or transfer from the natural world to the spiritual one, we would come into everlasting rest from labours, and what were duties but labours?'</p><p>[3] To this the elder said: 'Did you understand everlasting rest from labours to mean everlasting idleness, in which you would continually sit or lie, plying your hearts with delights and filling your mouth with joys?' The three newcomers smiled gently at this, and said they had supposed something of the sort.<p>'What have joys,' they were asked in reply, 'and delights and the happiness they give got in common with idleness? The result of idleness is that the mind collapses instead of expanding, or one becomes as dead instead of more alive. Imagine someone sitting completely idle, with his hands folded, his eyes cast down or withdrawn, and imagine him at the same time being surrounded with an aura of cheerfulness; would not his head and body be gripped by lassitude, the lively expression of his face would collapse, and eventually his every fibre would become so relaxed that he would sway to and fro until he fell to the ground? What is it that keeps the whole system of the body stretched and under tension but the stretching of the mind? And what is it that stretches the mind but administrative duties and tasks, so long as they are enjoyable? So I will tell you some news from heaven: there are there administrative duties, ministries, higher and lower law-courts, as well as crafts and work.'</p><p>[4] When the three newcomers heard that there were in heaven higher and lower law-courts, they said, 'Why is that? Are not all in heaven inspired and led by God, so that they know what is just and right? What need then is there of judges?'<p>'In this world,' replied the elder, 'we are taught and learn what is good and true, and what is just and fair, in the same way as in the natural world. We do not learn these things directly from God, but indirectly through others. Every angel, just like every man, thinks what is true and does what is good as if of himself, and this, depending upon the angel's state, is not pure truth and good, but mixed. Among angels too there are simple and wise people, and it will be for the wise to judge, when the simple as the result of their simplicity or ignorance are in doubt about what is just or depart from it. But if you, who have not yet been long in this world, would be good enough to accompany me to our city, we shall show you everything.'</p><p>[5] So they left the auditorium, and some of the elders went with them. They came first to a large library, which was divided into smaller collections of books by subjects. The three newcomers were astonished to see so many books, and said, 'Are there books in this world too? Where do they get parchment and paper, pens and ink?'<p>'We perceive,' said the elders, 'that you believed in the previous world that this world is empty, because it is spiritual. The reason for this belief of yours is that you entertained the idea that the spiritual is abstract; and that what is abstract is nothing and so as if empty. Yet here everything is in its fullness. Everything here is substantial, not material; material things owe their origin to what is substantial. We who are present here are spiritual people, because we are substantial, not material. That is why everything that is in the natural world exists here in its perfection; and so are our books and writing, and much more.'<p>When the three newcomers heard the term substantial mentioned, they thought this must be so, both because they saw there were books written and because they had heard it said that matter originated from substances. To give them further proof of this, they were taken to the houses of scribes, who were making copies of books written by the city's wise men. They looked at the writing and were surprised how neat and elegant it was.</p><p>[6] After this they were taken to research institutions, high schools and colleges, and to the places where their literary contests took place. Some of these were called contests of the Maidens of Helicon, some those of the Maidens of Parnassus, some those of the Maidens of Athenaeum, and some those of the Maidens of the Spring-waters. They said that they were so named because maidens stand for the affections for branches of knowledge, and everyone's intelligence depends upon his affection for knowledge. The contests so called were spiritual exercises and gymnastics. Later, they were taken around the city to visit controllers, administrators and their officials, and these showed them the remarkable work performed by craftsmen in a spiritual manner.</p><p>[7] When they had seen this, the elder talked with them again about the everlasting rest from labours the blessed and happy obtain after death. 'Everlasting rest,' he said, 'is not idleness, since that reduces the mind and so the whole body to a state of feebleness, torpidity, stupor and somnolence. These are not life, but death, much less the everlasting life of the angels in heaven. So everlasting rest is a rest that banishes all those ills and makes people alive. This can only be something that uplifts the mind. So it is some interest or task which excites, enlivens and delights the mind. This depends upon the purpose for which, in which and towards which it aims. This is why the whole of heaven is seen by the Lord as one unbroken service, and it is his service that makes every angel an angel. The pleasure of service carries him along, as a favourable current does a ship, and confers upon him everlasting peace and the rest peace gives. This is what is meant by everlasting rest from labours. The extent to which an angel is alive depends upon his mental commitment arising from service. This is perfectly clear from the fact that the depth of conjugial love anyone enjoys, together with manliness, potency and the delights that accompany it, depend upon his commitment to true service.'</p><p>[8] When it had been proved to the three newcomers that everlasting rest is not idleness, but the pleasure of some work that is of service, some young women came with embroidery and sewing, their own handiwork, and presented these to them. Then, as the new spirits took their departure, the young women sang a song expressing in an angelic melody their affection for useful work and its attendant pleasures. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #207 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>207. To this I will append two narrative accounts. Here is the first:<p>Some time later <sup >1</sup>I looked in the direction of the city Athenaeum, which I said something about in an earlier account, <sup >2</sup>and I heard an unusual clamor. In the clamor I heard an element of laughter, in the laughter an element of displeasure, and in the displeasure an element of sorrow. However, the clamor was not therefore inharmonious, but harmonious, because the elements did not mix with each other, but one was contained within another. (In the spiritual world, one distinctly perceives the variety and combination of affections in a sound.)<p>From a distance I asked, "What is the matter?"<p>They then said, "A messenger came from the place where newcomers from the Christian world first appear, saying he had heard from three of them there that in the world they had come from, they had believed like everyone else that the blessed and happy after death would have complete rest from their labors, and that since positions of responsibility, occupations and employments are labors, they would have rest from these.<p>"An emissary of ours has now brought these three here, and they are standing at the gate and waiting. A commotion broke out because of this, and after deliberating, the people have decided not to bring them into the Palladium on Parnassium hill, as they have done with visitors before, but to bring them into the great hall there, to disclose the news they have from the Christian world. Several delegates have been sent to formally usher them in."</p><p>[2] Since I was in the spirit - and since distances for spirits depend on the states of their affections, and I was then affected with a wish to see and hear these people - I found myself present there and saw them brought in and heard them speak.<p>The people in the hall who were older or wiser sat towards the sides, with the rest in the middle, and in front of them was a raised dais. In formal procession through the middle of the hall, some of the younger people conducted the three newcomers and the messenger to it. Then, after waiting for silence, one of the older ones there greeted them and asked, "What news do you have from earth?"<p>They said, "We have much that is new, but tell us, please, on what subject?"<p>So the older man replied, "What news do you have from earth regarding our world and heaven?"<p>They then answered, "When we first came into this world, we learned that here and in heaven there are positions of responsibility, ministries, occupations, business dealings, scholarly studies in every field of learning, and wonderful kinds of employment. Yet we had believed that upon our departure or passage from the natural world into this spiritual one, we would come into everlasting rest from our labors. What are occupations but labors?"</p><p>[3] To this the older man replied, "Did you think that eternal rest from labors meant eternal idleness, in which you would continually sit around or lie about, breathing in auras of delight with your breast and drinking in outpourings of joy with your mouth?"<p>Laughing gently at this, the three newcomers said that they had supposed something of the sort.<p>At that they then received this response: "What do joys and delights and thus happiness have in common with idleness? Idleness causes the mind to collapse rather than expand, or the person to become deader rather than more alive.<p>"Picture someone sitting around in a state of complete idleness, with hands hanging down, his eyes downcast or shut, and imagine that he is at the same time surrounded with an aura of rapture. Would drowsiness not seize both his head and his body, and the lively swelling of his face drop? With every fiber loosened, would he not finally begin to sway back and forth and eventually fall to the ground? What keeps the whole system of the body expanded and taut but an intentness of mind? And what produces an intentness of mind but responsibilities and employments, when these are undertaken with delight?<p>"So, then, I will tell you some news from heaven, that they have there positions of responsibility, ministries, higher and lower courts of law, and also trades and employments."</p><p>[4] When the three newcomers heard that in heaven they have higher and lower courts of law, they began to say, "What is the purpose of these? Are not all in heaven inspired and led by God, and do they not all therefore know what is just and right? What need is there then for judges?"<p>But the older man replied, "In this world we are instructed and taught what is good and true, also what is just and right, the same as in the natural world. Moreover, we learn these things not directly from God but indirectly through others. Every angel, too, like every man, thinks truth and does good as though of himself, and this is not pure but mixed in character, depending on the angel's state. In addition, among angels also, some are simple and some wise, and the wise have to make judgments when the simple ones among them, owing to their simpleness or ignorance, are uncertain about what is just or deviate from it.<p>"But," he said to them, "since you are still newcomers in this world, follow me into our city, if you wish, and we will show you all."</p><p>[5] So they left the hall, with some of the older people accompanying them as well. And they went first to a great library, which had been divided into a number of smaller collections according to subject fields.<p>The three newcomers were dumbfounded at seeing so many books, and they said, "You have books in this world too! Where do you get the parchment and paper? Where you get the pens and ink?"<p>The older men said in reply, "We perceive that you believed in the previous world that because this world is spiritual, it would be barren. Moreover, that you believed this because you harbored an idea of spiritual existence that was abstracted from a material one, and anything abstracted from material existence seemed to you to be nothing, consequently as something barren. Yet we have a full array of everything here. It is just that everything here is essential in nature rather than material, and material objects take their origin from essential ones. Those of us who live here are spiritual beings because we are essential beings rather than material ones. So it is that everything found in the material world exists here in its perfect form, even books and manuscripts, and many other things."<p>When the three newcomers heard the term essential used, they thought it must be so, both because they saw the books that had been written, and because they had heard it said that material objects have their origin from essential forms.<p>To convince them further with respect to this, the men took the newcomers down to the quarters of copyists who were making copies of drafts written by some of the wise people of the city; and when the newcomers looked at the manuscripts, they marveled at how neat and polished they were.</p><p>[6] After this they escorted the newcomers to professional academies, gymnasia and colleges, also to places where their scholarly forums were held, some of which they called forums of the Daughters of Heliconeum, some forums of the Daughters of Parnassium, some forums of the Daughters of Athenaeum, and some forums of the Muses of the Spring. <sup >3</sup>They said they gave them these names because daughters or maidens symbolize affections for various kinds of knowledge, and everyone's intelligence depends on his affection for various kinds of knowledge. The forums so called were spiritual exercises and debates.<p>Next they took the newcomers around the city to its directors and managers and their officials, and these in turn introduced them to marvelous works, which their craftsmen create in a spiritual manner.</p><p>[7] After the newcomers had seen these things, the older man spoke with them again concerning eternal rest from labors, into which the blessed and happy come after death.<p>"Eternal rest does not mean idleness," he said, "because idleness affects the mind and consequently the whole body with listlessness, lethargy, insensibility and slumber, and these are conditions of deadness, not life, much less the eternal life experienced by angels of heaven. Eternal rest, therefore, is rest that dispels these states and vitalizes a person, and this must be something which rouses the mind. Thus it is some pursuit or employment by which the mind is awakened, animated, and afforded delight, which in turn depends on some useful service for the sake of which, in which, and towards which it is working. So it is that the whole of heaven is viewed by the Lord as a world of useful service, and each angel is an angel according to the service he renders. The pleasure in being useful carries him along, like a boat in a favoring current, bringing him into a state of eternal peace and the rest that comes with peace. This is what is meant by eternal rest from labors.<p>"An angel's vitality depends on an application of his mind to some pursuit for the sake of being useful, and confirmation of this is clearly seen from the fact that they each possess conjugial love with its vigor, potency and delights in the measure that they are engaged in a pursuit of genuine use."</p><p>[8] When the three newcomers had been convinced that eternal rest does not mean idleness but the pleasure in some employment that is of use, some young women came with articles of needlework and sewing, works of their own hands, which they presented to them. Then, as these newly introduced spirits were departing, the young women sang a song whose angelic melody expressed an affection for employments of use and its accompanying satisfactions.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e., some time after the occurrence related in no. <a href="182.htm">182</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;See no. <a href="182.htm">182</a>; also nos. <a href="156.htm">151[r]-154[r]</a><p>3.&nbsp;In reference to these names, cf., in previous accounts of this city, the topographical features mentioned in nos. <a href="156.htm">151[r]:1</a>, <a href="182.htm">182:1</a>, <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #207 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>207. I'll add to these remarks two stories. This is the first:<p>At a later time I looked toward the city of Athens, mentioned in earlier stories, and I heard an unusual clamor coming from it.<p>There was an element of laughter in it and in the laughter an element of indignation, and in the indignation an element of grief.<p>Yet that did not make the noises dissonant, but consonant, because one sound was not at the same time as another. They came one after another. In the spiritual world you distinctly notice varieties and mixtures of feelings in sound.<p>I asked from a distance, "What's the matter?"<p>They said, "A messenger came from the place where arrivals from the Christian world first show up, saying that he heard from three of them there that in the world they came from, they and others believed that the blessings and happiness after death would be total rest from labors, and that the blessings would be rest from management, duties, and jobs, because these are labors.<p>"Our messenger has now brought the three here, and they stand waiting outside the gate, so a clamor went up. And on consideration they decided not to bring them into the Palladium on Parnassus as before, but into the great auditorium there, so they can break the news they have from the Christian world.<p>Some people were appointed to introduce them properly."<p>I was in spirit, and distances for spirits are according to their feelings. I felt like seeing and hearing them, so I found myself present there, and I saw them introduced and heard them speaking.<p>The elders or wiser ones were seated at the sides of the auditorium, and the rest were in the middle. A raised platform was in front of them. To this the younger men brought the three newcomers, with the messenger, with due ceremony, through the center of the auditorium. And once it quieted down one of the elders there greeted them and asked, "What is new from Earth?"<p>They said, "Much is new, but please name a subject."<p>The elder said, "What is new from Earth about our world and heaven?"<p>They answered, "When we new spirits came into this world we heard that here and in heaven there's management, administration, duties, business, studies in all disciplines, and wonderful craftsmen.<p>And yet we thought that after passing over, or being carried across, from the natural world into this spiritual one we would come into eternal rest from work. And what are duties but work?"<p>To this the elder said, "By 'eternal rest from work' did you understand eternal leisure, where you would continually sit and lie down, gathering delights in your breast and drinking in pleasures with your mouth?"<p>To this the three newcomers laughed politely and said that they had supposed something like that.<p>The answer to that was, "What do pleasures and delights and the happiness from them have to do with inactivity? Idleness collapses your mind - it doesn't open your mind up. In other words, it makes a person dead, not alive. Picture someone sitting in complete idleness, hands hanging down, eyes downcast or staring, and picture him surrounded with pleasures at the time.<p>Wouldn't his head and body both get drowsy, and wouldn't the lively smile on his face droop? And with every fiber relaxed, wouldn't he nod and sway until he fell on the ground? What loosens and tones up all the parts of your body like a focused mind? And where does mental focus come from unless it comes from management and jobs, when they are done from delight?<p>"So I'll tell you the news from heaven. There's management, administration, higher and lower courts there, and there are also trades and employment."<p>When the three newcomers heard that there are higher and lower courts in heaven, they said, "Why is that? Isn't everyone in heaven inspired and led by God? Don't they know what's just and right from that? What do the courts do?"<p>The elder man answered, "In this world we are taught and learn about what is good and true and also what is just and fair, the same as in the natural world. We don't learn this directly from God, but indirectly through others. And every angel, like every person, thinks truth and does good as if by himself. It is mixed and impure according to the angel's condition.<p>"And also some angels are plain and some are wise, and the wise ones have to judge, when the plain ones, in their simplicity and ignorance, are undecided about what is just, or wander away from it.<p>"But since you have just come into this world, if you feel like it, follow me into our city, and we'll show you everything."<p>They left the auditorium, and some of the elders also went with them.<p>First they went to the great Library, which was divided into smaller libraries according to fields of knowledge. When they saw so many books, the three newcomers were astonished and said, "Are there books in this world, too? Where do you get parchment and paper? Where do you get pens and ink?"<p>The elders answered this. "We notice that in the former world you thought that this world was empty because it is spiritual.<p>You thought so because you cherished a notion of spirit without matter, and without matter it seemed like nothing to you, thus like a vacuum, when instead everything is complete here. Everything here is substantial and not material. Material things come from substantial things. We who are here are spiritual people, because we are substantial, not material. This is why all the things in the natural world are here in their perfection - even books and literature and many other things."<p>When the three newcomers heard the things called "substantial," they thought it must be so, both because they saw the written books and because they heard the statement that substance is the source of matter.<p>To further assure them about these things they were taken to where the scribes lived who were making copies of books by the city's wise men. They inspected the writing and were surprised that it was so neat and refined.<p>After this they were led to museums, schools, and colleges, and to where those people's literary contests were. Some were called games of the Heliconians, others games of the Parnassians, others games of the Athenians, and others games of the Virgins of the Spring. They said that these last were called this because virgins stand for affections having to do with knowing things, and a person has intelligence according to his affection for knowing things. The games called this were spiritual exercises and trials of skill.<p>Later they were led around in the city to rulers, administrators, and their officers, and by them to wonderful structures that were made in a spiritual way by tradesmen.<p>After they saw these things the elder spoke with them again about the eternal rest from work that the blessed and happy enter after death, and he said, "Eternal rest is not idleness, because from idleness the mind, and from the mind the whole body, gets weariness, numbness, lethargy, and sleepiness, and these are death, not life, and still less are they the eternal life that angels of heaven live. So eternal rest is rest that dispels those things and makes the person live, and this must be something that lifts your mind. So it is some study and work that excites, enlivens, and pleases your mind.<p>This happens in pursuit of some usefulness that you work for, on, and at. For this reason the entire heaven as the Lord sees it is one continuous activity, and every angel is an angel according to participation.<p>The joy of usefulness carries him the way a following current does a ship, and it puts him in eternal peace and the rest that peace brings. This is what eternal rest from work means.<p>"The fact that an angel is alive according to how eagerly he applies his mind because he is occupied shows clearly in the fact that everyone has married love with its strength, potency, and joy, according to how he applies himself to his real calling."<p>Then the three newcomers were convinced that eternal rest is not idleness but the joy of some work that is useful. Some young women came with needlepoint and sewing, their handwork, and gave it to the newcomers. And the young women sang a song with an angelic tune as the new spirits went away. The song expressed the feeling of doing useful things, and its pleasures. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #207 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>207. To the above, I will add two Memorable Relations. First: Some time after [the second visit to Parnassus (no. <a href="182.htm">182</a>)], I looked towards the city Athens, of which something was said in a former Relation (no. Conjugial Love 156), and heard thence an unusual clamor. There was something of laughter in it, in this something of indignation, and in this something of sadness; yet the clamor was not therefore dissonant but harmonious, because the one sound was not simultaneous with the other but the one was within the other. In the spiritual world, the variety and commingling of affections in sound are distinctly perceived.<p>While still at some distance, I asked what it meant, and received the answer: "A messenger has come from the place where new-comers from the Christian world first appear, saying that he had heard from three new-comers there, that in the world whence they came, they with others had believed that after death the blessed and happy would have entire rest from labors; and since administrations, offices, and employments are labors, that they would have rest from these. Clamor was made because the three have now been conducted hither by our emissary and are standing at the gate waiting. It has been decreed in council that for the purpose of disclosing their news from the Christian world, they were to be introduced, not into the Palladium on Parnassus like the previous new-comers, but into the great auditorium there; and some delegates have been sent to introduce them formally."</p><p>[2] Because I was in the spirit, and with spirits distances are according to the states of their affections; and because my affection was then moved to see and hear these new-comers, I seemed to myself to be present in the auditorium. There I saw the new-comers introduced and heard them speak. The seniors or wiser men were seated at the sides, the rest being in the middle. In front of the latter was a raised platform. Thither, in formal procession through the middle of the auditorium, the three new-comers and the herald were conducted by some younger men; and when silence had been obtained and they had been greeted by one of the elders, the new-comers, being asked, "What news from earth?" answered, "There is much news, but tell us, pray, on what subject?" When the elder replied, "What is the news from earth respecting our world and respecting heaven," they answered: "On first coming into this world, we heard that here and in heaven there were administrations, ministries, employments, businesses, studies in all kinds of learning, and wonderful handicrafts; and yet we had thought that after removal or transition from the natural world to this spiritual world, we should come into eternal rest from labors; and what are employments but labors?"</p><p>[3] To this the elder replied: "By eternal rest from labors, did you mean eternal idleness in which you would be continually sitting and lying down, inhaling delights into your breasts and drinking in joys with your mouth?" Smiling blandly, the three new-comers said that they had supposed something of the kind.<p>Answer was then given them: "What have joys and delights and the happiness therefrom in common with idleness? By idleness the mind becomes, not expanded, but collapsed, that is, a man is not enlivened but deadened. Picture a man sitting in complete idleness, hands hanging down, eyes withdrawn; and suppose that at the same time he is surrounded by an aura of gladness; would not drowsiness take possession of his head and body? Would not the living expansion of his face fall away? and at last, with fiber relaxed, would he not nod again and again until he fell to the ground? What keeps the whole bodily system expanded and tense but intentness of mind? and whence comes intentness of mind but from administrations and occupations when done from delight? Let me, therefore, tell you something new from heaven: There are administrations and ministries there, and courts of justice, higher and lower, and also mechanical arts and handicrafts."</p><p>[4] When the three new-comers heard that there were higher and lower courts of justice in heaven, they said: "Why these; are not all in heaven inspired and led of God, and so, do they not know what is just and right? What need then of judges?" The presiding elder replied: "In this world we are taught what is good and true and what is just and equitable, and we learn this just as in the natural world, learning it, not immediately from God, but mediately through others. Every angel, like every man, thinks truth and does good as of himself; and this good is not pure but mixed, according to the state of the angel. Moreover, among angels there are the simple and the wise; and when, from simplicity and ignorance, the simple are in doubt as to what is just, or when they swerve from it, the wise must give judgment. But since you have newly come into this world, follow me into our city, if that is your pleasure, and we will show you everything."</p><p>[5] They then left the auditorium, some of the elders accompanying them. They went first into a large library which was divided into smaller libraries according to the sciences. The three new-comers were amazed at seeing so many books, and said, "Are there also books in this world? Where do the parchment and paper come from? and the pens and ink?"<p>To this the elders replied: "We perceive that in the former world you thought that this world was empty because spiritual; and that you so thought because the idea you entertained concerning the spiritual world was an idea abstracted from what is material, and to you, what is abstracted from the material appeared as nothing and thus as a vacuum. Yet in this world is a plenitude of all things. Here all things are SUBSTANTIAL not material; and material things derive their origin from things substantial. We who are here are spiritual men because substantial and not material. Hence all things which are found in the natural world are here in their perfection, even books and writings and much else."<p>When the three new-comers heard them called SUBSTANTIAL, they thought that they were substantial, and this both because they saw the written books and because they heard the statement that matter originated from substances. That they might be still further confirmed, they were taken to the dwellings of scribes who were making copies of the writings of the wise men of the city; and they inspected the writings and admired their neatness and elegance.</p><p>[6] After this they were conducted to museums, gymnasiums and colleges, and to places where literary sports were being held. Some of these were called sports of the Heliconians, some sports of the Parnassians, some sports of the Athenians, and some sports of the Virgins of the Fountain. They were told that these latter were so called because virgins signify affections for the sciences, and every one has intelligence according to his affection for the sciences. The so-called sports were spiritual exercises and trials of skill. They were then taken around the city to its rulers and administrators and their subordinate officials; and by the latter they were shown the marvelous productions wrought by artisans in a spiritual manner.</p><p>[7] After they had seen all this, the presiding elder, again addressing them on the subject of the eternal rest from labor into which the blessed and happy come after death, said: "Eternal rest is not idleness, for from idleness come languor, torpidity, stupor and drowsiness of the mind and so of the whole body. These are death not life, still less the eternal life in which are the angels of heaven. Eternal rest, therefore, is a rest which dispels them and makes a man live. Such rest can be nothing else than something which elevates the mind, and therefore some study and work whereby the mind is aroused, vivified and delighted, being thus affected according to the use from which, in which, and for which the work is done. Hence it is that the whole of heaven is regarded by the Lord as a containant of uses, and every angel is an angel according to his use. The delight of use carries him along as a favoring current carries a ship, and causes him to be in eternal peace and in the rest that belongs to peace. This is what is meant by eternal rest from labors. That an angel is living, according to the devotion of his mind [to use] from use, is clearly manifest from the fact that every angel has conjugial love, with its virtue, its potency, and its delights, according to his devotion to the genuine use in which he is."</p><p>[8] When the three new-comers had been convinced that eternal rest is not idleness but the delight of some work which is of use, there came some virgins with pieces of embroidery and netting, the work of their own hands. These they gave them; and when the novitiates were leaving, these virgins sang an ode wherein, in an angelic melody, they expressed the affection for works of use together with the pleasantness thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #207 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>207. I add two Memorabilia.<p>I. Some time later <sup >1</sup>I was looking toward the city of Athens, of which there was mention in earlier Memorabilia, and heard a queer clamor thence. I heard laughter, and in this some indignation, and in this again some sadness. Yet the outcry was not discordant, but harmonious, because one element did not accompany the other but was within it. In the spiritual world the various affections commingled in sound are severally perceived.<p>At a distance still, I asked, "What is the matter?" They said:<p>"A messenger has come from the place where newcomers from Christendom first arrive, saying that he heard from three of them there that in the world they had believed with others that the blessed and happy after death would enjoy absolute rest from labor; and, as administrations, offices and employments are labor, they would enjoy rest from these.<p>"The three newcomers have been brought here by our a conference it was decided to show them, not like the earlier newcomers into the palladium on Parnassus, but into the great auditorium there, to tell their news from the Christian world. Men have been deputed to introduce them properly."</p><p>[2] As I was in the spirit, and with spirits distances are according to the states of their affections, and as I then had an affection for seeing and hearing the newcomers, I seemed to myself present there, and saw them introduced, and heard them speak. The older or wiser men were seated at the sides of the auditorium, the rest in the middle; at the front was a raised platform. To this platform, up through the middle of the auditorium, some young men ceremoniously conducted the three strangers with the messenger. When silence had been obtained, they were greeted by one of the elders, who asked:<p>"What news from the earth?"<p>They answered, "There is much news. But tell us, please, on what subject?"<p>The elder replied, "What news is there from the earth about our world and about heaven?"<p>They answered, "On first coming into this world we heard that here and in heaven there are administrations, ministries, employments, business, all kinds of learned studies, and amazing handicraft. We had supposed, however, that on removal or transition from the natural world to this spiritual world we should enter into eternal rest from labor; but what are employments if not labor?"</p><p>[3] To this the elder replied, "By eternal rest from labor, you did not understand, did you, eternal idleness, in which you would continually be sitting or lying down, inhaling delights into your bosoms, and drinking in joys with the mouth?" Smiling complacently, the three strangers said that they had supposed something of the kind. Then answer was made them:<p>"What have joys and delights and happiness therefrom in common with idleness? In idleness the mind collapses instead of being extended, and a man is deadened, and not quickened. Imagine a person sitting in complete idleness, hands limp, eyes closed and dreaming, and suppose him enveloped at the same time by an agreeable atmosphere, would not lethargy seize head and body? Would not the face lose its lifelike look? And at length, with fibers relaxed, would the man not fall to nodding until he sank to the earth? What keeps the whole bodily system expanded and taut but intentness of mind? And whence comes intentness of mind but from administrations and work, when done with delight? Let me therefore give you news from heaven! There are administrations there, ministries, higher and lower courts of justice, and also trades and handicrafts."</p><p>[4] On hearing that there are higher and lower courts of justice in heaven, the three newcomers said, "Why should there be courts there? Are not all in heaven inspired and led of God? Do they not therefore know what is just and right? What need is there then of judges?"<p>The elder replied, "We have to be instructed and must learn what is good and true, just and equitable, in this world as in the natural world. We do not learn directly from God but mediately through others. Every angel, like every man, thinks truth and does good as of himself, and his thought and action are more or less pure according to his state. Among angels there are also simple and wise, and the wise must judge, when the simple in their simplicity or ignorance are in doubt about what is just or depart from it. But you are new to this world; if it meets your pleasure, come with me into our city, and we will show you everything."</p><p>[5] They left the auditorium, accompanied by some of the elders. They first visited a great library, subdivided into smaller libraries according to the different branches of knowledge. The three newcomers, seeing so many books, were astounded and exclaimed:<p>"Books, too, in this world! Whence have you parchment and paper? And pen and ink?"<p>To this the elders replied, "We perceive that in the former world you believed that this world, being spiritual, is empty. You believed so because you thought of the spiritual as abstract from the material, and regarded what is abstract from the material as nothing and thus empty. In truth, here is a fullness of all things. Every thing here is substantial, not material; the material takes its origin from the substantial. We ourselves are spiritual men, being substantial and not material. Hence all things to be found in the natural world are to be found here in perfection, even books and manuscripts and much else."<p>When the three newcomers heard the substantial so spoken of, they began to think it must be so; they saw the written books before them and they had heard the statement that material things originate from things substantial. For further assurance, they were taken to the<p>Houses of scribes who were making copies of works composed by wise men of the city. They inspected the writing and admired its neatness and elegance.</p><p>[6] After this they were conducted to museums, schools and colleges; and to places where literary sports were held. Some of these sports were called sports of the Heliconians; others, sports of the Parnassians, or of the Athenians, or of the Virgins of the Fountain. These last sports, they were told, are so named because virgins signify the affections of knowledges; according to these affections one has intelligence. These so-called sports are spiritual exercises and trials of skill. Later they were conducted about the city to the rulers and administrators and their subordinates, who showed them wonderful productions wrought in the spiritual manner by artisans.</p><p>[7] After they had seen all these things, the elder spoke with them again about the eternal rest from labor into which the blessed and happy enter after death. He told them:<p>"Eternal rest is not inactivity. From inactivity come only languor, torpidity, stupor, and drowsiness of the mind and thence of the whole body. These are death, not life, still less the eternal life in which the angels of heaven are. Eternal rest is of a kind to dispel languor and drowsiness, and quicken men; it must be something which uplifts the mind. It is in some study or work that the mind is aroused, enlivened and delighted; and this takes place according to the use from, in, and toward which it is working. Hence all heaven in the Lord's sight is a theater of uses; every angel is an angel according to his use. His pleasure in his use bears an angel along as a favoring current does a ship. It causes him to be in eternal peace, and in the rest of peace. This is what is meant by eternal rest from labor. That an angel is alive according to the zeal of his mind in a use, is attested by the fact that every angel has marital love, with its vigor, potency and delights, according to the zeal with which he pursues the genuine use in which he is."</p><p>[8] When the three strangers felt well assured that eternal rest is not idleness, but joy in doing some useful work, some young women came and presented them with articles they had spun and embroidered with their own hands. And as the novitiate spirits departed the young women sang an ode, in which they expressed in angelic melody the affection for useful work with its pleasures.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;These Memorabilia occur again in <a href="../tcr/694.htm">True Christian Religion 694</a>. </p>

That they might be still further assured, they were taken to the dwellings of the scribes who were making copies of the original writings of the wise men of the city. And they inspected the writings and admired their neatness and elegance. After this they were conducted to museums, gymnasiums, and colleges; and to where their literary sports were held. Some of these were called sports of the Heliconians; some, sports of the Parnassians; some, of the Atheneids; and some, sports of the Virgins of the Fountain.

It is therefore, some study and work by which the mind is aroused, vivified, and delighted; and this is effected according to the use from which, in which, and for which it is working. Hence it is that the whole heaven is seen by the Lord as containing uses, and every angel is an angel according to his use. The enjoyment of use carries him along as a favoring current does a ship, and causes him to be in eternal peace, and in the rest of peace. This is meant by eternal rest from labors. That an angel is alive according to the eagerness of his mind from use, is very plain from the fact that every angel has conjugial love, with its virtue, its potency, and its delights, according to his eager application to the genuine use in which he is.'<p>When the three strangers were well assured that eternal rest is not idleness, but the enjoyment of some work that is of use, a number of virgins came with pieces of embroidery and netting, the work of their own hands, and gave these to them.

<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #207 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>207. His adjiciam Duo Memorabilia; Primum hoc. Post aliquod tempus spectavi ad urbem Athenaeum, de qua in priori Memorabili aliquid dictum est; et audivi inde clamorem insolitum; erat in illo aliquid risus, in hoc aliquid indignationis, et in hac aliquid maestitiae; at usque clamor ille non inde erat dissonus, sed consonus, quia unum non erat simul cum altero, sed unum intra alterum; in Mundo spirituali percipitur in sono distincte varietas et commixtura affectionum. Quaesivi e longinquo, "quid rei;" et dixerunt, "venit nuntius e loco, ubi advenae e Christiano Orbe primum apparent, dicens, quod a tribus ibi audiverit, quod in Mundo, unde venerunt, cum reliquis ibi crediderint, quod beatis et felicibus post mortem futura sit omnimoda requies a laboribus; et quia administrationes, officia et operae sunt labores, quod requies ab illis futura sit: et quia tres illi ab Emissario nostro nunc adducti sunt, et stant ante portam et exspectant, factus est Clamor, et ex consulto statuerunt, quod non in Palladium in Parnassio, ut priores, sed in magnum Auditorium ibi introducerentur, ut aperiant Nova sua e Christiano Orbe; et ablegati sunt aliqui, qui solenniter illos introducerent."</p><p>[2] Quia eram in spiritu, et spiritibus distantiae sunt secundum status affectionum illorum; et quia tunc mihi affectio videndi et audiendi illos erat, visus mihi sum praesens ibi, et vidi introductos, et audivi loquentes. Sederunt in Auditorio Seniores seu Sapientiores ad latera, ac reliqui in medio; et ante hos erat elevatum solum; huc tres Advenae cum nuntio in solenni comitatu a minorennibus per medium Auditorii traducti sunt; et post silentium factum, salutati sunt a quodam Majorenni ibi, et quaesiti, quid Novi e terra; et dixerunt, "sunt multa Nova, sed dic quaeso de qua re;" et respondit Majorennis, quid Novi e terra de nostro Mundo et de Coelo; et responderunt, quod cum recentes in hunc Mundum venimus, audiverimus, quod ibi et in Coelo sint Administrationes, Ministeria, Functiones, Negotiationes, Studia omnium disciplinarum, et mirabiles Operae; "et tamen credidimus quod post migrationem seu translationem e Mundo naturali in hunc Spiritualem, in aeternam requiem a laboribus venturi simus; et quid functiones nisi labores:"</p><p>[3] ad haec Majorennis dixit, "num per aeternam requiem a laboribus intellexistis aeternum otium, in quo continue sederetis et cubaretis, attrahentes delitias pectore, et sorbentes gaudia ore;" ad haec tres Advenae blande ridentes dixerunt, quod aliquid tale autumaverint; et tunc responsum est illis, "quid gaudia, et delitiae, et inde felicitas, commune habent cum otio; ex otio collabitur mens et non expanditur, seu mortificatur homo et non vivificatur; pone aliquem sedentem in pleno otio, remissis manibus, dejectis aut subductis oculis, et pone ut ille simul circumfundatur aura laetitiae; numne Veternus occuparet et caput et corpus ejus, ac vitalis expansio faciei concideret, et tandem ille relaxatis fibris nutaret et nutaret, usque dum caderet in terram; quid in expansione et tensione tenet totius corporis systema, quam intensio animi; et unde intensio animi, nisi ex administraturis et operis, dum fiunt ex jucundo: quare dicam vobis Novum e Coelo, quod ibi sint administrationes, ministeria, judicia majora et minora, tum artificia et operae."</p><p>[4] Tres advenae, cum audiverunt, quod in Coelo essent Judicia majora et minora, dicebant, "cur illa; annon omnes in Coelo inspirantur et ducuntur a Deo, et inde sciunt quid justum et rectum; quid tunc opus judicibus;" et respondit Vir majorennis, "in hoc Mundo instruimur et discimus quid bonum et verum, tum quid justum et aequum, similiter ut in Mundo naturali, et haec discimus non immediate a Deo, sed mediate per alios; et omnis Angelus, sicut omnis homo, cogitat verum, et facit bonum sicut a se, et hoc secundum statum Angeli est mixtum, et non purum; et quoque inter Angelos dantur simplices et sapientes, et sapientes judicabunt, dum simplices ex simplicitate et ex ignorantia ambigunt de justo, aut abeunt ab illo. Sed vos, quia recentes adhuc in hoc Mundo estis, si sit beneplaciti vestri, sequimini me in Urbem nostram, et monstrabimus omnia;"</p><p>[5] et exiverunt Auditorio, et aliqui ex Senioribus etiam illos comitati sunt; et primum in Bibliothecam magnam, quae secundum scientias distincta erat in Libraria minora: tres illi Advenae, visis tot libris, obstupefacti sunt, et dixerunt, "sunt etiam in hoc Mundo Libri; unde membranae et chartae, unde calami et atramentum;" ad haec dixerunt Seniores, "percipimus quod credideritis in Mundo priori, quod hic Mundus vacuus sit, quia spiritualis; et quod hoc credideritis, est quia ideam de spirituali fovistis abstractam a materiali; et abstractum a materiali apparuit vobis sicut nihilum, ita sicut vacuum; cum tamen hic est plenitudo omnium; sunt hic omnia Substantialia et non materialia, et materialia suam originem ducunt ex substantialibus; nos qui hic sumus, homines spirituales sumus quia substantiales, et non materiales; inde est, quod hic dentur omnia quae in Mundo naturali in sua perfectione, etiam libri et scripturae, et multo plura;" tres Advenae cum audiverunt nominari Substantialia, cogitaverunt quod ita sit, tam quia viderunt Libros scriptos, quam quia audiverunt dictum, quod materiae originitus sint ex substantiis. Ut adhuc de his confirmarentur, delati sunt ad domicilia scribarum, qui exscribebant exemplaria a sapientibus urbis conscripta, et inspiciebant scripturas, et mirati sunt, quod tam nitidae et politae essent.</p><p>[6] Post haec deducti sunt ad Musaea, Gymnasia et Collegia, et ubi erant Ludi illorum literarii, quorum aliquos vocabant Heliconidum, aliquos ludos Parnassidum, aliquos ludos Atheneidum, et aliquos ludos Virginum fontis; dicebant quod hi ita appellentur, quia Virgines significant affectiones scientiarum, et secundum affectionem scientiarum est cuivis intelligentia; Ludi ita vocati, erant exercitationes et palaestrae <sup>1</sup>spirituales. Postea circumducti sunt in urbe ad Moderatores, Administratores, et horum Officiarios, et per hos ad mirabiles Operas, quae ab artificibus spirituali modo fiunt.</p><p>[7] Postquam haec visa sunt, iterum cum illis loquutus est Vir majorennis de Requie aeterna a laboribus, in quam veniunt beati et felices post mortem, et dixit, "Requies aeterna non est otium, quoniam ex otio est mentis, et inde totius corporis, languor, torpor, stupor et sopor, et haec sunt mors et non vita et minus vita aeterna, in qua sunt Angeli Coeli; quare requies aeterna est requies quae discutit illa, et facit ut homo vivat; et hoc non aliud est, quam tale quod elevat mentem; est itaque aliquod studium et opus, ex quo excitatur, vivificatur, et delitiatur mens; et hoc fit secundum usum, ex quo, in quo, et ad quem operatur; inde est, quod Universum Coelum spectetur a Domino ut continens usus, et quisque Angelus est Angelus secundum usum; jucundum usus fert illum sicut secunda vena navem, et facit ut in aeterna pace, et pacis requie sit; ita intelligitur Aeterna requies a laboribus. Quod Angelus sit vivus secundum studium mentis ex usu, patet manifeste ex eo, quod cuivis sit Amor conjugialis cum ejus virtute, potentia et delitiis, secundum studium genuini usus in quo est."</p><p>[8] Postquam tres illi Advenae confirmati sunt, quod Aeterna requies non sit otium, sed jucundum alicujus operis quod usui est, <sup>2</sup>venerunt aliquae Virgines cum acupictis et netis, operibus manuum suarum, et donaverunt illis; et Virgines, cum abibant novitii illi spiritus, cecinerunt oden, qua affectionem operum usus cum amaenis ejus, melo angelico exprimebant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: palaestriae<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: est; </p>
