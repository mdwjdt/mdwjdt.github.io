<h4 align="center"></h4><p>181、(22)这些若不是在一个男人和一个妻子的婚姻中，是绝无可能存在的。这一点作为一个结论从前面所述可推知；它也是从后面所说一切得出的结论，故没有必要通过专门讨论来证明这一点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>181、（22）这些祝福只有在一夫一妻的婚姻中才是可能的，这点可以以上归纳得出。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #181 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>181. (xxii) There is no way that these can exist except in the marriage of one man with one wife.<p>This conclusion follows from everything which has so far been said, and it is also the conclusion to be drawn from all that remains to be said. There is therefore no need for any special discussion to prove this. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #181 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>181. (22). These blessings are not at all possible except in a marriage of one man with one wife. This follows as a conclusion from everything that has been said previously, and it will also follow as a conclusion from everything that remains to be said hereafter. Consequently there is no need to support it with its own special discussion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #181 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>181. 22. These things are not to be had in any way except in a marriage of one man with one wife. This is the conclusion from everything that has been said so far. And it will also be the conclusion from everything that will be said from here on. Therefore, a demonstration of this proposition by specific comments is not called for. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #181 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>181. XXII. THAT THESE ARE BY NO MEANS POSSIBLE EXCEPT IN THE MARRIAGE OF ONE MAN WITH ONE WIFE. This is the conclusion from all that has hitherto been said. It also forms the conclusion from all that is to be said hereafter. Therefore there is no need to confirm it by any special comment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #181 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>181. (xxii) These can by no means be possessed except in a marriage of one man with one wife. Such is the conclusion from all that has been said; the same conclusion follows from what is still to be said. There is no need of more comment here to establish the point. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #181 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>181. (22) That these things can by no means be except in the marriage of one man with one wife. This is the conclusion from all that has hitherto been said; and it also forms the conclusion from all that is to be said hereafter. There is therefore, no need to confirm it by particular comment. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #181 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>181. XXII: Quod haec nullatenus possint dari, nisi in Conjugio unius Viri cum una Uxore. Est Conclusum ex omnibus illis, quae hactenus dicta sunt; et quoque fit Conclusum ex omnibus illis, quae posthac dicenda sunt; quare ad illud confirmandum peculiari commentatione non opus est. </p>
