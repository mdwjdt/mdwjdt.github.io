<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>370、这些细节揭示了一夫多妻的婚姻之爱爆发所进入的嫉妒之火是何性质，即这火会爆发为愤怒和报复，在性情温和者身上爆发为愤怒，在性情残忍者身上爆发为报复。这是因为他们的爱是属世的，没有属灵的成分。这一点可从有关一夫多妻的论证推知，即：一夫多妻就是淫荡（345节），一夫多妻者只要仍是一夫多妻者，就是属世的，无法变得属灵（347节）。对属世的一夫一妻者来说，嫉妒之火就不同了。他们的爱反对女人时以这种方式被点燃，反对入侵者时则以另一种方式被点燃。反对后者时，它变成愤怒，反对前者时则变成冷漠。一夫多妻者则不然，他们的嫉妒之火还会怒火中烧。这也是以下情形的原因之一：死后，一夫多妻者的妻妾们绝大部分获得自由，被安排住进无人看守的女子公寓，在那里制作各种女红类手工艺品。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>370、这表明了一夫多妻制的嫉妒就象火一样，充满气愤和仇恨。这是因为他们的爱是自然性的，没有一点精神成份。这与前面一夫多妻制章节中所讲的一致。一夫多妻者只要处于一夫多妻的状态，就是自然性的而不能变得有精神性。</p><p>在一夫一妻制中的自然人的嫉妒却是另一种性质。他们的爱之怒火不是指向女人，而是指向入侵者。对入侵者表现为气愤，对女人表现为冷漠。而在一夫多妻者中却不是这样。他们的嫉妒之火充满着愤怒。这也是一夫多妻制中的妻子和妾在死后都多数被准许有自由，住在女人们的居所，做着与女性相关的事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #370 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>370. These details reveal the nature of the jealous fire, into which the conjugial love of polygamists bursts forth, as being anger and revenge; anger in the case of the civilised, revenge in the case of the uncivilised. This happens because their love is natural with no share in the spiritual. This follows from what was proved in the chapter on polygamy; namely, that polygamy is wantonness (<a href="345.htm">345</a>) and the polygamist, so long as he remains a polygamist, is natural and cannot become spiritual (<a href="347.htm">347</a>).<p>The fire of jealousy among the natural monogamists is, however, different. Their love is not aroused so much against women as against violators. They are the object of anger, the women the object of coldness. It is different with polygamists, whose fire of jealousy also blazes with the stimulus of revenge. This too is one of the reasons why after death most of the mistresses and wives of polygamists are set free, and sent to unguarded women's quarters to engage in the various handicrafts proper to women. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #370 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>370. This illustrates indeed the nature of the jealous fire that a polygamous conjugial love blazes up into, namely, into anger and vengeance - into anger in the mild-tempered, and into vengeance in the savage-tempered. And the reason is that their love is natural and does not partake of anything spiritual. This follows from what we demonstrated in the chapter on polygamy and the points made there, that polygamy is lechery (no. <a href="345.htm">345</a>), and that a polygamist is natural and cannot become spiritual as long as he remains a polygamist (no. <a href="347.htm">347</a>).<p>Jealous fire in natural people who are monogamists, however, is of another character. Their love is not set on fire in the same way against the women, but against the trespassers. Towards them it becomes anger, and towards the women, coldness. Not so in the case of polygamists. The fire of their jealousness blazes also with a vengeful fury. This, too, is one of the reasons that the concubines and wives of polygamists are for the most part, after death, set free, and assigned to unguarded women's residences, there to make various articles connected with the crafts of women. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #370 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>370. These things certainly illustrate the sort of fire of jealousy that polygamous married love breaks into - wrathful and vindictive - wrathful in gentle people and vindictive in harsh people.<p>This happens because their love is worldly and does not partake of anything spiritual. This follows from things pointed out in the chapter about polygamy - that polygamy is lascivious (no. 345), and that a polygamist is worldly so long as he remains a polygamist and cannot be made spiritual (no. <a href="347.htm">347</a>).<p>But the fire of jealousy is another thing in worldly monogamists.<p>Their love does not take fire against the women, but against the violators. It becomes anger against them, but cold towards the women. It is different in polygamists whose jealous fire also flares up in frenzy of revenge. This is also among the reasons why the polygamists' mistresses and wives are mostly set free after death and are assigned to unguarded apartments for women, to produce various things in the line of women's work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #370 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>370. The above illustrates the nature of the jealous fire into which polygamous conjugial love breaks out--a fire breaking out into anger and revenge, into anger in the case of the meek, and into revenge in the case of the fierce. This is because their love is natural and does not partake of what is spiritual. This follows from what was demonstrated in the chapter on Polygamy, namely, that polygamy is lasciviousness (no. <a href="345.htm">345</a>), and that a polygamist, so long as he remains a polygamist, is natural and cannot become spiritual (no. <a href="347.htm">347</a>). With natural monogamists, the jealous fire is different. Their love is not inflamed in this way against the women but against the violators. Against the latter it becomes anger, and against the former cold. Not so with polygamists. Moreover, the fire of their jealousy burns with vengeful fury. This also is among the reasons why after death the concubines and wives of polygamists are for the most part set free, and are assigned to unguarded women's apartments, there to make various things which pertain to women's work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #370 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>370. Such things illustrate well the nature of the jealous fire into which polygamous marital love flares up, namely, into anger and revenge, into anger in the mild, and into revenge in the vehement. The reason is that their love is natural, and does not partake of the spiritual. This follows from the propositions demonstrated in the chapter on "Polygamy": that polygamy is lasciviousness (<a href="345.htm">345</a>), and that a polygamist as long as he remains a polygamist is natural, and cannot become spiritual (<a href="347.htm">347</a>). Jealousy's fire is indeed different with natural men among monogamists; their love is not kindled thus against the women, but against the violators, turning into wrath against the latter but into cold toward the former. But it is otherwise with polygamists; the fire of their jealousy blazes with the frenzy of revenge, too. This is one of the reasons why the concubines and wives of polygamists are usually released after the man's death and assigned to unguarded women's apartments to do various kinds of feminine handicraft. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #370 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>370. These facts illustrate truly of what kind the fire of jealousy is into which polygamous conjugial love breaks out, that it breaks forth into anger and vindictiveness, into anger with those that are gentle, and into vindictiveness with the ungentle; and that this is so because their love is natural, and does not partake of the spiritual. This follows from things shown in the chapter on Polygamy: From this in that chapter: That polygamy is lascivious, n. 345: And that a polygamist so long as he remains a polygamist is natural and cannot become spiritual, n. <a href="347.htm">347</a>. But with the monogamous natural the fire of jealousy is different. Their love is enkindled not so much against the women, but against the violators; against them it becomes anger, and against the women, cold. It is otherwise with the polygamous, the fire of whose jealousy flames also with the frenzy of revenge. And this is also among the reasons why the concubines and wives of polygamists, for the most part, are set free after death and are assigned to women's apartments not guarded, for the skillful production of various things which pertain to women's work. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #370 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>370. Ex his quidem illustratum est, qualis est ignis Zelotypicus, in quem exardescit amor conjugialis polygamicus, quod sit in iram et vindictam, in iram apud mansuetos, et in vindictam apud immansuetos; et hoc fit, <sup>1</sup>quia amor illorum est naturalis, et non participat ex spirituali; hoc consequitur ex demonstratis in Capite de Polygamia, ex his ibi, Quod Polygamia sit lascivia,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_370/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_345" target=_top>345</a>. Et quod polygamus, quamdiu manet polygamus, sit naturalis, et non fieri possit spiritualis,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_370/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_347" target=_top>347</a>. Alius vero est ignis Zelotypicus apud monogamos naturales; horum amor non ita accenditur contra foeminas, sed contra violatores; contra hos fit ira, et contra illas frigus: aliter apud polygamos, quorum Zelotypiae ignis etiam flagrat oestro vindictae: hoc inter causas etiam est, quod pellices et uxores polygamorum post mortem quoad plurem partem manumittantur, et ad gynaecea non custodita, ad concinnandum varia, quae operarum muliebrium sunt, delegentur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: fit; </p>
