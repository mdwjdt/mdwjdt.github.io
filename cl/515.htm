<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第515节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第二十六章  行淫与侵犯属灵婚姻的对应关系</h4><p>515、我本想在此插几句话，以说明对应关系的性质，但这并非本书的主题。我在前文（76，342节）简要概述了对应关系的性质，在《揭秘启示录》一书，从头至尾充分说明了它如何存在于圣言的属世之义和属灵之义之间；在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（尤其该书5-26节）一书证明了圣言包含一个属世之义和一个属灵之义，以及二者之间的对应关系。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">淫乱与对精神性婚姻的侵害之间的关系</h4><p>515、在这里应该讲一下什么是对应关系，但这一内容并非本书要讲的内容。关于对应是什么，在76节和342节中简单概话过。具体内容参见《The Apocalypse Revealed 》。那本书中讲了《圣经》的字面上和精神上的含义。</p><p>关于《圣经》字面上和精神上的含义，在《Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture》一书的5-26节中也做了论述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #515 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>515. XXVI. THE CORRESPONDENCE OF IMMORAL BEHAVIOUR WITH THE VIOLATION OF THE SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE<p>I would have inserted here some preliminary remarks on the nature of correspondence, but this subject does not belong in this work. A brief summary of its nature may be seen above (<a href="76.htm">76</a>, <a href="342.htm">342</a>), and a full account in The Apocalypse Revealed from beginning to end, showing how it exists between the natural and spiritual senses of the Word. It was proved in The Teaching of the New Jerusalem concerning Holy Scripture that the Word contains a natural and a spiritual sense with a correspondence between them (in particular of that book) . [<a href="../ss/5.htm">DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 5-26</a>] </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #515 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>515. THE CORRESPONDENCE OF LICENTIOUSNESS TO VIOLATION OF THE SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE<p>I would start off here with something about correspondence and what it is, but that is not the subject of this book. However, what correspondence is may be seen in summary form in nos. <a href="76.htm">76</a> and <a href="342.htm">342</a> above, and more fully in The Apocalypse Revealed from beginning to end, which deals with the correspondence between the natural meaning and spiritual meaning of the Word.<p>That the Word has a natural meaning and a spiritual meaning, and that there is a correspondence between them - this we showed in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, and specifically in nos. <a href="../ss/5.htm">5-26</a> there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #515 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>515. Chapter 26. How Illicit Sex Corresponds to Profanation of Spiritual Marriage<p>I could say something first about what correspondence is, but it is not the subject of this book. But what correspondence is, is found briefly summarized above (nos. 76 and 342), and Apocalypse Revealed, from start to finish, fully explains that there is correspondence between the worldly sense and the spiritual sense of the Word. The Doctrine for the New Jerusalem Concerning the Sacred Scriptures shows that there is a worldly sense and a spiritual sense in the Word and correspondence between these senses (specifically in nos. <a href="../ss/5.htm">5-26</a> there). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #515 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>515. THE CORRESPONDENCE OF WHOREDOM WITH THE VIOLATION OF SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE<p>I might here premise something respecting correspondence, as to what it is, but this is not the subject of the present work. What correspondence is, however, may be seen above (nos. <a href="76.htm">76</a>,<a href="342.htm">342</a>) in a brief summary, and fully in THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED from beginning to end, showing that there is a correspondence between the natural sense of the Word and its spiritual sense. That in the Word there is a natural sense and a spiritual, and a correspondence between them, has been demonstrated in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE, and specifically in nos. <a href="../ss/5.htm">5-26</a> of that work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #515 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>515. XXV. THE CORRESPONDENCE OF WHOREDOM WITH THE VIOLATION OF SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE<p>I might premise something here about what correspondence is, but the subject does not belong to the present work. The reader may see above (<a href="76.htm">76</a> and<a href="342.htm">342</a>) in a brief summary what correspondence is; and in Apocalypse Revealed from beginning to end, that there is correspondence between the natural and the spiritual sense of the Word. We showed in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem on the Sacred Scripture (especially at nn. 5-26 there) that there is a natural sense in the Word and a spiritual, and correspondence between them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #515 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>515. ON THE CORRESPONDENCE OF SCORTATIONS WITH THE VIOLATION OF THE SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE. <p> <p>I might here premise something respecting correspondence, what it is. But it does not belong to this book; a brief summary as to what correspondence is may be seen above at n. <a href="76.htm">76</a> and n. <a href="342.htm">342</a>, and fully in The Apocalypse Revealed, from beginning to end: that it is the relation between the natural sense and the spiritual sense of the Word. That in the Word there is a natural and a spiritual sense, and a correspondence between them, has been shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem respecting the Sacred Scripture, in particular, n. <a href="../ss/5.htm">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture 5</a>-26 of that work. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #515 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>515. De Correspondentia scortationum cum violatione Conjugii Spiritualis <p>Hic praefaturus essem aliquid de Correspondentia, quid illa, sed hoc non hujus operis est: quid autem Correspondentia, in brevi summario videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_515/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_76" target=_top>76</a>, et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_515/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_342" target=_top>342</a>; ac plene in Apocalypsis Revelata a principio ad finem, quod sit inter sensum naturalem et sensum spiritualem Verbi. Quod in Verbo sit sensus naturalis et sensus spiritualis, et inter illos correspondentia, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra, et in specie,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_515/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_5" target=_top>5-26</a>, ibi demonstratum est. </p>
