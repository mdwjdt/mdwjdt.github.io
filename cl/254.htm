<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #254 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>254. (xviii) The third reason for legitimate separation is impotence before marriage.<p>This is a reason for separation, because the purpose of marriage is the procreation of offspring, and this is impossible in these cases; and knowing this, they deliberately deprive their wives of the hope of children, although it is this hope which nourishes and strengthens their conjugial love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #254 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>254. 18. A third reason for legitimate separation is impotence prior to marriage. This is reason for separation, because the goal of marriage is the procreation of offspring, which the already impotent cannot provide. Moreover, because they know this beforehand, they deliberately deprive their partners of any hope of children, a hope which nevertheless nourishes and sustains the conjugial love of women. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #254 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>254. 18. A third legitimate cause of separation is impotence before marriage. This is a cause of separation because marriage's purpose is offspring, which is impossible for the impotent. Knowing this beforehand, they purposely deny their wives this hope that suckles and strengthens their marital love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #254 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>254. XVIII. THAT THE THIRD CAUSE OF LEGITIMATE SEPARATION IS IMPOTENCE BEFORE MARRIAGE. The reason why this is a cause of separation is because the end of marriage is the procreation of offspring, and with the impotent this is impossible; and since they know this beforehand, they purposely deprive their wives of the hope of it, a hope which nevertheless suckles and strengthens the conjugial love of women. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #254 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>254. (xviii) A third cause of legitimate separation is impotence before marriage. This is a cause of separation because procreation of offspring is an end in marriage, and by the impotent is impossible; and since they know this beforehand, they deliberately deprive their wives of the hope of it, a hope, however, which nourishes and re-enforces their marital love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #254 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>254. (18) The third cause of legitimate separation is impotence before marriage. The reason why this is a cause of separation is, that the end of marriage is the procreation of offspring, and by such it is impossible; and as they know this beforehand they purposely deprive their married partner of the hope of it, the hope which yet should nurse and strengthen their conjugial love. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #254 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>254. XVIII: Quod Tertia causa legitimae separationis sit Impotentia ante conjugium. Quod haec sit causa separationis, est quia finis conjugii est procreatio sobolis, et haec ab illis non dabilis est; et quia praesciunt hoc, conjuges ex proposito deprivant spe ejus, quae spes tamen amorem illarum conjugialem lactat et firmat. </p>
