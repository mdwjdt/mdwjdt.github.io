<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第457节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>457、⑿因为一夫一妻的婚姻原则是人类生命的瑰宝，是基督教的宝库。在有关婚姻之爱及其智慧快乐的整个第一部分，我们既从总体上，也从细节上论证了这两个点。婚姻之爱是人类生命的瑰宝，因为人所享有的婚姻之爱如何，其生命就如何。婚姻之爱构成其生命的至内层，是与其爱同居的智慧之生命，以及与其智慧同居的爱之生命，因而是二者的快乐之生命。简言之，正是这爱使人成为一个活的灵魂。正因如此，一夫一妻的婚姻原则被称为人类生命的瑰宝。<br><br>上述内容证实了这一点：唯有与一位妻子，真正的婚姻友谊、信任、性能力才有可能，因为这是一种心智的联结（333，334节）；属天的祝福，属灵的幸福和属世的快乐自起初就被提供给那些享有真正婚姻之爱的人，它们就存在并起源于这联结（335节）；这爱是一切属天和属灵之爱，以及由此而来的一切属世之爱的根基之爱，一切欢喜和快乐，从初至末，皆汇集于这爱（65-69节）；就其源头而言，它是智慧与爱的嬉戏。这一切在关于婚姻之爱的智慧快乐，也就是本书第一部分已得以充分论证。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>457、（12）这两点已经在前面关于婚姻之爱及其智慧章节上讲得很清楚。</p><p>婚姻之爱是人类的珍宝，是因为人生命的性质特征也就是他的爱的特征。爱构成了生命的最基础元素。人是其爱的活的灵魂。</p><p>这点还会从前面的章节中看到。真正的婚姻中的友谊，信任只有在一个妻子时才是可能的，因为这种情况下，头脑是统一的；从那统一中产生了天国的祝福，精神上的活力和自然上的快乐。这一爱是一切天国的，精神的和自然之爱的基础；在这一爱中间有一切快乐。另外在Delights of Wisdom Relating to Married love 一节中讲到了它的源泉，这种爱作用于智慧和爱之间。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #457 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>457. (xii) Seeing that the principle of marriage of one husband and one wife is the jewel of human life and a treasure-house of Christian religion.<p>These two points have been proved as general principles and in detail in the whole of the first part on conjugial love and the delights of its wisdom. It is the jewel of human life, because a person's life is such as is the conjugial love he has, for this makes up the inmost level of his life. This is the life of wisdom living together with its love, or of love living together with its wisdom, so that it is the life of the delights of both. In short, it is that love which makes a person a living soul; and hence the principle of one man marrying one wife is called the jewel of human life.</p><p>[2] This is proved by the following points which were made above. With one wife truly conjugial friendship, trust and potency is possible, because it is a union of minds (<a href="333.htm">333-334</a>). It is the place and origin of the celestial blessedness, the spiritual happiness and so the natural pleasures which have been provided from the beginning for those who enjoy truly conjugial love (<a href="335.htm">335</a>). It is the foundation of all celestial, spiritual and so natural loves, and on it are conferred all joys and delights from first to last (<a href="65.htm">65-69</a>). As regards its source, it is the sport of wisdom and love, as was fully proved in the Delights of Wisdom concerning Conjugial Love, which is the title of the first part of this book. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #457 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>457. 12. For the conjugial union of one man with one wife is the precious jewel of human life and the repository of Christian religion. These two points are ones we have already demonstrated universally and singly in the entire preceding part on conjugial love and the delights of its wisdom.<p>Conjugial love is the precious jewel of human life because the character of a person's life is such as the character of that love in him, that love forming the inmost element of his life. For it is the life of wisdom dwelling together with its love, and of love dwelling together with its wisdom, and thus it is the life of the delights of both. In a word, a person is a living soul as a result of that love. That is why we call the conjugial union of one man with one wife the precious jewel of human life.</p><p>[2] This conclusion is supported by observations made above: that truly conjugial friendship, trust and potency are possible with only one wife, because only then is there a union of minds (nos. <a href="333.htm">333</a>, <a href="334.htm">334</a>); that in and from that union spring the celestial blessings, spiritual felicities and natural delights which from the beginning have been provided for people who are in a state of truly conjugial love (no. <a href="335.htm">335</a>); that this love is the fundamental love of all celestial, spiritual, and consequently natural loves (nos. <a href="65.htm">65-67</a>); and that into this love have been gathered all joys and all delights, from the first to the last of them (nos. <a href="68.htm">68</a>, <a href="69.htm">69</a>). Moreover, in Delights of Wisdom Relating to Conjugial Love, which forms Part One of this work, it was fully shown that regarded in its origin, this love is the interplay of wisdom and love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #457 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>457. 12. Because the marriage relationship of one man with one wife is the precious treasure of human life and the Christian religion's treasury.<p>These are the two things that have been demonstrated generally and in detail in the whole preceding part about the sensible joy of married love. It is the precious treasure of human life because a person's life is just the same as that love in him. It makes his innermost life, for it is the life of wisdom living together with its love and of love living together with its wisdom, and so it is the life of the delights of each of these. In a word, a person is a living soul through this love. This is why the marriage relationship of one man with one wife is called the precious treasure of human life.<p>These things mentioned above confirm it: With one wife real married friendship, confidence, and potency are possible, because a union of minds is possible (nos. <a href="333.htm">333-334</a>). In marriage and from it are the heavenly blessings, spiritual pleasures, and worldly happiness provided from the beginning for those who are in real married love (no. 335). It is the basic love of all heavenly, spiritual and, therefore, worldly loves, and all joys and all kinds of happiness from first to last are gathered together in that love (nos. <a href="65.htm">65-69</a>).<p>And in "The Sensible Joy of Married Love," which is the first part of this book, it is fully shown that viewed in its source it is wisdom playing with love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #457 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>457. XII. BECAUSE THE CONJUGIAL OF ONE MAN WITH ONE WIFE IS THE PRECIOUS JEWEL <sup >1</sup>OF HUMAN LIFE AND THE REPOSITORY OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION. These are the two things which have been demonstrated universally and in detail in the whole of the preceding Part on Conjugial Love and its Delights of wisdom. That it is the precious jewel of human life is because the nature of man's life is such as is the conjugial love with him. This makes the inmost of his life, being the life of wisdom cohabiting with its love, and of love cohabiting with its wisdom. Hence it is the life of the delights of both. In a word, by this love man is a living soul. It is from this that the conjugial of one man with one wife is called the precious jewel of human life. This is confirmed by What was said above, namely, That with one wife, because there is union of minds there is also truly conjugial friendship, confidence, potency (nos. <a href="333.htm">333, 334</a>); that in and from that union are the celestial blessings, spiritual happiness, and thence natural delights which have been provided from the beginning for those Who are in love truly conjugial (no. <a href="335.htm">335</a>); that it is the fundamental love of all celestial and spiritual loves, and thence of all natural loves, and that into it are gathered all joys and gladness from their first to their last (nos. <a href="65.htm">65-69</a>); and that, regarded in its origin, it is the sport of wisdom and love. All this has been fully demonstrated in the Delights of wisdom concerning Conjugial Love which forms the first Part of this work.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Clenodium. This is latinized form of the Swedish klenod (from klen-little and od-property) which means any small precious thing such as jewels, gold ornaments, etc. It is also used of a country, e.g., Gothland is one of Sweden's jewels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #457 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>457. (xii) For the marital tendency of one man to one woman is the jewel of human life and the repository of the Christian religion. These two truths we demonstrated in general and in detail throughout Part I, on "Marital Love: its Wise Delights." Marital love is the jewel of human life for the reason that a man's life is of the same quality as that love. For that love makes his inmost life. It is the life of wisdom cohabiting with its love, and of love cohabiting with its wisdom, and hence the life of the delights of both. In a word, man is a living soul through that love. Hence we call the marital inclination of one man to one wife the jewel of human life. The following propositions, which were demonstrated above, confirm the fact: With one wife there is true marital friendship, trust, and potency, because there is a union of minds (n. <a href="333.htm">333-334</a>); In and from true marital love there are celestial blessednesses, spiritual joys, and hence natural enjoyments, foreseen from the beginning for those in that love (n.335); It is the basic love in all loves, celestial, spiritual and thence natural, and into it are gathered all joy and gladness from first to last (n. <a href="65.htm">65-69</a>); Regarded in its origin it is the interplay of wisdom and love (as we showed fully in "Marital Love: its Wise Delights," which is Part I of this work). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #457 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>457. (12) Inasmuch as the conjugial of one man with one wife is the precious treasure of human life, and the repository of the Christian religion. These are the two things which have been shown, universally and particularly, in the whole of the preceding part, On Conjugial Love and the Delights of its Wisdom. It is the precious treasure of human life because the quality of a man's life is such as is the quality of this love in him, for this makes the inmost of his life, for it is the life of wisdom cohabiting with its love, and of love cohabiting with its wisdom, and is therefore, the life of the delights of both. In a word, man is a living soul through this love. Hence it is that the conjugial love of one man with one wife is called the precious treasure of human life. This is confirmed by the following considerations presented above: That with one wife there is friendship truly conjugial, confidence, and potency, because there is a union of minds (n. <a href="333.htm">333</a>, <a href="334.htm">334</a>): That in and from this union are the celestial beatitudes, the spiritual satisfactions, and from these the natural delights, which have been provided from the beginning for those who are in love truly conjugial (n. <a href="335.htm">335</a>): That it is the fundamental love of all celestial, spiritual, and thence of all natural loves; and that into this love are brought together all joys and all gladnesses, from the first to the last (n. <a href="65.htm">65-69</a>): And in The Delights of Wisdom pertaining to Conjugial Love, which forms the first part of this work, it has been fully shown that regarding it in its origin, it is the sport of wisdom and love. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #457 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>457. XII. Quoniam Conjugiale unius viri cum una uxore est clenodium vitae humanae, et reconditorium religionis Christianae. Haec duo sunt, quae universim et singillatim in tota Parte antecedente de Amore conjugiali et ejus sapientiae Delitiis, demonstrata sunt. Quod sit Clenodium vitae humanae, est quia hominis vita talis est, qualis est ille amor apud illum, facit enim intimum vitae ejus; est namque vita sapientiae cohabitantis cum suo amore, et amoris cohabitantis cum sua sapientia, et inde est vita delitiarum utriusque; verbo, homo est anima vivens per illum amorem; inde est, quod conjugiale unius viri cum una uxore dicatur Clenodium vitae humanae.</p><p>[2] Hoc confirmatur ex his supra; Quod cum una uxore detur vere conjugialis amicitia, confidentia, potentia, quia mentium unio,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_457/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_333" target=_top>333</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_457/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_334" target=_top>334</a>: Quod in illo et ex illo dentur beatitudines coelestes, faustitates spirituales, et inde jucunditates naturales, quae ab initio provisae sunt illis, qui in amore vere conjugiali sunt, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_457/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_335" target=_top>335</a>: <sup>1</sup>Quod sit amor fundamentalis omnium amorum coelestium, spiritualium, et inde naturalium, et quod in illum amorem collata sint omnia gaudia et omnes laetitiae a primis ad ultima,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_457/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_65" target=_top>65-69</a>: et quod in origine sua spectatus sit ludus sapientiae et amoris, in delitiis sapientiae de amore conjugiali, quae Partem primam hujus Operis constituunt, plene demonstratum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: 335- </p>
