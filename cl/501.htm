<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第二十二章  奸污处女的淫欲</h4><p>501、下面四章所论述的淫欲不仅仅是奸淫的情欲，它们要严重得多。事实上，它们只出于奸淫，因为它们被那些厌倦了奸淫的人紧抓不放。如第一个主题，即奸污处女的淫欲就不可能发生在前面任何人身上。接下来的主题也一样，即：追求多样化的淫欲，强奸的淫欲和诱奸纯真者的淫欲。这些之所以都被称为淫欲，是因为它们归给人的程度和性质取决于对它们的淫欲的程度和性质。特别是奸污处女的淫欲，为提供一个明显证据，以证明它就是一种罪行，这种淫欲将按以下顺序来阐述：<br><br>⑴童贞女或未失贞的女人婚前和婚后的状态。<br><br>⑵贞操是贞洁的冠冕和婚姻之爱的标志。<br><br>⑶不以结婚为目的而奸污处女是一种强盗罪行。<br><br>⑷死后，那些确认奸污处女的淫欲不是罪恶之人的命运是可怕的。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">诱奸少女的淫乱</h4><p>501、以下四章将要讲的不但是通奸，而是更严重意义上的通奸。它们是在当通奸变得无聊时产生的。</p><p>对于诱奸少女我们将依以下顺序来讲述：</p><p>（1）处女或没有被动过的女人在婚前和婚后的状态是怎样的。</p><p>（2）贞操是贞节的女人的贵冠，是婚姻之爱的象征。</p><p>（3）没有结婚的意向而诱奸少女就是强盗行为。</p><p>（4）那些认为诱奸是无罪的人在死后会有悲惨的命运。</p><p>具体做如下解释。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #501 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>501. XXII. THE LUST FOR DEFLOWERING VIRGINS<p>The lusts discussed in the next four chapters are not merely adulterous lusts, but more serious than these, since they do not arise except as the result of adultery; for they are seized on by those who have become tired of adultery. For instance, the lust for deflowering virgins, the first subject, something which cannot previously arise in any case. Equally the following subjects: the lust for variety, the lust for rape and the lust for seducing the innocent. These are called lusts, because they are made one's own in proportion to their scale and nature.<p>As regards the lust for deflowering in particular, this will be set forth in the following sequence, to provide an evident proof that it is a crime.<p>(i) The state of a virgin or untouched woman before marriage and after marriage.<p>(ii) Virginity is the crown of chastity and a pledge of conjugial love.<p>(iii) Deflowering with no intent to marry is a piratical crime.<p>(iv) The fate after death of those who have convinced themselves that the lust for deflowering is not a sinful evil is dire.<p>There now follows an explanation of these points. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #501 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>501. THE LUST TO DEFLOWER<p>The lusts described in the following four chapters not only are lusts of adultery, but they are still more grave, since they do not arise except in consequence of adulteries, being embraced after adulteries become tiresome. So, for example, the lust to deflower, which we consider first, which cannot possibly arise in anyone before then. The same is true of the lust for variety, the lust to rape, and the lust to seduce states of innocence, which we consider in the chapters that follow next.<p>We call these lusts, because the degree and nature of the lust for them determines the degree and nature of one's embracement of them.<p>With respect to the lust to deflower specifically, in order to impart a clear conviction that it is wicked, its wickedness will be made manifest from the following considerations in turn:<p>1. What the state of a virgin or untouched woman is before marriage and after marriage.<p>2. Virginity is the crown of her chastity and a token of conjugial love.<p>3. Defloration without intention of marriage is the villainous act of a robber.<p>4. Those who persuade themselves that the lust to deflower is not a sinful evil, after death suffer a grievous fate.<p>Explanation of these statements now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #501 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>501. Chapter 22. Lust for Defloration<p>The lusts that the next four chapters deal with are not just lusts for adultery, but worse, because they are only there on account of adulteries, since they are taken up after adulteries become loathsome - like lust for defloration, to be dealt with first, which cannot begin in someone before that stage, and, similarly, lust for variety, lust for rape, and lust for seducing innocent women, which are dealt with afterwards. They are called lusts because you make them your own according to how much and in what way you lust for them.<p>The following topics in a series will clarify what specifically applies to lust for defloration, to make the point clearly that it is a shameful act.<p>1. A virgin's, or inexperienced woman's, condition before marriage and after marriage.<p>2. Virginity is the crown of chastity and a token of married love.<p>3. Defloration without the goal of marriage is the shameful act of a thief.<p>4. After death the fate of those who in their own minds establish that lust for defloration is not a sinful evil is serious.<p>An explanation of these topics follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #501 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>501. THE LUST OF DEFLORATION<p>The lusts treated of in the following four chapters are not merely lusts of adultery, they are more grievous, for they come only from adulteries, being taken up after adulteries have become loathsome. Thus, until then, the lust of defloration, which is first to be treated of, cannot have its rise with any one, and this is equally true of the lust of variety, the lust of violation, and the lust of seducing innocences, to be treated of in what follows. They are called lusts because, according to the measure and nature of the lust for them, such is the measure and nature of their appropriation. As specifically regards the lust of defloration, to give clear conviction that it is a shameful thing, this shall be made manifest from the following propositions in their order:<p>I. The state of a virgin or undeflowered woman before marriage and after marriage.<p>II. That virginity is the crown of chastity and the token of conjugial love.<p>III. That defloration without the end of marriage is the shameful deed of a robber.<p>IV. That after death the lot of those who have confirmed themselves in the lust of defloration as not being an evil of sin, is grievous.<p>The explanation of the above now follows: </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #501 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>501. THE LUST OF DEFLOWERING<p>The lusts of which we treat in the four chapters beginning herewith not only are lusts of adultery but are still more serious, for they come only of adulteries, being resorted to after these have grown tiresome; such as the lust of deflowering to be considered now, which cannot arise earlier with any one; likewise the lust for variety, the lust of violation, and the lust of seducing innocences (of which in what follows). We speak of lusts because such things are made one's own in the measure and nature of the lust for them. As for the lust of deflowering in particular, its heinousness will be made plain to conviction under the following heads:<p>I. The state of the virgin or undeflowered woman before marriage and after marriage.<p>II. Virginity is the crown of chastity and the token of marital love.<p>III. Deflowering with no purpose of marriage is the atrocious act of a robber.<p>IV. The lot after death of those who are confirmed in the view that the lust of deflowering is not an evil of sin, is grievous.<p>Explanation of these propositions follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #501 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>501. ON THE LUST OF DEFLORATION.<p>The lusts that are treated of in the four chapters following are not only lusts of adultery, but more grievous than they, seeing that they do not exist except from adulteries; for they are seized upon after adulteries are loathed. As the lust of defloration, the first treated of, which cannot begin with anyone before; equally so the lust of varieties, the lust of violation, and the lust of seducing innocences, the consideration of which lusts is to follow. They are called lusts, because according to the measure and the quality of the lust for them, so great and of such quality is the appropriation of them. As regards the lust of defloration, in particular, to make evident the conviction that it is infamous, the subject shall be exhibited under these heads:<p>(1) From the state of a virgin or undefiled woman before marriage and after marriage.<p>(2) That virginity is the crown of chastity and the token of conjugial love.<p>(3) That defloration without the purpose of marriage is the infamous act of a robber.<p>(4) That the lot after death of those who have confirmed within them that the lust of defloration is not an evil of sin is grievous.<p>The elucidation of this now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #501 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>501. De Libidine Deflorationis <p>Libidines, de quibus in quatuor Capitibus posthac sequentibus agitur, non modo sunt libidines adulterii, sed illis graviores, quoniam non dantur nisi ex Adulteriis, nam captantur postquam adulteria fastidiuntur; sicut Libido deflorationis, de qua primum agitur, quae non prius exordiri potest apud aliquem; pariter Libido varietatum, Libido violationis, et Libido seducendi innocentias, de quibus sequitur. Dicuntur Libidines, quia quanta et qualis est Libido ad illa, tanta et talis est appropriatio illorum. Quod in specie Libidinem deflorationis concernit, ut convictio evidens fiat quod sit flagitium, manifestabitur ex his in ordine.<p>I. <sup>1</sup>Ex statu virginis seu foeminae illibatae ante conjugium, et post conjugium.<p>II. Quod Virginitas sit corona castitatis, et tessera amoris conjugialis.<p>III. Quod defloratio absque fine conjugii sit flagitium praedonis.<p>IV. Quod sors illorum, qui apud se confirmaverunt libidinem deflorationis non esse malum peccati, post mortem gravis sit. Sequitur horum Explicatio.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: I, </p>
