<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第三章  死后夫妻的状况</h4><p>45、前面说到，天堂也有婚姻。现说明，在世时所缔结的婚约死后是否会延续下去并保持稳定。将这一切公之于众很有必要，因为这不是判断的问题，而是我的亲身经历，我的这些经历来自与天使并灵人的交往。不过，对我来说，将其公开还须经得起理性检验。另外，已婚夫妇都渴望并想要知道这一切。深爱妻子（若她们已去世）的丈夫和深爱丈夫（若他们已去世）的妻子很想知道他们是否一切安好，他们能否再相逢。许多夫妻还想预先知道，死后他们是分开还是继续共同生活。性情不合的夫妻想知道他们能否分开，情投意合的夫妻则想知道他们能否继续共同生活。所以，为了满足这些人的愿望，我将按以下顺序公开我的经历：<br><br>⑴死后，人皆保持两性情爱，这爱正如它内在的样子，也就是说，如在世时它存在于人的内在思维和意愿中的样子。<br><br>⑵婚姻之爱同样会保持它内在的样子，也就是说，如在世时它存在于人的内在思维和意愿中的样子。<br><br>⑶死后，绝大多数夫妻会相见，认出彼此，再度交往，并一起生活一段时间，这一切发生在第一个状态，也就是如他们在世时那样的外在状态。<br><br>⑷然而，随着他们日益脱去外在，进入内在，他们逐渐察觉对彼此的爱情的性质和相互情感，从而察觉他们能否继续共同生活。<br><br>⑸若能共同生活，他们仍是婚姻伴侣，否则，就会分开，有时是丈夫离开妻子，有时是妻子离开丈夫，有时彼此都离开。<br><br>⑹然后，男人会被赐予一个合适的妻子，女人会被赐予一个合适的丈夫。<br><br>⑺夫妻彼此间会享有和在世时一样的亲密关系，只是更快乐、更幸福，但不会生育孩子，取而代之的是属灵的生育，也就是爱和智慧的生育。<br><br>⑻这是上天堂者的情形，但下地狱者的情形则不同。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">死后夫妇两人的境况</h4><p>45、我们在前一章节中讲到天堂中存在着婚姻。在这一章节中我们将看一下是否世间的婚姻之后继续存在。</p><p>有必要揭示这一事实，因为这并不是我所做的判断而是我的亲身经历，这是我与精灵及天使们接触而得到的经历。</p><p>结了婚的夫妇们渴望了解死后他们的境况。爱他们的妻子的男人们想要知道爱妻，在另一个世界中是否过得好。同样，爱他们的丈夫的妻子们想要知道他们的丈夫在另一个世界中如何。他们想知道他们会不会再见面。</p><p>许多夫妇还想知道在死后，夫妻两人是相互分离还是继续在一起。那些彼此不和的夫妇想要知道死后他们是不是相分离。那些彼此和睦的夫妇想要知道他们会不会继续在一起。</p><p>因为人们想要了解这些，下面我依次来阐述一下：</p><p>（1）每个人死后对异性的爱在内在上还是一样的。也就是说，与这个人在世间时所思所想的一样。</p><p>（2）婚姻之爱也是这样。</p><p>（3）多数夫妇在死后会见面，会认出对方，继续生活一段时间。这发生在第一阶段，此时他们还保留着他们在世间时的许多</p><p>多性质。</p><p>（4）夫妇两人开始脱掉外在的性质，而呈现内在的特性。他们会逐渐看清楚他们彼此之间的爱是什么样的，进而决定他们是否会继续在一起。</p><p>（5）若两人还可以在一起，他们将还是夫妇。若不可能的话，他们就会分离。有些情况下，丈夫离开妻子；有些时候，妻子离开丈夫。还有些时候，他们相互远离对方</p><p>（6）男人将会有一个适合他的妻子，女人将会有一个适合她的丈夫。</p><p>（7）夫妻两人还会有像在世间时一样的亲密关系，但不会孕育更多的孩子。取而代之的是两人会产生精神上的延续，即爱和智慧的延续。</p><p>（8）这就是天堂中的情况。进入地狱的人们将会是另外一种情形。</p><p>以下进一步做详细解释：</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #45 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>45. III. THE STATE OF MARRIED COUPLES AFTER DEATH<p>I have just demonstrated the existence of marriage in the heavens, so I must now show whether or not the marital bond entered into in the world will last and remain stable after death. Since this is not a matter of judgment but of experience, something I have been given by associating with angels and spirits, it is for me to pass it on, but in such a way as to gain support from reason. To know about this is something married couples hope and long for. For husbands who have loved their wives, if their wives are dead, want to know whether all is well with them, and whether they will meet again; and likewise wives who have loved their husbands. Many couples too want to know in advance whether they will be parted after death or will live together. Those whose dispositions are not in harmony want to know if they will be parted; those whose dispositions are in harmony whether they will live together. So to satisfy these wishes I shall pass on my experiences, in the following sequence.<p>(i) Everyone retains his sexual love after death, exactly as it was inwardly; that is, as it was inwardly in his thought and will while in the world.<p>(ii) The same is true of conjugial love.<p>(iii) Married couples generally meet after death, recognise each other, renew their association and for some time live together. This happens in their first state, while they are concerned with outward matters as in the world.<p>(iv) But by stages, as they put off their outward state and enter instead into their inward one, they perceive what their mutual loves and feelings towards each other were like, and whether or not they can live together.<p>(v) If they are able to live together, they remain a married couple. But if not they part, sometimes the husband leaving the wife, sometimes the wife leaving the husband, and sometimes each leaving by mutual agreement.<p>(vi) In this case a man is given a suitable wife, and the woman likewise a husband.<p>(vii) Married couples enjoy living together in the same way as in the world, but this is more pleasant and blessed. It does not, however, lead to the procreation of children, but their place is taken by spiritual offspring, love and wisdom.<p>(viii) This is what happens to those who go to heaven, but not to those who go to hell.<p>I shall now explain how each of these statements can be demonstrated and proved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #45 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>45. THE STATE OF MARRIED PARTNERS AFTER DEATH<p>We have just shown in the preceding chapter that marriages exist in heaven. In this chapter we will now show whether or not a marriage covenant contracted in the world will continue and remain in force after death.<p>It is necessary that I make this known, because it is not a matter of judgment but of personal experience, and I have had this experience through association with angels and spirits. Nevertheless, I must make it known in such a way that reason may also assent.<p>Among the prayers and yearnings of married partners, moreover, is a wish to know the state of married partners after death. For men who have loved their wives wish to know - if their wives have died - whether it is well with them. So, too, wives who have loved their husbands. And they want to know whether they will meet again.<p>Many married couples also would like to know in advance whether partners separate after death or whether they stay together. Those who are discordant in spirit wish to know whether partners separate. And those who are concordant in spirit wish to know whether they stay together.<p>Because these are some of the things people would like answers to, they will be made known, and this will be done in the following order:<p>1. In every person after death, love for the opposite sex continues to be what it was like inwardly, that is, what it was like in the person's inner will and thought in the world.<p>2. Likewise conjugial love.<p>3. Most married couples meet after death, recognize each other, associate again, and live together for a time, which occurs in their first state, thus while they are still maintaining the outward aspects of their lives as they did in the world.<p>4. Progressively, however, as married partners put off outward appearances and enter into their inward qualities, they gradually perceive what sort of love and mutual feeling they had had for each other, and consequently whether it is possible for them to live together or not.<p>5. If it is possible for married partners to live together, they remain partners. But if it is not possible, they separate, the husband sometimes separating from the wife, the wife sometimes from the husband, and both of them sometimes from each other.<p>6. A man is then given a suitable wife, and a woman, likewise, a suitable husband.<p>7. Married couples enjoy the same intimate relations with each other as in the world, only more delightful and blessed, but without begetting children. Instead of or to take the place of begetting children, they experience a spiritual procreation, which is one of love and wisdom.<p>8. This is what happens in the case of people who come into heaven. It is different, however, with those who go to hell.<p>Development of this outline now follows, elucidating and supporting the various statements: </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #45 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>45. Chapter 3. The Condition of Married Partners After Death<p>I have just demonstrated that there are marriages in heaven.<p>Now for the marriage covenant made in the world - whether it will continue and hold fast after death or not.<p>This is not a matter of opinion but of experience, which I have had through association with angels and spirits, so it is up to me to pass it on, and in a way that reason accepts. It is one of the things married people hope and pray to know. For men who loved their wives, and whose wives have died, want to know if their wives are all right, and whether they and their wives will meet again, just as wives who loved their husbands do. And many married people want to know ahead of time whether they will be separated or will live together after death. Those with incompatible minds want to know if they will be separated, and those with compatible minds want to know if they will live together. Since this will be welcome information, I pass it on, arranged this way:<p>1. After death every person's sexual love stays the way it was inwardly in the world - that is, as it was in his inward desire and thought.<p>2. The same goes for marital love.<p>3. Married partners usually do meet after death, recognize each other, get together again and live together for a while.<p>This happens in the first state, when they live, outwardly, as they had in the world.<p>4. But gradually, as they shed the superficialities and settle into what they are like inwardly, they find out what their love and their attraction for each other was like, and whether or not they can live as one.<p>5. If they can live as one they remain married, but if they cannot they separate, sometimes the man from the wife, sometimes the wife from the man, and sometimes mutually from each other.<p>6. Then the man gets a suitable wife, and similarly the wife a suitable husband.<p>7. Partners enjoy intercourse with each other just like intercourse in the world, only happier and richer, though without having children. Instead of that, or in place of it, they have spiritual offspring - loves and perceptions.<p>8. This happens to those who enter heaven. It is different for those who go to hell.<p>Now an explanation follows that will illustrate and demonstrate these points. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #45 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>45. THE STATE OF MARRIED PARTNERS AFTER DEATH<p>That there are marriages in the heavens has been shown just above. It is now to be shown whether or not the conjugial covenant entered into in the world will continue after death and be enduring. This is not a matter of judgment but of experience, and since this experience has been granted me through consociation with angels and spirits, the question may be answered by me, but yet in such wise that reason also will assent. Moreover, it is among the wishes and desires of married partners to have this knowledge; for men who have loved their wives, and wives who have loved their husbands, desire to know whether it is well with them after their death, and whether they will meet again. Furthermore many married partners desire to know beforehand whether after death they will be separated or will live together - those who are of discordant dispositions, whether they will be separated, and those who are of concordant dispositions, whether they will live together. This information, being desired, shall be given, and this in the following order:<p>I. That after death, love of the sex remains with every man such as it had been interiorly, that is, in his interior will and thought, in the world.<p>II. That the same is true of conjugial love.<p>III. That after death, two married partners, for the most part, meet, recognize each other, again consociate, and for some time live together; which takes place in the first state, that is, while they are in externals as in the world.<p>IV. But that successively, as they put off their externals and come into their internals, they perceive the nature of the love and inclination which they had for each other, and hence whether they can live together or not.<p>V. That if they can live together, they remain married partners; but if they cannot, they separate, sometimes the man from the wife, sometimes the wife from the man, and sometimes each from the other.<p>VI. And that then a suitable wife is given to the man, and a suitable husband to the woman.<p>VII. That married partners enjoy similar intercourse with each other as in the world, but more delightful and blessed, yet without prolification; for which, or in place of it, they have spiritual prolification, which is that of love and wisdom.<p>VIII. That this is the case with those who go to heaven; but not so with those who go to hell.<p>The explanation now follows whereby these articles are illustrated and confirmed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #45 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>45. II. THE STATE OF PARTNERS AFTER DEATH<p>In our first chapter we showed that there are marriages in the heavens; here our question is, whether or not the particular marital tie formed in the world will remain and endure after death. As this is not a matter for judgment but for observation, and I have been enabled to make the observation through association with angels and spirits, I must relate what the facts are; but still in a fashion to engage the reason in assent. Partners long and desire to know how this is. Husbands who have loved their deceased wives, and wives who have loved their husbands, want to know whether it is well with them, and whether they will meet again. Many partners also wish to know whether they will be parted after death or live together; those who are inharmonious of mind, whether they will not be separated; those harmonious of mind, whether they will not live together. Because it is sought, the information is offered, and will be presented in this order:<p>I. Love for the sex continues after death with every person such as it was inwardly, that is, such as it was in the interior will and thought in the world.<p>II. In the same way, marital love persists.<p>III. Two partners usually meet after death, recognize each other, associate again, and for a time live together. This takes place in the first state, thus while they are in externals as in the world.<p>IV. But gradually, as they put off externals and enter into their internal selves, then perceive of what sort their love and inclination for each other had been, and thus whether they can live together or not.<p>V. If they can live together, they remain partners; but if they cannot, they part, sometimes the man from the wife, sometimes the wife from the man, and sometimes the two mutually.<p>VI. The man is then given a suitable wife, and the woman a suitable husband.<p>VII. Partners enjoy an intercourse like that in the world, but pleasanter and more blessed; but without prolification, for which, or in its place, there is spiritual prolification, which is one of love and wisdom.<p>VIII. This is what befalls those who come into heaven; but it is otherwise with those who go into hell.<p>Explanation follows, elucidating and demonstrating these propositions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #45 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>45. ON THE STATE OF MARRIED PARTNERS AFTER DEATH.<p>It has just been shown above that there are marriages in the heavens. It is now to be shown whether or not the marriage covenant entered into in the world will continue and be enduring after death or not. As this is not a matter of judgment, but of experience, and this experience has been granted me through consociation with angels and spirits, by me it is to be made known; but yet in such wise that reason also shall assent. It is also among the wishes and desires of the married to have this knowledge; for men who loved their wives, and wives who loved their husbands desire, if they have died, to know whether it is well with them, and whether they will meet again. And many of the married desire to know beforehand whether they will be separated after death, or will live together - those who are mentally discordant with each other, whether they shall be separated; and those that are in mental concord, whether they will live together. This information being desired is to be given, and in this order: -<p>(1) That the love of the sex remains after death with every man (Latin: homo), of such quality as it was interiorly, that is, in. his interior will and thought, in the world.<p>(2) That the same is true of conjugial love.<p>(3) That two married partners most commonly meet after death, recognize each other, consociate again, and for some time live together; which takes place in the first state, that is, while they are in externals as in the world.<p>(4) But successively, as they put off things external and come into their internals, they perceive the quality of the love and inclination which they mutually had for each other, and thus perceive whether they can live together or not.<p>(5) That if they can live together they remain married partners; but if they cannot they separate, sometimes the husband from the wife, sometimes the wife from the husband, and sometimes each from the other.<p>(6) And that then a suitable wife is given to the man, and a suitable husband to the woman.<p>(T) That married partners enjoy similar intercourse with each other as in the world, only more delightful and blessed, but without prolification; for which, or in place of it, they have spiritual prolification, which is of love and wisdom.<p>(8) That this is thus with those that come into heaven; but with those that go into hell it is otherwise.<p>The explanation now follows whereby these propositions are illustrated and confirmed. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #45 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>45. DE STATU CONJUGUM POST MORTEM <p>Quod Conjugia in Coelis sint, mox supra ostensum est; hic nunc, num Foedus conjugiale pactum in Mundo, mansurum et stabile futurum sit post mortem, vel non; hoc quia non est res judicii, sed experientiae, et haec mihi data est per consociationem cum Angelis et Spiritibus, a me tradendum est; at usque ita, ut quoque ratio adstipuletur: inter vota et desideria Conjugum etiam est scire illud; Viri enim qui amaverunt uxores suas, si mortuae sunt, volunt scire num bene illis sit, similiter Uxores quae amaverunt viros suos, et num iterum conveniant; multi etiam conjuges optant praescire, num post mortem separentur, vel num una vivant; illi qui inter se animis discordant, numne separentur; ac illi qui animis concordant, numne una vivant: haec quia ex optatis sunt, tradentur; quod fiet in hoc ordine. <p>I. Quod Amor sexus maneat apud omnem hominem post mortem, qualis ille interius, hoc est, in interiore ejus voluntate et cogitatione fuerat in Mundo. <p>II. Quod Amor conjugialis similiter. <p>III. Quod duo Conjuges utplurimum post mortem conveniant, se cognoscant, iterum consocient, et per aliquod tempus vivant simul; quod fit in Primo statu, ita dum in externis sunt sicut in Mundo. <p>IV. Sed quod successive, sicut exuunt externa, ac intrant in interna sua, percipiant quali amore et inclinatione inter se ad se mutuo fuerant, et inde num possint una vivere, vel non. <p>V. Quod si possunt una vivere, maneant conjuges, at si non possunt, se separent, quandoque se Vir ab Uxore, quandoque se Uxor a Viro, et quandoque se uterque ab invicem. <p>VI. Et quod tunc detur viro uxor conveniens, ac foeminae maritus similiter. <p>VII. Quod Conjuges inter se fruantur consortiis similibus, quibus in Mundo, sed jucundioribus et beatioribus; verum absque prolificatione, pro qua, seu loco ejus, est illis prolificatio spiritualis, quae est amoris et sapientiae. <p>VIII. Quod ita fiat illis, qui veniunt in Coelum; aliter vero illis qui in Infernum. Sequitur nunc Explicatio, per quam Articuli illi illustrantur et confirmantur. </p>
