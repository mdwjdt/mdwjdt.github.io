<h4 align="center"></h4><p>4、第七组，就是由于光线其他人看不见的那一组，来自东方天堂。他们与拿号筒的天使同属一个社群。当他们在天上听说，基督教界没有一个人知道何为天上的喜乐和永恒的幸福时，彼此说：“这不可能是真的。基督徒中怎会有如此黑暗和愚痴呢？我们何不下去，亲耳听听是不是真的？果如此，那定是咄咄怪事。”<br><br>于是，他们对拿号筒的天使说：“你知道，凡渴望上天堂，并对天上喜乐持有定见者，死后都被允许体验他们所想象的快乐。他们通过亲身体验看清这些快乐的本质，意识到它们不过是头脑的空洞想法和自己的胡思乱想，如此被引离出来，并接受指教。灵人界的绝大多数人，若在世时深思天堂，并对天上喜乐形成某种定见，以至于渴望体验它们，就会遇到这种情况。”闻听此言，拿号筒的天使对这六组基督教界的智者说：“跟我来，我必带你们体验你们所想象的快乐，从而进入天堂。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>4、（1）第七组，因为光线而不为其它人所见，他们来自天堂的东部。他们与吹喇叭的天使一样，是来自同一地方的天使。当他们听到在他们的天堂中来自基督界的人没有一个知道什么是天国之乐及永恒的快乐时，他们说：“这不可能是真的。这样的黑暗、麻木不可能存在于基督徒中。我们也到下面去，看看是否是真的。若是真的，无疑是件很令人吃惊的事情。”</p><p>（2）这些天使们对拿着喇叭的天使说：“你知道，渴望天堂并对天堂之乐有一些特定见解的所有人，在死后都会被介绍到他们所理解的快乐中。然后，在他们经历了这些快乐并发现它们只是些空洞的理论，他们就会被带出那些天国之乐并受到教导。这种情况发生在精神世界中的许多人身上。他们在世间时思考过天堂，并根据他们的渴望程度而形成对天国之乐的理解。”听到这些，拿喇叭的天使对这六组基督教界的智者说：“跟我来，我带领你们到你们的快乐之中，进而进入天堂。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #4 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>4. The seventh group, whom the light rendered invisible to the rest, was from the east of heaven. They were angels from the same community as the angel with the trumpet. When the news reached them in their heaven that not a single person in Christendom knew what the joy of heaven and everlasting happiness were, they said to one another: 'This cannot possibly be true. There cannot be such thick darkness and mental stupor among Christians. Why do we not go down too and hear whether this is true? If it is, it is certainly a portent.'</p><p> [2] Then they said to the angel with the trumpet: 'You know that every person who had longed to go to heaven and had any definite ideas about its joys is after death allowed to experience the joys he imagined; and after they have found out by experience what those joys are like, and realise that they are empty ideas in their minds and ravings of their imaginations, they are taken away from them and taught. This happens to most people in the world of spirits, who in their previous lives had thought deeply about heaven, and come to some conclusion about its joys, so as to desire to experience them.' On hearing this the angel with the trumpet said to the six groups summoned from the wise of the Christian world: 'Follow me, and I shall bring you to experience the joys you imagine, and so into heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #4 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>4. The seventh company, invisible to the rest on account of the light, was from the east part of heaven. Its members were angels from the same society that the angel with the trumpet came from. When they heard in their heaven that not even one person in the Christian world knows what the joy of heaven and eternal happiness are, they said to each other, "This cannot be true! Such great darkness and numbness of mind is not possible among Christians. Let us go down, too, and hear for ourselves whether it is so. If it is, it is without doubt an astonishing event."</p><p>[2] These angels now said to the angel with the trumpet, "As you know, everyone who has longed for heaven and has had some particular opinion about the joys there, after death is introduced into the joys of his imagination. Then when he has experienced what those joys are like and found that they reflect empty theories or his own irrational fantasies, he is afterwards taken out of them and instructed. This happens with most in the world of spirits who in their former life thought about heaven and came to some conclusion respecting joys there to the point of longing for them."<p>Hearing this, the angel with the trumpet said to the six companies assembled from the wise of the Christian world, "Follow me and I will introduce you to your joys and so into heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #4 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>4. The seventh group, which the rest could not see for the light, were from the eastern part of heaven. They were angels from the same community as the angel with the trumpet. When they heard in their heaven that not one person in the Christian world knew what the joy of heaven and eternal happiness are, they said to each other, "This can't be true. There can't be such thick darkness and such mental stupidity among Christians. We should go down, too, and hear if it is the truth. And if it is, it is a real omen."<p>Then these angels spoke to the angel with the trumpet. "Every person, as you know, who had wanted heaven and had some particular idea of the joys there, is brought, after death, into the joys he imagined, and after finding out what those joys are like that they are based on their groundless mental notions and confused fantasies - they are brought out again and instructed. This happens in the world of spirits to most people who used to think about heaven in their previous life, and have concluded something about the joys there - enough to want them."<p>The angel with the trumpet heard these words and said to the six groups of wise people from the Christian world who had been called together, "Follow me, and I'll lead you to your joys, or heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #4 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>4. The SEVENTH COMPANY, not visible to the others on account of the light, was from the east of heaven. They were angels from the same society whence came the angel of the trumpet. When they heard in their heaven that not a single person in the Christian world knows what the joy of heaven and eternal happiness are, these angels said one to another "This can never be the truth. There cannot be such great darkness and such mental stupor among Christians. Let us also go down and ourselves hear whether it be the truth. If it is the truth, it is surely a monstrous thing."</p><p>[2] Those angels then said to the angel of the trumpet: "You know that after death all men who had desired heaven, and had some definite thought about the joys there, are introduced into the joys of their imagination; and that when they have learned by experience the nature of these joys, that they are accordant with the vain ideas of their own mind and the ravings of their own fantasy, they are led away from them and instructed. This is done with many spirits in the world of spirits, being spirits who in the former life have meditated about heaven, and have formed so definite a conclusion respecting the joys there, that they desire them."<p>Hearing this, the angel of the trumpet said to the six companies which had been called together from the wise of the Christian world: "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joys, and thus into your heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #4 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>4. The Seventh Company, invisible to the rest because of the light, was from the east in heaven. These were angels from the same society as the angel with the trumpet. On hearing in their heaven that not a person in all Christendom knew what heavenly joy and eternal happiness are, they had told one another, "Surely it is not so. Such thick darkness and obtuseness cannot obtain among Christians. Let us go down and hear whether it is so, for if it is true, it is indeed amazing."</p><p>[2] These angels now said to the angel trumpeter, "You are aware that all who have desired heaven and entertained any definite thought about its joys, are let after death into the joys<p>Which they have pictured; and that when they have tried those joys and found that they only reflect their vain conceits and crazy phantasies, they are brought out of them and instructed."<p>(This takes place in the world of spirits with most of those who in the former life had reflected about heaven and formed some conclusion about heavenly joys to the point of desiring them.)<p>On hearing these words the angel trumpeter said to the six companies assembled from the wise of the Christian world: "Follow me, and I will usher you into your joys and so into heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #4 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>4. The seventh company, not visible to the others on account of the light, was from the east in heaven. They were angels from the same society whence the angel with the trumpet came. When they heard in their heaven that not a single person in the Christian world knew what the joy of heaven and eternal happiness are, they said one to another, 'This certainly is not the truth. There cannot be such thick darkness and such mental stupor among Christians. Let us then go down and hear whether it is the truth, for if true it is indeed marvelous.' These angels then said to the angel with the trumpet, 'You know that every man who had desired heaven, and had any definite thought about the joys there, is introduced after death into the joys of his imagination; and that when they have experienced what those joys are, that they are according to the vain conceits of their mind, and according to their delirious phantasies, then they are led out of them and instructed.'<p>This is done in the world of spirits, in the case of the most of those who in the former life have meditated about heaven, and have formed some conclusion respecting the joys there, even so far as to desire them.<p>Having heard these words, the angel with the trumpet said to the six companies called together from the wise of the Christian world, 'Follow me, and I will lead you into your joys, and so into your heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #4 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>4. Septima Cohors prae luce non reliquis visa, erat ex Oriente Coeli; erant Angeli ex eadem Societate, e qua fuit Angelus tubae: illi cum in suo Coelo audiverunt, quod ne quidem unus in Christiano Orbe sciat, quid Gaudium Coeli, et Felicitas aeterna, inter se dixerunt, "nequaquam hoc veritas est; non potest tanta caligo, et talis stupor mentium Christianis esse; descendamus etiam nos, et audiamus num veritas sit, et si veritas est, sane est prodigium."</p><p>[2] Tunc Angeli illi dixerunt ad Angelum tubae, "nosti quod unusquisque homo, qui desideraverat Coelum, et aliquid certi cogitaverat de gaudiis ibi, post mortem introducatur in imaginationis suae gaudia; et quod postquam experti sunt, qualia illa gaudia sunt, quod sint secundum vanas ideas mentis, et secundum deliria phantasiae illorum, educantur ab illis et instruantur; hoc fit plerisque in Mundo Spirituum, qui in priore vita meditati sunt de Coelo, et concluserunt aliquid de gaudiis ibi usque ad horum desiderium." His auditis, Angelus tubae dixit ad sex Cohortes ex Sapientibus Orbis Christiani convocatas, "sequimini me, et introducam vos in gaudia vestra, ita in Coelum." </p>
