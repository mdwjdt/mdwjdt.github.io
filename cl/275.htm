<h4 align="center"></h4><p>275、⑷然而，若缺乏联结夫妻心智的内在情感，这类婚姻会在家中解体。之所以说在家中，是因为这一切是在夫妻之间私下里发生的。当订婚之时点燃、婚礼之时迸发的最初火焰，由于内在情感的差异逐渐熄灭，最终被冷淡取而代之时，这种情形就会出现。众所周知，这时，牵引并诱使他们结婚的外在情感已经破碎，以致它们无法再将二人联结起来。我在前一章已证实，造成冷淡的因素各种各样，既有内在的，也有外在的，还有偶然的，所有这些因素都源于内在倾向的不同之处。由此明显可知，若外在情感中没有联结夫妻心智的内在情感，这类婚姻会在家中解体。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #275 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>275. (iv) But in the absence of inward affections to link a couple's minds, such marriages fall apart at home.<p>We say at home, because this takes place between the couple in private. This happens when the early warmth created at the time of an engagement, which bursts into flame at the time of the wedding, afterwards by stages loses its zest on account of their ill-matched inward affections, so that finally it is replaced with coldness. It is well known that the outward affections which induced and enticed them to get married disappear, so that they no longer link them. I proved in the last chapter that coldness arises for various reasons, inward, outward and accidental, all of them derived from unlikeness in inward inclinations. This makes plain the truth of the proposition, that in the absence of inward affections to link a couple's minds, such marriages fall apart at home. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #275 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>275. 4. If inward affections that join the partners' minds are not present, however, the marriages come apart in the home. We say, in the home, because it takes place in private between them. It happens with the disappearance of their initial feelings of warmth, ignited at the time of their engagement and burning at the approach of their wedding, as these afterwards gradually die down because of the difference in their inward affections and finally vanish into states of coldness. People know that the outward affections which once induced and enticed them into marrying are then cast aside, so as to no longer join the two.<p>We already established in the previous chapter that cold states arise for a variety of internal, external and incidental reasons - all of which draw their origins from a dissimilarity in inward inclinations.<p>This makes plain the truth, that unless outward affections have present in them inner affections that join the partners' minds, marriages come apart in the home. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #275 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>275. 4. But without deeper feelings that join the minds together, the marriage ties loosen in the home. We say in the home because it is a personal matter. It happens because the fires kindled in courtship and blazing on the wedding day gradually cool down afterwards and finally turn cold on account of differences in the people's inner dispositions. Then, as we know, the superficial motives that led and lured them into marriage diverge and no longer keep the couple together.<p>The previous chapter demonstrated that all the different causes of coldness - internal, external, and contingent - well up from differences in inner dispositions. So it is clearly the truth: unless inward feelings within the surface ones join the minds together, the marriage ties in the home come untied. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #275 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>275. IV. BUT THAT IF INTERNAL AFFECTIONS WHICH CONJOIN MINDS ARE NOT WITHIN THEM, MATRIMONIES ARE DISSOLVED IN THE HOME--it is said in the home because it is between the partners privately. This comes to pass when the first fires, kindled at the time of betrothal and flaming at the time of the wedding, gradually cool down on account of a discrepancy in internal affections, and finally pass off into cold. That the external affections which led and allured them into matrimony are then sundered so that they no longer conjoin, is well known. That cold arises from various causes, internal, external, and accidental, all of which derive their stream from a dissimilitude of internal inclinations, has been confirmed in the preceding chapter. From this the truth is evident that unless within the external affections there are internal affections which conjoin minds, matrimonies are dissolved in the home. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #275 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>275. (iv) But if internal affections are not present, conjoining the minds, the bond of matrimony is loosed in the house. We say, "in the house," because privately between the partners. This takes place when the first fires kindled at the time of betrothal and flaming when the nuptials are at hand, afterwards grow successively less ardent on account of the disparity in the internal affections, and finally pass away into cold. It is common knowledge that the external affections which led and allured to matrimony are then sundered so as no longer to conjoin the partners. We established the fact in the chapter above that colds arise from various causes, internal, external and accessory, and that all these causes derive their influence from unlikeness of the internal affections. The truth is plain from this that unless internal affections, conjoining the minds, are present in external, the bond of matrimony is loosed in the house. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #275 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>275. (4) But that if there are not internal affections within, which conjoin the minds, matrimony is loosened in the house. It is said in the house, because it is between them privately. This comes to pass when the first fires, kindled at the time of betrothal and burning into a flame as the nuptials approach, afterwards, on account of discordance of internal affections grow successively less ardent, and finally pass away into cold. It is known that then the external affections, which led and lured them into matrimony, are sundered so that they no longer conjoin. That colds arise from various causes, internal, external, and adventitious, which all derive their streamlets from the dissimilitude of internal inclinations, has been confirmed in the preceding chapter. From this the truth is evident, that if there are not internal affections within the external, which conjoin the minds (mentes), matrimony is loosened in the house. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #275 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>275. IV: Sed quod si non internae affectiones, quae conjungunt mentes, insunt, matrimonia in domo solvantur; dicitur in domo, quia privatim inter illos; quod fit, dum primi calores accensi tempore desponsationis, et flagrantes dum instant nuptiae, successive postea propter discrepantiam affectionum internarum, defervescunt, et demum abeunt in frigora; quod tunc affectiones externae, quae induxerunt et allectaverunt illos ad matrimonium, disparentur, ut nec amplius conjungant, notum est. Quod frigora oboriantur ex variis causis internis, externis, et accidentalibus, quae omnes ex dissimilitudine internarum inclinationum trahunt rivos, in superiore Capite confirmatum est. Ex his patet veritas, quod nisi externis affectionibus insunt internae, quae conjungunt mentes, matrimonia in domo solvantur. </p>
