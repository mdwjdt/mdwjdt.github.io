<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第26节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>26、我再次郑重声明，这些事、这些话都是真的，和我讲述的一样。头几件事发生在灵人界，灵人界在天堂和地狱之间。后来的几件事发生在手拿号筒、充当向导的天使所属的天堂社群。若非主乐意开启某个人的灵眼，向他展示这些事，并教导他，基督教界有谁会知道天堂及其快乐和幸福（这些知识也是救赎的知识）呢？这类事发生在灵界的佐证，从使徒约翰的所见所闻（如启示录描述的那样）清楚可知。如，他描述了以下见闻：<br><br>人子在七个灯台中间。（启示录1：12，13）<br><br>天堂的帐幕、圣殿、约柜和祭坛。（启示录15：5，8；11：19；6：9；8：3；9：13）<br><br>封有七印的书卷，书卷打开，有马匹从里面出来。（启示录5：1；6：1，2，4，5，8）<br><br>四个活物围着宝座。（启示录4：6）<br><br>每个支派选出一万二千。（启示录7:4-8）<br><br>蝗虫从深渊出来。（启示录9:3，7）<br><br>龙及它与米迦勒的争战。（启示录12:7）<br><br>妇人生了一个孩子，由于龙而逃到旷野。（启示录12:1，2，5，6）<br><br>两个兽，一个从海中上来，一个从地中上来。（启示录13:1，11）<br><br>一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上。（启示录17:3）<br><br>龙被扔在硫磺的火湖里。（启示录20:3，10）<br><br>白马及大筵席。（启示录19:11，17）<br><br>一个新天新地，圣城耶路撒冷降临，以及对它的城门、城墙、地基的描述。（启示录21:1，2，12，14，17-20）<br><br>一道生命水的河，每月都结果子的生命树。（启示录22:1，2）<br><br>除此之外的很多其它事，全都是约翰在灵里看到的，有些发生在灵界，有些发生在天堂。此外，还有主复活后使徒和后来彼得看到的事，以及保罗的所见所闻。另外，一些先知也见过异象。如，以西结看到：<br><br>四个活物，就是基路伯。（以西结书1章、10章）<br><br>新圣殿和新地，天使在仗量它们。（以西结书40-48章）<br><br>他被带到耶路撒冷，在那里看到可憎的事，被带进迦勒底地，到被掳的人那里。（以西结书8章、11章）<br><br>撒迦利亚书也有类似经历，他看到：<br><br>一人骑马站在洼地番石榴树中间。（撒迦利亚书1：8）<br><br>四角，然后一人手拿准绳。（撒迦利亚书1：18，2：1）<br><br>一个灯台，两棵橄榄树。（撒迦利亚书4：1）<br><br>一飞行的书卷，一个量器（撒迦利亚书5：1，6）<br><br>四驾马车从两座山中间出来，以及它们的马匹。（撒迦利亚书6：1）<br><br>但以理书同样看到：<br><br>四兽从海中上来。（但以理书7：1）<br><br>公山羊和公绵羊之间的战斗。（但以理书8：1）<br><br>他与天使加百列谈了很长时间。（但以理书9章）<br><br>少年人以利沙看见火车火马围绕他；当他的眼目开了后，就看见这些事物。（列王纪下6：17）<br><br>由上述和其它经文清楚可知，主降世前后，很多人看到过发生在灵界的事。当一个教会即将建立，新耶路撒冷由主那里从天而降时，同样的事发生在今天又有什么奇怪呢？</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>26、我再一次声明上述一切是真实的，起初发生的是在精神世界中，它处于天堂和地狱的中间，接下来的是在天堂中，带喇叭的天使就是从其中来的。</p><p>除了主向一些人展现这些以外，基督教界中有谁会了解天国之乐及那里的幸福呢？</p><p>在《启示录》中记载的使徒约翰的见闻证实了在精神世界中发生的事情。例如，约翰描述了以下的情形：</p><p>人子站在七个灯台中间。</p><p>一个祭坛、殿堂、方舟以及天堂中的祭坛。</p><p>一本书由七个印封着，书打开了，马从里面出来。</p><p>四种活物围着宝座。</p><p>每个部落出一万二千。</p><p>蝗虫从坑中飞出。</p><p>龙及它与米迦勒的争战。</p><p>一个妇众生了个男孩，之后逃到旷野中去。</p><p>二个野兽，一个从海中来，一个从地中来。</p><p>一个女人坐在朱红色的兽上。</p><p>龙被扔到硫磺的火湖里。</p><p>白马及大筵席。</p><p>一个新天新地，圣城耶路撒冷降临，以及对它的门，墙及地基的描述。</p><p>有着生命水的河，每月结果的生命树。</p><p>还有许多事物都是约翰在精神世界和天堂中所见到的。这也是使徒们在主复活之后所见到的。这些在后来也被彼得，保罗所见到。</p><p>另外，还有先知们所见到的事物。例如，以西结看到以下情景：</p><p>四个活物，他们是小天使（以西结1及10）</p><p>新的殿和土地、天使在仗量它。（以西结40-48）</p><p>被抬到耶路撒冷，看到可恶的情象。（以西结8），他还被抬到迦勒底，到被囚禁的人那里（以西结11）</p><p>类似的事情也发生在撒迦利身上：</p><p>他看到一个人骑马走在番石榴树中间。（撒迦利亚1:8）</p><p>他看到四个角，以及一个人手拿准绳。（撒迦利亚1:18，2:1）</p><p>他看到一个灯台及两棵橄榄树。（撒迦利亚4:1）</p><p>他看飞行的书卷及一个量器（撒迦利亚5:1，6）</p><p>他看到四驾马车从两座山中间出来（撒迦利亚6:1）</p><p>但以礼也经历了类似的事情：</p><p>他看到四个大兽从海上来（但以礼7:1）</p><p>他还看到与他交谈很久的天使加百利（但以礼9）</p><p>另外以利沙的青年睁开眼睛后看到火车火马围绕着他。</p><p>从这些以及圣经其它的段落中，很清楚，精神世界中的现象曾展现给好多人。那它们现在展现给我们又有什么奇怪呢？教会开始形成，新耶路撒冷将从主的天堂中降临。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #26 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>26. I repeat my solemn declaration that these events took place and these things were said as reported, the earlier ones in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and the later ones in the heavenly community to which the angel with the trumpet belongs, who was my guide. Would anyone in Christendom have known anything about heaven and its joys and happiness, the knowledge of which is the same as the knowledge of salvation, if it had not been the Lord's pleasure to open up the sight of someone's spirit and show and instruct him? It is perfectly plain that this kind of thing happens in the spiritual world from what was seen and heard by the Apostle John, as described in the Book of Revelation. <p>For instance, he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lamp-stands [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>]; <p>the tabernacle, temple, ark and altar in heaven [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_5.htm">Revelation 15:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_11_19.htm">11:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_9.htm">6:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_3.htm">8:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_13.htm">9:13</a>]; <p>the book sealed with seven seals, its opening and the horses coming out of it [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_4.htm">4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_8.htm">8</a>]; <p>the four beasts around the throne [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>]; <p>the twelve thousand chosen from each tribe [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_4.htm">Revelation 7:4-8</a>]; <p>the locusts coming up from the abyss [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_7.htm">7</a>]; <p>the dragon and its battle with Michael [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>]; <p>the woman who bore a male child and who fled unto the desert because of the dragon [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1-2</a>, ]; <p>the two beasts, one coming up from the sea, the other from the land [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a>]; <p>the woman sitting on the scarlet beast [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>]; <p>the dragon cast out into a pool of fire and brimstone [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_10.htm">10</a>]; <p>the white horse and the great feast [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_17.htm">17</a>]; <p>the new heaven and the new earth, and the holy Jerusalem coming down with the description of its gates, wall and the foundations of the wall [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_17.htm">17-20</a>]; <p>and the river of the water of life, and the trees of life that bear fruit every month [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>]. <p>There are many other things too all of which John saw, when he was in the spirit in the spiritual world and in heaven. Moreover, there are the things seen by the Apostles after the Lord's resurrection, and later by Peter (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">Acts of the Apostles 11</a>), as well as seen and heard by Paul.<p>There are too the visions of the prophets. For instance, Ezekiel saw the four beasts which were cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>); <p>the new temple and the new earth and the angel measuring them (chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_41_1.htm">41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_44_1.htm">44</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_45_1.htm">45</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_46_1.htm">46</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">47</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>); <p>his being taken off to Jerusalem and seeing abominations there, and being taken to Chaldea into captivity (chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_1.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11</a>). <p>Zechariah had similar experiences; he saw a man riding among the myrtles (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> ff); four horns, and then a man, carrying in his hand a measuring-line (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2</a>); <p>a lamp-stand and two olive trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4</a>); <p>a flying scroll and a barrel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); <p>four chariots coming from between two mountains, and their horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6</a>). <p>Equally Daniel saw four beasts coming up from the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7</a>); <p>the fighting between the ram and the he-goat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8</a>); <p>the angel Gabriel with whom he had a long conversation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_1.htm">Daniel 9</a>). <p>Elisha's boy saw chariots and horses of fire around Elisha; and he saw these when his eyes had been opened [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>].<p>It is clear from these and many other passages in the Word that the things which come about in the spiritual world have been seen by many both before and after the Lord's coming. Is it surprising that the same has happened now too, when a church is starting up, and the New Jerusalem is coming down from the Lord out of heaven? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #26 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>26. Again I swear in truth that these events and words occurred as I have related them, the first ones in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and the subsequent ones in a society of heaven, the society from which came the angel with the trumpet, who acted as guide.<p>Who in the Christian world would know anything about heaven and the joys and happiness there - knowledge of which is also knowledge of salvation - unless it pleased the Lord to open to someone the sight of his spirit and to show him and teach him?<p>Corroboration that things like these occur in the spiritual world appears plainly from the things seen and heard by the apostle John, as described in the book of Revelation. For example, he describes having seen the following:<p>The Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands. <sup >1</sup><p>A tabernacle, temple, ark, and altar in heaven. <sup >2</sup><p>A book sealed with seven seals. The book opened, and horses going out of it. <sup >3</sup><p>Four living creatures around a throne. <sup >4</sup><p>Twelve thousand taken from each tribe. <sup >5</sup><p>Locusts arising out of the abyss. <sup >6</sup><p>A dragon and its fight with Michael. <sup >7</sup><p>A woman giving birth to a male child and fleeing into the wilderness because of the dragon. <sup >8</sup><p>Two beasts, one rising up out of the sea, the other out of the earth. <sup >9</sup><p>A woman sitting on a scarlet beast. <sup >10</sup><p>The dragon cast into a lake of fire and brimstone. <sup >11</sup><p>A white horse, and a great supper. <sup >12</sup><p>A new heaven and a new earth, and the holy Jerusalem coming down, described as to its gates, wall, and foundations. <sup >13</sup><p>Also a river of water of life, and trees of life yielding fruits every month. <sup >14</sup><p>Besides many other things, all of which were seen by John, and seen when he was in the spirit <sup >15</sup>in the spiritual world and in heaven. In addition, those things which were seen by the apostles after the Lord's resurrection. <sup >16</sup>And which were later seen by Peter (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">Acts of the Apostles 11</a>). <sup >17</sup>Also which were then seen and heard by Paul. <sup >18</sup><p>Moreover, there were the things seen by the prophets. For example, Ezekiel saw the following:<p>Four living creatures, which were cherubs. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>)<p>A new temple and a new earth, and an angel measuring them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>-<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>)<p>Being carried off to Jerusalem, he saw the abominations there. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_1.htm">Ezekiel 8</a>) And he was also carried off into Chaldea, to those in captivity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11</a>) <sup >19</sup><p>Something similar happened with Zechariah:<p>He saw a man riding among myrtle trees. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> ff.)<p>He saw four horns, and then a man with a measuring line in his hand. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a> ff., <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a> ff.)<p>He saw a lampstand and two olive trees. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a> ff.)<p>He saw a flying scroll, and an ephah. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>)<p>He saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, with horses. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a> ff.)<p>Likewise with Daniel:<p>He saw four beasts come up from the sea. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a> ff.)<p>Also the combats of a ram and a goat.

<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #26 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>26. Again I affirm in truth that I have told these things just the way they were done and said. The first part happened in the world of spirits, which is between heaven and hell, and the subsequent ones in a community of heaven where the angel with the trumpet, who was their guide, came from.<p>Who in the Christian world would have known anything about heaven and the joys and happiness there (knowledge of it is also knowledge of salvation) unless it had pleased the Lord to open the sight of someone's spirit for him and show and teach him?<p>It is clear from the things that the Apostle John saw and heard that things like this exist in the spiritual world. He described them in Revelation. For example, he saw the Son of man among the seven candlesticks; a tabernacle, a temple, an ark, and an altar in the sky; a book, sealed with seven seals, opened, and horses going out of it; four animals around a throne; twelve thousand people chosen from each tribe; locusts swarming out of an abyss; the dragon and his war with Michael; a woman who bore a male son fleeing into the wilderness because of the dragon; two beasts, one rising out of the sea, and the other out of the earth; a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast; a dragon thrown into a pool of fire and brimstone; a white horse and a big dinner; a new sky and a new earth, and the holy Jerusalem descending (he describes its gates, its wall, and its foundation); and a river of the water of life, and trees of life bearing fruit every month.<p>And there were other things. John saw all these things when he was in the spiritual world and in heaven, so far as his spirit was concerned.<p>In addition, there are the things the Apostles saw after the Lord's resurrection, and what Peter saw later (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">Acts of the Apostles 11</a>), and what Paul saw and heard.<p>Besides these things, there are the things the prophets saw.<p>Ezekiel, for example, saw four creatures that were cherubs (Ezek.<p>1. and 10); a new temple and a new land, and an angel measuring them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> - <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>).

He saw a man riding among myrtle trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>ff.). He saw four horns, and then a man with a measuring line in his hand <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">1:18-21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>ff.}. He saw a candlestick and two olive trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_2.htm">4:2</a>ff.). He saw a flying scroll and a measuring basket (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">5:1-6</a>). He saw four chariots, and horses, coming out from between two mountains (6:lff.).<p>The same for Daniel. He saw four beasts coming up out of the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>ff.), and a fight between a ram and a he - goat<p>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>ff.). He saw the angel Gabriel and spoke with him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_20.htm">9:20</a>ff.).<p>Elisha's servant saw chariots and horses on fire around Elisha.<p>He saw them with his eyes wide open (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>These and many other things in the Word show that the things that exist in the spiritual world have appeared to many people before and after the Lord's advent.

And likewise with Daniel, who saw four beasts coming up out of the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>, seq.); and a fight between a ram and a he-goat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>, seq.); and saw and spoke much with the angel Gabriel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>, seq.). And the servant of Elisha saw chariots and horses of fire round about Elisha, and saw them when his eyes were opened (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). From these and many other things in the Word it is evident that the things which exist in the spiritual world appeared to many before and after the Lord's advent. Why wonder that they should appear now also, at the beginning of a church, or at the descent of the New Jerusalem from the Lord out of heaven?' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #26 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>26. Iterum in veritate assevero, quod haec, sicut memorata sunt, facta et dicta sint, priora in Mundo Spirituum, qui medius est inter Coelum et Infernum, et sequentia haec in Societate Coeli, e qua fuit Angelus tubae et ductor. Quis in Christiano Orbe aliquid scivisset de Coelo, ac de Gaudiis et de Felicitate ibi, quorum scientia est quoque scientia salutis, nisi placuerit Domino aperire alicui visum spiritus ejus, ac monstrare et docere. Quod similia existant in Mundo spirituali, patet manifeste ex visis et auditis Apostolo Johanni, quae descripta sunt in Apocalypsi, ut quod viderit Filium hominis in medio septem Candelabrorum, Tabernaculum, Templum, Arcam, Altare in Coelo; Librum obsignatum septem sigillis, illum apertum, et inde exeuntes Equos; quatuor Animalia circa Thronum; duodecim millia electos ex unaquavis Tribu; Locustas ascendentes ex abysso; Draconem et ejus pugnam cum Michaele; Mulierem parientem filium masculum, ac fugientem in desertum propter Draconem; duas Bestias, unam ascendentem ex mari, alteram e terra; Mulierem sedentem super Bestia Coccinea; Draconem ejectum in stagnum ignis et sulphuris; Equum album, et Coenam Magnam; Coelum novum et Terram novam, ac Sanctam Hierosolymam descendentem, descriptam <sup>1</sup>quoad Portas, Murum et hujus Fundamenta; tum Fluvium aquae vitae, et Arbores vitae facientes fructus quovis mense; praeter plura, quae omnia visa sunt Johanni, ac visa dum quoad spiritum fuit in Mundo spirituali et in Coelo.
