<h4 align="center"></h4><p>374、在有些情况下，嫉妒缘于各种心理疾病，这在世上并非秘密。因为有些嫉妒的男人总感觉妻子不忠，仅仅听见或看见妻子与男人友好交谈或谈论男人，就认为她们是妓女。有许多心理缺陷会导致这种病症，其中第一个就是幻想的怀疑。若长此以往，这会把心智带入同类灵人的社群，致使心智仅仅从中抽身就很困难。这种幻想的怀疑还会在身体中强化自己，导致血清和血液变得黏稠、黏性、稠密、流动缓慢和发酸。此外，它会因缺乏性能力而加剧，这使得心智不能被提升到它的猜疑之上；因为性能力的存在会提升心智，性能力的缺乏则会压抑心智。这种缺乏会造成心智消沉、崩溃和憔悴。然后，心智越发沉浸于这种幻想，直到发疯。这种疯狂的发泄口就是以责骂为乐，若可以，还会以肆无忌惮的诋毁为乐。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #374 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>374. It is by no means unknown in the world that in some cases jealousy is the result of various kinds of mental illness. For jealous people are to be found who continually dwell on their wives' infidelity, and have only to hear or see them engaged in friendly conversation with men or about men to believe them to be whores.<p>There are a lot of mental defects which cause that illness, but the chief part is played by imaginary suspicion, which, if long nurtured, brings the mind into communities of similar spirits, from where it is difficult to extract it. This imaginary suspicion also strengthens itself in the body, causing the serum and hence the blood to become viscous, sticky, thick, slow-moving and acid. A loss of strength also increases it, for this prevents the mind rising above the suspicions it harbours. For the presence of strength exalts the mind, its absence depresses it. This makes the mind sink, collapse and become weak; and it then plunges more and more into that imaginary suspicion, until it becomes demented. The result of this is to take pleasure in quarrelling and unrestrained vilification. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #374 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>374. With respect to the jealousness arising in some owing to a sickness of the mind of one kind or another, that this happens is not unknown in the world. For there are jealous men who continually think of their wives as being unfaithful, and who regard them as loose women if they but hear or see them speaking in a friendly way with men or about men.<p>There are many impairments of the mind which induce such a sickness. Chief among these is a suspicious imagination, which, if fed long, introduces the mind into societies of like spirits, from which it can only with difficulty be withdrawn. It establishes itself in the body as well, by causing the body's fluid and thus the blood to become viscous, sticky, thick, sluggish, and caustic. A failure of the virile powers further increases it, for this renders the mind incapable of being lifted up out of its suspicious fantasies. For the mind is uplifted by the presence of the virile powers, and cast down by their absence, their absence causing the mind to fall, crumple, and become limp. And the mind then becomes more and more immersed in its fantasy, until it goes mad - a madness which has its outlet in a delight of making accusations, and to the extent it is permitted, of hurling vituperations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #374 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>374. It is no secret in the world that some people's jealousy is from various mental afflictions, for there are jealous men who constantly think that their wives are unfaithful and believe that they are prostitutes just from hearing or seeing that they talk in a friendly way with men or about men. There are several mental defects that bring on this affliction. Suspicious fantasy takes first place among them. If cherished very long, this brings your mind into communities of similar spirits whom it can hardly be removed from. It also sets in on your body, which makes the serum, and therefore the blood, sticky, tenacious, thick, slow, and acrid. Lack of potency aggravates it, too, for this makes your mind unable to be raised out of its suspicions. The presence of potency raises it, and its absence depresses it, for it makes your mind droop, crumble, and wither, and then it plunges into this fantasy more and more until it is crazy. And this comes out as a delight in rebukes and in abuse as much as is allowed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #374 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>374. That with some, jealousy is from various mental sicknesses is no secret in the world; for there are jealous men who continually think of their wives as unfaithful, believing them to be harlots, and this merely on hearing or seeing that they talk amicably with men or about men. There are mental blemishes which induce this infirmity, the first among which is a suspicious fantasy. If long cherished, this brings the mind into societies of like spirits, from which it can be delivered only with difficulty. Jealousy also gives itself added strength in the body, by the serum and thence the blood becoming viscous, tenacious, thick, sluggish, and acrid. Moreover, it is augmented by lack of the virile powers, this rendering the mind unable to be raised above its suspicion; for their presence elevates, and their absence depresses, this absence causing the mind to droop, collapse and languish. It then immerses itself in that fantasy ever more and more until it becomes insane; and this insanity has its outlet in the delight of upbraiding and, so far as allowed, of reviling. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #374 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>374. The world is not unaware that with some men jealousy arises from various sicknesses of mind. There are jealous men who are constantly thinking that their wives are unfaithful; if they only hear or see them speak in a friendly way with or about men, they believe them to be harlots. Many flaws of mind induce this morbidity, among which a suspicious fancy holds the first place, which, when long cherished, bears the mind into societies of similar spirits, whence it can be rescued with difficulty. This morbidity also establishes itself in the body, as a result of which the serum and thus the blood turn viscous, tenacious, thick, sluggish and acrid. Loss of virility aggravates it, not letting the mind rise above its suspicions. For the presence of virility elevates and its absence depresses, causing the mind to droop, collapse and grow flaccid, whereupon it immerses itself more and more in that fancy until it is crazed; the result is indulgence in reproaches, and as far as allowed, in denunciations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #374 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>374. That with some jealousy is from a variety of infirmities of the mind is no secret in the world; for there are jealous men who are continually thinking of their wives that they are unfaithful, and believe them to be harlots if only they hear or see that they talk in a friendly way with men, or about men. There are various vitiated states of mind which induce this infirmity, first among which is a suspicious fantasy, which if long cherished brings the mind into societies of similar spirits, from which it is difficult to be brought out. It even settles itself in the body, by that the serum and thence the blood becomes viscous, tenacious, thick, sluggish, and acrid. Deficiency of strength also increases it, for it effects that. the mind cannot be raised above its suspicions. For the presence of strength elevates, and its absence depresses, because it brings to pass that the mind droops, collapses, and becomes relaxed, and then immerses itself into that fantasy more and more until it is delirious; and this results in the delight of reproaches, and as far as may be, of railing abuse. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #374 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>374. Quod apud quosdam Zelotypia sit ex varia aegritudine mentis, non latet in Mundo; dantur enim zelosi, qui continue cogitant de uxoribus quod sint infidae, et credunt illas scorta, modo audiunt aut vident quod amice loquantur cum viris aut de viris; sunt plura vitia mentis, quae inducunt illam aegritudinem, inter quae primas tenet phantasia suspiciosa, quae si diu alitur, infert mentem in societates spirituum similium, e quibus aegre potest eximi; firmat se etiam in corpore, per quod serum et inde sanguis fiat viscosus, tenax, spissus, lentus, acer; defectus virium etiam auget illam, nam hic facit, ut mens nequeat a suspiciosis suis elevari; praesentia virium enim elevat, et absentia illarum labefactat, nam haec facit ut mens decidat, collabatur, et flaccescat, et tunc phantasiae isti plus et plus se immergit, usque dum deliret, et hoc evadit in jucundum objurgationum, et quantum licet vituperationum. </p>
