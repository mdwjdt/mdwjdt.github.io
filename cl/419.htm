<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第419节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>419、“透过自然界的可见事物，谁都能确认赞成神性。如当他研究关于蜜蜂的知识时：蜜蜂知道如何从花草中采集蜂蜡、吸食花蜜；知道如何建造类似小房子的蜂室，并将它们布置成一座城市的样式，还有进出的街道；它们远远地就能嗅到花草的芳香，然后从中为房子采集蜂蜡、为食物采集花蜜，并满载这些东西，径直飞回自己的蜂巢。它们就这样为自己预备食物和居所，以度过即将来临的冬天，仿佛它们早就知道并有所预见。它们还立一个女王来管理它们，通过这个女主人繁衍后代；它们在上面为她建造一种宫殿，并有侍从围着她；分娩之际，她在侍从的陪伴下，逐个蜂室产卵，这些卵被跟随她的蜂群密封起来，免得遭到空气伤害；它们便从这些卵中获得新的后代。后来，这后代到了能重复上述过程的年龄，就从家里（即蜂巢）被逐出；被逐出的蜂群首先都聚集起来，结成一团，以免彼此失去联系；然后侦察蜂四处飞行、另觅家园。约在秋季时分，无用的雄蜂就被带出来，并被剥去翅膀，防止它们飞回来消耗食物，因为它们没有为这些食物劳力。还有更多类似现象，由此可见，鉴于蜜蜂对人类有用，所以它们凭来自灵界的流注而拥有某种类似世人，确切地说，类似天上天使的管理模式。<br><br>“凡理智未被损坏者，谁看不出蜜蜂当中的这类现象不可能出于自然界？太阳，就是自然界的源头，与效仿和类似天堂的管理模式有何共同之处呢？从这些低等生物所得来的这些及类似证据，既能使一个承认并敬拜自然界的人确认赞成自然界，也能使一个承认并敬拜神性的人确认赞成神性。因为属灵人在这些现象中看见属灵的结果，而属世人则看见属世的结果，各自取决于他的性质。至于我本人，这类证据见证了属灵之物流入属世之物，或说灵界流入自然界，因而见证了来自主的神性智慧的流入。试想一下，若无神性从祂的智慧经由灵界流入你们，你们还能否分析思考什么政府形式、世间法律、道德美德或属灵真理？至于我本人，过去不能，现在也不能。因为我一直在通过觉知和感受观察这种流注，现已持续了二十五年，从未间断。所以，我能凭亲身经历作此声明。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>419、从蜜蜂身上人们可以看到神性的存在，它们会知道到何处采蜜，建蜜巢，巢中有通道。它们会感知花粉所在的方向，去采蜜然后径直飞回来，它们会储备食物，为冬天做准备，它们还会找到蜂王来繁衍后代，建起一种象宫中一样的等级。工蜂会帮蜂王将卵存在安全的地方。等下一代出世后，它们会被从蜂巢中赶出去去构建它们自己的王国。因为蜂给人类的有益的服务，所以它们被赋予一种与人类社会相似的形状。或者说与天国中天使的社会相似的形式。</p><p>任何头脑健全的人都会知道以上现象不是自然的原因。自然界的太阳怎么会产生与天国社会相似的形式？</p><p>精神性的人会在以上现象中看到神，而自然倾向的人会只看到自然。</p><p>对于我自己来说，这些现象是从精神世界流入到自然界中的证据，是来自于主的神圣智慧的。</p><p>无论你是分析各种形式的政体，任何法律，任何道德以及精神性真理，没有来自于神的智慧，这些是不可能的。我深深意识到这点并从个人经历讲了这些内容。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #419 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>419. 'Anyone can convince himself in favour of the divine by observing nature, when he studies what is known about bees. They know how to collect wax from grasses and flowers, and to suck up honey; how to build cells as little houses, and arrange them so as to make a city with streets through which they can come and go. They can smell at a distance the flowers and grasses from which they collect wax for building and honey for food, and laden with these fly back on the right heading for their hive. Thus they provide themselves with food and dwelling for the coming winter, as if they knew this and could foresee it. They set over themselves a mistress or queen, from whom their offspring are propagated; and they construct for her a sort of court up above, with attendants around it. When it is time to give birth, she goes accompanied by her attendants from one cell to another, laying eggs which the crowd of followers seals in to prevent them being harmed by the air. This is how their new generation is produced. Then later, when this reaches the adult stage so as to be able to do likewise, it is thrown out of the hive. The swarm thrown out first of all gathers together, and then in a squadron to avoid losing touch with one another, flies off to find itself another home. About autumn time the useless drones are brought out, and deprived of their wings, to prevent them returning and eating up food which they have done nothing to provide. And there are many more facts, from which it can be established that they have, on account of their usefulness to the human race, as a result of influence coming from the spiritual world the same kind of government as human beings on earth, or rather of angels in heaven.<p>Can anyone whose reason is not impaired fail to see that such things among bees cannot come from the natural world? What has the sun, the origin of nature, in common with a government parallel to and virtually that of heaven? These and similar arguments drawn from the lower animals can lead one who admits and worships nature to convince himself in favour of nature, and one who admits and worships God to convince himself in favour of the Divine. For a spiritual person sees spiritual effects in these, and a natural person natural effects, each according to what he is. For my part, such arguments were evidence of the influence of the spiritual on the natural, or of the spiritual world on the natural world, that is, produced by the Lord's Divine wisdom.<p>Consider too whether you can think analytically about any form of government, or any civil law, or any moral virtue, or any spiritual truth, without the Divine influencing you from His wisdom by means of the spiritual world. I can answer for myself that I have not been and am not able to do so. For I have noted my perception and feeling of this influence for the last twenty-five years continually, so I make this statement from personal experience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #419 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>419. Everyone can, from the visible phenomena in nature, confirm himself on the side of the Divine when he considers what is known about bees: that they know how to gather wax and extract honey from herbs and flowers, and to construct cells resembling little houses and arrange them into the pattern of a city, with streets by which to go in and out; that they detect from a distance the fragrance of the flowers and herbs from which they gather wax for their home and honey for their food, and laden with these fly back in a direct line to their hive; thus providing for themselves food and habitation for the coming winter, as though they were aware of it and foresaw it. They also set over them a dominant female as queen by which to propagate their posterity; and for her they build a court above, with attendants surrounding her. When the time comes for her to deliver, she goes accompanied by her attendants from cell to cell and lays her eggs, which are sealed up by the swarm following her to protect them from the air. From these they produce a new generation. Later, when the new generation has advanced to the appropriate age to be able to do the like, it is expelled from the nest; and having been expelled, the horde first gathers itself, and in a swarm therefore to keep the assemblage from being scattered, flies away (then) to seek (out) for itself a home. Around the time of autumn, moreover, the useless drones are taken out and divested of their wings, to keep them from returning and consuming the colony's food, for which they have expended no effort. And many other phenomena as well; from which it can be seen that, because of the useful service which bees perform for the human race, they have by virtue of an influx from the spiritual world a form of government such as is found among human beings on earth, indeed among angels in heaven.<p>What person who has his reason intact does not see that such phenomena in these creatures are not owing to the natural world? The sun from which nature emanates - what characteristic does it have in common with a government imitative of and analogous to the government of heaven?<p>From these and...like phenomena in the case of brute animals, the proponent and worshiper of nature confirms himself on the side of nature, while the proponent and worshiper of God, from the same phenomena, confirms himself on the side of the Divine. For a spiritual person sees spiritual effects in them, and the natural person sees natural ones - thus each such things as accord with his character.<p>As for myself, to me phenomena of this sort have been evidences of an influx of the spiritual realm into the natural, or of the spiritual world into the natural world, emanating thus from the Lord's Divine wisdom.<p>Consider, too, whether you could think in an analytical manner about any form of government, any civil law, any moral virtue, or any spiritual truth, if something Divine did not flow in from His wisdom through the spiritual world. For my part, I could not and cannot. For I have been consciously and sensibly aware of that influx (for twenty-five years) now without interruption. Therefore I speak from personal experience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #419 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>419. "From things seen in nature, anyone can confirm himself in favor of Divinity, when he considers what is known about bees that they know how to collect wax and suck honey from plants and flowers, and build cells like little houses and arrange them in the form of a city with streets that they go in and out by. From a distance they smell the flowers and plants that they collect the wax from for their home and the honey for food, and loaded with these they fly back to their hive 'by the compass.' In this way they provide food and lodging for the coming winter just as if they knew about it and foresaw it. And they place a leader over them like a queen, who propagates offspring. And they build her a sort of palace above them, with servants around her. When the time comes for offspring, she goes from cell to cell accompanied by servants and lays eggs, which the crowd of followers seal up to keep the air from injuring them. This provides new progeny. Later, when they are old enough to do the same thing, they are driven from home, and the expelled crowd collects and forms a swarm so as not to break up the group. Then it flies away to find itself a home. And about autumn they bring the useless drones out and take away their wings to keep them from coming back and eating their food, which they expended no labor on. And other things.<p>You can conclude from all this that, for the use they perform for the human race, these bees have a form of kingdom, due to influence from the spiritual world, as among men on earth, and, in fact, among angels in heaven.<p>"What person with sound reason fails to see that they do not get these things from the natural world? What does the sun that nature comes from have in common with a government that copies, and is the analogue of, the government of heaven?<p>"From these and similar things in the lower animals, the one who avows and worships nature confirms himself in favor of nature, while the one who avows and worships God confirms himself in favor of God by them, for the spiritual person sees spiritual things in them, and the worldly person sees worldly things in them, so to each his own.<p>"As for me, things like this have been witnesses to me of the influence of the spiritual in the natural, or the spiritual world in the natural world, thus the Lord's Divine Wisdom. And consider whether you can think analytically of any form of government or any civil law, or any moral virtue, or any spiritual truth unless Divinity is radiating through the spiritual world by His wisdom.<p>As for me, I cannot and never could, for I have been noticeably and sensibly aware of that influence, steadily, for twenty - five years now. So I say this as a witness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #419 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>419. "From the visible things in nature, every one can confirm himself in favor of the Divine when he takes note of What is known concerning bees; that they know how to collect wax and suck honey from herbs and flowers; to build cells like little houses, and to arrange them into the form of a city with streets through which they come and go; that they scent from afar the flowers and herbs from which they collect wax for their house and honey for their food, and laden with these, fly back in a direct line to their hive. Thus they provide for themselves food and dwelling for the coming winter as though they had knowledge and foresight. They also set over them as queen, a mistress by whom a posterity may be propagated; and for her, they build above them a kind of palace with attendants round about it; and when the time of bringing forth is at hand, then, accompanied by her attendants, she goes from cell to cell and lays her eggs; and lest these be injured by the air, they are besmeared all around by the crowd that follows her; and from these eggs they obtain a new progeny. Later, when this progeny has come to an age able to do the same things, it is driven from the home; and the swarm thus driven out, first gathers itself together and then, in a compact body lest the company be scattered, it flies off to seek for itself a domicile. Moreover, about autumn, the useless drones are led out and deprived of their wings lest they return and consume the food on which they have expended no labor; besides many other marvels. From all this it can be seen that because of the use they perform to the human race, and by virtue of influx out of the spiritual world, bees have a form of government like that which is among men on earth, yea, among angels in heaven. What man is there of unimpaired reason who does not see that such operations among bees are not from the natural world? What has the sun, the source of nature, in common with a government emulous of the government of heaven and analogous thereto?<p>"From the above and from similar marvels with brute animals, the confessor and worshipper of nature confirms himself in favor of nature, while, from the same things, the confessor and worshipper of God confirms himself in favor of the Divine, the spiritual man seeing in them spiritual things, and the natural man seeing in them natural things, each seeing in accordance With his nature. As regards myself, to me such things have been testimonies of the influx of the spiritual into the natural, that is, of the spiritual world into the natural world, thus of influx from the Lord's Divine wisdom. Reflect also on this: Is it possible for you to think analytically concerning any form of government, or any civil law or moral virtue or spiritual truth, unless the Divine from His wisdom flow in through the spiritual world? As to myself, it has not been possible, nor is it, for both by perception and by sensation, I have observed that influx, and this now for twenty-five years continuously. Therefore I say this as one who has witnessed it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #419 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>419. "Every one can confirm himself in favor of the Divine from things to be seen in nature, if he considers what is known about bees.

They also place over them a mistress as queen, from whom a posterity is propagated, and build her as it were a palace over themselves, with guards around it. She, when her time to bring forth is at hand, goes with her attendants from cell to cell and lays her eggs, which the crowd of retainers seal up to protect them from the air. Thence comes to them a new progeny. Later, when this progeny has arrived at an age to do the like, it is driven from the hive. The swarm so expelled first collects, and then in a band in order not to be scattered, flies off to seek a home for itself. In the autumn also the useless drones are brought out and deprived of their wings, so that they may not return and consume the food on which they bestowed no labor; not to mention other particulars. From all this it can be seen that for the sake of the use which they perform to the human race, bees have by influx from the spiritual world a form of government such as men on earth have, yes, such as the angels in heaven have. What man of unimpaired reason does not see that such phenomena in the life of bees are not from the natural world? What does the sun from which nature originates, have in common with a government emulating and analogous to heavenly government? From these and similar facts in animal life, the confessor and worshiper of nature confirms himself in favor of nature; while the confessor and worshiper of God confirms himself from the same evidence in favor of the Divine, for the spiritual man sees spiritual things in them, and the natural man sees natural things in them, each according to what he is. As for myself, such things have been testimonies to me of the influx of what is spiritual into what is natural, or of the spiritual world into the natural world, thus of an influx of the Divine wisdom of the Lord. Consider, also, whether you can think analytically about any form of government, any civil law, any moral virtue, or any spiritual truth, unless the Divine out of His wisdom flows in through the spiritual world. As for me, I could not and cannot.

This not only appears unwarrantable, but a substantial error. The author, in making new use of this material, simply brings the time of this remarkable experience down to the then present, which was about 1768, the date of this work. A year later, in using yet again some of the same material and referring to the same experience (in <a href="../tcr/12.htm">True Christian Religion 12</a>) he extends the period another year, and makes it twenty-six years. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #419 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>419. 'Everyone can confirm himself in favor of the Divine from the visible things of nature, if he considers what is known about bees; that they know how to gather wax and suck honey out of herbs and flowers; and to build cells like little houses, and dispose them in the form of a city, with streets through which they go in and by which they pass out; that from a long way off they scent the flowers and the herbs from which they gather wax for their house and honey for their food, and laden with these fly back, according to the quarter of the heavens, directly to their hive, and thus provide for themselves food and habitation for the coming winter just as if they knew and foresaw it. They also appoint over them a mistress like a queen, from whom a posterity is propagated, and build for her as it were a palace above them, with guards round about; and when the time of bringing forth is at hand she goes with her attendants from cell to cell and lays eggs, which the following crowd anoint that they may not be injured by the air.

<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #419 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>419. "Quisque ex visibilibus in Natura pro Divino se potest confirmare, dum attendit ad illa quae nota sunt de Apibus, quod sciant ex herbis et floribus colligere ceram, et exsugere mel, ac struere cellas sicut domunculas, et disponere illas in formam civitatis cum plateis, per quas intrent et per quas exeant; quod e longinquo odorent flores et herbas, e quibus colligant ceras pro domo, et mella pro victu, et quod illis referti revolent secundum plagam ad suum alveare; sic prospiciunt sibi victum et habitationem pro ventura hyeme, sicut illam scirent et praeviderent; praeficiunt etiam sibi dominam sicut reginam, ex qua posteritas propagetur; et pro illa quasi aulam supra struunt, cum satellitiis circum, quae cum tempus partus instat, vadit in comitatu a satellitiis a cellula in cellulam, et ponit ova, quae turba sequens circumlinit ne laedantur ab aere; inde illis nova soboles: postea cum haec ad aetatem suam provecta est, ut similia possint facere, expellitur domo; ac expulsum examen se primum colligit, et inde in turma, ne consociatio dissipetur, dein evolat ad evestigandum sibi domicilium: circa autumnum etiam inutiles fuci educuntur, et deprivantur alis, ne redeant, et escas suas, quibus nihil operae impenderunt, consumant, praeter plura: ex quibus constare potest, quod illis propter usum, quem praestant Humano Generi, ex influxu e spirituali Mundo sit forma regiminis qualis est apud homines in terris, imo apud Angelos in Coelis: quis cui ratio illibata est, non videt, quod talia apud illos non sint ex Naturali Mundo; quid Sol, a quo natura est, commune habet cum regimine aemulo et analogo regiminis coelestis. Ex his et similibus apud Animalia bruta, confessor et cultor naturae confirmat se pro natura, cum confessor et cultor Dei ex iisdem se confirmat pro Divino; nam spiritualis homo videt spiritualia in illis, et naturalis homo videt naturalia in illis, ita quisque qualis est. Quod me attinet, talia mihi fuerunt testimonia influxus spiritualis in naturale, seu Mundi spiritualis in Mundum naturalem, ita a Divina Sapientia Domini. Expende etiam, num de aliqua forma regiminis, aut de aliqua lege civili, aut de aliqua virtute morali, aut de aliqua veritate spirituali, potes analytice cogitare, nisi Divinum ex Sapientia sua per Mundum Spiritualem influat, quod ad me, non potui, nec possum; animadverti enim perceptibiliter et sensibiliter influxum illum nunc per 25 Annos continue; quare hoc dico ex testato. </p>
