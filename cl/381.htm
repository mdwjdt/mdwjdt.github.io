<h4 align="center"></h4><p>381、记事二：<br><br>有一次，我环顾灵人界，发现远处有一座宫殿，四周似乎被一大群人围住了；我还看到许多人正奔向那里。我对此感到惊讶，于是匆忙离开家，向其中一个奔跑者打听那里发生何事。他回答说，有三个尘世来的新人被提上天堂，在那里见识了壮丽辉煌的景象，包括拥有惊人美貌的少女和妻子。现在他们从天上下来了，已经进入这座宫殿，要讲述他们的见闻。他们尤其讲到天上的美，是眼所未见的那种，除非有天堂氛围的光照。他们自我介绍说，他们在世时是法国的演讲者，曾致力于培养雄辨的口才，现在迫不急待地想要发表有关美丽起源的演讲。周边地区的人得知这个消息后蜂涌而至，来听他们演讲。闻听此言，我也急忙赶到那里，进入宫殿。只见那三人站在中央，他们身穿蓝宝石色的长袍，长袍是用金丝线织就的，随着他们转动如同金子那样闪闪发光。他们站在讲台后准备演讲；很快其中一人起身站到讲台后面的台阶上，就女性美丽的起源发表自己的演讲，内容如下。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #381 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>381. The second experience.<p>I once looked around into the spiritual world, and saw at a distance a palace surrounded, one might almost say besieged, by a crowd; and I saw many people hurrying towards it. Being surprised at this, I quickly left home and asked one of those hurrying what was going on there.<p>He replied that three newcomers from the world had been taken up into heaven and seen magnificent sights there, including maidens and wives of amazing beauty; and now that they had been sent down from that heaven, they had gone into the palace, and were reporting what they had seen. In particular they said that the beauties there were such as they had never set eyes on, nor could they see them, except when enlightened by the light of heavenly aura. They said that they themselves had been in the world orators from the kingdom of France. They had made eloquence their business, and were now overcome by a desire to make a speech about the source of beauty. When this became known in the neighbourhood, a large number of people had gathered to listen.<p>On hearing this I too made haste and entered the palace. I saw the three men standing in the middle, wearing robes of sapphire colour with gold thread interwoven, which made them glitter like gold as they turned. They stood behind a platform, ready to speak. Then someone got up on a step behind the platform to make a speech about the source of the beauty of the female sex. What he said was this. </p>

The second account:<p>When I once looked about into the world of spirits, I saw at a distance a palace, surrounded and seemingly besieged by a crowd of people. And I also saw many others running towards it. Wondering at this, I quickly arose from my house and asked one of those running what was happening. He replied that three newcomers from the world had been taken up into heaven and had seen magnificent things there, including maidens and wives of astonishing beauty. Having been let down from that heaven, they had now entered the palace over there and were recounting what they had seen, especially that they had found women of such beauty, the like of which their listeners' eyes had never seen, and which they could not see unless illumined by the light of the heavenly atmosphere. They said in regard to themselves that they had been lecturers in the world, from the kingdom of France, that they had cultivated a facility in the art of speaking, and that they were now overcome with a desire to speak about the origin of beauty. Because this was made known in the surrounding area, the multitude flocked in to hear them.<p>Hearing this, I, too, hastened and went in; and I saw the three men standing in the center, dressed in sapphire-colored gowns, which, being inwoven with threads of gold, shone as though golden at their every turn. They stood behind a kind of pulpit, in readiness to speak; and presently one of them rose up on the step behind the pulpit to give his lecture on the origin of the beauty of the feminine sex, in which he presented the following: </p>

The second story: Once as I was looking around in the world of spirits, I saw at a distance a palace surrounded by a crowd, as if it were besieged. And I saw many others running up, besides.<p>When I saw this, I hurried outside and asked one of the people running up what the matter was there.<p>He answered, "Three newcomers from the world were carried up to heaven and saw magnificent things there - including young women and wives of amazing beauty. And when they came down from the heaven they went into that palace and told about what they saw - mainly that there were such beauties as their eyes had never seen, and couldn't see without being enlightened by the light of heaven's atmosphere. About themselves, they said that in the world they were orators from the kingdom of France and devoted themselves to works of oratory, and now a desire to hold forth about the source of beauty had come over them. The news got around the neighborhood, so a crowd gathered to hear the discussion."<p>When I heard this I hurried too, and went in and saw the three men standing among them, dressed in sapphire - colored robes that shone like gold when they moved, due to inwoven gold threads. They stood behind a sort of pulpit, ready to speak. Soon one orator climbed up onto the step behind the pulpit to speak about the source of the feminine sex's beauty, and he spoke these words: </p>

The second Memorable Relation:<p>When looking around in the world of spirits, I once saw in the distance a palace, surrounded and, as it were, besieged by a great crowd; I also saw many men running towards it. Astonished at this, I hastily left home and asked one of the runners what was going on there. He replied that three new-comers from the world had been taken up into a heaven and had there seen magnificent things and also maidens and wives of wondrous beauty. When let down from that heaven, they had gone into this palace and told what they had seen, especially that they had seen beauties such as their eyes had never seen nor can see unless enlightened by the light of the aura of heaven. As to themselves, they had said that in the world they had been orators from the kingdom of France, and had devoted themselves to the cultivation of eloquence, and that now a desire to deliver an oration on the origin of beauty had come upon them. This had been made known in the neighborhood, and in consequence a great crowd had flocked in to hear them.<p>Hearing this, I also hastened thither, and entering in I saw the three men standing in the center. They were clothed with robes of a sapphire color, and at every turn they made, their robes, from the golden threads inwoven in them, shone as though they were all gold. They stood behind a sort of pulpit, ready to speak. Presently one of them stood up on the step behind the pulpit to deliver his oration on the origin of beauty in the female sex. He then put forth the following: </p>

Once as I was looking about in the world of spirits, I saw in the distance a palace, surrounded and seemingly besieged by a crowd. I also saw many running toward it. Wondering at this, I hurried from the house and asked one of those running what was going on. He replied that three newcomers from the world had been taken up into heaven, where they had seen magnificent things, and maidens and wives of amazing beauty; and having been let down from that heaven they had come to this palace, and were relating what they had seen, especially the beauties, such as their eyes had never seen, nor could see unless illumined with the light of the aura of heaven. They said that they had been orators in the world and came from France, had bestowed care upon eloquence, and now were seized with a desire to speak on the origin of beauty. Word of this in the neighborhood had brought the multitude together to hear.<p>On hearing this, I also hastened to the palace and entered. I saw the three men standing in the midst, clad in togas of a sapphire color, which glistened like gold at every movement from the golden threads woven into them. The men were standing behind a sort of pulpit, ready to speak. Presently one of them mounted the pulpit steps to declaim on the origin of the beauty of the female sex. This was his pronouncement: </p>

The Second Relation: <p>Once when I was looking around in the world of spirits, I saw in the distance a palace, surrounded, and as it were besieged by a multitude; and I also saw many running towards it. Astonished at this I hastily left the house and asked one who was running what was the matter there.

As to themselves, they said that in the world they had been orators from the kingdom of France, and that they had given attention to the cultivation of eloquence, and now there had come upon them a desire to speak on the origin of beauty. This having become known in the vicinity was the cause of the multitude flocking together to hear.<p>Hearing this I also hastened thither and entered. And I saw those three men standing in the midst, clad in togas of the color of sapphire, which as they turned glistened as with gold, from threads of gold interwoven. They were standing behind a sort of rostrum ready to speak. And presently one arose upon a step behind the rostrum, to declaim respecting the origin of the beauty of the female sex, and advanced this: </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #381 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>381. Alterum Memorabile. Quondam cum circumspexi in Mundum spirituum, vidi e longinquo Palatium circumcinctum et quasi obsessum a turba; et quoque vidi accurrentes multos; quod cum miratus, velociter extuli me domo, et unum accurrentem quaesivi, quod rei ibi; ille retulit, quod Tres novi advenae e Mundo sublati fuerunt in Coelum, et viderint magnifica ibi, et quoque Virgines et Uxores stupendae pulchritudinis, ac demissi e Coelo illo intraverint in illud Palatium, ac narraverint quae viderant, imprimis quod tales pulchritudines, quales oculi illorum nusquam viderunt, nec videre possunt nisi a luce aurae coelestis illustrati: dixerunt de se, quod fuerint in Mundo Oratores, ex Regno Galliae, et quod operam dederint facundiae, et quod nunc supervenerit illos cupido orandi de Origine pulchritudinis. Hoc quia in vicinia notum factum est, affluxit multitudo audiendi causa. His auditis, properavi etiam ego, et intravi, et vidi Tres illos viros stantes in medio, indutos togis coloris sapphirini, quae ex filis intextis auri secundum versuram exsplenduerunt sicut aureae; steterunt post quoddam pulpitum prompti ad fandum, et mox super gradum post pulpitum surrexit unus oraturus de Origine pulchritudinis Sexus foeminini, et protulit haec. </p>
