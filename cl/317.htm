<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第317节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第十四章  再婚</h4><p>317、有一个问题可能会引起争论，即婚姻之爱，也就是一个男人和一个妻子的爱，在一方配偶死后，能否分离，或转移，或被覆盖；还有，再婚与一夫多妻是否有共同之处，因而可否被称为连续的一夫多妻。更不用说推理者惯于堆积上重重疑点的其它许多问题。因此，为叫那些在幽暗中推理这些婚姻的调查专家看到一丝曙光，我觉得有必要将以下要点呈给他们的判断力，即：<br><br>⑴一方配偶死后，是否再婚取决于以前的婚姻之爱。<br><br>⑵它还取决于他们生活所在的婚姻状态。<br><br>⑶对那些没有真正婚姻之爱的人来说，再婚没有任何阻挠或障碍。<br><br>⑷凡以前与其配偶以真正婚姻之爱的状态共同生活的人都不愿再婚，除非出于婚姻之爱以外的原因。<br><br>⑸少男与少女的婚姻状态不同于少男与寡妇的。<br><br>⑹鳏夫与少女的婚姻状态也不同于鳏夫与寡妇的。<br><br>⑺就爱情及其属性而言，这些婚姻的种类和多样性数不胜数。<br><br>⑻寡妇的处境比鳏夫的更艰难。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">第二次婚姻</h4><p>317、人们会想到一个男人和一个女人间的婚姻之爱，在一方死去后，与另外一个人的结婚是否是可以的，是否可以传递或与另外一个人的爱相冲突。人们还会想到二次婚姻是否夫多妻或一妻多夫之。还会有很多问题会使人困惑。在此，做以下说明以帮助人们理解这方面的问题。</p><p>（1）配偶死后是否再婚，取决于从前的婚姻之爱。</p><p>（2）还取决于他们从前婚姻的状况。</p><p>（3）那些没有真正婚姻之爱的人，没有什么应该阻止他们再婚。</p><p>（4）与从前的伴侣有真正的婚姻之爱的人不希望再婚，除非是有与婚姻之爱无关的原因。</p><p>（5）处男和处女的婚姻与有经历的男人与寡妇的婚姻状态不同。</p><p>（6）鳏夫与处女婚姻状态与鳏夫与寡妇的婚姻状态不同。</p><p>（7）这种婚姻在其中种类，不同性质特征以及他们之间的爱等方面有不胜例举的种类。</p><p>（8）寡妇的状况会比鳏夫的状况更难。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #317 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>317. CHAPTER XIV. SECOND MARRIAGES<p>The question may be debated whether conjugial love, that of one man with one wife, can after the death of a partner be divided, or copied or overlaid; as well as whether second marriages have anything in common with polygamy and so might be called polygamous by succession. Not to mention many other points which those who rely on reason may pile up like scruples added to scruples. To shed some light therefore for experts in investigation, who reason about these marriages in darkness, I decided it would be worth while presenting them with the following propositions to judge:<p>(i) Contracting a second marriage after the death of a partner depends upon the previous conjugial love.<p>(ii) It also depends upon the state of the marriage in which they had lived.<p>(iii) Those who had lacked truly conjugial love encounter no obstacle or hindrance to contracting another marriage.<p>(iv) Those who had lived mutually in truly conjugial love do not wish to marry again, except for reasons which have nothing to do with conjugial love.<p>(v) The state of a marriage between a young man and a young woman is different from that between a young man and a widow.<p>(vi) The state of a marriage between a widower and a young woman is different from that between a widower and a widow.<p>(vii) The variations and diversities of these marriages as regards love and its attributes are beyond all counting.<p>(viii) The state of a widow is more distressing than that of a widower.<p>There now follows an explanation of these points. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #317 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>317. SECOND MARRIAGES<p>It may possibly come into consideration whether conjugial love, which is a love between one man and one wife, can, after the death of a partner, be severed, or transferred, or overlaid with another. Also, whether second marriages share any common characteristic with polygamy, and thus whether they may be termed a serial form of polygamy. And many other questions besides, which in the minds of reasoners tend regularly to intervene with one moral scruple after another. Therefore, to inform masters of casuistry who reason in darkness about such marriages and to enable them to see some light, I thought it would be useful to present to their judgment the following points on the subject, which are:<p>1. Whether to marry again after the death of a partner depends on the conjugial love had previously.<p>2. It depends also on the status of the marriage in which they had been living.<p>3. In the case of people who did not have truly conjugial love, nothing hinders or prevents them from marrying again.<p>4. People who before had lived with their partners in a state of truly conjugial love do not wish to marry again, except for reasons dissociated from conjugial love.<p>5. The marriage of an inexperienced man with a virgin differs in state from the marriage of an inexperienced man with a widow.<p>6. The marriage of a widower with a virgin likewise differs in state from the marriage of a widower with a widow.<p>7. The various and diverse natures of these marriages in respect to the love in them and its character are altogether beyond number.<p>8. The state of a widow is harder than the state of a widower.<p>Explanation of these statements now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #317 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>317. Chapter 14. Remarriage<p>The questions might be raised, whether married love, which is love of one man and one woman, can be set aside or transferred or added to after the death of a partner, and also whether remarriage has something in common with polygamy and thus whether it can be called progressive polygamy - besides other questions that have a way of adding problems to problems for people who argue the point.<p>So I thought it worthwhile to let the following topics about repeated marriages stand trial, so that the masters of investigation, who reason in the dark about these marriages, can see some light.<p>The topics are:<p>1. Remarriage after the death of a partner depends on the married love that preceded.<p>2. It also depends on the state of the marriage the partners had lived in.<p>3. Nothing stands in the way or is against those who did not have a real married love, if they marry again.<p>4. Those who have lived together in real married love do not want to marry again, unless for reasons not connected with married love.<p>5. The state of marriage of a young man with a virgin is different from the state of marriage of a young man with a widow.<p>6. And the state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is different from that of a widower with a widow.<p>7. The variations and diversities of these marriages, as to love and its characteristics, are beyond number.<p>8. A widow is in a worse situation than a widower.<p>An explanation of these topics follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #317 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>317. REPEATED MARRIAGES<p>The question may come under discussion as to whether, after the death of the partner, conjugial love, which is the love of one man with one wife, can be separated or transferred or superinduced; and also, as to whether repeated marriages have anything in common with polygamy and so may be called successive polygamy; besides many other questions which with reasoners are wont to pile up doubt on doubt. Therefore, in order that masters of casuistry, who reason in the shade about these marriages, may see some light, I have thought it worth while to present to their judgment the following articles concerning them, to wit:<p>I. That after the death of the partner, again to contract matrimony depends on the preceding conjugial love.<p>II. That it depends also on the state of marriage in which they had lived.<p>III. That in the case of those with whom there had been no love truly conjugial, there is nothing to prevent and hinder them from again contracting matrimony.<p>IV. That those who have lived together in love truly conjugial do not wish to marry again, unless for reasons apart from conjugial love.<p>V. That the state of marriage of a young man with a virgin is different from that of a young man with a widow.<p>VI. Also that the state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is different from that of a widower with a widow.<p>VII. That the varieties and diversities of these marriages, with respect to love and its attributes, exceed all number.<p>VIII. That the state of a widow is more grievous than that of a widower.<p>Now follows the explanation of the above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #317 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>317. XIII. REMARRIAGE<p>It may be asked whether the marital love of one man and one wife is separable from a partner who has died, or can be transferred, or added to; also whether remarriage does not come to have something in common with polygamy, thus whether it is not to be called successive polygamy; besides much else which is wont to multiply scruples with reasoners. In order, therefore, that masters of casuistry who reason in the shade about remarriage may see some light, I have thought it worth while to present to the judgment the following propositions on the subject, namely:<p>I. Contracting matrimony again after the partner's death depends on the preceding marital love.<p>II. It also depends on the state of marriage in which the two had lived.<p>III. With those who were in no true marital love, there is no obstacle or hindrance to contracting matrimony again.<p>IV. Those who have lived together in true marital love do not want to marry again, except for reasons aside from marital love.<p>V. The state of marriage of a young man with a virgin is one thing, of a young man with a widow another.<p>VI. The state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is also one thing, and that of a widower with a widow another.<p>VII. The variety and diversity of these marriages as to love and its attributes are beyond number.<p>VIII. The state of a widow is more grievous than that of a widower.<p>Explanation of these propositions follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #317 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>317. CONCERNING REPEATED MARRIAGES.<p>It may come into discussion whether conjugial love, which is of one man with one wife, can after the death of a married partner be separated, or transferred, or superinduced; so also whether repeated marriages have anything in common with polygamy, and may thus be called successive polygamy; besides many other questions which with reasoners are wont to add themselves as scruples to scruples. Therefore, in order that masters of casuistry, who reason in the shade about these marriages, may see some light, I have thought it would be worthwhile to present to the judgment the following propositions concerning them, viz.<p>(1) That whether to contract matrimony again after the death of a married partner depends upon the preceding conjugial love.<p>(2) That it depends also upon the state of marriage in which they had lived.<p>(3) That with those who had not love truly conjugial nothing stands in the way, or hinders their contracting matrimony again.<p>(4) That those who have lived together in love truly conjugial do not wish to marry again, unless for reasons apart from conjugial love.<p>(5) That the state of marriage of a young man with a virgin is of one kind, and that of a young man with a widow of another.<p>(6) Also that the state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is of one kind, and that of a widower with a widow of another.<p>(7) That the varieties and diversities of these marriages, as to love and its attributes, exceed all number.<p>(8) That the state of a widow is more grievous than the state of a widower.<p>Now follows the explanation of these. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #317 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>317. DE CONJUGIIS ITERATIS <p>In ventilationem potest venire, num Amor conjugialis, qui est unius viri cum una uxore, post mortem conjugis possit separari, aut transcribi, aut superinduci; tum etiam num Conjugia iterata aliquid commune obtineant cum Polygamia, et sic num vocari possint Polygamiae successivae; praeter plura, quae scrupulos scrupulis se addere solent apud ratiocinatores; ut itaque scrutiniorum magistri, qui in umbra de his conjugiis ratiocinantur, videant aliquam lucem, operis pretium censui fore, sequentes Articulos de illis ad judicium sistere, qui sunt: <sup>1</sup>I. Quod post mortem conjugis iterum contrahere matrimonium, dependeat a praecedente amore conjugiali.<p>II. Quod etiam a statu conjugii, in quo vixerant.<p>III. Quod illis, quibus non fuit amor vere conjugialis, nihil obstet et obsit, quin matrimonium iterato contrahant.<p>IV. Quod illi, qui inter se in amore vere conjugiali vixerant, iteratum conjugium non velint; nisi propter causas separatas ab amore conjugiali.<p>V. Quod alius sit status conjugii juvenis cum virgine, et alius juvenis cum vidua.<p>VI. Quod etiam alius status conjugii sit vidui cum virgine, et alius vidui cum vidua.<p>VII. Quod varietates et diversitates horum conjugiorum quoad amorem et ejus attributa, excedant omnem numerum.<p>VIII. Quod status viduae gravior sit statu vidui.
