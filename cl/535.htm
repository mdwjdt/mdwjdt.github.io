<h4 align="center"></h4><p>535、这事过后，我听见地下传来怀有敌意的低语，伴随着这些话：“行一些神迹，我们就会相信。”“难道这些不是神迹？”我反问。<br><br>“不是。”<br><br>“那什么是神迹？”<br><br>“展现并揭示未来，我们必信你。”<br><br>“从天上得到这类启示是不可能的，因为人越知道未来，他的理性和理解力，连同他的谨慎和智慧就越荒废，变得不活跃并衰退。”<br><br>我又问：“我还要行出什么样的神迹？”<br><br>“就像摩西在埃及所行的。”<br><br>“恐怕你们会像法老和埃及人那样心硬。”<br><br>“不会。”<br><br>“你们向我保证，你们不会围着金牛犊（‘金牛犊’在灵义上是指肉体的乐趣）跳舞，并向它下拜，像雅各的后代那样，因为他们在看见整个西乃山燃烧起来，听见耶和华亲自从火中说话，也就是说，在看见最大的神迹之后一个月的时间内，就做出这种事来。”<br><br>“我们必不像雅各的后代。”<br><br>不过，这时，我听见从天上向他们传来的消息：“你们若不相信摩西和众先知，也就是主的圣言，就不会凭神迹相信，和雅各的子孙在旷野中所行的一样。你们也必与那些亲眼看见主本人在世时所行神迹的人一样不相信。”（全书完）</p><h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>535、之后我听到下面的人群有恶意的话语。他们喊道：“创造奇迹吧，那样我们就会相信！”</p><p>我问他们这些启示录不是一种奇迹吗，他们说：“不是。”</p><p>于是我问他们要什么样的奇迹，他们说：“告诉我们将要发生的事情，我们就会相信。”</p><p>我答道：“这样的知识天国不允许。因为人若知道了将来要发生的事，人的理性和理解力就会处于被动状态，会变得不积极并丧失掉。”</p><p>我又问：“我还要做什么样的奇迹呢？”</p><p>我听到他们喊：“做象摩西在埃及时那样的奇迹！”</p><p>我说：“你们也许会象法老和埃及人一样变得狠心。”</p><p>他们说不会。</p><p>我又说：“向我保证你们不会象约旧的后代那样围着金牛跳舞并敬拜它。他们在看到西奈山着火并听到耶和华从火中传来的声音后不那么做了。金牛的精神含义是指躯体的快乐。”</p><p>人们回答道：“我们不会象约伯的后代那样。”</p><p>但这时我听到天国中一个声音对他们说：“若你们不相信摩西和使徒们，也就是说主的话，你们也就不会比约伯的后代有更多的见解。也不会比他们更多地相信主在世间时创造的奇迹。”</p><br><p align="center"><a href="534.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a>　 <a href="536.htm">下一节</a></p><hr />
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #535 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>535. After this I heard a threatening murmur coming from the underworld, accompanied by these words, 'Perform some miracles, and we shall believe.' 'Are these not miracles?' I asked in reply. 'No,' they answered. 'What miracles then?' I asked. 'Make plain and reveal the future,' they said, 'and we shall have faith in you.' But I answered them, 'Such revelations from heaven are impossible, because in so far as a person knows the future, so far does his reason and intellect, together with his prudence and wisdom, fall into disuse, become inactive and collapse.'<p>I asked again, 'What miracles am I to perform?' Then a shout went up, 'Do ones like Moses did in Egypt.' 'Perhaps,' I replied, 'you might harden your hearts at them, like Pharaoh and the Egyptians.' They replied that they would not. But I said again, 'Promise me that you will not dance around the golden calf and worship it like the descendants of Jacob, as they did within the space of a month after seeing the whole of Mount Sinai ablaze, and hearing Jehovah Himself speaking out of the fire; that is to say, after the greatest of miracles. (The golden calf in the spiritual sense is the pleasures of the flesh.) A reply came from below, 'We shall not be like the descendants of Jacob.'<p>But then I heard this message given to them from heaven. 'If you do not believe Moses and the Prophets, that is, the Word of the Lord, you will no more be made to believe by miracles than were Jacob's sons in the desert. Nor will you believe any more than those did who saw with their own eyes the miracles performed by the Lord Himself, when He was in the world.' </p><h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #535 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>535. After that I heard a hostile murmur from people below, and at the same time this cry, "Do miracles and we will believe!"<p>In response I asked whether these revelations were not miracles, and received the reply, "They are not."<p>So I asked what miracles they meant, then, and was told, "Show us and reveal to us things to come and we will believe."<p>But I replied, "Such knowledge is not granted from heaven, since to the degree that a person knows things to come, his reason and understanding fall with his prudence and wisdom into a state of passivity, become inactive, and are overthrown."<p>Again therefore I asked, "What other miracles shall I do?"<p>Whereupon I then heard the cry, "Do miracles like the ones Moses did in Egypt!"<p>To that I replied, "Perhaps you will harden your hearts to them as Pharaoh and the Egyptians did."<p>And they answered that they would not.<p>Again I said, however, "Swear to me that you will not dance around a golden calf and worship it like the posterity of Jacob, <sup >1</sup>which they did within the space of a month after they saw the whole of Mount Sinai ablaze and heard Jehovah Himself speaking from out of the fire, <sup >2</sup>thus which they did following a miracle which was the greatest of all. A golden calf in the spiritual sense is the pleasure of the flesh."<p>And the people replied from below, "We will not be like the posterity of Jacob."<p>But at that I then heard this declaration to them from heaven, "If you do not believe Moses and the prophets, which is to say, the Word of the Lord, you will not believe as a result of miracles any more than the children of Jacob did in the wilderness; neither any more than those others believed when they saw with their own eyes the miracles the Lord Himself performed when He was in the world." <sup >3</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_32_1.htm">Exodus 32</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16-20</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>.<p>INDEX OF NARRATIVE ACCOUNTS<p>Conjugial love seen in its embodiment in a married couple conveyed down from heaven (nos. <a href="42.htm">42</a>, <a href="43.htm">43</a>).<p>Three newcomers from the world instructed about marriages in heaven (no. <a href="44.htm">44</a>).<p>Concerning a chaste love for the opposite sex (no. <a href="55.htm">55</a>).<p>The Temple of Wisdom, where wise men discussed the reasons for the beauty in the female sex (no. <a href="56.htm">56</a>).<p>Conjugial love among people who lived in the golden age (no. <a href="75.htm">75</a>).<p>Among people who lived in the silver age (no. <a href="76.htm">76</a>).<p>Among people who lived in the copper age (no. <a href="77.htm">77</a>).<p>Among people who lived in the iron age (no. <a href="78.htm">78</a>).<p>Among peoples who lived after those ages (nos. <a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="80.htm">80</a>).<p>A glorification of the Lord by angels in the heavens on account of His advent, and celebrating then conjugial love (no. <a href="81.htm">81</a>).<p>The precepts of the New Church (no. <a href="82.htm">82</a>).<p>The origin of conjugial love and its vigor or potency, discussed by wise men assembled from the European world (nos. <a href="103.htm">103-114</a>).<p>A piece of paper sent down from heaven to the earth, on which was written, "The marriage between good and truth" (no. <a href="115.htm">115</a>).<p>What the image and likeness of God are, and what the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are (nos. <a href="132.htm">132-136</a>).<p>Two angels from the third heaven on conjugial love there (no. <a href="137.htm">137</a>).<p>Some men of olden times in Greece, who inquired of newcomers what news they had from earth and learned of people found in a forest there (nos. 151 [repeated]-154 [repeated]).<p>Golden rain, and a hall where some wives made various comments on the subject of conjugial love (no. <a href="155.htm">155</a> [repeated]).<p>Some sages of olden times in Greece on people's life after death (no. <a href="182.htm">182</a>).<p>A wedding garden called Adramandoni, where a conversation took place on the influx of conjugial love (no. <a href="183.htm">183</a>).<p>Some sages of olden times in Greece on occupations in heaven (no. <a href="207.htm">207</a>).<p>The golden rain and hall, where some wives spoke again on the subject of conjugial love (no. <a href="208.htm">208</a>).<p>The judges swayed by partiality, who were the subject of the cry, "Oh, how just!"

After this I heard a hostile murmur from those below and with it these words, "Do miracles and we'll believe."<p>I asked, "Aren't these things miracles?"<p>The answer was, "They are not."<p>"So what are miracles?" I asked.<p>"Disclose and reveal the future and we'll have faith."<p>But I answered, "Heaven does not grant things like that, because to the extent that a person knows the future his reason and intellect, together with his prudence and wisdom, fall idle, go numb, and collapse."

Post haec audivi infestum murmur ex inferis, et simul has voces, "fac Miracula et credemus;" et quaesivi numne illa sunt miracula, et responsum est, "non sunt;" et quaesivi, quae ergo miracula, et dictum est, "manifesta et revela futura, et fidem habebimus;" sed respondi, "talia e Coelo non dantur, quoniam quantum homo scit futura, tantum ejus ratio et intellectus cum prudentia et sapientia, cadit in otium, torpet, et labefactatur:" et iterum quaesivi, "quae alia Miracula faciam;" et tunc clamatum est, "fac similia quae Moses in Aegypto;" ad hoc respondi, "forte ad illa obduraturi estis corda vestra sicut Pharao et Aegyptii;" et responsum est, quod non; at iterum dixi, "asseverate mihi, quod non saltaturi sitis circum Vitulum aureum, et adoraturi illum sicut posteri Jacobi, quod fecerunt a Mensis spatio postquam viderunt totum Montem Sinai ardentem, et audiverunt Ipsum Jehovam ex igne loquentem, ita post miraculum, quod erat omnium maximum; Vitulus aureus in Spirituali sensu est Voluptas carnis;" et responsum est ex inferis, "non erimus sicut posteri Jacobi." At tunc audivi hoc e Coelo illis dictum, "si non creditis Mosen et Prophetas, hoc est, Verbum Domini, non credetis ex Miraculis plus quam filii Jacobi in deserto; neve plus quam illi crediderunt, dum suis oculis viderunt Miracula ab Ipso Domino, dum fuit in Mundo, facta." </p><br><p align="center"><a href="534.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></p></div>
