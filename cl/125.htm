<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第125节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>125、⑹丈夫不代表主，妻子不代表教会，因为丈夫和妻子二者一起才能形成教会。教会中有一个普遍说法，主是教会的头，所以丈夫是妻子的头。由此会得出这样的结论:丈夫代表主，妻子代表教会。主的确是教会的头，但包括男性和女性在内的人，尤其合在一起的丈夫和妻子，才是教会。在这种情况下，教会首先被植入男人，并通过男人被植入妻子；因为男人以其理解力接受真理，妻子则从这个男人接受它。不过，情况若反过来发生，就不符合正当次序。然而，这种情况有时也会发生，但仅发生在那些不热爱智慧，因而不属教会的男人，或那些像奴仆一样唯妻子马首是瞻的男人当中。对此，请参看前言（21节）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>125、（6）丈夫不代表主，妻子不代表教会，因为丈夫和妻子一起构成教会，教会中有人说主是教会之首，所以丈夫是妻子之首。若是这样，随之而来的推理就是丈夫代表主，妻子代表教会。但实际上是，主是教会之首，人——男人和女人构成教会，或更进一步地说，丈夫和妻子构成教会。</p><p>在夫妻之间，教会会首先体现在男人身上，男人获得教会所传授的道理（真理），妻子通过丈夫而获得这些道理，反之则不符合规律。但这种情况有时也存在。这种情况下的男人或者是不渴望变得智慧，或者是依附于妻子的人。</p><p>关于这个参见21节</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #125 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>125. (vi) The husband does not represent the Lord and his wife the church, because they both together, husband and wife, make up the church.<p>It is generally said in the church that as the Lord is the head of the church, so the husband is the head of the wife. <sup >1</sup>From this it would follow that the husband would represent the Lord and the wife the church. But the Lord is the head of the church, and human beings, male and female, are the church; and even more so in the case of husband and wife. In this case the church is first planted in the man and by means of the man in the wife, because the man receives its truth in his intellect, and the wife receives it from the man. But if it happens the other way round, this is not in good order. However, this does sometimes happen, but only in the case of men who are no lovers of wisdom, and so not part of the church either, or who in servile fashion hang upon their wives' whims. On this subject generally see the remark in the Preliminaries (<a href="21.htm">21</a>).<p><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ephesians_5_23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #125 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>125. 6. A husband does not represent the Lord and his wife the church, because husbands and their wives both together form the church. It is a common saying in the church that as the Lord is the head of the church, so the husband is the head of the wife. <sup >1</sup>If this were true, it would follow that the husband represents the Lord and the wife the church. But the truth is that, whereas the Lord is the head of the church, people - both men and women - are the church, and still more so husbands and wives together.<p>In the case of married couples, the church is implanted first in the man, and through the man in his wife, because the man with his understanding acquires the truth that the church teaches, and the wife acquires it from the man. But if the reverse takes place, it is not according to order. Nevertheless, this sometimes happens, but only in the case of men who either are not lovers of wisdom and so are not part of the church, or who hang like slaves on the bidding of their wives.<p>For something more on this subject, see the introductory chapter, no. <a href="21.htm">21</a>.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Quoting <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ephesians_5_23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>.

<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #125 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>125. 6. A husband does not represent the Lord and a wife the church, because a husband and wife both together make a church. It is a commonplace in the church that just as the Lord is head of the church a husband is head of his wife. This implies that the husband represents the Lord and the wife the church. But the Lord is head of the church, and people - male and female - are the church. A husband and wife together are even more so. The church is first implanted for them in the man, and through the man, in the wife, because the man accepts its truth in his mind, and the wife gets it from the man. If it works the other way it is in the wrong order.<p>And this does in fact happen - but this is either among men who do not love wisdom, and so they are not of the church, or among those who hang on the beck and call of their wives, like slaves.<p>(Something about this matter appears in Chapter 1, no. 21.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #125 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>125. VI. THAT THE HUSBAND DOES NOT REPRESENT THE LORD, AND THE WIFE THE CHURCH, BECAUSE BOTH TOGETHER, THE HUSBAND AND HIS WIFE, MAKE THE CHURCH. It is a common saying in the Church that, as the Lord is the head of the Church, so the husband is the head of the wife; from which it would follow that the husband represents the Lord and the wife the Church. But the Lord is the head of the Church, and man, man and woman, and still more husband and wife together, are the Church. With these, the Church is first implanted in the man and through the man in his wife; for the man receives its truth in his understanding, and the wife receives it from the man. If the reverse is the case, it is not according to order. Sometimes, however, it is the case, but with men who are not lovers of wisdom and therefore are not of the Church; also with those who depend as slaves on the bidding of their wives. But of this matter, something may be seen in the Preliminaries, no. <a href="21.htm">21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #125 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>125. (vi) The husband does not represent the Lord and the wife the Church, inasmuch as both together, husband and wife, constitute the Church. It is commonly said in the Church that as the Lord is the head of the Church, so the husband is the head of the wife, which would imply that the husband represents the Lord, and the wife the Church. But while the Lord is the head of the Church, man and woman together, and still more husband and wife together, make the Church. In the case of husband and wife, the Church is implanted first in the man and through him in the wife, because he receives its truth in the understanding, while the wife does so from him. When it is the other way about, order is violated. Still this does sometimes happen, but with men who either are not lovers of wisdom and so not men of the Church, or are slavishly at the beck of their wives. On this subject something may be seen under "Preliminary" (<a href="21.htm">21</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #125 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>125. (6) That the husband does not represent the Lord and the wife the Church; because both together, the husband and wife make the Church. It is a common saying in the church that, as the Lord is the head of the church, so is the husband the head of the wife; from which it would follow that the husband represents the Lord, and the wife the church. But the Lord is the head of the church, and man (Latin: homo) - man and woman - are the church; and still more husband and wife together. The church with them is first implanted in the man, and through the man in the wife; because the man receives its truth in his understanding, and the wife from the man. If the contrary, it is not according to order. This however does sometimes occur; but with men who either are not lovers of wisdom, and therefore, are not of the church; as also with those who depend as slaves on the beck of their wives. But of this matter something may be seen in the Preliminaries, n. <a href="21.htm">21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #125 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>125. VI. Quod Maritus non repraesentet Dominum, et Uxor Ecclesiam, quia ambo simul, Maritus et ejus Uxor, faciunt Ecclesiam. Communis sermo est intra Ecclesiam, quod sicut Dominus est Caput Ecclesiae, ita Maritus est Uxoris; ex quo sequeretur, quod Maritus repraesentet Dominum, et Uxor Ecclesiam; sed Dominus est Caput Ecclesiae, et Homo, vir et foemina, sunt Ecclesia, et plus adhuc Maritus et Uxor simul; apud hos Ecclesia primum implantatur viro, et per virum uxori, quia vir intellectu recipit verum ejus, et uxor a viro; sed si vicissim, non est secundum ordinem: quandoque tamen hoc fit, sed apud viros, qui vel non amantes sapientiae, et inde nec Ecclesiae sunt, ut et apud illos qui ut mancipia pendent a nutibus suarum uxorum. De hac re videatur aliquid in Praeliminaribus, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_125/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_21" target=_top>21</a>. </p>
