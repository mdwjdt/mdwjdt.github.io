<h4 align="center"></h4><p>505、⑷死后，那些确认奸污处女的淫欲不是罪恶之人的命运是可怕的。他们命运是这样：他们在灵人界度过第一段时期，就是因与天使灵相伴而谦逊和道德的一段时期后，便从外在状态被带入内在状态，从而被带入在世时网罗他们的淫欲。他们被带入自己的淫欲，是为了叫他们看清这些淫欲所在的级别；若它们级别较低，那么被带入其中后，他们有可能从中解脱出来，并充满羞耻感。<br><br>但那些深陷这种恶毒的淫欲，到了感觉它的快乐就是至高无上的乐趣，并炫耀他们的偷窃行为，如同炫耀丰厚战利品的程度之人，则不肯退出。因此，他们可以自由选择，然后立刻四处寻找妓院；当这些妓院被指给他们时，他们便走了进去；这些妓院在地狱的边缘。不过，当他们发现这里只有妓女时，就离开并打听哪里有处女。于是，他们被带到一些妓女面前，这些妓女能通过幻象表现出非凡的美貌和娇羞少女的迷人魅力，并夸耀自己的贞操；面对她们，这些人怀有和在世时一样的灼热。因此，他们与其讨价还价，达成交易；但当即将享受他们的交易时，由天堂所引发的幻象被驱散了，然后，只见这些所谓的处女面目黢黑、奇形怪状、丑陋无比。然而，这些男人被迫与她们呆上一会儿。这些妓女被称为塞壬。<br><br>如果这类戏法无法成功地使他们从这类疯狂的淫欲中退出，那么他们就被扔进西南边界的一个地狱，就在更狡猾的妓女地狱之下。他们在此加入他们的同伴。我蒙允许看到在地狱中的他们，并被告知，这里有许多人出身贵族和相当富裕的家庭。但他们因在世时就具有这种秉性，故丧失了对自己的出身和源于财富的尊严的一切记忆，并被注入这样一种信念：他们是卑贱的奴隶，因而不值得任何尊重。<br><br>他们在自己人当中看似人模人样，但在那些被允许了解这个地狱的其他人看来，他们就像猿猴，有一张凶残而非温和的脸，并且表情狰狞，而非和颜悦色。他们走路时缩腰弯背，上半身前倾，好像快要跌倒似的；而且臭不可闻。他们憎恶异性，远离他们所看到的任何人，因为他们没有性欲。这是近看时他们的样子，但从远处看，他们就像宠物狗或叭儿狗，而且在他们的语调中能听到类似狗吠的声音。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>505、（4）那些认为诱奸是无罪的人在死后会有悲惨的命运。</p><p>在精神世界中渡过了第一个阶段后，他们被从外在中驱赶到内在中去，即进入到他们在世间时的情欲中去。这样以便能看清他们的情况有多么严重；若程度轻，他们可能会得到帮助而对过去感到耻辱。</p><p>然而那些深陷于其中的人并对其行为进行鼓吹的人则不能被拯救。</p><p>所以他们被允许去做他们喜欢做的事，于是他们就会去寻找妓院（妓院存在于地狱中）。他们会到处问是否有处女。</p><p>那时候他们不会被带到看上去象是美丽的少女的妓女中去。他们会重新体会到他们在世间时所过的生活，并与这些女人达成一致。但之后，真象就会暴露，那些女子变得极丑无比，然而男人们还被迫也她们在一起。这些妓女被称为妖妇。</p><p>之后，若这些男人还不知悔改，他们就会被投入到南边和西边交界处的妓女的地狱之下。那儿的妓女们更狡诈。</p><p>我曾获许到地狱中看到那样的人。还得知许多那样的人都是出身于贵族或富有阶层。但因为他们在世间时的性质，他们没有一点地位和财富而是象低级的奴隶一样。</p><p>他们彼此之间显现为人形，但对于那些获许能看到他们的人他们看上去象猿人，有着野蛮的面孔和可怕的表情。他们也抬不起腰来，他们放着臭气。他们污蔑异性，并对她们没有一丝欲望。</p><p>远处看他们好象是群狗，他们的言语象是犬吠。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #505 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>505. (iv) The fate after death of those who have convinced themselves that the lust for deflowering is not a sinful evil is dire.<p>Their fate is that, after spending an initial period in the world of spirits, a time of modesty and morality, since they are in the company of angelic spirits, they are later brought from their outward into their inward state, and so into the desires which ensnared them in the world, in this case their particular desires, so that the degree in which they were is made clear; if it is a lesser degree, so that after being brought into that state, they may be released from it and be ashamed of themselves.</p><p>[2] But those who were possessed by this wicked lust, to such an extent that they felt its delight as the supreme pleasure, and boasted about these thefts as if they were the spoils of victory - these do not allow themselves to be withdrawn. They are therefore left free to choose, and then at once they wander about asking for brothels; and when these are pointed out to them they go into them. These brothels are at the edges of hell. But when they find there only prostitutes, they leave and ask where the virgins are. Then they are taken to whores who by imagination can equip themselves with surpassing beauty and the flower of girlish grace, and boast of their virginity; these excite their ardour in the same way as in the world. They therefore come to terms with them, and when they are about to achieve what they had agreed, the imaginary appearance sent from heaven is taken away, and these virgins are then to be seen in all their ugliness, monstrous and swarthy; but these men are obliged to cling to them for a while. These whores are called sirens.</p><p>[3] But if such conjuring tricks do not succeed in making them withdraw from this mad lust, they are cast down into a hell which is on the borders of the south and the west, below the hell of the more artful prostitutes. There they join their companions. I was allowed to see them in that hell, and I was told that there are many there of noble and of rather wealthy families. But because of the nature they had in the world, they lose all memory of their birth and rank derived from wealth, and are induced to believe that they were lowly servants so as not to deserve any honour.</p><p>[4] Among themselves they may look like human beings, but to others who are allowed to see into their hell like monkeys, with a scowling instead of a smiling face, and a horrid look instead of a jesting one. They walk with their loins contracted, so that their backs are bent and the upper part of their body leans forward, as if they were on the point of falling over; and they smell bad. They loathe the other sex, and turn away from any of them they see, since they have no desire. This is what they look like close to, but at a distance like lap-dogs or pet puppies. Also there is a sound reminiscent of barking to be heard in their tone of voice. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #505 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>505. 4. Those who persuade themselves that the lust to deflower is not a sinful evil, after death suffer a grievous fate. Their fate is as follows. After they have passed through the first period of time in the world of spirits - which is one of modesty and morality because it is spent in the company of angelic spirits - they are then propelled from their outward qualities into their inward ones, and so into the lusts which had consumed them in the world.<p>They are thus propelled into their lusts in order that it may be seen to what degree they had been caught up in them; and this to the end that, if it was to a minor degree, after having been propelled into them they may be delivered from them and filled with shame.</p><p>[2] However, those who had been caught up in this malevolent lust to the point that they felt its delight as exquisite, and who boasted about their thefts as over rich spoils, do not allow themselves to be withdrawn from them.<p>Therefore they are let go to do as they please, and they immediately wander about then, looking for brothels, which they also enter when these are pointed out to them (the brothels being situated on the peripheries of hell). But when they encounter only prostitutes there, they leave and ask where they may find virgins.<p>At that point they are then taken to harlots who are able by mirage to assume exceptional beauty and a rosy girlish charm and to pass themselves off as virgins, for whom they conceive a passionate ardor like that which they had felt in the world. They come to an arrangement with these women, therefore; but when they are about to consummate the arrangement, the mirage assumed from heaven is removed and the alleged virgins are seen in their ugliness, monstrous and dark. Yet they are compelled to remain with them for a while. Harlots of this sort are called sirens.</p><p>[3] After that, if these men do not allow themselves to be withdrawn from that insane lust of theirs by such beguilements, they are cast down into a hell which is located on the border between the south and west beneath the hell of harlots more cunning still, and there they are associated with their like.<p>I have also been granted to see them in that hell, and I was told that many of them there come from noble stock and the wealthier classes. Yet because they had been of the character they were in the world, all memory of their lineage and the standing they had because of their wealth is taken away, and they have instilled in them the persuasion that they were lowly bond servants and so unworthy of any respect.</p><p>[4] To each other, indeed, they appear as human, but to others who are permitted to look into that hell they appear as apes, having a cruel face instead of a gentle one, and a menacing expression instead of a good-humored one. They go about bowed at the waist and thus bent over, with the upper part of their body hanging forward as though they are about to fall. And they smell. They loathe the opposite sex, and turn away from any they see, for they have no desire.<p>That is how they appear at close range, but at a distance they look like pet dogs or little dogs kept for amusement, and something like the sound of barking is also heard in the intonations of their speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #505 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>505. 4. After death the fate of those who in their own minds establish that lust for defloration is not a sinful evil is serious. Here is what happens to them. When they have gone through the first period in the world of spirits - it is a period of modesty and morality, because it is spent in company with angelic spirits - they are brought from their external life into their inner life and then they have the same lusts that enticed them in the world, to see what level the lusts were on, so that if the lusts were on a lesser level the people can be taken away from them after being introduced to them, and be full of shame. But the ones who enjoyed this wicked passion to the extent that they found outstanding joy in it and took pride in these thefts as in rich spoils, will not let themselves be led away from it. So they are released in freedom, and right away they go around looking for brothels, and when these are pointed out to them, in they go. The brothels are at the sides of hell. But when they find only prostitutes there, they go away and ask where there are virgins. And then they are led to prostitutes who by illusion can represent themselves as outstandingly beautiful, with the blushing charm of girls, and pass themselves off as virgins. The men burn for them the same as in the world. So they bargain with these women. But when they are about to go through with the bargain, heaven takes away the illusion, and then those "virgins" appear in all their ugliness - deformed and dark. Still, the men are compelled to stay with them for a short time. These prostitutes are called sirens.<p>But if the men do not allow themselves to be led away from that insane passion by enchantments like these, they are driven down into a hell on the border between south and west, under the hell of the more cunning prostitutes and are gathered together with their kind. I was even able to see the spirits in that hell, and I was told that there are many there of noble lineage and from wealthy families. But since they were what they were in the world, all memory of lineage and self - respect due to wealth is taken away from them, and they are convinced that they were vile slaves and for that reason not worthy of any respect. Among themselves they do look like humans, but to others who are allowed to look in there they look like apes, with a savage face instead of a seductive one and a frightful expression instead of a suave face. They walk with their groins tucked in, which bends them with their upper part leaning forward as if they are about to fall. And they stink. They loathe the other sex and turn away from females that they see, because they have no desire. This is how they look close up, but from a distance they look like lap dogs, or favorite puppies.<p>And there is also something like barking heard in their voices. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #505 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>505. IV. THAT AFTER DEATH THE LOT OF THOSE WHO HAVE CONFIRMED THEMSELVES IN THE LUST OF DEFLORATION AS NOT BEING AN EVIL OF SIN, IS GRIEVOUS. Their lot is this: After they have passed through the first period in the world of spirits, which is a period of modesty and morality because passed in company with angelic spirits, then, from their externals they are let into their internals and thus into the concupiscences by which they had been consumed in the world. They are let into their concupiscences that it may be seen in what degree these were, and if they were in a minor degree, that after being let into them they may be let out and be covered with shame.</p><p>[2] But those who had been in this malignant lust to such an extent that they felt its delight as eminent, and gloried over their thefts as over rich spoils, do not suffer themselves to be led away from it. They are therefore left in their freedom. Immediately thereafter they wander about and inquire after brothels, and when these are pointed out, they enter them; these brothels are at the sides of hell. But when they meet none there but prostitutes, they go away and inquire where there are virgins. They are then taken to harlots who by fantasy are able to assume surpassing beauty and a blushing girlish charm and to pass themselves off as virgins. For these they have the same burning ardor as in the world. They therefore bargain with them; but when about to enjoy their bargain, the fantasy which had been induced from heaven is dispelled, and those virgins then appear in their own deformity, monstrous and dusky. Nevertheless, they are compelled to stick to them for a short time. These harlots are called sirens.</p><p>[3] If they do not suffer themselves to be led away from their insane lust by such bewitchments, they are cast down into a hell which is on the border of the south and west, beneath the hell of the more cunning harlots, and are there associated with their fellows. It was also granted me to see them in that hell, and I. Was told that many there were of noble stock and among the more opulent; but because they had been of such a character in the world, all memory of their lineage and of the dignity they had from their wealth is taken away, and the persuasion is induced that they had been vile slaves and therefore unworthy of any honor.</p><p>[4] Among themselves they do indeed appear as men, but as seen by others who are allowed to look in there, they appear like apes, with a fierce face instead of a mild, and a horrible countenance instead of a pleasing. Their loins are contracted, and hence they walk bent downwards, their upper part leaning forwards as if about to fall. They are also ill-smelling. They loathe the sex and turn away from those of them whom they see, for they have no desire. Such do they appear when near by, but at a distance they seem like dogs of indulgence or whelps of delights, and something like barking is heard in the sound of their speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #505 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>505. (iv) The lot after death of those who are confirmed in the view that the lust of defloration is not an evil of sin, is grievous. This is their lot. After they have spent a first period in the world of spirits - a period of modesty and morality, inasmuch as they are in the company of angelic spirits - they are let from their externals into their internals and therewith into the lusts by which they had been consumed in the world. They are let into their lusts in order to make it apparent to what degree they had been in them - if it was in a minor degree, after having been let into them, they may thus be brought out of them and made to feel shame.</p><p>[2] But those who had been in this malignant lust to the point that they deeply felt its delight to be surpassing, and boasted about their thefts as over rich spoils, do not suffer themselves to be withdrawn from it. They are therefore let into what is freedom to them, and immediately wander about and seek for brothels, which they enter on having them pointed out. These brothels are at the sides of hell. Encountering only prostitutes there, however, they leave and ask where there are virgins. They are then taken to harlots who through phantasy can induce extreme beauty and girlhood's bloom and grace on themselves, and can feign themselves virgins. To these they warm as they did in the world. They make a pact with them, therefore, but when they are about to avail themselves of the pact, the induced phantasy is dispelled from heaven, whereupon those virgins appear in their deformity, monstrous and black, but the men are forced to cleave to them for a while. These harlots are called sirens.</p><p>[3] If the men do not suffer themselves to be led from that insane lust by such disillusionments, they are cast down into a hell in the southwest beneath the hell of the more cunning harlots, where they are associated with their kind. I was permitted to see the occupants of that hell and was told that many in it are of noble stock and from among the wealthier, but as they had been such in the world, all recollection of lineage and of position due to wealth is taken from them, and the persuasion induced that they had been mean slaves and hence unworthy of any respect. They appear like human beings among themselves, but to others, permitted to glance into that hell, they look like apes, but of a grim instead of genial look and with horrid rather than humorous features. They move drawn in at the loins, and thus bent, the upper body hanging forward as though about to fall; and they have an evil odor. They loathe the sex, and having no desire, turn away from those they see. So they look close by, but at a distance like dogs of indulgence or whelps of voluptuousness; something like barking is also to be heard in the sound of their speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #505 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>505. (4) That the lot after death of those who have confirmed with themselves that the lust of defloration is not an evil of sin is grievous. Their lot is this: That when they have passed through the first period in the world of spirits, which is of modesty and morality, because in association with angelic spirits, after they from their externals are let into their internals, and at the same time into the concupiscences by which they had been allured in the world; and they are let into these in order that it may appear in what degree they were, and if in a minor degree, that after they have been let into them they may be released and be suffused with shame. But those who had been in this malignant lust to such a degree that they perceived eminent delight in it, and gloried in these thefts as over the most honorable spoils, do not suffer themselves to be led away from it. They are therefore, allowed to go forth in their freedom, and then immediately they wander about and inquire for brothels, and when they are pointed out to them they also go in. These places are at the sides of hell. But when they there meet only with prostitutes they go away and inquire where there are virgins. And then they are taken to harlots who by phantasy are able to assume surpassing beauty, and blooming girlish grace, and to boast that they are virgins, towards whom they burn in like manner as in the world. And therefore, they bargain with them; but when about to enjoy their bargain the phantasy induced is dispelled from heaven, and those virgins then appear in their own deformity, monstrous and swarthy, to whom nevertheless they are compelled to cleave for a brief hour. These harlots are called sirens. But if they do not suffer themselves to be led out of their insane lust by such fascinations, they are cast down into a hell which is on the border of the south and west, beneath the hell of the more cunning courtesans, and are associated there with their companions. It was given me to see them in that hell, and I was told that there were many there of noble stock and of the more opulent. But, because they had been of such character in the world, all memory of those things-of their lineage, and of their dignity by virtue of wealth-is taken away, and the persuasion is induced that they are vile slaves and hence unworthy of any honor. Among themselves indeed they appear as men, but as seen by others who are permitted to look in there, they appear like apes, with a savage instead of a kindly face, and horrid features instead of those of pleasantry. They walk drawn together at the loins and thus crooked, the upper part inclined forwards as if about to fall. And they have an offensive smell. They loathe the sex, and turn away from those of them whom they see, for they have no desire. Such do they appear when near, but at a distance like lapdogs or whelps of delights; and something like barking is heard in the sound of their speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #505 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>505. IV. Quod sors illorum, qui apud se confirmaverunt libidinem deflorationis non esse malum peccati, post mortem gravis sit. Sors illorum est haec, quod postquam in Mundo spirituum exegerunt tempus primum, quod est modestiae et moralitatis, quia in consortiis cum spiritibus angelicis, <sup>1</sup>postea ab externis suis immittantur in interna sua, et tunc in concupiscentias, quibus inescati fuerant in Mundo, et hi in suas, propter finem, ut appareat in quo gradu fuerant; et si in minori gradu, ut postquam in illas immissi fuerint, emittantur, et suffundantur pudore.</p><p>[2] At illi qui in maligna hac libidine fuerant, in tantum ut persenserint ejus delitium eminens, et gloriati sunt super furtis illis sicut super spoliis opimis, non patiuntur se abduci, quare emittuntur in suum liberum, et tunc illico circumvagantur, et inquirunt lupanaria, et illa, dum indicantur, etiam intrant; sunt haec a lateribus inferni; sed cum ibi non nisi quam prostibula offendunt, abeunt, et inquirunt ubi sunt virgines; et tunc feruntur ad scorta, quae per phantasiam sibi inducere possunt supereminentem pulchritudinem, ac floridum puellare decus, et jactare se virgines, ad quas similiter ut in Mundo ardent; quare cum his paciscuntur, sed cum potituri sunt pacto, phantasia inducta e Coelo aufertur, et tunc virgines illae apparent in sua deformitate, monstrosae et furvae, quibus tamen adhaerere ad horulam coguntur; scorta illa vocantur Sirenes.</p><p>[3] Sed si per tales fascinationes non patiuntur se a vesana illa libidine abduci, dejiciuntur in Infernum, quod in confinio meridiei et occidentis sub Inferno meretricum astutiorum est, et ibi adsociantur sodalibus suis. Datum etiam est videre illos in Inferno illo, ac mihi dictum est, quod ibi sint multi ex nobili stemmate, et ex opulentioribus; sed quia tales fuerant in Mundo, aufertur illis omnis recordatio stemmatis ac dignitatis ex opulentia, ac inducitur persuasio, quod fuerint vilia mancipia, et inde omni honore indigni.</p><p>[4] Inter se quidem apparent sicut homines, sed ab aliis, quibus licet illuc intueri, sicut Simiae, facie torva loco faciei blandae, ac vultu horrido loco vultus facetiarum; incedunt contracti a lumbis, et sic incurvati, superiore parte propendente antrorsum sicut proni ad lapsum, et maleolent: fastidiunt sexum, et ab illis, quas vident, avertunt se, est enim illis nulla cupido. Tales apparent in propinquo, sed e longinquo sicut Canes indulgentiarum seu Catuli delitiarum, et quoque sicut aliquid latratus auditur in sonis loquelae illorum. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: angelicis; </p>
