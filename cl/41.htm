<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第41节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>41、⑺主的话是指属灵的婚姻，即复活后人不娶也不嫁。这些话可见于福音书：<br><br>有几个撒都该人常说没有复活的事，他们问耶稣说，夫子，摩西为我们写着说，人若死了，没有孩子，他兄弟当娶他的妻子，为哥哥生子立后，有弟兄七人，他们一个个都娶她为妻，但都死了，没有孩子，后来妇人也死了。这样，当复活的时候，她是哪一个的妻子呢？耶稣回答说，这世界的人有娶有嫁，惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人，也不娶也不嫁，因为他们不能再死，和天使一样，既是复活的人，就为神的儿子。至于死人复活，摩西在荆棘篇上称主是亚伯拉罕的神，是以撒的神，是雅各的神。神原不是死人的神，乃是活人的神，因为在祂那里，人都是活的。（路加福音20：27-38，马太福音22：23—32，马可福音12:18—27）<br><br>主以这些话教导了两件事：第一，人死后会复活。第二，人在天堂没有婚嫁。主说神原不是死人的神，乃是活人的神，并且亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各仍旧活着，是在教导人死后会复活。关于地狱里的财主和天堂里的拉撒路的寓言（路加福音16：19—31）同样教导了这一点。<br><br>第二，主说惟有算为配得那世界的人，也不娶也不嫁，是在教导人在天堂没有婚嫁。这里的婚姻仅指属灵的婚姻，这一点从接下来的话清楚可知：他们不能再死，因为他们和天使一样，既是复活的人，就为神的儿子。属灵的婚姻就是与主的结合，该结合在世上完成。当在世上实现结合时，也就在天上实现了它。所以，天堂不再有婚姻，人们也不娶也不嫁。以下这些话也是这个意思：“这世界的人有娶有嫁，惟有算为配得那世界的人，也不娶也不嫁。”这种人是主所说的“陪伴之人”（马太福音9：15，马可福音2：19），以及此处的“天使”，“神的儿子”和“复活之人”。<br><br>结婚就是与主结合，参加婚礼就是被主接入天堂。这一点从以下经文明显可知：<br><br>天国好比一个王为他儿子摆设娶亲的筵席，就打发仆人去，请人来赴席。（马太福音22：2，3—14）<br><br>天国好比十个童女，出去迎接新郎（其中有五个为婚礼预备好了）。（马太福音25：1）<br><br>新郎就是主自己，这一点从以下经文明显可知：<br><br>你们要警醒，因为人子来的时候，那日子，那时辰，你们不知道。（马太福音25：13）<br><br>从启示录同样明显可知：<br><br>羔羊的婚期到了，祂的妻子也自己预备好了。凡被请赴羔羊之婚筵的有福了。（启示录19：7，9）<br><br>主所说的每句话都有灵义，这在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（1763年出版于阿姆斯特丹）中已予以充分说明。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>41、（7）主所说的精神上的婚姻就是说，在复活以后人们不会再有规定了的婚姻。福音中有以下的篇章：</p><p>撒都该人常说没有复活的事。他们问耶稣说：“夫子，摩西说：‘人若死了，没有孩子，他兄弟当娶他的妻子，为哥哥生子立后，’从前在我们这里，有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，死了，没有孩子，撇下妻子给兄弟。第二个，第三个，直到第七个都是如此。后来，妇人也死了。这样，当复活的时候，她是七个人中那一个人的妻子呢？”</p><p>耶稣回答说：“今天的人们结婚或被安排结婚。但是那些保持婚姻价值的人，在复活以后不再结婚或被安排结婚。他们也不会再死去，因他们和天使一样，是复活的人，是神的孩子。另外复活了的人，摩西称主是亚伯拉罕的神，是以撒的神，是雅各的神。”神不是死人的神，而是活人的神，因为在神那里人都是活的。（《路加福音》20:27-38，《马太福音》22:23—32，《马可福音》12:18—27）。</p><p>主的话告诉我们以下两点。第一，人死后会复活；第二，在天堂中，人们不再有被规定了的婚姻。</p><p>主通过“神不是死人的神，而是活人的神”，亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各仍然活着。寓言中地狱里的富人和天堂里的拉撒路也还活着（路加福音16:19—31）。</p><p>（2）主通过“那些保持婚姻价值的人，在复活以后不再结婚或被安排结婚，告诉我们在天堂中不会有被规定了的婚姻。这里所讲的婚姻是指精神上的婚姻。这在以下的话语中清晰可见。他们不会再死去，因为他们就像是天使，是神的孩子，是复活了的人。</p><p>精神的婚姻是指与主相联，这是在世间时取得。一旦在世间获得了，就也在天堂中得到了。所以在天堂中不再有婚姻，人们也不会被安排而结婚，这就是以下这些话的意思。“今天的人结婚或被安排结婚。但是那些保持婚姻价值的人，在复活后不再结婚或被安排结婚。”</p><p>这些人被称做“结婚了的人”（马太福音9:15，马可福音2:19），在这里他们称做“天使，神的孩子，复活了的人。”</p><p>（3）结婚意思是与主相联，参加婚礼意思被主接收到天堂中，这体现在以下段落中：天上的王国好像一个作王的人为儿子举行婚宴，他派仆人出去请人来赴宴。（马太福音222:3—14）。</p><p>天国好像十个童女……出去迎接新郎（有五个将要参加婚礼）（马太福音25:1），主的意思在以下一段中清楚地表明：</p><p>保持清醒，因为你们不知道神的孩子什么时辰什么日子到。（马太福音25:13），同样在启示录中：</p><p>羔羊婚娶的时候到了，他的新娘也准备好，祝福那些出席婚宴的人。（启示录19:7、9）</p><p>主所讲的每句话都有其神圣的含义。这在The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Scripture（阿姆斯特丹1763）中有所说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #41 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>41. (vii) The Lord's statement that after the resurrection people are not given in marriage refers to spiritual weddings.<p>We read in the Gospels:<p>Some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, asked Jesus, saying, Master, Moses wrote, 'If a man's brother who has a wife dies, and he is childless, his brother is to marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.' There were seven brothers each of whom, one after the other married a wife, but they died childless. At length the woman too died. In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? But Jesus in reply told them, The children of this world marry and are given in marriage. But those who will be judged worthy of reaching the other world and rising again from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. For they can no longer die, for they are like angels and sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. But the resurrection of the dead was proved by Moses calling the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. But God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for him all are alive. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_23.htm">Matthew 22:23-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_18.htm">Mark 12:18-27</a>.<p>The Lord made two points in this teaching; first that people rise again after death, and secondly, that they are not given in marriage in heaven. Resurrection after death was proved by God being not the God of the dead, but of the living, and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive; and further by the parable of the rich man in hell and Lazarus in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_22.htm">Luke 16:22-31</a>).</p><p>[2] The second point, that people are not given in marriage in heaven, was proved by the words 'those judged worthy of reaching the other world do not marry or are given in marriage.' It is plain this means spiritual weddings because of the immediately following words, 'they can no longer die, because they are like angels and sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.' A spiritual wedding means being linked with the Lord, something that happens on earth, and if it has taken place on earth, it has also taken place in heaven. The wedding therefore cannot be repeated in heaven, nor can they be given in marriage again. This is the meaning of these words, 'The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage. But those judged worthy of reaching the other world neither marry nor are given in marriage.' These people are also called by the Lord 'the sons of the wedding' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a> <sup >1</sup>); and in this passage 'angels,' 'sons of God' and 'sons of the resurrection.'</p><p>[3] Marrying is being linked with the Lord, and going in to a wedding is being received into heaven by the Lord. This is plain from these passages. The kingdom of the heavens is like a royal personage who made a wedding for his son, and sent out his servants with invitations to the wedding (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>). The kingdom of the heavens is like the ten maidens who went out to meet the bridegroom, five of whom were ready and went in to the wedding (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a> ff). It is clear that the Lord here meant Himself from verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_13.htm">13</a> of this chapter, which says, 'Keep awake, because you do not know the day or the hour at which the Son of Man will come.' Also from the Book of Revelation:<p>The time of the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready. Blessed are they who are summoned to the wedding feast of the Lamb. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is a spiritual meaning in everything the Lord said, as was shown fully in THE TEACHING OF THE NEW JERUSALEM ABOUT THE HOLY SCRIPTURE, published at Amsterdam in 1763. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #41 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>41. 7. Spiritual marriage is meant by the Lord's words, that after the resurrection they are not given in marriage. In the Gospels we read the following:<p>Some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection..., asked Jesus, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote...that if anyone's brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.... There were seven brothers, (and one after another they took her as wife, but they died childless).... Lastly...the woman died also. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of them does she become...?"<p>But Jesus, answering, said to them, "The children of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who shall be held worthy to attain the second age, and the resurrection from the dead, shall neither marry nor be given in marriage; nor can they die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. Moreover, that the dead rise again, even Moses showed in reference to the bush, when he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' So, then, He is not God of the dead but of the living, for all live to Him." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>; cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_23.htm">Matthew 22:23-32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_18.htm">Mark 12:18-27</a>)<p>The Lord taught two things by these words. First, that a person rises again after death. And secondly, that people are not given in marriage in heaven.<p>He taught that a person rises again after death by saying that God is not God of the dead but of the living, and that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are still alive. So likewise in the parable about the rich man in hell and Lazarus in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>).</p><p>[2] Secondly, He taught that people are not given in marriage in heaven by saying that those who are held worthy to attain the second age neither marry nor are given in marriage.<p>The only kind of marriage meant here is spiritual marriage, and this clearly appears from the words that immediately follow, that they cannot die any more because they are like the angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.<p>By spiritual marriage, conjunction with the Lord is meant, and this is achieved on earth. And when it has been achieved on earth, it has also been achieved in heaven. Therefore in heaven the marriage does not take place again, nor are people given in marriage. This, too, is meant by the words, "The children of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are held worthy to attain the second age neither marry nor are given in marriage."<p>Such persons are also called by the Lord, "children of the wedding" <sup >1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>), and here, "angels," "children of God," and "children of the resurrection."</p><p>[3] To marry means to be conjoined with the Lord, and to go to a wedding means to be received into heaven by the Lord. This appears from the following references:<p>The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who arranged a wedding for his son, and sent out his servants (with invitations to a wedding). (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_2.htm">Matthew 22:2</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_3.htm">3</a>, to verse 14)<p>The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins, who...went out to meet the bridegroom (five of whom were prepared to go to the wedding). (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a> ff.)<p>The Lord meant Himself in this passage, which is apparent from the thirteenth verse there, where it says,<p>Stay awake..., because you know not the day and the hour in which the Son of Man will come. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_13.htm">Matthew 25:13</a>)<p>Also from the book of Revelation:<p>The time for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.... Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>)<p> <p>There is a spiritual meaning in each and every thing the Lord said, and this we fully showed in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture (published in Amsterdam in 1763). <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Actually, "children of the bridechamber." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #41 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>41. 7. The Lord's statement that there are no weddings after resurrection was about spiritual marriages. We read this in the Gospels.<p>Certain Sadducees, who deny resurrection, questioned Jesus, saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote that if someone's brother, with a wife and no children, is dead, his brother should take his wife and raise children for his brother. There were seven brothers.<p>One after the other they took the wife but died childless. In the end, the woman died, too. So which one's wife does she become in the resurrection?"<p>But in answer Jesus told them, "The children of this time celebrate weddings and give away in marriage. But those who will measure up to the next age and the resurrection from the dead will neither have weddings nor give away in marriage. For they can no longer die, for they are like the angels and are God's children. For they are the children of rebirth. But that the dead rise, even Moses showed, at the burning bush, when he called the Lord Abraham's God and Isaac's God and Jacob's God. For He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. For everyone lives in Him." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_23.htm">Matthew 22:23-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_18.htm">Mark 12:18-27</a>)<p>The Lord taught two things by these words - first, that people rise again after death, and second, that there are not marriages in heaven.<p>He taught that people rise again after death by saying that God is not the God of the dead but of the living and that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive. He teaches it again in the parable of the rich man in hell and Lazarus in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_22.htm">Luke 16:22-31</a>).<p>The second thing - that there are not marriages in heaven. He taught by these words, "But those who will measure up to the next age ... will neither have weddings nor give away in marriage."<p>The words that come next - that they cannot die any more because they are like the angels and sons of God when they are children of the rebirth - show clearly that He was referring to no weddings other than spiritual weddings. "Spiritual weddings" refers to conjunction with the Lord, and this is made on earth.<p>Once made on earth it is also made in heaven, so weddings are not made again in heaven, nor "giving away in marriage." This is also how to understand the words, "The children of this time have weddings and give away in marriage. But those who will measure up to the next age neither have weddings nor give away in marriage." The Lord also calls them "children of weddings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>). In this passage He calls them "angels," "children of God," and "children of rebirth."<p>Clearly in the following passages "to have a wedding" is to be conjoined with the Lord, and "to go to a wedding" is to be received in the kingdom of heaven by the Lord:<p>In Matthew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_1.htm">22:1-14</a>) the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who held a wedding for his son and sent servants with invitations to the wedding.<p>In Matthew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">25:1-13</a>), the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who went out to meet the bridegroom, and the five of them who were ready went in to the wedding. It is clear from <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_13.htm">25:13</a>, where it says, "Watch ... for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming," that this refers to the Lord.<p>And in Revelation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>), the time "for the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready .... Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding supper of the Lamb!"<p>The Doctrine for the New Jerusalem Concerning the Sacred Scriptures (published in Amsterdam in the year 1763) fully explains that there is a spiritual meaning in every single word that the Lord spoke. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #41 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>41. VII. THAT SPIRITUAL NUPTIALS ARE MEANT BY THE LORD'S WORDS, THAT AFTER THE RESURRECTION THEY ARE NOT GIVEN IN MARRIAGE. In the Gospels are found these words:<p>Certain of the Sadducees who deny the resurrection, asked Jesus, saying, Master, Moses wrote, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother shall take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. There were seven brethren, one after the other of whom took the wife; but they died childless. At last the woman died also.<p>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of them shall she be? But Jesus, answering, said unto them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; but they which shall be accounted worthy to attain to another age, and the resurrection from the dead, shall neither marry nor be given in marriage; neither can they die any more; for they are like unto angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. But that the dead rise again, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_23.htm">Matthew 22:23-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_18.htm">Mark 12:18-27</a>.<p>There are two things which the Lord taught by these words: First, that man rises again after death; and second, that in heaven they are not given in marriage. That man rises again after death, He taught by saying, that God is not the God of the dead but of the living, and that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are living. He also taught the same in the parable of the rich man in hell and Lazarus in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_22.htm">Luke 16:22-31</a>).</p><p>[2] The second point, that in heaven they are not given in marriage, He taught by the statement, that those who are accounted worthy to attain to another age neither marry nor are given in marriage. That here no other nuptials are meant than spiritual nuptials is very evident from the words which immediately follow: that they cannot die any more because they are like unto angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. By spiritual nuptials is meant conjunction with the Lord. This is effected on earth, and when effected on earth, it is effected in heaven also. Therefore, in the heavens they are not again married and given in marriage. This is also meant by the words, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but they which are accounted worthy to attain to another age, neither marry nor are given in marriage. They are also called by the Lord sons of the nuptials <sup >1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>); and, in the present passage, angels, sons of God, and sons of the resurrection.</p><p>[3] That marrying means being conjoined with the Lord, and that entering into marriage means being received into heaven by the Lord, is clear from the following passages: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, a king, who made a wedding for his son, and sent forth servants and invited to the wedding. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>.)<p>The kingdom of heaven is like unto ten virgins, who went forth to meet the bridegroom; of whom five, being prepared, went in to the wedding (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>).<p>From verse 13 in that chapter, where it is said, Watch, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh, it is evident that by the bridegroom, the Lord meant himself.<p>Also from the Apocalypse:<p>The time of the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. Blessed are they that are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>.<p>That there is a spiritual meaning in each and every word which the Lord spoke, is fully shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE, published in Amsterdam in the year 1763.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;According to the Greek text, this should be "sons of the bridechamber," as in the A.V. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #41 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>41. (vii) The Lord's words that "after the resurrection they are not given in marriage" refer to spiritual nuptials. We read in the Gospels:<p>Certain Sadducees, who deny the resurrection, asked Jesus, saying, Master, Moses wrote... If a man's brother die, having a wife, and himself is childless, the brother shall take the wife, and raise seed to his brother. There were seven brothers, of whom one after another took the wife; but they died childless;... finally the woman died too. In the resurrection whose wife of them all will she be? But Jesus said in reply, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those deemed worthy to attain another age and resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; for they can no longer die, but are like the angels and are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection. But that the dead rise again, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; for He is not God of the dead, but of the living; for to Him all are living. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_23.htm">Matthew 22:23-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_18.htm">Mark 12:18-27</a>).</p><p>[2] By these words the Lord taught two truths, first that the human being rises after death, and second, that they are not given in marriage in heaven. The first He taught in the words that God is not God of the dead but of the living, and that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are living - He taught the like in the parable of Dives in hell and Lazarus in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_22.htm">Luke 16:22-31</a>). He taught the other truth - that they are not given in marriage in heaven - in the words that those who are deemed worthy of attaining the other world do not marry nor are given in marriage. The reference is to spiritual nuptials, as what follows makes plain, namely, that they can no more die, being like the angels, and are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection. Spiritual nuptials are union with the Lord, and this union is effected on earth; accomplished there, it is accomplished for heaven. Hence men are not "wedded" in heaven, nor "given in marriage" there. The same is meant in the words "the sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those who are deemed worthy to attain the other age, neither marry nor are given in marriage." The Lord also calls them "sons of the marriage" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>), and here "angels," "sons of God" and "sons of the resurrection."</p><p>[3] That "to marry" is to be united with the Lord, and that to "enter on marriage" is to be received into heaven by the Lord, is plain from these words:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a king, who made a marriage for his son, and sent his servants forth and gave invitations to the marriage (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>);<p>"The kingdom of the heavens is like ten maidens, who went forth to meet the bridegroom;" of whom the five who were ready, entered into the marriage (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a> seq.)<p>In these words the Lord alluded to Himself, as is plain from verse 13, which reads,<p>Watch, for you know not the day and hour when the Son of man will come.<p>So in the Apocalypse:<p>The time of the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready: blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>).<p>In Doctrine of the New Jerusalem on the Sacred Scripture, published at Amsterdam in 1763, we have shown that there is a spiritual understanding in each and all things which the Lord said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #41 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>41. (7) That Spiritual Nuptials are meant by the Lord's words, that after the Resurrection they are not given in Marriage. In the Evangelists are found these words: -<p>Certain of the Sadducees which say there is no resurrection, asked Jesus, saying, Master, Moses wrote, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and without children, his brother shall take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were seven brethren, one after the other of whom took a wife; but they died without children. At last the woman died also. Therefore, in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? But Jesus, answering, said unto them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; but they which shall be accounted worthy to attain the other age, and the resurrection from the dead, shall neither marry nor be given in marriage; neither can they die anymore; for they are like unto the angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. But that the dead rise again even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_23.htm">Matthew 22:23-33</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_18.htm">Mark 12:18-27</a>).<p>There are two things which the Lord taught by these words: First, that man rises again after death; and secondly, that in heaven they are not given in marriage. That man rises again after death He taught by saying that, 'God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,' and that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive. He also taught the same in the parable of the rich man in hell and Lazarus in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_22.htm">Luke 16:22-31</a>); secondly, that in heaven they are not given in marriage, He taught by the words: 'They that shall be accounted worthy to attain the other age neither marry nor are given in marriage.' From the words which immediately follow, that they cannot die anymore, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection, it is very evident that no other nuptials are meant here than spiritual nuptials. By spiritual nuptials conjunction with the Lord is meant, and this is effected on earth; and when it has been effected on earth it has been effected in the heavens also; and therefore, they are not married and given in marriage again in the heavens. And this is also meant by the words, 'The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but they that are accounted worthy to attain the other age neither marry nor are given in marriage. They are also called by the Lord sons of nuptials' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>); and here angels, sons of God, and sons of the resurrection. That to be married is to be conjoined with the Lord, and that to enter into marriage is to be received in heaven by the Lord, is clear from the following passages: -<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, a king, who made a marriage for his son, and sent forth servants and invited to the nuptials (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>).<p>The kingdom of heaven is like unto ten virgins, who went forth to meet the bridegroom; five of whom that were ready went in to the nuptials (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, seq.).<p>It is evident from verse 13 there (where it is said, 'Watch, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh') that the Lord here meant Himself. Also from the Apocalypse: -<p>The time of the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready. Blessed are they that are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>).<p>That there is a spiritual meaning in all the words, and in every single word that the Lord spoke, is fully shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, published at Amsterdam in the year 1763. </p>

Apud Evangelistas leguntur haec, "Quidam Sadducaei negantes Resurrectionem interrogarunt Jesum, dicentes, 'Magister, Moses scripsit, si cujus frater mortuus fuerit, habens uxorem, isque improlis, ut ducat frater ejus uxorem, et exsuscitet semen fratri suo; fuerunt septem fratres, quorum unus post alterum, acceperunt uxorem; sed improles mortui sunt, demum etiam mulier; in Resurrectione ergo, cujus illorum fiet uxor.' Sed respondens Jesus dixit illis, 'filii saeculi hujus nuptias faciunt et nuptui dantur; qui vero digni habebuntur, ut Saeculum alterum consequantur, et resurrectionem a mortuis, neque nuptias facient, neque nuptui dabuntur, non enim mori amplius possunt, similes enim Angelis sunt, et filii Dei sunt, cum sunt resurrectionis filii.
