<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第2节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2、有一次，我看见一位天使在东方天堂下飞行，手里拿着号筒，朝北、西、南方吹响。他身上披的斗蓬随着他飞行而在身后飘动，束的腰带因镶有红宝石和蓝宝石而看似燃烧并发光。天使飞下来，轻轻落在我所站之处附近的地面上。他笔直着陆后，就来回踱步，然后看到我，就朝我走过来。我在灵里，在此状态下正站在南部地区的一个小山冈上。待他走近，我招呼他说：“发生什么事？我听到你的号声，见你从空中落下来。”天使回答说：“我奉差遣召集因学识渊博而最为著名，头脑最为敏锐，在智慧上名声赫赫的人。他们都来自基督教国家，就住在周边地区，要在你现在所站的这个山冈上聚会，畅所欲言，坦陈在世时对天上喜乐和永恒幸福的认识、理解和领悟。<br><br>“我承担这项使命是因为，一些尘世来的新人被准许进入我们东方天堂社群。据他们说，在整个基督教界，没有一个人知道何为天上的喜乐和永恒的幸福，因而不知道何为天堂。我的兄弟和同胞对此感到十分震惊，就对我说：‘你下去召集灵人界最有智慧的人（灵人界是所有人离世后首先聚集的地方），我们好通过众多声音了解一下基督徒对于永生是不是真的陷入如此浓密的黑暗和深深的无知。’”他又说：“稍等片刻，你会看到成群结队的智者纷至沓来，主必为他们预备聚会的大厅。”<br><br>我等候观望，半小时后，只见北、西、南方各来了两队人。他们一到，就被拿号筒的天使领进预备好的大厅，并坐在按地区指定给他们的位子上。一共有六组人；第七组在东方，但由于光线其他人都看不见。集合完毕，天使解释了召集他们的原因，并要求各组依次阐述他们关于天上喜乐和永恒幸福的智慧。接着，每组围成一圈，组员面对面，以便他们能忆起在世时对这个问题的看法，然后进行讨论，最后陈述各自结论。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>2、（1）我曾经见到一个天使在东边的天空中飞过，拿着支喇叭，朝四方吹着。他穿着件披风，飞行时，披风被吹到了后边，他佩带着有深红和蔚蓝颜色的饰带，那饰带闪着火一般的光。</p><p>水平方向飞着，面向前方和下方，他慢慢地落到我周围的地面上。直立在地上，然后开始来回地走，看到我以后，向我走来。我处于精神之中，此时我正站在南部区域的一座山上。</p><p>当他走近时，我与他讲话问道：“什么事？我听到你的喇叭声，见你从空中落下来。”</p><p>天使回答说：“我被派来召集住在这里的来自于基督教国主度的那些以博学、智慧而著称的人们。我被派来召集他们到你所在的这座山上，让他们讲一下他们在世间时对天国之乐及永恒的幸福的理解。</p><p>（2）我这项任务的原因是，一些新来到我们天国东部的人说，整个基督教界，没有一个人知道天国之乐，永恒的快乐是什么，进而也就不知道天堂是什么。我的兄弟们对此十分吃惊，他们对我说：“到下面去，召集精神世界（所有死去的人离开人世后将要到的地方）中最有智慧的人，我们要证实是否真的处于黑暗之中，并且对来世一无所知。”</p><p>他又说：‘在这等一会，你会看到那些智慧的人。主将会为他们准备一个聚会的礼堂。</p><p>（3）我等待着，半小时后我看到两队人从北方走来，两队来自西方，两队来自南方。他们到达后，天使吹着喇叭将他们带到礼堂中，在那里，根据他们来自的区域，而被分配坐位。他们被分成六组，第七组来自东方，但因为光线而不能为其他人所见。</p><p>他们到齐之后，天使解释了召集他们的原因，天使让他们依次讲述他们对天国之乐及永恒的幸福的理解。每一组都聚成圆圈，面对面，以便回忆他们在前世时对此的理解，现在再考虑一下，然后阐述他们的结论。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #2 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>2. I once saw an angel flying under the eastern heaven holding a trumpet to his mouth with his hand, and sounding a blast towards the north, the west and the south. He was wearing a cloak which trailed behind him as he flew. He wore a sash studded with rubies and sapphires so that it seemed to flame and shine. He flew head first, and alighted gently on the ground near where I was. On landing he walked upright on his feet, going in different directions, and then on seeing me came towards me. I was in the spirit, and in that state was standing on a hill in the southern quarter.<p>When he was near, I spoke to him and asked: 'What is happening now? I heard the sound of your trumpet, and saw you come down through the air.'<p>'I have been sent,' the angel replied, 'to summon the most famous for their learning, the most perceptive minds and the names most renowned for wisdom, who come from Christian lands and are in this region, to meet together on this hill, where you are now standing, and to speak their minds, stating what, when in the world, they had thought, understood and regarded as wisdom on the subject of HEAVENLY JOY AND EVERLASTING HAPPINESS.</p><p>[2] 'The reason for my mission is that some new arrivals from the world, who have been admitted to our heavenly community in the east, have reported that not a single person in the whole of Christendom knows what heavenly joy and everlasting happiness are, and so what heaven is. My brethren and colleagues were very surprised at this and told me to go down, make proclamation and summon the wisest people in the world of spirits, the place where all mortals are first gathered together on leaving the natural world, so that we can be informed by a number of voices, whether it is true that Christians are in such dense darkness and deep ignorance about the life to come. Wait a little while,' he said, 'and you will see the groups of wise men arriving here; the Lord will prepare a hall for their meeting.'</p><p>[3] I waited and after half an hour I saw two parties coming from the north, two from the west, and two from the south. On arrival the angel with the trumpet took them into the hall which had been prepared, and there they occupied the places assigned to them in accordance with the quarter from which they came. There were six groups or parties; there was a seventh from the east, but the light rendered them invisible to the rest. When they were assembled, the angel revealed the reason they had been summoned, and asked the groups in turn to set forth their wisdom on the subject of heavenly joy and everlasting happiness. Then each group formed a circle with faces turned in towards one another, so that they could recall the ideas they had had about it in the previous world, discuss them, and after discussion report on them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #2 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>2. I once saw an angel flying beneath the eastern sky holding a trumpet to his mouth, who sounded towards the north, towards the west, and towards the south. He was wearing a cape which swept backwards as he flew; and he was girded with a sash of garnets and sapphires that seemed ablaze with fire and light.<p>Flying in horizontal position, facing forward and down, he slowly descended to the tract of ground surrounding me. Landing upright upon his feet, he began to pace back and forth, and then seeing me he headed in my direction. I was in the spirit, and in this state was standing on a hill in the southern zone.<p>When he drew near, I spoke to him and asked, "What is happening? I heard the sound of your trumpet and saw you descending through the air."<p>The angel answered, "I have been sent to call together people most renowned for their learning, most discerning in their brilliance, and foremost in their reputation for wisdom, who have come from the kingdoms of the Christian world and are living in this surrounding land. I have been sent to assemble them on this hill where you are standing, to express their honest opinions as to what they had thought, understood and perceived in the world regarding heavenly joy and eternal happiness.</p><p>[2] "The reason for my mission is that some newcomers from the world, admitted into our heavenly society in the east, have told us that not even one person in the whole Christian world knows what heavenly joy and eternal happiness are, thus what heaven is. My brothers and companions were very surprised at this, and they said to me, 'Go down, call together and assemble the wisest in the world of spirits (the world into which all mortals are first gathered after they leave the natural world) in order that we may learn from the testimony of many whether it is true that Christians are in such darkness and unenlightened ignorance concerning the life to come.'"<p>He also added, "Wait here a little, and you will see companies of the wise streaming here. The Lord is going to prepare a hall of assembly for them."</p><p>[3] I waited, and behold, after half an hour I saw two bands of people coming from the north, two from the west, and two from the south. As they arrived, they were led by the angel with the trumpet into the hall prepared for them, where they took places assigned to them according to the zones they came from.<p>They formed six groups or companies. A seventh came from the east, but it was not visible to the others owing to the light.<p>After they were assembled, the angel explained the reason they had been called together, and he asked the companies to present in turn their wisdom regarding heavenly joy and eternal happiness. Each company then gathered into a circle, its members facing each other, in order to recall the ideas they had acquired on the subject in the previous world, to consider them now, and after conferring to present their conclusion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #2 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>2. Once I noticed an angel flying under the eastern sky, holding a trumpet to his mouth. He sounded it north, west, and south.<p>The robe he wore fluttered behind him, and was cinched with a band of rubies and sapphires that seemed to flash and sparkle. He swooped down and glided slowly to the earth near me. On landing he walked here and there and came up to me when he saw me. It was a spiritual experience, in which I was standing on a hill toward the south.<p>And when he was close, I spoke to him and asked, "What's happening now? I heard the sound of your trumpet and saw you come down through the air."<p>"I was sent to summon the most famous in learning, the most insightful talents, and those of highest reputation for wisdom, from all the countries of the Christian world, who are in this continent," the angel answered, "to meet on this hill where you're standing, and from within their souls to express their minds as to what they thought, knew, and sensed while in the world, about the joy of heaven and about eternal happiness.<p>"I was sent on this errand because our community in the eastern part of heaven has received some new arrivals from the world who say that not even one person in the whole Christian world knows what the joy of heaven is, or eternal happiness, nor therefore what heaven is.<p>"My brothers and friends were really amazed at this and said to me, 'Go down, give a call and summon the wisest in the world of spirits, where all human beings first gather after leaving the natural world, to get definite information from the mouths of many whether it is true that Christians have such a befogged, dark ignorance about the future life.'"<p>Then he said, "Wait a while and you will see crowds of wise people flocking this way. The Lord will get a hall ready for them to meet in."<p>I waited, and in a half hour I saw two groups from the north, two from the west, and two from the south! And as they arrived the angel with the trumpet ushered them into the hall that was ready, where they took their places according to their quarter of the compass. There were six groups or companies. A seventh, which the others could not see for the light, was from the east.<p>After they assembled, the angel explained the reason for the meeting and asked the groups to take turns presenting their wisdom about the joy of heaven and eternal happiness. And then each group formed a circle, each person facing another, to recall the ideas they had formed on this subject in their previous life, to clarify them, and after clarification, to speak out about them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #2 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>2. I once saw an angel flying beneath the eastern heaven, holding in his hand and at his lips a trumpet, which he sounded towards the north, towards the west, and towards the south. He was clad in a robe which streamed behind him as he flew, and was girt about with a sash, flaming and sparkling as though with rubies and sapphires. He flew down and alighted gently upon the earth near where I was standing. As he touched the ground he stood upon his feet and walked to and fro; then, seeing me, he directed his steps towards me. I was in the spirit, and in the spirit was standing upon a hill in the southern quarter. When he was close by, I spoke to him and asked: "What is going on? I heard the sound of your trumpet and saw you coming down through the air."<p>The angel answered: "I am sent to call together from the kingdoms of the Christian world, men dwelling in that region who are renowned for learning, penetrating in genius, and eminent in reputation for wisdom, that they may assemble on this hill where you are now standing, and, from their heart, may express their minds as to what had been their thought, understanding, and wisdom in the world, respecting heavenly joy and eternal happiness.</p><p>[2] The reason of my mission was this: Certain new-comers from the world, who were admitted into our heavenly society which is in the east, have told us that not a single person in the whole Christian world knows what heavenly joy and eternal happiness are, or, consequently, what heaven is. Greatly wondering at this, my brethren and companions said to me, "Go down, call together and assemble the wisest men in the world of spirits (in which all mortals are first gathered after their departure from the natural world), that from the mouth of many we may ascertain whether it is true that among Christians there is such great darkness and dense ignorance concerning the future life!" He then added, "Wait a little and you will see companies of the wise flocking hither. The Lord will prepare for them a hall of assembly."</p><p>[3] I waited, and lo, after half an hour I saw two companies from the north, two from the west, and two from the south. As they came, they were introduced by the angel of the trumpet into the hall which had been prepared for them, and there took the places assigned them according to the quarters. There were six companies or groups; a seventh, at the east, was not seen by the others on account of the light. When they were assembled, the angel disclosed to them the reason why they had been summoned, and asked that the companies, each in turn, would set forth their wisdom respecting heavenly joy and eternal happiness. After this, each company gathered in a circle, face to face, that they might recall this matter from among the ideas they had entertained in the former world, and then examine it, and after examination and consultation, present their conclusion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #2 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>2. On a time <sup >1</sup>I saw an angel flying beneath the eastern heaven, holding a trumpet to his mouth. He blew a blast to the north, to the west, and to the south. He wore a cloak which streamed behind him as he flew, and a girdle which flashed and shone as with rubies and sapphires. He flew downwards and descended gently to the earth near me, where he began to go erect on foot to and fro until, seeing me, he came toward me. I was in the spirit, and in that state was standing on a hill in the southern quarter. When he was close, I addressed him, and asked,<p>"What is going on? I heard your trumpet-blast and observed your descent through the air."<p>"I have been sent," he said, "to call together residents here from countries of the Christian world who are the most noted for learning, the most clear-sighted mentally, and the most eminent in reputation for wisdom. They are to assemble on this hill where you tarry, and to tell from the heart what thoughts, understanding and wisdom they had in the world about Heavenly Joy and Eternal Happiness.</p><p>[2] The reason I was sent is this. Some newcomers from the world who were received into our heavenly society in the east, reported that no one in all the Christian world knows what heavenly joy and eternal happiness are, or, consequently, what heaven is. My brothers and companions were amazed at this, and said to me, 'Go down, call together the wisest in the world of spirits (into which all mortals are first gathered after their departure from the natural world) and assemble them so that we may ascertain from the mouths of a number if it is true that such thick darkness and dense ignorance obtain among Christians about the future life'." The angel added, "Wait a little while, and you will see the companies of the wise flocking here. The Lord will prepare them an assembly-hall."</p><p>[3] I waited, and after half an hour beheld two bands approaching from the north, two from the west, and two from the south. When they had arrived, they were led by the angel trumpeter into the building prepared, and took places appointed them according to the quarter whence they came. There were six bands or companies. There was a seventh company from the east, but it was invisible to the others on account of the light. When all were assembled, the angel broached the reason for the convocation, and asked the companies to express in turn their wisdom about Heavenly Joy and Eternal Happiness. Thereupon each company arranged itself in a circle, with all facing one another, to recall the subject according to the ideas which they had formed in the world, and to review it, and after conference to give their conclusion.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Memorabilia following (<a href="2.htm">2-25</a>) occur again in <a href="../tcr/731.htm">True Christian Religion 731-752</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #2 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>2. I once saw an angel flying beneath the eastern heaven with a trumpet in his hand and to his mouth; and he sounded it to the north, to the west, and to the south. He was clad in a robe that waved behind him as he flew, and was girt about with a band flashing and sparkling as with rubies and sapphires. He flew downwards and descended slowly to the earth not far from where I was. As he touched the ground he stood upon his feet and walked to and fro; and then, seeing me he directed his steps toward me. I was in the spirit, and in that state was standing on a hill in the southern quarter. And when he came near I spoke to him, and asked:<p>'What is to come to pass now? I heard the sound of your trumpet and saw you descending through the air.'<p>The angel answered, ‘I am sent to call together the men most renowned for learning, of most penetrating genius, and most eminent reputation for wisdom, from the countries of the Christian world who are dwelling on this continent, that they may assemble on the hill where you now are, and from the heart express their minds as to what they had thought, understood, and conceived in the world, respecting Heavenly Joy and Eternal Happiness. The reason of my being sent was this: Certain new-comers from the world admitted into our heavenly society, which is in the east, have told us that not even one in the whole Christian world knows what heavenly joy and eternal happiness are, nor therefore, what heaven is. This my brethren and companions greatly wondered at, and they said to me, 'Go down, call together, and assemble the wisest in the world of spirits' (in which all mortals are first gathered after their departure from the natural world) 'so that from the mouth of many we may make sure whether it is true that there is among Christians such thick darkness and dense ignorance of the future life.' And he said, 'Wait a little, and you will see companies of the wise flocking hither. The Lord will provide them an edifice of assembly.' I waited, and lo! after half an hour I beheld two companies from the north, two from the west, and two from the south; and as they came they were conducted by the angel with the trumpet to the edifice provided, and took the places assigned them there according to the quarter from whence they came. There were six companies or groups. A seventh, from the east, was not seen by the others on account of the light. When they were assembled the angel disclosed to them the reason of their being called together, and requested that the companies would in order express their wisdom respecting Heavenly Joy and Eternal Happiness. And each company then gathered themselves into a circle, turned face to face, that they might recall this subject according to the ideas received in the former world, and now consider it, and after consideration and consultation present their conclusion. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #2 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>2. Quondam mihi visus est Angelus sub Coelo Orientali volans, cui tuba erat in manu et ad os, qui clanxit versus Septentrionem, versus Occidentem, et versus Meridiem: indutus erat chlamyde, quae ex volatu fluebat retrorsum, et cinctus erat fascia ex pyropis et sapphiris sicut flammante et lucente; pronus volabat, et demisit se lente in terram, quae mihi continens erat: ut tetigit terram, erectus super pede vadit huc illuc, et tunc me viso direxit gressum ad me; eram in spiritu, et in hoc stabam super colle in plaga meridionali; ac cum prope erat, alloquutus illum quaesivi, "quid rei nunc, audivi clangorem tubae tuae, et vidi descensum tuum per aerem;" Angelus respondit, "missus sum ad convocandum celebratissimos eruditione, perspicacissimos ingenio, ac eminentissimos nomine sapientiae, qui e Regnis Christiani Orbis super Continente hac terra sunt, ut in hunc collem, ubi tu commoraris, conveniant, et ex pectore expromant mentes, quid in Mundo cogitaverant, intellexerant, et sapuerant de Gaudio Coelesti, et de Felicitate Aeterna.</p><p>[2] Causa legationis meae fuit haec, quod aliqui novi advenae e mundo, in Coelestem nostram Societatem, quae in Oriente est, admissi retulerint, quod ne quidem unus in Universo Christiano Orbe sciat, quid Gaudium Coeleste, et Felicitas aeterna, ita quid Coelum: hoc fratres et consocii mei valde mirati sunt, et mihi dixerunt, 'descende, conclama et convoca sapientissimos in Mundo spirituum, in quem primum colliguntur omnes Mortales post excessum e Mundo naturali, ob finem, ut ex plurium ore certi reddamur, num veritas sit, quod talis caligo seu tenebrosa ignorantia sit Christianis de futura vita:'" et dixit, "exspecta paulum, et videbis cohortes Sapientum huc alluentes; Dominus praeparabit pro illis aedem conventus."</p><p>[3] Exspectavi, et ecce post semihoram vidi duas Turmas a Septentrione, duas ab Occidente, et duas a Meridie, et sicut venerunt, ab Angelo tubae introducti sunt in Aedem praeparatam, et ibi occupabant loca illis designata secundum plagas. Erant sex Turmae seu Cohortes; septima erat ab oriente, quae prae luce reliquis non visa est. Post congregationem aperuit Angelus causam convocationis, et rogavit, ut Cohortes in ordine expromerent suam sapientiam, de Gaudio Coelesti, et de Felicitate Aeterna: et tunc unaquaevis Cohors se glomeravit in orbem, faciebus ad facies conversis, ut illam rem ex ideis in priori Mundo captis revocarent, et nunc lustrarent, ac lustratam post consultationem expromerent. </p>
