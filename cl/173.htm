<h4 align="center"></h4><p>173、⒂妻子就这样将丈夫的形像接收到自己里面，由此觉察、看见并感受他的情感。上述原因证明：妻子将属于其丈夫智慧的事物，因而将其灵魂和心智的属性接收到自己里面，并以这种方式将自己从处女变成妻子。得出这一结论的理由如下:<br><br>①女人是从男人被造的。<br><br>②因此，她拥有一种与男人联结，可以说重新与男人联结的倾向。<br><br>③由于并为了与配偶联结，女人生来就是对男人的爱；她通过婚姻变得越来越是对男人的爱，因为她的爱不断将其思维专注于这个男人与她的联结。<br><br>④她通过关注男人生命的渴望而与这唯一的男人联结。<br><br>⑤他们通过包围并联结他们的气场联结，无论总体还是细节；这种联结取决于妻子所拥有婚姻之爱的性质，同时取决于丈夫当中接受这爱之智慧的性质。<br><br>⑥他们还通过妻子吸收丈夫的阳刚之气联结。<br><br>⑦从这些事实明显可知，丈夫的某种事物不断被转录到妻子里面，并注入她，如同她自己的。<br><br>由此可知，丈夫的形像是在妻子里面形成的；妻子由于该形象在自己里面觉察、看见并感受丈夫里面所发生的一切，因而可以说在丈夫里面感受她自己。这种觉察出自交流，看见出自观察，感受出自触摸。妻子通过用手掌触摸丈夫的脸、臂、手和胸来感觉她的爱被丈夫接受。这一切是大厅里的三个妻子和玫瑰园里的七个妻子透露给我的，如记事（156e，208，293，294节）所描述的那样。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>173、（15）妻子因此将丈夫的形象融入自身之中，并由此体会、观察、感受丈夫的情感。</p><p>从以上所述可见妻子们接受来自于丈夫的与智慧、灵魂、思想有关的因素，通过这些使自己成为一个妻子，参见以下陈述：</p><p>（1）女人来自于男人。</p><p>（2）因此，女人有与男人合二为一的倾向。</p><p>（3）因为并且为了与她的伴侣相结合，女人生来就是对男人的爱的一种形式。婚姻使女人更加成为爱的一种形式，因为在婚姻中她的爱全部投入她的丈夫以便使其与自己合二为一。</p><p>（4）她通过对配偶愿望的吸引而与其合二为一。</p><p>（5）婚姻中的双方通过围绕彼此的氛围而结合，这种氛围根据婚姻之爱的性质及接受这种爱的丈夫的智慧的性质而使二者完全地结合。</p><p>（6）婚姻中的双方通过妻子与丈夫的同化而结合在一起。</p><p>（7）由此可见丈夫身上的某种成份被不断地传递到妻子身上并且融入妻子身上，就好象它是属于妻子自身的一样。</p><p>因此，妻子们形成了一种对丈夫的形象的认识，通过这种形象，妻子们体会，感受丈夫，妻子们就好象是在丈夫之中一样。她通过彼此的交流而体会到丈夫，通过观察而看到丈夫，通过接触而感觉到丈夫得到了自己的爱——这些是在大厅中的三个妻子透露给我的。（参见155节，208、293和294节）</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #173 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>173. (xv) The wife thus receives in herself an image of her husband, and consequently perceives, sees and feels his affections.<p>The reasons adduced above lead to the proof that wives receive into themselves what belongs to their husbands' wisdom; that is, what is proper to their souls and minds, and thus they make themselves wives instead of virgins. The reasons required for this conclusion are as follows:<p>(a) Woman was created out of man.<p>(b) This engenders an inclination to unite herself and, as it were, to be reunited with her husband.<p>(c) As a result and to effect that union with her partner a woman is by birth the love of her husband; and she becomes more and more the love of him by marriage, because then love constantly concentrates its thoughts on linking her husband with herself.<p>(d) She is linked to her one and only man by the attention she pays to the desires of his life.<p>(e) The linking is achieved by means of the spheres enveloping them and uniting them, all over and in detail, depending on the quality of conjugial love the wives possess, and at the same time depending on the quality of the wisdom receiving that love among the husbands.<p>(f) Another linking is effected by means of the wives' making their husbands' strength their own.<p>(g) It is plain from these facts that something of the husband is constantly being copied into the wife, and it is imprinted on her as if it were hers.<p>From all these considerations it follows that an image of the husband is formed in the wife, which allows her to perceive, see and feel in herself what goes on in her husband, and thus, so the speak, to feel herself in him. The perception comes from communicating, the seeing from looking, and the feeling from touching. The wife feels her love being received by the husband by touching with her palms his cheeks, arms, hands and chest. This was disclosed to me by the three wives in the hall and the seven wives in the rose-garden, as described in the accounts of experiences [155b (156), <a href="208.htm">208</a>, <a href="293.htm">293-294</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #173 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>173. 15. A wife thus receives into herself an image of her husband, and from it perceives, sees and feels his affections. From the arguments presented above, it follows, as something already attested, that wives receive into themselves matters that have to do with the wisdom of their husbands, thus matters belonging to their souls and minds, and in this way, from being maidens, they turn themselves into wives. These are the arguments from which this follows:<p>1. Woman was created out of man.<p>2. Consequently, she has an inclination to unite and, so to speak, reunite herself with a man.<p>3. On account of and for the sake of that union with her mate, a woman is born a form of love for a man, and she becomes more and more a form of love for him by marriage, because her love then continually devotes its thoughts to joining her husband to her.<p>4. She is joined to her particular partner by appeals to his life's desires.<p>5. Married partners are joined together by the atmospheres surrounding them, which unite them overall and in every instance according to the nature of the conjugial love in the wives, and at the same time according to the nature of the wisdom receiving that love in the husbands.<p>6. Married partners are also joined together by assimilations of the husbands' powers by the wives.<p>7. From this it is apparent that something of the husband is constantly being transfused into the wife and infused in her as though it were hers.<p>It follows from all this that an image of the husband is formed in the wife, and that because of this image a wife perceives, sees and feels in herself the things that are in her husband, and herself therefore as being in him. She perceives from their communication; she sees from looking at him; and she feels from touching him. She feels the reception of her love by her husband from the touch of her hands upon his cheeks, arms, hands and breast - something that was revealed to me by the three wives in the hall, and by seven wives in a rose garden, spoken of in the narrative accounts. <sup >1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See nos. <a href="156.htm">155[r]</a>, <a href="208.htm">208</a>, <a href="293.htm">293-294</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #173 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>173. 15. In this way a wife accepts an image of her husband in herself, so she sees, perceives, and feels his feelings. It is evident from reasons given above that wives accept within themselves things that have to do with their husbands' wisdom and are part of their souls and minds, and this is how they change themselves from virgins to wives.<p>Here are the reasons why this logically follows: (a) Woman was created from man. (b) This implants an inclination to unite, and to reunite, so to speak, with a man. (c) From this union with her counterpart, and on account of it, a woman is the love of a man by birth and becomes more and more his love through marriage, because then love steadily concentrates on joining the man to herself. (d) Attentions to the life's wishes of her one husband join her with him. (e) The couple are joined by their surrounding atmospheres, which unite them wholly and in each part, according to what kind of married love the wives have and also according to what kind of wisdom their husbands have to receive the love.<p>(f) They are also joined by the wives' taking to themselves the husbands' vitality. (g) This makes it clear that something is always being transferred from husband to wife and is etched on her as her own.<p>As a consequence of all this, a husband's image is formed in a wife. From this image the wife perceives, sees, and feels in herself the things that are in her husband, so it is as if she felt herself in him. She perceives through communicating, sees by watching closely, and feels by touch. The three wives in their home and the seven in the rose garden (in the stories, nos. 155b, 208, 293-94) made it clear to me that a wife feels her husband receiving her love as their hands touch cheeks, arms, hands, and chests. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #173 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>173. XV. THAT THE WIFE THUS RECEIVES INTO HERSELF THE IMAGE OF HER HUSBAND, AND HENCE PERCEIVES, SEES, AND FEELS HIS AFFECTIONS. From the reasons adduced above, it follows as an attested truth that wives receive into themselves the things pertaining to the wisdom of their husbands, thus the properties of their souls and minds, and so, from being virgins, make themselves wives. The causes from which this follows are: <p>1. That woman was created from man. <p>2. That in her there is thus an inclination to unite and, as it were, reunite herself with man. <p>3. That from this union with her fellow pair and for the sake of it, woman is born the love of man, and by marriage becomes more and more the love of him inasmuch as her love is continually devoting its thoughts to the conjoining of the man to herself. <p>4. That she is conjoined to her only one by applications to the desires of his life. <p>5. That they are conjoined by the spheres encompassing them and uniting the one with the other, both universally and as to every single part, according to the nature of the conjugial love with the wives, and according also to the nature of the recipient wisdom with the husbands. <p>6. That they are conjoined also by the appropriation by wives of the virile forces of their husbands. <p>7. From which appropriation, it is clear that something of the husband is continually being transcribed into the wife and is inscribed upon her as her own. <p>From all this it follows, that an image of the husband is being formed in the wife, and from this image, the wife perceives, sees, and feels within herself the things which are in her husband, and thence, as it were, herself in him. She perceives from the communication, sees from the aspect, and feels from the touch. That from the touch, she feels the reception of her love by her husband in the palms of his hands, on his cheeks, arms, hands, and breasts, was disclosed to me by the three wives in the hall and the seven wives in the rose garden spoken of in the Memorable Relations [nos. 156 e, <a href="208.htm">208</a>,<a href="293.htm">293-294</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #173 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>173. (xv) The wife thus receives her husband's image in herself and thence perceives, sees and feels his affections. From the reasons given above it follows as proved that wives receive into themselves what is of the husbands' wisdom, thus what is proper to the husbands' souls and minds, and so from virgins make themselves wives. The reasons from which this follows are:<p> <p>1. Woman was created from man.<p> <p>2. As a result she has an inclination to unite or, as it were, reunite herself with man.<p> <p>3. From that union with her counterpart and for the sake of it, woman is born the love of the man, and becomes more and more his love through marriage, because love then employs her thoughts steadily to conjoin him to her. <p> <p>4. She is conjoined to her only one through applications to his life's desires. <p> <p>5. They are conjoined by the enveloping spheres, which unite them in general and in particular according to the nature of the marital love with the wives and at the same time according to the character of the wisdom receiving it on the part of the husbands. <p> <p>6. They are also conjoined through appropriations of the husbands' powers by the wives. <p> <p>7. Plainly, then, something of the husband is steadily transcribed into the wife and inscribed on her as hers. <p> <p>From all this it follows that an image of the husband is formed in the wife, as a result of which she perceives, sees and feels in herself what is in the husband, and even feels herself in him. She perceives from communication, sees from vision, and feels from touch. The three wives in the hall, and the seven in the rose-garden, of whom in the Memorabilia <sup >1</sup>disclosed to me that a wife feels her husband's reception of her love from the touch of palms on cheeks, arms, hands and breasts.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="155.htm">155</a>, <a href="208.htm">208</a>, <a href="293.htm">293-294</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #173 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>173. (15) That the wife thus receives into herself the image of her husband, and thence perceives, sees, and feels his affections. From the reasons adduced above it follows as proven, that wives receive into themselves the things pertaining to the wisdom of their husbands, that is, the things which are proper to their souls and minds; and thus from virgins they make themselves wives. The reasons from whence this follows are: <p> <p>(1) That the woman was created from the man. <p> <p>(2) That thence there is an inclination in her to unite herself and as it were reunite herself with the man. <p> <p>(3) That from this union with her companion, and for the sake of it, the woman is born the love of the man; and becomes more and more his love by marriage, because then the love continually employs its thoughts about conjoining the man to herself. <p> <p>(4) That she is conjoined to her only one by applications to his life's desires. <p> <p>(5) That they are conjoined by the spheres which encompass them and which unite themselves, universally and singly, according to the quality of conjugial love with the wives, and at the same time according to the quality of the wisdom that receives it on the part of the husbands. <p> <p>(6) That they are conjoined also through appropriations by wives of the powers of the husbands. <p> <p>(7) Whence it is clear that something of the husband is continually transcribed into the wife, and is inscribed upon her as her own. <p> <p>From all this it follows, that an image of the husband is formed in the wife; from which image the wife perceives, sees, and feels within herself the things that are in her husband, and thence as it were, herself in him. She perceives by communication, sees by look, and feels by the touch. That she feels the reception of her love by the husband by the touch in the palms, upon her cheeks, arms, hands, and breasts, the three wives in a hail and the seven wives in a garden of roses disclosed to me; of which in the Relations. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #173 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>173. XV: Quod sic Uxor imaginem sui Mariti recipiat in se, et inde percipiat, videat, et sentiat ejus affectiones. Ex causis supra allatis sequitur ut testatum, quod Uxores recipiant in se illa, quae sunt sapientiae maritorum, ita quae sunt propria animarum et mentium illorum, et sic faciant se ex virginibus uxores: causae ex quibus hoc sequitur, sunt, <sup>1</sup>1. Quod foemina creata sit ex viro. 2. Quod inde inclinatio se uniendi et sicut reuniendi cum viro insit. 3. Quod ex illa unione, et propter illam cum suo compari, foemina nascatur amor viri, et fiat plus et plus amor ejus per conjugium, quia tunc amor impendit jugiter cogitationes suas ad conjungendum sibi virum. 4. Quod conjungatur Unico suo per applicationes ad vitae ejus desideria. 5. Quod conjungantur per sphaeras circumstipantes, ac unientes se universaliter et singulariter secundum quale amoris conjugialis apud uxores, et simul secundum quale sapientiae recipientis illum apud maritos. 6. Quod etiam conjungantur per appropriationes virium maritorum ab uxoribus. 7. Ex quibus patet, quod jugiter aliquid mariti transcribatur in uxorem, et ei inscribatur sicut ejus. Ex his et illis consequitur, quod imago mariti formetur in uxore, ex qua imagine uxor percipit, videt et sentit illa quae in marito sunt, in se, et inde sicut se in illo; percipit ex communicatione, videt ex aspectu, et sentit ex tactu; quod sentiat receptionem sui amoris a marito ex tactu in palmis super genis, ulnis, manibus, et pectoribus, aperuerunt mihi tres uxores in Aula, et septem in Roseto, de quibus in Memorabilibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: sunt. </p>
