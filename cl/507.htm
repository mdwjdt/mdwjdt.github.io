<h4 align="center"></h4><p>507、⑴多样化的淫欲是指彻底放纵行淫的性欲。这种淫欲会渗透到那些在青春期就放松道德约束，身边又不乏大量妓女，尤其不存在支付这笔开销的财富问题的人当中。他们通过无节制的过度纵欲，在思想与女性做爱时毫无羞耻感，确认奸淫不是恶，并且绝不是罪而将这种淫欲植入并扎根在自己里面。随着这种淫欲在他们里面发展，它逐渐增长，直到他们渴求全世界的女人，想要成群的女人，并且天天都有一个新的。由于这种淫欲脱离了植入每个人的正常两性情爱，完全脱离了对一个异性的爱，也就是婚姻之爱，并作为爱的快乐投入心脏的外层，这种快乐既脱离又源于上述两种爱（即两性情爱和婚姻之爱），所以它深深扎根于皮肤之中，性能力衰退后，它仍留在触觉中。这类男人对犯奸淫毫不在意，因而视整个女性为一个公用妓女，视婚姻为经常光顾的妓女。因此，他们将不贞洁与贞洁混在一起，并因着这种混和而发疯。由此明显可知，此处所说的多样化的淫欲是指彻底放纵行淫的性欲。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>507、（1）在此向往多样性的淫乱是指变得无比放荡的情欲。这种情欲产生于那些年轻时缺乏道德束缚，又有大量的妓女在周围，并且他们有支付能力。通过无限制的情欲和对异性无耻的放荡行为并认为这样做是无罪的。以致于这种情欲根植于他们身上。</p><p>这种情欲会不断增长，他们会想拥有世上一切女人，并且每天都有新的。</p><p>这样，这种情欲就超越了普通的对异性的爱。跃过了只爱异性中一个的婚姻之爱的要求。最后那种情欲会处于皮肤之下，当能力丧失之后，它仍会存在于触觉之中。</p><p>这样的男人只是想着淫乱行为。他们将整个异性视为一群妓女。他们会将道德和非道德相混。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #507 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>507. (i) The lust for variety means an utterly dissolute lust for immoral behaviour.<p>This lust creeps into those who in adolescence have slackened the reins of modesty, and have had no lack of prostitutes, especially if they have not been without the wealth needed to meet the expense. They implant and root this lust in themselves by disorderly and unrestrained immorality, having no shame in thinking about making love to the female sex, and by convincing themselves that adultery is not an evil and certainly not a sin. As they go on this lust grows in them, until they desire every woman in the world, wanting hordes of them and a new one every day.<p>Since this lust springs out of the ordinary sexual love everyone has implanted in him, and to the greatest extent from the love of one of the other sex, which is conjugial love, and launches itself into the outer regions of the heart as the delight of love, which is separate but yet derived from them, it is therefore so deeply rooted in the skin, that after their powers have faded, it remains in the sense of touch. These people think nothing of committing adultery. So they think of the whole female sex as they would of a common whore, of marriage as the regular frequenting of prostitutes, so mixing up shamelessness with modesty that the confusion drives them mad. These considerations make it obvious what the lust for variety means here, an utterly dissolute lust for immoral behaviour. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #507 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>507. 1. By a lust for variety we mean a lust to fornicate that has become utterly dissolute. This lust insinuates itself in people who in adolescence loosened the bonds of morality, and for whom a supply of harlots was not lacking, especially if they had at the same time the means to pay their price. They implant and enroot this lust in themselves by excessive and unrestrained acts of licentiousness, by entertaining shameless thoughts in regard to love and the feminine sex, and by persuading themselves that adulteries are not evils and certainly not sins.<p>This lust increases as it progresses in them until they lust after all the women of the world and wish to have troops of them and a new one every day.<p>Since this lust breaks out of the confines of the normal love for the opposite sex implanted in every person, and altogether those of a love for one of the sex which is conjugial love, and casts itself into the outer regions of the heart, as a delight of love separated from those other loves and yet stemming from them, it becomes seated therefore in the outer coverings of the skin, and this so firmly that after its powers wane, it remains in the sense of touch.<p>Men of this character think nothing of adulterous affairs. Consequently they think of the entire female sex as a collective harlot and of marriage as collective harlotry. Thus they mix immorality with morality and as a result of the mixture become insane.<p>It is apparent from this what we mean here by the lust for variety, namely, that it is a lust to fornicate that has become utterly dissolute. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #507 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>507. 1. Lust for variety means a totally unrestricted lust for illicit sex.<p>This lust steals into people who have loosened the restraints of modesty in adolescence and who did not lack plenty of prostitutes, and, especially, money to be spent in quest of them. They planted and rooted this lust in themselves by disorderly and unlimited fornications, by shameless thinking about love of the feminine sex and by arguments that adulteries are not bad things, and certainly not sins. This lust in them grows as it goes on, until they desire all the women in the world, and until they want crowds of them, and a new one every day.<p>This lust banishes itself from the general love of the other sex implanted in every person, and totally from love of one member of the other sex - which is married love - and it injects itself into the outer parts of the heart as the delight of a love that is separate from those other loves and yet comes from them. So it becomes rooted in their skin so completely that it stays in their sense of touch after their potency fails.<p>They make nothing of adulteries, so they think of the whole feminine sex just the way they think of a common prostitute and think of marriage the way they think of common prostitution, so in this way they mix immodesty up with modesty, and they go crazy with the mixture.<p>These observations make it clear what lust for variety means here - a totally unrestrained lust for illicit sex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #507 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>507. I. THAT BY THE LUST OF VARIETIES IS MEANT THE UTTERLY DISSOLUTE LUST OF WHOREDOM. This lust insinuates itself with those who in their youth have loosened the bonds of modesty and have not lacked plenty of harlots, especially if there was no question of wealth to spend on them. They have implanted and enrooted the lust within themselves by inordinate and unlimited whoredoms, by shameless thoughts about love of the female sex, and by confirmations that adulteries are not evil and are by no means sins. In its progression with them, this lust takes such increase that they desire the women of all the world and troops of them and a new one every day. Since this love separates itself from the common love of the sex implanted in every man, and absolutely from the love of one of the sex which is conjugial love, and casts itself into the exteriors of the heart as the delight of a love separate from the above loves and yet derived from them, therefore it is so deeply enrooted in the cuticles, that after the virile powers have become enfeebled, it remains in the touch. Such men make nothing of adulteries, and therefore think of the whole female sex as of a common harlot, and of marriage as of common harlotry. Thus they mix unchastity with chastity, and are insane from the mixture. What is meant by the statement that the lust of varieties is the utterly dissolute lust of whoredom is thus manifest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #507 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>507. (i) By the lust for variety is meant an utterly dissolute lust of whoredom. This lust insinuates itself into those who in youth cast off the restraints of modesty and to whom a supply of prostitutes was not wanting, as when there is ample means to pay the hire. Such men plant and inroot this lust in themselves by inordinate and unlimited whoredoms, by shameless thoughts about love of the female sex, and by confirmations in the position that adulteries are not evils and not sins at all. This lust grows in them progressively until they desire all the women in the world and would have troops and a different woman daily. This lust tears itself away from the sexual love implanted in every man and completely away from the love of one of the sex which is marital love, and casts itself into the heart’s exteriors, as a delight of love severed through derived from those loves; it becomes so deeply rooted in the cuticle that it remains in the touch even after the virile powers have been enfeebled. These men make nothing of adulteries, think of the female sex in the aggregate as a harlot and of all marriage as whoredom, and thus mingle shamelessness with shame and from the confusion grow insane. It is evident from this what we mean here by the lust for variety, namely, a wholly dissolute lust of whoredom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #507 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>507. (1) That by the lust of varieties is meant the lust of scortation altogether unrestrained. This lust insinuates itself with those who in youth have loosed the restraints of modesty, and with whom there have not been wanting plenty of courtesans, especially if there was no lack of means to meet their demands. They implanted and inrooted the lust within themselves by inordinate and unlimited scortations, by shameless thoughts about the love of the female sex, and by confirmations that adulteries are not at all sins. As it goes on, the lust so increases in them that they desire the women of all the world, and would have a troupe, and a new one every day. Since this lust casts itself out from the common love of the sex implanted in every man, and altogether from the love of one of the sex, which is conjugial love, and casts itself into the exteriors of the heart as the delight of a love apart from them and yet of them, therefore, it is so inrooted inwardly in the cuticles that it remains in the touch after the bodily powers have become languid. They make nothing of adulteries, and therefore, think of the whole female sex as of a common strumpet, and of marriage as common prostitution, and so they mix immodesty with modesty and from the mixture are made insane. From this it is manifest what is meant by saying that the lust of varieties is the lust of scortation altogether dissolute. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #507 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>507. I. Quod per libidinem varietatum intelligatur libido scortationis prorsus dissoluta. Haec Libido insinuat se apud illos, qui in adolescentia relaxarunt vincula pudicitiae, et quibus copia meretricum non defuit, imprimis si nec opulentia impendendi quaestus: hanc libidinem inserunt et irradicant sibi per inordinatas et illimitatas scortationes, et per cogitationes nullius pudoris de Amore sexus foeminini, et per confirmationes quod Adulteria non sint mala, et prorsus non peccata. Haec Libido apud illos progrediendo crescit, usque ut foeminas totius Mundi cupiant, ac ut velint turmas, ac unam novam quotidie. Quoniam haec libido ejicit se ex amore sexus communi cuivis homini implantato, et prorsus ex amore unius e sexu qui est conjugialis, ac injicit se in cordis exteriora ut delitium amoris separatum ab illis, et tamen ex illis, ideo irradicatur cuticulis tam penitus, ut postquam elanguerunt vires, remaneat in tactu. Hi nihili faciunt Adulteria, quare de toto sexu foeminino cogitant sicut de communi Scorto, et de conjugio sicut de communi Meretricatu, et sic impudicitiam immiscent pudicitiae, et ex mixto insaniunt. Ex his patet, quid per Libidinem varietatum hic intelligitur, quod Libido scortationis prorsus dissoluta. </p>
