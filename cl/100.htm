<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第100节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>100、⑾男性和女性被造是要成为良善与真理的婚姻的真正形像。这是因为，男性被造是要成为对真理的理解，因而在形式上成为真理；而女性被造是要成为对良善的意愿，因而在形式上成为良善；双方从其至内层就被赋予合为一体的倾向（参看88节）。这二者就这样成为一个形式，该形式模仿了良善与真理的婚姻样式。之所以用“模仿”一词，是因为它与该样式并不完全一样，只是与之相似；事实上，在男人里面，与真理结合的良善直接来自主，而与这男人里面的真理相结合的妻子的良善则通过妻子间接来自主。因此，丈夫里面有两种善，一种是内在的，一种是外在的，这两种良善皆与真理结合，并通过真正的婚姻之爱使丈夫不断处在对真理的理解，进而处在智慧当中。有关该主题的详细内容可见于下文。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>100、（11）男性和女性从创世时就是善与真理相结合的体现。这是因为男性从创世时起就是真理的表现。女性则是善的意愿的表现。在两性之中深藏着合二为一的倾向（见88节），二者构成一个形象，仿佛是善与真理结合的形象。</p><p>我们说仿佛是善与真理的形象是因为它只是与其相似而非完全一样。因为在男人中与真理相结合的善直接来源于主，而男人中与其真理相结合的妻子善是通过妻子而间接地来自于主。因此这是两种不同的善，一个是内在的，一个是外在的，它与丈夫身上的真理相结合使得男人能一直理解真理，进而通过真正的婚姻之爱而处于智慧之中。</p><p>对于这一点，以后再做更多解释。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #100 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>100. (xi) Male and female were created to be a true likeness of the marriage of good and truth.<p>This is because the male was created to be the understanding of truth, and so a model of truth; and woman was created to be the willing of good, and so a model of good. Each had implanted at the inmost level a tendency to become joined into one (<a href="88.htm">88</a> above). So the two of them make up a single model, which imitates the model of the marriage of good and truth. The term 'imitates' is used because it is not the same, but resembles it. For the good which links itself with truth in the man comes directly from the Lord; but the wife's good, which links itself with truth in the man, comes to him indirectly from the Lord by way of the wife. There are, therefore, two kinds of love, one inward, one outward, which link themselves with truth in the husband. These ensure that the husband remains constantly able to understand truth, and so by means of truly conjugial love to be wise. But this will be discussed further in the following pages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #100 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>100. 11. Male and female were created to be the very image of the marriage between good and truth. This is because the male was created to be an expression of the understanding of truth, thus a picture of truth, and the female was created to be an expression of the will of good, thus a picture of good, and implanted in both from their inmost beings is an inclination to conjunction into one (see above, no. <a href="88.htm">88</a>). Thus the two together form a single image, which imitates the conjugial model of good and truth.<p>We say that it imitates this model, because it is not identical to it but similar. For the good that attaches itself to the truth in a man comes directly from the Lord, whereas the wife's good that attaches itself to the truth in a man comes from the Lord indirectly through the wife. Consequently there are two kinds of good, one internal, one external, which attach themselves to the truth in a husband and cause the husband to remain constant in an understanding of truth and so in a state of wisdom through the agency of truly conjugial love.<p>But more on this subject later. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #100 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>100. 11. Man and woman were created to be precisely the image of a marriage between good and truth. This is because a man is created to be a grasp of truth - that is, the image of truth - and a woman is created to be a desire for good - which is to say the image of good.<p>And both are gifted, from deep inside, with an inclination to join together into one (see no. 88 above), so the two make one image that is like the image of the marriage between good and truth. I say it is "like" this because it is not that identical thing but similar to it. The good that joins itself with truth in a man, you see, comes directly from the Lord, and a wife's good that joins itself with truth in a man comes from the Lord indirectly through the wife, so that there are two kinds of good, one inner and the other outward, that join themselves with the truth in a husband. And these give a husband a steady grasp of truth and the wisdom that comes from it through the real love in marriage. But more about this is coming later. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #100 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>100. XI. THAT THE MALE AND FEMALE WERE CREATED TO BE THE VERY FORM OF THE MARRIAGE OF GOOD AND TRUTH. The reason is because the male was created to be the understanding of truth, thus truth in form, while the female was created to be the will of good, thus good in form; from their inmosts, both are endowed with an inclination to conjunction into a one (see above, no. <a href="88.htm">88</a>). The two thus make one form, which emulates the conjugial form of good and truth. It is said that it emulates this form, because it is not the same but is like it; for, with the man, the good which conjoins itself with truth is from the Lord immediately, while the wife's good which conjoins itself with truth in the man is from the Lord mediately through the wife. Thus there are two goods, one internal, the other external, which conjoin themselves with truth in the husband, and by means of love truly conjugial make the husband to be constantly in the understanding of truth and thence in wisdom. But more on this subject in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #100 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>100. (xi) Male and female were created to be Me very form of Me marriage of good and truth, for the reason that the male was created to be an understanding of truth, thus truth in embodiment, and the female to be a will of good, thus good in form, and on both there has been impressed inmostly an inclination to conjunction into one (see above, n.88). The two thus make one form, which emulates the marital form of good and truth. It is said to emulate it, for it is not identical with it, but like it. For while the good which is conjoined with truth in the husband is immediately from the Lord, the wife's good which conjoins itself with truth in the husband, is from the Lord mediately through the wife. There are accordingly two goods, one internal, the other external, which conjoin themselves with truth in the husband; and they bring it about that the husband is constantly in an understanding of truth and so in wisdom through true marital love; but of this more in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #100 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>100. (11) That the male and the female were created to be the very form of the marriage of good and truth. The reason is that the male was created to be the understanding of truth, thus truth in form; and the female was created to be the will of good, thus good in form; and to both was imparted from the inmosts an inclination to conjunction into one, as may be seen above, n. <a href="88.htm">88</a>. The two thus make one form, which emulates the conjugial form of good and truth. It is said that it emulates this, because it is not the same but similar to it. For the good that conjoins itself with truth with the man is from the Lord immediately; but the good of the wife which conjoins itself with truth with the man is from the Lord mediately through the wife. Therefore, there are two goods, one internal the other external, which conjoin themselves with truth with the husband; and these effect that the husband is constantly in the understanding of truth and thence in wisdom through love truly conjugial. But more will be said on this subject hereafter. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #100 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>100. XI: Quod Mas et Foemina creati sint, ut sint ipsa Forma Conjugii boni et veri, est quia Mas creatus est, ut sit Intellectus veri, ita Verum in forma, et Foemina creata est ut sit Voluntas boni, ita Bonum in forma, ac utrique ab intimis indita est inclinatio ad conjunctionem in unum, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_100/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_88" target=_top>88</a>; <sup>1</sup>ita faciunt duo unam formam, quae aemulatur Formam conjugialem boni et veri. Dicitur quod hanc aemuletur, quia non eadem est, sed ei similis; Bonum enim quod se conjungit cum Vero apud virum, est a Domino immediate, at Bonum uxoris quod conjungit se cum Vero apud virum, est a Domino mediate per uxorem, quare sunt duo Bona, unum internum, alterum externum, quae conjungunt se cum Vero apud maritum; ac faciunt, ut maritus constanter sit in intellectu veri, et inde sapientia per Amorem vere conjugialem: sed de his in sequentibus plura.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: 88. </p>
