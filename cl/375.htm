<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第375节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>375、另外，在某些地区，有些家族比其他人更易罹患嫉妒之症。他们会把自己的妻子锁起来，严禁她们与男人交谈。为防止她们透过窗户看男人，他们还在窗子上安装能拉到底部的格子架。丈夫若找到怀疑的理由，会用死亡的威胁恐吓她们。还有其它种种严厉的处置方式，在这些情况下，妻子们会在嫉妒的丈夫们手上遭受折磨。造成这种嫉妒的原因有两个：一个是，他们在教会属灵事物上的思想遭到禁锢和压制；另一个是他们根深蒂固的报复欲。<br><br>关于第一个原因，即他们在教会属灵事物上的思想遭到禁锢和压制，其后果从前面给出的论证可推论出来，即：每个人的婚姻之爱都取决于他里面的教会状态，由于教会来自主，故这爱唯独来自主（130，131节）。所以，若靠近和乞求的是人，不论活人还是死人，而不是主，那么可知，就不会有与婚姻之爱行如一体的教会状态。若他们的心智因着恐怖监禁的威胁而被驱使敬拜，就更不用说了。由此造成的后果是，他们的思想及其言论遭到禁锢和压制；若出现这种情况，对教会的攻击或关于它的妄想就会流入进来。这只会带来一波妓女热和对妻子的寒流。正是这两种效应在一个人身上叠加，才造成了这种压制不住的嫉妒大爆发。<br><br>关于第二个原因，即他们根深蒂固的报复欲，这种欲望会使婚姻之爱的流注完全停顿，吸收并吞没它，将其天堂的快乐转化为报复的地狱快感，并且它所指向的最近目标就是妻子。从表面上看，那里的恶毒氛围似乎也是一个次要原因，因为它充满了周边地区的有毒气息。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>375、还有一些区域的人种会比别人更易嫉妒。他们将妻子关起来不准他们与别的男人接触，并以死威胁他们。</p><p>产生这种嫉妒的原因的两种，一种是对与教会相关的精神事物的隔离。另一种是内心存在的对施暴的热衷。</p><p>关于第一种可以从从前讲过的内容中知道，比如每个人的婚姻之爱都与他身上的教会状态有关（130节）因为教会来自于主，爱也来自于主（131节），所以当人们背离主而跟随活着的人，或死了的人时，他们身上就没有那种与婚姻之爱相联的教会的状态了。他们的头脑被禁闭，言语也封闭了。这种情况下，思想就会与教会相反。这就会产生轻浮的女人以及对配偶的冷漠。当这二者存在于一人之中时，就会产生火一下的嫉妒。</p><p>至于第二个原因，即对施暴的热衷，这会完全阻止婚姻之爱。将其变为仇恨，它会首先指向妻子。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #375 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>375. There also exist families in some regions which are more than others exposed to jealousy as an illness. They keep their wives locked up, peremptorily forbidding them to have any conversation with men, and stopping them looking out of windows at them by fitting downward-facing grills to the windows; and they frighten them with threats of death, if the suspicions they have aroused should reveal any reason for them. There are other kinds of severe treatment which wives in these case suffer at the hands of their jealous husbands. There are two reason for this kind of jealousy. One is the fact that their thoughts about the spiritual side of the church are held captive and strangled; the other is their deep-seated desire for revenge.</p><p>[2] As regards the first reason, the fact that their thoughts about the spiritual side of the church are held captive and strangled, its effects can be deduced from the demonstrations given above, that everyone's conjugial love depends on the state of the church with him, and since the church is from the Lord, that love comes only from the Lord (<a href="130.htm">130-131</a>). So when in place of the Lord, human beings either living or dead are approached and invoked, it follows that there is no state of the church with which conjugial love can act in unison. Even less so, when their minds are driven to that kind of worship by threatening them with dire imprisonment. The result of this is that their thoughts together with what they say are held captive and strangled; and if this happens, they are subject to the influence of attacks on the church or delusions about it. This can only lead to a wave of heat for whores and frost for a wife. It is the combination of both these effects in one person that produces such an irrepressible outburst of jealousy.</p><p>[3] As regards the second reason, the deep-seated desire for vengeance, this completely stops the inflow of conjugial love, absorbs and swallows it, and turns its heavenly pleasure into the hellish one of vengeance. The nearest target for this is against a wife. It also appears as if a malign atmosphere, impregnated with the poisonous effluvia of the surrounding district, is a subsidiary reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #375 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>375. There are, in addition, regional ethnic groups which suffer a jealous morbidity more than others. They imprison their wives, despotically keeping them from any converse with men, closing them off from the sight of men through the windows by covering these with hanging lattices, and terrifying them with threats of death if they should detect a reason for the suspicion they harbor. Likewise other hard things, which the wives there endure at the hands of their jealous husbands.</p><p>[2] The reasons for this kind of jealousness, however, are of two types. One is an imprisonment and suffocation of their thoughts in regard to spiritual matters connected with the church. The other is an inbred lust for exercising vengeance.<p>As regards the first reason, namely, an imprisonment and suffocation of their thoughts in regard to spiritual matters connected with the church, what effect this has may be concluded from what we have shown previously, that everyone's conjugial love depends on the state of the church in him (no. <a href="130.htm">130</a>), and because the church comes from the Lord, that that love comes solely from the Lord (no. <a href="131.htm">131</a>). Consequently, when, instead of the Lord, people turn to men living and dead and call on them, it follows that their state is not a state of the church with which conjugial love can be allied; and still less so when their minds are terrorized into that worship by threats of a horrible incarceration. So it is that their thoughts are forcibly imprisoned and suffocated, and at the same time their speech; and when these are suffocated, ideas flow in that are either contrary to the church or imaginary substitutes for the church. These in turn give rise to nothing else but a state of heat for loose women and icy coldness towards having a partner. And when these two exist in the same person, from them flows such an ungoverned fire of jealousness as described.</p><p>[3] As regards the second reason, namely, an inbred lust for exercising vengeance, this completely halts any influx of conjugial love, absorbs it and swallows it up, and turns its delight, which is a heavenly delight, into a delight in vengeance, which is hellish, and which is directed first of all at the wife.<p>From the appearance, it seems as well that the unwholesomeness of the atmosphere there, which is permeated by the poisonous exhalations of the surrounding area, may be a subsidiary cause. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #375 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>375. Also, in places there are families who suffer the disease of jealousy more than others. They shut wives up, tyrannically keep them from talking with men, guard them from men's sight by windows fitted with shutters to cover them, and terrify them with threats of death if a cherished suspicion finds a pretext, besides other hardships that wives in those places endure from their jealous husbands.<p>But there are two reasons for this jealousy. One is the captivity and stifling of thoughts in spiritual matters of religion. The other is an inner lust for revenge. As to the first reason, the captivity and stifling of thoughts in spiritual matters of religion, you can conclude what these things do from what was pointed out above that everyone has married love in keeping with the state of the church in him, and because the church is from the Lord, married love is from the Lord alone (nos. <a href="130.htm">130-131</a>). And so, when living and deceased people are approached and called upon instead of the Lord, the consequence is that there is not a state of the church that married love can act together with. And all the less when their minds are frightened into worship by threats of a cruel prison.<p>This causes their thoughts together with their speech to be violently imprisoned and stifled. With them stifled, the kind of things that are either against the church, or are fancied to favor the church, pour in. All that comes from all this is a burning for prostitutes and chill for a married partner. From these two things together in one person gushes an uncontrollable fire of jealousy like this.<p>As to the second reason, which is an inner lust for revenge, this totally thwarts the influence of married love, swallows it up, devours it, and turns its joy, which is heavenly, into the joy of revenge, which is hellish, and its closest target is a wife. It also seems that the malignity of an atmosphere heavy with poisonous vapors of the surrounding regions is a secondary reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #375 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>375. Moreover, in certain regions there are families which labor under the sickness of jealousy more than others. By them Wives are imprisoned, tyrannically withheld from converse with men, shut off from the sight of them by windows provided with lattices stretching [from top] to bottom, and are terrified by threats of death if the husband find reason for the suspicion he nurses; besides other hardships which wives there suffer from their jealous husbands. Of this jealousy there are two causes: One is the imprisonment and stifling of the thoughts in respect to the spiritual things of the Church, the other is an intestine lust for revenge.</p><p>[2] As regards the first cause--the imprisonment and stifling of the thoughts in respect to the spiritual things of the Church--its effects can be concluded from what has previously been demonstrated, namely, that every one has conjugial love according to the state of the Church with him; and that this love is from the Lord alone because the Church is from Him (nos. <a href="130.htm">130, 131</a>). Therefore, When men, living and dead, are approached and invoked in place of the Lord, it follows that there is no state of the Church with which conjugial love can act as one, and the less so when men's minds are terrified into that worship by threats of a frightful prison. Hence it comes to pass that their thoughts, and with them their speech, are violently imprisoned and suffocated, and with these suffocated, things flow in which are contrary to the Church or which, if they favor the Church, are imaginary. From all this, nothing else redounds but burning heat for harlots and icy cold for the consort. It is from these two together in one subject that this ungovernable fire of jealousy comes.</p><p>[3] As concerns the second cause, namely, an intestine lust for revenge, this entirely inhibits the influx of conjugial love, absorbs it, swallows it up, and turns its delight which is heavenly into the delight of revenge which is infernal; and the nearest object to which it is determined is the wife. Moreover, it is from appearance that the malignity of the atmosphere there, Which is impregnated with the virulent exhalations of the surrounding region, is a subsidiary cause. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #375 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>375. Some races in certain parts of the earth suffer more than others with a jealous morbidity. They imprison their wives, tyrannically keep them from talking with men, prevent them from being seen by men (covering windows with lattices), and terrify them with threats of death should a suspicion they cherish prove to have grounds; besides doing other hard things with which the jealous husband in these lands afflicts his wife. Of such jealousy there are two causes. One is the imprisonment and stifling of thought about the spiritual things of the Church. The other is an intestine lust for vengeance.</p><p>[2] As concerns the first reason - the imprisonment and stifling of thought about the spiritual things of the Church: how this must result can be concluded from what we showed above, that one's marital love is according to the state of the Church in him, and as the Church is from the Lord, that this love is to be had only from the Lord (n. <a href="130.htm">130-131</a>). When therefore, instead of the Lord, human beings living and dead are approached and supplicated, there is no state of the Church with which marital love can act as one; still less when people's minds are frightened into that worship by threats of a cruel prison. So it comes to pass that thought together with speech is forcibly imprisoned and stifled. When this happens, there inflows what is either against the Church or for it but imaginary. Either influx abounds only in heat toward harlots and frigidity toward one's partner; from the two together in one person there issues this ungovernable fire of jealousy.</p><p>[3] As for the second reason, which is an intestine lust for vengeance, this absolutely checks, absorbs and overwhelms the influx of marital love and turns its enjoyment which is heavenly into the enjoyment of revenge, which is infernal; this revenge is directed first of all at the wife. The malignity of the climate impregnated in these districts with virulent exhalations from the land, also seems to be a supplementary cause of jealousy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #375 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>375. There are also families of countries that beyond others are afflicted with the infirmity of jealousy. By them wives are imprisoned, imperiously debarred from converse with men, kept from their sight by windows with lattices extended adown them, and terrified by threats of death in case a cherished suspicion should find a cause; besides other severities which wives there endure from their jealous husbands. But of this jealousy there are two causes: One is the captivity and stifling of thoughts upon the spiritual things of the church; the other is an intestine lust for revenge. As to the first cause, the captivity and stifling of thought upon the spiritual matters of the church, what this effects may be concluded from things shown above. That conjugial love with everyone is according to the state of the church with him; and that, as the church is from the Lord, this love is from the Lord alone (n. <a href="130.htm">130</a>, <a href="131.htm">131</a>). When, therefore, in place of the Lord, men, living and dead, are approached and invoked, it follows that there is no state of the church with which conjugial love can act as one; and the less when their minds are affrighted into that worship by threats of horrible imprisonment. Thence it comes to pass that the thoughts, together with the speech, are violently made captive, and suffocated, which being suffocated such things flow in as are contrary to the church, or things imaginary that favor the church. From all which there cannot but come forth a surging heat for harlots, and icy cold for the married partner, from which two together, in one subject, such an ungovernable fire of jealousy issues. As regards the second cause, which is an intestine lust for revenge, this entirely inhibits the influx of conjugial love, absorbs it and overwhelms it, and its delight, which is heavenly, is turned into the delight of revenge, which is infernal; and the nearest determination of this is towards the wife. It is also according to appearance that the malignity of the atmosphere in those countries, which is impregnated with the virulent exhalations of the surrounding region, is a secondary cause. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #375 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>375. Dantur etiam familiae regionum, quae prae aliis aegritudine Zelotypica laborant; ab his uxores incarcerantur, imperiose detinentur a colloquio cum viris, arcentur ab aspectu illorum per fenestras, appositis cancellis deorsum protensis, ac terrentur minis mortis si suspicio fota deprehenderit causam; praeter alia dura, quae uxores a Zelosis suis maritis ibi patiuntur.</p><p>[2] Sed causae hujus Zelotypiae, sunt binae; Una est, captivitas et suffocatio cogitationum in Spiritualibus Ecclesiae; Altera est, intestina cupiditas vindictae: quod Primam causam, quae est captivitas et suffocatio cogitationum in spiritualibus Ecclesiae, attinet, <sup>1</sup>quid illa operatur, concludi potest a supra demonstratis, quod cuivis sit Amor conjugialis secundum statum Ecclesiae apud se, et quia Ecclesia est a Domino, quod ille Amor sit unice a Domino, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_375/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_130" target=_top>130-131</a>; cum itaque loco Domini, homines vivi et defuncti adeuntur et invocantur, sequitur quod non sit status Ecclesiae, cum quo Amor conjugialis unum potest agere; et eo minus, dum mentes illorum terrentur ad illum cultum per minas pro atroci carcere; inde fit, quod cogitationes una cum loquelis, violenter captiventur et suffocentur; quibus suffocatis, influunt talia, quae vel contra Ecclesiam sunt, vel imaginaria pro Ecclesia; ex quibus non aliud redundat, quam aestus pro scortis, ac gelu pro conjuge; ex quibus duobus simul in uno subjecto, talis indomitus Zelotypiae ignis profluit.</p><p>[3] Quod secundam causam, quae est intestina cupiditas vindictae, concernit, <sup>2</sup>haec prorsus inhibet influxum amoris conjugialis, absorbet illum, et deglutit illum, et jucundum ejus, quod est coeleste, vertit in jucundum vindictae, quod est infernale, et hujus proxima determinatio est ad uxorem.
