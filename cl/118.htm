<h4 align="center"></h4><p>118、⑵主还被称为父，教会被称为母。主被称为父，这从从以下经文明显看出来:<br><br>因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书9:6）<br><br>耶和华啊，你是我们的父，从万古以来，你名称为救赎主。（以赛亚63:16）<br><br>耶稣说:人看见我，就是看见那差我来的父。（约翰福音12:45）<br><br>你们若认识我，也就认识我的父；从今以后，你们认识他，并且已经看见祂。（约翰福音14:7）<br><br>腓力说:求主将父显给我们看。耶稣对他说:人看见了我，就是看见了父，你怎么说将父显给我们看呢？（约翰福音14:8，9）<br><br>耶稣说，我与父原为一。（约翰福音10:30）<br><br>凡父所有的，都是我的。（约翰福音16:15;17:10）<br><br>父在我里面，我在父里面。（约翰福音10:38;14:10，11，20）<br><br>《揭秘启示录》一书已充分说明，主与祂的父为一，就像灵魂与肉体为一；父神从天而降，取了人的样式，是为了赎回和拯救人类；其人的样式就是那称为被差到世上来的圣子。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>118、（2）主被称为父，教会被称为母，参见以下段落：</p><p>《以赛亚书》9:6，63:16；《约翰福音》12:45，14:7，14:8-9，10:30，16:15，17:10，10:38，14:10，11，20）</p><p>（我们在The Apocalypse Revealed中讲述了主及父是一体，就象灵魂与身体是一体一样，父神从天国以人身来到世间来拯救人类，他的人身被称为子）。</p>
