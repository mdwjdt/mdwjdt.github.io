<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第42节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>42、对此，我补充两个灵界记事。记事一：<br><br>一日清晨，我举目望天，看见广袤的穹苍层层相叠。当我细看时，先是最近的第一穹苍打开了，然后是上面的第二穹苍，最后是顶上的第三穹苍。在它们的光照下，我意识到，形成第一穹苍的天使在第一层天（底层天），形成第二穹苍的天使在第二层天（中层天），形成第三穹苍的天使在第三层天（顶层天）。起先，我不知为何有此景象，又意味着什么。尔时，我听见天上仿佛有吹号的声音，说：“我们发觉并看出你正默想婚姻之爱，世人至今不知何为婚姻真爱，它的起源或本质是什么，也知道当前尘世间已无人明了婚姻真爱的起源和本质。然兹事体大，你们理当知晓。为此，主乐意向你开启层层天堂，让启示之光照彻你心，使你获得悟性。天堂的天使，特别是第三层天的天使，快乐尤其源自婚姻之爱。得主允许，我们为你请来一对天使，让你开开眼界。”<br><br>随即有一辆马车从第三层天（顶层天）驶下来，里面似乎有一位天使。驶近以后，才发现原来是两位。从远处看，这辆马车闪耀着钻石般的光芒，拉车的是雪白的马驹。一对夫妇坐在马车里，手上托着一对斑鸠。他们向我呼喊：“你希望我们靠近吗？但请留意，不要让我们天堂闪烁的强光射透。凭借这光，你的悟性必得到启发，得以领悟属天的奥秘。但在尘世，这些是无以言表的。所以，你当用理性思考所听到的话，并在理性的层面上加以解释。”“我会注意，请过来吧。”我回答说。他们就近前来，乃是一对夫妇。他们说：“我们是夫妻。从远古时代，就是你们所说的黄金时代开始，我们就在天堂幸福地生活，始终保持花样的青春年华，正如你现在看到的一样。”<br><br>我近前仔细观察两位天使，因为我发现他们在生命和装饰上都彰显着婚姻之爱的形像。在生命上，是反映在脸上；在装饰上，是反映在服饰上。因为所有天使都是显为人形的爱之情感。其主导情感从他们脸上透现出来，正是他们的情感赋予并决定了他们的服饰。所以，天堂有这样的说法：人皆以情感为衣。丈夫看似在少年和壮年之间。他的眼睛炯炯有神，闪烁着爱之智慧的光芒。这光使他的脸由内而外透出光芒，皮肤也闪闪发光，显得白里透红。因此，他的整张脸就是一道爱的光辉，神采奕奕，极其英俊。他身穿及脚踝的长袍和蓝色内袍，腰间束着金带，金带上嵌有三颗宝石：两边各有一颗蓝宝石，中间一颗红宝石。他的长袜是闪亮的细麻和银丝交织而成，鞋子是纯丝绸的。这是丈夫身上彰显的婚姻之爱的形像。<br><br>在妻子身上，婚姻之爱的形像乃是这样：我看她的脸，似见非见：见其美到极致；似乎不见，因为这美无以形容。她红光满面，只有第三层天的天使才透出这般眩目的光彩，令我震撼。妻子注意到我的神情，对我说：“你看到什么了？”我说我只看到婚姻之爱和它的形像，然而似见非见。闻言她从丈夫稍稍侧身，我就看得更加仔细了。她的眼睛闪烁着第三层天的荣光。我说过，第三层天的光是灿烂夺目的。所以她眼中的荣光，乃是从爱慕智慧的心流现出来的。在第三层天，妻子因丈夫的智慧，以及对它的回应而深爱着丈夫，丈夫因妻子对其智慧的热爱，以及对这爱的回应而深爱着妻子，于是二人融为一体。妻子因此美到极致，绝非艺术家所能描摹。因为这种流光溢彩的美非艺术所能表达，非笔墨所能描摹。她的发型优美，其风格与她的美丽相得益彰，上面插着宝石花的发簪。另外，她颈上戴着一串红宝石项链，链子上挂着玫瑰花状的橄榄石吊坠，腕上戴着珍珠手链。她外着朱红色长袍，内罩镶有红宝石的紫上衣。让我称奇的是，随着她面向丈夫角度的改变，宝石的颜色也随之改变，有时光耀，有时收敛：四目相接时光耀，彼此侧身时收敛。<br><br>经过这样一番观察，两位天使继续与我说话。丈夫说话的时候，仿佛也是代妻子说话。妻子说话的时候，仿佛也是代丈夫说话。因为他们心意相通，言语因此也相通。此时，我听到婚姻之爱的声音，这声音在他们的言辞中具有内在的和谐，它来自平安和纯真之乐。最后他们说：“他们在叫我们，我们得回去了。”他们又坐上马车，和之前一样，踏上一条花香满径的路，玫瑰花园中还长有硕果累累的橄榄树和橘子树。当他们快要到达自己的天堂时，有少女出来迎接，并簇拥他们进去。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>42、（1）就这一点，附上两段对精神世界的描述。首先：</p><p>一天清晨我向天空望去，看到天上无限广阔，一层又一层。这时候，最靠近我的一层打开了，接下来第二层，最后是最高一层第三层。在来自其中的光中我得知在第一层或者说是最低一层天堂的天使们，在第二层中的是第二层或者说中间层天堂的天使们，第三层中的是第三层天堂或者说最高层天堂的天使们。</p><p>开始时，我还在怀疑是怎么回事。后来我听到天堂中传来一个声音，像是喇叭声，说道：“我们知道你正在沉思婚姻之爱。然而，就我们所知，世间还没有人知道婚姻之爱的实质是什么。对此的了解对于世间的人很重要。所以，主很高兴将天堂向你敞开。这样，你就会得到光亮，进而理解。</p><p>“在我们中间，尤其是第三层天堂中，我们的欢乐主要来自于婚姻之爱。所以，在得到准许后，我们将派一对夫妇给你，以便使你亲眼见到。”</p><p>（2）突然间，一驾车从第三层，也就是最高层中驶来，我看到里面有一个天使。它走近后，我看到里面坐着两个天使。</p><p>马车在远处闪闪发光，像钻石一样。驾车的马像雪一样白。夫妇的手中是一对斑鸠。</p><p>这对夫妇对我说道：“你想要我们走近些，但你要小心我们带来的天堂之光。因为光线极强，你要当心它不要刺穿你。但是它的贯入，会使得你的高一层的思想得以启迪，这些思想是天国的思想。但是这些在你所生活的世界里无法得以表述。接受你将要听到的事物，在理智的前提下得以理解。”</p><p>我答复道：“我会当心的，靠近些吧。”</p><p>他们过来了，看哪，那是丈夫和妻子。他们说：“我们结婚了，我们从一开始就得到了祝福，也就是你们所说的黄金时代起，我们一直都青春常在。”</p><p>（3）我走近仔细地看了看这对夫妇，因为我觉得他们的生活，他们的装束代表着婚姻之爱。在他们的脸上，衣着上得到体现。因为所有的天使都是以人的形式存在的爱。最主要的，突出的情感在他们的脸上，衣着上得到体现。所以，在天堂中，人们说，每个天使都穿着他自身的情感。</p><p>丈夫看上是青年男子的模样。他的眼睛里闪烁着爱的智慧，在这种光亮之中他的脸好像是内在地放着光芒，因为光是来自于其中，他的皮肤发着光，因此，他的面容极为英俊。</p><p>他穿着长袍，在长袍下穿着件蓝色的衣服，腰部系着束带，两边挂着蓝宝石，中间镶着红宝石，他穿着麻制袜子，里面织有银丝。他的鞋子是丝绸制成的。</p><p>这就是婚姻之爱在丈夫的装束上的象征性体现。</p><p>（4）关于妻子，是以下的形式。我看了她的脸，但却没有看到它。我看到了真正的美，没有看到它是因为它的美无话用语言表达。她的脸上放射着最高的天堂中的光，截断了我的视线，我惊讶的像是失去了知觉。</p><p>看到这种情景，妻子问我说：“你看到什么了？”</p><p>我回答说：“我看到了婚姻之爱及它的样子。但是我看到了却又没看到。”</p><p>这时，她转了转身，于是我能更仔细地看一看，她的眼睛里放着天堂里的光芒，这种光来自对智慧的爱。因为在第三层天堂中的女人们因为她们丈夫的智慧而爱他们，并因此而行为。丈夫们因妻子对他们的爱而爱他们，并因此而行为。这样他们二者便结合为一了。。</p><p>妻子们也因而美丽。这种美丽没有一个艺术家能够描绘,美丽是无法用艺术来表达的。</p><p>她的头发极美妙地盘着，中间插着珠宝制的花。她戴着红宝石项链，上面挂着橄榄的玫瑰花型饰物。她还戴着珍珠手链。身穿红色裙子，紫色束身衣，前面系着红宝石。令我吃惊的是，因为她朝向她丈夫的角度的不同，她穿着的颜色也在变化。饰物所闪烁的光也在变化。夫妻俩相面对时，光亮更强，相互转开时，光亮就变弱。</p><p>（5） 看完这些以后，夫妻俩又与我交谈起来。当丈夫讲话时，他好像同时也代表着妻子。当妻子讲话时，她同时也代表着丈夫。因为他们的思想是统一的，所以他的言语也是这样。我就是这样得知婚姻之爱的，得知它内在上是如何的统一，得知由此而来的平和及纯真。</p><p>最后，他们俩说：“他们招唤着我们回去呢，我们得走了。”</p><p>他们象来时一样，坐着马车沿着两边长满玫瑰，橄榄及桔子的小路回去了。当他们走近他们天堂时，年轻的姑娘们出来欢迎他们并将他们带回去了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #42 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>42. I shall append here accounts of two experiences from the spiritual world, of which this is the first.<p>One morning I looked up into heaven and saw above me one broad level above another, and as I watched, the first level near to me was opened up, and then the second above, and finally the third, which was the highest. I was enlightened by this so as to grasp that the angels forming the first or lowest heaven were on the first level, those forming the second or middle heaven on the second level, and those forming the third or highest heaven on the third level.<p>At first I wondered what this meant and why it so appeared; and then I heard a voice like the sound of a trumpet coming out of heaven, which said, 'We have noticed and now see that you are meditating about conjugial love. We know that so far no one on earth knows what truly conjugial love is in its origin and essence, important though it is to know this. It has therefore pleased the Lord to open up the heavens to you, so that the light which enlightens may flow into the inner levels of your mind and allow you to perceive it. Our celestial delights in the heavens, especially the third, are chiefly from conjugial love. We have therefore been given permission to send down a married couple for you to see.'</p><p>[2] Then suddenly there was to be seen a chariot coming down from the highest or third heaven, containing what seemed to be one angel. But as it approached, it seemed to have two angels in it. The chariot seen from afar sparkled like a diamond, and had harnessed to it foals as white as snow. The travellers riding in the chariot held in their hands two turtle-doves, and they called out to me, 'You would like us to come closer, but be careful then that the fiery radiance, which is from the heaven we come down from, does not strike too deep. It will certainly enlighten the higher concepts in your intellect, which are in themselves heavenly. But these are inexpressible in the world where you now are. So understand rationally what you are about to hear, and so explain this to your intellect.'<p>'I will be careful,' I replied, 'come closer.' They did so, and turned out to be a husband and wife. 'We are a married couple,' they said. 'We have led a blessed life in heaven from the earliest time, which you call the Golden Age. We have been perpetually in the bloom of youth, in which you see us today.'</p><p>[3] I gazed at them both, because I realised that in their life and their adornment they were a picture of conjugial love. Their lives were to be seen from their faces, their adornment from their dress. For all angels are affections of love in human form. Their ruling affection shines out from their faces, and it is their affection which provides and determines what they wear. So in heaven there is a saying, everyone is dressed by his affection. The husband looked to be of an age half way between an adolescent and a young adult. Sparkling light glittered from his eyes, an effect of the wisdom of love; this light made his face shine with a kind of internal radiance, and this radiation made his skin shine on the outside, so that his whole face was a single lovely splendour. He was dressed in an ankle-length robe, over a blue garment with a gold belt, decorated with three gems, a sapphire at either side and a carbuncle at the centre. He wore stockings of shining linen with silver threads in the weave, and pure silk shoes. This was the picture presented by conjugial love in the husband.</p><p>[4] In the wife it appeared like this. I saw her face and at the same time I did not see it. It looked like Beauty itself, but I could not see it because this is inexpressible. Her face shone with fiery light, the light the angels in the third heaven enjoy, and this dazzled my sight, so that I was simply amazed. When she noticed this, she spoke to me. 'What can you see?' she asked. 'I can see nothing but conjugial love and the form it takes,' I answered. 'But I both see and don't see.'<p>At this she turned sideways on to her husband, and then I could gaze at her more fixedly. Her eyes flashed with the light of her heaven, a fiery light, as I have said, which derives from the love of wisdom. For the love wives have for their husbands in that heaven comes from and is focussed on their wisdom, and the love husbands have for their wives comes from and is focussed on that love for themselves, so that it unites them. As a result her beauty was such that no painter could ever rival it or render it in its true appearance, for his colours lack radiance and his art has no means to express her loveliness. Her hair was beautifully dressed in an arrangement which had a meaning by correspondence, and it had flowers in it made of jewelled settings. Her necklace was of carbuncles, and from it hung a rosary of gold-coloured gems, and she had pearl bracelets. She was dressed in a red gown over a purple blouse, fastened at the front with rubies. But I was surprised to see that the colours changed as she turned towards or away from her husband, and this too made them sparkle more or less, more when they looked at each other, less when not directly facing.</p><p>[5] When I had seen this, they spoke with me again; and when the husband spoke, it was as if what he said came at the same time from the wife, and when the wife spoke, it was as if it came at the same time from her husband, so closely united were their minds, from which their utterances flowed. And I could also then hear the sound of conjugial love, which was in inward unison within their speech, and arose from the delights of a state of peace and innocence.<p>At length they said, 'We are being called back, we must go.' Then they were seen again riding in a chariot, as before. They drove along a paved road between flower-beds with olive-trees and trees laden with orange fruit springing from them. When they approached their own heaven, maidens came out to welcome them and escort them in. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #42 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>42. To this I will append two narrative accounts from the spiritual world. Here is the first:<p>One morning I looked up into the sky, and I saw above me expanse upon expanse. And as I looked, the first or nearest expanse was opened, and shortly the second, which was above it, and finally the third, which was the highest of all. By the light coming from them I perceived that on the first expanse were angels of the first or lowest heaven, on the second expanse were angels of the second or middle heaven, and on the third expanse were angels of the third or highest heaven.<p>I wondered at first what was happening and why. But shortly I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of a trumpet, saying, "We have perceived, and now see, that you are meditating on conjugial love. Moreover, we know that so far no one on earth knows what true conjugial love is in its origin or in its essence, and yet it is important for them to know. Therefore it has pleased the Lord to open the heavens to you, that the inner faculties of your mind may receive an influx of illuminating light and thus perception.<p>"Among us in heaven, especially in the third heaven, our heavenly delights come principally from conjugial love. Consequently, by permission granted us, we will send a married couple down to you, in order that you may see."</p><p>[2] And suddenly, then, a carriage appeared, coming down from the highest or third heaven, in which I saw a single angel. But as it drew near, I saw that it held two.<p>The carriage shone before my eyes in the distance like a diamond, and harnessed to it were young horses as white as snow. And the couple sitting in the carriage held in their hands a pair of turtledoves.<p>And the couple called out to me, "You want us to come closer. But beware, then, of the flashing light coming from our heaven, the heaven we descended from. It is a blazing light, and you must take care that it does not penetrate interiorly. By its influx, indeed, the higher ideas of your understanding are enlightened, ideas that, in themselves, are heavenly. But these same ideas are inexpressible in the world in which you live. Receive the things you are about to hear, therefore, in rational terms and so explain them to the understanding."<p>I replied, "I will take care. Come closer."<p>So they came, and behold, it was a husband and his wife. And they said, "We are married. We have lived a blessed life in heaven from the earliest time, which you call the golden age, remaining forever in the same flower of youth that you see us in today."</p><p>[3] I looked at the two of them closely, because I perceived that they represented conjugial love in their life and in their adornment - in their life as shown in their faces, and in their adornment as shown in the garments they wore. For all angels are affections of love in human form. The essential, dominant affection shines out from their faces, and they are given clothing on the basis of their affection and in accordance with it. Consequently, in heaven they say that everyone is clothed in his own affection.<p>The husband appeared to be between adolescence and early manhood in age. From his eyes flashed a light sparkling with the wisdom of love. His face seemed to be inmostly radiant with this light, and because of the radiance from within, outwardly his skin virtually shone. As a result, his whole facial appearance was singularly one of dazzling good looks.<p>He was dressed in a full-length robe, and under the robe he wore a blue-colored garment, which was tied about the waist with a golden girdle bearing three precious stones, two of them sapphires, one on each side, and a garnet in the middle. His stockings were of shining linen, into which had been woven threads of silver; and his shoes were made entirely of silk.<p>This was the representational form that conjugial love took in the case of the husband.</p><p>[4] In the case of the wife, however, it took the following form. I saw her face, and did not see it. I saw it as the very essence of beauty, and did not see it because the beauty was beyond expression. For there was in her face the bright glow of a blazing light, like the light possessed by angels in the third heaven, and this light dimmed my vision, so that I was simply stupefied by it.<p>Noticing this, the wife spoke to me, saying, "What do you see?"<p>I answered, "I see only conjugial love and a picture of it. But I see and do not see."<p>At this she turned at an angle away from her husband, and then I could look more intently. Her eyes flashed with the light of her heaven, which is blazing, as I said, and so takes its quality from the love of wisdom. For wives in the third heaven love their husbands on account of their husbands' wisdom and in response to it, and the husbands love their wives on account of and in response to that love directed towards them, and so they are united.<p>The wife had her beauty as a result of this, such beauty that no artist could reproduce it or portray it in its true form, for a flashing of light like that is not possible in the painter's colors, nor is such loveliness expressible in his art.<p>Her hair was attractively arranged in a style to match her beauty, with jewels in the form of flowers inserted into it. She had a necklace of garnets, from which hung a rosette of peridots. And she had bracelets of pearls. She was dressed in a scarlet gown, and under it a purple bodice fastened in front with rubies. But what surprised me, the colors kept changing depending on which way she was facing in relation to her husband, and their sparkle also kept changing accordingly, being now more, now less - more when they faced each other, and less when she faced away at an angle.</p><p>[5] When I had seen these things, they spoke with me again. And when the husband spoke, he spoke as though he spoke at the same time on behalf of his wife, and when the wife spoke, she spoke as though she spoke at the same time on behalf of her husband. For such was the union of their minds, from which comes their speech. It was then that I heard as well the way conjugial love sounds, how it was inwardly together with, and also the result of, the delights of a state of peace and innocence.<p>Finally they said, "They are calling us back. We have to go."<p>They then appeared to be again riding in a carriage, as before, and they were borne off along a road stretching out between flower gardens, from whose beds rose olive trees and trees full of oranges. And as they drew near their heaven, young women came to meet them and welcome them and take them in. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #42 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>42. I add to this two stories from the spiritual world. First this one:<p>Once in the morning I looked up into the sky, and above me I saw domed openings, one above another. And I noticed the first and nearest opening fold away, then another higher one, and finally a third, which was highest. And in the light coming from there I could tell that on the first level were angels who make up the first, or lowest, heaven, and on the second level were angels who form the second, or middle heaven, and on the third level were angels who form the third, or highest heaven.<p>At first I wondered what it was, and why, and then a voice like a trumpet sounded out of the sky. "We could tell you were thinking about married love," it said, "and now we see that you are. And we know that, so far, no one on earth knows what real married love is, as far as its origin and essence go. But it does make a difference to know this! So the Lord decided to open the heavens for you so the light that illuminates can flow into your inner mind and you will understand. For us in the heavens, especially in the third heaven, heavenly joys come mainly from love for marriage, so we have permission to send down a married couple for you to see."<p>Then what did I see but a chariot coming down from the highest, or third, heaven, and there seemed to be one angel in it.<p>But as it came closer I could tell there were two.<p>From a distance the chariot gleamed before my eyes like a diamond, and hitched to it were colts as white as snow. The couple sitting in the chariot had two turtledoves in their hands. They called to me, "You want us to come closer. But watch out that the fiery glare of our heaven, where we came down from, does not get very deep inside you. It will flood your higher mental perceptions with light - they are heavenly per se. But you'll never be able to describe them in the world where you are. So you'll have to take what you're going to hear rationally, and you'll have to express it the same way to be understood."<p>"I'll be careful," I answered. "Come nearer."<p>And they came closer, and they were a husband and his wife! "We are married partners," they said. "We have lived blessedly in heaven since the first Age, which you call the Golden Age, and always in the same flower of youth that you see us in today."<p>I looked closely at them both, because I could tell that they must represent married love in its life and in its outward splendor - in its life in their faces and in its outward splendor in their clothing. For all angels are feelings of love in a human form. Their most dominant feeling shines out from their faces, and they choose clothes by and according to their disposition. So in heaven the saying is that your disposition clothes you.<p>The husband's age seemed halfway between adolescence and young adulthood. In his eyes there flashed a sparkling light from his perceptiveness about love, which made his face seem to shine from within, and from its glow the surface of his skin fairly shone, so that his whole face was one bright elegance. He wore an ankle-length robe with a blue garment under it, and it was belted with a gold sash with three precious stones on it - two sapphires on the sides and a fiery stone in the middle. His stockings were shining linen with silver thread woven in, and his shoes were all silk. This was how the husband represented the form of married love.<p>But the wife represented it this way. I saw her face - and did not see it. I could see it as beauty itself, and I could not see it because this is inexpressible. For a flaming brightness was in her face - the kind of light that angels in the third heaven have - and it dulled my vision so I was somewhat dazzled.<p>Noticing this, she spoke to me and said, "What do you see?"<p>"All I see is married love and what it looks like," I said, "but I see and do not see!"<p>At this she turned partly away from her husband, and then I could look at her better. Her eyes sparkled with the light of her heaven, which, as I said, is flaming, and so it derives from a love of wisdom. In fact, wives in that heaven love their husbands on account of wisdom and in relation to their wisdom, and the husbands love their wives according to that love directed toward them and in relation to it, and this is the way they are united.<p>From this she had such beauty that no painter could try to capture the image of it, since his colors have no such vibrance nor his art the power to express such beauty. Her hair was done up becomingly to match her beauty, and flowers made of diamonds were stuck into it. Her necklace was of fiery stones with a rose drop of chrysolites, and her bracelets were of large pearls. She wore a scarlet gown with a purple blouse under it, buttoned in front with rubies. But what I admired was that the colors were variegated according to whether or not she was facing her husband and also were now more vibrant, now less, according to her glance - more when they faced each other and less when they looked aside.<p>After I saw these things they spoke to me again, and when it was the husband speaking it was just as if it came from the wife at the same time. When it was the wife it was just as if it came from the husband, for their speech sprang from such a unity of minds. And then I heard the speech of married love, too. It is inwardly simultaneous with the joy of their states of peace and innocence. And it comes from them, too.<p>In the end they said, "They're calling us back. We'll go now."<p>And then they appeared to ride in a chariot again, as before, and it carried them along a paved road between flower gardens. From the beds sprang olives and laden orange trees. And when they approached near their heaven, girls came to meet them on the way, greeted them, and led them in. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #42 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>42. To the above, I will subjoin two Memorable Relations from the spiritual world. First:<p>One morning, looking up to heaven, I beheld above me expanse upon expanse. And I saw that the first expanse, which was near-by, opened, and presently the second, which was higher, and lastly the third, which was the highest; and by enlightenment therefrom, I perceived that upon the first expanse were angels who form the first or lowest heaven; upon the second expanse, angels who form the second or middle heaven; and upon the third expanse, angels who form the third or highest heaven. At first I wondered what this was and why; and presently a voice as of a trumpet was heard from heaven, saying: "We have perceived and do now see that you are meditating on Conjugial Love; and we know that, as yet, no one on earth knows what love truly conjugial is in its origin and in its essence, yet it is important that this be known. Therefore it has pleased the Lord to open the heavens to you, that enlightening light and thence perception may flow into the interiors of your mind. With us in the heavens, especially in the third heaven, our heavenly delights are chiefly from conjugial love. Therefore, by leave given us, we will send down to you a married pair that you may see."</p><p>[2] And lo, a chariot was then seen descending from the highest or third heaven, and in it was seen a single angel, but as it drew near, two were seen. At a distance, the chariot glittered before my eyes like a diamond. Harnessed to it were young horses, white as snow; and they that sat in the chariot held two turtle-doves in their hands. They then called to me, saying: "You wish us to come nearer, but take heed that the scintillation from our heaven whence we have descended, and which is a flamy scintillation, do not penetrate interiorly. By its influx, the higher ideas of your understanding, which in themselves are celestial, are indeed illumined, but in the world in which you are, these ideas are inexpressible. Therefore, receive rationally what you are about to hear, and in the same way present it to the understanding."<p>I answered, "I will take heed; come nearer." They then drew near, and lo! it was a husband and his wife; and they said: "We are married partners. From the first age, called by you the Golden Age, we have lived happily in heaven and always in the same flower of youth in which you now see us."</p><p>[3] I observed them both attentively, for I perceived that they represented conjugial love in its life and in its adornment--in its life in their faces, and in its adornment in their apparel. All angels are affections of love in human form. Their ruling affection shines forth from their faces; and from their affection and in harmony with it are their garments appointed. Therefore it is said in heaven that every one is clothed with his own affection. The husband appeared to be of an age midway between adolescence and early manhood. From his eyes beamed a light sparkling from the wisdom of love, from which light his face was as though inmostly radiant, and by this radiation, the surface of his skin was as though refulgent. Thus his whole face was one resplendent comeliness. He was clothed in a long robe reaching to his ankles, and under the robe was a vestment of blue, girded with a golden girdle on which were three precious stones, two sapphires at the sides and a ruby in the middle. His stockings were of shining linen interwoven with threads of silver, and his shoes were of silk. Such was the representative form of conjugial love with the husband.</p><p>[4] As to the wife, her appearance was as follows: To me, her face was both visible and not visible--visible as beauty itself, and not visible because such beauty is inexpressible; for in her face was a splendor of flaming light like the light with angels of the third heaven, and this light so dulled my sight that I became merely stupified with amazement. Observing this, she spoke to me, saying: "What do you see?" I answered: "I see only conjugial love and its form; but I see and do not see." At this, she turned partly away from her husband, and then I was able to observe her more intently. Her eyes sparkled with the light of her heaven which, as was said, is flamy and therefore partakes of the love of wisdom; for in that heaven, wives love their husbands from their husband's wisdom and in that wisdom; and husbands love their wives from that love towards themselves and in it. Thus they are united. Hence her beauty--a beauty which no painter can emulate and portray in its form, there being no such sparkle in his colors; nor is such beauty expressible by his art. Her hair was gracefully arranged in correspondence with her beauty, and in it were inserted flowers consisting of diamonds. <sup >1</sup>She wore a necklace of carbuncles, from which hung a rosary of chrysolites; and she had bracelets of pearls. She was arrayed in a flowing robe of scarlet, under which was a stomacher of purple clasped in front with rubies. But what I marveled at, the colors varied according to her aspect towards her husband. According to this aspect, they also sparkled now more, now less, more When they faced each other directly, and less when their glance was somewhat aslant.</p><p>[5] When I had seen all this, they again spoke with me; and when the husband was speaking, he spoke at the same time as though from his wife, and when the wife, she spoke at the same time as though from her husband, such being the union of the minds from which the speech flowed; and then also I heard the sound of conjugial love, that it was inwardly simultaneous and, moreover, was a sound proceeding from the delights of a state of peace and innocence.<p>At last they said, "We are recalled; we must depart." And then, as before, they again appeared to be conveyed in a chariot, being conveyed along a road laid out between flower beds, from the borders of which rose olive trees and trees laden with oranges. And as they drew near their heaven, maidens came out to meet them and received them and led them in.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The text has diadematibus (of diadems), but the context indicates that this is an error for adamantibus, as is in the translation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #42 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>42. I add two Memorabilia from the spiritual world.<p>I<p>Looking up to heaven one morning I saw one expanse after another above me. As I watched, the first expanse, which was near by, opened, and presently the second which was higher, and finally the third which was highest. By enlightenment thence I perceived that on the first expanse were angels such as compose the first or lowest heaven; on the second expanse were angels of the second or middle heaven; and on the third expanse angels of the third or highest heaven. At first I wondered what it all meant, but I soon heard a voice from heaven as of a trumpet, saying:<p>"We perceived and see now that you are meditating on Marital Love. We know that as yet no one on earth knows what true marital love is in origin and in essence; and yet it is important that it should be known. The Lord has therefore been pleased to open the heavens to you, that illumination and perception from it may flow into the interiors of your mind. With us in the heavens, especially in the third heaven, our heavenly delights are chiefly from marital love. Having been given leave, we shall send down a married pair that you may see."<p>Thereupon there appeared, descending from the highest or third heaven, a chariot in which one angel was seen; but as it approached two were visible in it.</p><p>[2] At a distance the chariot glittered like a diamond before my eyes. Young horses, white as snow, were harnessed to it; and the occupants held two turtledoves in their hands. They called to me, saying:<p>"You wish us to come nearer. Be careful that the flame-like effulgence from our heaven whence we have descended, does not penetrate interiorly. The influx of it will indeed illuminate the higher ideas of your understanding, which are in themselves heavenly; but in your own world they are ineffable. Therefore receive rationally what you are about to hear, and explain it so to the understanding."<p>I answered, "I shall take care; come nearer."<p>They came, and lo! they were a husband and his wife.<p>"We are married partners," they said. "We have lived blessed in heaven since the first age, called by you the Golden Age; and always in the same flower of youth in which you behold us today."</p><p>[3] I observed them attentively, perceiving that they represented marital love, both in its life and in its adornment; in its life in their faces, and in its adornment in their apparel. For all angels are affections of love in human form; the ruling affection itself shines forth from their faces. And by the affection and according to it are garments appointed. They say in heaven therefore that a person's affection clothes him. The husband looked to be of an age between youth and early manhood. From his eyes beamed a light sparkling with the wisdom of love. His face seemed inmostly radiant from this light, and in the irradiation from it the very skin seemed refulgent. His whole face was one shining comeliness. He was dressed in a robe which reached to the ankles, and wore under this a blue garment, girded with a golden girdle with three precious stones on it, two sapphires at the sides and in the middle a carbuncle. His stockings were of shining linen interwoven with threads of silver; and his shoes were wholly of silk. This was the representative form of marital love with the husband.</p><p>[4] But with the wife it was this: I saw her face and did not see it. I saw it as beauty itself, and did not see it because this was inexpressible. For in her face was the flame-like light which is found with the angels of the third heaven, and it dazzled my sight. I was simply dumbfounded. Observing this she spoke to me, saying,<p>"What do you see?"<p>I answered, "I see only marital love and the form of it. But I see and do not see."<p>At this she turned herself obliquely from her husband, whereupon I was able to regard her more intently. Her eyes sparkled with the light of her heaven, which, as was said, is flame-like and derived from the love of wisdom. For in that heaven wives love their husbands for and in their wisdom; and husbands love their wives from and in that love toward themselves - and so they are united. Hence her beauty was a beauty no painter could emulate and portray in its form; for there is no such coruscation in his color, nor is any such symmetry expressible by his art. Her hair was gracefully arranged to suit her beauty, with diadems of flowers in it. She wore a necklace of carbuncles, and pendent from it a rosary of chrysolites; and she had bracelets of large pearls. She was dressed in a flowing red robe, and under this had a bodice of purple clasped in front with rubies. But, what astonished me, the colors varied according to her address to her husband, and according to it they were also now more, now less brilliant, more when the two turned toward each other, and less when they were partly turned away from each other.</p><p>[5] When I had observed these things they talked with me again, and when the husband was speaking he spoke as if at the same time from his wife; and when the wife was speaking she spoke as if at the same time from her husband; for such was the union of minds whence the speech came. I also heard the very utterance of marital love, inwardly coincident with, and also proceeding from, the delights of a state of peace and innocence.<p>At length they said, "We are recalled. We must go."<p>Once again they seemed to be conveyed in a chariot, and were borne along a paved way between flower-gardens around which stood olive trees and well-laden orange trees. As they approached their heaven young women came out to meet them, and received and conducted them in. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #42 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>42. To the above I will subjoin two Relations from the spiritual world. First:<p>One morning I was looking up to heaven and beheld above me expanse above expanse; and I saw that the first expanse, which was near, opened, and presently the second which was higher, and lastly the third which was the highest. And by illustration therefrom I perceived that upon the first expanse there were the angels who form the first or lowest heaven; upon the second expanse were the angels who form the second or middle heaven; and upon the third expanse were the angels who form the third or highest heaven. At first I wondered what and why it was. But presently a voice was heard from heaven as of a trumpet, saying:<p>'We have perceived and now see that you are meditating on Conjugial Love; and we know that as yet no one on earth knows what love truly conjugial is in its origin and in its essence; and yet it is important that it should be known. It has therefore, pleased the Lord to open the heavens to you, that illustrating light and thence perception may flow into the interiors of your mind. With us in the heavens, especially in the third heaven, our heavenly delights are chiefly from conjugial love. By permission given us we will therefore, send down to you a married pair that you may see them.'<p>And lo! a chariot then appeared descending from the highest or third heaven, in which one angel was seen; but as it approached two were seen in it. In the distance the chariot glittered like a diamond before my eyes. And young horses were harnessed to it, white as snow; and they that sat in the chariot held two turtle doves in their hands. And they called to me, saying:<p>'Do you wish us to come nearer? But have a care then that the effulgence from our heaven whence we have descended, and which is flaming, does not penetrate interiorly. By the influx of this the higher ideas of your understanding are indeed illustrated, which in themselves are celestial; but in the world in which you are these are ineffable. Receive therefore, what you are about to hear rationally, and so explain it to the understanding.' I answered, ‘I will take heed; come nearer.'<p>And they came, and lo! they were a husband and his wife.<p>And they said, 'We are married partners. From the first age, called by you the Golden Age, we have lived blessed in heaven; and always in the same flower of youth in which you see us to-day.' I observed them both attentively, for I perceived that they represented conjugial love, in its life and in its adornment; in its life in their faces, and in its adornment in their apparel. For all angels are affections of love in human form; their ruling affection itself shines forth from their faces. And from their affection and in harmony with it their garments are allotted. It is therefore, said in heaven that his own affection clothes everyone. The husband appeared to be of a middle age between youth and early manhood. From his eyes beamed forth a light sparkling with the wisdom of love. His countenance was as if inmostly radiant from this light, and by the irradiation from it the skin outwardly was as it were refulgent. Thence his whole face was one resplendent comeliness. He was clothed in a long robe that reached to the ankles, and under the robe a vestment of blue, and this was girded with a golden girdle on which were three precious stones, two sapphires at the sides and in the middle a carbuncle. His stockings were of shining linen interwoven with threads of silver; and his shoes were entirely of silk. This was the representative form of conjugial love with the husband.<p>But with the wife it was this: I saw her face and did not see it. I saw it as beauty itself, and did not see it because this was inexpressible. For there was a splendor of flaming light in her countenance, such light as is with the angels of the third heaven, and it dimmed my sight, so that I was simply struck with amazement. Observing this she spoke to me saying:<p>'What do you see?' I answered, ‘I see only conjugial love and its form. But I see and do not see.'<p>At this she turned herself partly away from her husband and then I could regard her more intently. Her eyes sparkled with the light of her heaven, which as was said is flaming, and therefore, flows from the love of wisdom. For in that heaven wives love their husbands from wisdom and in their wisdom; and husbands love their wives from and in that love toward themselves - and they are thus united. Hence her beauty, which was such as no painter could emulate and portray in its form; for there is no such luster in his color, nor any such beauty expressible by his art. Her hair was gracefully arranged in correspondence with her beauty, and had flowers inserted in it from diadems. She wore a necklace of carbuncles, and pendent from this a rosary of chrysolites; and she had bracelets of large pearls. She was arrayed in a flowing robe of scarlet, and under this had a stomacher of purple clasped in front with rubies. But, what was a marvel to me, the colors varied according to her aspect towards her husband, and also according to this they were now more now less brilliant, more when they mutually turned towards each other, and less when they were partly turned from each other.<p>When I had observed these things they spoke with me again, and when the husband was speaking he spoke as if at the same time from his wife; and when the wife was speaking she spoke as if at the same time from her husband; for such was the union of minds whence the speech flows. Then I heard also the tone of voice of conjugial love, that it was inwardly simultaneous with, and also proceeding from, the delights of a state of peace and innocence.<p>At length they said, 'We are recalled. We must depart.'<p>And then again they appeared to ride in a chariot as before, and were carried along a paved way among gardens of flowers, out of whose beds sprang olive trees and orange trees laden with fruit; and as they came near their heaven virgins came out to meet them, and received, and conducted them in. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #42 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>42. His subjiciam duo Memorabilia e Mundo Spirituali: Primum hoc: Quodam mane suspexi in Coelum, et vidi supra me Expansum supra Expansum; et vidi, quod aperiretur Primum Expansum, quod prope erat, et mox Alterum quod superius, et tandem Tertium quod erat supremum; et ex illustratione inde percepi, quod super Primo Expanso essent Angeli, ex quibus primum seu ultimum Coelum; et super secundo Expanso essent Angeli, ex quibus secundum seu medium Coelum; et super tertio Expanso essent Angeli, ex quibus tertium seu supremum Coelum. Miratus sum primum quid et cur hoc; et mox audita est e Coelo vox sicut tubae, dicens, "percepimus, et nunc videmus, quod mediteris de Amore Conjugiali; et scimus, quod adhuc non aliquis in terris sciat, quid Amor vere Conjugialis in sua origine, et in sua essentia est, <sup>1</sup>et tamen interest ut sciatur; quare placuit Domino aperire tibi Coelos, ut in mentis tuae interiora influat lux illustrans, et inde perceptio: apud nos in Coelis, imprimis in Tertio, sunt Coelestes nostrae delitiae principaliter ex Amore Conjugiali; quare ex data nobis venia demittemus ad te Par conjugum ut videas:"</p><p>[2] et ecce tunc apparuit Currus e supremo seu tertio Coelo descendens, in quo visus est unus Angelus; sed sicut appropinquavit, visi sunt in illo duo: Currus e longinquo fulsit coram oculis meis sicut adamas, et ei alligati erant pulli equorum candidi sicut nix; et sedentes in Curru tenebant manibus duos turtures, et clamabant ad me, "vis ut propius adveniamus; sed cave tunc, ne coruscum, quod e Coelo nostro, e quo descendimus, et est flammeum, penetret interius, e cujus influxu quidem illustrantur ideae intellectus tui superiores, quae in se sunt coelestes, at hae in Mundo, in quo es, sunt ineffabiles; quare recipe, quae auditurus es, rationaliter, et sic ad intellectum expone illa;" et respondi, "cavebo, venite propius;" et venerunt, et ecce erat Maritus et ejus Uxor; et dixerunt, "sumus Conjuges; viximus beati in Coelo a Primo aevo, quod a vobis vocatur Saeculum Aureum, et perpetuo in simili flore aetatis, in quo tu nos vides hodie."</p><p>[3] Lustravi utrumque, quia percepi quod repraesentarent Amorem Conjugialem in sua vita et in suo ornatu; in sua vita in faciebus, et in suo ornatu in vestibus; omnes enim Angeli sunt affectiones amoris in forma humana; ipsa affectio regnans elucet ex illorum faciebus, et ex affectione et secundum illam sortiuntur vestes; quare dicitur in Coelo, quod sua Affectio quemlibet investiat. Maritus apparuit in aetate media inter adolescentiam et juventutem; ab oculis ejus emicabat lux scintillans ex sapientia amoris, ex qua luce facies ejus intime sicut radiabat, et ex eradiatione inde cutis in extremis quasi fulgebat; inde tota ejus facies fuit unus splendens decor: indutus erat talari, et sub talari veste coloris hyacinthini, et hanc circumligabat zona aurea, super qua erant tres lapides pretiosi, bini sapphiri a lateribus, ac pyropus in medio; tibialia ex splendente lino, cui intexta erant fila ex argento; et calcei ex holoserico: haec fuit Forma repraesentativa Amoris Conjugialis apud Maritum.</p><p>[4] Apud Uxorem autem fuit haec; facies ejus mihi visa est, et non visa; visa est ut ipsa pulchritudo, et non visa quia haec inexpressibilis; in facie enim erat splendor lucis flammeae, qualis lux est Angelis in Tertio Coelo, et haec visum meum hebetavit; quare modo obstupui: hoc illa animadvertens loquebatur ad me dicens, "quid vides;" respondi, "non video nisi Amorem Conjugialem, et ejus formam, sed video et non video;" ad haec avertit illa se oblique a marito, et tunc potui lustrare intentius; oculi ejus micabant ex luce Coeli sui, quae, ut dictum est, est flammea, et inde trahit ex amore sapientiae; amant enim Uxores in illo Coelo Maritos ex sapientia et in sapientia illorum, et Mariti uxores ex illo amore et in illo erga se, et sic uniuntur; inde erat pulchritudo ejus, quae talis, ut illam aemulari et sistere in sua forma non possit ullus pictor, non enim datur tale coruscum in ejus colore, nec tale formosum expressibile in ejus arte: crines erant in ordine decore positi secundum correspondentiam cum pulchritudine, et eis inserti flores ex diadematibus: collarium ei erat ex pyropis, ac inde pendebat rosarium ex chrysolithis; et ei armillae erant ex unionibus: amicta erat toga coccinea, et sub illa veste pectorali purpurea, quam anterius colligabant rubini: sed quod miratus sum, variegabantur colores secundum aspectum ad maritum, et quoque secundum illum nunc magis nunc minus coruscabant; in aspectu mutuo magis, et in aspectu obliquo minus.</p><p>[5] His visis loquebantur iterum mecum; et cum Maritus loquebatur ille simul sicut ex uxore, et cum Uxor simul illa sicut ex marito, erat enim talis unio mentium, ex quibus fluunt loquelae; et tunc etiam audivi sonum Amoris Conjugialis, quod intus esset simultaneus, et quoque procedens ex delitiis status pacis et innocentiae. Tandem dicebant, "revocamur, abibimus;" et tunc iterum apparuerunt vecti in curru, sicut prius; et vecti sunt per viam stratam inter floreta, e quorum areis exsurgebant oleae, et arbores plenae pomis aurantiis: et cum prope suum Coelum erant, obviam venerunt virgines, et recipiebant illos, et introducebant. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: essentiaest, </p>
