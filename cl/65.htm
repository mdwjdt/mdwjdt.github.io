<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第65节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>65、⑸这爱也是一切属天、属灵之爱，及由此而来的一切属世之爱的根基。就其本质而言，婚姻之爱之所以是天堂和教会的一切爱之根基，是因为它的源头是良善与真理的婚姻；构成人里面天堂和教会的一切爱皆由该婚姻产生。该婚姻的良善构成爱，其真理则构成智慧。当爱靠近智慧，或与智慧结合时，它就变成真爱；当智慧反过来靠近爱，并与其结合爱时，它就变成了真智慧。真正的婚姻之爱无非是爱与智慧的结合。这爱在夫妻二人之间，或在他们里面共享，而夫妻就是这爱的样式和可见形式。事实上，凡在天上者，都是爱的化身，在那里，面容是一个人爱之情感的真实形像；因为它就在天使里面，无论其整体还是每一部位，如前所述（37节）。由于夫妻在样式和形式上就是婚姻之爱，故可知，从这爱本身的形式所产生的一切爱都是它的复制品。所以，若婚姻之爱是属天、属灵的，那么它所产生的爱也是属天、属灵的。因此，婚姻之爱就像父母，而其它爱则像它的孩子。正因如此，天上天使的婚姻生育属灵的后代，也就是爱与智慧或良善与真理所繁衍的后代（对此，请参看51节）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>65、它是一切天国的，灵性的及自然的爱的基础。从本质上讲，婚姻之爱是天国中和教会中的有的爱的基础，因为它来自于善与真理的结合。善与真理的结合中产生了形成一个人及一个教会的所有其它的爱。在这种结合中的善产生出爱，其中的真理中产生了智慧。当爱被附加在真理上或当爱与真理相结合时，爱才会变得可爱。当智慧被附加到爱并且与爱相结合时，智慧才可称为是智慧的。</p><p>真正的婚姻之爱就是爱与智慧的统一。同时拥有这种爱的夫妻双方就是爱和智慧的反应和体现。在天国中也是这样，面容上真实反应他们的情感。这种爱普遍存在。</p><p>因为夫妻双方是真正婚姻之爱形式的展现，所以这一形式而来的一切其它的爱都反应着这种婚姻之爱。因而，如果婚姻之爱是天国般的，有灵性的，由此而来的其它的爱也是天国般的，有灵性的。</p><p>因而，婚姻之爱就像是父母亲一样，其它的爱是这种爱的繁衍。这就是天国中天使们婚姻而产生的后裔是有灵性的，是爱和智慧，或者说是善和真理。（见第51而）</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #65 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>65. (v) This love is also the foundation of all celestial and spiritual loves, and thus of all natural ones.<p>The reason why conjugial love, regarded in its essence, is the foundation of all the loves of heaven and the church is that its source is the marriage of good and truth; and from this marriage arise all the loves which make heaven and the church present with a person. The good of this marriage makes love, and its truth makes wisdom. When love approaches wisdom or joins itself to it, it becomes real love; and when wisdom in turn approaches love and joins itself to it, it becomes real wisdom. Truly conjugial love is nothing else but the linking of love and wisdom.<p>A married couple between whom or in whom that love is together shared are models and a visible form of it. Indeed, all in the heavens, where faces are true images of the affections of one's love, are likenesses of it; for it is in them both generally and in every part of them, as shown before. Now since a married couple are that love in model and form, it follows that every love which arises from the form of love itself is a copy of it. So if conjugial love is celestial and spiritual, so are the loves arising from it. Thus conjugial love is like a parent, and the other loves are like its children. This is how it is that the marriages of angels in the heavens lead to the birth of spiritual offspring, things to do with love and wisdom, or good and truth; on this, see <a href="51.htm">51</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #65 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>65. 5. It is also the fundamental love of all celestial, spiritual, and consequently natural loves. Regarded in its essence, conjugial love is the fundamental love of all loves in heaven and the church, because it originates from the marriage between good and truth, and from this marriage spring all the loves which form heaven and the church in a person. The good in this marriage produces love, and the truth in it produces wisdom. And when love is added to wisdom or united with it, then love becomes loving. And when wisdom conversely is added to love and united with it, then wisdom becomes wise.<p>Truly conjugial love is nothing but a union of love and wisdom. Two married partners who have this love between them and in them at the same time are a reflection and image of it. In the heavens, too, where the looks of their faces are genuine representations of the affections of their love, they are all likenesses of it, for it is in them in general and in every part, as we showed previously.<p>Now because two partners are a form of this love in image and effigy, it follows that every other love that springs from the form this love takes is a reflection of it. Consequently, if conjugial love is celestial and spiritual, the loves springing from it are also celestial and spiritual.<p>Conjugial love, therefore, is like a parent, and the rest of the loves are like offspring. That is why the offspring born of the marriages of angels in heaven are spiritual offspring, which are procreations of love and wisdom, or of goodness and truth. (Regarding this procreation, see above, no. <a href="51.htm">51</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #65 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>65. 5. It is also the basic love of all heavenly, spiritual and, therefore, earthly loves. In view of its essence, the love in marriage is the basic love of all loves in heaven and the church because its source is the marriage of good and truth, and all the loves that make a heaven and a church for people come from this marriage. The good in this marriage creates love, and its truth creates wisdom, and when love accepts wisdom, or joins with it, then love becomes love. When wisdom accepts love in return, or joins in with it, then wisdom becomes wisdom.<p>The real love in marriage is nothing other than love and wisdom uniting. Two partners who both at once have this love between them, or in them, are likenesses and patterns of it. And in heaven, where faces are genuine expressions of one's love, the people all resemble it. For it is in them everywhere and in each part, as I showed already. Now, because two partners are this love in likeness and pattern, it follows that every love that comes from the pattern of this love is a likeness of it. So if married love is heavenly and spiritual, so are the loves that come from it. The love in marriage itself is like a parent, and the other loves are like children. This is why marriages of angels in heaven produce spiritual offspring - which are loves and wisdoms, or goods and truths.<p>(See no. <a href="51.htm">51</a>, above, about this procreation.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #65 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>65. V. THAT IT IS ALSO THE FUNDAMENTAL LOVE OF ALL CELESTIAL AND SPIRITUAL LOVES, AND THENCE OF ALL NATURAL LOVES. The reason why conjugial love, regarded in its essence, is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven and the Church, is because its origin is from the marriage of good and truth, and from this marriage proceed all the loves which make heaven and the Church with man. The good of this marriage makes the love, and the truth thereof makes the wisdom; and when love approaches wisdom and conjoins itself therewith, then love becomes love; and when wisdom in turn approaches love and conjoins itself therewith, then wisdom becomes wisdom. Love truly conjugial is nothing else than the conjunction of love and wisdom. Two married partners, between whom is this love, that is, who are in it simultaneously, are an effigy and form of the love; and in the heavens, where faces are genuine types of the affections of their love, all angels are likenesses of it, for, as already shown [no. <a href="37.htm">37</a>], it is within them in their whole being and in every part thereof. Now since two married partners are this love in effigy and form, it follows that every love which proceeds from the very form of love is a likeness thereof. Therefore, if conjugial love is celestial and spiritual, the loves proceeding from it are also celestial and spiritual. Conjugial love, therefore, is like a parent, and all other loves like his offspring. Hence it is, that from the marriages of angels in the heavens are generated spiritual offspring which are the offspring of love and wisdom or good and truth. Concerning this generation, see no. <a href="51.htm">51</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #65 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>65. (v) It is also the fundamental love among all celestial and spiritual loves and among natural loves thence. Marital love, regarded in its essence, is the basic love in all the loves of heaven and the Church, because it has its origin in the marriage of good and truth; from that marriage proceed all loves constituting heaven and the Church with the human being. The good of that marriage gives love, and the truth gives wisdom. When love approaches wisdom or unites with it, then love becomes love; when wisdom in turn approaches love and unites with it, then wisdom becomes wisdom. True marital love is nothing but the conjunction of love and wisdom. Two partners, in and between whom that love exists, are an effigy and form of it. In the heavens, moreover, where faces are the actual types of the affections of one's love, all are semblances of it, for one's love wholly pervades one, as was shown above. As two partners are marital love in effigy and form, all love proceeding from such a form must have a like character. If the marital love is celestial and spiritual, the loves which proceed from it are celestial and spiritual. Marital love is therefore like a parent, and other loves like a progeny. Hence a spiritual progeny, which is one of love and wisdom, or of good and truth, is generated from the marriages of the angels in the heavens (see above,<a href="51.htm">51</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #65 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>65. (5) It is also the fundamental love of all loves, celestial, spiritual, and thence of all natural loves. The reason why conjugial love considered in its essence is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven and the church is, that its origin is from the marriage of good and truth, and from that marriage all the loves which make heaven and the church with man proceed. The good of that marriage constitutes the love, and the truth of it constitutes the wisdom; and when love approaches wisdom, or conjoins itself with it, it then becomes love indeed; and when in turn wisdom approaches love, or conjoins itself, with it, it becomes wisdom indeed. Love truly conjugial is nothing else than the conjunction of love and wisdom. Two married partners, between whom or in whom at the same time this love exists, are an effigy and form of it; and in all the heavens, where the faces are genuine types of the affections of their love all are likenesses of it; for it is in them in general and in every individual part, as has been shown before. Now, since two married partners are this love in effigy and in form, it follows that every love that proceeds from the form of the love itself is a resemblance of it. If therefore, conjugial love is celestial and spiritual the loves proceeding from it are also celestial and spiritual. Conjugial love then is as the parent and the other loves are as the offspring. Hence it is that from the marriages of the angels in the heavens spiritual offspring are generated, which are generations of love and wisdom, or of good and truth, of which generation see above, n. <a href="51.htm">51</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #65 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>65. V: Quod etiam sit Amor fundamentalis omnium amorum coelestium, spiritualium, et inde naturalium. Quod Amor conjugialis in sua essentia spectatus sit Amor fundamentalis omnium amorum Coeli et Ecclesiae, est quia origo ejus est ex Conjugio boni et veri, et ex hoc Conjugio procedunt omnes amores, qui faciunt Coelum et Ecclesiam apud hominem; bonum illius conjugii facit amorem, ac verum ejus facit sapientiam, et quando amor ad sapientiam accedit, seu cum hac se conjungit, tunc amor fit amor, et cum sapientia vicissim ad amorem accedit, et cum hac se conjungit, tunc sapientia fit sapientia. Amor vere conjugialis non aliud est quam conjunctio amoris et sapientiae; duo Conjuges, inter quos seu in quibus simul est ille amor, sunt effigies et forma illius; omnes etiam in Coelis, ubi facies sunt genuini typi affectionum sui amoris, sunt similitudines ejus, inest enim illis in communi et in omni parte, ut prius ostensum est; nunc quia duo Conjuges in effigie et forma sunt ille Amor, sequitur quod omnis amor qui procedit ex ipsius amoris forma, sit instar ejus; quare si Amor conjugialis est coelestis et spiritualis, etiam amores procedentes ex illo sunt coelestes et spirituales; est itaque Amor conjugialis sicut parens, et reliqui amores sunt sicut proles; inde est, quod ex Conjugiis Angelorum in Coelis generentur proles spirituales, quae sunt amoris et sapientiae, seu boni et veri, de qua generatione videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_65/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_51" target=_top>51</a> </p>
