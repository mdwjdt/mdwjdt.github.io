<h4 align="center"></h4><p>205、我从天使那里听说，生活在上古时代的人如今仍按家庭、宗族、民族排列的形式住在天上，和他们在世时一样，各家各户几乎没有缺失任何成员。他们说，这是因为他们享有真正的婚姻之爱。他们的孩子由此继承了朝向良善与真理的婚姻之倾向，并在父母的教养下，轻而易举地被父母越来越深地引入该婚姻；后来等到了能凭自己的判断行事的年龄，他们就被主貌似凭自己引入该婚姻。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>205、我从天使那得知生活在远古的人现如今仍然是以一家一家的形式生活在天国中。仍然有国度，就与在世间时一样，每一家几乎都不缺少任何成员，因为他们曾拥有真正的婚姻之爱。他们的子女也从他们那继承了善与真理相结合的倾向，并且在父母的教导下更深刻地接受这点，后来在主的带领下会做出自己的判断。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #205 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>205. I have been told by angels that those who lived in the most ancient times live today in the heavens, arranged by households, by families and by tribes, in much the same way as they had lived on earth, with hardly any missing from their households. This, they said, is because they enjoyed truly conjugial love. From this their children inherited the inclination towards the principle of the marriage of good and truth; and they were through their upbringing easily started towards accepting it more and more inwardly by their parents, and then as if by themselves; and when they became able to use their own judgment, they were introduced into it by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #205 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>205. I have heard from angels that people who used to live in very ancient times, today in heaven continue to live household by household, family by family, and nation by nation, similarly to the way they had lived on earth, and that scarcely anyone is missing from any household. The reason, they said, is that truly conjugial love existed among them; and their children consequently inherited inclinations toward the conjugial connection between good and truth, into which they were easily introduced more and more deeply by their parents through their upbringing and education, and into which they were afterwards led by the Lord as though on their own when they came into their own right and judgment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #205 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>205. I have heard from angels that the people who lived in the earliest ages live today in heaven, house by house, family by family, and nation by nation the same as they lived on earth. And hardly anyone from a household is missing. The reason is that they had real married love. Therefore their children inherited inclinations toward the marriage of good and truth, and their parents easily introduced them more and more deeply into this marriage by education. And afterwards, when they developed judgment, the Lord introduced them to it as if on their own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #205 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>205. I have heard from angels, that those who lived in most ancient times are at this day living in heaven, house by house, family by family, nation by nation, in like manner as they had lived on earth, with scarcely any one missing from a household; and, furthermore, that the reason is because with them was love truly conjugial. As a consequence, their offspring inherited inclinations to the conjugial of good and truth, and through education by their parents, were easily initiated into it more and more interiorly, and later, when they came to act of their own judgment, were introduced into it by the Lord as of themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #205 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>205. I have heard from the angels that the people who lived in the most ancient times live today in the heavens in houses and families and tribes as they did on earth, and that scarcely ever is a member missing from any household. They gave as the reason that there had been true marital love among them, and that offspring inherited thence inclinations to the marital tendency of good and truth and were readily initiated into it more and more deeply by parents through education, and finally were introduced into it by the Lord as of themselves on acquiring judgment of their own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #205 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>205. I have heard from the angels that those who lived in the most ancient times are to this day living in heaven, houses and houses, families and families, nations and nations, in like manner as they lived on earth, and that scarcely anyone from a house is wanting; and that the reason is, because there was love truly conjugial with them, and their offspring thence inherited from them inclinations to the conjugial of good and truth, and were easily initiated into it by their parents, through education, more and more interiorly, and afterwards as of themselves by the Lord, when they came to act of their own judgment. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #205 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>205. Audivi ab Angelis, quod illi, qui in Antiquissimis aevis vixerant, hodie in Coelis vivant domus et domus, familiae et familiae, ac gentes et gentes, similiter ut vixerant in terris, et quod vix aliquis a domo desit; et quod causa sit, quia apud illos fuit Amor vere conjugialis; et quod inde proles haereditaverint inclinationes ad Conjugiale boni et veri, ac quod interius et interius in illud a parentibus per educationes facile initiati sint, et dein sicut a semetipsis, cum sui judicii facti sunt, a Domino introducti sint. </p>
