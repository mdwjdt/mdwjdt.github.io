<h4 align="center"></h4><p>365、⑸善爱的热情将爱和友谊藏在里头，但恶爱的热情将仇恨和报复藏在里头。我说过，热情表面上看似生气和愤怒，无论在那些处于善爱的人当中还是在那些陷入恶爱的人当中。但由于内在不同，所以生气和愤怒也不同，并且同样分为两种。不同之处在于：<br><br>①善爱的热情就像天堂的火焰，从不喷向别人，除非自卫；它对恶人的防御，就好像这恶人冲进火里被烧焦了一样。而恶爱的热情则像地狱的火焰，从自己喷发出来，扑到别人身上，意欲烧毁他。<br><br>②一旦对方停止攻击，善爱的热情立刻熄灭，变得温和。而恶爱的热情会持续燃烧，不会熄灭。<br><br>③原因是，热爱良善之人的内在本身是温和、轻柔、友善和仁慈的。所以，当他的外在为了自卫而变得粗鲁、炸毛、竖立，因而行为严厉时，它仍能被内在所体验的良善缓和下来。恶人则不然；他们的内在是不友好、凶狠、冷酷，呼吸的是仇恨和报复，吃的则是它们所给予的快感。即便他们和解，这些情绪仍然潜伏着，就像灰烬中的余火；这些余火即便在这个世界没有爆发出来，死后也会爆发。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>365、（5）在善的爱的热情这中是友谊和爱，在恶的爱的热情之中是恨和敌意。我们说热情在外在上表现为气恼和愤怒。是因为其内在因素是不同的，所以他们表现气恼和愤怒的方式也是不同的，不同之处如下：</p><p>1、善的爱的热情就象天堂之火，它从不会跳出去攻击别人，而只是会保护自己。而对恶的爱的热情则象地狱之火，它会冲出去尽力伤害他人。</p><p>2、对善的爱的热情在对方停止攻击后会马上变弱并消失，而对恶的爱的热情却不会熄灭。</p><p>3、原因是有对善的爱的热情的人的内在因素是温和，友好的。即使在保护自己时会强硬起来，它也是被其内在的善所驱动的。而恶人却非如此，他们的内在因素是坚硬的，充满仇恨。即使它处于静止状态，以上情绪也是处于潜伏状态，即使烈火在人在世时不爆发出来，在死后也会爆发出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #365 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>365. (v) The zeal of a good love conceals within it love and friendship, but the zeal of an evil love conceals within it hatred and revenge.<p>I said that zeal outwardly looks like anger and exasperation, both with those whose love is good and those whose love is evil. But since the inner levels are different, there are two kinds of anger and exasperation. These are as follows:<p>1. The zeal of a good love is like a heavenly flame, which never lashes out against another, but only defends itself. Its defence against a wicked person is as if he rushes into the fire and gets burnt up. But the zeal of an evil love is like a hellish flame, which lashes out from itself and rushes at another, wishing to burn him up.<p>2. The zeal of a good love at once burns down and weakens, when the other leaves off attacking; but the zeal of an evil love lasts and is not quenched.<p>3. The reason is that the inner region of one who loves good is in itself mild, gentle, friendly and benevolent. So when the outer region to defend itself becomes rough, bristles, is aroused and acts severely, it is still tempered by the good experienced by the inner region. It is different with the wicked; their inner region is unfriendly, violent and harsh, breathing hatred and revenge, feeding on the pleasures they give. Even if they become reconciled, these emotions are still lurking, like fire in wooden logs under the ashes. Though these fires may not break out in the world, they do so after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #365 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>365. 5. The zeal of a good love harbors in its inner aspects friendship and love, but the zeal of an evil love harbors in its inner aspects hatred and vengeance. We said that zeal appears in outward respects like anger and rage, both in those who are prompted by a good love and in those who are prompted by an evil love. But because the internal elements are different, so also their expressions of anger and rage are different; and the differences are as follows:<p>1. The zeal of a good love is like a heavenly flame, which never leaps out to attack another, but only defends itself - defending itself against an evil assailant in much the same way as when such a one rushes at fire and is burned; whereas the zeal of an evil love is like a hellish flame, which spontaneously leaps out and rushes upon another and tries to devour him.<p>2. The zeal of a good love immediately dies down and softens when the other desists from the attack; whereas the zeal of an evil love persists and is not extinguished.<p>3. The reason for this is that the internal element in one who is prompted by a love of good, is, in itself, gentle, mild, friendly and kind. Consequently, even when, to protect itself, the external element hardens, stiffens, bristles, and so acts harshly, still it is tempered by the goodness which moves its internal element. Not so in evil people. In them the internal element is hostile, savage, harsh, seething with hatred and vengeance, and it feeds on the delights of those emotions. And even if it is appeased, still those emotions lie concealed within, like fires smoldering in the wood beneath the ash; and if these fires do not break out in the world, nevertheless they do after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #365 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>365. 5. The zeal of a good love harbors love and friendship within it, but the zeal of a bad love harbors hate and revenge within it. We said that outwardly zeal seems like wrath and an outbreak of anger, in people with a good love as well as in people with a bad love. But what is inside is different, and the wrath and outbreaks of anger differ inwardly. The differences are: (a) The zeal of a good love is like a heavenly flame that never breaks out against someone else but only defends itself. It defends itself against an evil, as if the evil rushes into a fire and is burned up. But the zeal of a bad love is like the fire of hell, which breaks out of itself and attacks and wants to burn someone else up. (b) The zeal of a good love instantly subsides and mellows when the other one withdraws from his attack, but the zeal of a bad love lasts and does not go out. (c) The reason is that what is inside a person who loves good is in itself mild, gentle, friendly, and kind, so when he becomes violent outwardly, waves his fists, bristles, and acts roughly like this by way of defense, it is still tempered by the goodness of his inward makeup. It is different with bad people. What is inside them is unfriendly, fierce, hard, breathes hate and revenge, and nurses itself on the joy of these qualities. And they still lie hidden like fire in logs under the ashes, even when the trouble has been settled. If these fires do not break out in the world, they do after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #365 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>365. V. THAT INWARDLY IN THE ZEAL OF A GOOD LOVE LIE LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP, BUT INWARDLY IN THE ZEAL OF AN EVIL LOVE LIE HATRED AND REVENGE. It was said that in outer manifestation zeal appears as anger and wrath, both with those who are in a good love and with those who are in an evil; but because the internals differ, the anger and wrath also differ. The differences are: I. The zeal of a good love is as a heavenly flame which never bursts out against another but only defends itself; and its defense against an evil man is as a defense while the latter is rushing into the fire and being burned. But the zeal of an evil love is like an infernal flame which bursts out of itself and rushes upon another and wills to consume him. 2. The zeal of a good love instantly dies down and becomes mild when the assailant withdraws from the attack; but the zeal of an evil love persists and is not extinguished. 3. The reason is because the internal of him who is in the love of good is in itself mild, bland, friendly, and benevolent. Therefore, while, for the purpose of defending itself, his external is rough, bristles up, and erects itself and so acts with severity, yet it is tempered by means of the good in which is his internal. Not so with the evil. With them the internal is inimical, fierce, hard, breathing hatred and revenge, and it feeds itself on the delights of these passions. Even when there is reconciliation these passions are still latent, like fire in the embers beneath the ashes; and these fires break out, if not in this world yet after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #365 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>365. (v) The zeal of a good love hides love and friendship in its internals, but the zeal of an evil love hides hatred and revenge in its internals. We have said that zeal in externals looks like anger and wrath with those in a good love as well as with those in an evil love. But as the internals are different, the anger and wrath are, too. The differences are as follows: 1. The zeal of good love is like a heavenly flame which never bursts forth against another, but only defends itself, doing no more than this against an evil person; it is the latter who rushes into the fire and is consumed. But the zeal of evil love is like an infernal flame; it bursts forth and rushes out and wants to consume the other. 2. The zeal of a good love at once dies down and softens when the other retreats from the attack; but the zeal of an evil love persists and is not extinguished. 3. For the internal of a person in a good love is in itself mild, bland, friendly and benevolent. Therefore the external, though it grows rough, bristles, draws itself up, and thus deals severely to defend itself, is still tempered by the good in which its internal is. The case is otherwise with the evil. With them the internal is unfriendly, fierce, hard, breathing hatred and revenge, finding food in harboring these feelings. Even when there is reconciliation, these feelings hide like a fire under ashes. These fires break out after death if not in this world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #365 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>365. (5) That the zeal of good love, in its internals, conceals love and friendship; but that the zeal of evil love in its internals conceals hatred and vindictiveness. It was said that in externals zeal appears as anger and wrath, both with those who are in good love and with those who are in evil love. But as internals differ, their anger and wrath also are different; and are as follows. (1) The zeal of good love is as a heavenly flame which never breaks forth upon another, but only defends itself, and it defends itself against evil, as when one rushes into the fire and is burned up; but the zeal of an evil love is as an infernal flame which bursts forth out of itself and attacks, and would consume the other. (2) The zeal of good love instantly burns away and grows gentle, when the other withdraws from the attack; but the zeal of an evil love persists, and is not extinguished. (3) The reason is that the internal of him who is in the love of good in itself is mild, gentle, friendly, and benevolent; and therefore, while the external for the purpose of defending itself becomes rough, harsh, erect, and so acts with severity, yet it is tempered from the good in which its internal is. With the evil it is otherwise. With them the internal is hostile, fierce, hard, breathing hatred and vindictiveness, and nurtures itself from their delights. And though reconciled these still lie hidden, like fire in wood beneath the ashes. And these fires break forth, if not in this world, yet after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #365 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>365. V. Quod Zelus amoris boni in internis suis recondat amorem et amicitiam, at quod Zelus amoris mali in internis suis recondat odium et vindictam. Dictum est, quod Zelus in externis appareat sicut ira et excandescentia, tam apud illos qui in amore bono sunt, quam apud illos qui in amore malo; sed quia Interna sunt alia, etiam irae et excandescentiae illae sunt aliae; et sunt, ut sequitur, 1. Zelus amoris boni est sicut flamma coelestis, quae nusquam erumpit in alterum, sed modo se defendit, ac se defendit contra malum, sicut dum hic irruit in ignem, et comburitur: at Zelus amoris mali, est sicut flamma infernalis, quae ex se erumpit ac irruit, et vult alterum consumere. 2. Zelus amoris boni illico deflagrat et mitescit, dum alter ab impugnatione recedit; at Zelus amoris mali perdurat, et non exstinguitur. <sup>1</sup>3. Causa est, quia Internum ejus, qui in amore boni est, in se est mite, blandum, amicum, et benevolum, quare dum Externum se tutandi gratia asperat, crispat, erigit, et sic dure agit, usque ex bono, in quo est Internum ejus, temperatum est; aliter apud malos; apud hos Internum est inimicum, immite, durum, spirans odium et vindictam, et lactat se ex jucundis illorum; et tametsi reconciliatur, usque latent illa sicut ignes in lignis sub cinere; et hi ignes, si non in Mundo, usque post obitum erumpunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: exstinguitur (absque puncto) </p>
