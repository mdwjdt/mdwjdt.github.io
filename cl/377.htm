<h4 align="center"></h4><p>377、⑿由情妇所引发的嫉妒也是有的，但在性质上不同于由妻子所引发的。对男人来说，由妻子所引发的嫉妒源于最内层，由情妇所引发的嫉妒仅源于最外层，所以它们在性质上是不同的。由妻子所引发的嫉妒之所以源于最内层，是因为婚姻之爱居于最内层。这爱之所以居于最内层，是因为婚姻通过永恒的契约，以及双方对彼此所享有的平等权利而被牢固建立起来，故能将他们的灵魂联结起来，并在他们的心智之间形成更高的纽带。这种纽带和联结一旦建立，就牢不可破，无论后来他们之间的爱变得温暖还是冷淡。<br><br>正因如此，若妻子主动要求做爱，丈夫整个人会从最内层到最外层完全冻结。反之，若情妇这样做，情夫则不会有这种感觉。由妻子所引发的嫉妒还伴随着寻求好名声，以得到尊重的问题；而由情妇所引发的嫉妒则没有这种顾虑。然而，这两种嫉妒各不相同，既取决于从妻子或情妇那里所接受的爱所居之地，同时还取决于接受它的男人判断力的状态。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #377 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>377. (xii) There is also jealousy inspired by mistresses, but this is different in nature from that inspired by wives.<p>Jealousy of wives wells up from the inmost levels of the personality, but jealousy of mistresses only from the outward levels, so this is different in character. The reason jealousy of wives wells up from the inmost levels us that this is where conjugial love dwells. This is because a marriage, by reason of its being firmly established by a compact to last for ever, and also of the equal rights which one has over the other, unites their souls and forms a higher bond between their minds. Once this bond and union have been established, they remain indissoluble, however warm or cold the love between them becomes.</p><p>[2] This is why an invitation to make love coming from the wife would totally freeze the husband from inmost to outermost. But such an invitation from a mistress to a lover would not do so. Jealousy regarding a wife is accompanied by seeking for good repute so as to be respected; and this accompaniment of jealousy is lacking where a mistress is concerned. But both of these types of jealousy are varied, depending on where the love coming from a wife or from a mistress is received, and also upon the state of the man's judgment who receives it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #377 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>377. 12. One finds a jealousness also in regard to mistresses, but not such as arises in regard to wives. Jealousness in regard to wives springs from the inmost elements in a person, whereas jealousness in regard to mistresses springs from the outmost elements, so that they are different in character.<p>Jealousness in regard to wives springs from the inmost elements, because that is where conjugial love has its seat. It has its seat there, because by its sworn eternity established by covenant, and also by the equality of right by which what belongs to one belongs to the other, marriage unites souls and binds the deeper levels of their minds. Once implanted, this union and bond remains unsundered, whatever love exists between them later, be it warm or cold.</p><p>[2] (That is why an overture to lovemaking on the part of a wife chills a man totally from inmosts to outmosts, whereas an overture to lovemaking on the part of a mistress does not so chill a lover.)<p>Jealousness in regard to a wife has attached to it the wish for a good name, to preserve one's honor; and this subsidiary reason for jealousness does not exist in regard to a mistress.<p>Still, however, these two kinds of jealousness each vary, depending on the seat of the love received from the wife or of that received from the mistress, and depending at the same time on the state of the judgment of the man receiving it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #377 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>377. 12. There is also jealousy for mistresses, but it is not the same kind as for wives. Jealousy for wives wells up from the deepest parts of people, but jealousy for mistresses springs from outer things, so these are jealousies of different kinds. Jealousy for wives wells from the deepest parts because that is where the love in marriage resides. It resides there because marriage unites souls and joins minds very deeply, because of its permanent contract settled by the covenant and also by the equal justice that one belongs to the other. Once imposed, this joining and union remains unbreakable, whatever kind of love, warm or cold, comes in later. This is why an incitement to love from a wife chills the whole man, inside and out, but incitement to love from a mistress does not chill a lover Jealousy () 369 this way. A desire for a reputation of honor attaches to jealousy for a wife, and there is not this ingredient in jealousy for a mistress.<p>But still, both these kinds of jealousy vary according to where the love resides that a wife receives, and that a mistress does, and also according to the discernment of the man receiving it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #377 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>377. XII. THAT THERE IS JEALOUSY ALSO FOR MISTRESSES, BUT IT IS NOT OF THE SAME NATURE AS FOR WIVES. With man, jealousy for wives springs from inmosts, but jealousy for mistresses from outmosts. Therefore they differ in kind. That jealousy for wives springs from inmosts is because in inmosts resides conjugial love; and it resides there because, by reason of its eternal pact established by covenant, and also by reason of equality of right, in that what belongs to the one partner belongs to the other, marriage unites souls and binds minds together more deeply. This binding and union, once imposed, remains unbroken, whatsoever be the later love between them, whether warm or cold.</p><p>[2] Thence it is, that invitation to love by a wife chills the whole man from inmosts to ultimates, while invitation to love by a mistress does not thus chill the lover. To jealousy for a wife is added ambition for a good name for the sake of honor, while jealousy for a mistress lacks this accessory. Yet both these jealousies vary according to the seat of the love received from the wife, and of that received from the mistress, and at the same time, according to the state of the judgment of the man receiving it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #377 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>377. (xii) There is jealousy over mistresses, too, but not such as there is for wives. Jealousy for one's wife comes from the inmosts with a man, but jealousy over a mistress from the externals, and hence they are different in kind. Jealousy for wives issues from the inmosts for the reason that marital love resides in the inmosts. It resides there because marriage, from the eternity bespoken for it and secured by covenant, and also through equality of right (by which what belongs to one belongs to the other), unites the souls, and deeply binds the minds. Once effected, the mental bond and the union of souls remain undisrupted whatever the love, warm or cold, which ensues. Hence invitation to love from the wife chills the whole man from inmosts to outmosts; but invitation to love from a mistress does not so affect her lover. Desire for a good and honorable name also attaches to jealousy for a wife, but there is no such incentive to jealousy for a mistress. Still, in either case, jealousy varies, both according to the seat of the love received from wife or mistress, and according to the state of judgment of the man receiving it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #377 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>377. (12) That there is also jealousy for concubines, but not of such kind as for wives. Jealousy for wives flows down from the inmosts with man, but jealousy for mistresses flows from the externals, and therefore, they are of different kind. Jealousy for wives flows from the inmosts, because there conjugial love resides; and it resides there because marriage, by the promised eternity of it established by the covenant, and also by equality of right, in that what is one's is the others, unites the souls, and binds the minds together above. This tie and that union once effected remain unsevered, whatever be the love, hot or cold, that afterwards intervenes. Hence it is that invitation to love by a wife chills the whole man, from inmosts to outermosts; while invitation to love by a concubine does not thus chill a paramour. To jealousy for a wife is added ambition of a good name for the sake of honor; and there is not this accessory to jealousy for a mistress. But yet both these jealousies are various-according to the seat of the love received from the wife, and from the mistress; and at the same time according to the state of judgment of the man receiving it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #377 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>377. XII. Quod Zelotypia etiam sit pro pellicibus, sed non talis qualis est pro uxoribus. Zelotypia pro uxoribus scaturit ex intimis apud hominem, at Zelotypia pro pellicibus ab externis, quare sunt alius generis: quod Zelotypia pro uxoribus ex intimis scaturiat, est causa, quia Amor conjugialis ibi residet; quod ibi resideat, est quia conjugium ex pacta aeternitate ejus constabilita per foedus, et quoque ex aequalitate juris quod unius sit alterius, unit animas, et mentes superius ligat: haec ligatio et illa unio semel indita, manet indivulsa, qualiscunque amor, sive calidus sive frigidus, postea intercedit.</p><p>[2] Inde est, quod invitatio ad amorem ab uxore infrigeret totum virum ab intimis ad ultima; at invitatio ad amorem a pellice, amasium non ita. Ad Zelotypiam pro uxore accedit ambitio famae propter honorem; et hoc accessorium Zelotypiae non est pro pellice. Sed usque haec et illa Zelotypia varia est secundum sedem amoris recepti ab uxore, et recepti a pellice, et simul secundum statum judicii viri recipientis illum. </p>
