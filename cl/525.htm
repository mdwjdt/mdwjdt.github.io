<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第525节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>525、⑵一个人的良善被复制给另一个人是不可能的。这也可从以下要点清楚看出来：<br><br>①每个人都生在邪恶中。<br><br>②他通过被主重生被引入良善。<br><br>③这一切通过照主的诫命生活实现。<br><br>④故如此被植入的良善无法被复制。<br><br>第一点：每个人都生在邪恶中，这在教会是众所周知的。有人说，这邪恶是从亚当那里遗传下来的。而事实上，它来自父母。每个人都从父母那里获得自己的意向，也就是他的倾向。理性和经验都支持这一点。因为父母的形像，无论脸面、秉性还是行为，都清楚可见于他们的子女、直系后代，以及经由他们的子女所生的更遥远的后代。许多人能据此认出各个家族，并判断出他们的秉性。因此，人与生俱来的邪恶就是父母所获得、进而传给他们后代的邪恶。人们之所以认为亚当的罪被铭刻在整个人类身上，是因为很少有人反思、因而认识他们所拥有的邪恶。因此，他们认为这恶隐藏如此之深，以至于除了在神面前外，是看不见的。<br><br>第二点：他通过被主重生被引入良善。重生的事实，以及人若不重生，就不能见神的国，从主在约翰福音（3:3，5）中的话清楚看出来。重生就是洁除邪恶，从而拥有一个更新的生命；这在基督教界并非秘密，因为当理性承认每个人都生在邪恶中，并且这邪恶无法像用肥皂和水洗去污垢那样被洗掉或清除，只有通过悔改才能被洁除时，也能看出这一点。<br><br>第三点：人通过照主的诫命生活而被主引入良善。有五条诫命对重生来说是必不可少的（参看82节），其中包括：要避开邪恶，因为它们属于魔鬼、来自魔鬼；要行出良善，因为它们属于神、来自神；要靠近主，祈求祂使他们去做这些事。要让每个人检查自己，认真思考人是否能从其它任何源头拥有良善；他若没有良善，就不能得救。<br><br>第四点：故如此被植入的良善无法被复制。复制意味着一个人的良善转给另一个人。综上所述，可知：就其灵而言，人通过重生而全然一新，这一切通过照主的诫命生活实现。谁都不难看出，这种更新只能不时地发生，极其类似于一棵树从种子逐步发出根来，然后生长并得以完全。那些对重生具有不同观念的人完全不知道人的状态，以及良善与邪恶全然对立，以致良善只能在邪恶被移除的程度内被植入。他们也没有意识到，只要人陷入邪恶，他就憎恶本身为良善的良善。因此，若一个人的良善真的被转入某个陷入邪恶的人，就好比将羔羊扔给恶狼，或将一串珍珠拴到猪鼻子上。由此可见，复制是不可能的。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>525、（2）将一个人的善转给另一个人是不可能的。这一点按以下顺序讲述。</p><p>1、每个人生来都处于一种罪恶境界中。</p><p>2、他被拯救而进入到善的境界中。</p><p>3、这是要通过人按主的要求生活而实现的。</p><p>4、所以，当善根植于人之中后，它不能被转给别人。</p><p>首先，每个人生来都处于一种罪恶境界中。教会中的人都知道这点。有说话认为罪恶来自于亚当，其实罪恶是来自于人的父母。每个人都从父母那里得到一种性质。后代会在面容上象父母，在性质和习惯上也如此。很多人能从人的气质上看出他是属于什么样的家庭，因此是父母身上的恶会传给后代。</p><p>人们会认为是亚当的罪恶影响到整个人类，并且它藏在深处，只有神才会知道。</p><p>第二，人被主拯救而进入到善的境界中</p><p>重生是可能的，否则人无法进入天国。约翰3:3，5节中很明显可以看到。在基督教界，不会不知道重生就是从罪恶中净化出来而获得新的生命。理性的人都会知道罪恶不会象尘土被水可以洗去，而是要通过悔过才能清除罪恶。</p><p>第三，这是要通过人按主的要求生活而实现的。在82节中五条对于重生非常重要。另外还包括以下：罪恶必须要避免，因为它是属于恶魔的；并且人要做善事因为善是来自于神的。人要跟随神并在神的带领下做到这些。若人不能获得善，他也就不会得到拯救。</p><p>第四，当善根植于人之中后，它不会被转给别人。</p><p>从上述可以看到，通过重生，一个人在其精神上完全更新了。这是通过人按主的要求生活而实现的。有谁不会看到，这是要经过时间逐渐完成的？就象是树木从种子到生根再长成一样。</p><p>对重生不这样看的人并不了解人的状态，也不了解善和恶，以及善和恶是完全相反的。善除非在恶被排除后才会存在。他们也不知道只要人处于罪恶之中，他就会抵制任何的善，因此，若一个人的善若被转给一个恶人，就象是将小羊抛给狼。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #525 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>525. (ii) It is impossible for one person's good to be copied into another.<p>This too can be clearly seen from the following list of points. (a) Every person is born in a state of evil. (b) He is brought into a state of good through being regenerated by the Lord. (c) This takes place through living in accordance with His commandments. (d) Therefore good, being so implanted, cannot be copied.<p>First, it is well known in the church that every person is born in a state of evil. This evil is said to be inherited from Adam, but it actually comes from the parents. Each person derives from them his disposition, which is his inclination. This is supported by reason and by experience. For likeness to parents is clearly to be seen as regards face, character and behaviour in their children, their immediate descendants, as well as in their more remote descendants through their children. Many are able by this means to recognise families and to form judgments about their characters. It is therefore the evils acquired by the parents themselves and so passed on to their offspring which are the evils with which people are born. The belief that Adam's guilt is imprinted on the whole human race is due to the fact that few people reflect on any evil they have and so come to know it. They therefore hold the opinion that it is so deeply hidden as to be invisible except in the sight of God.</p><p>[2] Secondly, a person is brought into a state of good by being regenerated by the Lord. The fact of regeneration and that without it a person cannot enter heaven is plainly stated by the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">5</a>. Regeneration is being purified from evils and so having one's life renewed; this cannot be unknown in the Christian world, for reason too can see this when it acknowledges that everyone is born in a state of evil, and evil cannot be washed or wiped away like dirt by means of soap and water, but by means of coming to one's senses.</p><p>[3] Thirdly, a person is brought into a state of good by the Lord through living in accordance with His commandments. There are five commandments necessary for regeneration (<a href="82.htm">82</a> above), including the following. Evils are to be shunned, because they are the devil's and come from him; and good deeds are to be done because they are God's and come from Him; the Lord is to be approached praying that He may cause them to do these things. Let everyone examine himself and consider whether a person has any other source of good; and without good he cannot be saved.</p><p>[4] Fourthly, good, being thus implanted, cannot be copied. Copying means the transference of one person's good to another. The consequence of what has been said above is that through regeneration a person is made completely new as regards his spirit, and this takes place through living in accordance with the Lord's commandments. No one can fail to see that this renewal can only happen from time to time, very much as a tree by stages takes root from a seed, growing up and being made complete. Those with a different idea of regeneration are utterly ignorant of the human condition, and of evil and good as being total opposites, so that good can only be implanted to the extent that evil is removed. Nor are they aware that so long as anyone is in a state of evil, he loathes good which is essentially good. If therefore one person's good were to be transferred into someone in a state of evil, it would be like throwing a lamb to a wolf, or like a pearl tied on a pig's snout. This makes it plain that copying is impossible. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #525 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>525. 2. A transfer of one person's good to another is impossible. Clear evidence of this may be seen as well from the following considerations in turn:<p>1. Every person is born into a state of evil.<p>2. He is brought into a state of good by the Lord through regeneration.<p>3. This is accomplished through his living a life in accordance with the Lord's precepts.<p>4. Consequently good, when so implanted, cannot be transferred.<p>First, that every person is born into a state of evil. This is known in the church. It is said that this evil comes by inheritance from Adam, but it comes from one's parents. Everyone derives from them an innate character in the form of a disposition. That this is so both reason and experience attest. For similarities to parents appear in their offspring's faces, natures and habits, in the first generation and in their posterity after them. Many people recognize to what families others belong and judge of their temperaments on that account. Consequently, it is the evils that the parents themselves have acquired and by transmission passed on to their offspring into which people are born.<p>People believe that the guilt of Adam has been impressed on the whole human race for the reason that few reflect upon any evil in themselves so as to recognize it in them. Consequently they suppose that it is so deeply hidden as not to appear except in the sight of God.</p><p>[2] Second, that a person is brought into a state of good by the Lord through regeneration. That rebirth or regeneration is possible, and that unless one is reborn or regenerated, he cannot enter into heaven, is clearly apparent from the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">5</a>. <sup >1</sup>It cannot be unknown in the Christian world that regeneration is a purification from evils and thus a renewal of life, for reason sees this also when it acknowledges that everyone is born into evil, and that evil cannot like dirt and grime be washed or wiped away by soap and water, but only by repentance.</p><p>[3] Third, that a person is brought into a state of good by the Lord through his living a life in accordance with the Lord's precepts. There are five precepts necessary for regeneration, which may be seen listed above in no. <a href="82.htm">82</a>. <sup >2</sup>Included among them are the following: that evils must be abstained from because they are of the devil and from the devil, and that good deeds must be done because they are of God and from God; also that people should turn to the Lord to lead them to do these things. Let everyone consider in himself and weigh whether a person obtains good from any other source. And if he does not obtain good, neither does he obtain salvation.</p><p>[4] Fourth, that good, when so implanted, cannot be transferred. By transfer we mean a transference of one person's good to another.<p>It follows from the observations made above that by regeneration a person is made entirely new in respect to his spirit, and that this is achieved through his living a life in accordance with the Lord's precepts. Who does not see that this renewal can be accomplished only in the process of time, much as a tree progressively takes root and grows from a seed and is perfected?<p>People who have another perception of regeneration do not know anything about a person's state, nor anything about evil and good, that these two are entirely opposed, and that good cannot be implanted except in the measure that evil is removed. Nor do they know that as long as a person is in a state of evil, he is antipathetic to any good that is good in itself. Consequently, if the good in one person were to be transferred to another in a state of evil, it would be like casting a lamb before a wolf, or like attaching a pearl to the snout of a pig.<p>It is apparent from this that a transfer is impossible.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"Jesus answered, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God....' '...unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'"<br><br>2.&nbsp;Namely,<br><br>1. There is one God, in whom is the Divine Trinity, and that God is the Lord Jesus Christ. <br><br>2. Saving faith is to believe in Him. <br><br>3. Evils must be abstained from because they are of the devil and from the devil. <br><br>4. Good deeds must be done because they are of God and from God. <br><br>5. These good deeds must be done by a person as though he were doing them from himself, but he must believe that they are from the Lord in him and by means of him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #525 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>525. 2. It is impossible to consign the good of one person to another.<p>The evidence of this can also be seen one thing at a time, like this:<p>(a) Every human is born with evil. (b) The Lord leads him into good through rebirth. (c) This is done through a life according to His teachings. (d) So the good implanted this way cannot be consigned to someone else.<p>(a) It is well known in the church that every person is born with evil. They say that this evil is inherited from Adam, but it is from your parents. You get your disposition, which is your inclination, from them. Reason and experience persuade that this is so, for similarities to parents in face, talents, and behavior come out in their near and distant descendants. Many people know families by this and form opinions about their minds. So the evils that the parents themselves have built up and implanted in their children by passing them on are the ones that people are born with. People think that Adam's sin is etched on the whole human race because few look into any evil in themselves and come to know it by that means. Therefore they suppose that it is so deeply hidden that only God sees it.<p>(b) The Lord leads a person into good through rebirth. It is clear from the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">5</a> that there is regeneration and that you cannot march into heaven without being remade. It can be no secret in the Christian world that rebirth is purification from evils and thus a renewal of life, for reason sees this, too, when it accepts that everyone is born with evil and that evil cannot be washed away and wiped off with soap and water like dirt, but must be cleansed with repentance.<p>(c) The Lord leads a person into good by life according to His teachings. There are five teachings about rebirth (seen above, no. 82). Among them are: avoid bad acts because they are the devil's and are from the devil, and do good acts because they are God's and are from God, and approach the Lord so that He can lead people to the doing of those things. Anyone can consider in his own mind and decide if man has good from anywhere else.<p>And if he does not have good, he does not have salvation.<p>(d) When this good is implanted it cannot be consigned to someone else. Consigning means transferring one person's good to another. It follows from the things said above that by rebirth a person is totally renewed in spirit, and this happens through a life according to the Lord's teachings. Who cannot see that this new beginning can only be done with time and in time, hardly different from the way a tree roots and grows from a seed and becomes a full - grown tree? People who see rebirth any other way know nothing about the human condition, and nothing about bad and good - that these two are totally opposite and that good can be implanted only so far as evil is removed. Nor do they know that so long as someone is preoccupied with evil he has his back turned to any good that is good in its own right. So if someone's good were transferred to anyone preoccupied with evil, it would be like tossing a sheep to a wolf or tying a pearl to a pig's nose.<p>From all this it is clear that transferring good is impossible. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #525 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>525. II. THAT THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THE GOOD OF ONE MAN INTO ANOTHER IS IMPOSSIBLE. The evidence of this also can be seen from the following heads in this order: 1. That every man is born in evil. 2. That by regeneration he is led into good by the Lord. 3. That this is done by a life according to His commandments. 4. Therefore good when thus implanted cannot be transcribed. FIRST: That every man is born in evil is known in the Church. It is said that this evil is by inheritance from Adam; but it is from the man's parents, it being from them that every one derives his disposition, that is, his inclination. As to this, both reason and experience bring conviction; for the parents' likeness in face, genius, and habits comes out in their children, and from them, in their descendants. It is from this that by many men families are recognized and judgment is made concerning their animi. <sup >1</sup>Therefore, the evils in which men are born are evils which the parents themselves have contracted and have conveyed to their offspring by transmission. The reason why it is believed that the guilt of Adam is inscribed on the whole human race is because few reflect upon and thus recognize any evil in themselves. Therefore they opine that it is so deeply hidden as not to appear except before God.</p><p>[2] SECOND: That by regeneration man is led into good by the Lord. The fact of regeneration and that unless one is regenerated he cannot enter heaven, is clearly evident from the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">5</a>. That regeneration is purification from evils and thus renovation of life, can be no secret in the Christian world, for reason also sees it when acknowledging that every man is born in evil, and that evil can be washed away and removed, not like dirt with soap and water, but only by repentance.</p><p>[3] THIRD: That man is led into good by the Lord by a life according to His commandments. The commandments of regeneration are the five which may be seen above, in no. <a href="82.htm">82</a>. Among them are these: That evils are to be shunned because they are of the devil and from the devil, and that goods are to be done because they are of God and from God; and that the Lord is to be approached that He may lead men to the doing of them. Let every one take counsel with himself and consider whether man has good from any other source; and if he does not have good he does not have salvation.</p><p>[4] FOURTH: That good when thus implanted cannot be transcribed. By transcription is meant the transcription of the good of one man into another. From what was said above, it follows that by regeneration a man is made wholly new as to his spirit, and that this is effected by a life according to the Lord's commandments. Who does not see that this renovation cannot be accomplished except from time to time, in almost the same way as from seed a tree successively takes root, grows, and is perfected? Those who perceive regeneration in any other way do not know anything concerning man's state, or concerning evil and good, that the two are altogether opposite, and that good cannot be implanted except so far as evil is removed. Nor do they know that so long as one is in evil he is averse to every good which in itself is good. Therefore, were the good of one to be transferred into another who is in evil, it would be as though a lamb were thrown to a wolf, or a pearl tied to the snout of a swine. From this it is manifest that transcription is impossible.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Throughout Swedenborg's theological and philosophical works, the word animus (plural, animi) is used to designate the external mind which man has in common with animals, as distinguished from mens designating the rational mind which is peculiar to man. Animus also means the disposition, and is sometimes so translated in the present work. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #525 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>525. <sup >1</sup>(ii) The transcription of one person's good into another person is impossible. How obvious this is may be seen from these propositions in turn: a) Every human being is born in evil. b) He is led into good through regeneration at the Lord's hands. c) This is effected by a life according to the Lord's commandments. d) Good, once so implanted, cannot be transcribed, therefore.<p>A) It is known in the Church that every human being is born in evil. The saying is that this evil is by inheritance from Adam, but it is from parents. Every one derives a nature from his parents, which is inclination. Reason and experience demonstrate the fact. For resemblance to parents in face, nature and manners comes out in the immediate children and in their descendants. Many thus recognize whole families and judge of their character. It is therefore the evils which the parents have contracted and passed by procreation to their progeny, into which human beings are born. The reason of the belief that Adam's guilt has been inscribed on the whole race, is that few men reflect on and hence know any evil in themselves. They therefore suppose that it is so deeply hidden that it does not appear except before God.</p><p>[2] b) Man is led into good through regeneration at the Lord's hands. It is plain from words of the Lord's (in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">5</a>) that there is such a process as regeneration and that one cannot enter heaven unless one is regenerated. It is bound to be known in the Christian world that regeneration is purification from evils and thus a renewal of life. For reason sees this, too, after it acknowledges that every one is born in evil and that evil cannot be washed and wiped away as filth can with soap and water, but only through repentance.</p><p>[3] c) Man is led into good by the Lord through a life according to His commandments. The commandments of regeneration are five (see above,<a href="82.htm">82</a>). Among them are these: Evils are to be shunned because they are of the devil and from the devil, and goods are to be done because they are of God and from God, and the Lord is to be approached, that He may lead men to do them. Let every one take counsel and consider whether man has good from elsewhere; and if he has not good, he has not salvation.</p><p>[4] d) Good, when thus implanted, cannot be transcribed. By transcription we mean the transcription of one person's good into another person. From what was said above it follows that the human being is made altogether new in spirit by regeneration, and that this is accomplished by a life according to the Lord's commandments. Who does not see that this renewal can be accomplished only in the process of time, much as a tree gradually takes root and grows from seed and is perfected? Those who conceive of regeneration otherwise, know nothing of man's state nor do they know about evil and good that these two are entirely opposite, and that good cannot be implanted except in the measure that evil is removed. Nor do they know that as long as one is in evil he is averse to good which in itself is good. If then one person's good were to be transferred into any one in evil, it would be as if a lamb were flung to a wolf or as though a pearl were fastened on the snout of a pig. It is plain from these considerations that transcription is impossible.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See Brief Exposition,<a href="111.htm">111</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #525 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>525. (2) That transcription of the good of one into another is impossible. The evidence of this also can be seen from these considerations in order:<p>(1) That every man is born in evil<p>(2) That he is led into good by the Lord, through regeneration.<p>(3) That this is done by a life according to His commandments.<p>(4) Therefore the good which is thus implanted cannot be transcribed.<p>(1) That every man is born in evil is known in the church. It is said that this evil is by inheritance from Adam; but it is from the parents. everyone derives his disposition, which is inclination, from them. Reason and experience prove that this is so, for the likeness to the parents, in face, in genius, and in manners, is manifest, in the immediate children, and in the posterities from them. Hence families are known by many, and judgment as to their minds is formed. The evils therefore, in which men are born are those that the parents themselves have contracted, and have passed on by derivation to their offspring. The reason why it is believed that the guilt of Adam is inscribed upon the whole human race, is that few reflect upon any evil in themselves, and thence know it.<p>They therefore, suppose it to be so deeply hidden as not to appear except before God.<p>(2) That man is led into good by the Lord, through regeneration. That there is regeneration, and that no one can enter heaven unless he is regenerated, is very plain from the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">5</a>. That regeneration is purification from evils, and thus renovation of the life, cannot be unknown in the Christian world; for reason also sees this, when it acknowledges that everyone is born in evil, and that evil cannot be washed and purged away like filth with soap and water, but by repentance.<p>(3) That man is led into good by the Lord, through a life according to His commandments. The commandments of regeneration are five, which may be seen above, n. <a href="82.htm">82</a>. Among them are these: That evils are to be shunned because they are of the devil, and from the devil; and, That goods are to be done because they are of God, and from God; and, That the Lord is to be approached in order that He may lead men to the doing of these commandments. Let everyone consult himself, and consider whether a man has good from any other source, and if not good he has not salvation.<p>(4) That good when thus implanted cannot be transcribed. By transcription is meant the transcription of the good of one into another. It follows from what has been said above, that by regeneration a man as to his spirit is made altogether new, and that this is effected by a life according to the Lord's commandments. Who does not see that this renovation cannot be accomplished except from time to time, scarcely otherwise than as a tree successively takes root and grows from the seed, and is perfected. Those who conceive otherwise of regeneration know nothing of man's state; nor anything about evil and good, that these two are altogether opposite, and that good cannot be implanted except as evil is removed. Nor do they know that so long as anyone is in evil he is averse to good which in itself is good. If therefore, the good of one could be transferred into anyone who is in evil, it would be as if a lamb were cast to a wolf, or as a pearl tied to the snout of a hog. From which it is manifest that inscription is impossible. </p>

Quare bonum, cum ita implantatur, non potest transcribi. <p>Primum, quod unusquisque homo nascatur in malo, in Ecclesia notum est; dicitur quod hoc malum sit haereditario ex Adamo; sed est ex parentibus; ab his ducit quisque indolem, quae est inclinatio; quod ita sit, ratio et experientia convincunt; similitudines enim parentum quoad facies, genios et mores in proximis liberis et in posteris ex his, exstant; inde a multis noscuntur familiae, et quoque judicatur de illorum animis; quare mala, quae ipsi parentes contraxerunt, et per traducem in proles intulerunt, sunt in quibus homines nascuntur: quod credatur, quod reatus Adami inscriptus sit omni generi humano, est quia pauci super aliquod malum reflectunt apud se, et inde sciunt id, quare opinantur, quod sit tam alte reconditum, ut non appareat nisi coram Deo.</p><p>[2] Secundum, quod homo in bonum inducatur per regenerationem a Domino; quod sit Regeneratio, et quod nisi quis regeneratur, non possit ingredi in Coelum, patet clare a Domini verbis apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_3-5" target=_top>Johan. 3:3-5</a>; quod Regeneratio sit purificatio a malis, et sic renovatio vitae, non potest in Christiano Orbe latere, nam ratio etiam hoc videt dum agnoscit quod unusquisque nascatur in malo, et quod malum non possit ablui et abstergi sicut sordes per saponem et aquam, sed per resipiscentiam. </p><p>[3] Tertium, quod homo inducatur in bonum a Domino per vitam secundum praecepta Ipsius; praecepta regenerationis sunt quinque, quae videantur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_525/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_82" target=_top>82</a>, inter quae sunt haec, quod fugienda sint mala, quia sunt diaboli et a diabolo, et quod facienda sint bona quia sunt Dei et a Deo, et quod adeundus sit Dominus, ut adducat illos ad faciendum illa; consulat quisque se, et expendat, num aliunde homini bonum; et si non bonum, non ei est salus.</p><p>[4] Quartum, quod bonum, cum ita implantatur, non possit transcribi; per transcriptionem intelligitur transcriptio boni unius in alterum: ex supradictis consequitur, quod homo per regenerationem innovetur prorsus quoad spiritum, et quod hoc fiat per vitam secundum praecepta Domini; quis non videt, quod haec innovatio non fieri possit nisi a tempore in tempus, <sup>1</sup>vix aliter quam sicut successive radicatur et crescit arbor a semine, et perficitur: illi qui aliter percipiunt regenerationem, non sciunt aliquid de statu hominis, nec aliquid de malo et bono, quod haec duo sint prorsus opposita, et quod bonum non possit implantari nisi quantum removetur malum; nec sciunt quod quamdiu quis in malo est, aversetur bonum quod in se bonum est; quare si bonum unius transferretur <sup>2</sup>in quendam qui in malo est, foret sicut agnus conjiceretur coram lupo, aut sicut margarita alligaretur naribus porci: ex quibus patet, quod transcriptio impossibilis sit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: tempus;<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: transferreretur </p>
