<h4 align="center"></h4><p>323、⑹鳏夫与少女的婚姻状态也不同于鳏夫与寡妇的。原因在于，鳏夫早已被引入婚姻生活，而少女尚未被引入其中。然而，婚姻之爱在将彼此引入的过程中觉察并感受它的欢喜和快乐。少男丈夫和少女妻子在临到他们的一切事上，总能觉察并感受到某种新鲜东西，以致他们处于不断发现和愉快发展的状态。鳏夫与少女的婚姻状态则不同；少女妻子会感受到一种内在向往，而男人的这种向往早就过去了。不过，这些问题多种多样，各不相同；鳏夫与寡妇的婚姻同样如此。所以，除了这种大致概念外，我不方便补充具体细节。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>323、（6）鳏夫与处女婚姻状态与鳏夫与寡妇的婚姻状态不同。原因是鳏夫有过婚姻生活，而处女却没有。而婚姻之爱的快乐存在于相互的发展过程中。处男与处女会在他们经历的过程中感到新的东西，在这一过程中他们经历一种相互的令人愉悦的过程。鳏夫和处女的状态是不同的。处女妻子有一种内在的渴望，而在男人身上这种渴望已经过去了。但是这种婚姻也有多种情况，与鳏夫和寡妇的婚姻一样，在此不能详细例举。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #323 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>323. (vi) The state of a marriage between a widower and a young woman is different from that between a widower and a widow.<p>A widower has long since passed the initial stage of married life, and a maiden is still to be introduced to it. Yet conjugial love perceives and feels its pleasure and joy in introducing each to the other. The young husband, and the maiden wife, keep perceiving and feeling something new in what happens to them, so that they are in a continual state of discovery and so of welcome development. If a widower marries a maiden, their married state is different; the maiden wife feels an inward inclination, but for the man this is past. But in these matters there is great variety and diversity. Likewise, if a widower marries a widow. Apart from this general idea therefore I am not free to add specific details. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #323 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>323. 6. The marriage of a widower with a virgin likewise differs in state from the marriage of a widower with a widow. The reason is that the widower has been introduced into married life already, while the virgin still needs to be introduced; and yet conjugial love perceives and feels its pleasure and delight in a mutual introduction. An inexperienced husband and inexperienced wife perceive and feel always something new in the states that befall them, on which account they encounter a kind of continual introduction and consequent lovely progression. The state is different in the marriage of a widower with a virgin. The virgin wife feels an inner yearning, which in the man has passed. But in marriages of this sort there is much variety and diversity, likewise in the marriage between a widower and widow; and therefore we cannot add anything more specific beyond this general observation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #323 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>323. 6. And the state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is different from that of a widower with a widow, for a widower has already been initiated into married life, and the virgin is about to be introduced.<p>But married love perceives and feels its pleasure and joy in initiation for both at once. The young husband and the young wife notice and feel things that are ever new in what goes on by way of initiation. Due to these things they are in a kind of continual initiation and therefore in a lovely process. It happens differently in the married state of a widower with a virgin. The virgin wife has an inner inclination, but it has passed by for the man. But in these matters there are many variations and diversities. The same goes for a marriage between a widower and a widow. So beyond a general notion of them nothing specific can be added. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #323 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>323. VI. ALSO THAT THE STATE OF MARRIAGE OF A WIDOWER WITH A VIRGIN IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A WIDOWER WITH A WIDOW; for the widower has already been initiated into the conjugial life, and the virgin is still to be initiated, and yet conjugial love perceives and feels its pleasantness and delight in mutual initiation. In all that comes to them, the youthful husband and the virgin wife perceive and sensate things ever new, and thereby they are in a continual initiation and thence in a lovely progression. Not so in the state of marriage of a widower with a virgin. The virgin wife has an internal inclination, but with the man this has passed away. But in these marriages, and likewise in the marriage between a widower and a widow, there is much variety and diversity; therefore, beyond this general notion, it is of no use to add anything in detail. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #323 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>323. (vi) The state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is also one thing, and of a widower with a widow another thing. For the widower has already been initiated into the married life, while the virgin is to be initiated; but marital love perceives and feels pleasantness and joy in mutual initiation. The young husband and the virgin wife perceive and feel something new always at each turn, as a result of which they are in a certain continual initiation and lovely progress. The state is different in the marriage of a widower with a virgin. The virgin wife has an inner inclination, which is a thing of the past with the man. But in all this there is much variety and diversity. Similarly in a marriage between a widower and a widow. Beyond the general thought, therefore, nothing specific can be added. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #323 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>323. (6) Also, that the state of marriage of a widower with a virgin is of one kind, and that of a widower with a widow of another. For the widower has already been initiated into marriage life, and the virgin is to be initiated, yet conjugial love perceives and feels its pleasantness and delight in mutual initiation. A youth-husband and a virgin-wife are all the time perceiving and feeling what is new in the things that come to pass, whereby they are in a kind of perpetual initiation and thence in a lovely progression. It is otherwise in the state of the marriage of a widower with a virgin; the virgin-wife has an internal inclination, but with the man that has passed away. But in these respects there is much variety and diversity; in like manner in the marriage between a widower and a widow, and therefore, beyond this general notion it is not allowed to add anything specific. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #323 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>323. VI: Quod etiam alius status conjugii sit vidui cum virgine, et alius vidui cum vidua. Viduus enim jamdum in vitam conjugialem initiatus est, et virgo initianda est; et tamen amor conjugialis percipit et sentit <sup>1</sup>amaenum et jucundum suum in mutua initiatione; percipit et sentit juvenis maritus et virgo uxor in obvenientibus semper nova, ex quibus in continua quadam initiatione et inde amabili progressione sunt: aliter fit in statu conjugii vidui cum virgine; virgini uxori interna inclinatio est, at apud virum illa transiit; sed in his datur varietas et diversitas multa; similiter in conjugio inter viduum et viduam; quare praeter notionem illam communem, non licet aliquid specifice adjungere.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: sentit, </p>
