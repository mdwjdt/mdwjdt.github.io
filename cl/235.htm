<h4 align="center"></h4><p>235、⑴既有属灵之热，也有属灵之冷；属灵之热是爱，属灵之冷是爱的缺失。属灵之热唯独出自灵界太阳，而非其它源头。事实上，灵界有一轮太阳，它是从主发出的，主就在这太阳中间。灵界太阳因来自主，故本质上是纯粹的爱。在天使看来，这太阳就像一团火，犹如我们世界的太阳在我们眼里的样子。它之所以显为火，是因为爱是属灵之火。这太阳放射出热和光，但由于它是纯粹的爱，故它所产生的热本质上是爱，所产生的光本质上是智慧。由此明显可知属灵之热是从哪里来的，并且这热就是爱。<br><br>有必要用几句话来解释一下属灵之冷的源头。它源于自然界的太阳及其热和光。自然界的太阳被造是为了让它的热和光能将属灵的热和光接收到自己里面，并通过大气这个媒介将它们传到世上的最末层，好叫它们能执行主在自己的太阳中想要达到的目的，还能给属灵事物披上合适的衣服，也就是物质材料，以便主在自然界中的终极目的开始生效。当属灵之热与属世之热从内在联结起来时，这一切就会实现。但是，当属世之热与属灵之热分离时，如那些热爱属世事物，弃绝属灵事物之人的情形，结果正好相反。对他们来说，属灵之热就会变成属灵之冷。被造为和谐一致的这两种热之所以变得如此对立，是因为作为主人的热变成了作为仆人的热，反之亦然。为防止这种情况发生，凭其血统而出身为主人的属灵之热会退去；属灵之热便在这些接受器皿中逐渐冷却，因为它变成了反面。由此明显可知何为属灵之冷，它其实是属灵之热的缺失。<br><br>刚才所说的热当理解为爱，因为这热被活物感觉为爱。在灵界，我曾听说，纯属世的灵人来到一位处于爱之状态的天使身边时，就会感到刺骨的寒冷。当天上的热临到地狱灵时，他们的感受也是这样。然而，在他们自己中间，当天上的热与他们隔绝时，他们就会遭受酷热的炙烤。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>235、（1）人会经历精神上的温暖和精神上的冷漠。精神上的温暖就是爱，精神上的冷漠就是爱的缺乏及爱的丧失。</p><p>精神上的温暖来自于精神世界的太阳。那里的太阳来自于主，主处于其中。因此这种温暖的实质就是爱。这一太阳在天使看来是一团火，与在世间时的太阳一样。它呈现为一团火是因为爱就是精神的火，这一太阳放出热和光。因为这一太阳就是爱，所以来自这一太阳的热的实质是爱，光的实质是智慧。</p><p>虽然我们知道了精神上的温暖的来源，并且知道精神上的温暖就是爱。</p><p>精神上的冷漠来自于自然界的太阳的光和热。</p><p>自然界的太阳能够接受精神上的光和热，并传递到世上最低层的物质中。主在这一过程中使精神上的事物拥有物质的载体，这就是为什么精神之热能与自然之热结合并保留在其中。</p><p>相反，当自然之热与精神之热相分离时，也就是当人们只追求自然之物而忽视精神之物时，在他们中，精神之热变得冷却，这两种热生来是相互和谐的，却变成相互冲突的。处主导地位的热变成了被动的地位，这时精神之热就会退却，而它是应该处于主导地位的，在那些接受者身上，精神之热变冷了，因为它被排斥了。</p><p>很明显可以看到精神上的冷漠是指什么——它是指缺乏或丧失了精神之热。</p><p>我在精神世界中听说只有自然的精灵会经历这种强烈的精神上的冷漠。同时那些地狱里的精灵也会在天国之热流向它们时产生这种冷漠。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #235 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>235. (i) There is spiritual heat and spiritual coldness; spiritual heat is love, and spiritual coldness is being deprived of love.<p>Spiritual heat comes from no other source than the sun of the spiritual world. For there is a sun there which comes forth from the Lord, who is in the midst of it. Since it is from the Lord, that sun in essence <sup >1</sup>is undiluted love. This sun looks to the angels like a fire, exactly as the sun of our world does to us. This fiery appearance is because love is spiritual fire. This sun radiates heat and light, but since this sun is undiluted love, the heat it produces is in essence love, and the light it produces is in essence wisdom. This makes it plain what the source of spiritual heat is, and that this is love.</p><p>[2] However, a few remarks must be made about the source of spiritual coldness. This comes from the sun of the natural world, and from its heat and light. The sun of the natural world was created so that its heat and light could receive into themselves spiritual heat and light, and convey these through the atmospheres to the final level on earth. This was so that they could carry out the Lord's purposes which He intends in His own sun, and also could cover spiritual things with suitable clothing, that is, materials, in order to execute His ultimate purposes in nature. These results take place when spiritual heat is combined with natural heat. But the result is the reverse, when natural heat is separated from spiritual heat, which is the case with those who love natural things and reject spiritual ones. In their case spiritual heat turns into spiritual coldness. The reason why those two kinds of heat, <sup >2</sup>created to be in harmony, become so opposed is that then the master heat becomes the servant heat, and vice versa. To prevent this happening, spiritual heat, which is by its lineage the master, withdraws; and then in these cases spiritual heat grows cold, because it becomes its opposite. These considerations make plain the nature of spiritual coldness, as being deprived of spiritual heat.</p><p>[3] In what has just been said heat is understood to mean love, because that heat is felt by living <sup >3</sup>things that it affects as love. I have been told in the spiritual world that purely natural spirits feel an intense cold, when they come alongside an angel who is in a state of love. Likewise the spirits of hell, when heat from heaven reaches them; yet among themselves, when the heat of heaven is shut off from them, they broil with great heat.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="380.htm">380</a>[11], <a href="../tcr/33.htm">True Christian Religion 33</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #235 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>235. 1. People experience spiritual warmth and spiritual coldness; and spiritual warmth is love, while spiritual coldness is its absence and loss. Spiritual warmth originates from no other source than the sun of the spiritual world. For the sun there is an emanation from the Lord, who is in the midst of it; and being from the Lord, in its essence that sun is pure love. That sun appears to angels as a ball of fire, just as the sun of our world does to men. It appears as a ball of fire because love is spiritual fire. From that sun emanate both heat and light, but because that sun is pure love, the heat from it in its essence is love, and the light from it in its essence is wisdom.<p>This makes clear the origin of spiritual warmth and the fact that it is love.</p><p>[2] The origin of spiritual coldness, moreover, will also be briefly explained. It originates from the sun of the natural world and its heat and light.<p>The sun of the natural world was created so that its heat and light might receive into them spiritual heat and light and by means of its atmospheres convey them even to the lowest elements in the world. Their purpose was to produce the effects of those ends which, being the Lord's, exist in the spiritual sun, and also to clothe spiritual things with coverings or materials adequate to bring about final ends in nature. This is what happens when spiritual heat is joined to and contained in natural heat.<p>The contrary happens, however, when natural heat is separated from spiritual heat, as is the case in people who love natural things and reject spiritual ones. In them spiritual warmth becomes coldness. These two kinds of heat, by creation in harmony, thus become opposed to each other, and the reason is that the master heat then becomes the servant heat, and the servant heat the master. So, to keep this from happening, spiritual heat withdraws, which by right of its origin is the master; and spiritual warmth in these recipient vessels then grows cold, because it becomes opposed.<p>[3] In what we have just said, by heat we mean love, because spiritual heat in animate recipients is felt as love.<p>I have heard in the spiritual world that merely natural spirits experience an intense coldness whenever they attach themselves to the side of some angel who is feeling a state of love. Also that spirits in hell have the same experience whenever warmth from heaven flows in upon them - even though among themselves, when the warmth of heaven is shut off and withdrawn, they burn with great heat. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #235 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>235. 1. There is spiritual heat, and there is spiritual cold. Spiritual heat is love, and spiritual cold is love removed. The one source of spiritual heat is the sun of the spiritual world - for there is a sun there. It radiates from the Lord, who is within it. Being from the Lord, that sun is an expression of pure love. To the angels it looks fiery, just as the sun of our world does to people. It looks fiery because love is spiritual fire. That sun puts out both heat and light, but since it is pure love, the essence of its heat is love, and the essence of its light is wisdom. This shows where spiritual heat comes from, and that it is love.<p>Now to explain in a few words where spiritual cold is from.<p>It is from the sun of the natural world and from its heat and light.<p>The sun of the natural world was created to receive spiritual heat and light into its own heat and light and carry these things, through the atmospheres, to every last thing on earth. The purpose was for heat and light to produce results from the intentions that are the Lord's in His sun. Also, heat and light were for clothing spiritual things in the right clothes - materials to make the Lord's intentions work in nature. This happens when spiritual heat joins earthly heat, from within it. But the opposite happens when earthly heat is separated from spiritual heat, as it is with those who love natural things and reject spiritual things. For them spiritual heat becomes cold.<p>The reason why these two loves become opposites like this, though created to work together, is that in such a case the master heat becomes the servant heat, and vice versa. To prevent this, spiritual heat, which is master by birth, withdraws. Spiritual heat then grows cold for those people, because it becomes the opposite.<p>This shows what spiritual cold is - spiritual heat removed.<p>In what I am saying, heat means love, because living creatures feel spiritual heat as love. I have heard in the spiritual world that worldly - minded spirits grow intensely cold when they are beside an angel who is in a state of love, and so do spirits of hell when influenced by heat from heaven. Yet, among themselves, with the heat from heaven shut off from them, they burn with great heat. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #235 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>235. I. THAT THERE IS SPIRITUAL HEAT AND SPIRITUAL COLD;AND THAT SPIRITUAL HEAT IS LOVE AND SPIRITUAL COLD THE DEPRIVATION THEREOF. Spiritual heat is from no other source than the sun of the spiritual world; for there is a sun there, proceeding from the Lord who is in the midst of it; and being from the Lord, that sun in its essence <sup >1</sup>is pure love. Before the angels, it appears as fiery, just as the sun of our world appears before men--that it appears fiery is because love is spiritual fire. From it proceed both heat and light; but because that sun is pure love, the heat therefrom in its essence is love, and the light therefrom in its essence is wisdom. From this it is evident whence comes spiritual heat, and that this heat is love.</p><p>[2] The source of spiritual cold shall also be explained in a few words. It is from the sun of the natural world and from the heat and light thereof. The sun of the natural world was created, that its heat and light may receive into themselves spiritual heat and light, and by the mediation of atmospheres, may convey them to things ultimate on earth, in order to make actual the effects of the ends which are the Lord's in His sun; and also to clothe spiritual things with adequate garments, that is, with matters, that ultimate ends may become operative in nature. This is effected when spiritual heat is joined from within to natural heat. But the opposite comes to pass when natural heat is separated from spiritual heat, which is the case with those who love natural things and reject spiritual. With them, spiritual heat becomes cold. That these two [heats or] loves, which from creation are concordant, then become opposed, is because the master heat then becomes the servant, and the reverse. That this may not happen, spiritual heat, which by its lineage is the master, withdraws. In these subjects, spiritual heat then grows cold because it becomes the opposite. What spiritual cold is, namely, that it is the deprivation of spiritual heat, is thus evident.</p><p>[3] In what has been said above, by [spiritual] heat is meant love, because in living subjects that heat is felt as love. I have heard in the spiritual world that spirits who are merely natural grow intensely cold when they place themselves at the side of an angel who is in a state of love, and that it is the same with the spirits of hell when heat flows into them out of heaven; and yet, that among themselves, when the heat of heaven is shut off from them, they burn with great heat.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin is existentia, but the general teaching of the Writings indicates that this a slip for essentia as in the translation.

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #235 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>235. (i) There is spiritual warmth and spiritual cold, spiritual warmth being love, and spiritual cold the absence of love. Spiritual warmth has but one source - the sun of the spiritual world. For there is a sun in that world, proceeding from the Lord, who is in the midst of it. Being from the Lord, that sun in its nature is pure love. It appears fiery in the eyes of the angels, quite as the sun of our world does in the eyes of men; it so appears because love is spiritual fire. From it proceed both heat and light, but as that sun is pure love, the warmth thence in its essence is love, and the light thence in its essence wisdom. It is plain then whence spiritual warmth is, and that it is love. The source of spiritual cold shall also be told briefly. Spiritual cold is from the sun of the natural world and from its heat and light. The sun of the natural world was created that its heat and light might receive spiritual heat and light and convey them by means of atmospheres even to outermost things on earth, so as to work out the effects of the ends which the Lord has in His sun, and also to clothe spiritual things with suitable garments, that is, with matter, for expressing last ends in nature. This is accomplished when spiritual heat is added in the natural. But the contrary happens when natural heat is separated from spiritual heat, which is the case with those who love natural things and reject spiritual things. With these, spiritual warmth turns cold. The two loves concordant by creation thus become opposed, for the master warmth becomes the servant, and vice versa. To escape servitude, spiritual warmth (which is lord by lineage) retreats and turns cold in such people, because it is made opposite. From this it is plain what spiritual cold is, namely, the absence of spiritual warmth. In what we are saying, we mean love by "warmth," for spiritual heat in animate subjects is felt as love. I have heard in the spiritual world that merely natural spirits grow intensely cold when they attach themselves to the side of an angel who is in a state of love; and that infernal spirits do likewise when heat flows to them from heaven; and yet that among themselves, when heaven's heat is shut away from them, they grow very warm. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #235 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>235. (1) That there is spiritual heat, and that there is spiritual cold; and spiritual heat is love, and spiritual cold is deprivation of love. Spiritual heat is from no other source than<p>from the sun of the spiritual world. For there is a sun there proceeding from the Lord who is in the midst of it. And as it is from the Lord, in its existence that sun is pure love. This sun appears to the angels fiery, altogether as the sun of our world appears before men. The reason why it appears fiery is that love is spiritual fire. From that sun proceed heat and light; but as that sun is pure love the heat from it is love in its essence, and the light from it in its essence is wisdom. From this it is plain whence comes spiritual heat, and that it is love. And it shall also be explained in few words whence spiritual cold is. It is from the sun of the natural world, and from its heat and light. The sun of the natural world was created in order that its heat and light may receive into themselves spiritual heat and light, and convey these by means of atmospheres even to the very ultimates in the earth, to the end that they may make effects of the ends which are the Lord's in His sun, and also that they may clothe spiritual things in adequate garments, that is with materials for working out ultimate ends in nature. These things are effected when spiritual heat is joined within to natural heat. But the opposite takes place when natural heat is separated from spiritual heat, which it is with those who love natural things and reject spiritual. With them spiritual heat becomes cold. The reason why these two loves, by creation concordant, thus become opposite, is that the master - heat then becomes the servant - heat, and vice versa; and that this may not be, spiritual heat, which by its lineage is master, withdraws, and then in those subjects spiritual heat is cold, because it becomes opposite. From this it is plain what spiritual cold is, that it is the privation of spiritual heat.<p>In what is now said, by heat is meant love, because that heat in living subjects is felt as love. I have heard in the spiritual world that spirits who are merely natural are cold, with intense cold, when they apply themselves to the side of any angel who is in a state of love; and likewise infernal spirits when the heat of heaven flows in among them; and yet that among themselves, when the heat of heaven is excluded from them they burn with great heat </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #235 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>235. I: Quod sit Calor spiritualis, et quod sit Frigus spirituale; et quod Calor Spiritualis sit Amor, et Frigus Spirituale privatio ejus. Calor Spiritualis non aliunde est, quam ex Sole Mundi spiritualis; est enim ibi Sol procedens a Domino, Qui est in medio ejus; et quia est a Domino, est Sol ille in sua essentia <sup>1</sup>purus Amor; hic Sol apparet coram Angelis igneus, prorsus sicut apparet Sol nostri Mundi coram hominibus; quod appareat igneus, est quia Amor est ignis spiritualis: ex illo Sole procedit et Calor et Lux; sed quia Sol ille est purus amor, est calor inde in sua essentia amor, et lux inde in sua essentia sapientia; inde patet, unde calor spiritualis, et quod sit amor.</p><p>[2] Unde autem est Frigus spirituale, paucis etiam evulgabitur; est illud ex Sole Mundi naturalis, exque ejus calore et luce; Sol Mundi Naturalis est creatus, ut ejus calor et lux in se recipiant calorem et lucem spiritualem, et mediis athmosphaeris ferant hos usque ad ultima in Tellure, ut efficiant effectus finium, qui sunt Domini in suo Sole, et quoque ut amiciant spiritualia vestibus adaequatis, hoc est, materiis, ad operandum fines ultimos in natura; haec fiunt, cum calor spiritualis injunctus est calori naturali: at contrarium fit, dum separatur calor naturalis a calore spirituali, quod fit apud illos, qui amant naturalia, ac rejiciunt spiritualia; apud hos fit calor spiritualis frigus; quod bini illi calores <sup>2</sup>ex creatione concordes, fiant ita oppositi, est causa, quia tunc calor dominus fit calor servus, ac vicissim; et ne hoc fiat, recedit calor spiritualis, qui ex sua stirpe est dominus; et tunc in subjectis illis calor spiritualis friget, quia <sup>3</sup>fit oppositus: ex his patet, quid frigus spirituale, et quod sit privatio caloris spiritualis.</p><p>[3] In nunc dictis per calorem intelligitur amor, quia calor ille in subjectis viventibus <sup>4</sup>sentitur ut amor. Audivi in Mundo spirituali, quod Spiritus mere naturales frigeant intenso frigore, dum applicant se lateri cujusdam Angeli, qui in statu amoris est: et quod similiter spiritus inferni, dum calor e Coelo ad illos influit; et quod tamen inter se, cum ab illis seclusus est calor coeli, aestuent calore magno.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: existentia<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: amores<br><br>3.&nbsp;Prima editio: quia,<br><br>4.&nbsp;Prima editio: vivens </p>
