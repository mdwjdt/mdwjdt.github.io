<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #378 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>378. (xiii) There is even jealousy among animals and among birds.<p>It is well known that wild animals, such as lions, tigers, bears and many more display jealousy when they have young. So also do bulls, even if they have no calves; and to a very high degree so do cocks, which fight rivals for their hens even to the death. The reason cocks show such jealousy is that they are boastful lovers, and boasting about that kind of love tolerates no equal; it is evident that as boastful lovers they outdo every kind and species of bird from their movements, nods, strutting, and the noise they make. It was proved above that the way men, whether lovers or not, boast of their position induces, increases and exacerbates jealousy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #378 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>378. 13. Jealousness is found also in animals and birds. People know that it is found in wild animals, such as lions, tigers, bears, and others, when they have their young. So, too, in bulls, even though they do not have calves.<p>It is very apparent in cocks, which battle with rivals over their hens, even to their death. They are possessed of such jealousness, because they are vainglorious lovers, and the vainglory of their love does not tolerate a rival. One can see that they are vainglorious lovers - more vainglorious than any other kind or species of bird - from their movements, the motions of their heads, their struttings, and the sounds they make.<p>We have already shown above in the case of men, that whether they feel any love or not, the vainglory of their honor induces, heightens, and exacerbates jealousness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #378 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>378. 13. Animals and birds also have jealousy. It is well known that animals such as lions, tigers, bears, and other wild beasts have jealousy when they have young. And also bulls even without young. And most outstandingly roosters, which spar with their rivals to the death for their hens. They have so much jealousy because they are vainglorious lovers, and the pride of that love does not brook an equal. It is clear from their bearing, the motions of their heads, their stride, and their voice that they are vainglorious lovers more than any other genus or species of bird. It was already established that a reputation for honor among men, whether lovers or not, brings on jealousy, heightens it, and sharpens it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #378 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>378. XIII. THAT THERE IS JEALOUSY ALSO WITH BEASTS AND BIRDS. That it exists with wild beasts, such as lions, tigers, bears, etc., when with their young, is well known; and also with bulls, even when there are no calves with them, and most conspicuously in cocks which fight with rivals for their hens, even to the death. The reason why these latter have such jealousy is because they are vainglorious lovers, and the glory of that kind of love does not brook an equal. That they are vainglorious lovers above every other genus and species of birds is apparent from their carriage, their nod, their gait, and their crowing. That with men, whether lovers or not, the glory of honor induces jealousy and exalts and sharpens it, has been confirmed above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #378 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>378. (xiii) Beasts and birds also feel jealousy. Every one knows that wild beasts, like lions, tigers, bears, and others, feel jealous while they have whelps. Bulls do even though there are no calves; most conspicuously cocks do which fight their rivals to the death for their hens. Cocks feel such violent jealousy because they are vainglorious lovers; the vainglory of their love will not endure an equal. How much more vainglorious they are as lovers than any other kind and species of birds is apparent from their carriage, the thrust of the head, their strut and cry. We showed above that among men, whether lovers or not, the glory of honor induces, heightens and sharpens jealousy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #378 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>378. (13) That there is jealousy also among beasts and among birds. That it exists among wild beasts-such as lions, tigers, bears, and many others-while they have young, is known; and also among bulls, although there are no calves. It is most conspicuous with cocks, which fight with rivals for their hens even to the death. The reason why there is such jealousy among them is that they are vainglorious lovers and the glory of that kind of love does not endure an equal. That they are vainglorious lovers beyond all other kinds and species of birds, is apparent in their carriage, their nod, their strut, and the sound of their voice. That the glory of honor among men, whether lovers or not lovers, excites, exalts, and aggravates jealousy, has been confirmed above. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #378 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>378. XIII. Quod Zelotypia etiam sit apud bestias et apud aves. Quod sit apud feras, ut leones, tigrides, ursos, et plures, dum illis catuli sunt, notum est; tum etiam apud tauros, tametsi illis non vituli: exstantissime apud gallos, qui pro gallinis suis cum rivalibus dimicant usque ad mortem: quod his talis Zelotypia sit, est quia sunt amatores gloriosi, ac gloria amoris istius non sustinet parem; quod illi sint amatores gloriosi prae omni genere et specie avium, ex illorum gestibus, nutibus, gressibus, et sonis apparet. Quod gloria honoris apud viros tam amatores quam non amatores, inducat, exaltet et asperet Zelotypiam, supra confirmatum est. </p>
