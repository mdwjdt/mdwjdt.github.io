<h4 align="center"></h4><p>327、这些实验过后，我对旁观者说：“你们已经从这三个实验证据看出属灵物与属世物之间的区别是何性质；同样看出为何属世人不为属灵人所见，属灵人也不为属世人所见。然而，他们在情感和思维，以及由此而来的同在方面却紧密联系在一起。”这时，我转向校长说：“这就是为何我在路上时，你时而看见我，时而看不见的原因。”言毕，只听见有声音从高层天堂对校长说：“请上到这里来。”于是，他就上去了，回来后，他说，天使和他一样，以前也不知道属灵物与属世物之间的这种区别，因为他们一直没有机会在一个同时处于两个世界的人身上进行比较；由于缺乏对比，故无从得知这些区别。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #327 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>327. At the conclusion of this conversation I said to the bystanders, 'You have seen from these three experimental proofs the nature of the distinction between the spiritual and the natural; likewise why the natural man is invisible to the spiritual, and the spiritual man to the natural. Yet they are closely associated as regards affections and thoughts, and so in presence. That is why, headmaster, when I was on my way I was now visible and now invisible to you.'<p>After this a voice was heard from the higher heaven saying to the headmaster, 'Come up here.' He went up, and on his return he said that angels, like himself, had not previously known the difference between the spiritual and the natural, because they had never been given the opportunity of making the comparison with a person who was simultaneously in both worlds; and these differences can only become known by making such a comparison. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #327 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>327. Following these events I said to the people standing by, "From the evidence of these three experiments you now see what the difference is between something spiritual and something natural; and also the reason why a natural person is not visible to a spiritual one, nor a spiritual person to a natural one - even though they are affiliated in respect to their affections and thoughts and so in respect to their presence. That, Headmaster, is why one moment you would see me on the way, and the next moment not."<p>After that we heard a voice from the higher heaven saying to the headmaster, "Come up here."<p>So he went up. And when he returned he said that like himself, the angels had not known before the differences that exist between something spiritual and something natural, owing to the fact that they had not previously been given an opportunity to contrast them in the case of a person who was at the same time in both worlds; and without the contrast these differences are not known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #327 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>327. When these things were done I said to the bystanders, "From these three experimental discoveries you've seen the kind of difference there is between spiritual and worldly, as well as the reason why a spiritual person doesn't see a worldly one, nor a worldly person a spiritual one. And yet they are together in feelings and thoughts and therefore in presence. That's why you sometimes saw me on the way, Master Teacher, and sometimes you didn't."<p>After this we heard a voice out of a higher heaven, saying to the master teacher, "Come up here." He went up, and came back, and said that before that, like himself, the angels had not known the differences between spiritual and earthly. The reason was that they had never before been around a person who was in both worlds at the same time, to provide some full comparison, and those differences are not found out without a comparison. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #327 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>327. After these experiments, I said to the bystanders: "From these three proofs of experience, you have seen the nature of the distinction between the spiritual and the natural, and also the reason why the natural man is not seen by the spiritual, or the spiritual man by the natural, and this despite the fact that as to affections and thoughts and as to presence therefrom, they are consociates." Then, addressing the Chief Teacher, I said, "This is the reason why, when I was on the way, I was now seen by you and now not seen."<p>After this, from a higher heaven was heard a voice addressed to the Chief Teacher, saying, "Come up hither." He then went up, and after returning, he said that the angels, like himself, had not previously known the differences between the spiritual and the natural, and this because no opportunity for comparing them in a man who was in both worlds at the same time, had hitherto been afforded, and in the absence of comparison, these differences cannot be known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #327 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>327. This demonstration ended, I said to the onlookers, "From these three experimental proofs you have seen what the distinction between spiritual and natural is like; and also the reason why the natural man does not appear to the spiritual, nor the spiritual man to the natural, although they are associated in affections and thoughts and hence as to presence. Now you have the reason, O head teacher, why I was seen by you at one moment along the way, and not seen the next."<p>Thereupon a voice was heard from the higher heaven saying to the head teacher, "Come up hither." He ascended and on his return said that like himself the angels had not previously known the differences between the spiritual and the natural, because no opportunity for comparison had presented itself in a man who was at the same time in both worlds, and apart from such comparison the differences cannot be learned. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #327 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>327. These things having been finished, I said to the bystanders, 'From these three proofs of experience you have seen what the difference is between the spiritual and the natural; and also the reason why the natural man does not appear to the spiritual, nor the spiritual man to the natural, although as to affections and thoughts and thence as to presence they are consociated. Hence it is, chief teacher, that on the way I was at one moment seen by you, and then again not seen.'<p>After this a voice was heard from the higher heaven saying to the chief teacher, 'Coma up hither.' And he ascended and returned, and said that the angels like himself had not before known the differences between the spiritual and the natural, for the reason that there had not before been any opportunity for comparison with any man who was at the same in both worlds, and without comparison these differences are not known. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #327 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>327. His peractis dixi ad adstantes, "ex his tribus experientiae indiciis, vidistis, quale est discrimen inter Spirituale et Naturale, et quoque causam, cur Naturalis homo non appareat Spirituali, nec Spiritualis homo Naturali; tametsi quoad affectiones et cogitationes, et inde praesentias consociati sunt: inde est, quod tibi, Archididascale, in via nunc visus sim, et nunc non visus." Post haec audita est vox e superiori Coelo ad Archididascalum, dicens, "ascende huc;" et ascendit, et rediit, et dixit, quod Angeli, sicut ipse, non prius noverint differentias inter Spirituale et Naturale, propter causam, quia non prius apud quendam hominem, qui in utroque Mundo simul fuit, aliqua copia relationis data est, ac differentiae illae absque relatione, non noscuntur. </p>
