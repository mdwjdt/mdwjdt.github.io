<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第344节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>344、我曾被允许感知一夫多妻者当中婚姻之爱的热是何性质。我与一个扮演穆罕默德的人交谈过。穆罕默德本人从未出现过，有一个代理人取代了他的位子，以便尘世的新来者认为他们看到他了。这个代理人从远处和我聊了一会儿，然后送给我一个象牙匙和其它标志物，以表明它们来自穆罕默德。同时，一条通道被打开了，以便传出那里所体验的婚姻之爱的热。我感觉这热类似澡堂里的恶臭热气；一感觉到它，我就转过身去，传出这热气的通道也关闭了。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>344、有一次，我被准许了解到一夫多妻制中的婚姻之爱是什么样的。我与一个穆哈默德的代表者谈过。这个人后来给我一个乌木勺和别的一些信物并说这些是来自于穆合默德。此时我体会到他们的婚姻之爱它就象是浴室中的热乎乎的臭气一样，感受到这些后，我转身离开了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #344 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>344. I was once allowed to perceive the nature of conjugial love among polygamists. I conversed with one who played the part of Mohammed. Mohammed himself is never present, but a substitute takes his place, so that newcomers from the world may think they see him. After conversing with me for a while at a distance, the substitute sent me an ivory spoon and other tokens that they came from him. At the same time a passage was opened up to transmit the heat of conjugial love experienced there. It was perceived by me as resembling the fetid warmth of a bath-house; on feeling it I turned away, and the passage by which it was transmitted was closed off. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #344 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>344. I was once given to perceive what the heat of the conjugial love of polygamists is like. I spoke with one who acted as a substitute for Muhammad. (Muhammad himself never appears, but a surrogate is substituted in his stead, in order that newcomers from the world may think they are seeing him.) This surrogate - after I had spoken with him awhile from a distance - sent over to me an ivory spoon and other tokens to indicate that they were from Muhammad. And at the same time, then, a way of communicating itself was opened for the heat of the conjugial love they had there. I perceived it as being like the fetid warmth of a bathhouse, on sensing which I turned away and the channel of communication was closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #344 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>344. Once I had a chance to learn what the warmth of the polygamists' married love is like. I spoke with someone who was making an appearance for Mohammed. Mohammed himself is never there, but a substitute takes his place so that new arrivals from the world can see him, in a sense. After I talked with this substitute for a while from a distance, he sent me an ebony spoon and other things as signs that he was Mohammed. And at that same time a way for me to feel the heat of their marital love there opened. And it struck me as like the heat of a bad - smelling public bath. I turned away when I smelled it, and the channel of communication closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #344 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>344. It was once granted me to perceive the nature of the heat of the conjugial love of polygamists. I spoke with one who took the place of Mohammed--Mohammed himself is never present but in place of him some substitute, and this to the end that new-comers from the world may see Mohammed, as it were. After some conversation with him from a distance, this substitute sent me an ebony spoon and other things which were tokens that they were from him. At the same time, communication was opened for the heat of the conjugial love of those who were there, and it was perceived by me as the fetid heat of a bath, perceiving which, I turned away and the channel of communication was closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #344 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>344. It was once given me to perceive what the heat of marital love is like with polygamists. I spoke with one who filled Mohammed's place. Mohammed himself is never present, but some one is substituted for him in order that those fresh from the world may seem to see him. This vicar, after I had had some speech with him at a distance, ordered an ebony spoon sent to me and other things which were supposed to show he was Mohammed. At the same time communication was opened for the heat of their marital love there. It seemed to me like the fetid heat of a bath; on perceiving it, I turned away, and the channel of communication was closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #344 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>344. It was once given me to perceive the quality of the heat of the conjugial love of polygamists. I spoke with one who occupied the place of Mahomet. Mahomet himself is never present, but a substitute deputed in his place, to the end that those recently from the world may as it were see him. This substitute, after some conversation with him from a distance, sent me an ebony spoon, and other things which were indications that it was from him. And at the same time communication was opened for the heat of the conjugial love of those who are there, and it was perceived by me as the fetid heat of a bagnio, perceiving which I turned away and the channel of communication was closed. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #344 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>344. Quondam datum est mihi percipere, qualis est calor amoris conjugialis polygamorum; loquutus sum cum uno, qui vicem Mahumedis obivit; ipse Mahumedes nusquam adest, sed vicarius loco ejus substitutus est, ob finem ut recentes e Mundo sicut videant illum; vicarius ille post aliquam loquelam e longinquo cum illo, transmisit ad me cochleare ebenum, et alia, quae erant indicia quod ab illo; et simul tunc aperta est communicatio pro calore amoris conjugialis illorum ibi; et ille a me perceptus est sicut calidum balnei foetidum; quo sentito averti me, et aditus communicativus occlusus est. </p>
