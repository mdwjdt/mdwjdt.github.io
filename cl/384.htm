<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第384节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>384、此后，第三位演讲者起身，发表了以下言论：“唯独爱，或唯独智慧都不是美丽的起源；它的起源是爱与智慧的联结，就是爱与少男里面的智慧之联结，以及智慧与它在少女里面的爱之联结。因为少女不是爱她自己里面的智慧，而是爱少男里面的智慧，这使得她将少男看为美丽；当少男在少女里面看到这一点时，也将她看为美丽。因此，爱藉着智慧形成那美丽，智慧则因着爱接受它。我已经在天上得到这一事实的可见证据。我在那里看到了少女和妻子，并观察了她们的美；发现少女的美完全不同于妻子的。在少女里面，我只看到这美的闪烁，而在妻子里面，则看到这美的光辉。这种区别犹如钻石的闪光与红宝石的火红之间的区别。美丽不就是视觉的快乐吗？这快乐的起源不就来自爱与智慧的玩耍吗？这种玩耍将这红光赋予视觉，这种闪耀在眼目之间颤动，并创造出美丽。若不是它的红润和白皙，以及它们的可爱调和彼此，又是什么使得面庞美丽呢？难道这红润不是出自爱，白皙不是出自智慧吗？事实上，爱从自己的火发出红光，智慧从自己的光变得亮白。在天上，我已经看到这二者明显表现在夫妻二人的脸上，妻子的脸白里透红，丈夫的脸则红里透白；并且我发现，正是彼此的注视使得他们的脸如此光彩照人。”当第三位演讲者说完这番话时，会众鼓掌欢呼道：“他赢了。”突然，一道火焰似的光芒，也就是婚姻之爱的光芒以其辉煌充满整个房间，同时以快乐充满他们的内心。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>384、之后第三个人发表了以下见解：</p><p>“爱和智慧都不是美的来源，爱与智慧的结合才是美的来源。因为少女并不是爱她自己的智慧而是爱小伙子的智慧，并因此而认为他是美的。当小伙子在姑娘身上看到这点时，他看到了她的美。所以，爱通过智慧而创造了美，智慧由于爱而接受它。”</p><p>“这在天国中是很明显的。我在天国中看到少女和妻子们并观察了她们的美。我见到少女有一种美，妻子有另一种美。在少女中只看到了美的光亮，而在妻子身上看到美的壮观。那区别就象是钻石的闪光和红宝石发的光一样。”</p><p>“美不就是看上去要让人高兴吗？而这种高兴的来源不就是爱和智慧的相互作用吗？这种相互作用使其发光，眼中射出的光体现着美。”</p><p>“不是脸上的红晕和珠般的光使得面容变得美丽吗？这种红晕不是来自于爱吗，珠般的光不是来自于智慧吗？因为爱因其火而产生了红光，智慧因其光而产生光。我在天国中的夫妇中清楚看到这点——一种红光与珠般的光相混而存在于妻子身上，珠般的光与红晕相混而存在于丈夫身上。我还发现他们彼此注视时会使光更强烈。”</p><p>第三个人讲完后，人群中响起掌声。“他是获胜者”，一道光即婚姻之爱的光充满了房间，同时也充满在人们欢快的心中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #384 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>384. After this a third speaker got up and spoke as follows. 'It is not love alone, nor wisdom alone, which is the source of beauty. It is the union of love and wisdom, the union of love with wisdom in the young man, and the union of wisdom with her love in the young woman. For a young woman does not love wisdom in herself, but in the young man; and this makes her see him as beautiful. When a young man sees this in a young woman, it makes him see her as beautiful. Love therefore by means of wisdom forms that beauty, and wisdom as the result of love receives it.<p>'I have had visual proof of the truth of this in heaven. I have there seen young women and wives, and observed their beauty, noticing that it was different in young women and in wives. In young women I saw only its sparkle, but in wives its splendour. The difference was like the bright sparkle of a diamond compared with the fiery flush of a ruby.<p>'Beauty is nothing but a delight to the eye; and where does this delight come from, but the play of love and wisdom? This play gives the sight a reddish colour, and this flashes from eye to eye and creates beauty. What is it that makes a face beautiful, if not its blush and its whiteness, and the charming way these combine? Surely its blush comes from love and its whiteness from wisdom. For love is red with its own fire, and wisdom is white with its own light. I have seen both of these plainly shown in the faces of a married couple in heaven, the blush of whiteness in the wife and the whiteness of blushing in the husband. I noticed that it was looking at each other which gave their faces such splendour.'<p>When the third speaker said this the gathering applauded, crying, 'This is the winner.' Suddenly a flame-like light, which is the light of conjugial love, filled the house with its splendour, and at the same time filled their hearts with pleasant feelings. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #384 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>384. After that the third speaker arose and spoke as follows:<p>"Love alone is not the origin of beauty, neither is wisdom alone, but the origin is a union of love and wisdom - a union of love with the wisdom in a youth, and a union of wisdom with its love in a maiden. For a maiden does not love wisdom in herself but in a young man, and on that account sees him as beautiful; and when the young man see this in a young woman, he then sees her as beautiful. Therefore love through wisdom creates beauty, and wisdom from love receives it.<p>"The fact of this is clearly apparent in heaven. I saw maidens and wives there, and observed their beauty; and I beheld one kind of beauty in the maidens and another altogether in the wives, seeing in the maidens only its sparkle, but in the wives its effulgence. I saw the difference as being like that between a diamond sparkling with light and a ruby refulgent at the same time with fire.<p>"What is beauty but something that gives delight to the sight? What is the origin of this delight but the interplay of love and wisdom? This interplay causes the sight to glow, and the glow radiates from eye to eye and presents beauty.<p>"What makes the beauty of a face but its ruddy glow and pearly radiance, and a lovely blending of the two? Is the ruddy glow not owing to love, and the pearly radiance to wisdom? For love glows with a ruddy glow from its fire, and wisdom shines with a pearly radiance from its light. I saw both qualities plainly in the faces of a married couple in heaven - a ruddy glow blended with a pearly radiance in the wife, and a pearly radiance blended with a ruddy glow in the husband. And I noticed that their looking at each other caused each to become brighter."<p>When the third speaker said this, the crowd applauded and cried out, "He is the winner!" And suddenly a flaming light - which is the light of conjugial love also - filled the house with a radiant splendor, and at the same time their hearts with gladness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #384 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>384. After this the third one stepped up and expressed these ideas.<p>"The source of beauty is not love by itself or wisdom by itself, but it is a combination of love and wisdom - a union of love and wisdom in the young man and a union of wisdom with the love of it in the young woman. For a young woman does not love wisdom in itself but in a young man, and for that reason she sees him as beauty. And when a young man sees this in a young woman, he sees her as beauty. So love forms beauty through wisdom, and wisdom receives it through love.<p>"It is strikingly clear in heaven that this is so. I saw virgins and wives there, and I studied their beauty, and I saw it was totally different in virgins than in wives. There was just the glow of it in virgins, but in wives there was the brilliance of it. I saw a difference like a diamond sparkling with light and a ruby also flashing fire.<p>"What is beauty but a joy to your eyesight? Where is the source of this delight but in the play of love and wisdom? From this play your eyesight glows, and the glow glitters from eye to eye and gives forth beauty. What makes the beauty of a face except red and white in a lovely blend? Isn't the red from love and the white from wisdom? For love is red from its fire, and wisdom is white from its light. I saw clearly that these two colors are in the faces of two married partners in heaven - the red of the white in the wife and the white of the red in the husband. And I observed that they beamed on looking at each other."<p>When the third had said these things, the crowd applauded and shouted, "This is the winner." And at once a flaming light that is also the light of married love filled the house with brightness, and at the same time filled their hearts with delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #384 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>384. After him arose the third orator, and he spoke out as follows: Not love alone, nor wisdom alone, is the origin of beauty, but the union of love and wisdom--the union of love with wisdom in the young man, and the union of wisdom with its love in the maiden; for a maiden does not love wisdom in herself but in a young man, it being from this that she sees him as beauty; and when a young man sees this in the maiden, he sees her as beauty. Therefore, love by wisdom forms beauty, and Wisdom from love receives it. That such is the case is manifestly apparent in heaven. There I saw maidens and wives, and, paying attention to their beauty, I observed that in maidens it was altogether different than in wives, being, in maidens, the gleaming of beauty, but in wives its splendor. I saw the distinction as the distinction between a diamond sparkling from light, and a ruby flashing at the same time from fire. What is beauty but a delight of the sight? Whence is the origin of this delight but from the sport of love and wisdom? From this sport the sight glows red, and this glowing vibrates from eye to eye and displays beauty. What makes the beauty of a face but red and white and their lovely blending with each other? Is not the red from love and the white from wisdom? for love glows red from its fire, and wisdom becomes white from its light. These two I have plainly seen in the faces of two married partners in heaven, the red of the bright white in the wife, and the bright whiteness of the red in the husband; and I observed that when looking at each other, they glowed with splendor."<p>When the third orator had thus spoken, the assemblage applauded and cried out, "He has won." And suddenly a flamy light, Which is also the light of conjugial love, then filled the house with splendor and at the same time their hearts with delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #384 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>384. After him the third arose and spoke as follows: "Neither love alone nor wisdom alone is beauty's source, but the union of love and wisdom - of love with wisdom in the young man, and of wisdom with its love in the young woman. For a maid loves wisdom not in herself but in a young man and so finds him beautiful; and when the young man sees this in a maiden he finds her beautiful. Therefore love by wisdom forms beauty, and wisdom from love receives it. The truth of this appears manifestly in heaven. I saw maidens and wives there and studied their beauty, and I observed one kind of beauty with virgins and another kind altogether with wives. With virgins it was only a brilliant beauty, but with wives a radiant beauty. I saw a difference like that between a diamond sparkling with light and a ruby glowing at the same time with fire. What is beauty but pleasure of sight? What source has this pleasure but the interplay of love and wisdom? The sight glows from this play, and the glowing vibrates from eye to eye, and gives beauty. What makes the beauty of a face but red and bright white and their lovely blending? Is not the red from love and the bright white from wisdom? For love blushes from its own fire, and wisdom is white with its own light. These two I have seen plainly in the faces of married partners in heaven, the rosiness of bright white in the wife, and the whiteness of red in the husband; and I noticed that the colors glowed as the partners regarded each other."<p>When the third had concluded, the company broke into applause and cried, "He has won." At once a flamy light, which is also the light of marital love, filled the building with splendor and their hearts at the same time with pleasure. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #384 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>384. After him the third arose and delivered these words: 'It is not love alone, nor is it wisdom alone, which is the origin of beauty, but the union of love and wisdom in the young man, and the union of wisdom with its love in the maiden. For a maid does not love wisdom in herself, but in a young man, and hence sees him as beauty; and when the young man sees this in a maiden he sees her as beauty, and therefore, love by wisdom forms beauty, and wisdom from love receives it. That this is so manifestly appears in heaven. I saw maidens and wives there and considered their beauty, and I observed that it was of one kind with virgins and altogether of another kind with wives. With virgins it was only the sheen of beauty but with wives its effulgence. The difference I saw was as a diamond sparkling with light, and a ruby glowing at the same time from fire. What is beauty but delight of seeing? Whence the origin of this delight but from the play of love and wisdom? From this play the sight glows, and this glowing vibrates from eye to eye and displays beauty. What makes the beauty of a face but red and bright white, and their lovely blending into each other? Is not the red from love and the bright white from wisdom? For love blushes from its own fire, and wisdom is bright white from its own light. These two I have plainly seen in the faces of two married partners in heaven, the rosiness of bright white in the wife, and the bright whiteness of red in the husband; and I observed that they beamed from looking at each other.'<p>When the third had said this the assemblage applauded and exclaimed, 'He has won.' And immediately a flamy light, which is also the light of conjugial love, filled the house with splendor and their hearts, at the same time with pleasantness. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #384 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>384. Post hunc surrexit Tertius, et eloquutus haec; "non est solus Amor, nec est sola Sapientia, Origo pulchritudinis, sed est Unio amoris et sapientiae, unio amoris cum sapientia in juvene, ac unio sapientiae cum suo amore in virgine; virgo enim non amat sapientiam in se sed in juvene, et inde videt illum ut pulchritudinem, et cum juvenis hoc videt in virgine, tunc videt illam ut pulchritudinem; quare amor per sapientiam format illam, ac sapientia ex amore recipit illam: quod ita sit, manifeste apparet in Coelo; vidi ibi virgines et uxores, et attendi ad pulchritudines, et vidi prorsus aliam in virginibus, et aliam in uxoribus, in virginibus solum nitorem ejus, in uxoribus autem splendorem ejus; discrimen vidi sicut adamantem ex luce micantem, et sicut rubinum simul ex igne fulgurantem: quid Pulchritudo nisi delitium visus; unde Origo hujus delitii, nisi ex Ludo amoris et sapientiae; ex hoc ludo rutilat visus, et hoc rutilum ex oculo in oculum se vibrat, et sistit pulchritudinem. Quid facit pulchritudinem faciei, nisi rubor et candor, et horum amabilis mixtura inter se; estne rubor ex amore, et candor ex sapientia; amor enim rubet ex suo igne, et sapientia candet ex sua luce; haec duo in faciebus duorum conjugum in Coelo manifeste vidi, ruborem candoris in uxore, et candorem ruboris in marito; et animadverti, quod ex mutuo intuitu exsplenduerint." Cum Tertius haec loquutus est, adplausit Caetus, et clamavit, "hic vicit:" et subito lux flammea, quae etiam est lux amoris conjugialis, implevit domum splendore, et simul corda illorum amaenitate. </p>
