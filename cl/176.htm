<h4 align="center"></h4><p>176、⒄这些职责还随着他们互相帮助而将这二人联结为一体，同时构成一个家庭。世上众所周知的事之一是：丈夫的职责以某种方式与妻子的职责联结，妻子的职责则与丈夫的职责关联；这些联结和关联通过他们相互帮助而实现，并取决于他们的相互帮助。但主要职责，就是将夫妻二人的灵魂和生命绑定、联系并合而为一的职责，是联合抚养孩子。在这方面，丈夫和妻子的职责既各不相同，同时又联在一起。它们之所以不同，是因为负责哺育、教育婴幼儿（无论男女），以及教导女孩子，直到她们到了谈婚论嫁的年龄，被交到丈夫手里为止，是适合妻子的职责；而负责教导男孩子，从童年到青春期，再由此直到他们独立自主，是适合丈夫的职责。不过，这些职责通过夫妻二人给予彼此的建议、支持，以及其它许多种帮助而联在一起。众所周知，这些职责将夫妻二人的心连为一体，无论是联在一起的职责，还是性质不同的职责，或无论是夫妻共同承担的职责，还是各自承担的职责，并且被称为舐犊之情（即父母对其后代的属世情感）的爱也具有这种效果。人们还知道，就其差异和结合而言，这些职责构成一个家庭。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>176、（17）这些职责也使得丈夫和妻子合二为一，同时构成一个家，双方彼此依赖来维持家庭。我们知道丈夫的职责在某些方面是与妻子的职责相联的，同妻子维护家庭。同时妻子的职责也与丈夫的职责相连，这种联系就是他们给对方的帮助。</p><p>但是最主要的使双方合二为一的职责是他们共同养育子女的职责。在这一职责中丈夫与妻子的任务不同，但同时又是相互联系的。哺育男孩直到他们能够独立，教育女孩直到她结婚时止的职责是属于妻子的，教育男孩直到他们能够独立的职责是属于丈夫的。然而，这些职责又在教育支持儿女等许多方面相互联系。</p><p>人们知道这些职责使得夫妻双方的心合二为一，这其中彼此不同的职责，共同的职责都是来自于父母双方对子女的爱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #176 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>176. (xvii) These duties also link the two into one as they help each other; and together they make a single household.<p>It is one of the things well known in the world that the husband's duties are in some way linked to those of the wife, and the wife's duties are associated with the husband's, these links and associations being effected and determined by their mutual help. But the primary duty, which binds, associates and brings together into one the souls and lives of the married couple is seeing jointly to the bringing up of children. In dealing with this the duties of husband and wife are at once different but linked. They are different in that seeing to the feeding of babies and the bringing up of children of either sex, and teaching girls up to the age at which they are given in marriage and transferred to the company of husbands, is the proper duty of the wife. But seeing to the education of boys between infancy and adolescence, and beyond this until they become independent, is the proper duty of the husband.<p>These duties are linked by the advice, support and many other forms of help rendered by one to the other. It is well known that both these sets of duties, both those which are linked and those which are different, both those which are shared and those which are special, bind the dispositions of a couple into one, the result of the action of what is called parental love. It is also well known that these duties as regards their difference and their linking make a single household. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #176 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>176. 17. These duties also join the two into one, and at the same time make a single household, depending on the assistance they render each other. One of the things people know in the world is that a husband's duties are in some way joined together with the duties of his wife, and that a wife's duties are connected to the duties of her husband, and that these conjunctions and connections are the assistance they give each other and depend on that assistance.<p>But the primary duties which confederate, affiliate, and bring the souls and lives of two married partners together into one are those which involve their joint concern in bringing up children. In this concern a husband's duties and a wife's duties differ and at the same time are joined together. They differ, because the responsibility of suckling and bringing up little children of both sexes, and also of educating girls to the age when they are handed over to the custody of men and associate with them - this is a responsibility having to do with the distinctive duty of a wife. On the other hand, the responsibility of educating boys after early childhood to the time of adolescence, and after that until they become independent - this is a responsibility having to do with the distinctive duty of a husband. Nevertheless, these duties are joined together through the counsel, support, and many other kinds of assistance that the two partners give each other.<p>People know that these duties bind the hearts of two partners together into one - both those duties which are joined together and those which are different in nature, or those which are mutual duties and those which are distinctive ones - and that this is owing to the love called storge <sup >1</sup>(the natural affection of parents for their offspring). People also know that these duties, viewed in respect to their difference and conjunction, make a single household.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;From the Greek storg, pronounced stor'gee (like psyche), in use in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries to mean natural or instinctive affection, usually that of parents for their offspring, but no longer current. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #176 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>176. 17. These activities, when done to help each other, also join the two together into one and make a unified home as well. In some respects a husband's activities join together with a wife's and a wife's attach to her husband's, and these connections and attachments are a mutual help and happen according to mutual help.<p>These are things the world knows. But the main thing that allies the souls and lives of two partners, makes them share, and brings them together, is their mutual concern for educating children. On this ground the husband's activities and the wife's activities are different, and at the same time they fit together. They differ because a wife's particular job is taking care of the breast - feeding and rearing of babies of either sex and also the instruction of girls up to the age of consent and the company of men. But a husband's particular job is seeing to the instruction of boys, after childhood up to puberty, and after that until they are in charge of themselves.<p>Yet these activities mesh through consulting and supporting one another and helping each other in many other ways.<p>It is well known that these activities - as united as they are different, or as much in common as they are individual - bring the partners' souls together into one, and that the love called parental love is what makes it happen. It is also well known that these activities, keeping their difference and their cooperation in view, make a united home. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #176 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>176. XVII. THAT ACCORDING AS THERE IS MUTUAL AID, THESE OFFICES ALSO CONJOIN THE TWO INTO A ONE, AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKE ONE HOME. That in some affairs, the offices of the husband conjoin themselves with the offices of the wife, and the offices of the wife adjoin themselves to the offices of the husband; also that these conjunctions and adjunctions are a mutual aid and are effected according to that aid--this is among things well known in the world. But the main office which confederates and consociates the souls and lives of two partners, and gathers them into a one, is their common concern in the education of their children. In this the offices of the husband and those of the wife are distinct, and at the same time conjoint. They are distinct because the charge of suckling and educating the infants of both sexes, and also the instruction of girls up to the age when they may be addressed by men and associate with them, is an office proper to the wife, while the charge of the instruction of boys from childhood to puberty and from then until they become their own masters, is an office proper to the husband. But these offices become conjoint by consultations and mutual support and by much else which is of mutual assistance. That these offices, both the joint and the distinct, or those that are common to both partners and those that are individual, bind the animi of the partners together into a one, and that the love called storge also has this effect is well known. It is also well known that these offices, regarded in their separation and in their conjunction, make one home. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #176 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>176. (xvii) In mutual helpfulness these activities also conjoin the two into one; at the same time they make the home one. It is among things known in the world that the husband's activities are conjoined in some degree with the wife's, and the wife's are adjoined to the husband's, and that these conjunctions and adjunctions are a mutual help and are according to mutual helpfulness. Chief among the activities which league and ally and gather into one the souls and lives of the two partners is the common care of educating the children. In this care the husband's and the wife's activities at once diverge and merge. They diverge because the care in nourishment and education of the infants of both sexes and also for the instruction of the girls until they are old enough to be presented to and associate with men belongs to the wife's proper activity; but the care of the instruction of the boys, from childhood to puberty, and after that until they are their own masters, belongs to the husband's peculiar duty. The activities merge through counsels, mutual support and much other mutual assistance. It is known that these activities, the separate as well as the united, bring the partners' minds together, and that the love called storge does so especially. It is also known that these activities, whether pursued by the two severally or together, make one home. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #176 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>176. (17) That these duties also, according to mutual aid, conjoin the two into one; and at the same time make one house. That the duties of the husband in some way conjoin themselves with the duties of the wife, and that the duties of the wife adjoin themselves to the duties of the husband, and that these conjunctions and adjunctions are a mutual help, and are according to mutual help, are among the things known in the world. But the primary things which confederate, consociate, and gather the souls and lives of two married partners into one, are the common care of the education of children, in relation to which the duties of the husband and the duties of the wife are distinct, and at the same time conjoin themselves. They are distinct, in that the care of suckling and the education of infants of both sexes, and also of the instruction of girls up to the age when they may become marriageable and associate with men, is a duty peculiar to the wife. But the care of the instruction of boys, after childhood up to puberty, and from that until they become their own master, is a duty proper to the husband. But these duties conjoin themselves, by counsels and support, and many other mutual helps. That these duties - both those that are conjoined and those that are distinct, or the common as well as the peculiar - draw the minds of married partners together into one, and that the love called storge effects this, is known. It is also known that regarded as to their distinctness and their conjunction these duties make one house. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #176 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>176. XVII. Quod Officia illa secundum mutuum auxilium etiam conjungant duos in unum; et simul faciant unam domum. Quod Mariti officia aliqua ratione se conjungant cum officiis uxoris, et quod officia Uxoris se adjungant officiis mariti, et quod conjunctiones et adjunctiones illae sint mutuum auxilium, et secundum illud, inter nota in Mundo sunt; at Primaria quae confoederant, consociant, et in unum congregant animas et vitas duorum conjugum, est communis cura educandi liberos; circa quam Officia mariti et Officia uxoris se distinguunt <sup>1</sup>et simul conjungunt; se distinguunt, <sup>2</sup>quia cura lactationis et educationis infantum utriusque sexus, et quoque instructionis puellarum usque ad aetatem illarum dum addicantur et associantur viris, est proprii officii uxoris; at cura instructionis puerorum, post pueritiam ad ephebatum, et post illum usque dum suae potestatis fiunt, est proprii officii mariti; conjungunt autem se per consilia, et sustentationes, et per plura alia auxilia mutua. Quod Officia illa tam conjuncta quam distincta, seu tam communia quam propria, colligent animos conjugum in unum, et quod Amor storge vocatus id efficiat, notum est: quod Officia illa in sua distinctione et conjunctione spectata, faciant unam Domum, etiam notum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: distingvunt<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: distingvunt, </p>
