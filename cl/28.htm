<h4 align="center"></h4><p>28、⑴人死后依然是活生生的人。鉴于上述原因，人们至今不知道人死后依然是活生生的人。令人惊讶的是，基督教界竟然也不知道。尽管他们拥有圣言，并从圣言拥有关于永生的启示，因为主在圣言中亲自教导说：<br><br>死人都要复活，神不是死人的神，乃是活人的神。（马太福音22：31，32，路加福音20：37，38）<br><br>此外，就心智的情感和思维而言，人实际上在天使和灵人之间，并与他们联结得如此紧密，以致若不死亡，就无法切断与他们的联系。更令人惊讶的是，人们不知道，自创世以来凡死去的人都已经并正在归到自己人那里，如圣言所说，他已经并正在同他们一同聚集。另外，人们都有一种普遍感觉，就是天堂流入其心智的内层，促使他们对真理有一种内在感知，可以说能看到它们，尤其是这一真理：人死后依然是活生生的人，并且，若在世时生活良善，就是幸福的，若生活邪恶，则是不幸的。当他们发自内心敬拜神，或在床上奄奄一息，濒临死亡，或获悉死者及其命运的状况时，若将心智稍稍提升至身体和接近感官的思维之上，谁不会这样想？我讲述过上千件有关死者的事，如，某些人的兄弟、配偶和朋友的命运，还写过英国人、荷兰人、天主教徒、犹太人和异教徒，以及马丁路德，加尔文和墨兰顿的命运，从未听到有人说：“这怎会是他们的命运，因为最后的审判尚未到来，他们还没从坟墓中复活呢！在此期间，他们不就是灵魂吗？而灵魂不就是一缕气，位于地狱边缘或其它地方吗？”我还没听到过这样的话。由此我断定，人皆有这样的内在感知：人死后依然是活生生的人。当人所深爱的伴侣、婴儿和小孩行将死亡，或已经死亡时，若其思维升至身体感官之上，谁不会发自内心说，他们在神手里，等自己死后还会见到他们，并与他们再度分享爱和欢乐的生活？</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>28、（1）人死后在另一个世界中还是做为人而存在。</p><p>因为上述的原因，直到现在人们才知道人死后在另一个世界中还是做为人而存在。令人吃惊的是，基督教界也不晓得这一点。这些人们拥有圣经对永恒的生命的启示。主这样告诉我们，死人会复活，神不是死人的神而是活人的神。（马太福音23:31-32，路加福音20:37-38）</p><p>另外，从人的情感思想方面讲，处于天使和精灵间的人们与从前的情感密切相联，不经过死亡，人无法与天使及精灵相交流。更令人吃惊的是，尽管从创世时起，人们就与死亡相联。人们却不知道，死去以后，人还是他自己，或者像圣经所说的，归到列祖那去了。</p><p>另外，人们有一种普遍的体会（也就是关于天堂的感知可以被人的头脑所接受）这种体会使得人们从内心深处接受真理，尤其是死后还做为人而存在这一真理。对于没有这种体会的人，只要他稍稍超越感官而进行思考，这会有这种体会，此时他处于一种内在的信仰状态中。人在病床上等待生命的尽头的时候也会有这种体会。或是当他们听到关于死去的人们及他们的状况时，也会有这种感觉。</p><p>我已经讲了关于死去的人们的好多情况，例如，关于某个人死去的兄弟，伴侣及朋友的情况。我还描写过英国人、荷兰人、罗马天主教徒、犹太人及非犹太人的情况，还有关于路德、卡尔文及 梅兰西顿的情况。我从没听有人问“最后的审判还没到来，他们还没有从坟墓中醒来，怎么会有关于他们的境况呢？”他们不是处于边缘地带的像气息一样的灵魂吗？”</p><p>我从来没听到有人这样说过。由此，我推断人们内心中认为人死后还是像人一样生活着。</p><p>若一个人能脱离感官而思考的话，那么，在他的伴侣或孩子处于死亡边缘，或失去他们时，他会知道，他们现在在神的掌护之中，在他死后，他会再见到他们，并与他们一起生活在快乐与爱之中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #28 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>28. (i) A person lives on as a person after death.<p>It has not so far been known that a person lives on as a person after death for the reasons which have just been mentioned. It is surprising that this is even true in Christendom, where the Word is known to give enlightenment about everlasting life, and where the Lord Himself teaches that all the dead rise again, and God is not the God of the dead, but of the living (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_31.htm">Matthew 22:31-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>). Moreover, as far as the affections and thoughts of a person's mind are concerned, he is in the company of angels and spirits, and so closely associated with them that he cannot be torn away from them except by dying. This ignorance is all the more surprising, when everyone who has died from the beginning of creation has come or is coming to his own people, or, as the Word has it, he has been or is being gathered to them.<p>In addition, people have a general impression, which is none other than the influence of heaven on the inner levels of the mind, which causes him to have an inward perception of truths, and so to speak to see them. This allows him to grasp this truth in particular, that a person continues to live as a person after death, happily if he has led a good life, unhappily if not. Surely everyone has this thought, if he lifts his mind a little above the body and thinks beyond the immediate level of the senses, as happens when he is deep in the worship of God, or when he lies on his death-bed awaiting his last breath, and similarly when he hears people speaking about the departed and their fate.<p>I have related thousands of facts about the departed, telling their brothers, wives and friends the fate of some of them. I have also written about the fate of the British, the Dutch, the Roman Catholics, the Jews, and the heathen, and about the fate of Luther, Calvin and Melanchthon. But up to the present I have never heard anyone remark, 'How can that be their fate, when they have not yet been resurrected from their graves, since the Last Judgment has not yet taken place? Surely they are in the meantime souls, mere puffs of wind, in some limbo called Pu <sup >1</sup>?' I have never heard anyone say such things, and this has allowed me to draw the conclusion that each person has a private perception that he lives on as such after death. Does not any husband who loves his wife, his young or older children, say to himself when they are dying or dead, that they are in God's hands, and he will see them again after his own death, and he will again share with them a life of love and joy? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #28 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>28. 1. A person lives as a person after death. It has not been known in the world till now that a person lives as a person after death, for the reasons just mentioned above. And what is remarkable, it has not been known even in the Christian world, where people have the Word and therefore enlightenment regarding eternal life on account of the Word, in which the Lord Himself teaches that the dead all rise again, and that God is not God of the dead, but of the living (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_31.htm">Matthew 22:31-32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>).<p>Moreover, in respect to the affections and thoughts of his mind a person is in the midst of angels and spirits and is so associated with them that he could not be severed from them without dying. It is still more remarkable that this, too, is not known, even though every person who has died from the beginning of creation, after death has gone and continues to go to his own, or, as the Word says, has been gathered and is gathered to his people. <sup >1</sup><p>In addition, people also have a general perception (which is the same thing as saying an influx of heaven into the inner faculties of their minds), which causes them to perceive truths inwardly in themselves and, in a way, to see them, and especially this truth, that one lives as a person after death, happily if he has lived well, and unhappily if he has lived ill. For who does not have this thought when he elevates his mind a little from the body and from the thinking nearest his senses, as happens when he is inwardly in a state of Divine worship, or when he lies dying in his bed and is awaiting the end. Likewise when he is told about the deceased and their lot.<p>I have reported thousands of things about the dead, as for example, what the lot of certain people's brothers, married partners, and friends was like. I have written as well about the lot of Englishmen, Dutchmen, Roman Catholics, Jews, and gentiles, and also about the lot of Luther, Calvin and Melanchthon. And I have never yet heard anyone say, "How can that be their lot when they have not yet risen from their graves, seeing that the Last Judgment has not yet taken place! Are they not in the meantime souls that are bits of breath, existing in some limbo or other?"<p>I have heard no one say anything like that yet. And from this I have been able to conclude that everyone has an inner perception that one lives as a person after death.<p>What man who has loved his married partner and his infants and children, does not say to himself when they are dying or dead, if he is in a state of thought raised above the sensory things of the body, that they are in the hand of God, and that following his own death he will see them again and join with them once more in a life of love and joy?<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_25_8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_25_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_35_29.htm">35:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_29.htm">49:29</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_33.htm">33</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_20_24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_20_26.htm">26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_27_13.htm">27:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_2.htm">31:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_50.htm">Deuteronomy 32:50</a>; also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_15.htm">Genesis 15:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_2_10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_22_20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-chronicles_34_28.htm">2 Chronicles 34:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_13_36.htm">Acts 13:36</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #28 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>28. 1. A person lives on - still a person - after death. For the reasons given just above, the world has not known until now that people live on as people after death. This is surprising, especially in the Christian world, which has the Word, and therefore enlightenment about eternal life, and in which the Lord Himself taught that all of the dead revive and that "God is not God of the dead but of the living" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_30.htm">Matthew 22:30-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>).<p>Moreover, as to mental feelings and thoughts, people are among the angels and spirits and in their company in such a way that people cannot be separated from the angels and spirits without dying.<p>And it is even more surprising that this is unknown, when for all that, every person who has ever died since the first creation has come, and comes, to his own people, or as it says in the Word, has been gathered and is gathered.<p>And moreover, people share a general perception that coincides with the influence of heaven on their innermost minds. By this perception they sense truths within themselves and see them, so to speak, and especially this truth - that they live on as people after death, happy if they lived well and unhappy if they lived badly. Indeed, who does not feel this when he raises his mind a little above his body and away from the thoughts nearest his physical senses - which he does when deep in Divine worship and when he lies on his deathbed and waits for the end?<p>It is the same when he hears about the dead and what happens to them. I have reported a thousand things about them, such as what became of people's brothers, wives, and friends. I have also written about what happens to the English, Dutch, Catholics, Jews, and non - Christians, and what became of Luther, Calvin, and Melanchthon. And so far I have never heard anyone say, "How could these things happen to them, when they have not yet risen from their graves, because the Last Judgment hasn't happened yet? Aren't they souls in the meantime, which are breaths? And aren't they in some waiting place or other?" I still have never heard anyone say anything like that, which leads me to conclude that everyone senses within himself that he lives on as a person after death.<p>What man who has loved his wife and his babies and children does not tell himself that they are in God's hand when they are dying or have died, if his thought rises above his physical senses while considering it? And doesn't he think he will see them again after his death and join them again in a life of love and joy? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #28 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>28. I. THAT MAN LIVES AS A MAN AFTER DEATH. That man lives as a man after death has been hitherto unknown in the world for the reasons given just above; and, what is remarkable, it is unknown even in the Christian world where is the Word, and from it enlightenment respecting eternal life, and where the Lord himself teaches that all the dead rise again, and that God is not the God of the dead but of the living (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_31.htm">Matthew 22:31-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>). Moreover, as to the affections and thoughts of his mind, man is in the midst of angels and spirits, and is so consociated with them that if torn away from them he would die. That it is unknown is still more remarkable, when yet, after his decease, every man who has died from first creation, has come and does come or, as it is said in the Word, has been gathered and is gathered to his own. Besides this, man has common perception, and this is one with that influx from heaven into the interiors of his mind from which, inwardly in himself, he perceives truths and sees them, as it were; and especially this truth, that he lives as a man after death, happy if he has lived well, unhappy if he has lived ill; for who does not think this, when he elevates his mind a little above the body and above the thought next to his senses? as is the case when he is inwardly in Divine worship, and when he lies upon his bed about to die and awaits the end; likewise when he hears about the deceased and their lot. I have related a thousand things about them, such as, what was the lot of the brothers of certain persons, of their married partners and friends; I have also written about the lot of Englishmen, Dutchmen, Papists, Jews, Gentiles, and also about the lot of Luther, Calvin, and Melancthon; and as yet I have never heard any one say: "How can their lot be such when they have not yet risen from their graves, seeing that the Last Judgment has not yet taken place? are they not in the meantime souls, which are breaths? and in some Pu or Ubi?" <sup >1</sup>By no one have I yet heard such things said; and from this, I can conclude that every one perceives within himself that he lives as a man after death. What man who has loved his wife and his infants and children, if in thought he is elevated above the sensual things of the body, does not say within himself when they are dying or have died, that they are in God's hand, and that he will see them again after his own death, and will again be conjoined with them in a life of love and joy!<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Pu and Ubi are respectively the Greek and Latin words meaning "Somewhere." They were formerly used as theological terms to designate the abode of souls while waiting for reunion with their bodies. Such souls were also said to be "in limbo" (in the border land). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #28 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>28. (i) The human being lives as such after death. For reasons given above, the world has been ignorant of this fact. Strange to say, even Christendom has not known that the human being lives as such after death, though it has the Word and enlightenment from it about eternal life, and though it has the Lord's own teaching that<p>All the dead rise again, and that God is God not of the dead, but of the living (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_31.htm">Matthew 22:31-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>).<p>As to affection and thought, moreover, every man is in the midst of angels and spirits, and is so associated with them that he cannot be parted from them without dying. The general ignorance is the more strange in that every person who has died since the first creation, has passed at death, or as the Word says, has been "gathered," to his people. There is also a common perception (which is an influx of heaven into the interior of the mind) by virtue of which the human being perceives and sees truths as it were inwardly in himself, and in particular the truth that he lives as a human being after death, happy if he has lived well, and unhappy if he has lived ill. What man does not think so, if his mind is raised at all above the body and above the thought nearest the body's senses, as it is in inward Divine worship or when he lies dying and awaiting the end? We think so, too, when we hear about the dead and their lot. I have reported thousands of things about the dead, telling people how their brothers, married partners or friends fared; I have written of the lot after death of the English and the Dutch, of Papists, Jews and Gentiles, and also of the lot of Luther, Calvin and Melancthon; but I have never yet heard any one object, "How can their lot be as you say when they have not yet arisen from their graves, inasmuch as the Last Judgment has not yet been effected? Are they not souls, like breaths, and in an undefined somewhere?" I have never heard such objections made, and can conclude that we perceive in ourselves that we live as human beings after death. What man, who has loved his partner, and his babies and children, does not assure himself, when they die, at least if his thought rises above the sensuous things of the body, that his loved ones are in God's hands, and that, after his own death, he will see them again and rejoin them in a life of love and joy? </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #28 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>28. (1) That man lives as a man after death. It has hitherto been unknown in the world that man lives as a man after death, for the reasons just given above, and what is extraordinary is that it should be so even in the Christian world, where the Word is, and illustration therefrom respecting eternal life; and wherein the Lord Himself teaches that:<p>All the dead are raised, and that God is not the God of the dead but of the living (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_31.htm">Matthew 22:31-32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>).<p>And besides, as to the affections and the thoughts of his mind man is in the midst of angels and spirits, and is so consociated with them that if torn apart from them he would die. And it is still more extraordinary that this is unknown when it is considered that every man who has died, from the first creation, has come and comes to his own, or as it is said in the Word has been gathered and is gathered unto his fathers. <sup >1</sup>Moreover, man has a common perception, which is the same with the influx from heaven into the interiors of his mind, whereby he perceives truths interiorly in himself, and as it were sees them; and especially this truth, that he lives as a man after death, happy if he has lived well, unhappy if ill. For who does not think this, whilst he raises his mind a little above the body, and away from the thought that is nearest to his senses? which he does when inwardly he is in Divine worship, and when he lies upon the bed about to die and expects the end; likewise when he hears about the dead, and of their lot. I have related a thousand things about them, as, what was the condition of the brothers, consorts, and friends of some; and I have also written about the lot of the English, the Dutch, the Papists, the Jews, the Gentiles, and also of the lot of Luther, of Calvin, and Melanchthon; and as yet I have never heard anyone say: 'How can their lot be such when they have not yet risen out of their sepulchers, for the last judgment has not yet taken place? Are they not in the meantime souls, which are breaths of air? and in a certain Pu? or somewhere?' By no one have I heard such things said, up to this time. Whence I may conclude that everyone perceives within himself that he lives as a man after death. What man who has loved his wife, and his infants and children, does not say within himself when they are dying, or have died, if in thought he is elevated above the sensual things of the body, that they are in God's hand, and he will see them again after his own death, and will be conjoined with them again in a life of love and joy?<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Judges 2:10; 2 Kings 22:20; etc. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #28 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>28. I: Quod homo vivat homo post mortem. Quod homo vivat homo post mortem, hactenus in Mundo nescitum est, ex causis, de quibus mox supra; et quod mirabile est, etiam in Christiano Orbe, ubi est Verbum, et inde illustratio de Vita aeterna, et ubi Ipse Dominus docet, quod Omnes mortui resurgant, et quod Deus non sit mortuorum sed viventium Deus, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_28/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_22_30" target=_top>Matth. 22:30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_28/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_22_31" target=_top>31</a>. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_28/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_20_37-38" target=_top>Luc. 20:37-38</a>. Ac insuper homo quoad mentis suae affectiones et cogitationes est in medio angelorum et spirituum, ac illis ita consociatus, ut non possit divelli ab illis nisi moriatur. Et adhuc mirabilius est, quod hoc nesciatur, cum tamen omnis homo, qui a prima Creatione obierat, post obitum ad suos venerat ac venit, seu ut in Verbo dicitur, collectus est et colligitur: et praeterea homini est communis perceptio, quae eadem est cum influxu Coeli in interiora mentis ejus, ex quo intus in se percipit vera, et sicut videt illa, et imprimis hoc verum, quod vivat homo post mortem, felix si bene vixit, et infelix si male; quis enim hoc non cogitat, dum parum elevat mentem a corpore, et a cogitatione proxima ejus sensibus, quod fit dum interius in Cultu Divino est, et dum jacet in lecto moribundus et exspectat extremum; similiter dum audit de defunctis, et de illorum sorte; narravi millia de illis, ut in quali sorte essent quorundam fratres, conjuges, et amici; et quoque scripsi de sorte Anglorum, Hollandorum, Pontificiorum, Judaeorum, Gentium, et quoque de sorte Lutheri, Calvini et Melanchtonis; et adhuc nusquam audivi aliquem dicentem, "quomodo potest talis sors illis esse, cum tamen nondum e sepulchris suis resurrexerunt, nondum enim est Ultimum Judicium peractum; suntne illi interea animae quae sunt pneumata, et in quodam pu seu ubi;" talia adhuc a nemine audivi dicta; ex quo potui concludere, quod unusquisque in se percipiat, quod vivat homo post mortem. Quis vir qui amavit conjugem, ac suos infantes et liberos, dum moriuntur aut mortui sunt, non secum dicat, si in cogitatione elevata supra sensualia corporis est, quod sint in manu Dei, quodque illos post suam mortem iterum visurus sit, ac vitam amoris et gaudii cum illis iterum conjuncturus. </p>
