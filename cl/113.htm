<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第113节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>113、这宫殿中有一道长方形的屏风设在门前，几个非洲陌生人站在它后面。他们向这些欧洲土著人招呼说：“请允许我们当中的一位就婚姻之爱及其活力或性能力的源头也发表一下意见。”桌旁的所有人都以手示意表示允许。于是，其中一个人进来，站在放有头冠的桌旁，说：“你们基督徒从爱情本身来追溯婚姻之爱的源头，而我们非洲人从天地之神来追溯它。婚姻之爱难道不是一种贞洁、纯粹和神圣的爱吗？天上的天使不就享有这爱吗？整个人类、因而整个天使天堂不都是这爱的种吗？如此无与伦比的奇迹岂能来自其它源头，而不来自神自己，宇宙的创造者和维护者？你们基督徒从各种理性和属世的因素来追溯婚姻的活力或性能力，而我们非洲人则从人与宇宙之神结合的状态来追溯；我们把这种状态叫作宗教状态，而你们却称之为教会状态。因为当爱出自这一源头，并稳定恒久时，它必使其类似于自己的活力也稳定恒久。除了靠近神的极少数人外，没有人知道真正的婚姻之爱。因此，这爱的性能力也不为他人所知；而天上的天使却将伴随这爱的性能力描述为永恒春天的快乐。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>113、在宫殿的门前有一道长方形的屏帐，屏帐后面站着一些来自于非洲的人，他们请求来阐述一下他们对婚姻之爱及其力量的观点。</p><p>在座的一致同意后。</p><p>他们中的一个走进来，站在放贵冠的桌前，说道：</p><p>“你们基督徒们从婚姻之爱本身来探索它的来源，我们非洲人是从神那里来考虑它的来源。”</p><p>“婚姻之爱不是一种贞洁，神圣的爱吗？天国中的天使们不是拥有这种爱吗？整个人类及天国不就是来自于这种爱吗？这么美好的事物如果不是来自于神还会来自于哪呢？”</p><p>“你们基督徒从各种理性的及自然的角度探索婚姻之爱的力量，我们非洲人则考虑一个人与宇宙中的神的结合。（我们中这种结合是一个人的宗教性，你们称其为一个人的教会性）。我们认为爱是来自于与神的结合，它是持续不断的，它自然有不断的力量。” </p><p>“只有靠近神的少数人才知道真正的婚姻之爱及其力量，天国中的天使称伴随着这种爱的力量象是一个不断的快乐之泉。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #113 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>113. Behind a long partition placed in front of the doors in the palace there stood some strangers from Africa, who cried out to the Europeans: 'Allow one of us too to offer his opinion on the source of conjugial love, and of its strength or potency.' At all the tables hands were raised to give permission.<p>Then one of them came right in and stood by the table on which the headdress was placed. 'You Christians,' he said, 'trace the source of conjugial love to the love itself; but we Africans trace it to the God of heaven and earth. Is not conjugial love a chaste, pure and holy love? Do not the angels in heaven possess it? Is not the whole human race, and so the whole heaven of angels, the seed of that love? Surely something of such surpassing excellence cannot come into being from any source other than God Himself, the Creator and Upholder of the universe. You Christians trace the strength or potency of marriage to various rational and natural causes; but we Africans trace it to the way human beings are linked with the God of the universe. We call this the state of religion, but you the state of the church. For when love comes from this source, and it is firm and perpetual, it cannot help making its strength which resembles it also firm and perpetual. Truly conjugial love is unknown except to those few who are close to God. So no more is the potency of that love known to others; but this potency together with that love is described by angels in the heavens as the delight of a perpetual springtime.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #113 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>113. A rectangular screen had been set up in the palace in front of the doors, and behind it stood foreigners from Africa, who called to the natives of Europe, "Permit one of us to present an opinion, too, regarding the origin of conjugial love and its vigor or potency."<p>All the tables then signaled with their hands permission for him to do so.<p>Then one of them entered and stood beside the table on which the miter had been placed. He said:<p>"You Christians trace the origin of conjugial love from the love itself. We Africans, on the other hand, trace it from the God of heaven and earth.<p>"Is conjugial love not a chaste, pure and holy love? Are the angels of heaven not in an enjoyment of it? The whole human race, and therefore the entire angelic heaven - are they not the offspring of this love? Could anything so wonderful spring from any other source than God Himself, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe?<p>"You Christians trace the origin of conjugial vigor or potency from various rational and natural causes. We Africans, however, trace it from a person's state of conjunction with the God of the universe. (We call this state a state of religion, but you call it a state of the church.) We trace it from this origin, for when love comes from this source and is constant and lasting, it cannot help but maintain its vigor, a vigor that is like the love, thus also constant and lasting.<p>"Truly conjugial love is not known except to the few who are near to God. Neither, therefore, is the potency of this love known to others. Angels in heaven describe the potency accompanying this love as the delight of endless spring." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #113 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>113. Behind a long, low partition set up in the palace in front of the doors, stood some foreigners from Africa. They called out to the Europeans, "Let one of us express an opinion, too, about the source of love in marriage and about its vigor or potency."<p>Everyone at the tables signaled with their hands to let them do this.<p>Then one of the Africans came in and took a stand by the table with the tiara on it. He said, "You Christians trace the source of married love from the love itself. In Africa, though, we trace it from the God of heaven and earth. Isn't married love a pure, holy, and chaste love? Don't angels in heaven have it? Isn't the whole human race and the whole angelic heaven that comes from it the seed of that love? Can such an important thing come from anyone but God Himself, Creator and 5ustainer of the universe?<p>"You Christians trace the vigor or potency of marriage from various worldly and rational causes. We Africans trace it from how the person stands in conjunction with the God of the universe.<p>We call this the status of his religion, but you call it an ecclesiastical status. Now, since love is from this, and this is constant and perpetual, it can't help expressing its vigor, which is the image of it and therefore is just as constant and perpetual<p>"The real love in marriage is known only to those few who are near to God, so this love's potency is not known to anyone else. Angels in heaven describe this potency in married love as the delight of perpetual spring." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #113 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>113. Standing behind an oblong partition set up in the palace, facing the doors, were some strangers from Africa. These called out to the natives of Europe, "Permit one of us also to offer an opinion concerning the origin of conjugial love and its virtue or potency;" and all at the tables signified with their hands that it was allowed.<p>One of the strangers then entered and, standing by the table whereon the tiara had been placed, he said: "You Christians deduce the origin of conjugial love from the love itself, but we Africans deduce it from the God of heaven and earth. Is not conjugial love a love chaste, pure, and holy? Are not the angels of heaven in that love? Is not the whole human race and thence the whole angelic heaven the seed of that love? Can a thing so supereminent spring from any other source than God himself, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe? You Christians deduce conjugial virtue or potency from various rational and natural causes, but we Africans deduce it from the state of the conjunction of man with the God of the universe, a state which we call the state of religion, but you the state of the Church; for when the love is from this source and is stable and perpetual, it cannot do otherwise than operate its virtue, and this is like itself and so is also stable and perpetual. Love truly conjugial is known only to those few who are near to God, and therefore to no others is the potency of that love known. This potency with the love is described by angels in the heavens as the delight of perpetual spring." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #113 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>113. Behind a rather long partition, erected near the doors in the palace, some strangers from Africa were standing, who called out to the natives of Europe, "Allow one of us to offer an opinion about the origin of marital love and its vigor or potency."<p>All the tables agreed by show of hands to give permission.<p>One of the Africans thereupon entered and standing by the table on which the tiara was placed, said, "You Christians trace the origin of marital love to the love itself. We Africans trace it to the God of heaven and earth. Is not marital love a chaste, pure and holy love? Are not the angels of heaven in that love? Are not the whole human race and the whole angelic heaven therefrom the fruitage of that love? Can anything so preeminent have any other source than God Himself, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe? You Christians trace marital vigor or potency to different rational and natural causes. We Africans trace it to man's state of conjunction with the God of the universe. This state we call a state of religion, but you call it a state of the Church. For when the love is from that union and is steady and perpetual, it is bound to put forth its vigor which bears its likeness and therefore is also steady and perpetual. True marital love is the experience of the few who are near to God; and therefore the potency of that love is known to no others. The love and the potency are described by the angels in heaven as the delight of perpetual spring." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #113 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>113. Behind an oblong partition, erected before the doors in the palace, were standing some aliens from Africa, who called out to the natives of Europe, 'Permit some one of us also to offer an opinion concerning the origin of conjugial love, and its virtue or potency.'<p>And all at the tables gave signal with their hands that it should be permitted.<p>And then one of them entered and stood at the table whereon the tiara was placed, and said, 'You Christians deduce the origin of conjugial love from the love itself. But we Africans deduce it from the God of heaven and earth. Is not conjugial love a chaste love, pure and holy? Are not the angels of heaven in that love? Is not the whole human race and thence the whole angelic heaven the seed of that love? Can a thing so super-eminent spring from any other source than God Himself the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe? You Christians deduce conjugial virtue or potency from various rational and natural causes. But we Africans deduce it from the state of conjunction of man with the God of the universe. This state we call a state of religion, but you a state of the church. For since the love is thence, and is stable and perpetual, it cannot but put forth its virtue, which is of its likeness and so is also stable and perpetual. Love truly conjugial is known only to the few who are near to God; and therefore, the potency of that love is known to no others. This potency with that love is described by the angels in the heavens as the delight of perpetual spring.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #113 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>113. Steterunt post Tabulatum oblongum in Palatio ante fores erectum Alienigenae ex Africa, qui ad Indigenas Europae clamaverunt, "permittite ut quoque aliquis ex nobis proferat sententiam de Origine Amoris Conjugialis, ac de Virtute seu potentia ejus;" et omnes Mensae annuerunt manibus, quod liceret: et tunc unus ex illis intravit, et constitit ad Mensam, super qua Cidaris locata fuit. Hic dixit, "Vos Christiani deducitis Originem Amoris conjugialis ex ipso Amore; nos autem Africani deducimus illam ex Deo Coeli et Terrae; estne Amor Conjugialis Amor castus, purus et sanctus; suntne Angeli Coeli in illo; estne Universum Genus Humanum, et inde Universum Coelum Angelicum, Semen illius Amoris; num tale supereminens aliunde quam ab Ipso Deo Creatore et Statore universi potest existere. Vos Christiani Virtutem seu potentiam conjugialem deducitis ex variis causis rationalibus et naturalibus; nos autem Africani deducimus illam ex statu conjunctionis hominis cum Deo universi; hunc statum nos vocamus statum Religionis, vos autem statum Ecclesiae; nam cum Amor inde est, et hic stabilis et perpetuus, non potest ille aliter quam operari suam virtutem, quae ejus similis est, ita quoque stabilem et perpetuam: Amor vere conjugialis non est notus nisi paucis illis, qui propinqui Deo sunt; inde nec potentia illius amoris nota est aliis; haec cum illo ab Angelis in Coelis describitur ut delitium Veris perpetui." </p>
