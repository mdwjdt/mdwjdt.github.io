<h4 align="center"></h4><p>9、此后，天使向导返回大厅，转向那些坚信天上喜乐和永恒幸福就是对神的不断赞美和持续到永远的宗教庆典之人。因为他们在世时相信自己会见到神，认为基于敬拜神的天堂生活就是所谓的“永久安息日”。天使对他们说：“跟我来，我将引领你们体验你们所想象的快乐。”天使带他们来到一个小城镇，该城镇中央有一个教堂，所有房子都叫作神圣建筑物。在镇上，他们看见人群从周边的各个角落蜂拥而至，其中有许多牧师。这些牧师接待新来的人，问他们安，牵着他们的手，把他们领到教堂门口，又从教堂领进周围的神圣建筑物，从而将他们引入对神的没完没了地敬拜中。牧师对他们说：“这个城镇是天堂的前院，镇上的教堂是天堂宏伟教堂的入口，天使在那里以赞美和祷告荣耀神，直到永远。这两个地方的规则是：人们必须先进入教堂，在此呆三天三夜。仪式开始之后，你们得进入城镇的各个房间，它们全都是我们奉献给神的建筑物。经过一个个房间时，你们必须加入那里的教会祷告，大声赞美，朗声讲道。但最重要的是，你们务必当心，不要想、也不要和同伴说圣洁、虔诚和宗教以外的话。”<br><br>接着，天使带着一行人进入教堂，教堂里挤满了很多在世时位高权重者，以及平民百姓。教堂门口有守卫把守，以防有人在此没呆够三天就离开。天使说：“今天是这些人进来的第二天，仔细观察一下，你们就会明白他们是如何荣耀神的。”他们一看，发现绝大多数人都打盹睡着了，醒着的人也禁不住哈欠连天。由于他们不断将思维提升到神那里，不肯允许它们降回身体，所以有些人看似脸和身子分开了。有些人的眼睛由于不断向上翻而瞪得溜圆。总之，所有人都内心压抑，他们的灵因无聊而困倦。他们背对讲坛，大声叫喊：“我们的耳朵被震聋了，停止你们的讲道吧，我们再也听不进一个字，这声音令人厌恶。”于是，这些人起身，簇拥到门口，破门而出，制伏守卫，把他们赶走了。<br><br>看到这一幕，牧师紧随其后，挨着他们，在祷告叹息声中教导说：“你们要守这节，荣耀神，使自己成圣。在这天堂的前院，我们必带你们进入宏伟壮丽的天上教堂，在那里永远荣耀神，你们会因此享有永恒的幸福。”但他们听不懂这些话，甚至几乎听不见，因为两天来，他们的思维一直保持提升，远离了家庭和日常琐事，所以头脑已经迟钝。但当他们试图躲开时，牧师就抓住他们的胳膊和衣服，敦促他们回到讲道的房间，但无济于事。他们大声嚷嚷：“让我们走，我们快要晕倒了。”<br><br>话音刚落，四个身披白袍，戴着主教法冠的人出现了。其中一个在世时曾是大主教，另外三人是主教，他们现在全成了天使。他们将牧师们召集起来，对他们说：“我们从天上看到你们和你们的这群羊，也看到你们是怎么喂养他们的。你们正在把他们逼疯。你们不知道荣耀神是什么意思，它意味着结出爱的果实，也就是说，忠诚、正直、勤奋地做好自己的本职工作。因为这是爱神爱邻的一部分，是联结一个社群、构成其良善的纽带。这才是荣耀神的方式，当然还包括定期敬拜。难道你们没有读过主的这些话：<br><br>你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀；你们也就是我的门徒了。(约翰福音15:8)<br><br>你们牧师可以专注于敬拜和荣耀，因为这是你们的职责，你们由此得到尊贵、荣耀、奖赏。但若尊贵、荣耀、奖赏和你们的职责无关，你们和他们一样，也不能再专注于那荣耀。”说完这些话，主教令门口的守卫放行，允许所有人自由出入。他们说：“很多人除了将天上的喜乐想象为不断敬拜神外，想不出别的，因为他们对天堂一无所知。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>9、（1）做向导的天使回到大厅中，来到那些坚信天堂之乐，天国的幸福就是不断荣耀主，不停的宗教庆典的人中间，因为在世间时，他们相信他们将会见到神，因为天堂的生活因为崇拜神而成为永远的安息日。天使对他们说：“跟我来，我带你到你的快乐中去。”天使带他们到了一个小城，在城中有一座神殿，所有的房子都被叫做神圣殿堂。在那个城中，他们见到了来自周围每个角落的大量的人们。在他们当中有一些牧师。牧师们问候到来的人们，牵着他们的手，带领他们到神殿中，然后又到神殿周围的房子中。之后向他们介绍永无终止的崇拜神，说这座城市是通往天国的前庭，城中的神殿初步展示了天国中伟大，壮丽的神殿，在那座神殿中天使们永恒地赞美荣耀着神。</p><p>“规则是”他们说道：“在这儿以及在那里，人们必须这入这座神殿，停留在那里三天三夜。然后他们必须进入城中的房子里（全部是神圣的殿堂），从一个个建筑中经过，随同集会的人们，他们要祈祷，要讲道。</p><p>“最重要的是，你不能想或对同伴讲任何不神圣，不虔诚，与宗教无关的事情。”</p><p>（2）之后天使带领随行的人进入到神殿中。那里满是人，许多人在世间时拥有很高的地位，也有许多普通人。另外，门口有看守，防止人们在三天之内离开。</p><p>然后天使说：“今天是这些人来到这里的第二天。看到他们你们就会知道他们在荣耀神。”</p><p>于是他们就开始观察，他们看到大多数人都在睡觉，醒着的人们在不断地打着吹欠。因为不断向神上升的想法，他们会呈现出与躯体分离的面孔，因为他们自己就是这样的，所以对于别人也是这样。一些人因为不断变换眼神而目光凶狠。</p><p>简单地讲，他们看上去心情压抑，精神疲倦。他们转身离开神殿并叫喊到：我们的耳朵开始麻木！停下来吧！没有人能再听下去了，任何声音都让人厌倦。</p><p>（3）看到这些，牧师们走过来，来到他们中间，一边祈祷，一边讲道，叹息着说：“参加到宗教仪式中来！荣耀神！免去自己的罪恶！在这天堂的前院里，我们将帮你们准备好，到壮美的天国的神圣中永恒地荣耀神，你们将会进入到永恒的幸福之中。”</p><p>但是人们不懂并且几乎听不到牧师们在说什么，这是因为他们在此逗留两天并远离他们的生活和工作而使他们头脑麻木。</p><p>在他们要离开的时候，牧师们抓住他们的胳膊和衣服，催促他们回到讲道的神殿中去。无耐之下，他们喊道：“别打扰我们，我们感道似乎要昏倒！”</p><p>（4）说着，四个穿白衣服戴着头冠的人出现了。其中一个在世间时是个大主教，其它三个是主教。</p><p>他们召集牧师们，对他们说：“在天堂中我们看到你们及你们的信徒以及你们是如何教导他们的，你们使得他们发疯！你们不知道什么是荣耀神。荣耀神意味着献出爱的果实，也就是忠实勤勉地行使自己的职责。因为这就是爱神，爱他人，是它将整个社会约束起来，并使其完美。通过这些使得主得到荣耀，其后才是在固定的时间崇拜主。你们难道没有读过主的话吗？</p><p>你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。（《约翰福音》15:8）</p><p>（5）“你们牧师可以不断地通过崇拜来荣耀神，因为那是你们的职业。你们因此得到荣耀和报偿。但是，即使是你们也不会不断地荣耀神，如果你们得不到荣耀和报偿。”</p><p>说着，主教们让卫士让人们随意出入。他们说：“因为人们未能想道除了不断地崇拜神以外，还有什么是天国之乐。他们对于天堂的情况一无所知。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #9 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>9. After this the angel guide came back to the building to address those who had formed a strong conviction that heavenly joy and everlasting happiness were a perpetual glorification of God, and a festival lasting for ever. This was because in the world they had believed that they would then see God, and because life in heaven as the result of worshipping God is called 'a perpetual sabbath.'<p>'Follow me,' the angel told them, 'and I shall take you where you can experience your idea of joy.' He took them into a small town, in the middle of which there was a church, and all the houses were called sacred buildings. They saw in the town crowds coming from every corner of the surrounding country, and amongst them a number of priests. These received and greeted the new arrivals, and taking them by the hand brought them to the doors of the church, and from there to some buildings around it, and introduced them to the constant worship of God. They told them that this town was a forecourt leading to heaven, and its church was the entrance to a magnificent, vast church in heaven, where the angels glorify God with prayers and praises for ever. 'The rules here and also there,' they said, 'are that people must first enter the church and spend three days and three nights there. After this initiation they must go into the houses of the town, which are all sacred buildings dedicated by us; and then moving from one to another, they must join the congregations there in prayer, shouts of praise and the reading aloud of sermons. But above all you must be careful not to think to yourselves or say to companions anything but what is holy, pious and religious.'</p><p>[2] After this the angel took his party into the church, which was packed full with many who had held high rank in the world as well as many ordinary people. There were guards at the doors to prevent anyone leaving before spending his three days there. 'Today,' said the angel, 'is the second day since these people came in; look carefully at them, and you will see how they glorify God.'<p>When they looked, they saw that most were asleep, and those who were awake could not stop yawning. As a result of constantly keeping their thoughts raised to God, and never allowing them to drop back to the body, some appeared to themselves and so also to others as if their faces were shut off from the body. Some were wild-eyed from constantly withdrawing their eyes. In short, all were depressed at heart and weary in spirit from boredom. They turned their backs on the pulpit and shouted: 'Our ears are stunned. Put an end to your sermons; we cannot listen to another word and the sound of it is beginning to become hateful.' Then they got up, rushed in a body to the doors, broke them open and by pressure on the guards drove them out of the way.</p><p>[3] On seeing this the priests followed them and coming close beside them kept teaching them amid prayers and sighs. 'Keep the festival,' they said, 'glorify God, sanctify yourselves. In this forecourt to heaven we shall initiate you into the everlasting glorification of God in the magnificent, vast church which is in heaven, and so you will enjoy everlasting happiness.' But they were unable to grasp this and hardly heard it, because two days of keeping their thoughts raised and removed from domestic and everyday matters had dulled their minds. But when they tried to snatch themselves away, the priests caught hold of their arms and their clothes too, pressing them to enter the buildings where sermons were being delivered. All to no avail; the people cried, 'Leave us alone; we feel in our bodies as if we were fainting.'</p><p>[4] As soon as this was said, four men were seen, dressed in white robes and mitres. One of them had been an archbishop in the world and the other three had been bishops; all had now become angels. They called the priests together to address them. 'We have seen you,' they said, 'from heaven with this flock of yours, and what sort of pastors you are. You are driving them mad. You do not know what glorifying God means; it means bringing forth the fruits of love, that is, faithfully, honestly and painstakingly doing the work demanded by one's occupation. For this is a part of loving God and loving the neighbour; it is the bond which holds a community together, and it is the good it performs. By this God is glorified, as well as by worship at fixed times. Have you not read the Lord's words:<p>In this is my Father glorified, by your bringing forth much fruit and becoming my disciples. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>.</p><p>[5] 'You priests can devote yourselves to worship and glorification, because this is your duty, and it brings you honour, glory and reward. Still you could no more than they devote yourselves to that glorification, if honour, glory and reward did not attend upon your duty.'<p>With these words the bishops ordered the guards on the doors to allow everyone to enter and to leave. 'For,' they said, 'there is a vast number of people who are unable to imagine any joy in heaven other than constantly worshipping God, because they know nothing about conditions in heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #9 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>9. After that the angel guide returned to the hall, to the ones who had firmly persuaded themselves that heavenly joy and eternal happiness are a continual glorifying of God and a religious celebration lasting to eternity, because in the world they had believed that then they would see God, and because the life of heaven is called a perpetual Sabbath on account of its worship of God.<p>To them the angel said, "Follow me and I will introduce you to your joy." And he led them to a small city, in the middle of which was a temple, and all the houses were called sacred halls.<p>In that city they saw a flood of people from every corner of the surrounding land, and among them a number of priests. The priests met and greeted the people as they arrived and, taking them by the hand, led them to the doors of the temple and from there to some of the buildings around the temple. Then they introduced them into a never-ending worship of God, saying that this city was a forecourt to heaven, and that the temple of the city was an introduction to the magnificent and grand temple existing in heaven, where God is glorified by the angels with prayers and praises to eternity.<p>"The rules," they said, "both here and there, are that people must first enter the temple and stay there three days and three nights. Then after that initiation they must go into the houses of the city (all of them sacred halls that we have sanctified), and passing from building to building, in communion with the congregations there they must pray, cry out, and deliver sermons.<p>"Above all," they said, "be careful that you do not think to yourselves or say to your companions anything that is not reverent, pious and religious."</p><p>[2] Afterwards the angel led his company into the temple. It was packed full of people, many of whom had been in high position in the world, and also many who had been of the common people. Moreover, guards had been stationed at the doors to prevent anyone from leaving before his three days were up.<p>Then the angel said, "Today is the second day since these people came in. Look at them and you will see their glorifying of God."<p>So they looked, and they saw most of the people sleeping, and the ones who were awake kept yawning and yawning. Furthermore, because of the continual elevation of their thoughts to God without returning again back down into the body, some of them appeared to have faces separated from their bodies, for that is how they seemed to themselves, and so that is how they appeared to others as well. Some looked wild-eyed from constantly averting their gaze.<p>In short, they all looked oppressed at heart and weary in spirit with boredom, and turning away from the pulpit they began crying, "Our ears are growing numb! Put an end to your sermons! No one is listening to a word any more, and the very sound is becoming detestable."<p>And then they got up and rushed en masse to the doors, broke them open, and pressing upon the guards drove them away.</p><p>[3] Seeing this, the priests followed them and attached themselves to their sides, preaching and teaching, praying, sighing, and saying, "Join in the religious celebration! Glorify God! Sanctify yourselves! In this forecourt of heaven we will prepare you for the eternal glorifying of God in the magnificent and grand temple which is in heaven, that you may enter the enjoyment of eternal happiness."<p>But the people did not understand and scarcely even heard what the priests were saying, owing to their numbness from having their minds suspended for two days and from being withheld from their domestic and occupational concerns.<p>When they tried to pull away from the priests, however, the priests took hold of their arms and also their garments, urging them to the halls where the sermons were to be delivered. But in vain. And the people began crying out, "Leave us alone. Our bodies feel as though we are about to faint!"</p><p>[4] At these words, behold, four men appeared in bright white clothing and wearing miters. One of them had been an archbishop in the world, and the other three, bishops. Now they had become angels.<p>They called together the priests and addressing them said, "From heaven we have seen you with your flock and how you feed them. You feed them to insanity! You do not know what is meant by glorifying God. It means to bring forth the fruits of love, that is, to perform the work of one's occupation faithfully, honestly, and diligently. For this is the effect of love of God and love of the neighbor, and it is what binds society together and makes its goodness. It is by this that God is glorified, and afterwards by worship at prescribed times. Have you not read these words of the Lord:<p>By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and become My disciples. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>)</p><p>[5] "You priests can go on glorifying in worship because it is your profession, and from it you have honor, glory and remuneration. But even you could not go on glorifying like that any more than they if honor, glory and remuneration did not come with your office."<p>So saying, the bishops ordered the keepers of the doors to let everyone pass in and out. "For," they said, "there is a host of people who have been unable to imagine any other heavenly joy than everlasting worship of God, because they have known nothing about the state of heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #9 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>9. After this the angel guide went back into the hall, to the people who had firmly persuaded themselves that the joy of heaven and eternal happiness are perpetual glorification of God and a religious holiday around the calendar to eternity, because in the world they had believed that then they would see God, and because the life of heaven is called a perpetual Sabbath because it is worship of God.<p>The angel told them, "Follow me, and I will take you to your joys," and he led them into a small city with a temple in the middle of it, and all the houses were known as sacred buildings.<p>In this city they saw people streaming in from every corner of the surrounding country, and among them a number of priests who received the new arrivals, greeted them, and led them by the hand to the doors of the temple and from there into some of the buildings around the temple and introduced them into the perpetual worship of God, saying, "This city is an entryway to heaven, and the temple of the city is the entrance to a magnificent and very spacious temple in heaven where the angels glorify God with prayers and praises to eternity. The regulations, both here and there, are that people who arrive have to go into the temple first and stay there three days and three nights, and after this initiation they must go into the city's houses, which are so many buildings consecrated by us, and pray, shout, and recite sermons from house to house together with the people gathered there.<p>"Be especially careful not to think to yourself, or say to your companions, anything but what is holy, pious, and religious."<p>Then the angel led his group into the temple, which was packed full with many who had enjoyed great honor in the world, and with many common people, too. There were guards posted at the doors to keep anyone from going out before the three - day stay was over.<p>The angel said, "Today is the second day since these people came in. Look at them! Look at their glorification of God!"<p>They looked around and saw most of them sleeping, and the ones that were awake yawned continually. Some looked like faces separated from their bodies from raising their thoughts continually to God and not letting them slip back to their bodies. In fact, they actually looked that way to themselves, and therefore to others.<p>Some looked wild - eyed from being carried away without letup.<p>In a word, all of them were tight - chested and sick at heart from boredom. They turned away from the pulpit, shouting, "Our ears are getting numb! End your sermon! The sound is starting to make us wince!"<p>And then they stood up and rushed en masse to the doors, broke them open, pushed the guards, and drove them away.<p>When the priests saw this, they followed after them and stuck close beside them, preaching on and on, praying, sighing, and saying, "Celebrate the festival! Glorify God! Sanctify yourselves!<p>In this entry hall to heaven we are going to introduce you to eternal glorification of God in a huge, magnificent temple in heaven, so you will enjoy eternal happiness."<p>But they did not grasp these words and hardly heard them, due to the stupefaction resulting from two days of elevating their minds and being kept away from their domestic and public concerns.<p>But when they tried to tear themselves away from the priests, the priests grabbed them by the arms and by the clothing, too, pushing them toward the buildings to read sermons there. But in vain. They shouted, "Let go of us! We feel like we're about to faint!"<p>When they said that, four men in white robes and miters appeared! One of them had been an archbishop in the world, and the other three were bishops. Now they were angels. They called the priests together and spoke to them. "We saw you from heaven with these sheep. How you feed them!" they said. "You feed them to insanity! You don't know what it means to glorify God. It means to produce things from love. In other words, to faithfully, sincerely, and diligently do whatever work you do. This, indeed, is love of God and love of your neighbor. This is the bond of society and the good of it. God is glorified by this, and then by worship at the appropriate times. Haven't you read the words of the Lord? 'My Father is glorified in the fact that you bear fruit, and you will become My disciples' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>). You, as priests, can glorify through worship as an occupation because it is your employment, and you get honor, fame, and pay for it. But if the honor, fame, and pay were not part and parcel of your employment, you couldn't make glorification through worship your occupation any more than they can."<p>After saying these things the bishops ordered the doorkeepers, "Let everyone go in and out, because a great many people cannot comprehend any heavenly joy other than perpetual worship of God, since they do not know anything about what heaven is like." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #9 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>9. After this the angel guide returned to the house of assembly to those who had firmly persuaded themselves that heavenly joy and eternal happiness consist in a perpetual glorification of God, and a festival continuing to eternity, being persuaded of this because in the world they had believed that they were then to see God, and because from the worship of God, the life of heaven is called a perpetual Sabbath. To these the angel said: "Follow me and I will introduce you into your joys."<p>He then introduced them into a small city, in the midst of which was a temple, and all the houses of which were called sacred buildings. In this city they saw a great concourse of people flocking in from every corner of the surrounding country, and among them a number of priests. These received the new-comers, and after saluting them, took them by the hand and led them to the temple gate, and from there into some of the buildings round about the temple. There they initiated them into the perpetual worship of God, saying: "This city is an entrance court to heaven, and the city's temple is the entrance to a magnificent and most spacious temple which is in heaven. There God is glorified by the angels with prayers and praises to eternity. The regulations, both here and there, are that new-comers shall first enter the temple and abide there three days and three nights. After this initiation, they are to go to the houses of the city, which are so many buildings consecrated by us, and from building to building, and, in communion with those assembled therein, are to pray, cry out and recite sermons. Take great care that, within yourselves, you think of nothing and, with your companions, speak of nothing but what is holy, pious and religious."</p><p>[2] The angel then introduced his company into the temple. It was filled and crowded with many who in the world had been in great dignity, and also with many of the common people. At its doors, guards were stationed lest any one go out before he had stayed there three days. And the angel said: "Today is the second day since those here present came in. Observe them and you will see their glorification of God."<p>On observation, they saw many of them sleeping, and those who were awake, perpetually yawning. Some, from the continual uplifting of their thoughts to God and no return thereof into the body, they saw as faces shut off from their bodies, for so did they seem to themselves and thus to others also. Some they saw with delirium in their eyes, arising from their perpetual abstraction. In a word, they saw them oppressed in breast and weary in spirit from disgust, all turning away from the pulpit and crying out: "Our ears are stunned. Put an end to your preaching; not a word is any longer listened to and the very sound begins to be loathsome." And then, rising up, they rushed in a body to the doors and, breaking them open, pressed upon the guards and drove them away.</p><p>[3] Seeing this, the priests followed and pressed close to them, teaching, beseeching, sighing, and saying: "Celebrate the festival! Glorify God! Sanctify yourselves! In this entrance court of heaven we will initiate you into the eternal glorification of God in a magnificent and spacious temple which is in heaven, and so into the enjoyment of eternal happiness." But these entreaties were not understood by them and were hardly heard on account of the dullness caused by their two days' suspension of mental activity and their detention from their domestic and forensic affairs. When they struggled to tear themselves away from the priests, the latter seized them by their arms and also by their garments, urging them to the sacred buildings where they were to preach, but in vain. "Let us alone"' they cried. "We feel as though our body were in a swoon."</p><p>[4] At these words, lo, four men appeared in bright white raiment and wearing miters. In the world, one of them had been an archbishop, and the other three, bishops. They had now become angels. They called the priests together and, addressing them, said: "We saw you from heaven with these sheep, and saw how you feed them. You feed them even to insanity. You do not know what is meant by the glorification of God. It means bringing forth the fruits of love, that is, doing the work of one's employment faithfully, sincerely, and diligently, this being the effect of love to God and of love to the neighbor. Moreover, it is the bond of society and its good. It is by this that God is glorified, and then by worship at set times. Have you not read these words of the Lord:</p><p>[5] Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. And ye shall become my disciples? <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>.<p>You priests can be in the glorification of worship because this is your office, and from it you have honor, glory, and recompense; but even you could not be in that glorification any more than they, were it not that honor, glory, and recompense are connected with your office."<p>Having thus spoken, the bishop commanded the keepers of the gate to let all in and out freely, "for there are multitudes who, in their ignorance concerning the state of heaven, can think of no other heavenly joy than perpetual worship of God." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #9 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>9. Herewith the angel guide returned to the hall, to those who were firmly persuaded that heavenly joy and eternal happiness are a perpetual glorification of God and a service maintained to eternity. Their persuasion grew out of their belief in the world that they would see God, and out of the fact that the life of heaven from its worship of God is called a perpetual Sabbath.<p>The angel said to them, "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joy." He led them into a small city, in the center of which stood a temple, and all of the houses in which were called sacred buildings. In this city they saw people gathered from every corner of the surrounding country, and among them a number of priests, who met and greeted the arrivals, and leading them by the hand to the temple-gates and into some of the buildings around the temple, initiated them into the perpetual worship of God. They told them that the city was a forecourt of heaven, and that the temple was the entrance to a magnificent and very large temple in heaven, where the angels glorify God with prayers and praises to eternity. "The regulations, both here and there, are that you enter the temple and remain three days and three nights, and then proceed into the city's homes, which are so many chapels we have consecrated, and go from chapel to chapel, and pray, proclaim and preach in fellowship with those assembled there. Take every care to speak to your companions, and to think, only what is holy, pious and religious."</p><p>[2] The angel then led his company into the temple, which was filled to the doors with many who had stood high in the world, and also with many of the common people. Guards were stationed at the doors, permitting no one to leave who had not remained the three days. The angel remarked: "These worshipers have been here two days. Observe them and you will see how they glorify God." They looked, and most were asleep, and those who were awake yawned again and again. Some - what with the constant uplifting of their thoughts to God, without consideration for the body - looked like faces severed from the body. They felt so to themselves, and hence appeared so to others. Some were wild-eyed from gazing into space. In short, their breathing was labored, and they were wearied in spirit from the tedium. They had their backs to the pulpit, and were shouting, "Our ears are stunned. Bring your sermons to an end. We no longer hear a word, and begin to loathe the sound." Then they arose, rushed in a body to the doors, broke them open, jostled the guards and drove them off.</p><p>[3] Seeing this the priests followed, and clinging close to them, went on teaching and praying, sighing and exhorting, "Keep up the service! Glorify God! Sanctify yourselves! In this forecourt of heaven we will initiate you into everlasting glorification of God in a magnificent and most spacious temple in heaven, and so into the enjoyment of eternal happiness."<p>But these appeals went uncomprehended and were hardly heard, so dull were their minds after the two days' inactivity and detention from domestic and business affairs. Still, when they tried to get away, the priests seized them by the arms and sleeves, to push them into the buildings where they were to preach; but in vain. The people cried, "Let us alone! We shall swoon."</p><p>[4] At these words there appeared four men in mitres and white raiment. One of these had been an archbishop in the world, and the other three, bishops; all now were angels. They called the priests together and said to them: "From heaven we saw you and these sheep, and took note how you feed them. You feed them even to insanity. You do not know what the glorification of God means. It means to bring forth the fruits of love; that is, to do the work of one's calling faithfully, sincerely and diligently. For this belongs to love for God and to love for the neighbor, and is the bond of society, and its well-being. By this is God glorified, and then at stated times by worship. Have you not read these words of the Lord?<p>Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear fruit, and be made my disciples (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>).</p><p>[5] You priests can persist in glorification by worship, for that is your office and thence are your glory, honor and reward; but not even you, any more than they, could continue in that glorification were not glory, honor and reward connected with your office."<p>So saying the bishops ordered the doorkeepers to let all in and out freely, "for there is a mass of people who can imagine no heavenly joy other than perpetual worship of God, so ignorant are they about the state of heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #9 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>9. After this the angel guide returned again to the building, to those who had firmly persuaded themselves that heavenly joy and eternal happiness are a perpetual glorification of God and a festival continuing to eternity; because in the world they had believed that they should then see God, and because the life of heaven is called from the worship of God a perpetual sabbath.<p>The angel said to them, 'Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joy.'<p>And he brought them to a small city, in the midst of which was a temple, and all the houses were called sacred buildings. In this city they saw a gathering from every corner of the surrounding country; and among them a number of priests, who received the comers, saluted them, and taking them by the hand led them to the gates of the temple, and from thence into some of the buildings around the temple, and initiated them into the perpetual worship of God, saying:<p>'This city is an entrance court of heaven; and the temple of the city is the entrance to a very magnificent and spacious temple which is in heaven, where God is glorified in prayers and praises by the angels to eternity. The regulations, both here and there, are, that they who come are first to enter the temple and abide there three days and three nights; and after this initiation are to go into the houses of the city, which are so many buildings consecrated by us, and go from building to building, and in communion with those assembled therein to pray, shout, and recite sermons:<p>'Take great care that you think nothing within yourselves and speak nothing with your companions, but what is holy, pious, and religious.'<p>The angel then introduced his company into the temple, which was filled and crowded with many who in the world had been in great dignity, and with many of the common people also; and guards were stationed at the gates lest anyone should go out before abiding there three days. And the angel said:<p>'This is the second day since these entered. Observe them, and you will see their glorification of God.'<p>And they observed and saw most of them sleeping, and they that were awake were yawning and gaping; and some they saw - from the continual uplifting of their thoughts to God and no return of them into the body - as faces cut off from the body; for thus they appeared to themselves and thence also to others. Some looked wild in the eyes from their perpetual abstraction. In a word all were oppressed at heart and weary in spirit from tedium; and they turned away from the pulpit crying out:<p>'Our ears are stunned. End your preaching, we no longer hear a word, and are beginning to loathe the sound.'<p>And then they arose and rushed in a body to the gates, broke them open, and pressed upon the guards and drove them away. Seeing this the priests followed, and clung close beside them, teaching and teaching, praying, sighing, and saying:<p>'Celebrate the festival! Glorify God! Sanctify yourselves! In this entrance court of heaven, we will induct you into the eternal glorification of God in a most magnificent and spacious temple which is in heaven, and so into the enjoyment of eternal happiness.'<p>But these entreaties were not understood and were scarcely heard by them, on account of their dullness from the two days' suspension of mental activity and detention from their domestic and out-door affairs. But when they tried to tear themselves away from the priests, the priests seized them by their arms, and also by their garments, urging them to the buildings where they were to preach; but in vain, for they cried out, 'Let us alone. We feel in our body as if we should drop down.'<p>At these words, lo! four men appeared in bright white raiment and wearing miters. One of them in the world had been an archbishop, and the three others had been bishops. They had now become angels. They called the priests together, and addressing them said:<p>'We saw you from heaven with these sheep, and how you feed them. You feed them even to insanity. You do not know what is meant by the glorification of God. It means, to bring forth the fruits of love; that is, faithfully, sincerely, and diligently to do the work of one's employment - for this is of love to God and of love to the neighbor. And this is the bond of society and its good. By this God is glorified, and then by worship at stated times. Have you not read these words of the Lord:<p>'Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. So shall ye become my disciples. ' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>).<p>You priests can be in the glorification of worship, because it is your office, and you have honor, glory, and recompense therefrom; but you no more than they could be in that glorification if there were not the honor, glory, and recompense connected with your office.'<p>Having said this the bishops commanded the keepers of the gate that they should let all go in and all go out, 'for there is a multitude who can think of no other heavenly joy than perpetual worship of God, because they have known nothing about the state of heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #9 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>9. Post haec Angelus ductor rediit in Aedem, ad illos, qui firmiter sibi persuaserant, quod Gaudium coeleste et Felicitas aeterna sit perpetua Glorificatio Dei, ac in aeternum perennans Festum; ex causa, quia in Mundo crediderant, quod tunc visuri sint Deum, et quia vita Coeli ex cultu Dei vocatur perpetuum Sabbathum. His angelus dixit, "sequimini me, et introducam vos in gaudium vestrum;" et introduxit illos in parvam urbem, in cujus medio erat Templum, et omnes domus vocabantur aedes sacrae. In illa urbe viderunt affluentiam ex omni angulo terrae circumjacentis, et inter illos numerum Sacerdotum, qui venientes suscipiebant, salutabant, et prehensos manibus ducebant ad portas Templi, et inde in aliquas aedes circum Templum, et initiabant illos in perennem cultum Dei; dicentes, quod haec urbs sit atrium ad Coelum, et quod hujus urbis Templum sit introitus ad magnificum et amplissimum Templum quod in Coelo est, ubi Deus precibus et laudibus ab Angelis glorificatur in aeternum: "statuta hic et ibi sunt, quod primum intraturi sint Templum, et commoraturi ibi tres dies et tres noctes, et quod post hoc initiamentum ingressuri sint in hujus urbis domos, quae sunt totidem a nobis sanctificatae aedes, et ab aede in aedem, et in communione cum congregatis ibi, oraturi, clamaturi, et recitaturi concionata: omnino cavete vobis, ne aliud in vobis cogitetis, et cum consociis loquamini, quam sancta, pia et religiosa."</p><p>[2] Post haec introduxit Angelus comitatum suum in Templum, quod erat plenum et constipatum multis, qui in magna dignitate in Mundo fuerant, et quoque multis ex plebe, et praesidia ad portas collocata erant, ne cuiquam ante commorationem trium dierum liceret exire; et dixit Angelus, "est hodie secundus dies, a quo hi ingressi sunt; lustrate illos, et glorificationem Dei illorum videbitis;" et lustrabant, et viderunt plerosque dormientes, et qui evigilati sunt, oscitantes et oscitantes, et quosdam ex continua elevatione cogitationum ad Deum, et ex nullo relapsu illarum in corpus, sicut facies reclusas a corpore, ita enim sibi apparebant, et inde etiam aliis; quosdam deliros oculis ex perpetua subtractione illorum; verbo, omnes compressos pectore, et lassos spiritu ex taedio, et aversos a pulpito, et clamantes, "stupescunt aures nostrae, finite conciones, non auditur amplius vox, et incipit fastidiri sonus:" et tunc surrexerunt, et in globo concurrerunt ad portas, effregerunt illas, et urgebant in praesidia, et abigebant illa.</p><p>[3] His visis, Sacerdotes sequuti sunt illos, et adjunxerunt se lateribus illorum, docentes et docentes, orantes, suspirantes, dicentes, "celebrate Festum, glorificate Deum, sanctificate vos; in atrio hoc Coeli inaugurabimus vos in aeternam Glorificationem Dei in magnifico et amplissimo Templo <sup>1</sup>quod in Coelo est, et sic ad fruitionem aeternae felicitatis." Sed haec ab illis non intellecta, et vix audita sunt, propter hebetudinem ex duorum dierum suspensione mentis, et retentione a domesticis et forensibus. Sed cum se a Sacerdotibus avellere conati sunt, sacerdotes apprehendebant brachia illorum, et quoque vestes, urgentes ad aedes, ubi concionata recitarentur; sed frustra; et clamabant, "relinquite nos, sentimus in corpore sicut deliquium."</p><p>[4] His dictis, ecce visi sunt quatuor Viri in candidis vestibus, et in tiaris; unus ex illis fuerat in Mundo Archi Episcopus, et tres reliqui fuerant Episcopi, nunc facti Angeli: hi convocabant Sacerdotes, et alloquuti illos dixerunt, "vidimus vos e Coelo cum ovibus his, quomodo vos pascitis illos; pascitis illos usque ad insanias; nescitis quid per Glorificationem Dei intelligitur; intelligitur fructus amoris ferre, hoc est, fideliter, sincere, et sedule suae functionis opus facere, hoc enim est amoris Dei, et amoris proximi, et hoc est vinculum Societatis, et bonum ejus; per hoc glorificatur Deus, et tunc per cultum statis temporibus; annon legistis haec Domini verba, In hoc Glorificatur Pater meus, ut fructum multum feratis, et reddamini discipuli mei, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_9/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_8" target=_top>Joh. 15:8</a>.</p><p>[5] Vos Sacerdotes potestis in cultus glorificatione esse, quia hoc est vestrum munus, et inde est vobis honor, gloria et remuneratio, sed usque vos non potestis plus quam illi in ea glorificatione esse, nisi honor, gloria, et remuneratio una cum vestro munere sint." His dictis Episcopi mandabant custodibus portae, ut intromitterent omnes, et emitterent omnes, "est enim multitudo, qui non aliud gaudium Coeleste, quam perpetuum cultum Dei, potuerunt cogitare, quia non sciverunt aliquid de statu Coeli." <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: Templo, </p>
