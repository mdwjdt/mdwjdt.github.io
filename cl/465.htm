<h4 align="center"></h4><p>465、⑶它是在基督教界被定罪并逐出的一夫多妻。既找情妇或纳妾，同时又与妻子联结，就是一夫多妻，尽管没有被这样认定，因为还没有任何法律如此规定，因而如此命名。任何人，即便头脑不敏锐，也能看到这一点。这个女人被用作一个妻子和婚床的共享者。一夫多妻那一章（15章）已证明，一夫多妻在基督教界被定罪并逐出，那里尤其说明：基督徒不可娶数个妻子（338节）；娶数个妻子的基督徒不但犯了属世的奸淫，还犯了属灵的奸淫（339节）；以色列民族之所以被允许，是因为他们当中没有基督教会（340节）。由此明显可知，在妻子之外又找情妇或纳妾，并与这二者共享一张床，其实就是污秽的一夫多妻。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>465、（3）尽管它不被以这一词命名，但实际上是一种一夫多妻制。因为有一个另外的妻子，有一个婚姻的分享者。</p><p>关于一夫多妻制应该并且已经被基督教所禁止，我们在关于一夫多妻制一章中已经讲过，尤其是在以下几方面：基督教有不止一个妻子是非法的（338节）；若基督教徒不只一个妻子，那他不但犯了自然意义上的通奸罪，还犯了精神意义上的通奸罪（339节）；一夫多妻制在以色列民族中被允许是因为基督教不存在于他们之中（340节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #465 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>465. (iii) It is polygamy, a practice condemned and to be banished from the Christian world.<p>Having a concubine at the same time as or in association with a wife is polygamy, even if not recognised as such, because it has not been laid down and so named by any law. Anyone, even if not perspicacious, can see this. For the woman is like a wife used for enjoyment and a partner in the marriage bed. It was proved in the chapter on polygamy [XV] that this was condemned and to be banished from the Christian world, especially where it was shown that a Christian is not allowed to marry more than one wife (<a href="338.htm">338</a>); and that a Christian who marries several commits not only natural, but also spiritual adultery (<a href="339.htm">339</a>). This was allowable for the Israelite people, because the Christian church did not yet exist. (<a href="340.htm">340</a>). It is obvious from these considerations that having a concubine in addition to a wife and sharing a bed with either is foul polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #465 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>465. 3. It is polygamy, which has been banned from the Christian world, and ought to be banned. Even though it is not recognized as such, because it has not been so stated and thus defined by some law, everyone sees, even without keen perception, that taking a mistress simultaneously or conjointly with the wife is polygamy. For the woman is a kind of extra wife and a sharer of the marriage bed.<p>As for the point that polygamy has been banned and ought to be banned from the Christian world, this we established in the chapter on polygamy, especially by the following considerations there: that it is not lawful for a Christian to have more than one wife (no. <a href="338.htm">338</a>); that if a Christian takes more than one, he commits not only natural adultery but spiritual adultery as well (no. <a href="339.htm">339</a>); and that polygamy was permitted to the Israelite nation because in it the Christian Church did not exist (no. <a href="340.htm">340</a>).<p>It is apparent from this that to take a mistress in addition to one's wife and to share a bed with each is a foul form of polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #465 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>465. 3. It is polygamy, which is condemned in the Christian world, and ought to be. Everyone can see, even without much perception, that having a concubine at the same time or in connection with a wife is polygamy, even though it is not identified as such because it is not established by any law and given the name that way, for the woman serves as a wife and marriage - bed partner.<p>The chapter on polygamy has shown that polygamy is condemned by the Christian world, and ought to be - mainly by these articles there: It is not lawful for a Christian to take more than one wife (no. <a href="338.htm">338</a>). And if a Christian takes more than one, he commits not only worldly adultery but also spiritual adultery (no. 339).<p>The Israelite nation were allowed to do it because the Christian church was not among them (no. 340).<p>These points make it clear that it is foul polygamy to add a concubine to a wife and share your bed with both. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #465 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>465. III. THAT IT IS POLYGAMY, WHICH IS BANNED FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD, AND SHOULD BE BANNED. That simultaneous concubinage, or concubinage conjointly <sup >1</sup>with the wife, is polygamy, though not acknowledged as such because not so decreed by any law and thus not so denominated, is seen by every one, even if not clear-sighted; for the woman is used as a wife and a sharer of the conjugial couch. That polygamy is banned from the Christian world and should be banned was proved in the chapter on polygamy, especially from the following: That for a Christian it is not lawful to marry more than one wife (no. <a href="338.htm">338</a>); and that if a Christian marries more wives than one, he commits not only natural adultery but also spiritual adultery (no. <a href="339.htm">339</a>); that it was permitted the Israelitish nation because with that nation there was no Christian Church (no. <a href="340.htm">340</a>). From this it is clear that to adjoin a concubine to the wife, and share the bed with both, is filthy polygamy.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Reading conjunctim for conjuntus. So also twice in no. <a href="466.htm">466</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #465 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>465. (iii) It is polygamy, and polygamy should be condemned, as it is, by Christendom. Every one, even a man who is not perspicacious, sees that simultaneous concubinage or concubinage together with the wife is polygamy, though it is not so recognized, not being so defined or named by law. For the woman used is like an additional wife in sharing the marriage bed. We showed in the chapter on "Polygamy" that polygamy is condemned and should be condemned in Christendom, especially under these propositions there: a Christian may not take more than one wife (<a href="338.htm">338</a>); the Christian who takes more than one wife commits not only natural adultery but spiritual as well (<a href="339.htm">339</a>); polygamy was permitted the people of Israel as there was no Christian Church with them (<a href="340.htm">340</a>). Thence it is plain that to add a concubine to the wife and to share the bed with both is filthy polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #465 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>465. (3) That it is polygamy, which by the Christian world is condemned, and ought to be condemned. That concubinage at the same time or conjointly with a wife is polygamy, though not acknowledged as such, because not established by any law, and not so-called, everyone sees even if not clear-sighted; for a woman kept for use and a sharer of the conjugial bed is as a wife. That polygamy is condemned, and ought to be condemned by the Christian world, has been shown on the chapter On Polygamy, especially under these heads in that chapter: That it is not permitted to a Christian to marry more than one wife, n. <a href="338.htm">338</a>; and that if a Christian marries more wives than one, he commits not only natural adultery, but also spiritual adultery, n. 339; that it was permitted to the Israelitish nation because there was no Christian Church with them, n. <a href="340.htm">340</a>. From which it is plain that to join to a wife a concubine and share the bed with both is filthy polygamy. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #465 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>465. III. Quod sit polygamia, quae ex orbe Christiano damnata est et damnanda. Quod Concubinatus simultaneus seu conjunctus cum uxore, sit polygamia tametsi non agnita, quia non per aliquam legem statuta, et sic nominata, omnis, etiam non perspicax, videt; est enim foemina sicut uxor usuraria et concuba spondae conjugialis: quod polygamia e Christiano Orbe sit damnata et damnanda, in Capite de Polygamia evictum est; imprimis ex his ibi; Quod non liceat Christiano nisi unam uxorem ducere, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_465/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_338" target=_top>338</a>: et quod Christianus, si plures ducit, non modo adulterium naturale, sed etiam adulterium spirituale, committat, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_465/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_339" target=_top>339</a>: quod permissa fuerit genti Israeliticae, quia apud illam Ecclesia Christiana non fuit, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_465/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_340" target=_top>340</a>: ex his patet, quod concubinam adjungere uxori, et cum utraque sociare lectum, sit foeda polygamia. </p>
