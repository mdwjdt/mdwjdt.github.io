<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第446节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>446、⑵当青少年开始运用自己的理解力思考和行事，并且说话的嗓音开始变得男性化时，两性情爱就开始了。引证这一点是为了叫人知道，当理解力本身开始变得理性，也就是说，开始凭自己的理性探究并找出有益、有用之物时，两性情爱、因而淫行就开始了。这时，对父母、老师的教导的记忆作为一个基础而服务于它。此时此刻，心智会经历一个转折。在此之前，男孩的思维仅局限于导入记忆的事，他反复琢磨并服从这些记忆。之后，他凭理性思考它们；然后在爱的引导下，重新排列保留在记忆中的事，并开始照着这个新次序过自己的生活。其思维逐渐变得越来越受自己理性支配，并且他可以自由行使自己的意志。众所周知，两性情爱随着人自己的理解力的启蒙而来，并照着它的活力发展。这表明这爱会随着理解力上升而上升，随着它下降而下降。上升是指获得智慧，下降是指陷入疯狂；约束两性情爱的，正是智慧，而疯狂却放任不管。若这爱陷入淫行，也就是其活动的初始阶段，那么出于早已植入记忆，由此植入理性，后来则植入理性，由此植入记忆的正派与道德的准则，此人理应抑制它。当男人的理解力开始发展时，他的嗓音之所以开始变得男性化，是因为进行思维，并通过思维说话的是理解力。这表明理解力构成男人，也构成他的男性特质。因此，随着他的理解力被提升，他变成一个成年人，也变成一个男性（参看432，433节）。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>446、（2）在此讲这点是为了指出放荡性行为开始的起点。即当少年的才智发展到可以独立地思考、探索，按自己的理性去行为，而父母、老师的教导成了它的基础。</p><p>那时，思想中会出现一次变革。在此之前头脑是按被注入其中的观点进行思考。而那以后却是按理性，由其爱领导，在头脑中形成新的一系列意识并由此去创建自己的脑海。即头脑会此时越来越按理性而自由行为。</p><p>人们知道对异性的爱在少年自己才智开始发展时产生，并与其一起发展——才智上升，爱也上升，才智下降爱也下降的证据。上升是指它发展为智慧，下降是指它变为疯狂。智慧会限制人的对异性的爱，而疯狂性却使其失去约束。它若发展到第一阶段，即放荡的性行为 ，则应该受到道德的约束，即存在于他头脑的原则，其后要将其保留在理性当中，并进入到记忆中。</p><p>以上说明，是才智使男人更成为男人。若他的才智得到提升，他就会成为一个更有人性的男人（参见432，433节）</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #446 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>446. (ii) Sexual love starts when a youth begins to use his own intellect to think and act, and his speaking voice begins to show male characteristics.<p>This point is made in order to make it known that the stage at which sexual love and thus fornication start is when the intellect begins to become rational of itself, to investigate, that is, and seek out what things are beneficial and useful. The basis for this is then provided by the memory of the teachings of parents and instructors. At that time the mind undergoes a change. Previously thinking had been restricted to matters committed to memory, mulling them over and obeying them. Afterwards thinking is controlled by reasoning about these matters; and then, under the guidance of love, the matters retained in the memory are re-arranged, and he begins to live his own life in accordance with their new order. By stages his thought becomes more and more controlled by his own reason, and he is free to exercise his will.<p>It is well known that sexual love follows the emergence of a person's own intellect, and develops in keeping with its vigour. This is an indication that this love increases as the intellect develops and decreases as it declines. By increasing we mean acquiring wisdom, by declining lapsing into folly. It is wisdom to restrain sexual love, folly to give it wide scope. If it leads to fornication, which is the start of its activity, it needs to be controlled by the principles of decency and morality which have been implanted in the memory and so the reason, and must later be implanted in the reason and so in the memory. The reason why when a person's intellect begins to develop, the voice begins to become a man's is that the intellect thinks and expresses its thoughts in speech. This is an indication that it is the intellect which makes a man, and also his masculinity. As a result, he becomes an adult and also a male, as his intellect is raised (see above <a href="433.htm">433-434</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #446 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>446. 2. A love for the opposite sex, from which fornication stems, arises when the adolescent youth begins to think and act in accordance with his own intellect, and the sound of his voice begins to become manly. We present this observation in order to make known the point at which a love for the opposite sex and thus fornication begins, namely, when the intellect begins to become independently rational or to see and explore matters that are of advantage and use in accordance with its own reason, whatever is in the memory from parents and teachers then serving it as a foundation.<p>At that time a revolution occurs in the mind. Previously the intellect thought only in accordance with ideas instilled in the memory, thinking in terms of them and being governed by them. Afterwards it thinks in accordance with reason about them. And then, guided by its love, it disposes the matters residing in the memory into a new order, and establishes its own life in conformity to it, so that it progressively thinks more and more in accordance with its reason, and wills more and more in harmony with its freedom.</p><p>[2] People know that a love for the opposite sex follows the commencement of a youth's own intellect and develops in accordance with its force - evidence that that love ascends as the intellect ascends, and descends as the intellect descends. By its ascending we mean an ascent into wisdom; and by its descending we mean a descent into madness. It is wisdom to restrain one's love for the opposite sex, and madness to let it go unchecked. If it is let go into fornication, which is the first stage in its activity, it ought to be controlled in accordance with principles of honor and morality, principles which have been implanted in the memory and from that in the reason, and which afterwards should be implanted in the reason and from that in the memory.<p>As for the observation that, with the commencement of a youth's own intellect, the sound of his voice also begins to become manly, the reason is that it is his intellect which thinks and which through thought speaks - evidence that it is the intellect which makes the man and also his masculinity; consequently, that according as his intellect is elevated, so does he become a human man and also a manly man (see above, nos. <a href="432.htm">432</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #446 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>446. 2. Love of the other sex, which fornication comes from, begins when a growing boy starts to think and act from his own understanding and his voice starts to become manly. This is brought up in order to make the beginning of love for the other sex, and therefore of fornication, known - which is when the intellect begins to be rational on its own, or to look around from its own rationality and foresee what things are profitable and useful. Things remembered from parents and teachers serve as a basis for this.<p>A change takes place in the mind at that time. Before, it only thought from things committed to memory, thinking about them and obeying them, then by reasoning about them. Then, with love leading, it arranges things fixed in the memory into a new order and undertakes a life of its own consistent with this order, thinks more and more according to its own reason and wills from its own freedom.<p>It is well known that love for the other sex accompanies the entrance of your own intellect and advances in keeping with its vigor - a sign that this love ascends as intellect ascends and declines as it declines. By "ascend" understand ascend to wisdom, and by "decline" decline to folly. Wisdom is to manage love for the other sex, and folly is to let it run wild. If set free in fornication, which is a beginning of its activity, it should be governed on the principles of respectability and morality that are implanted in memory and from that in reason, and later implanted in reason and from that in memory.<p>The reason why your voice begins to become manly at the same time that your own intellect begins is that intellect thinks, and it speaks from thought - a sign that intellect makes the man and also his manliness, so that as intellect is elevated it makes the person a man and also a manly man (see nos. <a href="432.htm">432-433</a>, above). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #446 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>446. II. THAT LOVE OF THE SEX, FROM WHICH IS FORNICATION, COMMENCES WHEN A YOUTH BEGINS TO THINK AND ACT FROM HIS OWN UNDERSTANDING, AND HIS SPEAKING VOICE BEGINS TO BECOME MASCULINE. This is adduced to the end that it may be known that love of the sex and thence fornication has its rise when the understanding commences to become rational of itself, that is, from its own reason to discern and look out for things which shall be advantageous and useful. That which is in the memory from parents and masters then serves it as a plane. At this time a turning takes place in the mind. Prior to this, the boy has thought only from things introduced into the memory, meditating on them and obeying them. After it, he thinks of them from reason; and then, under the leadership of his love, he disposes the things seated in his memory into a new order and begins a life of his own in conformity therewith, gradually thinking more and more according to his own reason, and willing from his own freedom.<p>That love of the sex follows the initiament of a man's understanding, and progresses according to its vigor, is known; and it is a sign that the love ascends and descends as the understanding ascends and descends. By ascending is meant ascending into Wisdom, and by descending, descending into insanity, it being Wisdom to restrain love of the sex, and insanity to let it go forth broadcast. If it go forth into fornication, which is the beginning of its activity, then, from principles of honor and morality implanted in his memory and thence in his reason, and afterwards in his reason and thence in his memory, it behooves the man to restrain it.<p>That with the beginning of a man's understanding his voice also begins to become masculine, is because the understanding thinks, and it is by means of thought that it speaks. This is a sign that the understanding makes the man and also his masculinity; consequently, that as his understanding is elevated, he becomes a male man and also a masculine man; see above (nos. <a href="433.htm">433</a>,<a href="444.htm">444</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #446 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>446. (ii) Love for the sex, from which is fornication, commences when an adolescent begins to think and act from his own understanding, and his voice begins to turn masculine. We cite this to the end that the rise of sexual love and hence of fornication may be known. Love for the sex commences as the understanding begins to become rational or from its own reason to see and provide what is of advantage and use; to this all which is retained in the memory from parents and teachers serves as a plane. At that time a change takes place in the mind. Previously the adolescent had thought only from things impressed on his memory, noting and heeding them; but now he thinks from reasoning on them, and is prompted to dispose the content of the memory into a new order. Agreeably with this order, he begins to live a life of his own, gradually thinking more and more from his own reason, and willing more and more in a freedom of his own. As is known, love for the sex attends on these beginnings of one's own understanding and advances according to the understanding's vigor - an indication that this love ascends as the understanding ascends or descends as the understanding descends. Ascending means into wisdom, and descending into insanity. It is wisdom to constrain sexual love, and insanity to let it go unchecked. If it is allowed to issue in fornication, which is its first activity, principles of honesty and morality implanted in the memory and thence in the reason, and principles to be implanted in the reason and thence in the memory, ought to control it. The voice also begins to turn masculine at the time that understanding of one's own begins, for the reason that it is the understanding which thinks and through thought speaks - an indication that the understanding makes the man and also makes his masculinity; consequently that as his understanding is elevated, he becomes a human being and also a manly man (see above, n. <a href="433.htm">433-434</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #446 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>446. (2) That the love of the sex, from which is fornication, has its beginning when a youth begins to think and act from his own understanding, and the voice of his speech begins to become masculine. This is adduced to the end that the rise of the love of sex and thence of fornication may be known, that it is when the understanding begins of itself to become rational, or begins of its own reason to look and provide such things as are of emolument and of use, whereto what is in the memory, from parents and masters, then serves as a plane. At that time a change in the mind takes place. Before, he only thought from things carried in the memory, meditating upon and obeying them; afterwards, from reasoning upon them; and then, love leading, he disposes the things seated in his memory into a new order, and conformably to this order begins his own life, and successively more and more thinks according to his own reason, and wills from his own freedom. That the love of the sex follows this beginning of his own understanding, and progresses according to the vigor of it, is known; an indication that this love ascends as the understanding ascends and descends as that descends. By ascends is meant into wisdom; and by descends is meant into insanity. And it is wisdom to restrain the love of the sex; and insanity to let it loose. If it is let forth into fornication, which is a beginning of its activity, then, from principles of honor and of morality implanted in the memory and thence in the reason, and to be implanted afterwards in reason and thence in the memory, it ought to be moderated. The reason why, together with the beginning of his own understanding, the voice also begins to become masculine is, that the understanding thinks and through the thought speaks, an indication that the understanding makes the man (vir), and also makes his masculine; consequently, that in so far as his understanding is elevated he thus becomes a man-man (homo vir) and also a masculine man (vir). (See above at n. <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="434.htm">434</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #446 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>446. II. Quod Amor sexus, ex quo est fornicatio, inchoet cum adolescens ex proprio intellectu incipit cogitare et agere, ac vox loquelae ejus incipit fieri masculina. Hoc adducitur ob finem, ut sciatur ortus amoris sexus et inde fornicationis, quod sit dum intellectus inchoat ex se rationalis fieri, seu ex propria ratione perspicere et prospicere quae emolumento et usui sunt, cui tunc pro plano inservit id quod in memoria est ex parentibus et magistris: fit illo tempore versura in mente; prius modo cogitavit ex rebus memoriae illatis, meditando illa, et obediendo illis; postea ex ratione super illa; et tunc, ducente amore, disponit res memoriae insidentes in novum ordinem, et huic congrue vitam propriam orditur, et successive plus et plus secundum suam rationem cogitat, et ex suo libero vult.</p><p>[2] Quod amor sexus sequatur initiamentum intellectus proprii, et progrediatur <sup>1</sup>secundum ejus vigorem, notum est; indicium, quod ille amor ascendat, sicut ascendit intellectus, et quod descendat sicut ille descendit; per ascendere intelligitur in sapientiam, et per descendere intelligitur in insaniam; ac sapientia est amorem sexus cohibere, ac insania est illum emittere in latum; si in fornicationem, quae ejus activitatis initium est, illam ex principiis honestatis et moralitatis, memoriae et inde rationi implantatis, et postea rationi et inde memoriae implantandis, debet moderari.
