<h4 align="center"></h4><p>450、⑸对某些男人来说，若彻底受到抑制，无法在淫行中得以发泄，两性情爱不可能不造成伤害。就那些因性欲过盛而欲火中烧的人而言，列举因过于压制两性情爱而导致和造成的伤害是没有用的。对这种男人来说，这有可能会引发某些身体疾病和心理问题，更不用说那些甚至还未命名的秘密罪恶。那些两性情爱极其淡薄，因而能抵制它的欲望驱使之人则迥然不同；同样，那些刚刚成年，因而在征兆初现时就自由步入合法的同居关系，无需损失任何世俗财产的人也迥然不同。这就是天堂的婴孩到了适婚年龄时的情形；因此，他们不知道何为淫行。但这种条件在人世间并不具备，因为在世上，直等到青春年少都过去了，婚姻才提上日程。这是各国常见的情形，人们必须先工作一段时间，找到养家糊口的门路后，才有可能追求心仪的妻子。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>450、（5）不必列举对异性的爱受到过分限制所给男人带来的影响。因为男人生来就是性欲强烈的。若那样会产生身体或头脑的疾病。而那些对异性的爱相比之下弱些的人的情况却是不同的，他们能控制情欲，那些年轻轻就结婚的人就更不会有这方面的问题了。后一种情况就是那些在天国中长大的小孩子的情况，他们是不知道什么是婚前放荡性行为的。但是，世间的情况却不同，人往往要在一定年龄有了地位和经济能力之后才能有婚姻，找到合适的妻子。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #450 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>450. (v) In certain cases sexual love cannot without damage be completely prevented from being expressed in fornication.<p>It is useless to list the damage that can be caused and effected by too strict a repression of sexual love in the case of those who are troubled with a superabundance of sexual drive. In their case this may be the cause of certain bodily ailments and mental problems, not to speak of the unrecognised evils which may not even be named. It is quite different in the case of those whose sexual love is so weak that they can resist the strains of its lust; and equally so with those who are free while still youthful to enter into legitimate cohabitation without the waste of worldly wealth, so at the first outset. Since this is what happens in heaven when children have reached marriageable age, no one there knows what fornication is. But things are different on earth, where marriages cannot take place except once the period of youth is over, as often happens in kingdoms where there is a long period of obligatory duties, and the means of keeping a house and family have to be earned; only then is it possible to court a worthy bride. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #450 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>450. 5. In some men a love for the opposite sex cannot, without harmful effects, be totally restrained from going out into fornication. There is no point recounting the harmful effects which an excessive restraint of love for the opposite sex can cause and inflict in men who struggle with sexual heat owing to an inordinate sexual abundance. In their case it gives rise to the origins of certain physical maladies and mental illnesses, not to mention little-known evils which are too unspeakable to be named. It is different with those whose love for the opposite sex is moderate enough that they can resist the urges of its lust; likewise with those who at a youthful age, without any loss of worldly fortunes, thus at the first opportunity, have the freedom to introduce themselves into a legitimate companionship of the bed. Since the latter is what happens with little children in heaven when they grow up to a marriageable age, therefore they do not know there what fornication is. However, the situation is not the same on earth, where marriages cannot be contracted until past early manhood - as is the case for many in government service, where positions must be earned over a period of time and the means acquired for supporting a home and family before they can for the first time seek a suitable wife. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #450 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>450. 5. In some people, love for the other sex cannot quite be kept from escaping into fornication - not without harm. There is no point in listing the bad effects that too much restraint of love for the other sex can cause and bring about in those who have to live with sexual arousal due to excessive potency. Certain physical afflictions in them spring from it, and moodiness, not to mention strange, unmentionable offenses.<p>It is different for those who have little enough sex drive to resist the pressures of what it wants. The same goes for those who are free to begin a legitimate bedroom relationship at a young age without loss of worldly goods - in a virgin marriage, that is. Since this happens for children in heaven when they reach an age to marry, they do not know what fornication is there. But the situation is not the same on earth, where people cannot marry until their youth is past. This happens to many under governments where it takes a long time to be entitled to work, to obtain the means to support a home and family, and then at last to seek a suitable wife. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #450 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>450. V. THAT WITH SOME MEN, LOVE OF THE SEX CANNOT WITHOUT HARMFUL RESULTS BE TOTALLY RESTRAINED FROM GOING FORTH INTO FORNICATION. It were vain to recount the harmful results which excessive repression of love of the sex may cause and effect with those who from superabundance labor with burning heat. With such men, this gives rise to certain diseases of the body and sicknesses of the mind, to say nothing of secret evils which are not to be named. It is otherwise with those whose love of the sex is so scanty that they are able to resist the urgings of its lust; and likewise with those who at the age of early manhood, thus at the first omens, are free to introduce themselves into a legitimate partnership of the bed without any loss of worldly fortune. This is the case with infants in heaven when they have grown to marriageable age; therefore, they do not know what fornication is. The same condition does not obtain on earth where matrimonies cannot be contracted until early manhood has passed. This is the case with many in governments where offices must be earned by long service and means must be acquired to support a house and family, it being only then that a worthy wife can be sought. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #450 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>450. (v) In some men love for the sex cannot without damage be totally restrained from issuing in fornication. It is idle to recite the damage which excessive restraint of sexual love can cause and work with those who from superabundance labor with burning heat. Thence originate with these men certain bodily sicknesses and mental disorders, to say nothing of unmentionable secret evils. It is different with those whose sexual love is moderate enough to enable them to resist the urgings of its lust; also with those who in early manhood and thus at the first omens are free to introduce themselves without loss of worldly fortune into a legitimate partnership of the bed. As this is the case with children in heaven when they grow up to marriageable age, it is unknown there what fornication is. But the situation is not the same on earth where marriages cannot be contracted until youth is past, as is often the case under governments where positions must be waited for and the means acquired for maintaining a home and family, before a worthy wife can be courted. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #450 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>450. (5) That with some men the love of the sex cannot without harm be totally restrained from going forth into fornication. There is no need to recount the injuries which excessive restraint of the love of the sex may cause and effect with those who from superabundance suffer from intense venereal excitement. Hence are the origins with them of certain diseases of the body and disorders of the mind, to say nothing of unknown evils not to be named. It is different with those whose love of the sex is so scanty that they are able to resist the urgings of its lust. Equally so with those who at the age of early manhood, thus at the first favorable opportunity, are free, without the loss of worldly fortune, to introduce themselves to a legitimate partnership of the bed. As it is so in heaven with infants when they are grown to conjugial age, it is unknown there what fornication is. But on earth the case is not the same in places where marriages cannot be contracted until after the time of early manhood is past; which is so with many in governments where offices are obtained, and the means for supporting a house and family are acquired by long service, and then first can a worthy wife be sought. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #450 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>450. V. Quod amor sexus, quin exeat in fornicationem, apud quosdam sine damnis non possit in totum coerceri. In vanum est recensere damna, quae nimia coercitio amoris sexus, apud illos, qui ex superabundantia laborant oestro, causari et operari potest; apud hos inde sunt origines quorundam morborum corporis, et aegritudinum mentis, ut conticeantur mala incognita, quae non nominanda; aliter apud illos, quibus tam parcus amor sexus est, ut nisibus ejus libidinis possint resistere; pariter apud illos, quibus in juvenescente aetate absque dispendiis fortunarum Mundi, ita primis ominibus, in legitimum consortium tori, liberum est se introducere: quoniam ita fit in coelo cum infantibus cum ad aetatem conjugialem adoleverunt, ideo nescitur ibi quid fornicatio; sed in terris non similis res est, ubi matrimonia non possunt contrahi nisi quam post exactam juventutem, quod fit pluribus intra regimina, ubi officia diu merenda sunt, et acquirendae facultates pro sustentanda domo et familia, et tunc primum digna uxor ambienda. </p>
