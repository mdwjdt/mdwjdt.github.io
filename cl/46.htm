<h4 align="center"></h4><p>46、⑴死后，人皆保持两性情爱，这爱正如它内在的样子，也就是说，如在世时它存在于人的内在思维和意愿中的样子。死后，人所有的爱都会伴随着他，因为爱是他生命的存在。作为首领的主导爱，连同其附属之爱，将永远留在人内。这些爱之所以保留下来，是因为爱就是人里面的灵之情感，并通过灵在身体中被感觉到。由于人死后会成为一个灵，所以他会携带自己的爱。此外，爱是人生命的存在，故显而易见，在世时人的生命如何，其死后的命运就如何。至于两性情爱，它普遍存在于所有人里面，因为自创世的那一刻起，它就被植入人的灵魂，由此产生人的全部特质，这是为了繁衍人类。这爱被特别保留下来，因为死后，男性还是男性，女性还是女性。在男性里面，灵魂（soul）、心智（mind）或身体中没有一物不具有男性特质，在女性里面，则没有一物不具有女性特质。两性如此受造是为了努力结合，事实上，是为了他们能合而为一。这种努力就是先于婚姻之爱的两性情爱。由于结合的倾向被刻在男性和女性的一切元素中，故可知，这种倾向不会因身体而被抹去和消失。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>46、（1）每个人死后对异性的爱在内在上是一样的。也就是说，与这个人在世间时所思所想的一样。每个人的爱在死后还伴随着他，因为爱是他生命的内在。他的最主要的爱统领其它的爱，将与该人永远相伴。其它的将处于从属地位。这些爱之所以存在是因为爱是精神的一种感受，爱因为有精神的存在而被躯体感觉到。因为人在死后变成了精神，所以他的爱还与在世间时一样。</p><p>至于对异性的爱，它是存在于一切人之中的，因为在创世时起它就被根植在人的灵魂之中。由此而产生一个人整体的性质。这种爱是为了人类的繁延而存在的。这种爱在人死后仍然存在，是因为男人在灵魂、思想及躯体上还是男人，女人在灵魂、思想、躯体上还是女人。男女两性为了相互结合而存在，相互结合而合二为一。这种对异性的爱是以婚姻之爱而存在。</p><p>因为相互结合的倾向深刻于男女之中，所以这种倾向不会因为死亡而消失。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #46 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>46. (i) Everyone retains his sexual love after death, exactly as it was inwardly; that is, as it was inwardly in his thought and will while in the world.<p>Every love accompanies a person after death, because it is the essence of his life; and the dominant love, the chief of all, lasts for ever in a person, together with the subordinate loves. The reason is that love is properly a function of a person's spirit, reaching the body from the spirit. Since after death a person becomes a spirit, he brings his love with him. Since love is the essence of a person's life, it is obvious that a person's fate after death is determined by the kind of life he led in the world.<p>As regards sexual love, this is a universal feature shared by all. For it was implanted from creation in a person's soul, which is the source of the whole person's essence, as something necessary for the continuance of the human race. This love remains the chief one, because after death a man is a man and a woman is a woman; and there is nothing in the soul, mind or body which is not male in the man and female in the woman. These two have been so created as to strive to be joined, in fact to be joined into one. This striving is sexual love, which precedes conjugial love. Since then this tendency to union is stamped upon every detail of the male and the female, it follows that it cannot be wiped out and die together with the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #46 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>46. 1. In every person after death, love for the opposite sex continues to be what it was like inwardly, that is, what it was like in the person's inner will and thought in the world. All a person's love goes with him after death, because love is the inner being of his life. And the dominant love, which heads the rest, remains in a person to eternity, along with other loves subordinate to it. These loves remain, because love is properly an affection of the spirit in a person and is felt in the body from the spirit. And since a person becomes a spirit after death, he consequently carries his love with him. Moreover, since love is the inner being of a person's life, it is apparent that a person's lot after death becomes such as his life was in the world.<p>As regards love for the opposite sex, this is universal in all people, for it is implanted from the moment of creation in a person's very soul, from which comes the essential nature of the whole person, and it is implanted for the sake of propagating the human race. This love remains especially, because after death a man is still a man, and a woman is still a woman, and there is nothing in the soul, mind, or body which is not masculine in the male and feminine in the female; and the two sexes have been so created as to strive for conjunction, indeed, for conjunction in order that they may become one. This impulse is the love for the opposite sex which precedes conjugial love.<p>Now because an inclination to conjunction has been engraved on each and every element in the male and female, it follows that this inclination cannot be wiped out or die with the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #46 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>46. 1. After death every person's sexual love stays the way it was inwardly in the world - that is, as it was in his inward desire and thought. Every love follows a person after death, because it is the essence of his life. The controlling love, which is the head of all the others, remains with the person forever, and so do the subordinate loves. They remain because a love belongs to a person's spirit and to his body from his spirit. And since a person becomes a spirit after death, he carries the love with him. Love is the essence of a person's life, so clearly whatever his life was like in the world, his condition after death is the same.<p>As for sexual love, it is the basic one of all loves, because by creation it is placed in the person's soul itself, where the person's whole essence comes from. Sexual love is there to enlarge the human race. The reason this love especially remains is that after death men are still male and women are female, and there is nothing in the soul, mind, and body that is not male in a man and female in a woman, and these two are created in such a way that they seek to be united - united into one person; in fact this urge is the sexual love that precedes the love for marriage. Now because the inclination to join is written all over each and every thing about men and women, this means that the inclination cannot be erased and die with your body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #46 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>46. I. THAT AFTER DEATH LOVE OF THE SEX REMAINS WITH EVERY MAN SUCH AS IT HAD BEEN INTERIORLY, THAT IS, IN HIS INTERIOR WILL AND THOUGHT, IN THE WORLD. Every love follows man after death, love being the esse of his life; and the ruling love, which is the head of all the rest, continues with man to eternity, and with it the subordinate loves. The reason why they continue, is because love pertains properly to man's spirit, and to his body from the spirit; and after death man becomes a spirit and so carries his love with him. And because love is the esse of man's life, it is evident that as the man's life was in the world, such will be his lot after death.<p>As to love of the sex, this is the universal of all loves, for it is implanted by creation in man's very soul, from which is the essence of the whole man, and this for the sake of the propagation of the human race. This love especially remains because, after death, man is a man and woman a woman, and there is nothing in their soul, mind, or body which is not masculine in the male and feminine in the female. Moreover, the two have been so created that they strive for conjunction, yea, for such conjunction that they may become one. This striving is the love of the sex which precedes conjugial love. Now, because the conjunctive inclination is inscribed upon each and all things of the male and of the female, it follows that this inclination cannot be obliterated and pass away with the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #46 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>46. (i) Love for the sex continues after death with every person such as it was inwardly, that is, such as it was in the interior will and thought in the world. All one's love<p>Follows one after death, for love is the esse of man's life. The ruling love, which is the head of the rest, and subordinate loves along with it, persist with man to eternity. Loves persist because strictly they are of man's spirit, and of the body from the spirit, and after death the human being becomes a spirit, and thus takes his love with him. As love is the esse of man's life, it is plain that such as a man's life was in the world, such is his lot after death. As for sexual love, it is the universal love, having been put by creation in man's very soul, which is his whole essence, and this for the sake of the propagation of the race. This love in particular remains, because a man after death is a man and a woman a woman, and there is nothing in soul, mind or body, which is not masculine in the male and feminine in the female. The two have been so created, moreover, that they seek after conjunction, yes, to be one; this striving is the love of the sex, which precedes marital love. A conjunctive inclination which has been inscribed on each and all things of man and woman certainly cannot be blotted out and perish with the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #46 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>46. (1) That the love of the sex remains after death with, every man (Latin: homo), of such quality as it was interiorly, that is, in his interior will and thought, in the world. Every love follows man after death; for love is the esse of his life. And the ruling love, which is the head of all the rest, continues with man to eternity; and together with it the subordinate loves. The reason why they continue is that love pertains properly to man's spirit, and to his body from the spirit; and man after death is a spirit and so carries his love with him. And love, being the esse of man's life, it is plain that as the man's life was in the world such becomes his lot after death.<p>As to the love of the sex it is the universal of all loves; for it is implanted by creation in man's very soul, whence is the essence of the whole man, and this for the sake of propagating the human race. That this love especially remains, is because a man is a man after death and a woman is a woman, and because there is nothing in soul, in mind, and in body, that is not masculine in the male and feminine in the female; and these two are so created that they urgently strive for conjunction, yea, for such conjunction that they may become one. This incitement is the love of the sex which precedes conjugial love. Now, as this conjunctive inclination is inscribed upon all things, and upon every single thing of the male and of the female, it follows that this inclination cannot be obliterated and die with the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #46 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>46. I: Quod Amor sexus maneat apud omnem hominem post mortem, qualis ille interius, hoc est, in interiore ejus voluntate et cogitatione fuerat in Mundo. Omnis Amor sequitur hominem post mortem, quia est Esse vitae ejus; et Amor regnans, qui est caput reliquorum, permanet apud hominem in aeternum, et cum illo simul amores subordinati; quod permaneant, est quia Amor est proprie spiritus hominis, et est corporis a spiritu, ac homo post mortem fit spiritus, et sic amorem suum fert secum; et quia Amor est Esse vitae hominis, patet, quod qualis hominis vita fuit in Mundo, talis fiat sors ejus post mortem. Quod Amorem sexus concernit, est ille universalis omnium, nam est a creatione inditus ipsi animae hominis, ex qua totius hominis essentia est, et hoc propter Generis humani propagationem; quod hic Amor principaliter maneat, est quia post mortem vir est vir, ac foemina est foemina, et quia nihil est in anima, in mente, et in corpore, quod non est masculinum in masculo, et foemininum in foemina; et haec duo ita creata sunt, ut connitantur in conjunctionem, imo in conjunctionem ut unum fiant; hic nisus est Amor sexus, qui praecedit Amorem conjugialem: nunc quia inclinatio conjunctiva inscripta est omnibus et singulis masculi et foeminae, sequitur quod illa inclinatio non possit obliterari ac obire cum corpore. </p>
