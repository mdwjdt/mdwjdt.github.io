<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第144节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>144、⑸婚姻真爱的一切快乐，甚至最表层的快乐，都是贞洁的。这从前面的解释可推知，即“真正的婚姻之爱是贞洁本身，快乐则构成它的生命”。前面提到，婚姻之爱的快乐上升并进入天堂，全程贯穿天上的天使所体验的天堂之爱的喜乐；还提到它们如何与天使的婚姻之爱的快乐结合。此外，我从天使那里听说，当这些快乐从地上的贞洁伴侣那里上升时，天使发觉它们在自己里面得到升华，变得丰满。一些不贞洁的旁观者询问这快乐是否包括最表层的快乐，天使点头表示同意，并悄声说：“这还用问吗？它们岂不是婚姻之爱的快乐最完全的表达？”这爱之快乐的源头和性质可见于69节，以及记事，尤其是下文中的记事。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>144、（5）婚姻之爱中所有的愉悦都是贞洁的。</p><p>从前讲过这种爱的愉悦是怎样的上升并进入天国及在这一过程中的天国般的爱的快乐。我也讲过这些愉悦在天使中是如何的。另外，我还听天使们说来自于世间贞节的婚姻的愉悦会在它上升的过程中变得更完好，参见第69节。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #144 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>144. (v) All the delights of truly conjugial love, even the lowest, are chaste.<p>This follows from the explanations given above, that truly conjugial love is the height of chastity, and delights constitute its life. The delights of that love rise up and enter heaven, passing on the way through the pleasures of the heavenly loves enjoyed by angels in heaven, and they combine with the delights of their conjugial love, as was related above. I have in addition heard from angels that they feel their delights uplifted and filled out, when they rise up from chaste married couples on earth. And for the sake of the by-standers, who were unchaste, they assented to the question whether this included the lowest delights, whispering, 'Of course; are not these then at their fullest?' On the source and nature of the delights of this love see above <a href="69.htm">69</a>, and in the accounts of experiences, especially the next. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #144 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>144. 5. All the delights of truly conjugial love, even the end delights, are chaste. This follows from the foregoing considerations explaining that truly conjugial love is the essence of chastity. And delights make the life of this love.<p>I have indicated earlier how the delights of this love ascend and enter heaven, and on the way permeate the joys of heavenly loves experienced by angels of heaven. I have also recounted how these delights ally themselves with the delights of conjugial love in angels. Moreover, I have heard from angels that they perceive these delights to be heightened in them and to become fuller as they ascend from chaste married partners on earth. And in response to some bystanders, who were unchaste - in reply to their question whether they also experienced the end delights - the angels nodded and quietly said, "What else? Are they not delights of conjugial love in their fullest expression?"<p>(Regarding the source of the delights of this love and what they are like, see no. <a href="69.htm">69</a> above and what is said in the narrative accounts, especially in those that follow.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #144 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>144. 5. All the pleasures of real married love are chaste - even the most physical ones. This follows from the things explained above - that real married love is chastity itself and delights are its life, that the delights of this love ascend and enter heaven, and on the way they pass through the joys of heavenly love that the angels have in heaven, and besides, that these delights join together with the joys of the angels' married love. This was mentioned above.<p>Besides this, I have heard it from angels that they themselves find those pleasures better and fuller when they come from chaste marriages on earth. Some unchaste people were hanging around nearby. Someone asked, "Even the physical pleasures?" They nodded and said quietly, "Why not? These pleasures are the fulfillment of the others, aren't they?"<p>(Where these pleasures associated with love come from, and what they are like appears in no. 69 above and in the stories especially the ones to follow.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #144 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>144. V. THAT ALL THE DELIGHTS OF LOVE TRULY CONJUGIAL, EVEN THE ULTIMATE, ARE CHASTE. This follows from what has been explained above, namely, that love truly conjugial is chastity itself; and delights are what make its life. It has been noted above, that the delights of that love ascend and enter into heaven, and on the way pass through the joys of the heavenly loves wherein are the angels of heaven; and that they conjoin themselves with the delights of their conjugial love. Moreover, I have heard from angels, that when these delights ascend from chaste partners on earth, they perceive them to be exalted with themselves and infilled. Because of some bystanders who were unchaste, to the question as to whether this applied also to the ultimate delights, they nodded assent and said tacitly, "How can it be otherwise? are not those delights the other delights in their fullness?" The source and nature of the delights of that love may be seen above, no. <a href="69.htm">69</a>, and also in the Memorable Relations, especially in those that follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #144 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>144. (v) All the delights of true marital love, including the ultimate, are chaste. This follows from what was explained above, namely, that true marital love is chastity itself. For the delights make its life. We told above how the delights of that love ascend and enter heaven, and on the way pass through the joys of the heavenly loves in which the angels of heaven are, and also unite with the delights of the marital love of the angels. I have also heard from angels that they perceive their delights being intensified and filled when delights ascend from chaste partners on earth. When some bystanders, who were unchaste, raised the question whether ultimate delights were meant, too, they nodded and said quietly, "How can it be otherwise? Are not those delights the delights of marital love in their fullness?" See above, n.<a href="69.htm">69</a>, and in the Memorabilia, especially in the next following, on the source and nature of the delights of marital love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #144 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>144. (5) That all the delights of love truly conjugial even the ultimate, are chaste. This follows from what has been shown above, that love truly conjugial is chastity itself, and the delights constitute the life of it. That the delights of that love ascend to heaven and enter it, and on the way pass through the joys of the heavenly loves in which the angels of heaven are; so also that they conjoin themselves with the delights of their conjugial love, has been mentioned above. Moreover, I have heard from the angels that they perceive those delights within themselves to be exalted and filled when they ascend from chaste married partners on earth. And, on account of some that were standing by who were unchaste, to the question, whether they meant also the ultimate delights? They nodded assent, and said tacitly, 'Why not? Are not these delights those in their fulness?' From whence these delights are, and of what quality they are, may be seen above in n. 69, and in the Relations, especially in those that follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #144 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>144. V: Quod omnes delitiae Amoris vere conjugialis, etiam ultimae, sint castae. Hoc sequitur a supra explicatis, quod Amor vere conjugialis sit ipsa castitas, ac delitiae vitam illius faciunt: quod Delitiae illius amoris ascendant ac intrent Coelum, et in via pertranseant jucunda amorum coelestium, in quibus sunt Angeli Coeli; tum quod se cum Delitiis amoris conjugialis illorum conjungant, supra memoratum est. Insuper ab Angelis auditum est, quod percipiant delitias illas apud se exaltari et impleri, dum ascendunt ex conjugibus castis in terris; et propter adstantes, qui incasti erant, ad quaestionem num etiam delitiae ultimae, annuebant, et dicebant tacite, quid aliter, suntne hae illae in sua plenitudine. Unde illius amoris delitiae sunt, et quales, videantur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_144/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_69" target=_top>69</a>; et in Memorabilibus, imprimis in sequentibus. </p>
