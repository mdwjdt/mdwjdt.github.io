The spiritual virtues men possess are a love of religion, charity, truth, faith, conscience, innocence, and many more. Both these classes of virtues can in general be ascribed to love and zeal for religion, for the public good, for one's country, for one's fellow citizens, for one's parents, for one's wife and children. In all these justice and judgment play the leading part; justice is a matter of moral wisdom, judgment of rational wisdom. </p>
