<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第二十四章  强奸的淫欲</h4><p>511、强奸的淫欲不是指奸污处女的淫欲。后一种淫欲是对贞操的强奸，但只要对方同意，就不是对处女的强奸。而此处所说的强奸淫欲会因同意而退缩，因拒绝而加剧。它是强奸完全拒绝、激烈反抗的女人的一种强烈性欲，无论这个女人是处女、寡妇还是妻子。这些男人就像土匪或海盗，以抢劫和掠夺为快乐，而不是以礼物或合法获得的东西为快乐。他们还像犯罪分子，只热衷于非法、违禁之物，唾弃合法、许可之物。这些强奸犯完全憎恶同意，并因抵抗而变得火热。如果他们看不到有内在的抵抗，其淫欲的激情就立刻熄灭，如同被水浇灭的火。众所周知，就爱情最表层的效果而言，妻子不会自动顺从丈夫的意志，而是会出于谨慎进行抵抗，仿佛抵抗强奸，以此驱散丈夫的冷淡；这种冷淡是由不断许可，以及对这些事的淫秽思想产生的。这些抵抗尽管会点燃丈夫，但并不是这种淫欲的原因，仅仅是它的开始。它的原因在于，当婚姻之爱，以及淫乱之爱通过他们的运用而变得不再新鲜时，为使它们得以恢复，它们必须通过完全抵抗而被点燃。如此开始的淫欲后来继续增长，并且随着增长，它鄙视并突破两性情爱的一切限制，从而放逐自己。然后，它从一种淫荡、身体和肉欲之爱，变成一种软骨和骨质的爱，并由于享有敏锐感受力的骨膜而变得灵敏。然而，这种淫欲很少见，只存在于那些步入婚姻后沉溺于淫行，直到这些行为丧失吸引力的人当中。除了这种淫欲的属世原因外，它还有一个属灵的原因，对此，下文会有说明。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">强奸的情欲</h4><p>511、这里所讲的强奸与诱奸不同。诱奸是对处女贞操的侵犯，是在女方同意的情况下发生的。而强奸却没有经得同意。另外，强奸是对任何女人的侵犯，不论她们是处女，是寡妇还是别人的妻子。这种人象强盗一样会从抢来的东西中得到快乐。他们喜欢非法的，不被允许的东西而排斥合法的东西。</p><p>这种侵犯者不喜欢服从而喜欢被抵制，若他们感觉到对方的抵制不是发自内心的，他们会象是烈火上被浇了水一样，会感到扫兴。</p><p>人们知道有些做妻子的会故意拒绝丈夫，这是她们在通过拒绝而引发丈夫们的兴趣，来调节平淡的婚姻关系。</p><p>这种表演性的抵制尽管能起到刺激作用，但却不能产生强奸的情欲。有强奸情欲的男人希望受到绝对的拒绝。</p><p>这样的情欲会开始并成长，直到最后发展到超过了对异性的爱的限度，变得赤裸裸。</p><p>然而这种情意况不多的，它只会发生在那些在婚姻之中，后来又有婚外情的人中。</p><p>除了自然的原因外，这种情欲还有其产生的精神的原因。我们将在以后讲到。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #511 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>511. XXIV. THE LUST FOR RAPE<p>The lust for rape does not mean the lust for deflowering virgins. That lust is the rape of virginities, but not of virgins, so long as it takes place with their consent. The lust for rape meant here recoils from consent and is exacerbated by its absence. It is an ardent desire to rape women of any sort who are utterly unwilling and reject their advances, whether they are virgins, widows or wives. These men are like brigands or pirates who take delight in their seizures and plunder, but not in what is given them or is fairly acquired. They are like criminals who are agog for what is unlawful and forbidden, and spurn what is lawful and permitted.<p>These rapists completely turn their backs on consent and are fired by resistance. If they do not observe any inward resistance, the ardour of their lust is at once quenched, like a fire dowsed with water. It is well known that wives do not of their own accord submit to their husbands' wishes as regards the outermost expressions of love, and their prudence makes them offer resistance, as if to rape, to take away from their husbands the coldness which arises from constant permission and also from having wanton thoughts about these matters. Although resistance of this kind inflames their husbands, it is not the reason, but only the beginning of their lust. The reason is that, once conjugial love and also scortatory love have faded as the result of being exercised, to be revived they need to be inflamed by complete resistance.<p>The lust so begun goes on to grow, and as it grows, it despises and breaks through all the restrictions on sexual love, so banishing itself, and from a wanton bodily and fleshly love it becomes one of cartilage and bone, and then as the result of the regions near the bone which have acute sensitivity, it becomes acute. However, this lust is still rare, because it is only possible with those who have entered upon marriage and then so much indulged in affairs, that these have become unattractive. In addition to the natural reason for this lust, there also exists a spiritual reason, about which something will be said in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #511 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>511. THE LUST TO RAPE<p>By the lust to rape we do not mean the lust to deflower. The lust to deflower is a violation of virgins' virginity, but not of the virgins themselves when it is done with their consent. In contrast, the lust to rape which we take up here recedes in the face of consent and is intensified by refusal. Moreover it is an impulsion to violate any women whatever who absolutely refuse and vehemently resist, whether they are virgins, widows or wives. Such men are like highwaymen and pirates who take delight in goods seized and plundered and not in ones given and justly acquired. They are also like malefactors who pant after things unlawful and forbidden and spurn those which are lawful and allowed.<p>These violators of women utterly dislike consent and are inflamed by resistance; and if they observe that the resistance is not an internal one, the heat of their lust is, like a fire doused with water, immediately extinguished.<p>People know that some wives do not automatically submit themselves to their husbands' determinations in regard to the outmost expressions of love, but that they are led by their prudence to put up a show of resistance, as though to acts of violation, in order to expel from their husbands any coldness arising from its ordinariness in consequence of its being continually allowed, and also any coldness arising from a lascivious idea of them as women.<p>These shows of resistance, however, even though they arouse, still do not cause this lust but are only introductory to it. The cause of the lust comes after conjugial love and likewise licentious love have become, through exercises of them, stale, when in order to be reinvigorated the men wish to be set on fire by absolute efforts at resistance.<p>This lust thus begun, afterwards grows, and as it grows, it disdains and bursts through all the limits of a love for the opposite sex and exiles itself from them, so that from being a lascivious, carnal and fleshly love it becomes a cartilaginous and bony one; and then, from the periostea, which possess an acute sensibility, it becomes acute.<p>Still, however, this lust is rare, because it occurs only in those who have entered into marriage and afterward engaged in licentious affairs until these have become stale.<p>In addition to this natural cause, this lust has also a spiritual cause, which we will say something about later on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #511 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>511. Chapter 24. Lust for Rape<p>Lust for rape does not mean lust for defloration. Lust for defloration is lust to violate virginity, not the virgins, when it is done with consent. But the lust for rape this chapter is about is turned off by consent and is excited by a protest. It is a burning desire to violate any women who flatly refuse and violently resist virgins, widows, or wives. Rapists are like thieves and pirates who delight in plunder and spoils, not gifts and honest gains.<p>And they are like criminals who stare at unlawful and forbidden things greedily and despise things that are permissible and lawful.<p>These rapists are totally turned off by consent and are set afire by resistance. If they notice that it is surface resistance, the flame of their lust goes out at once, like a fire with water thrown on it.<p>It is well known that wives do not submit willingly to their husbands' will when it comes to the physical acts of love, and that they prudently resist them like violations, in order to take away from their husbands the coldness that comes from something that is routine and always allowed, and also from a notion about these things being lascivious. Though these protests do inflame, they are not the cause of the present lust but are only what starts it up. The cause of it is that after married love, and also illicit love, are worn out from use, rapists like to be set afire by complete resistance in order to recover.<p>This lust, begun in this way, then grows, and as it grows it scorns and breaks all limits of love for the other sex, exterminates itself, and changes from a wanton physical and fleshly love into one like cartilage and bone. And then, due to the membrane on bone, which is acutely sensitive, it becomes violent.<p>But yet this lust is rare, because it only occurs in those who have entered marriage and then indulged in illicit sex until it has worn them out.<p>Besides this worldly cause of this lust there is also a spiritual cause. Something will be said about it in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #511 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>511. THE LUST OF VIOLATION<p>By the lust of violation is not meant the lust of defloration. The latter lust is the violation of virginities, but not the violation of virgins when done without their consent; <sup >1</sup>but the lust of violation here treated of recedes in consequence of consent, and is sharpened by refusal. It is a burning desire to violate any woman, whether virgin, widow, or wife, who absolutely refuses and resists with violence. These violators are like robbers and pirates who delight in rapine and spoils, and not in gifts and things justly acquired; and like malefactors who are eager for things unlawful and forbidden, and spurn things lawful and conceded. They are utterly averse to consent, and are inflamed by resistance; and if they observe that it is not an inner resistance, the ardor of their lust is instantly extinguished, like fire by water thrown upon it.<p>As regards the ultimate effects of love, it is known that wives do not submit themselves spontaneously to the will of their husbands, and that from prudence they offer resistance as though to violation, and this to the end that they may remove from their husbands the cold arising from commonness, by reason of its being continually allowed, and arising also from an idea of lasciviousness with respect to such things. Yet these resistances, although they enkindle, are not the causes of this lust but only its initiaments. Its cause is, that when conjugial love and also scortatory love become worn out by exercise, then, in order that they may be restored, they wish to be set on fire by absolute resistance. The lust thus begun afterwards increases, and as it increases it spurns and breaks down all the limits of love of the sex and exterminates itself. Then, from being a lascivious, corporeal, and carnal love, it becomes cartilaginous and bony, and becomes acute from the periostea which enjoy acute sensibility. This lust, however, is rare, existing only with those who have entered into marriage and then indulged in whoredoms until these became worn out. In addition to this natural cause of the lust, there is also a spiritual cause, of which something shall be said in what follows.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin is dum fit ex consensu at libido violationis, etc. (when done from consent, but the lust of violation, etc.). The context clearly shows that this ought to be dum fit, absque consensu, as in the translation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #511 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>511. XXIII. THE LUST OF VIOLATION<p>The lust of violation does not mean the lust of defloration. It is a violation of virginities, but not of virgins when it is done with consent. The lust of violation now under discussion subsides at consent and is excited by refusal; it is the passion for violating women who utterly refuse and forcibly resist, whether they are virgins, widows or wives. Men in this lust are like robbers and pirates who delight in rapine and spoils, and not in gifts and things justly acquired; and like malefactors who pant after the illicit and forbidden and disdain the licit and conceded. These violators are repelled by consent and impassioned by resistance. If they notice that the resistance is not meant, the ardor of their lust is at once extinguished, like a fire by water thrown on it.<p>It is known that wives do not submit themselves freely to their husbands' wills in the ultimate acts of love, and that from prudence they offer resistance as if to violations in order to remove from the husbands the cold which arises from what is common because regularly permitted, and which also arises from lascivious ideas about such things.<p>These resistances, however, though they enkindle, are not the cause but only the beginnings of this lust. The cause of it is that marital love and scortatory love also, having become spent by exercise, wish to be fired by outright resistance in order to be restored. So begun, this lust grows, and as it grows, spurns and bursts all the limits of love for the sex and destroys itself. From a lascivious bodily and carnal love, it becomes a cartilaginous and bony one, and then from the periostea, which enjoy acute sensibility, it becomes acute. This lust is rare, however, existing only with those who have entered marriage and then have practiced whoredom until this has staled. Besides this natural cause for the lust there is a spiritual one, too, of which something shall be said in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #511 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>511. ON THE LUST OF VIOLATION.<p>By the lust of violation is not meant the lust of defloration. This lust is for the violation of virginities, but not of virgins when it is done by consent. But the lust of violation here treated of draws back from consent, and is intensified by refusal. In fact, it is a passion for violating whatsoever women entirely refuse and violently resist, whether virgins or widows or wives. They are like robbers and pirates who delight in rapine and spoils, and not in gifts or things justly acquired; and like malefactors who are eager for unlawful and forbidden things, and spurn those that are lawful and permitted. These violators are utterly averse to consent, and are impassioned by repugnance, which if they observe not to be internal, the ardor of their lust is instantly quenched, as a fire by water thrown upon it.<p>It is known that wives do not submit themselves spontaneously to the will of their husbands in respect to the ultimate acts of love; and that from prudence they offer resistance, as if to violations, to the end that they may ward off from their husbands the cold springing from what is common because continually allowable, and springing also from an idea of the lascivious with respect to them.<p>Yet these repugnancies, although they inflame, are not the cause but only the beginnings of this lust. The reason of it is, that after conjugial love, and also scortatory love, have become spent by practice, they like to be kindled by absolute refusals, that they may recover. The lust thus begun increases afterwards, and as it increases it spurns and breaks all bounds of the love of the sex and exterminates itself, and from a lascivious, corporeal, and fleshly love it becomes cartilaginous and bony; and then, from the periostea which have acute sensibility, it becomes acute. But yet this lust is rare, because it exists only with those who have entered into marriage and then indulged in scortations until they became spent. Besides this natural cause of that lust there is yet a spiritual cause, of which something is to be said in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #511 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>511. De Libidine Violationis <p>Per Libidinem violationis non intelligitur Libido deflorationis; haec libido est violatio virginitatum, non autem virginum, dum fit ex consensu; at Libido violationis, de qua hic agitur, recedit ex consensu, et exasperatur ex dissensu; et est ardor violandi foeminas quascunque, quae prorsus renuunt, et violenter renituntur; sive sint virgines, sive viduae, sive uxores; sunt sicut latrones et piratae, qui delectantur raptis et praedatis, et non donatis et juste acquisitis; et sunt sicut malefactores, qui inhiant illicitis et vetitis, et aspernantur licita et concessa: violatores hi prorsus aversantur consensum, et exardescunt ex repugnantia, quam si non internam animadvertunt, illico libidinis illorum ardor, sicut ignis ex injecta aqua, exstinguitur. Notum est, quod uxores non ex spontaneo se arbitriis maritorum suorum quoad effectus amoris ultimos submittant, et quod ex prudentia repugnent sicut ad violationes, propter finem ut auferant maritis frigus a communi ex jugi licito, et quoque ex idea lasciviae de illis, oriundum: et hae repugnantiae, tametsi accendunt, usque non sunt causae, sed modo sunt initia hujus libidinis: causa ejus est, quod postquam amor conjugialis, et quoque amor scortatorius per exercitia, obsoleverunt, ut reparentur, velint ignescere per absolutas repugnantias: haec Libido ita incepta crescit postea, et sicut crescit, omnes limites amoris sexus spernit et rumpit, et exterminat se, et ab amore lascivo corporeo et carneo fit cartilagineus et osseus, et tunc ex periosteis, quae sensu acuto gaudent, fit acutus. Sed usque haec libido rara est, quia non datur nisi apud illos, qui conjugium iniverant, et tunc scortationes, usque dum obsoletae factae sunt, exercuerant: praeter hanc naturalem causam hujus libidinis, datur etiam causa spiritualis, de qua aliquid in sequentibus. </p>
