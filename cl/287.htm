<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #287 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>287. (xvi) They are intended to ensure the various marks of good will looked for by the partner, or his or her relatives, and also to allay fears of losing these.<p>This happens especially in the case of marriages between couples who are of different rank and condition (on which <a href="250.htm">250</a> above). For instance, when a man marries a wealthy wife, and she hoards her cash in purses or her treasures in safe deposits; even more so, if she boldly insists that it is her husband's duty to maintain the household out of his own resources and income. It is common knowledge that this results in a forced pretence of a kind of conjugial love. The results are similar when he marries a wife, whose parents, relatives and friends hold high office, have profitable trading interests or are engaged in commerce, so that they can arrange for her to be better off. It is generally known that this situation too leads to the pretence of a kind of conjugial love. It is obvious that both of these cases are due to the fear of losing these advantages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #287 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>287. 16. They are adopted for the sake of various benefits expected from the partner or from the partner's relatives, and thus because of a fear of losing them. This happens primarily in marriages in which the partners are of dissimilar station and condition, on which subject see no. <a href="250.htm">250</a> above. Such a circumstance exists, for example, when a man marries a wealthy wife, and she stashes away her money in moneybags or her valuables in securities; and still more if she boldly insists that it is the husband's duty to maintain the household out of his income and earnings. It is common knowledge that semblances and seeming displays of conjugial love are compelled as a result.<p>Similar circumstances exist when a man marries a wife whose parents, relatives and friends are established in high positions, in profitable businesses or in commercial operations, who are able to exercise control over her more fortunate condition. It is common knowledge that simulations and seeming displays of conjugial love are adopted on these accounts as well.<p>In cases like this in which various benefits are expected, it is obvious that these semblances and simulations are adopted because of a fear of losing them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #287 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>287. 16. Pretenses are for the sake of various favors expected from the married partner or the in - laws and for fear of losing these. This happens particularly in marriages of mixed class and condition (see no. <a href="250.htm">250</a>, above), for example, when a man marries a wealthy wife and she hides her money away or invests her wealth - or worse, if she boldly insists that her husband owes it to her to support the household from his own property and income. Everyone knows that this necessitates imitations of married love. It is also common knowledge that the same thing happens when a man marries a woman whose parents, relatives, and friends are in high office, lucrative business, or commercial work and can set him up in better conditions. The man makes a pretense of marital love. In both cases, the pretenses are clearly for the fear of losing the advantages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #287 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>287. XVI. THAT THEY ARE FOR THE SAKE OF VARIOUS FAVORS EXPECTED FROM THE PARTNER OR FROM THE PARTNER'S KINDRED; THUS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF LOSING THEM. This is the case especially in marriages between those of unlike station and condition, respecting which see no. <a href="250.htm">250</a>; as when a man marries a wealthy wife and she puts away her money in bags or her treasure on mortgage, and still more if she insists boldly that the husband is in duty bound to support the household out of his own property and income. That this results in forced similitudes of love as though it were conjugial, is a matter of common knowledge. The like is the case if a wife is taken whose parents, kindred, and friends are in offices of dignity, in lucrative business or in mercantile occupations, and are in a position to influence the state of his prosperity. That because of this there are simulations of love as though it were conjugial, is also a matter of common knowledge. That in both these cases they are on account of fear of the loss of these things is obvious. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #287 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>287. (xvi) They are for the sake of various favors expected from the partner or from his or her kindred and thus for fear of losing them. This is especially true of marriages between those of dissimilar station and condition (see above,<a href="250.htm">250</a>). Suppose a man has married a wealthy wife, who hides her money in bags or puts her treasure in trust and even boldly insists that the husband is in duty bound to maintain the home himself from his estate and income. The world knows that simulation of something like marital love is forced then. The like takes place when one has married a wife whose parents, relatives and friends are in high office, in lucrative business or in well paid work, and are able to give her the more prosperous standing. It is common knowledge that there are then simulations of a love like marital love. It is plain that in both instances simulation is for fear of losing the advantages indicated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #287 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>287. (16) That they are for the sake of various favors, expected from the married partner or from his or her kindred, and thus for fear of the loss of them. This takes place, especially, in marriages of dissimilar station and condition, of which above at n. <a href="250.htm">250</a>. As when a wealthy wife is taken, and she puts away her money in bags, or puts out her treasure on mortgage; and more yet, if she insists boldly that the husband is in duty bound to support the household out of his own property and income. That similitudes as if of conjugial love are thence resorted to by compulsion is commonly known. The like takes place when a wife is taken whose parents, kindred, and friends are high in office, in lucrative business, or in mercantile occupations, who are able to arrange for her a more prosperous condition, that for the sake of this also there are simulations as if of conjugial love is commonly known. That in both cases they are for the fear of the loss of them is obvious. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #287 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>287. XVI: Quod sint propter varios favores exspectatos a conjuge, aut ab ejus cognatis, et sic propter timores jacturae illorum. Hoc fit imprimis in conjugiis dissimilis status et conditionis, de quibus videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_287/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_250" target=_top>250</a>; sicut cum ducitur uxor opulenta, et haec recondit suos nummos in crumenis, aut gazas in hypothecis; et plus si audacter instat, quod ex debito mariti sit, ex suo censu et reditu sustentare domum; quod inde sint coactae similitudines amoris sicut conjugialis, communiter notum est. Similia fiunt cum uxore ducta, cujus parentes, cognati et amici, in officiis dignitatis, in negotiis lucri, et in operis mercium sunt, qui de statu ejus prosperiori possunt disponere; quod propter haec etiam sint simulationes amoris sicut conjugialis, communiter notum est. Quod haec et illae <sup>1</sup>sint propter timores jacturae illorum patet.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: illa </p>
