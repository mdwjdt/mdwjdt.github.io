<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第8节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>8、此后，天使又回到基督教界的智者聚会的大厅，召集那些确信天上喜乐和永恒幸福就是伊甸园的快乐之人，对他们说：“跟我来，我将带你们到伊甸园，你们心目中的天堂，使你们开始得享你们永恒幸福的祝福。”于是，天使领他们穿过由珍贵树种的高耸枝条和大树枝交织成的高门。一进去，他就领着他们从一个地方迂回到另一个地方。实际上，这是天堂最外围入口处的花园。凡在世时以为整个天堂既被称为伊甸园，必是一个超级大花园的人；或头脑中有执念，认定人死后会彻底摆脱劳作安息，而这安息仅仅是深吸快乐的气息，漫步在玫瑰丛中，享受最美味的葡萄酒，举行宴会，并认为只有天堂乐园才有这种生活的人，就被带到这里来。<br><br>在天使引领下，他们看见一大群人，既有老人、年轻人、少男，也有妇女和少女。女人们三五成群地坐在玫瑰花丛中编织花环，将其戴在老年人的头上，套在年轻人的胳膊上，挂在男孩子的胸前；有的从树上采摘水果，放到篮子里带给同伴；有的将葡萄、樱桃和桑葚压成汁，倒入高脚杯中，开怀畅饮；有的呼吸鲜花、水果、香叶散发的芳香；有的唱着令听众陶醉的甜美歌曲；有的坐在喷泉边，以将喷泉水塑成各种形状为乐；有的边散步边打趣聊天；有的跑步、玩耍、跳舞，有分成组的，有围成圈的；有的进到凉亭里，躺在沙发上等等。<br><br>看完这一切，天使领着他的同伴沿着蜿蜒的小路左拐右拐，最后来到一组人跟前。这些人坐在最漂亮的玫瑰花坛旁边，周围有橄榄树、橘子树和柠檬树。他们正摇来晃去，抱着脑袋悲伤哭泣。天使的同伴招呼他们说：“你们为何这样坐着？”他们回答说：“我们来这园子已经七天了。刚进来的时候，我们的心似乎飞上天堂，也沉浸在天堂喜悦的至深极乐中。但三天后，这快乐开始减弱，从我们心里逐渐消退，变得难以察觉，最后完全消失。当我们所想象的快乐消失后，我们害怕失去生活的全部乐趣，开始质疑是否存在永恒幸福这回事。后来，我们在各条小路和花坛之间穿梭徘徊，寻找进来的大门。我们到处兜圈子，碰见人就打听。有人告诉我们，不可能找到大门，因为这个天堂乐园就是一个巨大的迷宫，它的特点是，想要出去的人只会迷失得更深。还补充说：‘所以，你们别无选择，不得不永远呆在这里。你们正在园子的中心，它的所有快乐都集中在这里！’”他们继续对天使的同伴说：“我们在这里坐了一天半了，因为对找着出路已经绝望，所以就在这玫瑰花坛边坐下来。我们能看到周围大量的橄榄、葡萄、橘子和香橼，但越看，眼睛就越厌烦看，鼻子越厌烦闻，舌头越厌烦尝。这就是为何你们会看到我们现在难过、悲伤、哭泣的原因。”<br><br>听完这话，陪同这组人的天使对他们说：“这个乐园迷宫的确是天堂的一个入口。我认识路，会带你们出去。”闻听此言，那些坐着的人一跃而起，拥抱天使，跟在天使和他的同伴后面。在路上，天使教导他们何为天上的喜乐和永恒的幸福。天使告诉他们，乐园里并没有外在的快乐，除非这快乐具有内在快乐。乐园的外在快乐仅仅是身体感官的快乐，而内在快乐是灵魂情感的快乐。除非外在快乐中有这些快乐，否则它们里面没有天上的生命，因为其中没有灵魂。每种快乐若没有其对应的灵魂，都会逐渐消退，变得迟钝，并使精神疲乏，比劳作更甚。天堂处处有乐园，天使能在其中找到极大的快乐，这些快乐中的灵魂之乐越多，天使感受为快乐的快乐就越多。”<br><br>听到这里，他们异口同声地问道：“什么是灵魂的快乐，它的源头在哪里？”天使回答说：“灵魂的快乐来自主的爱与智慧，因为爱是果效的原因，它凭借智慧产生果效，所以，爱与智慧居于果效，果效就是服务。主将这快乐注入灵魂，这快乐又通过心智的高层和低层降至所有身体感官，在此得到满足。快乐由此成为快乐，并因着作为其源头的永恒者而变得永恒。你们已参观过乐园了，我向你们保证，那里的一切，哪怕一小片叶子，无不出自服务里面爱与智慧的婚姻。所以，人若享有这婚姻，就在天上的乐园里，因而在天堂中。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>8、（1）之后，天使返回到基督教界明智的人的集合中。他召集了那些认为天国之乐就是伊甸园的快乐的人们。</p><p>他对他们说：“跟着我，我带你们到伊甸园，你们的天国中，你们就可以享受永恒的幸福了。”他带着他们走过一条由交错的树枝及庄严的树木组成的通道，走过蜿蜒的小路，从一个地方到另一个地方。</p><p>那地方实际上是通往天堂的一个乐园，来到乐园中的人在世间时相信天堂就是一个乐园，因为天堂也被称作乐园。那些人相信死后他们将不用劳动，将在芬芳的气息中休憩，在玫瑰花瓣铺成的小径上散步，品尝美味的葡萄汁，在喜庆的宴会上畅饮美酒，他们相信这样的生活只有在天国般的乐园中才有。</p><p>（2）在天使的引导下，他们看到了无数的人，男人，年长的年轻的以及孩子，还有女人及孩子。一些人坐在玫瑰花坛旁，或三个一组，或十几个一组。他们在编花环，用来做年长的男人的头饰，来装饰年轻人的手腕，来做男孩子的胸饰。其它的人在采果子，并将它们装在篮子里送给朋友。还有人在榨葡萄汁，樱桃汁和莓子汁，做成天然的饮料装在杯子里。还有在闻着来自鲜花，水果及树木的香气。还有人在唱美悦耳的歌。还有人在撒水，还有人散着步，互相开着玩笑。还有人在跑着，玩着、跳着，有时组成一组，有时围成圆圈。还有人在花园中的房间里躺在沙发上。还有许多乐园中的快乐情景。</p><p>（3）看过这些场景后，天使带着他们四处走走，最后来到坐在玫瑰中，被橄榄树、桔子树及香椽树所环绕的人们中。来回返复之后，他们坐下来，用手托着下颏伤心，难过起来。一起的天使问道：“你们为什么这这个样子？”他们回答说：“现在已经是我们到这儿的第七天了。我们刚到时感觉我们已经升入了天堂，并得到了其中的快乐。但三天以后，这种快乐就开始变得无耽，并消失了。再也感受不到了，再也不是一种祝福了。在我们想像的快乐消失后，我们开始害怕我们将失去生命中的一切快乐，我们开始怀疑是否有永恒的幸福。</p><p>“之后，我们四处找我们进来时的入口，但却发现只是在兜圈子子。我们询问他们，一些人说，大门永远也不会被找到，因为这个花园似的乐园是个无限大的迷宫。想要离开的人将越来越陷入其中。因而，最终你没有别的选择，只能留在这，直到永远。我们还被告知：“你们正在乐园的中心，这里集中所有的乐园中的快乐。</p><p>他们又对随行的天使说：“我们已经坐在这里一天半了。因为我们已经没有找到出口的希望，只好坐在玫瑰花园旁，周围是大量的橄榄树，萄萄藤和桔子树和香椽树。但是我们越多看它一眼，就会越怕再见到它们，怕再闻到它们的味道，怕再品尝它们。这就是我们为什么伤心难过的原因。”</p><p>（4）听到这些，天使对他们说：“这个迷宫，或称之为乐园，实际上是天堂的入口。我知道出去的路，我带你们出去。”</p><p>这时，坐在那儿的人站起来拥抱天使，跟着他一起走了。在路上，天使向他们解释什么是天国的快乐及永恒的幸福。天使说，它们不仅仅是外在的乐园中的快乐，除非它们与内在的快乐相结合。</p><p>“外在的快乐”他说道，“只是躯体感到的快乐，而内在的快乐是灵魂的快乐。除非内在的快乐处于外在的快乐之中，否则，则不是天国的生活，因为灵魂不在其中。没有相对应的灵魂的快乐，将会削弱并变得无聊，比劳动更可怕。乐园存在于天堂的每一个地方，它们是在使快乐的源泉，但是天使的快乐取决于快乐的灵魂之所在。”</p><p>（5）听到之些，他们问道：“什么是灵魂的快乐，它来自何处？”</p><p>天体回答道：“灵魂的快乐来自于主的爱和智慧，因为爱的行动而变化，通过智慧而产生效果，所以爱和智慧存在于行动之中，行动也就是有意义的服务，这种快乐由主而流入到灵魂中，从大脑的高层和低层进入到躯体的感觉之中，并在它们中得以实现。快乐因此而变成快乐，它因主而变得永恒，因为主是它永恒的源泉。</p><p>“你已经看到天堂中有什么了，我可以向你保证，那的每个东西，甚至一片小小的树叶都源于爱和智慧有意义相结合。因而，如果一个人处于这种结合中，他就处于天国的乐园中，即处于天堂中。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #8 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>8. After this the angel returned to the building where the wise from the Christian world were meeting, and called to himself those who had adopted the belief that the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness were the delights of a garden. 'Follow me,' he said to them, 'and I shall take you to a garden, your idea of heaven, so that you can begin to enjoy the blessings of your everlasting happiness.' He took them through a lofty gateway made from branches and boughs of splendid trees woven together; and then once inside he took them round by a circuitous route from one quarter to another. It was in fact a garden at the outermost entrance to heaven, to which those are taken who in the world had believed that the whole of heaven was one big garden, because it is called paradise. <sup >1</sup>There also arrive those who had fixed in their minds the notion that after death there is total rest from labours, and that this rest consists simply in breathing deep draughts of delights, walking amid roses, enjoying the most delicate juices of grapes, and holding entertaining drinking-parties, such a life being only possible in a heavenly garden.</p><p>[2] Under the angel's guidance they saw a huge throng of men, both old and young, of boys, and of women and girls. There were groups upon groups of three or ten, sitting among the rose-beds weaving garlands to adorn the heads of the old men, the arms of the young men and to wrap around the chests of the boys. Other women were picking fruits from the trees and carrying them in baskets to their companions. Others were pressing juice into goblets out of grapes, cherries and berries, and drinking it with pleasure. Others were sniffing the fragrance given off and spread around by flowers, fruits and aromatic foliage. Others were singing sweet songs to charm the ears of those present. Others were sitting by springs, and diverting the gushing water to make channels of various shapes. Others were walking about conversing and joking together. Others were running, playing, dancing, at one place to make patterns, at another in rings. Others were going into summer-houses to lie down on couches; and there were many other garden delights.</p><p>[3] When they had seen this, the angel led his companions through paths that wound hither and thither; and at last they came to a group who were sitting in a most beautiful rose-garden, surrounded by olive, orange and lemon trees. They were rocking to and fro, with their heads in their hands, grieving and weeping. The angel's companions addressed them and said: 'Why are you sitting like that?' 'It is seven days now,' they replied, 'since we came into this garden. When we came in our minds seemed to soar to heaven and to be plunged into the inmost bliss of its joys. But after three days the bliss began to wear off, to fade from our minds, becoming impossible to feel and so nothing. When the joys we had imagined died away, we were afraid of losing all the pleasure in our lives; and we started to feel doubtful whether there was such a thing as everlasting happiness. After this we wandered through the paths and beds, looking for the gate by which we had come in. But we wandered round and round in circles, asking anyone we met. Some of these told us that the gate was not to be found, because this paradise of a garden is a vast maze, so arranged that anyone who wants to get out penetrates deeper into it. "So you have no option but to stay here for ever," they said. "You are in the middle of it, where all its delights are concentrated."'<p>The people they had encountered went on to tell the angel's companions: 'We have been sitting here now for a day and a half, and since we have lost all hope of finding the way out, we sat down by this rose-bed. We can see masses of olives, grapes, oranges and citrus-fruit around us, but the more we look at them, the more our eyes get tired of seeing them, our noses of smelling them, our tongues of tasting them. That is why you see us now sad, grieving and weeping.'</p><p>[4] On hearing this the angel with the group said to them: 'This garden-maze is in fact an entrance to heaven. I know the way and will take you out.' When he said this, those who were sitting down sprang up and embraced the angel, and they followed him together with his group. On the way the angel taught them what heavenly joy and everlasting happiness are. He told them that there is no outward delight in gardens, unless this is accompanied by inward delight in gardens. The outward delights of gardens are only delights of the bodily senses, but inward delights are delights of the affections of the soul. Unless these are within the outward ones, there is no heavenly life, because there is no soul, in them. Every delight without its corresponding soul becomes feeble and dull by continuance, and wearies the mind more than work. There are paradise-gardens everywhere in the heavens, and the angels find great joy in them, and the more delight of the soul there is in them, the more they feel those joys as joys.'</p><p>[5] On hearing this they all asked: 'What is the delight of the soul, and where does it come from?' 'The delight of the soul,' the angel answered, 'comes from love and wisdom under the Lord's guidance. Since love is an effective agent and achieves its effect through wisdom, so both of these are present in the effect, and the effect is service. The Lord pours this delight into the soul, and it passes down through the higher and lower levels of the mind into all the bodily senses, where it reaches its fulfilment. That is what makes joy joy, and it becomes everlasting by the action of Him who is its everlasting source. You have seen the gardens, and I assure you, there is nothing in them, not so much as a tiny leaf, which is not the product of the marriage of love and wisdom realised in service. So if anyone enjoys this, he is in the heavenly garden, and so in heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #8 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>8. After this the angel returned to the house where the wise from the Christian world were assembled, and he called to him those who had instilled in themselves the belief that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness were the delights of a paradise.<p>He said to them, "Follow me and I will introduce you to paradise, your heaven, so that you may start on the blessings of your eternal happiness." And he led them through a high gateway constructed out of the interwoven branches and boughs of stately trees. Beyond the entrance he led them around through winding paths from place to place.<p>It was, in fact, an actual paradise at the first entrance to heaven, to which people are admitted who in the world had believed that the whole of heaven is a single paradise, because it is called Paradise, <sup >1</sup>and who had fixed in themselves the idea that after death they would find complete rest from their labors, rest that would consist solely in breathing in delightful essences, walking on rose petals, enjoying the delicate juices of grapes, and partaking of liquid refreshments at festive parties, a way of life they believed possible only in a heavenly paradise.</p><p>[2] Led by the angel they saw an immense number of people - of men, old and young, and boys, and also women and girls. Some of them were sitting by beds of roses, in groups of three and groups of ten, weaving garlands with which to adorn the heads of the older men, the arms of the youths, and - as though with sashes - the breasts of the boys. Other groups were picking fruits from the trees and carrying them in baskets to their companions. Others were pressing the juice from grapes, cherries and berries into cups and good-naturedly drinking. Others were breathing in and smelling the wafting aromas given off by the flowers, fruits and fragrant leaves. Others were singing sweet songs with which they delighted the ears of those present. Others were sitting at fountains and spraying the jets of water into various patterns. Others were walking, talking and exchanging pleasantries. Others were running, playing, and dancing, sometimes in sets, and sometimes in circles. Others were going into garden houses to lie down on the couches. And so on with other pleasures suitable to a paradise.</p><p>[3] After they had viewed these scenes, the angel led his companions along by-paths here and there, and finally to some people sitting in a beautiful rose garden surrounded by olive trees, orange trees, and citrons. Rocking back and forth, they sat with their cheeks in their hands, grieving and weeping. The companions of the angel spoke to them and said, "Why are you sitting here like this?"<p>And they replied, "It is now the seventh day since we came into this paradise. When we arrived it seemed as though our minds had been raised into heaven and admitted into the inmost blessings of its joys. But after three days these blessings began to grow dull and vanish in our minds, becoming no longer perceptible and so no longer blessings. And when our imagined joys thus died, we became afraid of losing all delight in our lives, and we started to doubt whether there is any eternal happiness.<p>"Moreover, we then wandered about through the paths and areas to look for the gate through which we entered. But we went around and around in circles. When we asked the people we met, some of them said the gate is never found, because this garden paradise is an immense maze, of the sort that if anyone tries to leave, he goes in deeper. 'Consequently you have no choice but to remain here to eternity,' we were told. 'You are at the center of the paradise, where all its delights are at their focus.'"<p>And they said further to the companions of the angel, "We have been sitting here now for a day and a half. And because we have lost hope of finding the way out, we have set ourselves down by this rose garden, and we look about us at the abundance of olive trees, grapes, oranges, and citrons. But the more we look at them, the wearier our eyes grow of seeing them, our noses of smelling them, and our mouths of tasting them. This is the reason for the sorrow, grief and tears in which you see us."</p><p>[4] On hearing this, the angel with the company said to them, "This maze or paradise actually is an entrance into heaven. I know the way out and will take you."<p>At that, the people sitting there got up and embraced the angel, and went with him along with his company. And on the way the angel explained to them what heavenly joy and so eternal happiness are, saying that they are not the outward delights of a paradise unless they include at the same time the inward delights of a paradise.<p>"The outward delights of a paradise," he said, "are only delights of the physical senses, while the inward delights of a paradise are delights of the affections of the soul. Unless the inward delights are in the outward, there is no heavenly life, because the soul is not in them, and every delight without its corresponding soul at once grows weak and dull, wearying the mind more than labor. Garden paradises exist everywhere in the heavens, and they are also sources of joy to the angels, but the joys are joys to the angels to the degree that a delight of the soul is in them."</p><p>[5] When they heard this, they all asked, "What is a delight of the soul, and where does it come from?"<p>The angel answered, "Delight of the soul comes from love and wisdom from the Lord. And because love is creative of effects, and is effective through wisdom, therefore the abode of both love and wisdom is in the effect, and the effect is useful service. This delight flows from the Lord into the soul, and it descends through the higher and lower regions of the mind into all the senses of the body and fulfills itself in them. Joy becomes joy from this, and it becomes eternal from Him who is its eternal source.<p>"You have seen what paradise holds, but I assure you that there is not one thing there, not even a tiny leaf, that does not originate from a marriage of love and wisdom in useful service. Consequently if a person is in this marriage, he is in a heavenly paradise, thus in heaven."<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-corinthians_12_2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #8 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>8. After this the angel went back to the house where the wise from the Christian world were convened, and he gathered up the ones who had persuaded themselves that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness are the delights of Paradise. "Follow me," he said, "and I will lead you into Paradise - your heaven - to begin the blessings of your eternal happiness."<p>And he led them through a lofty gateway made from the limbs and branches of stately trees twined together. After entering he led them in a roundabout way from one place to another. It actually was a paradise in the first entrance to heaven, where they send people who had believed, while in the world, that heaven is all one paradise, because it is called that - people who had the notion impressed on them that after death comes total rest from labor and that this rest is nothing other than inhaling breezes of delight, walking on roses, cheered by the most delicious grape juice, and having festive banquets, and that this life is found only in a heavenly Paradise.<p>Led by the angel, they saw a great crowd of old and young men, boys, women, and girls, sitting three by three and ten by ten in rose gardens, weaving garlands to deck the heads of the old men and the arms of the young men and to twine around the chests of the boys. They saw others gathering fruit from the trees and taking it to their friends in osier baskets; others pressing the juice of grapes, cherries, and berries into cups and merrily drinking it; others sniffing the fragrances that the flowers, fruits, and odoriferous leaves gave off all around; others singing sweet songs to charm the ears of anyone around; others sitting at fountains making the water squirt from the ducts in various shapes; others walking around talking and tossing off pleasantries; others running, playing, and dancing, here in rhythm and there in circles; others going into little garden houses to relax on the couches.<p>And there were many other paradisal delights.<p>After they saw these things, the angel led his group around here and there and at last to some people sitting in a very beautiful rose garden surrounded by olive, orange, and citron trees. They rocked back and forth with their hands to their cheeks, wailing and weeping. The angel's followers spoke to them and said, "Why are you sitting like that?"<p>"It is the seventh day now since we entered this Paradise," they answered. "When we came it looked as if our minds were raised to heaven and placed in the deepest happiness of its joys.<p>But after three days the edge began to wear off this happiness. It faded from our minds and feelings, till it was no happiness at all.<p>And when our imaginary joys ended like this we were afraid we had lost all pleasure from our life. We're becoming skeptical about eternal happiness - if there is such a thing.<p>"Then we wandered through paths and clearings looking for the gate where we came in, but we were wandering round and round in circles.<p>"We asked people we met. Some of them said, 'You won't find the gate, because this garden of Paradise is a great big labyrinth - the kind where anyone who wants to get out gets deeper in. So there's nothing to do but stay here forever. You are in the middle of it - the central point of all its delights.'"<p>And they further informed the angel's followers, "We have been sitting here for a day and a half now. We have no hope of finding the way out, so we sat down in this rose garden, and we see plenty of olives, grapes, oranges, and citrons around us. But the more we look at them the more tired our eyes are of seeing, our noses of smelling, and our mouths of tasting. This is why you see us weeping in grief and sorrow."<p>When the group's angel heard this he said, "This labyrinth of a paradise really is an entrance to heaven. I know the way and will lead you out."<p>When he said this, the people sitting there stood up and hugged the angel and followed him, together with his group. And the angel taught them on the way about the joy of heaven and the eternal happiness from it - that these are not the superficial delights of Paradise unless the inward delights of Paradise are there within them at the same time. "The outward delights of Paradise are only delights for the body's senses, but the inward delights of Paradise delight the feelings in your soul. The outward delights have no soul, so the life of heaven is not in them unless the inward delights are in them. And any delight without soul related to it gradually gets feeble and dull and is more tiring to the mind than work.<p>There are garden paradises all over heaven, and the angels get pleasure from them, too, and they enjoy the pleasures just to the extent that the delight of their soul is in them."<p>"What is the delight of a soul?" everyone asked, when they heard this, "and where does it come from?"<p>"The delight of a soul is from the love and wisdom from the Lord," the angel replied. "Love is the motive force, and it acts through wisdom, so you find them both in their activity - which is something of use. This delight flows from the Lord into your soul and works down through the higher and lower levels of your mind into all your bodily senses, and there it is fulfilled.<p>This is what makes joy really joy, and makes it eternal - from the Eternal, Whom it comes from. You have seen something of Paradise, and I assure you that not one thing is there - - not even a leaf - that is not from a marriage of love and wisdom in usefulness.<p>So if a person has this marriage in him he is in the paradise of heaven - in other words, in heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #8 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>8. After this, the angel returned to the house of assembly of the wise from the Christian world, and called those to him who had deluded themselves with the belief that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness were paradisal delights. To these he said: "Follow me, and I will introduce you into paradise, your heaven, that you may enter upon the blessedness of your eternal happiness."<p>Then, through a lofty gateway formed by the interlacing boughs and branches of noble trees, he introduced them [into a paradisal garden], and there led them around through winding paths from place to place. It was actually a paradise at the first entrance of heaven into which those are admitted who, in the world, had believed that the whole of heaven is a single paradise because it is so called, and had impressed on themselves the idea, that after death there is complete rest from all labor; that this rest is nothing else than breathing in the very soul of delights, walking upon roses, being gladdened with the most delicate juices of grapes, and celebrating festive banquets; and that this life is found only in the heavenly paradise.</p><p>[2] Led by the angel, they beheld a vast multitude of old and young men, and of boys; also of women and girls, some sitting upon beds of roses, in groups of threes and tens, making garlands with which to adorn the heads of the old men and the arms of the young, and bouquets for the breasts of the boys; others plucking fruit from the trees and carrying it in osier baskets to their companions; others pressing into cups and genially quaffing the juice of grapes, cherries and berries; others drawing into their nostrils the fragrant odors exhaled and diffused from flowers and fruits and fragrant leaves; others singing melodious songs with which they softly charmed the listeners' ears; others sitting by fountains and diverting the waters of the gushing stream into various forms; others walking about, talking together and throwing off witticisms; others running, playing and dancing, here in groups and there in circles; others entering into little summer-houses to repose on couches; not to mention many other paradisal enjoyments.</p><p>[3] When they had seen all this, the angel led his companions hither and thither through winding ways, and finally to some spirits sitting in a most beautiful rose garden surrounded by olive, orange, and citron trees. With swaying bodies and with their cheeks in their hands, they were wailing and weeping. Addressing them, the companions of the angel said, "Why sit ye thus?"<p>They answered: "It is now the seventh day since we came into this paradise. When we entered, our minds seemed as though elevated into heaven and admitted to the inmost enjoyment of its joys. But after three days, this happiness began to grow dull and to be diminished in our minds and become imperceptible, and so to become null. And when our imaginary joys thus ended, we feared the loss of all the delight of our life, and became doubtful about eternal happiness, doubtful even whether there is any eternal happiness. We then wandered through paths and open places seeking the gate by which we had entered. We wandered round and round in circle after circle and inquired the way of those we met, some of whom said: "The gate cannot be found because this paradisal garden is so spacious a labyrinth that whoever wishes to go out, enters more deeply in; so there is nothing else for you to do than stay here forever. You are in the midst of it, where all delights are in their very center."" They said further to the angel's companions: "Here now have we sat for a day and a half; and being without hope of finding the way out, we have lain down on this bed of roses. We see around us an abundance of olives, grapes, oranges, and citrons, but the more we look at them, the more is our sight wearied with seeing, our smell with smelling, and our taste with tasting. This is the cause of the sadness in which you see us, and of our wailing and weeping."</p><p>[4] Hearing this, the angel of the company said to them: "This paradisal labyrinth is truly an entrance into heaven. I know the way out and will lead you."<p>At these words the sitters rose up and embraced the angel. Then together with his group they accompanied him. On the way, the angel taught them what heavenly joy is, and hence eternal happiness; that they are not external paradisal delights unless, together with these, there are also internal paradisal delights. "External paradisal delights are merely delights of the senses of the body, but internal paradisal delights are delights of the affections of the soul. Unless these latter are present in the former there is no heavenly life in them, because no soul, and without its corresponding soul, every delight gradually grows feeble and torpid, and wearies the animus more than labor. In the heavens there are paradisal gardens everywhere, and angels derive joy from them, this joy being a joy to them so far as the delight of the soul is within it."</p><p>[5] Hearing this, they all inquired: "What is delight of the soul, and whence is it?" The angel replied: "Delight of the soul is from love and wisdom from the Lord; and since love is effective, being effective by means of wisdom, therefore the seat of both is in the effect, and the effect is use. This delight flows from the Lord into the soul, and descends through the higher and lower degrees of the mind into all the senses of the body, and there comes to fullness. Hence joy becomes joy and becomes eternal from the Eternal from whom it is. You have seen things paradisal, and I assure you that there is not a single thing therein, not so much as a little leaf, which is not from the marriage of love and wisdom in use. Therefore, if a man is in this marriage, he is in a heavenly paradise and so in heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #8 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>8. Upon this the angel returned to the house where the wise from the Christian world were gathered, and called to him those who were persuaded that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness are the delights of a paradise. He bade them: "Follow me, and I will introduce you into a paradise, your heaven, and you can begin on the blessedness of your eternal happiness."<p>He led them through a lofty gateway formed of the interwoven boughs and branches of noble trees. The way began to wind about. The place was in fact a paradise at the first entrance to heaven, where those are sent who in the world have believed that all heaven is just a paradise because it is so called, and who also have impressed on themselves the notion that after death there is rest from all work - a rest which is spent in inhaling the soul of delights, in walking on roses, in enjoying the most delicate grape-wines, and going to festive gatherings - and that such an existence is to be had only in a heavenly paradise.</p><p>[2] Conducted by the angel, they beheld a vast multitude of men old and young, and boys, and of women and girls, too, some sitting by threes and tens in rose-gardens, weaving garlands with which to adorn the heads of the old and the arms of the young, and to festoon the boys. Others were picking fruit from the trees and bearing it in osier baskets to their friends; others were pressing the juice of grapes, cherries and berries into cups and gaily drinking; others were breathing in the fragrances exhaled and diffused by flower, fruit and scented leaf; others were singing sweet songs which charmed the listeners' ears; others sat beside fountains and changed the up-gushing water into different patterns; others were walking about, chatting, and jesting; others were running, playing, or dancing, some by themselves, some in groups; still others went and reclined on couches in the small garden-houses; not to mention many other pleasures of the paradise.</p><p>[3] After they had seen these things, the angel conducted his companions here and there by winding ways, and finally up to some people who were sitting in a very beautiful rose-garden enclosed by olive, orange and citron trees. These folks, their drooping heads propped on their hands, were weeping and wailing. The angel's companions addressed them and asked, "Why are you sitting here so sad?" They replied, "This is the seventh day since we came into this paradise. When we entered, our minds seemed to be swept up to heaven and carried into the inner happinesses of its joys. After three days, however, this happiness began to dull, to be banished from our minds, and to turn unreal and into nothing at all. When the joys we imagined had died, we feared we should lose all delight in living, and began to question whether indeed any eternal happiness exists. Then we wandered by paths and open places, seeking the gate by which we entered. We strayed in circles, and asked directions of those we met. Some of them said, 'It is impossible to find the gate; this garden-paradise is such an extensive labyrinth that any one who wants to get out of it only gets farther into it. There is nothing to do but to remain here forever. You are in the heart of the paradise, where all delights center." And they continued to the angel's companions, "We have sat here now a day and a half. Having lost hope of finding the way out, we have been resting in this rose-garden, where we look upon this wealth of olives, grapes, oranges and citrons. But the more we look at them, the more our eyes tire with looking, our nostrils with smelling, our tongues with tasting. Now you know the cause of the gloom, grief and weeping in which you behold us."</p><p>[4] Hearing this, the angel of the company told them, "This labyrinthine paradise is in truth an entrance to heaven. I know the way out and will lead you forth."<p>At these words they sprang up, embraced the angel, and joined his company. As they proceeded the angel instructed them what heavenly joy and eternal happiness therefrom are - that these are not to be found in the external delights of a paradise if unaccompanied by internal paradisaical delights. "The external are only delights of the bodily senses, whereas the internal are delights of the affections of the soul. The external have no heavenly life in them apart from the internal, being then without a soul. Any delight apart from its corresponding soul becomes languid and dull, and tires the mind more than work does. Everywhere in heaven are garden-paradises, which afford the angels joys; but it is only as far as delight of the soul is in these joys, that they are joys."</p><p>[5] Hearing this, they all asked, "What is delight of the soul, and whence is it?"<p>The angel answered, "Delight of the soul is from love and wisdom from the Lord. Love is the doer, and it acts by means of wisdom; the two therefore have their settled abode in deed, which is use. The delight flows from the Lord into the soul, and descends through the higher and lower ranges of the mind into all the bodily senses, where it fulfils itself. Joy then becomes joy, and is eternal from the Eternal Being whence it is. You have seen a paradise, and I assure you that there is not a thing there, not even a small leaf, which is not from the marriage of love and wisdom in use. When a man is in this marriage, he, too, is in the heavenly paradise or in heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #8 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>8. After this the angel returned to the house of assembly of the wise from the Christian world, and called those to him who had induced on themselves the belief that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness are paradisal delights. He said to them, 'Follow me, and I will bring you into paradise, your heaven, that you may enter into the blessedness of your eternal happiness.'<p>And he led them through a lofty gateway formed of the interlacing boughs and branches of noble trees. After entering he led them about through winding ways from place to place. It was a paradise indeed, at the first entrance of the heaven to which they are sent who in the world had believed that the whole heaven is one paradise, because it is called paradise; and who had impressed upon themselves the idea that after death there is entire rest from labor, and that this rest is nothing else than breathing in the very soul of delights, walking upon roses, gladdened with most delicious juice of grapes, and celebrating festive banquets; and that this life is only found in a heavenly paradise. Being led by the angel they beheld a vast multitude of old and young men, and boys, and also women and girls, sitting three by three and ten by ten upon beds of roses, weaving garlands with which they adorned the heads of the aged, the arms of the young men, and twined as bands about the breasts of the boys; others plucking fruit from the trees and bearing it in osier baskets to their companies; others pressing into cups and genially quaffing the juice of grapes, cherries, and berries; others drawing into their nostrils the fragrance exhaled and diffused around from the flowers and fruits and fragrant leaves; others singing melodious songs with which they softly charmed the listeners' ears; others sitting by fountains, and turning into various forms the waters of the gushing stream; others walking about, talking and scattering pleasantries; others running, playing, and dancing, here in rhythm and there in circles; others entering into little garden-houses that they might repose on couches; and many other paradisal delights.<p>When they had seen these the angel led his attendants hither and thither through winding ways, and finally to some who were sitting in a most beautiful rose-bed surrounded by olive, orange, and citron trees, who nodding, were holding their hands to their cheeks, wailing and weeping. The attendants of the angel spoke to them, and said 'Why do you sit thus?'<p>They answered, 'It is now the seventh day since we came into this paradise. When we entered our minds seemed as if elevated into heaven, and admitted to the inmost happiness of its joys. But after three days this happiness began to grow dull and to decrease in our minds and become imperceptible, and so it came to be no happiness. And when our imaginary joys thus ended, we feared the loss of all the delight of our life, and became doubtful about eternal happiness, even whether there is any eternal happiness. Afterwards we rambled through paths and open places seeking the gate by which we entered; but we wandered round and round in circles.<p>'And we inquired of those we met: Some of them said, The gate cannot be found, because this paradisal garden is a spacious labyrinth, and is such that whoever thinks to go out enters more deeply in. Therefore, you cannot but stay here to eternity. You are in the midst of it where all delights are in their center.'<p>And they said further to the angel's attendants, 'Here now have we sat for a day and a half; and as we are without hope of finding the way out, we have been resting ourselves on this bed of roses and we see around us an abundance of olives, grapes, oranges, and citrons; but the more we look at them the more our eyes tire with looking, our nostrils with smelling, and our taste with tasting. This is the reason of the sadness, lamentation, and weeping in which you see us.'<p>Hearing this the angel of the company said to them, 'This paradisal labyrinth is really an entrance to a heaven. I know the way out and will lead you forth.'<p>At these words the sitters arose and embraced the angel, and with his company followed him. And the angel taught them by the way what heavenly joy is, and the eternal happiness therefrom, saying, 'They are not the outward paradisal delights, unless at the same time there are within them the inward paradisal delights. The outward paradisal delights are only delights of the bodily senses, but the inward paradisal delights are delights of the affections of the soul. Unless these are in the former there is no heavenly life in them, for there is no soul in them; and every delight without its correspondent soul gradually grows feeble and torpid, and wearies the mind more than labor. There are paradisal gardens everywhere in heaven, and the angels derive joys from them; but these joys are joys to them in so far as the delight of the soul is in them.'<p>Hearing this they all inquired, 'What is the delight of the soul, and whence is it?'<p>The angel responded, 'The delight of the soul is from love and wisdom from the Lord; and as love is effective, and is effective through wisdom, the seat of both is therefore, in the effect, and the effect is use. This delight flows into the soul from the Lord, and descends through the higher and the lower degrees of the mind into all the senses of the body, and fills itself full in them. Thence the joy becomes joy indeed, and becomes eternal, from the Eternal from whom it is. You have seen things paradisal; and I assure you that there is not a thing therein, not so much as a little leaf, that is not from the marriage of love and wisdom in use. If therefore, a man is in this marriage he is in a heavenly paradise, and so is in heaven.' </p>

Post haec Angelus rediit ad Domum conventus sapientum ex Christiano Orbe, et ad se vocavit illos, qui sibi induxerant fidem, quod gaudia Coeli et Felicitas aeterna essent delitiae Paradisiacae: his dixit, "sequimini me, et introducam vos in Paradisum, Coelum vestrum, ut exordiamini beatitudines felicitatis aeternae vestrae;" et introduxit illos per excelsam Portam, ex ramis et propaginibus nobilium arborum compaginatis exstructam: post introitum circumduxit illos per ambages a plaga in plagam; erat actualiter Paradisus in primo ingressu ad coelum, in quem immittuntur illi qui in Mundo crediderant quod universum Coelum sit unus Paradisus, quia vocatur Paradisus; ac qui impresserant sibi ideam, quod post mortem sit plenaria requies a laboribus, et quod requies haec non aliud esset, quam animas delitiarum trahere, super rosis ambulare, ex mustis delicatissimis uvarum laetificari, ac festiva repotia celebrare; et quod haec vita non detur nisi in Coelesti Paradiso.</p><p>[2] Ducti ab Angelo videbant ingentem multitudinem tam senum quam juvenum, et puerorum, et quoque mulierum et puellarum; triades et triades, ac decades et decades, sedentes super Rosetis flectentes <sup>1</sup>serta, quibus ornarent capita senum, brachia juvenum, ac fasciatim pectora puerorum; alias legentes ex Arboribus fructus, et in calathis portantes ad sodalitia; alias exprimentes mustum ex uvis, cerasis et acinis in cyathos, et genialiter bibentes; alias attrahentes naribus fragrantias ex floribus, fructibus ac odoriferis foliis exhalatas et circumsparsas; alias canentes dulces odas quibus mulciebant praesentium auditus; alias sedentes ad fontes, et aquas salientis venae derivantes in varias formas; alias ambulantes, confabulantes, et spargentes facetias; alias currentes, ludentes, saltantes hic in numeros, et ibi in orbes; alias ingredientes domunculas hortulanas, ut super spondis cubarent; praeter plures alias laetitias paradisiacas.</p><p>[3] Postquam haec visa sunt, duxit Angelus comites suos per circuitus huc illuc, ac ultimo ad sedentes in pulcherrimo Roseto circumcincto arboribus olivae, aurantii, et citri, qui nutantes tenebant manus sub genis, lugentes, et lachrymantes; hos alloquuti sunt comites Angeli, et dixerunt, "cur ita sedetis;" et responderunt, "est nunc septimus dies a quo in hunc Paradisum venimus; cum intravimus, visa est mens nostra sicut elevata in Coelum, ac immissa in intimas ejus gaudiorum faustitates; sed post triduum coeperunt faustitates illae hebescere, et in mentibus nostris aboleri, ac fieri insensibiles, et sic nullae; et cum ita exspirata sunt imaginaria nostra gaudia, timebamus jacturam omnis jucunditatis vitae nostrae, et facti sumus <sup>2</sup>ambigui de felicitate aeterna, num sit aliqua; et postea vagati sumus per vias et areas, quaesituri portam per quam intravimus; sed vagati sumus per gyros et gyros, ac interrogavimus obvios; ex quibus aliqui dixerunt, quod porta non inveniatur, quia Paradisiacus hic hortus est spatiosus Labyrinthus, qui talis est, ut qui vult exire, penitius intret; 'quare non potestis aliter quam hic manere in aeternum; vos estis in medio ejus, ubi omnes delitiae sunt in suo centro:'" et porro dixerunt ad comites Angeli, "hic nunc per unum diem et dimidium sedimus, et quia absque spe inveniendi exitum sumus, reposuimus nos super Roseto hoc, et spectamus circum nos in copia olivas, uvas, aurantia et citros; sed quo plus illa spectamus, eo plus delassatur visus videndo, odoratus odorando, et gustus gustando; haec causa est maestitiae, luctus, et lachrymationis, in quibus vos videtis nos."</p><p>[4] His auditis, Angelus cohortis dixit illis, "est hic Labyrinthus Paradisiacus vere introitus in Coelum; novi exitum, et educam vos;" his dictis, sedentes surrexerunt, et amplexi Angelum, et una cum cohorte ejus comitati sunt illum; et Angelus in via docuit illos, quid Gaudium coeleste et inde Felicitas aeterna, quod non sint Delitiae paradisiacae externae, nisi simul cum illis sint Delitiae paradisiacae internae; "delitiae paradisiacae externae sunt modo delitiae sensuum corporis, at delitiae paradisiacae internae sunt delitiae affectionum animae; hae nisi in illis sint, non est vita coelestis, quia non est anima in illis; et omne delitium absque sua correspondente anima, ex continuo elanguescit <sup>3</sup>et torpescit, et plus delassat animum quam labor.
