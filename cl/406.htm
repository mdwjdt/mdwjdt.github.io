<h4 align="center"></h4><p>406、死后到了灵界，很容易区分属灵人和属世人对婴儿和孩子的爱之性质。因为绝大多数父亲一到灵界，就想起在他们之前死去的孩子，这些孩子也会出现在他们面前，好叫他们认出彼此。属灵的父亲只是看看他们，询问他们的状况；若一切安好，就很欣慰，否则，就很悲伤。然后，属灵的父亲会与他们聊上一会儿，嘱咐并告诫他们要在天上过道德的生活，之后离开他们，并且离开之前叫他们不必再把他们当作父亲记起，因为在天上，主是所有人唯一的父亲，正如祂在马太福音（23:9）中说得那样；从此以后，他们自己也永远不再记得他们是自己的孩子。<br><br>而属世的父亲一旦发现他们死后仍活着，并想起在他们之前死去的孩子，这些孩子也会照他们的愿望出现在他们面前。他们立刻与孩子结合，就像一捆柴那样粘在一起。然后，父亲继续乐于看到他们，与他们交谈。若父亲被告知，他的这些孩子当中有一些是撒旦，还伤害善人，他仍然把他们聚拢在身边，或留在自己面前的这群人当中。即便他亲眼看到他们伤天害理、作恶多端，依旧置若罔闻，不会将其中任何一个从他这群人当中驱逐出去。因此，为防止这个害人的群体持续下去，他们不得不一起被逐入地狱。在那里，这个父亲当着他孩子们的面被囚禁，而这些孩子则被拆散，各自被送往适合他生活的地方。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>406、对小孩子和对年长的孩子的爱的性质在精神的人和自然的人中的不同在死后会变得很明显。进入另一个世界后，大多数的父母亲都记得他们之前离开世间的孩子们，他们会与他们见面，并认出他们。</p><p>精神性的父母亲会看着他们问他们的情况，若他们一切都好，他就会感到高兴。否则就会感到悲伤。之后，在关于天国的生活交流后，他们会离开他们，并告诉他们，他们将不再会记得自己是他们的父亲，因为主是天国中所有人的父（《马太福音》23:9），他们也不会记得他们是自己的孩子。</p><p>相反，自然的父亲若认出在自己之前离开世间的孩子后就会立即去拥抱他们，他们会紧紧拥在一起。另外，父亲还会继续将孩子带在身旁。若被告知他的孩子是做恶的，他也会将他们避护起来。若他亲眼看到孩子做恶，他们就假装没有看到。所以为了避免这种情况的发生，他们被送到地狱中，在孩子们面前，父亲被关入牢中，孩子也被分到另处去各自为生。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #406 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>406. After death it is easy to tell the difference between the love of babies and children in the case of the spiritual and in the case of the natural. For most fathers on reaching that world remember their children who died before them and present themselves to them, so that they recognise each other. Spiritual fathers merely look at them and ask what their condition is, being pleased if it is well with them and grieved if not. Then after talking to them for a while, telling and warning them about leading a moral life in heaven, they leave them, telling them before leaving that they should no longer be remembered as their father, because the Lord is the sole father of all in heaven, as His words declare (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and thereafter they never remember them as their children.<p>Natural fathers, however, as soon as they realise that they are alive after dying and call to mind their children who died before them, also presenting themselves in accordance with their wishes, immediately become attached to them and cling as close as a bundle of fasces. <sup >1</sup>Then the father continually takes delight in looking at his children and talking with them. If the father is told that some of his children are satans and have done harm to good people, they none the less keep them in the company around them, or in the crowd before them. If he actually sees them inflicting harm and doing evil, he pays no attention to that, nor does he remove any from his company. To prevent therefore this injurious group lasting, they have to be banished together to hell; there the father is imprisoned before his children are; these are taken apart and each is assigned the place for which his life fits him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #406 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>406. The nature of the love of little children and love of older children found in spiritual people, and the nature of it in natural ones, is clearly apparent from such people after death. For on arriving in the other world, most fathers remember their children who have passed on before them; and these are also presented to them, and they recognize each other.<p>Spiritual fathers simply look them over and ask them in what state they are, rejoicing if all is well with them, and grieving if it is not. Then, following some conversation, instruction and counsel regarding a heavenly moral life, they part from them, telling them before parting that they are no longer to be remembered as their fathers, because the Lord is the only Father of all who are in heaven (according to His words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and that they will never remember them as being their children.<p>In contrast, as soon as natural fathers notice that they are living after death and recall to mind the children who have passed on before them, and in accordance with their wish and prayer these are also presented to them, they immediately throw their arms around each other and cling to each other like bound bundles of sticks. Moreover, the father then takes continual delight in beholding them and talking with them. If the father is told that some of these children of his are satanic fiends, and that they have inflicted injuries on the good, he nevertheless keeps them in a cluster about him or in a troop before him. If he himself sees them inflicting harm and doing evil things, he nevertheless pays no attention to it and does not separate any of them from him. Therefore, in order to keep such a pernicious band from continuing, of necessity they are sent off together into hell; and there, in the presence of his children, the father is shut up in prison, and the children are separated and each dispatched to a place in keeping with his life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #406 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>406. From spiritual and natural parents after death it is plain to see what their love of babies and children is like, for when they arrive in the spiritual world, most fathers remember their children who have died before them, and they appear and recognize each other. Spiritual fathers only look their children over and ask how they are. They rejoice if things are well and grieve if bad. And after a little conversation, instruction, and advice about the moral life of heaven, they separate. And before separating they teach them not to think of them as fathers any longer, because the Lord alone is father to everyone in heaven, according to His words<p>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and they never think of them as children.<p>But when worldly fathers first realize they are living after death and recall to mind their children who have died before them, and when they are made present in answer to a prayer of longing, they instantly cling together like a bundle of sticks tied together. And then the father keeps delighting in looking at them and talking with them. If the father learns that some of his children are satans, and that they have brought harm to good people, he still keeps them in a cluster around him or in a group in front of him. If he himself sees them bringing harm and doing wicked things, he pays no attention even to that and does not separate one of them from himself. To keep such a destructive herd from lasting, they all have to be sent into hell together, and there the father is locked up under guard in front of his children, and the children are taken separately and each sent to a place suited to their life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #406 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>406. The nature of the love of infants and children with the spiritual, and its nature with the natural, is manifestly perceived from parents [in the spiritual world] after death. When they come there, most fathers call to mind their children who have passed away before them, and the children are presented to them and there is mutual recognition. Spiritual fathers merely look at them and ask as to their state, rejoicing if it is well with them and grieving if it is ill; and, after some conversation, instruction, and admonition respecting heavenly moral life, they separate from them. But before separation, they teach them that they are no longer to be remembered as fathers because the Lord is the one only Father to all in heaven, according to His words (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>); and that they themselves never remember them as their children. But natural fathers, as soon as they realize that they are living after death and recall to their memory the children who had passed away before them and who also are presented to them according to their desire, are at once conjoined with them, and they cling together like a bundle of sticks. The father is then in continual delight at the sight of them and from conversation with them. If it is told him that some of these children of his are satans and have brought injury upon the good, he nevertheless keeps them in a circle around him, or in a group in front of him. If he himself sees that they inflict injury and do evil deeds, he still pays no heed and does not dissociate any of them from himself. Therefore, lest so harmful a company continue, they are of necessity sent together into hell. There, in the presence of his children, the father is put under guard and his children are separated, each being sent away to the place proper to his life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #406 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>406. It is plainly to be perceived from natural and spiritual parents in the life after death what the love of infants and children is like with the two kinds of parents respectively. On coming into the spiritual world, most fathers remember their deceased children; all become present to one another and recognize each other. Spiritual fathers only gaze on their children, ask in what state they are, rejoice if it is well with them, and grieve if it is ill. After some talk, instruction and admonition about moral heavenly life, they part, the fathers first teaching that they are to be remembered no longer as fathers, because the Lord is the one Father to all in heaven, according to His words (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and that they do not think of their children any longer as theirs. Natural fathers, however, when they first become conscious that they are living after death and recall their deceased children, who are then also presented before them according to their desire, are instantly conjoined with them, and they cling to each other like a bundle of sticks bound together. The father keeps enjoying the sight of them and conversation with them. If he is told that some of these his children are in fact satans and have done injury to the good, he nevertheless keeps them in a group about him or in a troop before him. Even though he sees them inflict injury and commit evils, he pays no attention to it, nor does he separate any of them from himself. Lest such a hurtful company persist, therefore, all of them are necessarily relegated to hell together, where the father is shut up under guard in his children's presence, the children are parted, and each is sent to the place of his own way of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #406 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>406. Of what kind the love of infants and the love of children is with the spiritual, and of what kind with the natural, is manifestly perceived from them after death. For most fathers, when they come into the world of spirits, call to mind. their children who have gone before them, and they also become present and mutually recognize each other. Spiritual fathers only look at them, ask in what state they are, rejoice if it is well with them and grieve if it is ill; and after some conversation, instruction, and admonition respecting heavenly moral life, they separate from them, but before separation, teach that they are no longer to be remembered as fathers, because the Lord is the one only Father to all in heaven, according to His words (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>); and that they never remember them as children.<p>But natural fathers, as soon as they realize that they are living after death and recall to their memory the children who had deceased before them, and as they are made present also by strong desire, are instantly conjoined. with them, and they cling together like a bundle of sticks tied together; and then the father is delighted continually with the sight of them and by conversation with them. If the father is told that some of these, his children, are satans, and that they have done injury to the good, yet he keeps them together in a sphere about him or in a company before him. If he himself sees that they inflict injury and do evil, he still pays no heed to it, and does not dissociate anyone of them from him. Wherefore, that such a pernicious company may not continue, they are of necessity sent together into hell; and there the father in the presence of his children is shut up under guard, and his children are separated and sent away, each to his place of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #406 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>406. Qualis est Amor infantum et Amor liberorum apud Spirituales, et qualis apud Naturales, evidenter perspicitur ex illis post mortem; plerique enim patres dum illuc veniunt, recordantur suorum liberorum, qui ante illos obiverunt, et quoque sistuntur praesentes, et agnoscunt se mutuo. Spirituales patres modo aspiciunt illos, et quaerunt in quo statu sunt, et gaudent si illis bene est, et dolent si male; et post aliquam colloquutionem, instructionem et admonitionem de vita morali coelesti, separant se ab illis, ac ante separationem docent, quod non amplius recordandi sint ut Patres, quia Dominus est unicus Pater omnibus in Coelo, secundum Ipsius verba <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_406/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_9" target=_top>Matth. 23:9</a>. et quod illorum, ut liberi, nusquam recordentur. Patres autem naturales, ut primum animadvertunt se viventes post mortem, ac in memoriam suam revocant liberos, qui ante illos obiverunt, et quoque secundum votum desiderii sistuntur praesentes, illico conjunguntur, et cohaerent sicut fasces colligati; ac tunc pater continue delectatur ex aspectu illorum, et ex colloquio cum illis: si dicitur patri, quod quidam ex liberis illis ejus sint satanae, et quod intulerint noxas bonis, nihilominus continet illos in globo circum se, aut in caterva ante se; si videt ipse quod damnum inferant, et mala faciant, usque ad illa nihil attendit, nec dissociat aliquem a se; quare ne talis cohors damnosa persistat, ex necessitate delegantur simul in infernum, ac ibi pater ante liberos includitur custodiae, ac liberi separantur, et quisque amandatur ad locum suae vitae. </p>
