<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>337、⑷因此，真正的婚姻之爱及其一切幸福只能被赐给那些属于基督教会的人。如它的专题章节（4章57-73节）和随后描述其本质的章节所述，婚姻之爱之所以只在那些属于基督教会的人当中才有可能，是因为主是这爱的唯一源头，别处的人对主没有这样的认识，以至于知道祂能作为神被靠近。还因为对每个个体来说，这爱取决于他里面的教会状态（130节），教会的纯正状态唯源于自主，因而只在那些从主接受它的人里面。这两个条件是这爱的初始、引入和稳固，这一点早就通过大量清晰、确凿的证据得以证实了，因此完全没必要再补充什么。然而，在基督教界，真正的婚姻之爱极其罕见（58，59节）；这是因为在那里，很少有人靠近主；其中包括一些相信教会，却不照它的教导生活之人；更不用说《揭秘启示录》一书所披露的许多事了，该书充分描述了当今基督教会的状态。尽管如此，这一真理，即：真正的婚姻之爱只在那些属于基督教会的人当中，依旧是正确的。也正因如此，一夫多妻从基督教会被彻底逐出。这个真理也是出于主的圣治，这对那些正确思考圣治的人来说是显而易见的。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>337、（4）婚姻之爱只有在基督教会中的人中才是可能的，这是因为它是来自于主的。而主不为不跟随他的人所知。另外这种爱也取决于人身上教会的状态。真正的教会的状态只能是来自于主的，我们已经证明了这两个元素是真正婚姻之爱的起始，发展和形成。</p><p>然而，真正的婚姻之爱在基督教界也是比较少的了（见59、59节），因为很少人在跟随主，那些跟随主的，他们相信教会，但却不按教会所教的生活，还有其它的一些情况，在The Apocalypse Revealed中有讲述。那里详细讲了当今基督教会的具体状况。</p><p>即使这样，情况还是如此，真正的婚姻之爱只有在基督教界才是可能的。这也是为什么一夫多妻制被基督教所禁止。这同时也是主的神圣万能性的体现，因为人若从神性方面考虑，这点是很显然的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #337 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>337. (iv) Consequently truly conjugial love with all its happiness cannot be granted except to those who belong to the Christian church.<p>The reason why conjugial love, as it is described in the Chapter devoted to it ([IV] <a href="57.htm">57-73</a>) and the following ones, which describe it in its essence, is only possible for those who belong to the Christian church, is that the Lord is the only source of that love, and the Lord is not so known elsewhere that He can be approached as God. It is also because that love depends upon the state of the church with the individual (<a href="130.htm">130</a>), and the proper state of the church can only come from the Lord, so that it is not found except with those who receive it from Him. These two things are the ones which first begin, introduce and establish this love, as has already been proved by such a quantity of evident and compelling reasons that it is quite superfluous to add anything more. The reason, however, why truly conjugial love is rare in the Christian world (<a href="58.htm">58-59</a>) is that few people there approach the Lord; and these include some who while believing in the church do not live in accordance with its teaching. There are other matters too which have been disclosed in THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED, which contains a full description of the present state of the Christian church. But it remains none the less true that truly conjugial love is only possible for those who belong to the Christian church. For this reason too polygamy has been utterly banished from it. This also is of the Lord's Divine providence, as is quite obvious to those who have a proper way of thinking about providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #337 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>337. 4. Consequently truly conjugial love is not possible except with people who are of the Christian Church. Conjugial love such as we described in its own chapter, <sup >1</sup>nos. <a href="57.htm">57-73</a>, and in the chapters following it, thus such as it is in its own essence, is not possible except with people who are of the Christian Church, for the reason that that love comes from the Lord alone, and the Lord is not so well known elsewhere that people can go to Him as God. Moreover, that love depends in everyone on the state of the church in him (no. <a href="130.htm">130</a>), and a genuine state of the church comes from no other source than the Lord, so that it does not exist in any others than those who receive it from Him. We have already demonstrated that these two elements are what initiate, introduce and establish truly conjugial love, showing it with such an abundance of clear and conclusive arguments that it is entirely unnecessary to add anything more.<p>Truly conjugial love is nevertheless rare in the Christian world (nos. <a href="58.htm">58</a>, <a href="59.htm">59</a>), because few there go to the Lord, and among those few are some who, although they believe the Church, do not live what it teaches. A number of other factors enter in besides, which have been disclosed in The Apocalypse Revealed, where the present state of the Christian Church is fully described.<p>But still the truth remains, that truly conjugial love is not possible except with people who are of the Christian Church. That also is why polygamy has been entirely banned from it. This happened, moreover, of the Lord's Divine providence, as is plainly evident to people who think rightly concerning Providence.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Viz., "Truly Conjugial Love." </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #337 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>337. 4. Consequently real married love cannot be had except among those who are from the Christian church. Except among those who are of the Christian religion there is no married love of the kind described in the chapter about it (nos. <a href="57.htm">57-73</a>) and in the chapters after that - in other words, married love as it is in essence - because that love comes only from the Lord, and the Lord is not known anywhere else, in such a way that He can be approached as God.<p>And besides, married love is in keeping with the state of the religion in a person (no. 130), and a genuine state of religion comes from the Lord alone, so it exists only among those who receive it from Him. These two things are the beginnings, the introductions, and the establishment of that love. This has already been settled by so many clear and convincing reasons that adding anything more would be thoroughly redundant.<p>The reason why real married love is rare even in the Christian world (nos. <a href="58.htm">58-59</a>) is that few there do go to the Lord, and among them some that do believe in the church do not live by it. And other reasons are brought out in Apocalypse Revealed, where it fully describes the state of the Christian church today.<p>But the fact remains that real married love is possible only for those in the Christian Church. And polygamy is totally condemned for this reason. It is palpably clear to those who think straight about providence that this is also due to the Lord's Divine Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #337 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>337. IV. CONSEQUENTLY, THAT LOVE TRULY CONJUGIAL IS NOT POSSIBLE EXCEPT WITH THOSE WHO ARE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. That there is no conjugial love such as is described in its special chapter (nos. <a href="57.htm">57-73</a>) and in the chapters that follow it, thus such as it is in its essence, save with those who are of the Christian Church, is because that love is from the Lord alone, and nowhere else is the Lord so known that He can be approached as God; also because, with each individual, that love is according to the state of the Church with him (no. <a href="130.htm">130</a>), and the genuine state of the Church is from no other source than the Lord, thus is with no others save those who receive it from Him. That these two requisites are the first beginnings, the introductions, and the stabilities of that love, has already been confirmed by such abundance of clear and conclusive reasons that it would be entirely superfluous to add anything more. That love truly conjugial is nevertheless rare in the Christian world (nos. <a href="58.htm">58, 59</a>), is because few there approach the Lord, and among those few are some who indeed believe in the Church but do not live according to it; not to mention the many things which have been disclosed in THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED, where the state of the Christian Church at this day is fully described. Nevertheless, the truth holds good, that there can be no love truly conjugial save with those who are of the Christian Church. Moreover, it is for this reason that polygamy has been wholly banned therefrom. That this is of the Lord's Divine Providence is clearly evident to those who think justly respecting Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #337 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>337. (iv) True marital love with its felicities can therefore exist only with those who are of the Christian Church. Marital love of the sort described in the chapter (n. <a href="57.htm">57-73</a>) on the subject and in some ensuing chapters, or marital love as it is in its essence, is to be found only with those of the Christian Church, for the reason that this love is from the Lord alone, who is not known elsewhere so that He can be approached as God; likewise because this love is according to the state of the Church in a man (<a href="130.htm">130</a>), and a true state of the Church is from no other source than the Lord, thus with no others than those who receive that state from Him. We have already established with such an abundance of reasoned evidences and conclusions that these two things are the primary elements, means and enablements of this love, that it is quite pointless to add more. True marital love is nevertheless rare in Christendom (n. <a href="58.htm">58-59</a>) for the reason that even in Christendom few approach the Lord; and some of these indeed believe the Church but do not live it. (Further reasons are disclosed in Apocalypse Revealed, where the contemporary state of the Christian Church is fully described.) Nevertheless the truth is that true marital love can exist only with those who are of the Christian Church. Therefore polygamy is absolutely condemned. That this is of the Lord's Divine Providence is very plain to those who think rightly of Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #337 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>337. (4) Consequently, that there cannot be love truly conjugial except with those who are of the Christian Church. The reason why conjugial love, such as is described in its own chapter n. 57-73 and in those following it, that is, such as it is in its essence, is not with any but those that are of the Christian church is, because that love is from the Lord only, and the Lord is not elsewhere so known that He can be approached as God; also, because the love is according to the state of the church with everyone (n. <a href="130.htm">130</a>), and a genuine state of the church is from no other source than the Lord, and thus is with no others but those who receive it from Him. That these' two are the first beginnings, introductions, and establishings of that love, has already been confirmed by such abundance of clear and conclusive reasons that it would be entirely superfluous to add anything more. That love truly conjugial is nevertheless rare in the Christian world (n. <a href="58.htm">58</a>, <a href="59.htm">59</a>), is because so few there approach the Lord, and among these are some who, although they believe the church, do not live it; besides the many facts that are disclosed in the Apocalypse Revealed, where the state of the Christian Church at this day is fully described. But the truth nevertheless holds good that there cannot be love truly conjugial except with those who are of the Christian Church; and for that reason polygamy has also been absolutely condemned. That this also is of the Lord's Divine Providence, is very clear to those who think justly respecting providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #337 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>337. IV. Consequenter, quod non dari queat Amor vere conjugialis, nisi quam apud illos qui ab Ecclesia Christiana sunt. Quod non detur Amor conjugialis, qualis in suo Capite,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_337/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_57" target=_top>57</a> ad 73, et in sequentibus illud, descriptus est, ita qualis est in sua essentia, nisi quam apud illos, qui ab Ecclesia Christiana sunt, est causa, quia ille Amor est a Solo Domino, et Dominus non alibi ita notus est, ut possit adiri ut Deus; tum quia amor ille est secundum statum Ecclesiae apud unumquemvis, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_337/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_130" target=_top>130</a>, et genuinus status Ecclesiae non aliunde est quam a Domino, ita non apud alios, quam qui ab Ipso recipiunt illum: quod haec duo sint illius amoris primordia, introductiones et constabilitiones, tali copia rationum evidentium et concludentium, hactenus firmatum est, ut prorsus supervacaneum sit aliquid superadjicere. Quod tamen usque Amor vere conjugialis in Orbe Christiano rarus sit,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_337/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_58" target=_top>58-59</a>. est quia pauci ibi adeunt Dominum, ac inter illos aliqui sunt, qui quidem credunt Ecclesiam, sed non vivunt illam; praeter plura, quae detecta sunt in Apocalypsi <sup>1</sup>Revelata, ubi plene describitur <sup>2</sup>status hodiernus Ecclesiae Christianae: sed nihilominus valet veritas, quod non dari queat amor vere conjugialis, nisi apud illos, qui ab Ecclesia Christiana sunt; quare etiam Polygamia inde prorsus damnata est; quod hoc etiam sit ex Divina Domini Providentia manifeste patet illis, qui de Providentia juste cogitant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: Apoclaypsi<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: discribitur </p>
