<p>- This corresponds to the marriage of the Lord and the church.

<p><a href="116.htm">6. The Marriage of the Lord and the Church (n. 116)</a>
<p>The Word calls the Lord a Bridegroom and Husband to the church.
<p>- It calls the Lord a father and the church a mother.
<p>- Offspring of the Lord as father and the church as mother are spiritual.
<p>- They are truths and good.
<p>- Married good and truth from the Lord give humans good and truth, or the church.
<p>- Husband and wife together make a church.
<p>- So a husband is not the counterpart of the Lord nor a wife that of the church.
<p>- The characteristics of marriage correspond to those of good and truth.
<p>- The Word is the Lord and is the connecting link.
<p>- The church is from the Lord and is in those who approach Him.
<p>- Married love is like the church among people.
<p>- The church comes from the Lord, so marriage does too.

<p>- Knowledge
<p>- Two angels describe marriage in the third heaven
<p><a href="138.htm">7. About "Chaste" and "Unchaste" (n. 138)</a>
<p>"Chaste" and "unchaste" apply only to marriages.
<p>- "Chaste" applies only to monogamous marriages.
<p>- Marriage can be chaste only if Christian.
<p>- True married love is chastity itself.
<p>- All the pleasures of real married love are chaste.
<p>- For those whom the Lord makes spiritual, married love becomes chaste.
<p>- The chastity of marriage comes through renouncing fornication.
<p>- "Chastity" does not apply to children before they feel sexual love.
<p>- "Chastity" does not apply to eunuchs.
<p>- "Chastity" does not apply to people who condone adultery.
<p>- Nor to those who abstain from adulteries for superficial reasons.
<p>- Nor to those who think marriage is unchaste.
<p>- Nor to celibates who renounce marriage. Marriage is better than celibacy.
<p>Stories:
<p>- News from Earth: Children reared by animals
<p>- A golden rain, and wives discussing marriage
<p><a href="156.htm">8. The Union of Souls and Minds by Marriage (n. 156)</a>
<p>Each sex inherently wants to join with the other.
<p>- Married love joins two souls and minds.
<p>- A wife's will joins a man's intellect, and vice versa.
<p>- Inclination to unite is constant for a wife but inconstant for a man.
<p>- The wife excites conjunction according to her love, and the man receives it according to his wisdom.
<p>- Conjunction becomes deeper forever.
<p>- A wife joins her husband's rational wisdom from within, his moral wisdom from outside.
<p>- A wife perceives and molds her husband's feelings.
<p>- Wives hide this perception from their husbands.- This perception is a wife's wisdom.
<p>- A wife thinks constantly about her husband.
<p>- A wife involves herself in what a husband wants.
<p>- She joins with him through the aura of her life.
<p>- The vigor of his manhood joins them, according to their spiritual love.
<p>- She accepts an image of her husband in herself, so she perceives his feelings.
<p>- Man and wife have different functions.
<p>- These join them together.
<p>- They can become more and more one person.
<p>- They can tell that they are one.
<p>- Real married love is a union of souls, minds, and bodies.
<p>- This love has innocence, peace, and friendship, and it brings down heavenly bliss.
<p>- Which is only in a marriage of one man with one wife.
<p>Stories:
<p>- Some misconceptions about life after death are dispelled
<p>- In married love, love and wisdom play like happy children
<p><a href="184.htm">9. Marriage Changes the Conditions of Men's and Women's Lives (n. 184)</a>
<p>- Life changes, from infancy to eternity.
<p>- One's spirit changes.
<p>- Men and women change differently.
<p>- Men's minds increase in light, women's in warmth.
<p>- Marriage changes the lives of men and women.
<p>- Their lives keep changing after marriage.
<p>- Their souls and minds are differently configured.
<p>- A woman is formed into a wife.
<p>- This is being created while the man is "sleeping."
<p>- The wife joins her disposition to the man's inner disposition.
<p>- Both dispositions become one.
<p>- The wife makes her husband's affections her own.
<p>- She accepts the output of his soul 
<p>- Thus a virgin becomes a wife and a man a husband.
<p>- More and more so.
<p>- They are continually perfected inwardly.
<p>- Children of truly married people inherit a marriage of good and truth in themselves.
<p>- Because a child's soul is from its father and is clothed by its mother.

<p><a href="234.htm">11. The Causes of Coldness, Separations, and Divorces in Marriages (n. 234)</a>
<p>Spiritual heat is love, spiritual cold is love removed.
<p>- Spiritual cold in marriage is separation of minds and souls.
<p>- There are inner, outer, and "contingent" causes.
<p>- The inner causes depend on religion.
<p>- One inner cause is rejection of religion by both partners.
<p>- Another is rejection of religion by one partner.
<p>- A third is having two different religions.
<p>- A fourth is religious falsity.
<p>- Causes of inner cold may not cause outer cold.
<p>- A difference in dispositions and manners causes outer cold.
<p>- So does thinking that the love in marriage is the same as the love in fornication.

<p>- There are causes of separation.
<p>- One is an unhealthy mind.

<p><a href="271.htm">12. The Reasons for a Pretense of Love, Friendship, and Thoughtfulness in Marriage (n. 271)</a>
<p>- In the world, couples can be outwardly compatible.
<p>- In the spiritual world people join according to inward affections.
<p>- In the world, affections leading to matrimony are ordinarily surface ones.
<p>- But in the absence of deeper feelings, marriage ties loosen.
<p>- Still, worldly marriages should last for life.
<p>- Outward feelings simulate the missing inner ones.
<p>- They create an appearance of love.
<p>- Appearances of love are commendable.
<p>- Pretenses of marriage are wise and just.
<p>- They have the wisdom of expedience.

<p>Stories:
<p>- Seven wives in a rose garden discuss love
<p>- The same wives discuss women's prudence
<p><a href="295.htm">13. Commitments and Weddings (n. 295)</a>
<p>The man, not the woman, chooses.
<p>- It is proper for the man, not the woman, to court.
<p>- A woman should consult her parents or guardians.
<p>- The couple should exchange pledges.
<p>- Consent should be confirmed by a solemn commitment.
<p>- Commitment prepares both for married love.
<p>- It joins their minds before their bodies.

<p>- Physical union is improper during engagement.
<p>- After engagement, there should be a wedding.
<p>- But first, a marriage agreement should be settled and witnessed.
<p>- The marriage should be declared sacred by a minister.
<p>- The wedding should be celebrated with good fellowship.
<p>- After the wedding, the spiritual marriage is completed by bodily marriage.
<p>- These are the proper stages of development in married love.
<p>- Otherwise love burns out and is squandered.

<p>- Divine Providence in marriage, discussed in a garden
<p><a href="317.htm">14. Remarriage (n. 317)</a>

<p>- Nothing prohibits remarriage if there was not married love.
<p>- If there was, a partner does not want to remarry.
<p>- Marriage of a young man with a virgin is different from marriage of a young man with a widow.

<p>- Can women who love their own beauty, and men who love their own intelligence, love one another?
<p><a href="332.htm">15. Polygamy (n. 332)</a>
<p>Only with one wife are two one flesh.
<p>- Similarly, the blessings of married love.
<p>- The Lord gives these to people who approach Him and live by His teachings.
<p>- So real married love is available only for Christians.
<p>- This is why a Christian may take only one wife. If he takes more, he commits worldly and spiritual adultery.
<p>- The Israelites were allowed more wives, because they did not have Christianity.
<p>- Mohammedans are allowed more wives, because they do not recognize the Lord Jesus Christ as one with Jehovah the Father.
<p>- The Mohammedan heaven is outside the Christian heaven.
<p>- Polygamy is lascivious.
<p>- For polygamists, the chastity, purity, and holiness of marriage are not possible.
<p>- Polygamists cannot become spiritual.
<p>- Polygamy is not a sin for those who do it from religion.
<p>- Nor for those who do not know about the Lord.
<p>- Mohammedan polygamists are saved if they acknowledge God and live by the law.
<p>- But in heaven they are not with Christians.
<p>Stories:
<p>- Self-importance
<p>- Married angels never have impotency

<p>- Zeal is spiritual.
<p>- Zeal is as good or bad as the love it comes from.
<p>- But the outward appearance is the same.
<p>- The zeal of a good love harbors love, but that of a bad love harbors hate.
<p>- The zeal of married love is called jealousy.
<p>- Jealousy is like a fire flaring out and a fear of loss.
<p>- Spiritual jealousy and worldly jealousy.
<p>- Jealousy is anguish lest married love become divided and perish.
<p>- Partners who do not love each other have jealousy, too.
<p>- Some people have no jealousy.
<p>- Jealousy for mistresses is not the same as jealousy for wives.
<p>- Animals and birds also have jealousy.
<p>- Jealousy is different in husbands than in wives.

<p>- Does nature give life, or life give nature?
<p>- Orations on the source of beauty
<p><a href="385.htm">17. Married Love's Connection with Love for Children (n. 385)</a>
<p>An aura of having offspring and an aura of protecting them radiate from the Lord.
<p>- They converge with the aura of married love.
<p>- They influence everything in heaven and on earth 
<p>- The aura of love for children is an aura of protecting and nourishing.
<p>- It affects good and bad people alike.
<p>- It affects mothers, and through them, fathers.
<p>- It is an aura of innocence and peace from the Lord.
<p>- It influences children, and through them, parents.
<p>- It influences the parents' souls, especially through touch.
<p>- As children grow less innocent, the affection diminishes.
<p>- Parents are conscious of innocence and peace in their children.
<p>- This aura progresses step by step.
<p>- Love for children reaches downward, not upward.
<p>- Wives' love before conception is different than after.
<p>- Married love is connected with love for children for spiritual, and therefore for natural, reasons.
<p>- Love for children is different in spiritual partners than in earthly ones.
<p>- In spiritual partners it is from inner things, in earthly partners it is from outer things.
<p>- So it is in partners who love each other and in those who do not.
<p>- Love for children remains after death, especially in women.
<p>- They bring up children under the Lord's guidance, as in the world.
<p>- The Lord sees to it that the children become angels.
<p>Story:
<p>- Everything in the natural world comes through the spiritual world from the Lord
<p><a href="423.htm">Part 2 : The Foolish Pleasures of Illicit Love (n. 423)</a>
<p>18. Illicit Love and Married Love Are Opposite
<p>- Without knowing what married love is, you cannot know what illicit love is.
<p>- It is opposite to married love.
<p>- It is opposite as a worldly person is opposite to a spiritual person.
<p>- Or as a "marriage" of evil and lies is opposite to a marriage of good and truth.
<p>- Or as hell is opposite to heaven.
<p>- The filthiness of hell comes from illicit love, the cleanness of heaven from married love.
<p>- The same goes for uncleanness and cleanness in the church.
<p>- Illicit love makes a person less a person and less a man, but married love makes a person more a person and more a man.
<p>- There is an aura of illicit love and an aura of married love.
<p>- That of illicit love comes from hell, and that of married love from heaven.
<p>- These two auras meet but do not mingle.
<p>- People are in a balance between these two auras.
<p>- They can turn to whichever they choose.
<p>- Each aura brings delight.
<p>- The delights of illicit love are physical, the delights of married love spiritual, even in the body.
<p>- Illicit love's delights are foolish, married love's sensible.
<p>Story:
<p>- An attempt to discuss illicit love with angels
<p><a href="444.htm">19. Fornication (n. 444)</a>
<p>Fornication relates to sexual love.
<p>- It begins when a boy starts to think and act from his own intellect.
<p>- It belongs to the worldly side of a person.
<p>- It is a desire, but not for adultery.
<p>- In some people, love for the other sex cannot be restrained.
<p>- This is why brothels are tolerated.
<p>- A desire for fornication is a small matter if married love is preferred.
<p>- It is serious if it has adultery in view.
<p>- It is worse if it desires promiscuity and defloration.
<p>- In its beginning it is neutral between illicit love and married love. Watch out that married love is not lost.
<p>- Marriage is the treasure of human life and of Christianity.
<p>- Marriage can be protected.
<p>- A mistress is preferable to roving passions.
<p>Story:
<p>- A new arrival in the spiritual world learns what is delightful in heaven and in hell
<p><a href="462.htm">20. Having a Concubine (n. 462)</a>
<p>- Two types of concubinage.
<p>- Having a concubine and a wife is impermissible for Christians.
<p>- It is polygamy.
<p>- It destroys marriage.
<p>- It is permissible when separated from a wife.
<p>- Legitimate reasons for divorce are reasons for concubinage.
<p>- As are just reasons for separation.
<p>- Some reasons are valid, some specious.
<p>- Valid, serious reasons are the just reasons.
<p>- Specious reasons only seem just.
<p>- Those who have a concubine for legitimate, just, and important reasons may still have love for marriage.
<p>- While concubinage continues, sexual union with a wife is not permissible.
<p>Story:
<p>- An adulterer views heaven and sees the opposite of what is really there
<p><a href="478.htm">21. Adultery: Its Types and Levels (n. 478)</a>
<p>There is a simple, double, and triple adultery.
<p>- Simple adultery is between a single person and another person's spouse.
<p>- Double adultery involves a husband and another's wife, or vice versa.
<p>- Triple adultery is adultery with blood relations.
<p>There are four levels of adultery.
<p>- Adulteries of the first level do not involve intellect.
<p>- These are mild.
<p>- Adulteries of the second level involve passion and intellect.
<p>- These are blameworthy precisely as intellect favors them afterwards.
<p>- Adulteries rationalized as not being sinful are of the third level.
<p>- They are serious in the measure that they are confirmed.
<p>- Adulteries of the fourth level are committed with intention and represented as lawful.
<p>- These are the most serious.
<p>- Adulteries of the third and fourth level are sinful to the extent that they involve intellect and will.
<p>- They make people worldly, sense - oriented and physical - minded.
<p>- So the people reject religion.
<p>- Yet they retain their rational capacity.
<p>- But they abuse that rationality inwardly.
<p>Story:
<p>- Three ministers mobbed for denouncing adultery
<p><a href="501.htm">22. Lust for Defloration (n. 501)</a>
<p>- A virgin's condition before and after marriage.
<p>- Virginity is a token of married love.
<p>- Defloration is the act of a thief. Deflorators suffer a serious fate.
<p><a href="506.htm">23. Lust for Variety (n. 506)</a>

<p>- It is a love and a loathing for the other sex.
<p>- It eliminates the love of marriage.
