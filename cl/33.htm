<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #33 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>33. The result of being so formed in the beginning is that the male is by birth a creature of the intellect, the female a creature of the will, or to put the same thing another way, the male acquires from birth an affection for knowing, understanding and being wise, and the female acquires from birth a love of joining herself with that affection in the male. Since what is within forms the outside so as to resemble itself, and the form of the male is that of the intellect, and the form of the female is that of love for it, this is why the male differs from the female in face, voice, and the rest of the body. He has a sterner face, a rougher voice and a stronger body, not to mention a bearded chin, so generally speaking a less beautiful form than the female. There are also differences in their gestures and behaviour. In short, they have no similarity, and yet every detail has the impulse towards union. In fact, there is masculinity in every part of the male, down to the smallest part of his body, and also in every idea he thinks of and every spark of affection he feels; and the same is true of the femininity of the female. Since therefore one cannot change into the other, it follows that after death the male is male and the female is female. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #33 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>33. It is owing to this original formation that a male is born intellect-oriented and that a female is born will-oriented, or in other words, that a male is born with an affection for knowing, understanding and becoming wise, while a female is born with a love for joining herself to that affection in the male.<p>Furthermore, because interior qualities form the exterior ones to their likeness, and the masculine form is a form of the intellect while the feminine form is a form of the love of the intellect, therefore the male has a different look, a different sound, and a different physique from the female. Namely, he has a tougher look, a rougher sound, and a stronger physique, and moreover his lower face is bearded. In general, he has a less beautiful form than the female. The two sexes also differ in behavior and manners. In short, nothing in the two sexes is the same, although there is nevertheless a capacity for conjunction in every detail.<p>Indeed, masculinity in the male is masculine in every part, even in the least part of his body, and also in every idea of his thought, and in every bit of his affection. So, too, with femininity in the female. And because one cannot as a consequence be converted into the other, it follows that after death a male is still male, and that a female is still female. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #33 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>33. From this original formation springs the phenomenon that masculinity is born to be intellect discerning and femininity is born to be will, or in other words, masculinity is born into an inclination toward knowledge, intellect, and wisdom, while femininity is born into a love of joining itself with that inclination in masculinity. And since what is inner forms what is outer in its own likeness, and the form of masculinity is the form of intellect, while the form of femininity is the form of loving it, this is why a male has a different face, a different voice, and a different body than a female, as everybody knows - a harder face, a rougher voice, and a stronger body, a:nd a bearded chin besides - a less beautiful appearance, by and large, than a female. Males and females also differ in behavior and habits. In a word, nothing about them is the same, but each and every particular offers conjunction.<p>Certainly masculinity in a male is masculine in all parts of his body, even the tiniest, and also in every idea of his thinking and every scrap of his feelings. The same goes for femininity in a female. And because the one cannot change itself into the other on that account, it follows that after death men are still male and women are female. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #33 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>33. From this primitive formation it follows, that the male is born intellectual and the female voluntary; or, what is the same thing, that the male is born into the affection of knowing, understanding, and being wise, and the female into the love of conjoining herself with that affection in the male. And because interiors form exteriors after their own likeness, and the masculine form is the form of the understanding, and the feminine the form of the love of that understanding, it follows that the male has a face, voice, and body different from the female; that is, a harder face, a harsher voice, and a stronger body, and, moreover, a bearded chin--in general, a form less beautiful than the female. They differ also in their attitudes and their ways. In a word, nothing whatever in them is alike; and yet, in their single parts, there is what is conjunctive; yea, in the male, the masculine is masculine in every part of his body even the most minute, and also in every idea of his thought, and in every grain of his affection; and so likewise, the feminine in the female. And since the one cannot be changed into the other, it follows that after death the male is a male and the female a female. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #33 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>33. It follows from this original formation that the male is by nature intellectual and the female volitional, or what is the same, he is born into an affection for knowing, understanding and being wise, and she into a love for uniting herself with that affection in the man. As interiors fashion exteriors to their likeness, and the masculine is a form of understanding and the feminine a form of the love of understanding, the male is different from the female in appearance, utterance and body, having a rougher appearance, a harsher utterance, and a stronger body, a bearded chin, too, in general a less beautiful form than woman. They also differ in bearing and ways. In a word, nothing is the same in them, though throughout there is what unites them. Indeed, the man is masculine throughout, in every least part of the body, in every idea of thought, in every particle of affection; similarly the woman is feminine. As one cannot be made into the other, it follows that after death male is male, and female female. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #33 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>33. It flows from this primitive formation that the male is born intellectual and the female volitional; or what is the same, that the male is born into the affection of knowing, understanding, and of growing wise, and the female into the love of conjoining herself with that affection in the male. And because the interiors form the exteriors to their likeness, and the masculine form is the form of the understanding, and the feminine form is the form of the love of that understanding, from this it comes that the male has a different face, a different voice, and a different body from the female; that is, a sterner face, a harsher voice, and a stronger body, and moreover a bearded chin - in general, a form less beautiful than the female. They differ also in gestures and in manners. In a word, nothing whatever is alike in them; and yet in every least thing there is what is conjunctive. Yea, in the male the masculine is masculine in every part of his body even the most minute; and also in every idea of his thought, and in every least impulse of his affection. And so is the feminine in the female. And as one cannot therefore, be changed into the other, it follows that after death the male is a male and the female is a female. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #33 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>33. Ex primitiva hac formatione fluit, quod Masculus nascatur Intellectualis, et quod Foemina nascatur Voluntaria, seu quod idem, quod Masculus nascatur in affectionem sciendi, intelligendi, et sapiendi, et quod Foemina nascatur in Amorem conjungendi se cum illa affectione in Masculo. Et quia Interiora ad similitudinem suam formant Exteriora, et Forma masculina est forma Intellectus, ac Forma foeminina est forma Amoris ejus, inde est quod Masculus sit alia facie, alio sono, et alio corpore, quam Foemina; nempe facie duriore, sono asperiore, et corpore fortiori, ac insuper mento barbato, in genere forma impulchriore, quam foemina; differunt etiam gestibus et moribus: verbo, non est quicquam simile, sed usque est conjunctivum in singulis; imo est masculinum in masculo, in omni parte, etiam in minima corporis ejus, masculinum, et quoque in omni idea cogitationis, et in omni mica affectionis ejus; similiter Foemininum in foemina; et quia sic unum non mutari potest in alterum, sequitur quod post mortem masculus sit masculus, et quod foemina sit foemina. </p>
