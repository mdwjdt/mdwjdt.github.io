<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第36节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>36、死后，人仍保留自己的爱，原因如34节所述，爱是人的生命，因此就是人自己。人还是自己的思维，因而是自己的聪明智慧，但这些都与他的爱合而为一。因为人出于爱并照着爱思考，若处于自由状态，他会出于爱并照着爱说话和行事。由此可见，爱是人生命的存在或本质，思维是生命的诞生或彰显。因此，思维所发出的言与行并非从思维流出，而是从爱藉着思维流出。我通过大量经历得知，死后，人不是他的思维，而是他的情感和由此而来的思维，或说他就是自己的爱和由此而来的聪明。死后他会脱去与他的爱不相协调的一切。事实上，他会将自己的爱相继表现在面部表情、语气、言语、行为和举止上。正因如此，整个天堂照各种对良善的爱之情感来排列，整个地狱则照各种对邪恶的爱之情感来排列。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>36、每个人的爱在死后还同样存在，因为这种爱是一个人的生命（如同34段中所讲的），因而，那时的他才是真正的人。人还由他的思想，以及他的聪明才智所决定，但这些与他的爱相统一。因为一个人根据他的爱而思考，事实上，若人能自由地行为，那么他的言行完全出自于他的爱。由此，我们可以了解，爱是生命的精髓，思想是他生命的表现。看似来自于思想的言行实际上是来自于爱，只是通过思想来表现。</p><p>我从大量的经历中得知，死后一个人并不是他的思想，而是他的情感以及由这种情感而来的思想。也就是说，他是他的爱的形式，也就是他的才智的形式。我还得知，死后，人会与一切不与一他的爱不相符的东西相分离，他会渐渐地在面容、声音、言行上与他的爱相符。因此，天堂因对善的情感而形成。地狱因对恶的情感而形成。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #36 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>36. The reason why each person retains his love after death is that love is a person's life (as stated in <a href="34.htm">34</a> above), and in consequence is the person himself. A person is also his thought, and so his intelligence and wisdom; but these make one with his love. For it is love which is the origin and determinant of a person's thought; in fact, if he has freedom, of his speech and actions too. From this it may be seen that love is the being or essence of a person's life, and thought is the resultant coming-into-being or arising of his life. Speech therefore and actions, which derive from thought, are not so much from thought as from love by means of thought. Much experience has allowed me to know that after death a person is not his thought, but his affection and the thought which comes from it; or he is his love and the intelligence which comes from it. Also, a person after death puts off everything not in harmony with his love; in fact, he successively puts on the face, voice, speech, gestures and behaviour which fit the love of his life. Thus it is that the whole of heaven is arranged in accordance with all the different kinds of affection of the love for good, and the whole of hell in accordance with all the kinds of affection of the love for evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #36 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>36. Everyone's own love remains in him after death for the reason that love is a person's life (as just said above, no. <a href="34.htm">34</a>), and consequently it is the real person. A person is also what he thinks, thus what his intelligence and wisdom are, but these are united with his love. For a person thinks because of his love and according to it; in fact, if he is free to do so, he speaks and acts from it. From this it can be seen that love is the being or essence of a person's life, and that thought is the resulting expression or manifestation of his life. Speech and action that spring from thought, therefore, do not spring from thought, but from love acting through thought.<p>I have been granted to know from a good deal of experience that a person after death is not what he thinks but what his affection is and what he thinks from that, which is to say that he is what his love is and subsequently his intelligence. I have also been granted to know that after death a person puts away everything that is not in harmony with his love; indeed, that he progressively takes on the look, sound, speech, behavior and manners of his life's love. It is for this reason that the whole of heaven has been set in order according to all the varieties in the affections connected with the love of good, and that the whole of hell has been arranged according to all the affections connected with the love of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #36 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>36. It is because love is a person's life (see no. <a href="34.htm">34</a>), and therefore is the person himself, that everyone's love continues after death. A person's thought, and therefore what he knows and his perception, are also the person, but they work together with his love, since the person thinks on account of love and according to it. In fact, he speaks and acts from it if he can. This shows that love is the being of a person's life, or the essential reality of it, and that thinking from love is the visible existence or manifestation of his life. So the speech and action that spring from thinking do not really spring from thinking, but from love, and flow out through thought.<p>From many experiences I have found out that after death people are not their thoughts, but they are their feelings and the thought from them - in other words, they are their love and the understanding that comes from it. After death people reject everything not in harmony with their love. In fact, they gradually assume the face, voice, speech, gestures, and manners of their life's love. This is why all heaven is arranged according to all the varieties of dispositions that go with loving good, and all hell according to all the dispositions that go with loving evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #36 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>36. The reason why his own love remains with every man after death is because, as said above (no. <a href="34.htm">34</a>), love is man's life, and hence is the man himself. A man is also his own thought, and so his own intelligence and wisdom, but these make one with his love; for man thinks from his love and according to it, yea, if in freedom, he speaks and acts from it and according to it. From this it can be seen, that love is the esse or essence of a man's life, and that thought is the existere or existence of his life therefrom. Therefore the speech and action, which flow forth from thought, flow not from the thought but from the love by means of the thought. It has been given me to know from much experience, that after death man is not his thought but his affection and the thought therefrom, or that he is his love and his intelligence therefrom; and that after death he puts off everything that is not concordant with his love; yea, that he successively puts on the face, tone, speech, gestures, and manners of his life's love. Hence it is that the entire heaven is ordinated according to all the varieties of the affections of the love of good; and the entire hell according to all the [varieties of the] affections of the love of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #36 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>36. The love which is one's own remains with one after death, because, as we said above (<a href="34.htm">34</a>), love is man's life, and is the very man. A man is his own thought, too, that is, his own intelligence and wisdom, but in the degree in which these make one with his love. For we think from and according to our love, and when in freedom, also speak and act from it. Hence we may see that love is the esse or essence of human life, and thought the existere or standing-forth of it. Speech and action, then, flowing from thought, do not flow from thought, but from love through thought. I have been given by much experience to know that the human being after death is not his own thought, but the affection which is his and the thought therefrom, or the love which is his and the intelligence therefrom; likewise, that after death he puts off everything not congruous with his love, and indeed, gradually puts on the appearance, voice, speech, bearing and ways of the love which is his. Hence all heaven is arranged according to the varieties of the affections of the love of what is good, and all hell according to the affections of the love of what is evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #36 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>36. Because love is man's life, as has been stated just above (n. <a href="34.htm">34</a>), and thence is the man himself, therefore, his own love remains with every man after death. A man is also his own thought, and so his own intelligence and wisdom; but these form one with his love. For a man thinks from his love and according to it, yea, if he is in freedom he speaks and acts from and according to it. Whence it may be seen that love is the esse or essence of a man's life, and that thought is the existere or existence of his life therefrom. Speech and action therefore, which flow forth from thought, do not flow really from the thought, but from the love by the thought. It has been given me to know from much experience that man after death is not his own thought, but is his own affection and the thought therefrom, or that he is his own love and intelligence thence; and that after death man puts off everything that does not accord with his love; yea, that he successively puts on the face, tone of voice, speech, gesture, and manner of his life's love. Hence it is that the universal heaven is disposed in order according to all the varieties of the affections of the love of good; and the universal hell according to all the affections of the love of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #36 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>36. Quod suus Amor apud unumquemvis post mortem maneat, est quia Amor est vita hominis, ut mox supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_36/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_34" target=_top>34</a>. dictum est, et inde est ipse homo. Est homo etiam sua Cogitatio, ita sua Intelligentia et Sapientia, sed hae unum faciunt cum ejus Amore; nam homo ex Amore suo et secundum illum cogitat, imo si in libero est, loquitur et agit; ex quo videri potest, quod Amor sit Esse seu essentia vitae hominis, et quod Cogitatio sit Existere seu existentia vitae ejus inde, quare loquela et actio, quae profluunt ex Cogitatione, non profluunt ex cogitatione, sed ex Amore per cogitationem: ex multa experientia scire datum est, quod homo post mortem non sit sua Cogitatio, sed quod sit sua Affectio et inde cogitatio, seu quod sit suus Amor et inde intelligentia; tum quod homo post mortem exuat omne quod non concordat cum ejus Amore, imo quod successive induat faciem, sonum, loquelam, gestus, et mores amoris suae vitae: inde est, quod universum Coelum secundum omnes varietates affectionum Amoris boni sit ordinatum, ac universum Infernum <sup>1</sup>secundum omnes affectiones amoris mali.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: Inferuum </p>
