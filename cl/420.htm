<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第420节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>420、“自然界能以功用为目的，并将功用排列成次序和形式吗？只有一位智者才能做到这一切；除了拥有无限智慧的神外，没有人能排列并形成整个宇宙。还有谁能预见并供应满足人类衣食所需的一切？食物和衣服皆出自土地的出产和动物。其中一个奇迹是：那些被称为蚕的不起眼的小虫子，居然用蚕丝给男男女女，上至国王王后，下至男仆女佣披上衣裳，华美地装扮他们。或像蜜蜂这样卑微的小虫子都会提供照明用的蜂蜡，为教堂和宫廷贡献光辉。这些以及许多其它事实都是权威性的证据，证明正是主出于祂自己经由灵界运作，才产生了可见于自然界的一切事物。”</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>420、自然怎么会有产生有用作用的意图呢。怎么会因此而形成各种形式呢？只有神才会如此地按排世界，神拥有智慧，有谁能预见并提供给人类来自于自然的衣和食呢？</p><p>从这些奇迹中我们看到小小的蚕给世人提供了衣物，象蜜蜂一样的昆虫使宫殿建筑充满光彩。</p><p>以上奇迹是主通过精神世界中我见过在世间时只相信自然的人。在精神世界的光中，他们的智慧下层是开启着的，上层是关闭着的。因为他们只向下看到尘世，而没有向上看到天国。在知觉之上，也就是才智的最低层，有一层发着白光的地狱之火。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #420 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>420. 'Surely nature cannot have a purpose as its aim and arrange purposes into successions and forms? Only a wise being can do this; and no one but God, whose wisdom is infinite, could so arrange and form the universe. How could anyone else foresee and provide all that is needed by human beings for food and clothing, food from the fruits of the earth and from animals, and clothing from the same sources? One of the wonders is that the lowly insects called silk-worms clothe with silk and magnificently adorn both women and men, from queens and kings to maids and menservants. Or that such lowly insects as bees are should supply wax for illumination, to contribute their brilliance to churches and courts? These and many more facts are authoritative proofs that the Lord's workings produce from Himself through the spiritual world everything to be seen in nature. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #420 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>420. Can (nature) have as an end a useful purpose, and dispose useful endeavors into patterns and forms? No one can do this but one who is wise; and no one can so order and form the universe but God, who has infinite wisdom. Who else...can foresee and provide all those things which serve mankind for food and clothing - food from the fruits of the earth and from animals, and clothing from the same sources?<p>Among the wonders we see is that those lowly larvae we call silkworms should with their silk clothe and magnificently adorn both women and men, from queens and kings to maidservants and menservants; and that lowly insects such as bees should supply wax for the lights by which temples and courts are filled with a radiant splendor.<p>These wonders and more are visible proofs that it is the Lord acting from Himself through the spiritual world who produces all the phenomena which (are found) in nature. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #420 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>420. "Can nature have a useful activity as its purpose and put useful activities into series and forms? This is impossible except for one with wisdom, and no one but God, Who has infinite wisdom, can arrange and form a universe this way. Who else can foresee and provide all the things that are food and clothing for people food from the fruits of the earth and from the animals, and clothing from the same? Among the wonders is the fact that the lowly worms called silkworms clothe and splendidly adorn with silk both women and men from queens and kings to maids and footmen, and that lowly insects called bees freely supply wax for the lights that keep cathedrals and palaces in splendor. These and many other things are outstanding evidence that the Lord does all the things in nature from Himself, through the spiritual world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #420 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>420. "Can nature have use for an end, and arrange uses into orders and forms? None can do this save one who is wise; and none can thus ordinate and form the universe save God who has infinite wisdom. Who else Can foresee and provide all those things which are food and clothing for mankind, food from the fruits of the earth and from animals, and clothing from the same? It is among marvels that those lowly worms called silkworms should clothe in silk and magnificently adorn both women and men, from queens and kings to maidservants and menservants; and that lowly worms which become bees should supply wax for the lights from which churches and palaces are in their splendor. These and many other things are outstanding proofs that the Lord operates all things which are in nature from Himself through the spiritual world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #420 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>420. "Can nature have use in view as an end? Or arrange uses into orders and forms? Only one who is wise can do so. None but God, who has infinite wisdom, can thus ordinate and form a whole universe. Who else could foresee and provide everything men need for food and raiment - food from the fruits of the earth and from animals, and raiment from them, too? It is among earth's marvels that the lowly worms called silk-worms clothe with silk and magnificently adorn both women and men, from queens and kings down to maidservants and menservants; and that creatures as humble as bees furnish wax for the lights by which temples and palaces are made brilliant. These and many other facts are conspicuous proofs that the Lord operates all things in nature from Himself through the spiritual world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #420 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>420. 'Can nature have use as an end? And dispose uses into orders and forms? This none but one who is wise can do. And none but God, who has infinite wisdom, can thus ordinate and form a universe. Who else could foresee and provide all things that men require for food and for raiment, food from the fruits of the earth and from animals, and raiment from the same? It is among the marvels that the vile caterpillars called silk-worms, clothe with silk and magnificently adorn both women and men, from queens and kings down to maidservants and menservants; and that creatures so lowly as bees furnish wax for the lights from which temples and palaces have their brightness. These facts, and many more, are conspicuous proofs that the Lord, for Himself through the spiritual world operates all things that are in nature. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #420 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>420. "Num Natura pro fine potest habere usum, ac disponere usus in ordines et formas; hoc non potest nisi quam Sapiens; ac Universum ita ordinare et formare, non potest nisi Deus, Cui Infinita Sapientia est; quis alius potest praevidere et providere omnia illa quae victus et amictus sunt hominibus, victus ex fructibus terrae et ex animalibus, ac vestitus ex iisdem. Inter mirabilia est, quod viles illi vermes, qui vocantur bombyces, serico vestirent et magnifice ornarent et foeminas et viros a Reginis et Regibus usque ad ancillas et famulos: et quod viles vermes, qui sunt apes, suppeditarent ceras pro luminaribus, ex quibus Templa et Aulae in splendore sunt. Haec et plura sunt auctoramenta exstantia, quod Dominus a Se per Mundum Spiritualem operetur omnia quae in Natura sunt. </p>
