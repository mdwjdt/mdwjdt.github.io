<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第十六章  嫉妒</h4><p>357、本章之所以论述嫉妒，是因为这也属于婚姻之爱。不过，嫉妒有正当和非正当之分；正当的嫉妒存在于彼此恩爱的夫妻当中。对这些人来说，嫉妒是一种正当和谨慎的热情，以免他们的婚姻之爱遭到侵犯；如果这爱遭到侵犯，他们会感受到正当的悲伤。但是，非正当的嫉妒可见于那些生性多疑，并且由于血液的粘性和胆汁性而患有心理疾病的人当中。此外，有些人把所有嫉妒都算作一种毛病；这些人主要是通奸者，他们甚至辱骂正当的嫉妒。嫉妒这个词源自热情，热情也有正当和非正当两种类型或形像。我将在下文按以下顺序揭示这些区别：<br><br>⑴就本身而言，热情就像熊熊燃烧的爱之火。<br><br>⑵爱的燃烧或火焰，也就是热情，是一种属灵的燃烧或火焰，是在爱遭到骚扰和攻击时产生的。<br><br>⑶人的热情取决于他的爱之性质，因此，热情因着他的爱是善是恶而各不相同。<br><br>⑷善爱的热情和恶爱的热情表面相似，但内在完全不同。<br><br>⑸善爱的热情将爱和友谊藏在里头，但恶爱的热情将仇恨和报复藏在里头。<br><br>⑹婚姻之爱的热情被称为嫉妒。<br><br>⑺嫉妒就像反对那些攻击对配偶的爱情之人的一团烈火，又像对失去那爱情的一种恐惧。  <br><br>⑻一夫一妻者的嫉妒是属灵的，一夫多妻者的嫉妒是属世的。<br><br>⑼对彼此温柔相爱的夫妻来说，嫉妒是一种出于正当理由的正当悲伤，唯恐他们的婚姻之爱破裂，因而灭亡。<br><br>⑽对彼此不相爱的夫妻来说，嫉妒是由众多原因引起的；有些情况下，嫉妒是由各种心理疾病引起的。<br><br>⑾有些情况下根本没有嫉妒，这同样出于各种原因。<br><br>⑿由情妇所引发的嫉妒也是有的，但在性质上不同于由妻子所引发的。<br><br>⒀甚至动物和鸟类当中也有嫉妒。<br><br>⒁男人和丈夫所感觉到的嫉妒不同于女人和妻子所感觉到的。<br><br>现逐一解读上述要点。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><h4 align="center">关于嫉妒</h4><p>357、在此谈到嫉妒是因为这也与婚姻之爱相连。嫉妒可能是正当的和非正当的。在相互相爱的配偶中嫉妒是正当的。在他们当中，嫉妒可以避免他们的婚姻之爱受到冲击，当爱受到冲击时，他们会感到苦恼。相反，非正当的嫉妒刚存在于那些天性多疑的人中，他们属于胆汁质，头脑上有病。</p><p>一些人认为嫉妒是一种失败。尤其是那些好淫乱的人，他们会对正当的嫉妒恶言相击。嫉妒一词来自于热情一词。它的后缀表明其性质，这一后缀包括正当和非正当的嫉妒。</p><p>关于二者的区虽，将按以下指顺序讲述：</p><p>（1）从其自身讲，热情是指燃烧的爱之火。</p><p> （2）爱之火也就是热情一种精神的火，因对爱人的攻击而产生。</p><p> （3）一个人的热与他的爱一样，当他的爱是善的时，热情是这样的，当爱是恶的时，热情则又是一样。</p><p> （4）善的爱的热情和恶的爱的热情在外在上是类似的，但在内在上是完全不同的。</p><p>（5）在善的爱的热情这中是友谊和爱，在恶的爱的热情之中是恨和敌意。</p><p>（6）婚姻之爱的热情被称为嫉妒。</p><p>（7）嫉妒是反抗侵害了与婚姻中的配偶所分享的爱的一种火，是对失去婚姻之爱的畏惧。</p><p>（8）嫉妒在一夫一妻者中是精神的，在一夫多妻中都是自然性的。</p><p>（9）在彼此相爱的配偶中，嫉妒是一种有正当原因的苦恼，因为害怕他们的婚姻之爱会受害并丧失。</p><p>（10）在彼此不相爱的人中，嫉妒产生的原因有好多，一些情况下是出于某种心理疾病。</p><p>（11）一些人没有一点嫉妒感，这也有好多原因。</p><p>（12）情人中的嫉妒与妻子中的嫉妒是不同的。</p><p>（13）动物、鸟类中也存在嫉妒。</p><p>（14）男人或丈夫中的嫉妒与女人或妻子中的嫉妒不同。</p><p>下面分别做以下解释：</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #357 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>357. CHAPTER XVI. JEALOUSY<p>This chapter deals with jealousy, since this too relates to conjugial love. But there is justified and unjustified jealousy, justified with couples who love each other. These have a justified and prudent zeal to guard against any violation of their conjugial love, and they feel justified grief if it is violated. But unjustified jealousy is found among those who are naturally suspicious, and are sick in mind as the result of viscous and bilious blood. Besides, some people class any jealousy as a fault. These are primarily fornicators, who hurl abuse even at justified jealousy. The name jealousy is derived from zeal, <sup >1</sup>and there exists a model or image of justified and unjustified zeal. But these distinctions will be revealed in the following pages, in this order:<p>(i) Zeal regarded in itself is like the fire of love when it blazes up.<p>(ii) The blaze or flame of that love, which is zeal, is a spiritual blaze or flame, which arises when love is attacked and assaulted.<p>(iii) A person's zeal depends upon the nature of his love, so it is different if his love is good or if it is evil.<p>(iv) The zeal of a good love and that of an evil love are outwardly similar, but utterly different inwardly.<p>(v) The zeal of a good love conceals within it love and friendship, but the zeal of an evil love conceals within it hatred and revenge.<p>(vi) The zeal of conjugial love is called jealousy.<p>(vii) Jealousy is like a blazing fire against those who attack love for a married partner, and it is like a dreadful fear of the loss of that love.<p>(viii) The monogamous have spiritual jealousy, the polygamous natural jealousy.<p>(ix) Jealousy in the case of married couples who love each other dearly is a justified grief arising from a proper reason, a fear that their conjugial love may be split and thus destroyed.<p>(x) Jealousy in the case of married couples who do not love each other is due to a number of reasons; in some cases it may be due to various kinds of mental illness.<p>(xi) In some cases there may be no jealousy at all, again for a number of reasons.<p>(xii) There is also jealousy inspired by mistresses, but this is different in nature from that inspired by wives.<p>(xiii) There is even jealousy among animals and among birds.<p>(xiv) The jealousy felt by men and husbands is different from that felt by women and wives.<p>An explanation of these points now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #357 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>357. JEALOUSNESS<p>We take up jealousness here, because it, too, is connected with conjugial love. Jealousness, however, may be just or unjust. Jealousness is just in married partners who love each other. In them it is a just and prudent zeal to keep their conjugial love from being violated, and a just anguish therefore if it is violated. An unjust jealousness, on the other hand, is found in people who are by nature suspicious, and who, from a viscidity and biliousness of the blood, suffer a sickness of the mind.<p>In addition, by some all jealousness is regarded as a failing. Especially is it so regarded by the licentious, who hurl vituperations against even just jealousness. Yet jealousness as a term derives from the same root as zeal, with a suffix (-ness) denoting quality; and it is the quality or mark of both a just zeal and an unjust zeal.<p>But the differences between these two will be unfolded in the succeeding discussions, which we will present in the following order:<p>1. Viewed in itself, zeal is, so to speak, the fire of love set ablaze.<p>2. The blaze or flame of that love - which zeal is - is a spiritual blaze or flame, arising in response to an attack or assault on the love.<p>3. A person's zeal is as his love is, thus of one character when the person's love is good, and of another character when the person's love is evil.<p>4. The zeal of a good love and the zeal of an evil love are in outward respects alike, but in inward respects entirely unalike.<p>5. The zeal of a good love harbors in its inner aspects friendship and love; but the zeal of an evil love harbors in its inner aspects hatred and vengeance.<p>6. The zeal of conjugial love is called jealousness.<p>7. Jealousness is a kind of blazing fire against those who attack the love shared with a married partner, and a kind of trembling fear at the thought of losing that love.<p>8. Jealousness is spiritual in character in monogamists, and natural in character in polygamists.<p>9. In married partners who love each other tenderly, jealousness is a just anguish in accord with sound reason, that their conjugial love not be sundered and thus perish.<p>10. In married partners who do not love each other, jealousness arises for a number reasons; in some owing to a sickness of the mind of one kind or another.<p>11. Some people do not have any jealousness in them, also for a variety of reasons.<p>12. One finds a jealousness also in regard to mistresses, but not such as arises in regard to wives.<p>13. Jealousness is found also in animals and birds.<p>14. Jealousness in men and husbands is different from jealousness in women and wives.<p>Explanation of these statements now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #357 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>357. Chapter 16. Jealousy<p>Jealousy is discussed here because it, too, has to do with married love. But there is justified jealousy and unjustified jealousy.<p>Couples who love each other have justified jealousy. They have a proper and sensible zeal for keeping their married love from being injured, and from it a righteous grief if it is injured. But unjustified jealousy occurs among those who are naturally suspicious, and who have melancholy minds due to sluggish and bilious blood. And for another thing, some people consider all jealousy a fault. Fornicators do this especially. They even hurl reproaches at righteous jealousy.<p>Jealousy comes from [the Latin] “zeli typo”, or "image of zeal." There are justified and unjustified images or forms of zeal. But the differences will unfold in the topics that now follow, which they do in this order:<p>1. Zeal, viewed in itself, is like the fire of love flaring up.<p>2. The flaring up or flame of this love, which is zeal, is a spiritual flaring or flame springing from a threat to love and an assault on it.<p>3. The zeal a person has is like the love he has, which is to say it is one thing in someone whose love is good and another in someone whose love is bad.<p>4. The zeal of a good love and the zeal of a bad love are alike in outward appearance but totally different in inward appearance.<p>5. The zeal of a good love harbors love and friendship within it, but the zeal of a bad love harbors hate and revenge within it.<p>6. The zeal of married love is called jealousy.<p>7. Jealousy is like a fire flaring out against violators of love with a spouse, and it is like a bristling fear for the loss of that love.<p>8. Spiritual jealousy is found among monogamists, and worldly jealousy among polygamists.<p>9. In those partners who love each other tenderly, jealousy is a justified anguish, from sound reason, lest married love become divided and perish as a result.<p>10. Partners who do not love each other have jealousy for many reasons. With some it comes from various mental afflictions.<p>11. Some people do not have any jealousy, also for various reasons.<p>12. There is also jealousy for mistresses, but it is not the same kind as for wives.<p>13. Animals and birds also have jealousy.<p>14. Jealousy is different in men and husbands than in women and wives.<p>Now comes the explanation of these topics. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #357 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>357. JEALOUSY<p>Jealousy is here treated of because this also pertains to conjugial love. But there is a just jealousy and an unjust. Just jealousy exists with married partners who mutually love each other. With these, jealousy is a just and prudent zeal lest their conjugial love be violated; hence a just grief if it is violated. Unjust jealousy exists with those who are suspicious by nature and have a sickly mind arising from a viscous and bilious blood. Moreover, by some, all jealousy is accounted a fault; this is especially so with whoremongers who cast vituperations even upon just jealousy.<p>The word zelotypia (jealousy) is derived from zeli-typus, <sup >1</sup>and there is a type or image of a just zeal and of an unjust; but these distinctions shall be unfolded in what follows, and this in the following series:<p>I. That zeal, regarded in itself, is as the fire of love blazing.<p>II. That the burning or flame of the love, being its zeal, is a spiritual burning or flame arising from a molestation of the love, and an attack upon it.<p>III. That a man's zeal is such as his love is, thus of one kind with him whose love is good, and of another with him whose love is evil.<p>IV. That in outer manifestation, the zeal of a good love and the zeal of an evil love are alike, but inwardly they are wholly unlike.<p>V. That inwardly in the zeal of a good love lie love and friendship, but inwardly in the zeal of an evil love lie hatred and revenge.<p>VI. That the zeal of conjugial love is called jealousy.<p>VII. That jealousy is as a fire blazing out against those who molest the love with the partner, and as a dreadful fear for the loss of that love.<p>VIII. That jealousy is spiritual with monogamists, and natural with polygamists.<p>IX. That with married partners who tenderly love each other, jealousy is a just grief from sound reason, lest their conjugial love be divided and thus perish.<p>X. That with married partners who do not love each other, jealousy is due to many causes, and with some to various kinds of mental sickness.<p>XI. That with some there is no jealousy, and this also from various causes.<p>XII. That there is jealousy also for mistresses, but it is not of the same nature as for wives.<p>XIII. That there is jealousy also with beasts and birds.<p>XIV. That jealousy with men and husbands is different from jealousy with women and wives.<p>Now follows the explanation of the above.<p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In classical Latin zelotypia is used only in a few passages in Pliny and, as a Greek word, in Cicero. Both these authors use it as meaning simply jealousy. In the present text, it is given a special and limited definition "the zeal of conjugial love;" but the whole of the present chapter indicates that it is used to signify any jealousy, whether good or evil, that is connected with marriage. The ordinary Latin word for jealousy and the word used throughout Swedenborg's Writings is invidia, and the ordinary word for zeal is zelus. Zelotypia is used by Swedenborg only in the present chapter, and in 3 Adversaria no. 723, and in his translation of <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_5_15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a> in Doct. of the Lord no. 48 and Ind. Bib. s.v." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #357 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>357. XV. JEALOUSY<p>We treat of jealousy, too, because it also pertains to marital love. There are, however, a right and a wrong jealousy - a right jealousy with partners who love each other (with them it is a right and prudent zeal lest their marital love be violated and therefore a right grief, if it is); but a wrong jealousy with partners who are naturally suspicious or mentally ill because of viscous and bilious blood. All jealousy indeed is considered a vice by some, especially by whoremongers, who hurl vituperations at even a right jealousy. Still the word zelotypia (jealousy) comes from "type of zeal," and there is a type or form of right zeal and one of wrong zeal; but these distinctions will be unfolded in what now follows. We shall pursue the following order:<p>I. Viewed in itself, zeal is as it were the fire of love blazing.<p>II. This blazing or flaming of love, which is zeal, is a spiritual blazing or flaming, arising from infestation of love and from attack on it.<p>III. A man's zeal is such as his love is, one thing, therefore, with the man whose love is good, and another with the man whose love is evil.<p>IV. The zeal of a good love and the zeal of an evil love resemble each other in externals, but are utterly unlike in internals.<p>V. The zeal of a good love hides love and friendship in its internals, but the zeal of an evil love hides hatred and revenge in its internals.<p>VI. The zeal of marital love is called jealousy.<p>VII. Jealousy is like a blazing fire against those infesting the love of the partner, and like a horrid fear of losing that love.<p>VIII. Jealousy is spiritual with monogamists, and natural with polygamists.<p>Ix. In partners who love each other tenderly, jealousy is a right anxiety from sound reason lest marital love be sundered and thus perish.<p>X. In partners who do not love each other jealousy has a number of causes, arising with some from various kinds of mental illness.<p>XI. Some feel no jealousy at all, which is also from various causes.<p>XII. There is jealousy over mistresses, too, but not such as there is for wives.<p>XIII. Beasts and birds also feel jealousy.<p>XIV. Jealousy in men and husbands is different from jealousy in women and wives.<p>Explanation of these propositions follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #357 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>357. CONCERNING JEALOUSY.<p>Jealousy is here treated of because it also pertains to conjugial love. But there is a just and an unjust jealousy. Just jealousy is with married partners who mutually love each other; there is with them a just and prudent zeal lest their conjugial love be violated, and therefore, just grief if it be violated.<p>But unjust jealousy is with those who by nature are suspicious, and of sickly mind, from viscous and bilious blood. Moreover, all jealousy is by some considered a fault. Especially is it so by whoremongers, who cast blame upon just jealousy.<p>The word zelotypia, jealousy, is from zelus typos, and there is a type or form of zeal which is just, and a zeal which is unjust; and the differences shall now, in what follows, be unfolded. It shall be done in this order:<p>(1) That, regarded in itself, zeal is as the fire of love burning.<p>(2) That the burning or flame of that love, which is zeal, is a spiritual burning or flame, arising from an infestation and assault of the love.<p>(3) That the zeal of a man (Latin: homo) is of such kind as his love, thus of one kind with him whose love is good, and of another kind with him whose love is evil.<p>(4) That the zeal of good love and the zeal of evil love are alike in externals, but in internals they are altogether unlike.<p>(5) That the zeal of a good love in its internals conceals love and friendship; but that the zeal of an evil love in its internals conceals hatred and vindictiveness.<p>(6) That the zeal of conjugial love is called jealousy.<p>(7) That jealousy is as a flaming fire against those who infest the love with a married partner, and that it is as a horrible fear for the loss of that love.<p>(8) That there is spiritual jealousy with monogamists, and natural with polygamists<p>(9) That jealousy with married partners who tenderly love each other is a just grief, from sound reason, lest conjugial love be divided and so perish.<p>(10) That with married partners who do not love each other jealousy is from several causes; with some from a variety of infirmities of mind.<p>(11) That with some there is no jealousy, also from various causes.<p>(12) That there is also jealousy for concubines, but not of such kind as for wives.<p>(13) That there is jealousy also among beasts; and among birds.<p>(14) That jealousy with men and husbands is of another kind than with women and wives.<p>Now follows the explanation of these propositions. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #357 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>357. DE ZELOTYPIA <p>Agitur hic de Zelotypia, quia etiam pertinet ad Amorem conjugialem; sed datur Zelotypia justa et injusta; zelotypia justa apud conjuges, qui se mutuo amant, apud hos est illa justus et prudens Zelus, ne amor illorum conjugialis violetur, et inde justus dolor si violatur; at Zelotypia injusta datur apud illos, qui ex natura suspiciosi sunt, et quibus ex viscoso et bilioso sanguine est aegritudo mentis. Praeterea, omnis zelotypia a quibusdam censetur ut vitium; quod imprimis fit a scortatoribus, qui in zelotypiam justam etiam vituperia conjiciunt: derivatur usque Zelotypia ex Zeli typo, ac datur typus seu imago zeli justi et zeli injusti; sed discrimina illa in nunc sequentibus evolventur; quod fiet in hac serie: I. Quod Zelus in se spectatus sit sicut ignis amoris flagrans: II. Quod flagratio seu flamma illius amoris, quae est zelus, sit flagratio seu flamma spiritualis, oriunda ex infestatione et impugnatione amoris.<p>III. Quod Zelus homini sit, qualis est ejus amor, ita alius cui amor bonus est, et alius cui amor malus.<p>IV. Quod zelus amoris boni, et zelus amoris mali, in externis sibi similes sint, sed in internis prorsus dissimiles.<p>V. Quod zelus amoris boni in internis suis recondat amorem et amicitiam; at quod zelus amoris mali in internis suis recondat odium et vindictam.<p>VI. Quod zelus amoris conjugialis dicatur Zelotypia.<p>VII. Quod Zelotypia sit sicut flagrans ignis contra infestantes amorem cum conjuge; et quod sit sicut horridus timor pro jactura illius amoris.<p>VIII. Quod Zelotypia detur spiritualis apud monogamos, et naturalis apud polygamos.<p>IX. Quod Zelotypia apud illos conjuges qui se tenere amant, sit justus dolor ex sana ratione, ne amor conjugialis dividatur, et sic pereat.<p>X. Quod Zelotypia apud conjuges, qui se non amant, sit propter plures causas; apud quosdam ex varia aegritudine mentis.<p>XI. Quod apud quosdam non sit aliqua Zelotypia, etiam ex variis causis.<p>XII. Quod Zelotypia etiam sit pro pellicibus, sed non talis qualis est pro uxoribus.<p>XIII. Quod Zelotypia etiam sit apud bestias, et apud aves.<p>XIV. Quod Zelotypia apud viros et maritos alia sit, quam apud foeminas et uxores. Sequitur nunc horum Explicatio. </p>
