<h3 align="center" class="ired">《婚姻之爱》 第532节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>532、对此，我补充以下记事：<br><br>有一次，我在灵里被提入天使天堂和其中一个社群。然后，那里的一些智者来到我面前，问道：“地上有什么新闻？”我告诉他们：“新闻就是，主已揭开奥秘，这些奥秘远胜自有教会以来所揭示的一切奥秘。”他们又问：“都是些什么奥秘？”我回答说：“它们是：<br><br>⑴圣言在每一个细节上都包含一个对应于属世之义的属灵之义，并藉着属灵之义在教会之人与主之间形成一个联结。它还创造与天使的一种联系，圣言的神圣就居于属灵之义。<br><br>⑵构成属灵之义的这种对应关系已被披露出来。”天使问：“难道地上的居民以前不知道对应？”我说：“一无所知。这些奥秘现已埋藏了数千年，事实上，自约伯时代就遗失了。约伯和之前时代的人都视对应学为至高无上的学问，他们从中获得自己的智慧，因为他们由此认识属灵事物，就是天堂、因而教会的事物。但由于这门学问沦落为偶像崇拜的学问，于是，按照主的圣治，它被彻底抹去并遗失，以致没有人能看到它的任何踪迹。然而，如今主又将它披露出来，以便教会之人能与祂联结，并与天使相联。这一切通过圣言成就，圣言的每一个细节都是一种对应。”天使无比欢喜主乐意揭示这一伟大奥秘，它已深藏了数千年。他们说，成就这一切是为了建立在圣言基础上、现已走向末路的基督教会可以再次复活，并从主通过天堂呼吸。然后，他们询问洗礼与圣餐的含义是否藉着这门学问被揭示出来，因为到目前为止，人们对它们的揣测够多的了。我回答说，是的，已经揭示了。<br><br>⑶我继续说，在当今时代，主已揭示死后的生命。于是，天使说：“为何揭示死后的生命？谁不知道人死后还活着？”我回答说：“人们既知道，也不知道。他们说，死后活着的不是这个人，而是他的灵魂；这灵魂作为一个灵活着。而对于灵，他们所持的观念是，它就像风或以太；声称此人只有等到最后审判之日后才会作为人活着。那时，他们遗留在世上的肉体，无论被虫子、老鼠或鱼类吃得有多干净，仍会再次收聚起来并重建，以形成一个身体；人们便以这种方式复活。”天使说：“多么荒唐！谁不知道人死后仍作为一个人继续活着？唯一区别在于，那时他作为一个属灵人活着。谁不知道属灵人看属灵人，就像物质人看物质人？他们也意识不到任何区别，只是觉得自己处于更完美的状态。”<br><br>⑷天使又问：“关于我们的世界、天堂和地狱，他们都知道什么？”我说：“他们什么也不知道，但如今主已揭示了天使和灵人所生活的这个世界、因而天堂和地狱的各自性质；还揭示了天使并灵人都与人类相联，以及其它许多令人惊讶的事实。”天使很高兴主乐意揭示这些事，以便人类不再由于无知而质疑自己的不朽。<br><br>⑸我继续说：“如今，主已揭示，你们的世界有一轮不同于我们的太阳；你们世界的太阳是纯粹的爱，我们世界的太阳是纯粹的火。因此，你们的太阳所放射的一切因是纯粹的爱，所以其中含有某种生命之物，而我们的太阳所放射的一切因是纯粹的火，所以其中毫无生命；这就是属灵与属世之间区别的来源，迄今为止不为人知的这种区别也已被披露。从这些事实可以得知，以智慧照亮人类理解力的光从何而来，以爱点燃人类意愿的热又从何而来。<br><br>⑹另外，主还揭示，生命有三个层级，因而天堂也有三个层级；人的心智也被划分为这三层级，因此人对应于这三层天堂。”天使说：“难道他们以前不知道这些？”我回答，他们知道大和小之间的层级，丝毫不知在先和在后之间的层级。<br><br>⑺天使问，除了这些是否还有更多启示。我说：“还有很多，包括最后的审判；主，即祂是天地之神；神在位格和本质上都为一，神性三位一体在祂里面，祂就是主；以及主即将建立的新教会及其教义；圣经的神圣性。另外，《启示录》已被揭示，其中每一句经文若非靠着主，都不可能被揭示出来。还揭示了行星居民和宇宙中的星球；以及灵界的许多令人难忘和奇妙的事，智慧的大量细节便通过这些事从天上得以披露。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>532、在此做以下陈述：</p><p>一次我处于精神状态中被带到一个天国中的区域。其中的一些智者走出来问我：“你从世间带来了什么消息？”</p><p>我说：“主揭示了比从前任何秘密都珍贵的秘密。”</p><p>“是什么？”他们问。</p><p>我做了以下回答：</p><p>（1）在《圣经》中有一种精神上的意义与自然意义相对应；通过那一精神上的意义，教会中的人与主和天使相联系。这其中就是《圣经》的神圣性。</p><p>（2）与《圣经》中的精神含义相对应的因素也被揭示了。</p><p>天使问是否世间的人从前是否知道这种对应。我说他们一点也不知道。这被埋藏了数千年时间。即从约伯的时候起。生活在那时及从前的人中。对应关系是一种学问，人们从中得到智慧，因为人们从中得到一种与天国和教会相关的精神性的概念。但是这种学问后来被变成了一种偶象崇拜。于是主将它隐藏起来，没有人能再见到它。但主还是揭露了这一知识。以便世间的人能够与主和天使相连。这种联系是通过《圣经》产生的，在《圣经》中的一切都是一种对应的形式。</p><p>天使很高兴千百年来的秘密又为人所知了。天使还说之所以这样是为了建立在《圣经》之上的基督教会能够重生，并从天国的主那得到其精神。</p><p>他们又问是否洗礼和圣餐的意义也被揭露了呢。我回答说：“是的。”</p><p>我说（3）主揭露了人死的的情况。</p><p>天使说：“什么关于死后的生命？”谁不知道人死后还会继续存在？”</p><p>“他们既知道不知道，我答道‘他们说人死后不是人还活着，而是人的灵魂还活着。它做为精灵而存在。人们认为那一精灵就象风或幽灵一样。认为它直到最后的审判日时，才会又象人一样地生活。那时候，遗留在世间被虫吃掉了的躯体又会组合在一起，人就会重生。”</p><p>天使说：“你在讲什么呀？”谁不知道人死后还继续做为人而存在。唯一的区别就是人那时是个精神性的人。精神性的人视精神性的人就象物质性的人看物质性的人一样。没有一点区别，只不过那时他们是处于一种更完好的状态？”</p><p>天使又问：“人对我们的世界，天国和地狱有何了解呢？”</p><p>我说他们从前什么也不知道，但是（4）现在主已经揭示了天使和精灵生活的精神世界的性质，也揭示了天国和地狱的性质，以及天使和精灵与人相联。</p><p>天使们很高兴人们了解到这些。</p><p>我又说：“（5）”主还揭示在你们的世界中的太阳与世间的太阳不一样；你们的世界中的太阳是纯粹的爱；而世间的太阳却只是一团火；因为你们的太阳是爱，来自于那一太阳的一切都带有生命有关的东西。而来自于世间的太阳的一切却不是这样。这也正是精神性与自然性的区别产生的源泉。</p><p>因此，人们知道了人的才智来自于哪，人的爱来自于那。</p><p>另外，还揭示了（6）生命有三种程面，进而有三个天国；人的思想也分成同样的程面进而人类与三个天国相对应。</p><p>天使问：“人们从前不知道这些吗？”</p><p>天使又问还有哪些东西被揭示了呢？我说（7）关于最后的审判，关于主是天和地的神。神在人性和实质上是一体，在他其中存在着神圣的三位性，他就是主；还有主将创建的新教会，那一教会的信条；关于《圣经》的神圣性；以及主对天国的揭示。</p><p>还包括对宇宙中其它星球上的生物以及精神世界中的许多现象。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #532 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>532. To this I shall add an account of an experience.<p>I was once carried up in my spirit to the heaven of angels, and to one community there. Then some of their wise men came to me asking, 'What is the news from earth?' I told them that the news was that the Lord has revealed secrets far surpassing in excellence any so far revealed since the church began. 'What are they?' they asked.<p>I said that these were: (a) In every detail the Word contains a spiritual sense corresponding to the natural sense, and by means of that sense the Word forms a link between people in the church and the Lord. It also creates an association with angels, and the holiness of the Word resides in that sense.</p><p>[2] (b) The correspondences of which the spiritual sense is composed have been disclosed. 'Did not the inhabitants of the earth,' asked the angels, 'previously know about correspondences?' I told them that they knew nothing about them at all, since they had been lost to sight for thousands of years, in fact, since the time of Job. The people of that and earlier ages regarded a knowledge of correspondences as the supreme science, and it was the source of their wisdom, because it was knowledge of spiritual matters to do with heaven and so with the church. But because the science turned into an idolatrous one, it was by the Lord's Divine providence so thoroughly wiped out and lost that no one could see any trace of it. Now, however, it has been disclosed by the Lord, so that people belonging to the church may be linked with Him and associated with angels. Both of these take place by means of the Word, every detail of which is a correspondence.<p>The angels were extremely happy that it had pleased the Lord to reveal this great secret which has lain so deeply hidden for thousands of years. They said that the reason it was done was in order that the Christian church, which is based upon the Word, and is now at its end, should be revived and draw breath from the Lord through heaven. They enquired whether by this science it had been disclosed what was the meaning of baptism and the Holy Supper, which up to now have been the subject of so many speculations. I replied that it had.</p><p>[3] (c) I went on to say that at the present time the Lord had made a revelation about life after death. 'Why about life after death?' said the angels. 'Surely everyone knows that a person lives on after death?'<p>'They do and they do not,' I replied. 'They say that what lives on is not the person, but his soul, and this lives as a spirit. Their notion of a spirit is that it is like the wind or the ether; and they say that the person will only live after Judgment Day. At that time their bodily remains which they left in the world, however eaten away by worms, rats or fish, will be gathered together again and reconstructed to form a body; and this is how people will be brought to life again.'<p>'What an idea!' said the angels. 'Everyone knows that a person goes on living as a person after death with the single difference that he lives as a spiritual person, and a spiritual person can see another spiritual person, just as a material person can see a material person. They are unaware that there is any difference, except that they are in a more perfect state.'</p><p>[4] (d) The angels asked, 'What do they know of our world and about heaven and hell?' I replied that they knew nothing, but that at the present time the Lord had disclosed what that world where angels and spirits live is like, and so what heaven and hell are like. It has also been revealed that angels and spirits are linked with human beings, and many other surprising facts. The angels were glad that the Lord had been pleased to disclose such matters, so that mankind should no longer be driven by ignorance to doubt its own immortality.</p><p>[5] (e) I went on to speak of another matter revealed by the Lord at the present time. 'Your world has a different sun from ours. The sun of your world is undiluted love, the sun of our world is undiluted fire. Consequently all the radiation from your sun, being undiluted love, has something of life in it; all the radiation from ours, being undiluted fire, has no life in it. This is the origin of the distinction between spiritual and natural, a distinction hitherto unknown, which has also been disclosed. From these facts it has become known what is the source of the light which enlightens the human intellect with wisdom, and what is the source of the heat which fires the human will with love.</p><p>[6] (f) 'In addition it has been disclosed that there are three degrees of life, and that there are consequently three heavens, and a person's mind is divided into those three degrees, so that as a result a person corresponds to the three heavens.' 'Did they not know this before?' said the angels. I replied that they knew about the degrees between greater and less, but nothing about degrees between prior and posterior.</p><p>[7] (g) The angels asked whether there had been more revelations than these. I said there had. These were about the Last Judgment, and the Lord as being the God of heaven and earth; that God is one both in person and in essence, and in Him is the Divine Trinity, and He is the Lord. Other revelations were about the new church to be established by the Lord and the teaching of that church; about the holiness of Sacred Scripture (the Book of Revelation too had been revealed, and not a single verse in it could have been revealed except by the Lord); moreover, about the inhabitants of the planets and the other worlds in the universe. Furthermore many wonders and accounts of experiences had been reported from the spiritual world, by means of which a great deal of wisdom from heaven had been disclosed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #532 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>532. To this I will append the following narrative account:<p>I was once in my spirit taken up to the angelic heaven and into one of its societies; and some of the wise there then came to me and said, "What news do you have from earth?"<p>"This is new," I said, "that the Lord has revealed secrets which surpass in excellence all the secrets previously revealed from the inception of the Church."<p>"What are they?" they asked.<p>I said that they were the following:<p>1. That in the Word and in each and every particular of it, there is a spiritual meaning corresponding to the natural meaning; that through that spiritual meaning people of the church are conjoined with the Lord and affiliated with angels; and that in it lies the holiness of the Word.</p><p>[2] 2. That the corresponding elements of which the spiritual meaning of the Word consists have been disclosed.<p>The angels asked whether the inhabitants of the earth knew anything about correspondences before. I said that they knew nothing at all of them. They have lain hidden now for several thousand years, I said, namely from the time of Job. Among peoples who lived at that time and before, a study of correspondences was the study of studies, from which they had their wisdom, because they gained from it a concept of spiritual things having to do with heaven and so with the church. But because that study was turned into an idolatrous one, it was of the Lord's Divine providence so blotted out and lost that no one has seen any trace of it. However, knowledge of it has nevertheless now been disclosed by the Lord, I said, in order that people of the church may be conjoined with Him and affiliated with angels. This conjunction and affiliation are effected through the Word, in which each and every particular is a correspondent form.<p>The angels greatly rejoiced that it had pleased the Lord to reveal this great secret, which for several thousand years had lain so deeply hidden. And they said it was done in order that the Christian Church, founded as it is on the Word and being now at its end, might be revived and again draw its spirit through heaven from the Lord.<p>They inquired as well whether in consequence of that knowledge it had at this time been disclosed what baptism and Holy Supper symbolize, sacraments about which people have hitherto had such various thoughts. And I replied that it had been disclosed.</p><p>[3] I said further, 3. that the Lord has now revealed the circumstances of people's life after death.<p>The angels said, "What about life after death? Who does not know that a person lives after death?"<p>"They know it and do not know it," I replied. "They say that what lives after death is not the person but his soul, and that this lives on as a spirit, of which they harbor an idea as of its being like the wind or ether, saying that it does not live as a real person until after the day of the Last Judgment. At that time, they say, the elements of the body which were left in the world, even though eaten by worms, mice and fish, will be gathered together again and constituted once more into a body, and that it is thus that people will rise again."<p>"What is this you are saying?" the angels said. "Who does not know that a person lives as a person after death, the only difference being that he then lives as a spiritual person? And who does not know that a spiritual person sees a spiritual person as a material person does a material one, without their being aware of a single distinction, except that they are living in a more perfect state?"</p><p>[4] The angels then inquired, "What do people know of our world, and of heaven and hell?"<p>I said that they have known nothing, but 4. that the Lord has now disclosed the nature of the world in which angels and spirits live, thus the nature of heaven and the nature of hell; as also that angels and spirits live in affiliation with men; in addition to many other wonders connected with them.<p>The angels were gladdened that it had pleased the Lord to disclose such things, so that people would no longer suffer such ignorance as to be in a state of uncertainty regarding their immortality.</p><p>[5] Going on, I said, 5. "The Lord has now revealed that there is in your world a different sun from the one in our world; that the sun of your world is pure love, while the sun of our world is nothing but fire; that because your sun is pure love, everything that emanates from it brings with it something of life, while because our sun is nothing but fire, everything that emanates from it brings with it nothing of life; also that this is the origin of the difference between what is spiritual and what is natural, a difference hitherto unknown which has also been disclosed."<p>It has been made known in consequence of this, I said, from what source the light comes which enlightens the human intellect with wisdom, and from what source the warmth comes which kindles the human will with love.</p><p>[6] In addition, it has been disclosed 6. that there are three degrees of life, and consequently three heavens; that the human mind is divided into these degrees, and that the human being thus corresponds to the three heavens.<p>"Did people not know this before?" said the angels.<p>I replied that they knew about greater and lesser degrees in a range, but nothing about prior and subsequent degrees.</p><p>[7] The angels asked whether in addition to these disclosures anything else had been revealed. I said that a number of other things had been, namely, 7. concerning the Last Judgment; concerning the Lord, that He is God of heaven and earth, that God is one both in person and in essence, in whom is the Divine trinity, and that He is the Lord; also concerning the New Church about to be established by Him, and the doctrine of that church; concerning the sacredness of the Holy Scripture; as also that the Apocalypse has been revealed, nothing of which could have been revealed, not even in one little verse, except by the Lord.<p>Included also is a revelation concerning inhabitants of other planets and concerning other earths in the universe, I said; as well as many accounts and wonders from the spiritual world, by which much else having to do with wisdom has been disclosed from heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #532 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>532. I add to this a story.<p>In spirit I was once whisked up into the angelic heaven and into one of its communities, and then some of the wise people there came up to me and said, "What's new from the earth?"<p>"This is new," I told them. "The Lord has revealed unknown things that surpass the mysteries revealed from the beginning of the church until now!"<p>"What are they?" they asked.<p>I said that they are these:<p>(a) That in all the things in the Word, including its details, there is a spiritual meaning that corresponds to the earthly meaning, and that through this meaning a person in the church is joined to the Lord and is in companionship with angels, and that the holiness of the Word resides in this spiritual content.<p>(b) That the correspondences that the spiritual content of the Word consists of have been disclosed.<p>The angels asked, "Didn't the world's inhabitants know about the correspondences before this?"<p>"Not a thing," I said. "They've lain hidden for several thousand years now - certainly since the time of Job. And among the people who lived at that time and before it, knowledge of correspondences was the knowledge of knowledges. It gave them wisdom, because from it they had a grasp of things having to do with heaven and therefore with the church. But that knowledge turned into idolatry, so it was wiped out, thanks to the Lord's Divine Providence, and lost, so no one has seen a trace of it. And yet the Lord has now disclosed it to make a connection with Him for people in the church, and companionship with angels. This is done through the Word, where everything, including the details, are correspondences."<p>The angels were very much delighted that the Lord saw fit to reveal this great unknown fact, so deeply hidden through so many thousands of years, and they said, "This is for the purpose of reviving the Christian church, which is based on the Word and is now at its end, so it can be revived by the Lord through heaven."<p>They asked if this knowledge discloses today what baptism and the Holy Supper - which there have been so many different opinions about till now - stand for.<p>I answered that it is disclosed.<p>(c) I went on to say: "At this day the Lord has revealed the facts about life after death."<p>The angels said, "What about life after death? Who doesn't know that a person lives after death?"<p>"They know," I said, "and they don't know. They say it's not the person but his soul, and that it lives as a spirit, and they foster a notion of a spirit like a wind or atmosphere, and that the person does not live until after the Last Judgment Day. And they think that then the parts of the body they left behind in the world will be gathered again and put back together into a body, even though eaten by worms, mice, and fish, and that this is the way people are to be resurrected."<p>The angels said, "What is this? Who doesn't know that a person lives after death as a person, with the only difference that he lives as a spiritual person, and that a spiritual person sees a spiritual person just the way a material person sees a material person? And that they know not one difference, except that they are in a more perfect condition?"<p>(d) The angels asked, "What do they know about our world and about heaven and hell?"<p>I said, "They know nothing, but at this day the Lord has disclosed what the world where angels and spirits live is like that is, what heaven is like and what hell is like. Also that angels and spirits are associated with people. As well as many remarkable things about them."<p>The angels were glad that the Lord was pleased to disclose things like that to keep people from being in doubt about their immortality any longer due to ignorance.<p>(e) I told them further, "The Lord has revealed at this day that there is a different Sun in your world than in ours, and that your world's Sun is pure love and our world's sun is mere fire.<p>And that therefore everything that radiates from your Sun, because it is pure love, brings something of life, and everything that radiates from ours, because it is mere fire, brings nothing of life. And that this is where the difference between spiritual and natural comes from - a difference unknown till now, which has also been disclosed.<p>(f) This tells where the light that lights human intellect is from and where the heat that kindles the human will with love is from. And besides, it is disclosed that there are three levels of life, so there are three heavens, and the human mind is divided into three levels, and so a person corresponds to the three heavens."<p>The angels said, "Didn't they know this before?"<p>I answered that they know about levels between more and less but nothing about the levels between what comes before and after in order.<p>(g) The angels asked if more things than those have been revealed.<p>"Many," I said, "about the Last Judgment, about the Lord that He is God of heaven and earth, that God is one person and essence with the Divine Trinity in it, and that He is the Lord, also about the New Church established by Him, and about the teachings of that church, about the holiness of Sacred Scripture.<p>Also that the Book of Revelation has been explained, of which not one tiny verse could have been revealed except by the Lord.<p>Moreover, about the inhabitants of the planets and the earths in the universe. Also many noteworthy and amazing things from the spiritual world. By all this many things that have to do with wisdom have been disclosed from heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #532 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>532. To the above I will add the following Memorable Relation: As to my spirit I was once taken up into the angelic heaven and into one of its societies. Some of the wise men there then came to me and asked, "What news from earth?" I told them: "This is new: The Lord has revealed arcana which surpass in excellence the arcana hitherto revealed from the beginning of the Church." To their question, "What are these arcana?" I answered, "They are these:<p>"1. That in the Word, in each and every part thereof, there is a spiritual sense corresponding to the natural sense; that by this sense, the men of the Church have conjunction with the Lord and consociation with angels; and that in it resides the holiness of the Word.<p>"2. The correspondences of which the spiritual sense of the Word consists have been disclosed."<p>The angels asked, "Did not the inhabitants of the globe know about correspondences before?" I said: "Nothing whatever. They have lain hidden now for some thousands of years, ever since the time of Job. With those who lived at that time and previous thereto, the science of correspondences was the science of sciences from which they had their wisdom, because from it they had knowledge concerning things spiritual, being the things of heaven and hence of the church. But when this science was turned into an idolatrous science, then, of the Lord's Divine Providence it was so obliterated and destroyed that no one saw any sign of it. Still, it has now been disclosed by the Lord in order that men of the church may have conjunction with Him and consociation with angels. This is effected by means of the Word in which each and every thing is a correspondence." Greatly rejoicing that it had pleased the Lord to reveal this great arcanum, so deeply hidden for some thousands of years, the angels said, "This has been done to the end that the Christian Church, which is founded upon the Word and is now at its end, may again revive and draw breath through heaven from the Lord." They then asked whether by means of that science it had been now disclosed what is signified by Baptism and the Holy Supper, about which men have hitherto thought so variously. I answered that this is now disclosed.<p>3. I said further, "A revelation has at this day been made by the Lord respecting the life of men after death." Whereupon the angels said, "Why about life after death? Who does not know that man lives after death?" I replied: "Men know of it and do not know. They say that what lives after death is not the man but his soul; that this lives as a spirit, and of the spirit they cherish an idea as of wind or ether; that men do not live as men until after the day of the last judgment; that their corporeal parts which they had left behind in the world, though eaten up by worms, mice, and fishes, will then be gathered up and again be fitted into a body, and that in this way men will rise again." the angels said: "What is this? Who does not know that after death man lives as a man, with the sole difference that he then lives as a spiritual man? and a spiritual man sees a spiritual man just as a material man a material, nor do they know a single distinction except that they are in a more perfect state?"<p>4. The angels then asked, "What do they know about our world? and about heaven and hell?" I said: "They have not known anything; but at this day the nature of the spiritual world in which angels and spirits live has been disclosed by the Lord, and thus the nature of heaven and the nature of hell; also that angels and spirits are in conjunction with men, besides many wonderful things about them." The angels were glad that it had pleased the Lord to disclose such things so that man from ignorance may no longer be in uncertainty respecting his immortality.<p>5. I said further: "At this day it has been revealed by the Lord that in your world there is a sun other than the sun in ours, and that the sun of your world is pure love, and the sun of our world pure fire; that therefore all that proceeds from your sun, this being pure love, partakes of life, and all that proceeds from ours, this being pure fire, takes nothing from life; and that thence is the difference between the spiritual and the natural. This difference, hitherto unknown, has also been disclosed, and thereby, it has been made known whence is the light which enlightens the human understanding with wisdom, and whence the heat which enkindles the human will with love.<p>6. "Moreover, it has been disclosed that there are three degrees of life, and hence three heavens; that the human mind is distinguished into these degrees, and that man thus corresponds to the three heavens." The angels said, "Did not men know this before?" I answered that they knew of the degrees between greater and less, but nothing of the degrees between the prior and the posterior.<p>7. The angels then asked whether any other new things had been revealed, and I said: "Many, being things concerning the Last Judgment; concerning the Lord, that He is the God of heaven and earth; that God is one, both in person and in essence, in whom is a Divine Trinity, and that He is the Lord; also concerning the New Church to be established by Him, and concerning the doctrine of that Church; concerning the holiness of the Sacred Scripture. Moreover, the Apocalypse has been revealed, and this could not have been revealed, even as to the smallest verse, save by the Lord. Furthermore, revelation has been made concerning the inhabitants of the Planets and concerning the Earths in the Universe; besides many memorable and wonderful things from the spiritual world, whereby much that pertains to wisdom has been disclosed from heaven." </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #532 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>532. I append some Memorabilia: <sup >1</sup><p>I was once conveyed in spirit into an angelic heaven, and into one of its societies, whereupon some of the wise there approached me and asked, "What news is there from the earth?"<p>I said to them, "There is this news! The Lord has revealed arcana which for excellence surpass the arcana revealed from the beginning of the Church until now."<p>They asked, "What are they?"<p>I replied, "They are these.

That knowledge was made idolatrous, however, and therefore in the Lord's Divine Providence was blotted out and destroyed until no trace of it was left.

They also say that man does not live until after the last judgment-day, and that then the body's parts, left behind in the world, though eaten by worms, mice, and fish, will be reassembled and joined into a body, and that thus men will rise again."<p>"What!" said the angels. "Who does not know that man lives as a human being after death, with the sole difference that he lives then as a spiritual man?

The Apocalypse, too, has been revealed, which could not have been revealed, not even as to one small verse, except by the Lord.

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #532 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>532. Hereto I will add this Relation: I was once, as to my spirit, taken up into the angelic heaven, and into one of its societies, and then some of the wise there came to me and said, 'What is there new from earth?' I said to them, 'This is new: That the Lord has revealed secrets that surpass in excellence the secrets revealed hitherto from the beginning of the church.'<p>They asked, 'What are they?' I replied, 'They are these:<p>(1) That in the Word, in all and in the single things of it, there is a Spiritual Sense corresponding to the natural sense; and that through that sense there is conjunction of the men of the church with the Lord, and consociation with the angels; and that therein resides the holiness of the Word.<p>(2) That the Correspondences of which the spiritual sense of the Word consists have been disclosed.'<p>The angels asked, 'Have not the inhabitants of the globe known about correspondences before?' I replied, 'Nothing at all. And they have lain hidden now for some thousands of years, ever since the time of Job; yet with those who lived at that time, and before, the knowledge of correspondences was the knowledge of knowledges, from which they had wisdom, because cognition concerning things spiritual, which are those of heaven and thence of the church. But because that knowledge was converted to idolatrous purposes, it was, of the Lord's Divine Providence, so blotted out of remembrance and lost that no one saw any sign of it. But now, at last, it has been laid open by the Lord, in order that there may be brought to pass conjunction of the men of the church with Him, and consociation with the angels, and this is effected through the Word, wherein all and the single things are correspondences.'<p>The angels were greatly rejoiced that it had pleased the Lord to reveal this great secret, which for several thousands of years had lain so deeply concealed, and said, 'It is to the end that the Christian church, which is founded upon the Word, and is now at its end, may revive again and draw breath through heaven from the Lord.' And they asked whether through this knowledge it has at this day been made known what is signified by baptism and the holy supper, about which hitherto men have thought so variously? I answered that it has been made known.<p>(3) I said further that a revelation has at this day been made by the Lord respecting the life of men after death.<p>The angels said, 'What about life after death? Who does not know that man lives after death?' I replied, 'They know and they do not know. They say it is not the man but his soul that lives, and that this lives as a spirit and of the spirit they cherish the idea that it is as wind or ether, and that the man does not live until after the day of the last judgment; and that then the bodies that men had left behind in the world, though eaten by worms, mice, and fishes, will be gathered up and brought together again into a body, and that thus men will rise again.'<p>The angels said, 'What is this? Who does not know that man lives as a man after death, with the difference only that then he lives as a spiritual man, and that the spiritual man sees the spiritual man as the material man sees the material. And that they know not a single difference except that they are in a more perfect state?'<p>(4) The angels asked, 'What do they know about our world? And about heaven and hell?' I said, 'They know nothing. But at this day the Lord has disclosed the nature of the spiritual world in which angels and spirits live, and thus what the nature of heaven is, and of what quality hell is, as also that angels and spirits are in conjunction with men, and many wonderful things about them.'<p>The angels were glad that the Lord had been pleased to make such things known, so that men may no longer grope in uncertainty from ignorance respecting his immortality.<p>(5) I told them further: 'At this day the Lord has revealed that in your world there is an other sun from that in ours, and that the sun of your world is pure love, and the sun of our world is pure fire. And that therefore, all that proceeds from your sun, because it is pure love, partakes of life; and that all that proceeds from our sun, because it is pure fire, partakes nothing of life, and that thence is the difference between the spiritual and the natural; which difference, hitherto unknown, has also been disclosed. From which it has become known whence the light is that enlightens the human understanding with wisdom, and whence is the heat which enkindles the human will with love.<p>(6) It has besides been made known that there are three degrees of life; and that thence there are three heavens; and that the human mind is distinguished into three degrees, and thence man corresponds to the three heavens.'<p>The angels said, 'Did they not know this before?' I answered that, 'They knew of degrees between greater and less, but nothing of the degrees between prior and posterior.'<p>(7) The angels asked whether any more things than these have been revealed? I said, 'Many more. Namely: Respecting the Last Judgment: Respecting the Lord, that He is the God of heaven and earth: That God is one, both in Person and in Essence, in whom is a Divine Trinity, and that He is the Lord: And respecting the New Church to be established by Him; and concerning the Doctrine of that church: Respecting the Holiness of the Sacred Scripture: Also that the Apocalypse has been revealed, which could not have been revealed, even as to one little verse, except by the Lord: Moreover, respecting the Inhabitants of the planets, and of the Earths in the Universe: besides many notable and wonderful things out of the spiritual world, whereby many things that pertain to wisdom have been revealed from heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #532 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>532. His adjiciam hoc Memorabile. Quondam quoad spiritum meum evectus sum in Coelum Angelicum, et in unam ejus Societatem; et tunc accesserunt ad me aliqui ex sapientibus ibi, et dixerunt, "quid Novum e terra;" dixi illis, "hoc Novum est, quod Dominus revelaverit Arcana, quae excellentia excedunt Arcana ab initio Ecclesiae huc usque revelata;" quaesiverunt, "quae sunt illa;" dixi quod haec sint.<p>I. Quod in Verbo in omnibus et singulis ejus sit Sensus spiritualis correspondens Sensui naturali, et quod per illum Sensum sit conjunctio hominum Ecclesiae cum Domino, et consociatio cum Angelis, et quod sanctitas Verbi in eo resideat.</p><p>[2] II. Quod Correspondentiae, ex quibus Sensus spiritualis Verbi consistit, detectae sint; quaesiverunt Angeli, anne habitatores Orbis de Correspondentiis prius sciverunt; dixi, quod prorsus nihil; et quod latuerint nunc per aliquot millia annorum, nempe usque a Hiobi tempore; et quod apud illos qui eo tempore et ante illud vixerunt, Scientia correspondentiarum fuerit Scientia scientiarum, ex qua illis sapientia, quia cognitio de spiritualibus quae Coeli et inde Ecclesiae sunt; sed quod Scientia illa, quia versa est in idololatricam, <sup>1</sup>ex Divina Domini Providentia ita obliterata et deperdita sit, ut nemo viderit aliquod signum de illa: sed quod usque nunc a Domino detecta sit, ut fiat conjunctio hominum Ecclesiae cum Ipso, et consociatio cum Angelis; et haec fit per Verbum, in quo omnia et singula Correspondentiae sunt. Angeli valde gavisi sunt, quod placuerit Domino revelare hoc magnum Arcanum per aliquot millia annorum tam alte reconditum; et dixerunt, quod hoc sit propter finem, ut Ecclesia Christiana, quae fundatur super Verbo, et nunc in suo fine est, iterum revivat et trahat spiritum per Coelum a Domino. Quaesiverunt num per illam Scientiam hodie detectum sit, quid Baptismus et quid Sacra Coena significant, de quibus tam varia huc usque cogitaverunt, et respondi, quod detectum sit.</p><p>[3] III. Porro dixi, quod hodie a Domino revelatum sit de Vita hominum post mortem; dixerunt Angeli, "quid de vita post mortem; quis non scit, quod homo vivat post mortem;" respondi, "sciunt et non sciunt; dicunt, quod non homo, sed anima ejus, et quod haec vivat spiritus, et de spiritu fovent ideam sicut de vento aut aethere, et quod non vivat homo, quam post diem ultimi Judicii, et quod tunc corporea, quae reliquerant in Mundo, tametsi a vermibus, muribus et piscibus exesa, recolligerentur et rursus coaptarentur in corpus, et quod homines sic resurrecturi sint;" dixerunt Angeli, "quid hoc; quis non scit quod homo vivat homo post mortem, cum sola differentia quod tunc vivat homo spiritualis, et quod homo spiritualis videat hominem spiritualem, sicut homo materialis materialem, et quod non sciant unum discrimen, praeter quod in statu perfectiori sint."</p><p>[4] IV. Quaesiverunt Angeli, "quid sciunt de nostro Mundo, ac de Coelo et Inferno;" dixi, <sup>2</sup>quod nihil sciverint, at quod hodie a Domino detectum sit, qualis est Mundus in quo Angeli et Spiritus vivunt, ita quale est Coelum et quale est Infernum; tum etiam quod Angeli et Spiritus sint in conjunctione cum hominibus; praeter multa Mirabilia de illis: Angeli laetati sunt, quod Domino placuerit talia detegere, ne homo amplius ex ignorantia in ambiguitate sit de sua Immortalitate.</p><p>[5] V. Amplius dixi, quod hodie a Domino revelatum sit, quod in Vestro Mundo sit alius Sol, quam in nostro, et quod Sol vestri Mundi sit purus Amor, et quod Sol nostri Mundi sit purus ignis; et quod ideo omne quod procedit ex vestro Sole, quia est purus Amor, trahat ex vita, et quod omne quod a nostro, quia est purus ignis, nihil ex vita trahat; et quod inde sit differentia inter Spirituale et Naturale, quae differentia hactenus ignota etiam detecta est. Ex quo notum factum est, unde est Lux quae illuminat sapientia intellectum humanum, et unde est Calor, qui accendit amore voluntatem humanam.</p><p>[6] VI. Insuper quod detectum sit, quod sint tres gradus vitae, et quod inde sint tres Coeli; et quod in illos gradus distincta sit Mens humana, et quod inde homo correspondeat tribus Coelis; dixerunt Angeli, "annon sciverunt hoc prius;" respondi, quod sciverint de gradibus inter magis et minus, sed nihil de gradibus inter prius et posterius.</p><p>[7]5 VII. Interrogaverunt Angeli, num praeter illa revelata sint plura; dixi quod plura; quae sunt de Ultimo Judicio; de Domino, quod sit Deus coeli et terrae, quod Deus sit unus et persona et essentia, in quo Divina Trinitas, et quod Ille sit Dominus; tum de Nova Ecclesia ab Ipso instauranda, et de Doctrina illius Ecclesiae; De Sanctitate Scripturae sacrae; quod etiam Apocalypsis revelata sit, quae ne quidem quoad unum versiculum revelari potuit nisi a Domino. Insuper de Incolis Planetarum, ac de Telluribus in Universo: praeter multa Memorabilia et Mirabilia e Mundo Spirituali, per quae plura, quae sapientiae sunt, e Coelo detecta sunt. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Prima editio: idolatricam,<br><br>2.&nbsp;Prima editio: dixi; </p>
