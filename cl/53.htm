<h4 align="center"></h4><p>53、⑻这是上天堂者的情形，但下地狱者的情形则不同。我们说，死后，男人会被赐予一个合适的妻子，女人会被赐予一个合适的丈夫，他们享有快乐、幸福的亲密关系，且只有属灵的生育，其实说的是那些被接到天上、成为天使者。因为这些人是属灵的，他们的婚姻也是属灵的，因而是神圣的。相反，凡下地狱者全都是属世的，纯属世的婚姻并非婚姻，只不过是源于淫欲的苟合。有关这类苟合的性质，等到论述贞洁与非贞洁，以及淫乱之爱时再予以说明。</p>
<h4 align="center">《婚姻之爱》</h4><p>53、（8）进入天堂的人是这种情况。进入地狱的人的情况是不同的</p><p>我们说死后男人有一个适合的妻子，女人会有一个适合的丈夫，他们会有一个更美好的关系。但是除了灵性上的创造外不会有孩子。这种情况是进入天堂中的人的情形。这是因为这些人是有灵性的，他们的婚姻也是有灵性的，进而是圣洁的。</p><p>相反，进入地狱中的人是自然人，自然的婚姻不是真正的婚姻而是来自于色欲。这种情况我们以后再讲。</p>

<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #53 (Chadwick (1996))</h4><p>53. (viii) This is what happens to those who go to heaven, but not to those who go to hell.<p>When it is said that after death a man is given a suitable wife and a woman likewise a suitable husband, and that they enjoy the pleasures and blessedness of living together, but without procreating any but spiritual offspring, it must be understood that this refers to those who are received into heaven and become angels. This is because these people are spiritual, and marriages are essentially spiritual and thus holy. Those, however, who go to hell are all natural, and marriages that are only natural are not marriages, but unions tainted with unchaste lust. The nature of these unions will be described later on, when I discuss chastity and unchastity, and further when I speak of scortatory love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #53 (Rogers (1995))</h4><p>53. 8. This is what happens in the case of people who come into heaven. It is different, however, with those who go to hell. When we say that after death a man is given a suitable wife, and a woman, likewise, a suitable husband, and that they enjoy delightful and blessed relations, but without any procreation other than a spiritual procreation, it should be understood that we are referring to people who are received into heaven and become angels. That is because these people are spiritual, and marriages are in themselves spiritual, and therefore sacred.<p>In contrast, however, those people who go to hell are all natural people, and merely natural marriages are not marriages, but pairings that result from unchaste lust. What these pairings are like will be told later, in the chapter on chastity and its absence, <sup >1</sup>and further in the chapters on licentious love. <sup >2</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See nos. 138ff.<br><br>2.&nbsp;See nos. 423ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Love in Marriage #53 (Gladish (1992))</h4><p>53. 8. This happens to those who enter heaven. It is different for those who go to hell. Those who are received into heaven and become angels are spiritual, and marriages are spiritual in their own right and therefore holy, so after death a man gets a suitable wife and similarly a wife a suitable husband, and they enjoy happy and rich intercourse, though without having children. This applies to those who go to heaven.<p>However, those who enter hell are all worldly, and merely worldly marriages are not marriages but liaisons derived from unchaste desire. Later, where the subject is chastity and unchastity, and further when love of fornication is discussed, I tell what these liaisons are like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #53 (Acton (1953))</h4><p>53. VIII. THAT THIS IS THE CASE WITH THOSE WHO GO TO HEAVEN; NOT SO WITH THOSE WHO GO TO HELL. The statements, that after death a suitable wife is given to the man, and likewise a suitable husband to the wife, and that they enjoy delightful and blessed intercourse but without other than spiritual prolification, are to be understood of those who are received into heaven and become angels. The reason is because they are spiritual, and marriages in themselves are spiritual and thence holy. But all who go to hell are natural, and merely natural marriages are not marriages but conjunctions which originate in unchaste lust. What the nature of these conjunctions is, will be shown hereafter when treating of the chaste and the unchaste, and further when treating of scortatory love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #53 (Wunsch (1937))</h4><p>53. (viii) This is what befalls those who come into heaven, but it is otherwise with those who go into hell. What we have been saying - that after death a man is given a suitable wife, and the wife a suitable husband, and that partners enjoy pleasant and blessed intercourse, but without any prolification other than a spiritual one - all this is to be understood of those who are received into heaven and become angels. For these are spiritual, and marriages themselves are spiritual and therefore holy. But all who go into hell are natural, and marriages merely natural are not marriages, but connections springing from unchaste desire. We shall speak of the character of the latter conjunctions in what follows, where we consider what is chaste and unchaste, and again when we discuss scortatory love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Conjugial Love #53 (Warren and Tafel (1910))</h4><p>53. (8) That it is thus with those that come into heaven; but with those that go into hell it is otherwise. That a suitable wife is given to a man after death, and likewise to the wife a suitable husband, and that they enjoy delightful and blessed intercourse, but without other than spiritual prolification, is to be understood of those that are received into heaven and become angels - for the reason that they are spiritual, and marriages in themselves are spiritual and therefore, holy. But on the contrary those that go to hell are all natural, and merely natural marriages are not marriages, but conjunctions which originate in unchaste lust. What the nature of these conjunctions is will be shown hereafter, where the chaste and the unchaste, and further where scortatory love is treated of. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Amore Conjugiali #53 (original Latin (1768))</h4><p>53. VIII: Quod ita fiat illis qui veniunt in Coelum, aliter vero illis qui in Infernum. Quod post mortem detur viro uxor conveniens, et uxori maritus similiter, et quod hi fruantur consortiis jucundis et beatis, verum absque prolificatione alia quam spirituali, intelligendum est de illis qui recipiuntur in Coelum et fiunt Angeli; causa est, quia hi spirituales sunt, et conjugia in se sunt spiritualia, et inde sancta: at vero illi qui in Infernum veniunt, sunt omnes naturales, et conjugia mere naturalia non sunt conjugia, sed conjunctiones, quae trahunt ex libidine incasta: quales hae conjunctiones sunt, in sequentibus, ubi agitur de Casto et Incasto, et porro ubi de Amore scortatorio, dicetur. </p>
