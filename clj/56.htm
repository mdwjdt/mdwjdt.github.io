<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第56节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">七、灵界中的天主教徒</h4><p>56、我在《最后的审判》一书（53-64节）论述了天主教徒和对他们的最后审判。在灵界，天主教徒出现在新教徒的周围区域，通过一个间隔地带与他们分开，他们不可以越过这个地带。尽管如此，一些耶稣会会士仍利用狡诈手段开辟了与新教徒的交流渠道，还通过不为人知的路径派出密使，目的是引诱新教徒远离新教。但他们被发现了，受到惩罚后要么被送回他们的同伴当中，要么被投入地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 56</h4><p>56. Roman Catholics in the Spiritual World<p>In <a href="../lj/53.htm">53</a>–<a href="../lj/64.htm">64</a> of the booklet Last Judgment I wrote about the Roman Catholics and the Last Judgment on them. In the spiritual world Catholics surround the area where the Protestants are, but they are separated from them by an intervening space that they are not allowed to cross. Some from the Order of the Jesuits, though, use devious means to set up channels of communication with Protestants. They also send their agents along uncharted paths with the intent of luring Protestants away from Protestantism. These agents are found out, however, and after they have been punished they are either sent back to their people or cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 56</h4><p>56. VII. THE ROMAN CATHOLICS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD <p>I dealt with the Roman Catholics and the Last Judgment on them in my book ON THE LAST JUDGMENT (<a href="53.htm">53-64</a>). The Roman Catholics in the spiritual world are to be seen surrounding the Reformed and separated by a gap which they are not allowed to cross. Nonetheless members of the Jesuit order employ underhand tricks to communicate, and also despatch emissaries by little known routes to seduce people. But they are hunted down, and after being punished are either sent back to their companions or cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 56</h4><p>56. VII. THE PAPISTS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>The Papists, and the Last Judgment upon them, were treated of in the small work on <a href="../lj/53.htm">The Last Judgment 53-64</a>. The Papists in the spiritual world appear around the Reformed, and are separated from them by an interval, which they are not permitted to pass. Nevertheless, those who are of the order of Jesuits, by clandestine arts procure for themselves communications, and also send out emissaries, by unknown paths, for the purpose of seducing them. But they are discovered, and after being punished, they are either sent back to their companions, or are cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 56 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>56. (VII.) DE PONTIFICIIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI. <p>Actum est de Pontificiis, et de ultimo judicio super illos, in opusculo De Ultimo Judicio (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_56/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_53" target=_top>53-64</a>). Pontificii in mundo spirituali apparent circum Reformatos, ac per intervallum distincti sunt, quod non permittitur transire: sed usque illi, qui ex Jesuitico ordine sunt, per clandestinas artes parant sibi communicationes, et quoque per semitas ignotas ablegant emissarios, ut seducant; sed indagantur, et postquam puniti sunt, vel remittuntur ad socios, vel conjiciuntur in infernum. </p>
