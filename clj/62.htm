<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第62节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>62、拥有这爱的，是那些在沉迷于其中的快乐诱惑下操控他人，藐视圣言，喜欢教皇的谕令胜过圣言的天主教徒。他们于外在方面会经历彻底的毁坏，直到对教会一无所知；然后，他们被投入地狱，成为魔鬼。有一个单独的地狱专门留给那些想作为神被召唤的人。住在那里的人深深陷入幻想，以致他们看不见存在的东西，只看见不存在的东西。这种幻想就像高烧病人的精神错乱，他们会看见漂浮在空气中、房间里和床单上的小东西，其实这种东西根本就不存在。这种最糟糕的邪恶由蛇的头来表示，它被女人的种所踹，并伤了祂的脚跟（创世记3:15）。主的脚跟，也就是女人的种，是指所发出的最外在形式上的神性，也就是圣言的字义。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 62</h4><p>62. This love is characteristic of those Catholics who exerted control over others because of the irresistible itch of the pleasure involved, and who had no use for the Word and preferred the decrees of the pope. First they are deprived of all their outer knowledge so completely that they no longer know anything about the church; then they are cast into hell and become devils.<p>There is a particular separate hell for the ones who want to be called upon as gods. The people who live there are so deep in fantasy that they see not what is, but what is not. It is like the delirium of people with a severe fever who see little things in the air, in the room, and on their bedspread that are not there at all.<p>This worst of all evils is meant by the head of the serpent that was trampled by the seed of the woman, and that wounded his heel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>). The heel of the Lord (who is the seed of the woman) is the emanating divine influence at the outermost level, which is the Word in its literal meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 62</h4><p>62. This is the love of those of the Roman Catholics who, enticed by the pleasure of indulging it, have exercised control over others and who have poured scorn on the Word, preferring to it the Pope's dictates. These undergo total devastation as regards externals, until they no longer know anything about the church; then they are cast down into hell and become devils. There is a separate hell reserved for those who want to be invoked as gods, where their imagination is so disordered that they see what does not exist, not what does. Their delirium is like that of some patients suffering from malign fever who see non-existent specks in the air and in their room and on their bedclothes. This is the worst of evils meant by the serpent's head, which is trodden on by the seed of the woman, and which injures his heel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>). The heel of the Lord, who is the seed of the woman, is the Divine proceeding in its ultimate form, which is the literal sense of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 62</h4><p>62. Those of the Papal nation have this love who have had dominion from the frenzy of its delight, and have despised the Word, and preferred the dictates of the Pope to it. They are utterly devastated as to externals, until they no longer know anything of the church, and then they are cast down into hell and become devils. There is a certain separate hell for those who wish to be invoked as gods, where such is their fantasy, that they do not see what is, but what is not. Their delirium is such as affects persons in a malignant fever, who see things floating in the air and in the chamber, and on the covering of the bed, which do not exist. This worst of evils is meant by: <p>The head of the serpent, which is bruised by the Seed of the woman, and which wounds His heel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>). <p>"The heel" of the Lord, who is "the Seed of the woman," is the Divine proceeding in ultimates, which is the Word in the sense of the letter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 62 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>62. Hic amor est illis ex gente Pontificia qui ex oestro jucundi amoris ejus dominati sunt, et Verbum contempserunt, ac illi praetulerunt dictamina Papae: hi devastantur prorsus quoad externa, usque ut nihil ecclesiae amplius sciant; et tunc dejiciuntur in infernum, et fiunt diaboli. Est quoddam infernum separatum pro illis qui invocari volunt ut dii, ubi in tali phantasia sunt, ut non videant quod est, sed quod non est; est delirium illis quale est quibusdam in febri maligna, qui vident floccos in aere, et in camera ac super integumento lecti sui, quae non sunt. Hoc malum pessimum intelligitur per <p>Caput serpentis, quod conculcatur a Semine mulieris, et quod laedit calcaneum ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_15" target=_top>Genesis 3:15</a>); <p>"calcaneus" Domini, qui est "Semen mulieris," est Divinum procedens in ultimis, quod est Verbum in sensu litterae. </p>
