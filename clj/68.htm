<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第68节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">九、灵界中的伊斯兰教徒和穆罕默德</h4><p>68、在灵界，伊斯兰教徒出现在西部天主教徒的后面，可以说围绕着他们。他们之所以出现在那里，主要原因是，他们承认主是最伟大的先知，神的儿子，最有智慧的，祂被差到世上来教导人类。在灵界，每个人所生活的地方，相对于新教徒所占据的基督徒中心地带的距离，都取决于这个人对主和一位神的承认。正是这种承认将人们的心智与天堂联结起来，并决定了他们与主在其上的东方的距离。那些由于邪恶的生活而内心缺乏这种承认的人则在这些社群之下的地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 68</h4><p>68. Muslims and Muhammad in the Spiritual World<p>In the spiritual world, Muslims appear beyond the Catholics in the west; they form a kind of perimeter around them. The main reason they appear there is that they recognize the Lord as the greatest prophet, the Son of God, and the wisest of all, who was sent into the world to teach us.<p>In the spiritual world, the place where each person lives in relation to the central Christian region, inhabited by Protestants, is determined by that person’s acknowledgment of the Lord and of the oneness of God. This is because such acknowledgment joins people’s minds to heaven and determines their distance from the east, above which is the Lord. People who lack that acknowledgment in their hearts because they have lived an evil life are in the hells underneath these communities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 68</h4><p>68. IX. THE MOHAMMEDANS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD, AND ON MOHAMMED <p>The Mohammedans in the spiritual world are to be seen behind the Roman Catholics in the west, and as it were surrounding them. The chief reason why they are to be seen in that position is that they acknowledge the Lord as a very great prophet, the Son of God, and the wisest of all, who was sent into the world to teach mankind. In that world the distance at which each person lives from the Christian heartland occupied by the Reformed depends upon his admission of belief in the Lord and in one God. For that is what links their minds with heaven, and determines their distance from the east, above which the Lord is. Those who due to their wicked lives do not share that belief are in the hells below them. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 68</h4><p>68. IX. THE MOHAMMEDANS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD; AND MOHAMMED. <p>The Mohammedans in the spiritual world appear behind the Papists in the west, and form as it were a circle around them. The principal reason why they appear there is, because they acknowledge the Lord as the Greatest Prophet, the Son of God, the Wisest of all, who was sent into the world to teach men. Every one in that world dwells at a distance from the Christian center where the Reformed are, according to his confession of the Lord and of one God; for that confession conjoins minds with heaven, and determines distance from the east, above which the Lord is. They who, from the life of evil, are not in that confession in heart, are in the hells beneath them. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 68 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>68. (IX.) DE MAHUMEDANIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI; ET DE MAHUMEDE. <p>Mahumedani in Mundo spirituali apparent post Pontificios in occidente, et faciunt quasi ambitum: quod ibi appareant, est praecipue quia Dominum agnoscunt pro Maximo Propheta, Filio Deo, Sapientissimo omnium, qui missus in mundum ut doceret homines. Quisque in illo mundo habitat ad distantiam a meditullio Christiano, ubi sunt Reformati, secundum confessionem Domini ac unius Dei; nam illa conjungit animos caelo, et facit distantiam ab oriente, super quo est Dominus; illi qui non in illa confessione sunt corde ex vita mala, sub illis in infernis sunt. </p>
