<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第86节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十三、灵界中的摩拉维亚教徒</h4><p>86、我与摩拉维亚教徒（他们也被称为海伦胡特兄弟会）有过多次交谈。起初，他们出现在离犹太人不远的一个山谷中；经过检查和揭露之后，他们被带到一个无人居住区。对他们的检查显示，他们知道如何狡猾地迷惑人们的心智，声称他们是使徒教会的余民。这就是为何他们会互称“弟兄”，并尊称那些保守他们更深私密的妇人为“母亲”。他们还说，他们比其他人更强调信仰，爱主，因为祂在十字架上受难，并称主为羔羊和恩典的宝座，以及其它类似说法。他们利用这些说法来说服人们相信，他们才是真正的基督教会。那些被他们的花言巧语迷惑并接近他们的人，会受到他们的检查，以查看这些人是不是那种他们敢于向其透露他们秘密的人。如果他们不是，摩拉维亚教徒就会隐藏这些秘密；若有可能，他们就会透露它们；然后警告并威胁凡泄露他们关于主的秘密之人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 86</h4><p>86. Moravians in the Spiritual World<p>I have had many conversations with Moravians (also known as Herrnhuters). At first they were to be found in a valley not far from the Jews. After they had undergone examination and had been revealed for what they were, they were taken off to some uninhabited areas.<p>The examination of them revealed that they were very knowledgeable and skillful in how to captivate people’s minds, presenting themselves as a remnant of the apostolic church. For this reason they would call each other “brother” and use the term “mother” of women who were open to learning their deeper mysteries. They also said that they more than others stress faith and that they love the Lord because he suffered on the cross, calling him the Lamb and the Throne of Grace, and more in the same vein, in order to foster a belief that they are the true Christian church. People who are taken in by their smooth words are then examined by the Moravians to see whether they are the kind to whom they would dare disclose their mysteries. If those who are examined are not the right kind, the Moravians keep their mysteries to themselves; but if they find they can disclose their mysteries to them, they do so. They then give them warnings and even utter threats against any of them who would divulge their secret teachings about the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 86</h4><p>86. XIII. THE MORAVIANS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD <p>I had many conversations with the Moravians, also known as the Herrnhuters. They were at first to be seen in a valley not far from the Jews; after being examined and shown up they were taken to an uninhabited region. While under examination they knew how to ensnare minds with their cunning, saying that they were the remains of the Apostolic church, and that is why they greet one another as brothers, and as mothers those women who keep their more intimate secrets. They also claim that they excel others in the teaching of faith, and that they love the Lord because He suffered the cross, calling Him the Lamb and the Throne of Grace. They have many other similar claims to persuade people to believe that theirs is the true Christian church. Those who approach ensnared by their smooth talking are examined to see whether they are the kind of people to whom they would dare to entrust their secrets. If they are not, they conceal them, but if possible, they reveal them. Then they issue warnings and threaten any who publish their secrets about the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 86</h4><p>86. XIII. THE MORAVIANS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>I have conversed much with the Moravians, who are also called Herrnhuters. They appeared, at first, in a valley not far from the Jews; but after being examined and detected, were conveyed away into uninhabited places. When they were being examined, they knew how with cunning to captivate minds, saying, that they were the remains of the Apostolic Church, and that therefore they salute each other as brethren, and those who receive their interior mysteries as mothers; also that they teach faith better than others and love the Lord because He suffered the cross, calling Him the Lamb, and the Throne of grace; with other like expressions, by which they induce the belief that the Christian church itself is with them. Those who are captivated by their smooth speeches and draw near to them, are examined by them to see whether they are such that they dare disclose to them their mysteries; if not they conceal them; if they can they reveal them; and then they warn and also threaten those who divulge their mystery concerning the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 86 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>86. (XIII.) DE MORAVIANIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI. <p>Cum Moravianis, qui etiam Herrenhuteri vocantur, multa locutus sum. Apparuerunt primum in valle non procul a Judaeis; et postquam explorati et detecti sunt, in loca inhabitata delati sunt. Dum explorabantur, sciverunt callide captare animos, dicentes quod reliquiae Apostolicae Ecclesiae essent, et quod ideo salutent se fratres, ac matres illas quae interiora illorum arcana recipiunt; tum quod prae ceteris doceant fidem, et quod ament Dominum quia passus est crucem, vocando illum Agnum, et Solium gratiae; praeter similia alia, per quae inducunt fidem quod ipsa Ecclesia Christiana apud illos sit. Illi qui a blandiloquiis illorum captati accedunt, explorantur ab illis num tales sint ut illis arcana sua detegere ausint; si non, celant illa, et si possint, revelant; et tunc monent, et quoque minantur illis, qui arcanum illorum de Domino evulgant. </p>
