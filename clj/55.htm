<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第55节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>55、我将在别处讲述路德的命运，因为我多次听见并看见过他。在此我只说明，他常常试图摆脱他的唯信教义，但没有成功。因此，他仍在天堂与地狱中间的灵人界，在那里有时艰难度日。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 55</h4><p>55. Elsewhere I will discuss what happened to Luther; I have seen and heard him a number of times. Here I will say only that he has often tried to let go of his belief about faith alone, but without success, and that therefore he is still in the world of spirits, which is halfway between heaven and hell, and sometimes life is hard for him there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 55</h4><p>55. I shall relate elsewhere what is Luther's <sup><a data-toggle>1</sup>fate, because I have heard and seen him many times. I shall only say that he has often wished to withdraw from his doctrine of faith alone, but found it impossible. He is therefore still in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell; he sometimes suffers severely there. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Luther (1483-1546) the famous German Reformer. More about his fate will be found in The True Christian Religion 796. </p><p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 55</h4><p>55. What Luther's lot is, shall be told elsewhere, for I have often heard and seen him. Here, I shall only say, that he has often wished to recede from his faith alone, but in vain; and that therefore, he is still in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell; where he sometimes suffers hard things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 55 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>55. Qualis sors Luthero est, alibi dicetur, quia multoties illum audivi et vidi: solum hoc, quod saepius voluerit recedere a sua sola fide, sed incassum; et quod ideo adhuc sit in mundo spirituum, qui est medius inter caelum et infernum; et quod quandoque ibi dura patiatur. </p>
