<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第66节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>66、天堂里的所谓圣徒则截然不同。他们对地上发生的事一无所知；我没能与他们交谈，唯恐有这方面的任何观念进入他们的脑海。只有一次，我看见主的母亲马利亚经过；她出现在头顶上，身穿白衣。然后，她暂停片刻，说她曾是主的母亲，主的确从她而生，但祂成了神，脱去了从她所得的一切人性，因此她现在敬拜主为她的神，不愿有人认为主是她的儿子，因为祂里面的一切都是神性。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 66</h4><p>66. It is different for the so-called saints who are in heaven. They know nothing whatever about what is happening on earth; and when I talked with them, no such idea ever came to their minds.<p>On just one occasion, Mary, the Lord’s mother, passed by. I saw her overhead, dressed in white. She paused for a moment and said that she had been the Lord’s mother and that he had indeed been born of her, but that when he became God he shed everything human that he had received from her. Now, therefore, she reveres him as her God and does not want anyone to think of him as her son, because everything in him is divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 66</h4><p>66. It is quite different with those of the so-called saints who are in heaven. They know nothing of what happens on earth; and I was unable to talk with them for fear they might gain any notion of this. Only I once saw Mary, the mother of the Lord, pass by; she appeared overhead dressed in white. She paused then for a moment to say that she had been the Lord's mother, and He had been born to her. But on becoming God He had put off everything human He had from her, and she now worships Him as her God, being unwilling for anyone to acknowledge Him as her son, since everything in Him is Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 66</h4><p>66. It is otherwise with the so-called saints who are in heaven; they know nothing at all of what is doing upon earth, nor have I spoken with them, lest any idea of this should enter their minds. Only once Mary, the mother of the Lord, passed by, and appeared over head in white raiment, and then, stopping awhile, she said that she had been the mother of the Lord, and that He was indeed born of her, but that He became God, and put off all the human from her, and that therefore she now adores Him as her God, and is unwilling that any one should acknowledge Him as her Son, because in Him all is Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 66 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>66. Aliter est sanctis ita dictis in caelo; hi prorsus nihil sciunt de eo quod in terris fit; nec cum illis locutus sum, ne aliqua idea de ea re apud illos intraret. Solum quondam praeteriit Mater Domini Maria, et visa super caput in vestitu albo; et tunc paulum morata dixit, quod Mater Domini fuerit, et quidem ab illa natus; sed factus Deus exuerit omne humanum ex illa, et quod ideo nunc adoret Ipsum ut suum Deum, et quod nolit ut quisquam Ipsum pro Filio suo agnoscat, quia in Ipso omne Divinum est. </p>
