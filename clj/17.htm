<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第17节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>17、最后的审判已经临到所有这些新教徒身上，但没有临到那些不信神，藐视圣言，从心里弃绝教会的神圣原则的新教徒身上，因为从尘世一进入灵界，这些新教徒就都被扔进了地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 17</h4><p>17. The Last Judgment was carried out on all these Protestants. It did not involve Protestants who had no belief in God, felt contempt for the Word, and threw the holy principles of the church out of their hearts, since all such Protestants had been cast into hell when they came from the earthly world into the spiritual world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 17</h4><p>17. It was on all these of the Reformed that the Last Judgment took place, but not on those who had not believed in God, had despised the Word, and at heart rejected the holy practices of the church. For all of these on coming from the natural into the spiritual world were cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 17</h4><p>17. Upon all these from the Reformed the Last Judgment was effected, but not upon those who did not believe in God, who contemned the Word, and rejected from their hearts the holy things of the church; for all these, when they came from the natural world into the spiritual world, were cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 17 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>17. Super omnes illos ex Reformatis ultimum judicium factum est, non autem super illos qui non crediderunt Deum, contempserunt Verbum, et sancta ecclesiae corde rejecerunt; nam hi omnes, dum e mundo naturali in mundum spiritualem venerunt, conjecti sunt in infernum. </p>
