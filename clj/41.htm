<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 41</h4><p>41. They seldom leave their own community in the spiritual world because they love it the way they loved their country in the physical world. They all have similar dispositions, too, which lead them to associate closely with friends from their own country, and rarely with others. They also help each other out and love honesty. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 41</h4><p>41. They rarely leave their own community, because they love it as in the world they loved their country. Their characters too exhibit such similarity that they form close friendships with their compatriots, but rarely with others. They also help one another, and like sincerity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 41</h4><p>41. They rarely go out of their own society, because they love it as in the world they love their country. There is also a similarity of minds among them, from which they contract intimacy with friends of their own country, and rarely with others. They also mutually aid each other; and they love sincerity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 41 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>41. Raro exeunt e societate sua, quia illam amant sicut in mundo patriam. Est quoque similitudo animorum inter illos, ex qua cum amicis qui ex patria eorum sunt, ligant familiaritatem, et raro cum aliis: mutuam opem etiam invicem ferunt; ac sinceritatem amant. </p>
