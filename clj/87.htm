<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第87节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>87、由于他们在灵界仍如此行，而天使却发觉他们内心不是这么想的，所以为揭露这种不一致，他们被允许进入最低层天堂。但他们无法承受那里天使的仁与信的气场，于是落荒而逃。后来，他们因在世时以为唯独他们是真实存活的，死后会进入第三层天堂，所以也被提入这层天堂。但一感觉到那里对主之爱的气场，他们就心痛难忍，开始遭受内在的痛苦，像垂死挣扎的人那样抽搐，因此从那里一头栽了下去。这些事首先表明，他们内心没有一丁点对邻之仁，也没有一丁点对主之爱。然后，他们被发送到负责检查思维内层的人那里。这些人报告说，他们贬低主，弃绝仁爱的生活，以至于厌恶它；他们认为旧约圣言毫无用处，轻视福音书的圣言。他们所接受的一切，就是从保罗书信中随意拣选的关于唯信的一些经文。这些就是摩拉维亚教徒向世人隐藏的秘密。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 87</h4><p>87. Since they continued to present themselves in this same manner in the spiritual world, and yet [the angels] perceived that their inward thoughts differed from what they were presenting outwardly, to uncover this discrepancy they were brought into the lowest heaven. They could not stand the atmosphere of caring and consequent faith among the angels there, so they hurried away.<p>Later, because in the world they had believed that they were the only people who were really alive and that after death they would enter the third heaven, they were actually taken up to that heaven. But when they sensed the atmosphere of love for the Lord there, they felt as though they were having a heart attack. They began to suffer intense inner pain and to have convulsions like people in the throes of death, so they hurled themselves headfirst out of there. This was the first method by which it was revealed that inwardly they attach no value whatever to caring for their neighbor or loving the Lord.<p>They were then sent to people charged with the task of exploring the deeper levels of their thinking. The report these people made of them was that they despise the Lord, reject the life of caring so completely that they loathe it, regard the Word of the Old Testament as useless, and look down on the Word of the Gospels. All they do with Scripture is take what they please from Paul in the passages where he talks about faith alone. Such are the mysteries that the Moravians keep hidden from the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 87</h4><p>87. They behaved similarly in the spiritual world, yet it was perceived that inwardly they did not think like this. So to disclose this they were admitted into the lowest heaven; but they could not bear the aura of charity and faith from it which came from the angels there, and they took to their heels. Afterwards, because in the world they had believed that they alone were alive, and that they would reach the third heaven, they were actually carried up to that heaven. But on perceiving the aura of love to the Lord there, they were seized with pain in the heart and began to suffer inward torments, jerking convulsively like those in a death agony; so they cast themselves down headlong. These events first showed that they had in them not a scrap of charity towards the neighbour nor of love to the Lord. Then they were sent to those whose task it is to examine the interiors of thoughts. They reported that they belittled the Lord, were so averse to a life of charity that they loathed it, they treated the Old Testament Word as useless, and slighted the Word of the Gospels. All they accepted were some arbitrarily chosen passages from Paul about faith alone. These, they reported, are the secrets they conceal from the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 87</h4><p>87. Since they did the same in the spiritual world, when yet it was perceived that interiorly they did not think so, in order that this might be disclosed, they were admitted into the lowest heaven; but they did not endure the sphere of the charity and faith of the angels there, and they fled away. Afterwards, because in the world they believed that they alone would be alive, and would enter the third heaven, they were also carried up into this heaven, but on perceiving the sphere of love to the Lord there, they were seized with anguish of heart, and began to suffer interior tortures, and to move convulsively, like those who are in the agony of death, therefore they cast themselves down headlong thence. In this manner it was first made manifest that inwardly they had cherished nothing of charity toward the neighbor, and nothing of love to the Lord. They were afterwards sent to those whose function it is to examine the interiors of the thoughts, and these said of them, that they hold the Lord in little estimation, that they reject the life of charity so as to abhor it, and that they make the Word of the Old Testament useless, and despise the Word of the Evangelists; only of their good pleasure selecting from Paul, where anything is said of faith alone; and that these are their mysteries, which they conceal from the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 87 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>87. Quoniam similiter fecerunt in mundo spirituali, et tamen perceptum est quod interius non ita cogitarent, ut hoc detegeretur, intromissi sunt in caelum ultimum; sed non sustinuerunt sphaeram charitatis et inde fidei angelorum ibi, et aufugerunt. Postea quia crediderunt in mundo, quod illi soli vivi essent, et in caelum tertium venturi, etiam in illud caelum sublati sunt; sed cum perceperunt sphaeram amoris in Dominum ibi, correpti sunt angore cordis, ac inceperunt interius cruciari, et convulsivos motus agere sicut qui in angore <sup>1</sup>mortis sunt, quare se inde praecipites dejecerunt. Per haec primum manifestatum est, quod nihil charitatis erga proximum, et nihil amoris in Dominum intus foverent. Deinde missi sunt ad illos, quibus munus explorandi interiora cogitationum injunctum est; et ab illis dictum est, quod Dominum vilipendant, charitatis vitam ita rejiciant ut illam <sup>2</sup>abhorreant, et quod Verbum Veteris Testamenti inutile faciant, ac Verbum Evangelistarum contemnant; solum ex beneplacito ex Paulo desumant ubi aliquid de sola fide dicitur; et quod haec sint arcana illorum quae pro mundo celant. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>"1. angore pro ""angone, "" nisi praetuleris agone."<p>"2. illam pro ""illum""" </p><p>
