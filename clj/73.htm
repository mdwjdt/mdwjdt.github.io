<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 73</h4><p>73. Africans, and People of Other Religions, in the Spiritual World<p>The people of other religions, who had had no knowledge of the Lord, appear farther from the center than the people who had had such knowledge. They are arranged in such a way that those who are at the farthest edge are all complete idolaters and worshipers of the sun or the moon.<p>The ones who acknowledge one God, though, and who take precepts like those of the Ten Commandments to be religious principles that determine how they live, are situated in a higher region and therefore have more direct communication with the Christians who are in the central region. Their location keeps this communication from being blocked by Muslims and Catholics.<p>People of other religions are also sorted by disposition and by their ability to receive light through the heavens from the Lord. Some of them are shallow by nature and some are deep. How deep or shallow they are is attributable not to their native soil but to the religion they practice. The Africans are by nature deeper than the rest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 73</h4><p>73. X. THE AFRICANS AND THE HEATHEN IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD <p>The heathen, who know nothing about the Lord, are to be seen surrounding those who do. Indeed the people who occupy the outermost fringes are those who are utter idolaters and worshipped the sun and the moon. Those, however, who acknowledge one God and are scrupulous in observing the kind of precepts that are in the Ten Commandments, are to be seen in the upper region, and are thus in more direct communication with the Christians in the heartland, for this prevents communication being cut off by the Mohammadens and the Roman Catholics. The heathen too are grouped according to their characters and their ability to receive light from the Lord through the heavens. Some live further in, some further out; this does not depend on their native country, but on their religion. The Africans are further in than the rest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 73</h4><p>73. X. THE AFRICANS AND THE GENTILES IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>The Gentiles who know nothing concerning the Lord, appear around those who know of Him; so that no others make the extreme circumferences but those who are altogether idolatrous, and have adored the sun and moon. But they who acknowledge one God, and make precepts like those of the Decalogue a part of religion and of life, are seen in a higher region, and thus communicate more immediately with the Christians in the center; for thus the communication is not intercepted by the Mohammedans and Papists. The Gentiles are also distinguished according to their genius and faculty of receiving light through the heavens from the Lord; for there are some of them who are more interior, and some who are more exterior; and these diversities are not derived from their place of birth, but from their religion. The Africans are more interior than the rest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 73 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>73. (X.) DE AFRICANIS ET DE GENTIBUS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI. <p>Gentes, quae non aliquid norunt de Domino, circum illos qui norunt, apparent; usque ita, ut ultimas peripherias faciant non alii quam qui prorsus idololatrae sunt, ac solem et lunam adoraverunt. Illi autem, qui unum Deum agnoscunt, ac praecepta, qualia sunt in Decalogo, religionis et vitae faciunt, conspiciuntur in regione superiore, et sic immediatius communicant cum Christianis in meditullio; nam communicatio sic non intercipitur a Mahumedanis et Pontificiis. Gentes etiam distinctae sunt secundum genios et facultates recipiendi lucem per caelos a Domino; sunt enim ex illis interiores et exteriores, quod non trahunt ex solo natali, sed ex religione: Africani sunt reliquis interiores. </p>
