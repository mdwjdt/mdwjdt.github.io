<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第64节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>64、许多天主教徒，尤其修道士，一进入灵界就寻找圣徒，各人寻找属自己宗教团体的圣徒；然而却找不到，于是他们感到困惑。不过，后来他们被别人教导，这些圣徒像普通人一样生活，要么在天堂里的人当中，要么在地狱里的人当中，这取决于他们各人在世上的生活；但无论在哪种情况下，他们都完全意识不到有人向他们敬拜或祈祷。知道并想要被召唤的人都在那个单独的地狱陷入一种精神错乱的状态。对圣徒的敬拜在天上如此可憎，以至于仅仅提到它就令天使战栗不已，因为敬拜被献给人到何等程度，就转离主到何等程度。在这种情况下，主不是敬拜的唯一对象；如果主不是敬拜的唯一对象，就会造成一种分离，这种分离会剥夺人与主的联系，以及由此所流出的生活幸福。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 64</h4><p>64. When arriving in the spiritual world, many Catholics, particularly the monks, look for their saints, especially the patron saint of their order. They are bewildered when they cannot find them. Later, others inform them that their saints are living as ordinary people, among either those in the heavens or those in the hells, depending on how they lived their life in the world; and in either case they are completely unaware that anyone is worshiping them or praying to them. (The ones who do know and who want to be prayed to are in that separate, delusional hell mentioned just above.)<p>The worship of saints is so distasteful in heaven that as soon as such worship is mentioned the angels shudder, because to the extent that worship is offered to any human, worship is diverted from the Lord. In this case, he is not the sole focus of worship, and if the Lord is not our sole focus, there is a division that robs us of our relationship with him and the happiness of life that flows from it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 64</h4><p>64. Many of the Roman Catholics, especially monks, on reaching the spiritual world look for the saints, each seeking the saint to whose order he belongs. They are surprised at not finding them. But later on they are taught that they are not kept apart from those who are in the heavens or in the hells, depending on how each has lived in the world; and that in either case they know nothing of the veneration and invocations addressed to them. Those who do know of it and wish to be called upon are in that separate hell in a state of delirium. The veneration of the saints is such an abomination in heaven that its bare mention causes horror, since in so far as veneration is directed to any human being, so far is it taken away from the Lord. For in these circumstances the Lord cannot be the sole object of veneration, and if He is not this, a separation is made which does away with communion with Him, and the happiness of life which flows from it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 64</h4><p>64. Many of the Papal nation, especially the monks, when they come into the spiritual world, seek the saints, each the saint of his own order; yet they do not find them, and therefore they wonder. But afterwards they are instructed by others, that they are either intermingled with those who are in the heavens, or with those who are in the hells, every one according to his life in the world; and that in whichsoever they are, they know nothing of the worship and invocation of themselves; and that they who know it, and wished to be invoked, are in that separate and delirious hell. The worship of saints is such an abomination in heaven, that whenever they hear of it they are horrified, because as far as worship is paid to any man, in so far it is withheld from the Lord, for thus He alone cannot be worshiped; and if the Lord is not alone worshiped, a discrimination is made, which destroys communion, and the felicity of life which flows from it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 64 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>64. Multi ex Pontificia gente, imprimis monachi, cum in mundum spiritualem veniunt, quaerunt sanctos, quisque sanctum sui ordinis; sed non inveniunt, quare mirantur: sed post instruuntur ab aliis, quod sint intermixti vel illis qui in caelis sunt vel illis qui in infernis, quisque secundum suam vitam in mundo, et quod utrobivis nihil sciant de cultu et invocatione sui; et quod qui sciunt et volunt invocari, sint in inferno illo separato et deliro. Cultus sanctorum est talis abominatio in caelo, ut dummodo audiunt illum horrescant, quoniam quantum alicui homini addicatur cultus, tantum cultus derogatur Domino; sic enim non solus potest coli; et si Dominus non solus colitur, fit discriminatio, quae tollit communionem, et fluentem ex illa felicitatem vitae. </p>
