<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">八、灵界中的天主教圣徒</h4><p>61、众所周知，人从父母那里拥有与生俱来或遗传的邪恶，但很少有人知道这恶是什么。这恶就在于对掌控他人的爱，这爱的性质是这样：它的缰绳越松开，它就越爆发出来，直到它燃烧着一种掌控所有人的欲望，最终想作为神被召唤和敬拜。这爱就是欺骗夏娃和亚当的蛇，因为蛇对女人说：</p><p>神知道，你们吃那树果子的日子，眼睛就开了，那时你们就像神一样。（创世记3:4, 5）</p><p>缰绳越松开，人就越投入这爱，越背离神，转向他自己，成为无神论者。这时，圣言的神性真理作为达到目的的手段而服务于他；但由于目的是掌控他人，所以他不喜欢手段，除非它们服务于他的目的。这就是为何那些拥有对掌控他人的爱之人，无论这爱在中间层面，还是在终极层面，都在地狱，因为这爱就是那里的魔鬼。在地狱，有些人具有这种性质，他们甚至无法忍受有人谈论神。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 61</h4><p>61. The Catholic Saints in the Spiritual World<p>It is common knowledge that we all have innate, that is, inherited, evil from our parents, but few know what that evil is. It consists of a love of controlling others. The nature of this love is that the more its reins are let out, the more it breaks forth until it becomes a burning desire to control everyone; ultimately it wants to be called upon and worshiped as God.<p>This love is the serpent that deceived Eve and Adam. It said to the woman, “God knows that on the day when you eat of the fruit of the tree your eyes will be opened, and then you will be like God” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_5.htm">5</a>). The more the reins are let out, then, and we plunge into this love, the more we turn away from God and toward ourselves and become atheists. Then the divine truths of the Word may indeed serve us as means; but since our goal is to have control over others, we take the means to heart only to the extent that is expedient for us.<p>This is why the people who have this love of controlling others, whether at an extreme level or only halfway, are all in hell. In fact, this demonic love is present wherever you encounter people who by nature cannot stand even a mention of God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 61</h4><p>61. VIII. THE SAINTS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLICS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD <p>It is well known that a person has inborn or hereditary evil from his parents, but few people know in what it consists. It consists in the love of power over others, which is so strong that to the extent it is given rein it bursts out so violently as to burn with the desire of controlling all, and finally of wishing to be invoked and worshipped as God. This love is the serpent which deceived Eve and Adam, for it said to the woman: <p>God knows that on the day you eat of the fruit of that tree, your eyes will be opened and you will then be like God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_4.htm">Genesis 3:4-5</a>. <p>To the extent, then, that a person lets go the reins and plunges into this love, he turns his back on God, and turns to himself, becoming an atheist. Then the Divine truths of the Word can serve him as means to an end; but because the end is power over others, he does not like the means except in so far as they serve his purposes. This is why those who have this love in a moderate or in the ultimate degree are all in hell, for there that love is the devil. There are some there who cannot bear to hear anyone talking about God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 61</h4><p>61. VIII. THE POPISH SAINTS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>It is known that man has from his parents implanted or hereditary evil, but in what it consists is known to few. It consists in the love of ruling, which is such, that as far as the reins are given it, so far it bursts forth, until it even burns with the lust of ruling over all, and at length of wishing to be invoked and worshiped as God. This love is the serpent, which deceived Eve and Adam, for it said to the woman: <p>God knows, that in the day ye eat of the fruit of the tree, your eyes shall be opened, and then ye shall be as God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_4.htm">Genesis 3:4-5</a>). <p>As far therefore as man rushes with loosened reins into this love, so far he turns himself away from God, and turns towards himself, and becomes an atheist; and then the Divine truths which are of the Word, may serve as means, but because dominion is the end, the means are in the heart only as they serve him. This is the reason why those who are in the mediate and in the ultimate degree of the love of ruling, are all in hell, for that love is the devil there; and in hell there are some of such a nature, that they cannot bear to hear any one speaking of God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 61 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>61. (VIII.) DE SANCTIS PONTIFICIORUM IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI. <p>Notum est, quod homini a parentibus sit malum insitum seu hereditarium, sed paucis notum est, in quo consistit. Consistit in amore imperandi, qui talis est, ut quantum, ei laxantur frena, tantum erumpat, usque ut flagret cupidine imperandi super omnes, et tandem ut velit invocari et coli sicut Deus. Hic amor est Serpens, qui decepit Evam et Adamum; dixit enim ad mulierem, <p>"Novit Deus quo die comederitis de fructu arboris, aperientur oculi vestri, et tunc eritis sicut Deus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_61/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_4-5" target=_top>Genesis 3:4-5</a>): <p>quantum itaque homo relaxatis frenis in hunc amorem ruit, tantum se avertit a Deo, et convertit ad semet, et fit atheus: et tunc possunt Divina Vera, quae sunt Verbi, inservire pro mediis; sed quia finis est dominium, media non plus cordi sunt, quam prout inserviunt. Haec causa est, quod qui in medio et qui in ultimo gradu amoris imperandi sunt, omnes in inferno sint, est enim ibi ille amor diabolus, ubi aliqui tales sunt, ut ne quidem sustineant aliquem loquentem de Deo. </p>
