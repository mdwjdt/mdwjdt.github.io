<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第67节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>67、我在此补充另一个经历。在灵界形成一个社群的巴黎人有时会看见一个女人出现在中等高度处，她衣着华丽，容貌圣洁，声称自己是热纳维耶芙。然而，一旦其中一些人开始去崇拜她，她的表情和衣服立刻就变了，变得像一个普通女人。她责备他们，因为他们想崇拜一个在她的同伴当中不过是一个女仆的女人，并为世人被这种诡计欺骗而感到惊讶。天使告诉我，她的出现是为了把敬拜人的和敬拜主的分开。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 67</h4><p>67. Here I may add another account of a memorable occurrence. To the Parisians who are together in a community in the spiritual world a woman sometimes appears in midair, wearing radiant clothes and having a saintly face. She says that she is Geneviève, but when some begin to worship her, both her face and her clothing change so that she looks like a peasant. She criticizes people for wanting to worship a woman who is no more esteemed among her friends than a servant girl would be, and marvels at the fact that people in the world are taken in by this kind of nonsense.<p>Some angels said that the reason she appears in that community is to separate worshipers of mere human beings from worshipers of the Lord there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 67</h4><p>67. I shall add here another experience. Sometimes the Parisians, who form a community in the spiritual world, see appear at a moderate height a woman dressed in shining clothing and with a saintly expression, who claims she is Genevieve. But when some people begin to venerate her, her face and her clothing change at once, and she becomes like an ordinary woman. She reproaches them for wanting to venerate a woman who is regarded by her companions as no more than a servant-girl, expressing surprise that people in the world are the dupes of such trickery. The angels told me that the reason for her appearance was to keep apart those there who venerated human beings from those who venerated the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 67</h4><p>67. I will here add this Relation. <p>A certain woman in splendid raiment and with saint-like countenance, occasionally appears in a middle altitude, to the Parisians who are in a society in the spiritual world, and tells them she is Genevieve. But as soon as any of them begin to adore her, then instantly her countenance is changed, and her raiment too, and she becomes like an ordinary woman, and chides them for wishing to adore a woman, who, among her companions, is in no more repute than a maid servant; wondering that men in the world are caught by such trifles. The angels said that she appears for the purpose of separating those there who worship man from those who worship the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 67 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>67. His adjiciam hoc memorabile. Apparet quandoque Parisiensibus qui in mundo spirituali in societate sunt, quaedam mulier in media altitudine, in vestitu splendido, et in facie tanquam sancta, et dicit se esse Genovevam: sed cum quidam incipiunt adorare illam, tunc illico mutatur ejus facies, et quoque vestis, et fit similis feminae vulgari, et reprehendit illos quod velint adorare feminam, quae apud socias suas non plus in aestimatione est quam sicut ancilla, mirans quod homines mundi talibus nugis captentur. Dicebant angeli quod illa appareat propter separationem cultorum hominis et cultorum Domini ibi. </p>
