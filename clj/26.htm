<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第26节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>26、察罚也通过天使来执行，因为凡被邪恶捆绑在一起的社群在灭亡之前，总是先有一次察罚。察罚时，天使不断敦促他们停止，改变作为，若他们不听，就以毁灭相威胁。在此期间，天使还查看有没有善灵混在他们当中，并把他们分离出来。但人群在其首领的煽动下辱骂天使，冲撞他们，企图把他们拖到公共广场，以各种难以启齿的可憎方式对待他们，就像在所多玛所行的那样。他们当中大多数人持有与仁分离之信，还有一些人虽声称仁爱是重要的，却过着邪恶的生活。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 26</h4><p>26. The reckoning was carried out by angels. Before any community that is bound together by evil comes to an end, there is always a reckoning first. During the reckoning the angels kept urging the people to change their ways and threatening them with destruction if they did not.<p>During that time the angels also explored whether there were any good people among them, and removed these from the community; but the crowds were so stirred up by their leaders that they hurled insults at the angels and charged at them, trying to drag them into the public square and torment them in all kinds of unspeakable ways. What happened there was like what happened in Sodom [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_19_1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>–<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_19_29.htm">29</a>].<p>Many of them came from a faith separated from caring; and there were a few as well who claimed to believe that caring was important but still lived wicked lives. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 26</h4><p>26. Visitations were also carried out by angels, for a visitation always takes place before a badly constructed community is destroyed. The angels kept urging them to desist, and threatening ruin if they did not. They also checked to see if there were any good people mixed in with them, and set these aside. But the crowd, whipped up by their standard-bearers, heaped insults on them, rushing at them to drag them to a public square and assault them fearfully. What happened there was like what happened in Sodom. Many of them had a faith separated from charity, and there were some who made a show of charity but still lived wicked lives. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 26</h4><p>26. Visitations also were made by angels; for before any ill conditioned society perishes, visitation always precedes. The angels exhorted them to desist, and denounced destruction upon them if they did not. Then they also sought out and separated any good spirits who were intermingled with them. But the multitude, excited by their leaders, reviled the angels, and rushed in upon them, for the purpose of dragging them into the forum, and treating them in an abominable manner; just as was done in Sodom. Most of them were in faith separated from charity; and there were also some who professed charity, and yet lived shamefully. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 26 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>26. Visitationes etiam factae sunt per angelos; nam antequam aliqua societas male sarta perit, visitatio semper praecedit. Angeli exhortabantur illos ut desisterent; et si non; denuntiabant illis exitium. Tunc etiam explorabant, num aliqui boni illis intermixti essent, quos separabant. Sed turba excitata ab antesignanis suis, contumeliis illos afficiebant, irruentes, ut in forum illos traherent, ac nefandis modis affligerent: factum est ibi sicut in Sodoma. Plerique ex illis fuerunt ex fide separata a charitate; et quoque aliqui, qui charitatem professi sunt, et usque flagitiose vixerunt. </p>
