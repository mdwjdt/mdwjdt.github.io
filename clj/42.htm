<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第42节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>42、灵界有两座类似伦敦的大城市，大多数英国人死后就来到这里；我曾被允许看见并穿过它们。其中一座城市的中心就像英国伦敦所在之地，就是商人聚会、被称为交易所的地方；那里是他们的总督所住的地方。这座城市的中心之上是东部，之下是西部，右边是南部，左边是北部。</p><p>住在东部的，是那些比其他人更致力于过仁爱生活的人；那里有宏伟的宫殿。智者住在南部，他们拥有大量辉煌、荣耀的财物。住在北部的，是那些比其他人更热爱言论和写作自由的人。住在西部的，则是那些标榜信仰的人。在西部右侧有这个城市的入口，也有一个出口；那些生活邪恶的人便从这个出口被送出去。住在西部的牧师，就是刚才所提到的那些标榜信仰的人，不敢从主道，只从窄巷进入这座城市，因为只有那些处于仁之信的人才被允许住在这城。</p><p>我听到对这些西部牧师的抱怨，说他们以如此的技巧和雄辩术来构建他们优雅的讲道，又把听众陌生的因信称义的教义交织进来，以至于听众不知道到底该不该行善。他们宣扬内在良善，并把内在良善与外在良善分离；有时他们称外在良善为邀功的，因而是不为神所悦纳的。然而，当住在这城的东部和南部的人听到这神秘的讲道时，他们就离开教堂；后来，这些牧师被剥夺了牧师职位。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 42</h4><p>42. There are actually two major cities just like London in the spiritual world. Most British people come into one or the other of them after they die. I have been granted the opportunity to see these and to walk around in them.<p>The center of one of them is [like] the part of London, England, where the merchants are concentrated, which is called the Exchange. That is where their governors live. Above that city center is the eastern quarter; below it is the western quarter; on its right side is the southern quarter, and on its left is the northern quarter. <p>[2] In the eastern quarter reside individuals who were more devoted than others to leading a life of caring. The mansions there are magnificent. The wise live in the southern quarter; they have an abundance of glorious possessions. In the northern quarter live people who more than others had loved freedom of speech and of writing. In the western quarter live individuals who profess faith [alone]. There is an entrance to the city toward the right in this last area, and there is also an exit from the city there. Individuals who live evil lives are sent away through that exit.<p>The priests who live in the west—who, as just noted, profess faith [alone]—do not dare come into the city [center] by its main streets, but enter instead by rather narrow alleys, because no one is allowed to live in the city [proper] except those who are devoted to a faith that comes from caring. <p>[3] I have heard complaints raised about the preachers from the west—that they compose their sermons with such skill and eloquence, weaving in a concept of justification by faith that is foreign to their listeners, that the listeners cannot tell whether one is supposed to do what is good or not. They preach a goodness within that they distinguish from outer goodness, sometimes calling the latter “credit seeking” and therefore unacceptable to God—though they still call it good because it is useful. However, when people from the eastern and southern quarters of the city hear sermons on these mystical topics they walk out of the building; and later those preachers are stripped of their priesthood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 42</h4><p>42. There are two large cities resembling London, to which most of the British come after death; I have been allowed to see them and to walk through them. The middle of that city is where in London, England, is the meeting place of merchants called the Exchange; that is where the governors live.<p> </p><p>[2] Beyond this centre is the east, behind it the west; the south is on the right side, the north on the left. In the eastern quarter live those who have been particularly distinguished by leading charitable lives; there are magnificent palaces there. In the southern quarter live the wise, amid much splendour. In the northern quarter live those who have above others loved freedom of speech and writing. In the western quarter live those who profess faith. On the right in this quarter is the entrance to this city, and also the way out; those who live wicked lives are sent away by it. The priests in the west, who, as I said, profess faith, do not dare to enter the city by the main streets, but only through the narrower lanes, since the only inhabitants who are tolerated in that city are those who believe in charity.<p> </p><p>[3] I have heard complaints about the preachers in the west, that they display such skill and eloquence in their elegant sermons, bringing in the dogma of justification by faith which is unknown to their hearers, that they do not know whether good is to be done or not. They preach about intrinsic good, separating it from extrinsic good, which they sometimes call merit-seeking and thus unacceptable to God. But when those who live in the eastern and southern quarters of the city hear such mystical sermons, they leave the churches; and afterwards the preachers are deprived of their priestly office. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 42</h4><p>42. There are two great cities similar to London, into which most of the English come after death; these cities it was given me to see, as well as to walk through. The middle of the one city answers to that part of the English London where there is a meeting of merchants, called the Exchange; there the governors dwell. Above that middle is the east; below it is the west; on the right side of it is the south; on the left side of it is the north. They who have led a life of charity more than the rest, dwell in the eastern quarter, where there are magnificent palaces. The wise, with whom there are many splendid things, dwell in the southern quarter. They who more than others love the liberty of speaking and of writing, dwell in the northern quarter. They who make profession of faith, dwell in the western quarter; to the right in this quarter, there is an entrance into the city, and an exit from it; they who live wickedly are there sent out of it. The presbyters, who are in the west, and who, as was said, profess faith, dare not enter the city through the broad streets, but only through the narrower ways, because they who are in the faith of charity, are the only inhabitants who are tolerated in the city. I have heard them complaining of the preachers in the west, that they prepare their discourses with such art and at the same time eloquence, interweaving justification by faith to them unknown, that they do not know whether good is to be done or not; they preach intrinsic good, and separate it from extrinsic good, which they sometimes call meritorious, and therefore not acceptable to God; yet still they call it good, because it is useful. But when those who dwell in the eastern and southern quarters of the city hear such mystical discourses, they walk out of the temples, and the preachers are afterwards deprived of the priesthood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 42 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p class="anchor" id="subsection-0-1">42. Sunt binae urbes magnae similes Londino, in quas plerique Angli post mortem veniunt; has datum est videre, et quoque perambulare. Medium istius urbis est ubi in Londino Angliae conventus mercatorum, qui vocatur Exchange; ibi habitant moderatores. Supra illud medium est oriens; infra illud est occidens; a latere dextro est meridies; a latere sinistro est septentrio. In plaga orientali habitant qui vitam charitatis prae reliquis egerunt; ibi sunt palatia magnifica: in plaga meridionali habitant sapientes, apud quos plura splendida sunt: in plaga septentrionali habitant qui prae ceteris amant libertatem loquendi et scribendi: in plaga occidentali habitant qui fidem profitentur; ad dextrum ibi in hac plaga est introitus in hanc urbem, et est exitus ab illa; illi qui male vivunt, emittuntur ibi. Presbyteri, qui in occidente sunt, qui, dictum est, fidem profitentur, non audent per plateas magnas, sed per vicos angustiores, intrare urbem, quoniam non alii habitatores in ipsa urbe tolerantur, quam qui in fide charitatis sunt. Audivi conquestos de praedicatoribus in occidente, quod sermones suos tali arte et simul eloquio concinnent, ac ignotam illis justificationem per fidem, involvant, ut nesciant num bonum faciendum sit vel non; praedicant bonum intrinsecum, et id separant a bono extrinseco, quod quandoque vocant meritorium, et sic non acceptum Deo; sed usque vocant bonum, quia utile: sed cum illi, qui in plaga urbis orientali et meridionali habitant, tales sermones mysticos audiunt, exeunt templis; et praedicatores postea deprivantur sacerdotio. </p>
