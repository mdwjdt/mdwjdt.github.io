<h4 align="center"></h4><p>57、最后审判之后，他们经历了状态的变化，即：新来的人不再允许像他们以前那样组建大的团体。相反，每种爱，无论善恶，都有被分配的道路。从世上到来的人立即踏上这些路，然后前往与他们的爱相对应的社群。恶人被带到与地狱紧密相联的社群，善人被带到与天堂紧密相联的社群。这种新安排可以防止像以前那样形成人造的天堂。像这样的社群在天堂与地狱中间的灵人界不计其数，跟良善和邪恶的爱或情感的属和种一样多。在这些社群被提入天堂或投入地狱之前这段时间，这些灵人与世人有属灵的紧密联系，因为世人也在天堂与地狱的中间。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 57</h4><p>57. After the Last Judgment circumstances in the spiritual world changed. Newly arrived people are no longer allowed to congregate in large groups as they had been doing. Now instead there are pathways assigned for every type of love, whether good or evil. People who arrive from this world immediately take these pathways, which lead them to a community that corresponds to what they love. Evil people are drawn to a community that is closely connected with the hells, and good people to a community that is closely connected with the heavens. This new arrangement prevents people from forming pseudo-heavens the way others did in the past. In the world of spirits, which is halfway between heaven and hell, there are countless communities like this. There are as many communities as there are general and specific kinds of good and evil loves; and in the interim before these communities are either taken up into heaven or cast down into hell, they have a close connection with us in this world, because we too are halfway between heaven and hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 57</h4><p>57. After the Last Judgment they underwent a change of state, so that they were not permitted to form groups as formerly. But paths were assigned to every love, whether good or evil, which newcomers from the world at once enter on, and proceed to the community answering to their love. By this means the wicked are brought to a community in touch with the hells, the good to a community in touch with the heavens. Care is thus taken to prevent the formation of artificial heavens, as happened before. There are countless communities of this kind in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, as many as there are genera and species of good and evil affections. In the meantime, before being raised to heaven or cast down to hell, these spirits are spiritually linked to people in the world, because they too are midway between heaven and hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 57</h4><p>57. After the Last Judgment, their state was so changed, that they were not allowed to gather together in companies, as before; but ways were appointed to every love, both good and evil, which those who come from the world immediately enter, and go to a society corresponding to their love. Thus the wicked are borne away to a society which is in conjunction with the hells, and the good to a society which is in conjunction with the heavens; thus precaution is taken that they may not form artificial heavens for themselves as before. Such societies in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, are innumerable; being as many as there are genera and species of good and evil affections. And in the meantime, before spirits are either elevated into heaven, or cast down into hell, they are in spiritual conjunction with men in the world, because they too are in the midst between heaven and hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 57 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>57. Post ultimum judicium status illorum ita mutatus est, quod non liceat congregare se in coetus, sicut prius; sed cuivis amori tam bono quam malo ordinatae sunt viae, quas illi, qui e mundo alluunt, illico intrant, ac vadunt ad societatem amori illorum correspondentem: sic feruntur mali ad societatem quae in conjunctione est cum infernis, ac boni in societatem quae in conjunctione est cum caelis; sic cautum est, ne sicut prius artificiales caelos sibi forment. Tales societates in mundo spirituum, qui est medius inter caelum et infernum, sunt innumerae; sunt enim totidem, quot sunt genera et species affectionum bonarum et malarum: ac interea, antequam vel in caelum elevantur, vel in infernum dejiciuntur, sunt in conjunctione spirituali cum hominibus mundi, ex causa, quia hi etiam in medio sunt inter caelum et infernum. </p>
