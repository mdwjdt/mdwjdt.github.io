<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第58节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>58、凡没有成为彻底的偶像崇拜者，而是由于自己的宗教教义出于一颗真诚的心行善，也仰望主的天主教徒都被带到建立在离新教徒最近的边界处的社群。他们在那里接受教导，拥有读给他们的圣言，并聆听关于主的讲道。那些接受这些真理并将其应用于生活的人就被提入天堂，并成为天使。每个方位都有许多这类天主教徒的社群，它们在各个方面都得到保护，以防修道士的狡猾、奸诈的诡计，以及巴比伦的酵。此外，他们所有的孩子也在天堂。这些孩子因在主的精心引导下由天使养育，故对其父母的虚假宗教信仰一无所知。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 58</h4><p>58. All Catholics who have not been outright idolaters, who have done good things with sincerity of heart because of the teachings of their religion, and who have also focused on the Lord are brought to communities that have been established near the border with the Protestants. There they are given instruction: they hear readings from the Word and sermons about the Lord, and the ones who accept these truths and apply them to their lives are taken up into heaven and become angels.<p>There are many communities of these kinds of Catholics in each region, and they are thoroughly protected against the cunning, deceitful schemes of monks and against the leaven of Babylon.<p>All Catholic children as well are in heaven. They have no knowledge of the false teachings of their parents’ religion, because they have been raised by angels under the watchful care of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 58</h4><p>58. All the Roman Catholics, provided they were not outright idolaters, but sincerely performed good actions as the result of their religious principles and also looked to the Lord, are taken to communities which have been set up next to the Reformed; there they receive instruction, have the Word read to them and the Lord is the subject of sermons. Those who accept these truths and put them into practice in life are raised up into heaven and become angels. There are many such communities of them in each quarter, and they are guarded on all sides against the guiles and cunning tricks of the monks, and against the Babylonian ferment. Moreover, all their children are in heaven, since, having been brought up by angels under the Lord's guidance, they know nothing of their parents' false religious beliefs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 58</h4><p>58. All those of the Papists, who have not been wholly idolaters, and who, from their religious persuasion, have done goods out of a sincere heart, and have also looked to the Lord, are led to societies which are instituted in the confines nearest to the Reformed, and are instructed there, the Word being read, and the Lord preached to them; and they who receive truths and apply them to life, are elevated into heaven and become angels. There are many such societies of them in every quarter, and they are guarded on all sides from the treacheries and cunning devices of the monks, and from the Babylonish leaven. Moreover, all their infants are in heaven, because, being educated by the angels under the guidance of the Lord, they know nothing of the falsities of the religion of their parents. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 58 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>58. Omnes illi ex Pontificiis, qui non prorsus idololatrae fuerunt, et ex religioso suo ex corde sincero praestiterunt bona, et ad Dominum etiam spectaverunt, perducuntur ad societates in confiniis ad Reformatos institutas, et ibi instruuntur, ac coram illis legitur Verbum, et praedicatur Dominus; et illi qui veritates recipiunt et applicant vitae, elevantur in caelum, et fiunt angeli. Tales societates ex illis sunt plures in unaquavis plaga, et undiquaque custoditae a dolosis et astutis machinationibus monachorum, aque fermento Babylonico. Praeterea omnes infantes illorum in caelo sunt, qui, quia educati per angelos sub auspicio Domini, ignorant falsa religionis parentum. </p>
