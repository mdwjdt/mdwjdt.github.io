<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十二、灵界中的贵格会教徒</h4><p>83、有些狂热的灵人与其他所有灵人分开；他们头脑如此愚蠢、迟钝，以至于自以为是圣灵。当贵格会刚刚兴起时，这些灵人就从他们所游荡的周围森林中被引出来。他们侵扰了许多人，使他们充满这种信念：他们是受圣灵驱使的。由于他们从肉体上明显感觉到作用于他们的流注，所以这种宗教信念如此占据他们，甚至到了他们自以为比其他人更神圣、更被光照的地步。结果，让他们放弃他们的宗教信念是不可能的。那些坚信不疑的人死后就会陷入类似的狂热状态；他们与其他灵人分开，并被驱逐到森林中的同类灵人当中；在那里，从远处看，他们就像野猪。那些没有坚信这些观念的人先是与其他灵人分开，然后被送到南部边缘一个类似旷野的地方，在那里有洞穴给他们作聚会敬拜之地。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 83</h4><p>83. Quakers in the Spiritual World<p>There are fanatical spirits who are convinced they are divinely inspired. They are kept apart from all others and are so thickheaded that they believe they are the Holy Spirit. When Quakerism was just beginning, these spirits were drawn forth from the surrounding forests where they had been wandering. They infested many individuals [on earth], filling them with the conviction that they were being impelled by the Holy Spirit. And because those who were infested felt an inflow physically, this conviction took possession of them all to such an extent that they believed they were holier and more enlightened than other people. As a result, they could not be induced to give up their [new] religion.<p>People who have completely convinced themselves of this come after death into the same kind of fanaticism. They are separated from others and sent away to kindred spirits in the forests, where from a distance they look like wild boars. People who have convinced themselves less completely are first separated from others and then sent to a similar place in a wilderness in the far south, where caves serve as their places of worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 83</h4><p>83. XII. THE QUAKERS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD <p>There are some spirits of the Enthusiast type who are kept apart from all others; they are of such gross insensitivity <sup><a data-toggle>1</sup>that they believe they are the Holy Spirit. When the Quaker movement began, these were brought out of the surrounding forests where they wandered, and they battened on many people, inducing the belief that they were impelled by the Holy Spirit. Because they could sensibly feel the influence acting on them, that religious persuasion totally engrossed them, so that they believed themselves to be extraordinarily enlightened and holy. For this reason it was impossible to wean them from their beliefs. Those who have become convinced of them experience a similar state of enthusiasm after death; they are separated from others and banished to join their fellows in the forests, where seen from a distance they look like wild boars. Those who have not become convinced of these ideas are separated from the others and sent away to a desert-like district on the outer fringe of the southern quarter, where caves serve them as meeting places. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Literally 'of such a fat nose'. The phrase goes back ultimately to the Roman poet Horace (Epodes 12, 3). Enthusiasts were those who believed they were personally inspired. </p><p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 83</h4><p>83. XII. THE QUAKERS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>There are enthusiastic spirits, separated from all others, of such gross perception, that they believe themselves to be the Holy Spirit. When Quakerism commenced, these spirits, being drawn out as it were from encircling forests where they were wandering, obsessed many; infusing the persuasion that they were moved by the Holy Spirit; and because they perceived the influx sensibly, they became so completely filled with this kind of religious persuasion, that they believed themselves more enlightened and holier than the rest; therefore also they could not be withdrawn from their religious persuasion. They who have confirmed themselves therein, come into a similar enthusiasm after death, and are separated from the rest, and sent away to their like in forests, where, at a distance, they appear like wild swine. But they who have not confirmed themselves, being separated from the others, are remanded to a place like a desert, in the extreme borders of the southern quarter, where they have caves for their temples. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 83 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>83. (XII.) DE QUAQUERIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI. <p>Sunt enthusiastici spiritus, separati ab omnibus aliis, tam obesae naris, ut credant se Spiritum Sanctum esse. Hi, cum Quaquerianismus incepit, sicut extracti sunt e silvis circumcirca ubi errarunt, ac obsederunt <sup>1</sup>plures, et infuderunt persuasionem quod a Spiritu Sancto agerentur; et quia sensu perceperunt influxum, religiosum istud ita occupavit illos totos, ut crederent se prae reliquis illustratos et sanctos; quare etiam a religioso suo non abduci potuerunt. Illi qui se confirmaverunt in illo, in similem enthusiasmum veniunt post mortem, ac separantur a reliquis, et ablegantur in silvas ad similes, ubi e longinquo apparent sicut sues silvestres. Illi autem qui se non confirmaverunt, separati ab aliis amandantur in locum similem deserto, qui est in ultimis plagae meridionalis, ubi speluncae sunt templa eorum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>"1. obsederunt pro ""obsiderunt""" </p><p>
