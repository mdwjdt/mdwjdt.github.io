<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第63节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>63、由于人出于遗传是这样，他想掌控别人，并且随着缰绳松开逐渐掌控更多的人，最终掌控所有人，还由于这爱的至内层就是作为神被召唤和敬拜的一种渴望，所以凡通过教皇诏书被册封为圣徒的人都从其他人的视线中移出，被藏起来并剥夺与其敬拜者的一切联系。这是为了防止最坏的恶根在他们里面被激活，以致他们陷入刚才所提到的出现在地狱中的疯狂幻想。这种妄想或说精神错乱就是那些活在世上时渴望并竭力死后成为圣徒，以便人们向他们祈祷之人的命运。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 63</h4><p>63. Given the fact that we inherit this characteristic of wanting control [over some people]—and gradually, as the reins are let out, wanting control over more people and eventually over everyone—and since at its core this love is a desire to be called upon and worshiped as God, therefore all the people who have been canonized by papal bull are moved out of sight of others and hidden away, cut off from any contact with those who worship them. This is to prevent that worst root of their inner evils from being activated, which would lead them into the delirious fantasies of the hell mentioned just above. This kind of delirium obsesses people who during their earthly lives longed and worked to become saints after death so that people would pray to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 63</h4><p>63. Human beings owe to their heredity a desire to have power over more and more people as their restraints are successively removed, and finally over all; the inmost of this love is a desire to be invoked and worshipped as a god. All therefore who have been canonised by papal bulls are taken from the sight of others and kept apart, being denied any contact with those who venerate them. This is in order to prevent that root which is the worst of evils being stirred up in them, so that they fall into such delusions of the imagination as occur in the hell just mentioned. Such delusion is the lot of those who, while they lived in the world, made great efforts to become saints after death so that they should be invoked. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 63</h4><p>63. Because man from heredity is such, that he wishes to rule, and as the reins are loosened, successively over more, and at length over all, and because the wish to be invoked and worshiped as God, is the inmost of this love of ruling, therefore all who have been made saints by the Papal bulls, are removed from the sight of others and hidden, and are deprived of all interaction with their worshipers. This is done, lest that worst root of evils should be excited in them, and they should be hurried into such fantastic deliriums as prevail in the above mentioned hell. In such deliriums are those who, when they lived in the world, have eagerly sought to be made saints after death, for the purpose of being invoked. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 63 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>63. Quoniam homo ex hereditario talis est, ut velit imperare, et successive sicut relaxantur lora, super plures, et tandem super omnes, ac intimum ejus amoris est ut velit invocari et coli ut Deus; ideo omnes qui per bullas papales sanctificati sunt, removentur ab oculis aliorum et reconduntur, et aufertur illis omne commercium cum cultoribus illorum: causa est, ne radix illa malorum pessima apud illos excitetur, et in deliria phantastica, qualia sunt supradicti inferni, inferantur. In talibus deliriis sunt illi, qui, dum in mundo vixerunt, sancti <sup>1</sup>fieri post mortem ut invocentur, studio affectarunt. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>"1. sancti pro ""sanctos""" </p><p>
