<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第89节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>89、我听说，青岑多夫死后不久进入灵界，被允许如在世时那样说话。他声称他知道天堂的秘密，除了那些信靠他的教义之人外，没有人能进入天堂。他还说，那些为了得救而行善的人完全受到诅咒，他宁愿让无神论者，也不愿让这些人加入他的会众。他说，主被父神接纳为祂的儿子，是因为祂忍受了十字架的苦难，但祂仍只是一个凡人。当被告知，主从父神成孕时，他回答说，对此，他喜欢自己的想法，只是不敢像犹太人那样谈论。此外，当我阅读福音书时，感觉到他的追随者对许多经文的反对和厌恶。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 89</h4><p>89. I heard Zinzendorf when he arrived in the spiritual world shortly after his death. He was allowed to talk just as he had previously in the world—arguing that he knew the mysteries of heaven and that no one would enter heaven except those who relied on his teaching. He insisted that those who do good deeds for the sake of salvation are utterly damned, and that he would sooner accept atheists into his congregation than them.<p>He said that the Lord was adopted by God the Father as his son because of his suffering on the cross, but that he was nevertheless just an ordinary human being. When it was explained to him that the Lord was conceived by God the Father, he replied that he thought whatever he pleased about that but did not dare to talk the way Jews did.<p>From his followers, too, I sensed multiple objections when I read the Gospels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 89</h4><p>89. I heard Zinzendorf, <sup><a data-toggle>1</sup>shortly after his arrival in the spiritual world, allowed to speak as he had done in the world. He claimed that he knew the secrets of heaven, and that no one reached heaven but those who followed his teaching. He said those who did good deeds in order to be saved were utterly damned, and he would rather welcome atheists than these into his congregation. He said that the Lord was adopted by God the Father as His son, because He had suffered the cross, but that He was still an ordinary human being. When he was told that He was conceived by God the Father, he replied that he pleased himself what he thought about that; he did not dare to speak as the Jews do. Moreover, when I read the Gospels, I was aware that his followers were shocked at many passages. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf (1700-1760), founder of the Moravian colony at Herrnhut. </p><p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 89</h4><p>89. When Zinzendorf first came into the spiritual world after death, and was permitted to speak as before in the world, I heard him asserting, that he knew the mysteries of heaven, and that no one enters heaven who is not of his doctrine; and also, that they who do good works for the sake of salvation, are utterly damned, and that he would rather admit atheists into his congregation than them. The Lord, he said, was adopted by God the Father as His Son, because He endured the cross, and that still He was simply a man. When it was said to him, that the Lord was conceived by God the Father, he replied, that he thought of that matter as he chose, not daring to speak out as the Jews do. Moreover, I have perceived many scandals from his followers, when I have been reading the Evangelists. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 89 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>89. Audivi Zinzendorfium, cum in mundum spiritualem recens post mortem venit, et admissus est loqui sicut prius in mundo, contestantem quod ille sciat arcana caeli, et quod nemo in caelum veniat nisi qui ex doctrina ejus sit; tum quod prorsus damnati sint qui bona faciunt salutis causa, et quod potius admittat atheos in suam congregationem quam illos: quod Dominus sit adoptatus a Deo Patre pro Filio Ejus, quoniam passus est crucem, et quod usque homo simplex fuerit. Cum ei dictum est quod conceptus sit a Deo Patre, respondit quod de eo cogitet sicut vult; non ausus est dicere sicut Judaei. Praeterea ab asseclis ejus percepi plura scandala cum legi Evangelistas. </p>
