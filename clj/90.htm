<h4 align="center"></h4><p>90、摩拉维亚教徒说，他们有一种感觉，让他们内心确认其教义的正确性。但向他们证明，这种感觉来自妄想灵人；这些灵人能证实一个人的宗教信仰的一切细节，甚至更充分地进入那些像摩拉维亚教徒那样热衷于自己的宗教信仰，并不断思想它的人里面。实际上，这些灵人还与他们交谈，他们都互相认识。（全书完） </p> <br><p align="center"><a href="89.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a>　 <a href="91.htm">下一节</a></p><hr />
<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 90</h4><p>90. The Moravians said they had been given a sensation and had taken this as an inner confirmation of their teachings, but they were shown that this sensation had come from delusional spirits who confirm for people whatever constitutes their religion, and that these spirits enter more fully into people who, like the Moravians, are passionate about their religion and are constantly thinking about it. There these spirits actually talked with them, and they recognized each other. </p><h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 90</h4><p>90. They say that they had a feeling which gave them an inward confirmation of the rightness of their dogmas. But it was demonstrated to them that that feeling came from spirits who see visions. These confirm all the details of a person's religious beliefs, and enter even more closely into those who, like them, love their religion and think a great deal about it. These spirits actually talked with them and they recognised one another. </p><h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 90</h4><p>90. They say, that they have a sensation, and thence an interior confirmation of their dogmas. But it was shown to them, that their sensation was from visionary spirits, who confirm a man in all his religious persuasions, and enter more closely with those, who like the Moravians, love their religious persuasion, and think much concerning it. These spirits also talked with them, and they mutually recognized each other. </p><h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 90 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>90. Dicunt se habuisse sensationem, et inde interiorem confirmationem suorum dogmatum: sed ostensum est illis, quod sensatio illorum fuerit ex spiritibus visionariis, qui apud hominem confirmant omnia ejus religiosi, et quod propius intrent apud illos, qui ut illi religiosum suum amant, et multum de eo cogitant. Illi spiritus etiam cum illis locuti sunt, et se mutuo agnoverunt. </p><br><p align="center"><a href="89.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a>　 <a href="91.htm">下一节</a></p></div>
