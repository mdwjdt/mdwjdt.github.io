<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第25节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>25、其状态的这些改变伴随着他们的房屋和地面的各种震荡；接着就是地震，地震的强度取决于他们排斥或颠倒的程度。到处有裂口向他们下面的地狱敞开，与这些地狱的交流以这种方式打开。然后，我能看见像夹杂着火花的烟雾一样的蒸汽云上腾。这些也是前兆。这就是主在福音书中论到时代的末了和那时最后的审判所说这些话的意思：</p><p>民族要起来攻打民族；各地必有大地震；天上必有又可怕又巨大的预兆。列族也有困苦，因海的咆哮和汹涌。（路加福音21:10-11, 25; 马太福音24:7; 马可福音13:8） </p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 25</h4><p>25. In connection with these changes of their state, there were various disturbances of the dwellings and lands around them, followed by earthquakes, which were massive because their [spiritual] upheavals were massive. Here and there, too, gaps opened up toward the hells that were underneath them, and in this way communication with those hells was opened. Then I could see great exhalations that looked like smoke with sparks of fire rising up.<p>These were also signs that came in advance. They were the ones meant by what the Lord said in the Gospels about the close of the age and then the Last Judgment:<p>Nation will rise against nation. There will be great earthquakes in various places. There will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven. And there will be distress of nations, the sea and the waves roaring. [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_10.htm">Luke 21:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_25.htm">25</a>] </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 25</h4><p>25. These changes in their state were accompanied by various tremors of their houses and of the ground among them, and these were followed by earthquakes, huge to match their repulsion. Here and there also chasms opened leading to the hells below them, so opening up communication with them. Then clouds of vapour like smoke mixed with fiery sparks were seen coming up. These too were precursory signs. This was the meaning of the Lord's words in the Gospels on the ending of the age and the Last Judgment at that time: <p>Nation will rise up against nation. There will be great earthquakes in various places, and mighty, terrifying signs from heaven. And the nations will be distressed at the roar and surge of the sea. [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_10.htm">Luke 21:10-11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_25.htm">25</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 25</h4><p>25. These changes of their state were accompanied by various concussions of their dwellings and lands; which were followed by earthquakes, mighty according to their perversions. Here and there, too, chasms were made towards the hells which were under them, and a communication was thus opened with them. Exhalations were then seen ascending like smoke mingled with sparks of fire. These also were signs which preceded, which are also meant by the Lord's words concerning the consummation of the age, and then concerning the Last Judgment, in the Evangelists: <p>Nation shall be stirred up against nation; there shall be great earthquakes in divers places; signs also from heaven, terrible and great. And there shall be distress of nations, the sea and the billows roaring (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_10.htm">Luke 21:10-11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_25.htm">25</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 25 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>25. Circa has mutationes status illorum, factae sunt variae concussiones habitationum et terrarum apud illos, quas secuti sunt terrae motus, ingentes secundum aversiones: et quoque hic et ibi facti sunt hiatus versus inferna, quae sub illis erant, et sic aperta est communicatio cum illis; visi tunc sunt halitus ascendentes sicut fumi commixti scintillis ignis. Haec quoque fuerunt signa, quae praecesserunt: quae etiam per Domini verba de consummatione saeculi et tunc de ultimo judicio apud Evangelistas, intelliguntur: <p>"Suscitabitur gens contra gentem;... terrae motus magni diversis locis;... terribilia quoque signa de caelo magna erunt... Et erit angustia gentium..., resonante mari et salo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_10-11" target=_top>Lucas 21:10-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_25" target=_top>25</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_7" target=_top>Matthaeus 24:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_13_8" target=_top>Marcus 13:8</a>). </p>
