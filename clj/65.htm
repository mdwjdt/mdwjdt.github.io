<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第65节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>65、为叫我知道天主教圣徒是什么样，以便公之于众，上百位知道自己被封圣的圣徒从低地被带上来。他们大多从我身后上来，只有少数人从我面前上来。我与其中一位交谈，被告知他是沙勿略。与我说话时，他就像个傻子。然而，他却能告诉我，在他被关押的地方，他不是傻子；但每当他思想自己是一个圣徒时，就会变成傻子。我听见我身后的那些人也如此嘟囔。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 65</h4><p>65. To teach me what the Catholic saints are like so that I could make the information known, a hundred or so of them who knew they had been canonized were brought up from the lower earth. Most of them rose up behind me—only a few in front of me. I talked with one who was said to have been Xavier. When he was talking with me he was behaving very foolishly. He did manage to tell me, though, that when he remained where he belonged he was not a fool, but became one whenever he thought of himself as a saint.<p>I heard a murmur to the same effect from the ones who were behind me. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 65</h4><p>65. So that I should know, and thus publish, what the saints of the Roman Catholics are like, as many as a hundred, who know of their canonisation, were brought up from the lower earth. They came up behind my back, only a few before my face. I spoke with one of them who was, I was told, Xavier. <sup><a data-toggle>1</sup>While he was speaking with me, he was like an idiot. However, he was able to relate that in his own place where he is shut up he was not an idiot, but became one as often as he thought about being a saint. I heard the same kind of murmuring from those behind my back. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Canonised in 1612. </p><p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 65</h4><p>65. That I might know, for the sake of informing others, what kind of men the Popish saints are, as many as a hundred of them, who knew of their canonization, were brought up from the lower earth. The greater part ascended from behind, and only a few in front, and I spoke with one of them, who they said was Xavier. While he talked with me, he was quite foolish, yet he was able to tell me, that in his place, where he remains confined, he is not so; but that he becomes foolish as often as he thinks that he is a saint. I heard a like murmur from those who were behind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 65 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>65. Ut scirem quales sancti Pontificiorum sunt, propter causam ut notum facerem, educti sunt ex inferiore terra usque ad centum, qui noverunt de sanctificatione sua. Ascenderunt a tergo, modo aliqui ante faciem, et cum uno ex his locutus sum, quem dixerunt fuisse Xaverium: hic dum mecum loquebatur, erat prorsus fatuus; narrare tamen potuit, quod in loco suo, ubi inclusus manet, non fatuus sit, sed quod fatuus fiat quoties cogitat quod sanctus sit. Simile murmur audivi ab illis qui a tergo erant. </p>
