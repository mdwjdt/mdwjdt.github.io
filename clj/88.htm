<h4 align="center"></h4><p>88、由此清楚可知，他们对主的看法就像阿里乌派的，他们轻视先知书和福音书的圣言，恨恶仁爱的生活，尽管整个天堂都倚靠这三者，如同倚靠三根支柱。此后，那些知道并相信他们秘密的人被判定为敌基督者，他们弃绝基督教会的三个基本信仰，即：主的神性，圣言和仁爱。他们被逐出基督教界，进入靠近贵格会教徒的南部边界的一个旷野。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 88</h4><p>88. So it became clear that the Lord is someone they regard as Arians do, that the Word of the prophets and of the Gospels is something they despise, and that the life of caring is something they hate, when in fact these are the three pillars on which all heaven rests. Therefore the ones among them who knew and believed in these mysteries were judged to be antichrists who rejected the three essential beliefs of the Christian church—the divine nature of the Lord, the Word, and caring. They were cast out of the Christian world into a wilderness that is at the border of the southern region, near the Quakers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 88</h4><p>88. It was demonstrated that their view of the Lord was like that of the Arians, that they slighted the Word of the Prophets and the Evangelists, and that they hated a life of charity, although the whole heaven depends upon these three as it were columns. After this those who knew and believed in their secrets were judged as antichrists, rejecting the three essentials of the Christian church: the Divinity of the Lord, the Word and charity. They were expelled from the Christian world into the desert which lies at the edge of the southern quarter near the Quakers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 88</h4><p>88. After it was made manifest that they acknowledge the Lord only as the Arians do, that they despise the Word of the Prophets and Evangelists, and hold a life of charity in hatred, when yet upon these three things as on pillars the whole heaven depends; then they who were in the knowledge and at the same time in the belief of their mysteries, were adjudged Anti-Christs, who reject the three essentials of the Christian church, namely, the Divine of the Lord, the Word, and charity, and were cast outside the Christian world into a desert, which is in the end of the southern quarter near the Quakers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 88 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>88. Postquam manifestatum est, quod Dominum sicut Ariani agnoscant, quod Verbum Prophetarum et Evangelistarum contemnant, et quod charitatis vitam odio habeant, cum tamen super tribus illis ut columnis universum caelum pendet, tunc illi qui in cognitione et simul in fide illorum arcanorum fuerunt, judicati sunt ut Anti-Christi, qui rejiciunt tria essentialia Ecclesiae Christianae, nempe Divinum Domini, Verbum, et charitatem, et conjecti extra Christianum orbem in desertum, quod in fine plagae meridionalis prope Quaqueros est. </p>
