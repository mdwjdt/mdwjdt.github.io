<h4 align="center"></h4><p>30、⑷绵羊得救。最后的审判完成后，天堂里有了喜乐，灵人界也有了前所未有的光明。那龙被抛下去之后，天堂里的喜乐及其性质在启示录（12:10-12）有所描述。而灵人界之所以有了光明，是因为这些像遮蔽大地的乌云那样横亘在中间的地狱社群被移除了。然后，一种类似的光也出现在世人中间，给他们带来新的启示。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 30</h4><p>30. 4. The salvation of the sheep. After the Last Judgment was accomplished, joy broke out in heaven and a greater light than ever broke forth in the world of spirits. The nature of the joy in heaven after the dragon was cast down is described in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12</a>. Light broke forth in the world of spirits because those hellish communities had been in the way like clouds that were darkening the earth. A similar light then arose on us in this world, too, bringing us a new enlightenment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 30</h4><p>30. (iv) The salvation of the sheep. When the Last Judgment was completed there was joy in heaven and such an increase of light in the world of spirits as never before. There is a description of what the joy in heaven was like after the dragon was cast down in Revelation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_10.htm">Revelation 12:10-12</a>). The light in the world of spirits was due to the removal of those hellish communities which had come between like clouds overshadowing the earth. A similar light also dawned on people in the world, bringing them a new enlightenment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 30</h4><p>30. The salvation of the sheep. After the Last Judgment was accomplished, there was then joy in heaven, and also light in the world of spirits, such as was not before. The joy in heaven and its quality, after the dragon was cast down, is described in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_10.htm">Apocalypse 12:10-12</a>); and there was light in the world of spirits, because those infernal societies had been interposed like clouds which darken the earth. A similar light also then arose with men in the world, from which they had new enlightenment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 30 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>30. ((iv.)) De salvatione Ovium. Postquam ultimum judicium peractum est, tunc factum est gaudium in caelo, et quoque facta lux in mundo spirituum, qualis non prius fuerat: gaudium in caelo, quale, postquam draco dejectus est, describitur in Apocalypsi (cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_10-12" target=_top>12:10-12</a>); et lux in mundo spirituum, quia societates illae infernales interpositae fuerunt sicut nubes, quae obtenebrant terram: similis lux etiam tunc exorta est hominibus in mundo, ex qua illis nova illustratio. </p>
