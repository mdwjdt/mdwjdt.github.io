<h4 align="center"></h4><p>29、然后，我看见他们所站的一些岩石正在下沉，一直沉到最低的深处；有的被带到很远的地方，有的从中间裂开，站在上面的人通过裂口被扔下去；有的似乎被洪水淹没。我看见许多人照着邪恶的属和种而集结成群，好像捆成捆被四处扔进漩涡、沼泽、滞水池和沙漠，其中每一处都是一个地狱。剩下的没有站在岩石上的人则分散到各个方向；他们因具有相似的邪恶，故在惊愕中逃到天主教徒、伊斯兰教徒和外邦人或异教徒那里，并声称信奉他们的宗教。他们做起这种事来毫无心理障碍，因为他们没有任何宗教信仰。但为了防止他们迷惑这些人，他们被赶走并推下地狱，加入他们的同伴。这是对他们命运的大致描述，我看到的细节太多了，无法在此讲述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 29</h4><p>29. Then I saw what happened to the rocks people were living on: some of them sank to the deepest depths, some were carried far away, some split open in the middle so that the people living on them were cast down into a cave, and some were submerged as if by a flood. I saw the many people on them gathered into groups like bundles, sorted by types and subtypes of evil, and cast far and wide into whirlpools, swamps, marshes, and deserts, all of which were hells.<p>The rest, who did not live on those rocks but on either side of them (even though they were given to the same kinds of evil), fled thunderstruck to the Catholics, Muslims, and people of other religions and professed those religions. They could do this without even changing their minds because they actually had no religion. To prevent them from leading the others in those religions astray, though, they were driven off and forced down to live with their true companions in the hells.<p>This provides a general outline of their fate. The details of what I saw are more than can be described here. </p>

I then saw some of the rocks on which they stood sinking down to the lowest depths, some carried off to the far distance, some split open in the middle, and those who stood on them cast down through a cave. Some of the rocks were covered as by a flood. Many of the people were gathered into groups to match their general and particular kinds of evil; they were made as it were into bundles and tossed hither and thither into chasms, marshes, pools and deserts, each of which was a hell. The remainder who were not standing on the rocks were scattered in different directions, and since they shared similar evils, in their amazement they ran for refuge to the Roman Catholics, the Mohammedans and the heathen, and claimed to have their religion. They could do this without mental upset because they lacked any religion. But to prevent them leading these people astray they were driven away and thrust down to join their companions in the hells. This is a general description of their fate; but the details of what I witnessed are too many to relate here. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 29</h4><p>29. Then I saw some of the rocks upon which they were, subsiding even to the lowest depths; some carried far away; some opening in the middle, and those who were on them cast down through the chasm; and some inundated as with a flood. And I saw many collected into companies, as into bundles, according to the genera and species of evil, and cast hither and thither into whirlpools, marshes, stagnant pools, and deserts, which were so many hells. The rest who were not on rocks, but scattered here and there, and who yet were in similar evils, fled amazed to the Papists, Mohammedans, and Gentiles, and professed their religions, which they could do without any disturbance of mind, because they had no religion; but still lest they should seduce these also, they were driven away, and thrust down to their companions in the hells. This is a general description of their destruction; the particulars which I saw, are more than can be here described. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 29 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>29. Vidi tunc petras, super quibus erant, quasdam subsidentes usque ad ima; quasdam translatas in longinqua; quasdam apertas in medio; et per antrum dejectos qui supra erant; quasdam inundatas sicut diluvio; ac multos secundum genera et species mali collectos in coetus, sicut in fasciculos, et conjectos huc illuc in voragines, paludes, stagna et deserta, totidem inferna: reliqui, qui non super petris erant, hinc illinc dispersi, et tamen in similibus malis, attoniti aufugerunt ad Pontificios, Mahumedanos et Gentes, ac religionem illorum fassi sunt; hoc potuerunt absque motione animi facere, quia illis nulla religio fuerat; sed usque ne quoque illos seducerent, abacti sunt, et ad socios suos in infernis detrusi. Hoc fuit exitium illorum universaliter descriptum; particularia, quae vidi, sunt plura quam ut hic describi possint. </p>
