<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 27</h4><p>27. 3. An outline of what happened during the judgment. The reckoning and the signs foretelling the coming judgment could not make them give up their criminal behavior. Nothing could deter them from their plots to overthrow everyone who acknowledged the Lord as God of heaven and earth, held the Word to be holy, and lived a caring life. As a result, the Last Judgment came upon them; it happened in the following way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 27</h4><p>27. (iii) How the universal judgment took place. When the visitations and signs announcing the judgment to come were unable to deter their minds from criminal acts and seditious plots against those who acknowledged the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, and who treated the Word as holy and led lives of charity, the Last Judgment came upon them. It took place thus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 27</h4><p>27. III. How the universal Judgment was effected. <p>After the visitations and premonitory signs of the coming Judgment could not turn their minds from criminal acts, and from seditious plottings against those who acknowledged the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, held the Word holy, and led a life of charity, the Last Judgment came upon them. It was thus effected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 27 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>27. (iii.) Universale Judicium quomodo factum est.- Postquam visitationes et signa praenuntia futuri judicii animos illorum ab actibus facinorosis, et quoque a machinationibus seditiosis contra illos qui agnoscebant Dominum pro Deo caeli et terrae, sanctum habebant Verbum, et vitam charitatis agebant, deflectere non potuerunt, supervenit ultimum judicium. Hoc ita factum est. </p>
