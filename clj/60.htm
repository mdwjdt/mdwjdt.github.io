<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第60节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>60、我在此补充一段难忘的经历：我被允许与现任法国国王的祖父路易十四交谈；他在世时敬拜主，阅读圣言，认为教皇不过是教会的负责人而已。他在灵界享有很高的地位，并管理着一个最优秀的法国人社群。有一次，我看见他仿佛从一段楼梯上下来；在他走下楼梯后，我听见他说，他觉得自己好像在凡尔赛宫。然后沉默了大约两个小时，之后他说，他刚刚与他的曾孙，法国国王谈论了教皇的独子通谕，告诉他要放弃他之前的立场，不要接受这个通谕，因为这对法兰西民族不利。他说，他已经把这个想法深深印在现任国王的脑海里。这事发生于1759年12月13日晚上八点左右。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 60</h4><p>60. I may add to this an account of a memorable occurrence. I was granted an opportunity to talk with Louis XIV, the great-grandfather of the present king of France, who during his earthly life had worshiped the Lord, read the Word, and recognized the pope as no more than the head of the church. In the spiritual world he therefore has a highly honored position, governing the best community of people from France.<p>I saw him once apparently going down a flight of stairs, and after he had done so I heard him say that it seemed to him as though he were at Versailles. Then there was silence for a couple of hours, after which he said that he had just talked with his great-grandson, the king of France, about the Bull Unigenitus, saying that he himself no longer held his former position on it; he now did not accept the bull, because it was detrimental to the French nation. He said that he had impressed this thought very deeply upon the current king’s mind.<p>This happened at about 8 p.m. on December 13, 1759. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 60</h4><p>60. I may add here the account of an experience. I was allowed to talk with Louis XIV, the grandfather <sup><a data-toggle>1</sup>of the present king of France, who when he was in the world worshipped the Lord, read the Word, and recognised the Pope as no more than head of the church. He therefore holds very high rank in the spiritual world and is the ruler of an excellent community of Frenchmen. I once saw him as it were coming down a staircase; and on coming down I heard him say that it was like being at Versailles. Then there was silence for about two hours, after which he said that he had talked with his grandson the king of France about the Papal Bull Unigenitus, telling him to abandon his previous intention and to reject it as harmful to the French nation. He said that he had instilled this idea deep into his thoughts. This happened on the thirteenth of December 1759, around eight o'clock in the evening. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;More accurately, great grandfather. </p><p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 60</h4><p>60. Here I am allowed to add something memorable. It was granted me to speak with Louis XIV., grandfather of the reigning king of France, who while he was in the world, worshiped the Lord, read the Word, and acknowledged the Pope only as the highest one of the church; in consequence of which, he has great dignity in the spiritual world, and rules the best society of the French nation. Once I saw him as it were descending by ladders, and after he descended I heard him saying, that he seemed to himself as if at Versailles, and then there was silence round about for half an hour; at the end of that time, he said, that he had spoken with the king of France, his grandson, concerning the Bull Unigenitus, advising him to desist from his former design, and not to accept it, because it was detrimental to the French nation, he said that he insinuated this into his thought profoundly. This took place in the year 1759, on the 13th day of December, about eight o'clock in the evening. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 60 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>60. His adjicere licet aliquod memorabile. Datum est loqui cum Ludovico XIV., avo Regis Galliarum hodie regnantis, qui, dum in mundo fuit, coluit Dominum, legit Verbum, et Pontificem modo pro supremo ecclesiae agnovit; quare in mundo spirituali in multa dignitate est, ac optimam societatem gentis Gallicae regit. Quondam illum vidi sicut descendentem per scalas; et postquam descendit, audivi illum dicentem, quod videretur sibi sicut Versaliis esset, et tunc factum est silentium per bihorium circiter; quo peracto dixit se locutum esse cum Rege Galliae, nepote suo, de Bulla Unigenitus; quod desisteret a priori suo consilio, et illam non acceptaret, quia detrimentosa genti Gallicae; dixit quod hoc insinuaverit cogitationi ejus profunde. Hoc factum est anno 1759, die 13 Decemb., vesperi circa horam octavam. </p>
