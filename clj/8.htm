<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">二、最后的审判前后世界和教会的状态</h4><p>8、前面阐述的事实足以证明，最后的审判已经在灵界发生。但为了对审判前后世界和教会的状态有所了解，知道以下事实是很有必要的：</p><p>⑴何谓过去的先前的天和先前的地（启示录21:1）。</p><p>⑵先前天地的居民是谁，是什么样。</p><p>⑶在对他们进行最后审判之前，天堂与世界、因而主与教会之间的大量交流被阻断。</p><p>⑷最后审判之后，这种交流得以恢复。</p><p>⑸这就是为何对新教会的启示在最后审判之后，而非之前作出。</p><p>⑹最后审判之前，世界和教会的状态就像傍晚和黑夜，但审判之后则像早晨和白昼。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 8</h4><p>8. The State of the World and the Church before and after the Last Judgment<p>What has been said above shows that the Last Judgment has already taken place in the spiritual world; but if there is to be any knowledge about the state of the world and the church before and after that judgment, the following information is essential.<p>1. What is meant by the first heaven and the first earth that passed away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<p>2. Who the people of the first heaven and the first earth were and what they were like.<p>3. Before the Last Judgment on these people was carried out, much of the communication between heaven and earth, and also therefore between the Lord and the church, was blocked.<p>4. Since the Last Judgment, that communication has been restored.<p>5. That is why revelations for the new church were given after the Last Judgment and not before.<p>6. The state of the world and the church before the Last Judgment was like evening and nighttime; after it, the state is like morning and daytime. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 8</h4><p>8. II. THE STATE OF THE WORLD AND THE CHURCH BEFORE AND AFTER THE LAST JUDGMENT <p>The facts stated above are enough to prove that the Last Judgment has taken place in the spiritual world. But to acquire some knowledge of the state of the world and the church before and after that event, the following facts need to be known. <p>(i) What is meant by the former heaven and the former earth which passed away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). <p>(ii) Who the inhabitants of the former heaven and earth were and what they were like. <p>(iii) Before the Last Judgment was carried out on them, much of the communication between heaven and the world, and so between the Lord and the church, was blocked. <p>(iv) After the Last Judgment this communication was restored. <p>(v) This is why revelations have been made for the New Church after, and not before, the Last Judgment. <p>(vi) The state of the world and the church before the Last Judgment resembled evening and night, but after it morning and day. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 8</h4><p>8. II. THE STATE OF THE WORLD AND OF THE CHURCH BEFORE THE LAST JUDGMENT, AND AFTER IT. <p>That the Last Judgment has been accomplished in the spiritual world, may appear from what has just been said. Nevertheless, in order to know anything of the state of the world and the church before and after it, it is altogether necessary that the following things should be known: <p>I. What is meant by "the former heaven" and "the former earth" which passed away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Apocalypse 21:1</a>). <p>II. Who, and of what quality were those who were in the former heaven and in the former earth. <p>III. Before the Last Judgment was effected upon them much of the communication between heaven and the world, thus also between the Lord and the church, was intercepted. <p>IV. After the Last Judgment the communication was restored. <p>V. Hence it is, that after the Last Judgment, and not before, revelations were made for the New Church. <p>VI. The state of the world and of the church before the Last Judgment was like evening and night, but after it like morning and day. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 8 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>8. (II.) DE STATU MUNDI ET ECCLESIAE ANTE ULTIMUM JUDICIUM, ET POST ILLUD. <p>Quod ultimum judicium in mundo spirituali peractum sit, constare potest ex illis quae nunc supra dicta sunt: at vero ut aliquid sciatur de statu mundi et ecclesiae ante illud et post illud, omnino scienda sunt haec:- <p>(i.) Quid intelligitur per "prius caelum" et per "priorem terram" quae transiverunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_8/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:1</a>). <p>(ii.) Quinam et quales fuerunt qui in priore caelo et in priore terra. <p>(iii.) Quod antequam ultimum judicium super illos falsum est, multa communicatio inter caelum et mundum, ita quoque inter Dominum et Ecclesiam, intercepta fuerit. <p>(iv.) Quod post ultimum judicium communicatio restituta sit. <p>(v.) Quod inde sit, quod post ultimum judicium, et non prius, revelationes pro Nova Ecclesia factae sint. <p>(vi.) Quod status mundi et ecclesiae ante ultimum judicium fuerit sicut vespera et nox; post illud autem sicut mane et dies. </p>
