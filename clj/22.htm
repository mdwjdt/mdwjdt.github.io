<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第22节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>22、这些事实清楚表明，受到最后审判的，是哪种新教徒；它没有临到在中心区域的人，而是临到在周围区域的人。如前所述，后者出于外在的道德表面上看像基督徒，但内在并不是基督徒，因为他们没有属灵的生活。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 22</h4><p>22. With this in mind we can tell which Protestants were subject to the judgment. It was not the ones who were in the central area but those around them, who, as noted, seemed to be Christians because of their outward morality but who were not Christians inwardly, because they had no spiritual life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 22</h4><p>22. These facts make it evident which of the Reformed it was who were subject to judgment, not those who are in the heartland, but those in the surrounding area. As said before, their outward show of morality made these look outwardly like Christians, but inwardly they were no Christians since they lacked spiritual life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 22</h4><p>22. From these things it may appear, upon whom of the Reformed the Last Judgment was effected; that it was not upon those who were in the center, but upon those who were around it; who from external morality, as was said, appeared exteriorly like Christians, but interiorly they were not Christians, because they had no spiritual life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 22 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>22. Ex his constare potest, quinam ex Reformatis sunt, super quos judicium factum est; quod non super illos qui in meditullio sunt, sed super illos qui circum illud; qui, ut dictum est, exterius sicut Christiani ex moralitate externa apparuerunt, sed interius non Christiani ex nulla spirituali vita fuerunt. </p>
