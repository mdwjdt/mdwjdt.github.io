<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判（续）》 第12节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>12、⑸这就是为何对新教会的启示在最后审判之后，而非之前作出。最后的审判带来交流的恢复之后，人们就能被光照和改造。这意味着他们能理解圣言的神性真理，接受他们所理解的，并保持他们所接受的，因为横亘在中间的障碍已经清除。因此，先前的天和先前的地过去后，约翰说：</p><p>他看见一个新天新地，又看见圣城耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。他听见坐宝座的说，看哪，我将一切都更新了。（启示录21:1-2, 5）</p><p>“耶路撒冷”表示教会，对此，可参看《耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（62-64节）；关于它的新教义（可参看那里的65节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (New Century Edition 2020) 12</h4><p>12. 5. That is why revelations for the new church were given after the Last Judgment had taken place and not before. This is because once communication is restored by the Last Judgment we can be enlightened and reformed. That is, we can understand the divine truth of the Word, accept it as something we understand, and retain it as something we have accepted. The obstacles have in fact been removed. So John says that after the first heaven and the first earth passed away, he saw a new heaven and a new earth, and then saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband; and he heard the one who sat on the throne say, “Behold, I am making all things new” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>).<p>On Jerusalem as meaning a church, see <a href="../lord/62.htm">Teachings on the Lord 62</a>–<a href="../lord/64.htm">64</a>, and for new principles taught by that church, see <a href="../lord/65.htm">65</a> there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1975) 12</h4><p>12. (v) This is why revelations have been made for the New Church after, and not before, the Last Judgment. After the Last Judgment brought about the restoration of communication, people have been able to be enlightened and reformed. This means that they have been able to understand the Divine truth of the Word, accept what they have understood and retain what they have accepted, because the intervening obstacles have been taken away. John therefore, after the former heaven and the former earth passed away, says that he had seen a new heaven and a new earth, and then the holy city of Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband. And he heard the One who sat on the throne saying, 'Look, I am making everything new' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>). Jerusalem means the church; see in <a href="../lord/62.htm">THE TEACHING ABOUT THE LORD 62-64</a> and on its new doctrines (<a href="../lord/65.htm">THE TEACHING ABOUT THE LORD 65</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuation of The Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1914) 12</h4><p>12. V. Hence it is, that after the Last Judgment has been accomplished, and not before, revelations were made for the New Church. For since communication has been restored by the Last Judgment, man can be enlightened and reformed; that is, can understand the Divine truth of the Word, receive it when understood, and retain it when received, for the interposing obstacles are removed; and therefore John, after the former heaven and the former earth passed away, said that: <p>He saw a New Heaven and a New Earth, and then, the holy city Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride before her Husband; and he heard the One sitting upon the throne, say, Behold, I make all things new (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Apocalypse 21:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>). <p>That the church is meant by "Jerusalem" may be seen in Teachings about the <a href="../lord/62.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Respecting the Lord 62-64</a>. Concerning its new things (see Teachings about the <a href="../lord/65.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Respecting the Lord 65</a> there). </p>
<h4 align="center">Continuatio de Ultimo Judicio 12 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>12. (v.) Quod inde sit quod post ultimum judicium peractum, et non prius, revelationes pro Nova Ecclesia factae sint; nam postquam per ultimum judicium communicatio restituta est, potest homo illustrari et reformari, hoc est Divinum verum Verbi intelligere, illud intellectum recipere, ac receptum retinere, obstacula enim interjecta remota sunt: quare Johannes, postquam prius caelum et prior terra transivit, dicit se <p>Vidisse novum caelum et novam terram; et tunc urbem sanctam Hierosolymam descendentem a Deo e caelo, paratam sicut sponsam coram marito suo: et audivit Sedentem super throno dicentem, "Ecce nova omnia facio" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_12/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1-2" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_12/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_5" target=_top>5</a>); <p>quod per "Hierosolymam" intelligatur ecclesia, videatur in Doctrina de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_12/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_62" target=_top>62-64</a>); ac de novis ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_12/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_65" target=_top>65</a> ibi). </p>
