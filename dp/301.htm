<h4 align="center"></h4><p>301、天堂天使是对良善的情感和由此而来的真理的思维，因为他们是来自主的神性之爱和神性智慧的接受者。对良善的一切情感皆来自神性之爱，真理的一切思维皆来自神性智慧。但地狱灵是对邪恶的欲望和由此而来的虚假的幻想，因为他们陷入了自我之爱和自己的聪明；对邪恶的一切欲望皆来自自我之爱，虚假的一切幻想皆来自人自己的聪明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 301</h4><p>301. Angels in heaven are embodiments of affections for good and the accompanying thoughts of truth because they are recipient vessels of Divine love and wisdom from the Lord - all affections for good originating from Divine love, and all thoughts of truth from Divine wisdom. <p>Spirits in hell, on the other hand, are lusts for evil and the accompanying suppositions of falsity because they are governed by self-love and their own intelligence, and all lusts for evil arise from self-love, and suppositions of falsity from one's own intelligence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 301</h4><p>301. The reason heaven's angels are desires for what is good and a consequent recognition of truth is that they are receptive of divine love and wisdom from the Lord, and all desires for what is good come from divine love, and all recognition of truth comes from divine wisdom. On the other hand, the reason all spirits of hell are obsessions with evil and consequent illusions of falsity is that they are wrapped up in their self-love and in their own intelligence, and all obsessions with evil come from self-love, and all illusions of falsity come from our own intelligence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 301</h4><p>301. The angels of heaven are affections of good and thoughts of truth arising from these because they are recipients of the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom from the Lord; for all affections of good are from the Divine Love, and all thoughts of truth are from the Divine Wisdom. On the other hand, the spirits of hell are lusts of evil and imaginations of falsity thence derived because they are in the love of self and in their own intelligence, and all lusts of evil are from the love of self, and the imaginations of falsity are from one's own intelligence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 301</h4><p>301. The angels of heaven are affections for good and consequent thoughts of truth, because they are recipients of Divine love and Divine wisdom from the Lord. All affections for good are from the Divine love, and all thoughts of truth are from the Divine wisdom. But the spirits of hell are lusts of evil and consequent imaginations of falsity, because they are in the love of self and in their own intelligence, and all lusts of evil are from the love of self, and the imaginations of falsity are from one's own intelligence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 301 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>301. Quod Angeli coeli sint affectiones boni et inde cogitations <sup>1</sup>veri, est quia sunt recipientes Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae a Domino, ac omnes affectiones boni sunt ex Divino Amore, et omnes cogitationes veri sunt ex Divina Sapientia: quod autem spiritus inferni sint concupiscentiae mali et inde imaginationes falsi, est quia in amore sui sunt et in propria intelligentia, et omnes concupiscentiae mali sunt ex amore sui, ac imaginationes falsi sunt ex propria intelligentia.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: cogitatianes </p>
