<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第81节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>81、如果一个人认为这些邪恶是可允许的，那么即便他不去作，这些邪恶也会成为他的一部分；因为凡在思维上认为可允许的事，都来自意愿，因为那时有同意。因此，当一个人认为某种具体的邪恶是可允许的时，他就把它从内在约束中释放出来，仅仅因为外在约束，也就是惧怕而不去做它。由于他的灵钟爱这恶，所以一旦外在约束被除去，他就会随心所欲地行出来。与此同时，他不断在灵里行这恶。关于这个主题，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》<a href="../life/108.htm">（108-113节）</a>。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 81</h4><p>81. The evils that a person believes allowable, even if he does not do them, also become attached to him, for making them allowable in the thought springs from the will, the two being in accord. Consequently, when a person believes some evil allowable, he dissolves any internal bond against it, and is kept from doing it only by external bonds, which are fears. Moreover, because the person's spirit inclines to that evil, therefore if the external bonds are removed he does it as allowable. And meanwhile he continually does it in his spirit. <p>But on this subject, see in <a href="../life/108.htm">The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 108-113</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 81</h4><p>81. If we believe that particular evils are permissible, then they do become part of us even though we do not do them, since the permission we grant them in our thought comes from our intent, and there is an agreement. As a result, when we believe that some particular evil is permissible, we have relaxed the inner restraint against it and are kept from doing it only by outward restraints, which are fears. <p>Since our spirit is cherishing this evil, once the outward restraints are removed we feel free to do it. In the meanwhile, we are constantly doing it in our spirits. On this subject, though, see Teachings about Life for the New Jerusalem 108-113. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 81</h4><p>81. The evils which a man believes to be allowable, even though he does not commit them, are also appropriated to him; since whatever is allowable in the thought comes from the will, for then there is consent. When, therefore, a man believes any evil to be allowable, he loosens an internal restraint upon it, and he is withheld from doing it only by external restraints, such as fears; and because his spirit favours that evil, when external restraints are removed he does it as allowable; and meanwhile, he continually does it in his spirit. But concerning this see THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM (n. <a href="../life/108.htm">108-113</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 81</h4><p>81. Again, such evils as a man believes to be allowable, even though he does not do them, are appropriated to him; since whatever is made allowable in the thought comes from the will, for there is then consent. When, therefore, a man believes any evil to be allowable, he releases it from internal restraint; and is withheld from doing it only by external restraints, which are fears. And because his spirit then favors that evil, whenever external restraints are removed he does it as allowable and in the mean time continually does it in his spirit. But respecting this, see the <a href="../life/108.htm">Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 108-113</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 81 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>81. Mala quae homo licita credit, tametsi non facit illa, etiam ei appropriantur, nam licitum in cogitatione est ex voluntate, est enim consensus; quare cum homo credit aliquod malum licitum, solvit vinculum internum pro illo, ac detinetur a faciendo illud solum per vincula externa, quae sunt timores; et quia spiritus hominis favet isti malo, ideo remotis vinculis externis ex licito facit illud; ac interea continue facit illud in suo spiritu: sed de hac re videatur in <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_81/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_108">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 108-113</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 videatur in ubi in prima editione videarin </p>
