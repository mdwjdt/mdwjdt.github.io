<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第35节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>35、然而，不要让人以为他知道许多东西，在某种程度的光中感知到它们，并能明智地谈论它们，就算有智慧了，除非他的智慧与爱结合。因为正是爱通过它的情感产生智慧。智慧若不与爱结合，就像空中消失的流星，又像陨落的星星。与爱结合的智慧则像永恒的阳光，又像一颗恒星。当一个人击退地狱团伙，也就是对邪恶和虚假的欲望时，他就拥有对智慧的爱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 35</h4><p>35. Let no one suppose, however, that someone has wisdom if he knows many things, if he perceives them in some degree of light, and if he can discuss them intelligently, unless that wisdom is conjoined with love. For it is love through its affections that produces wisdom. If wisdom is not conjoined with love, it is like an atmospheric phenomenon in the sky that vanishes, or like a falling star. On the other hand, wisdom conjoined with love is like the enduring light of the sun, or like a stationary star. <p>A person has a love of wisdom to the extent that he shuns the devil's crew, which are the lusts of evil and falsity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 35</h4><p>35. No one, though, should believe that we have wisdom if we know a lot, grasp what we know fairly clearly, and can talk about things intelligently. We are wise only if these abilities are united to love. Love is what produces wisdom, through its desires. If wisdom is not united to love it is like a meteor in the sky that vanishes, like a falling star. Wisdom united to love is like the constant light of the sun and like a fixed star. We have a love for wisdom to the extent that we fight off the demonic horde--our cravings for whatever is evil and false. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 35</h4><p>35. But let no one believe that a person has wisdom because he knows many things, and perceives them in a certain light, and can talk about them intelligently, unless that wisdom is conjoined to love. For it is love through its affections that produces wisdom; and if it is not conjoined to love, it is like a meteor that vanishes in the air, and like a falling star. When wisdom, however, is conjoined to love, it is like the abiding light of the sun, and like a fixed star. A man has the love of wisdom so far as he turns away from the infernal crew, which are the lusts of evil and falsity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 35</h4><p>35. But let no one believe that a man has wisdom because he knows many things, and perceives them in some light, and is able to talk about them intelligently, unless this is conjoined with love; for it is love through its affections that produces wisdom; and wisdom not conjoined with love is like a meteor vanishing in the air, and like a falling star. But when wisdom is conjoined with love it is like the abiding light of the sun, and like a fixed star. A man has a love of wisdom so far as he turns away from the diabolic crowd, which are the lusts of evil and falsity. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 35 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>35. Sed ne credat aliquis, quod sapientia alicui sit, quod sciat multa, et quod percipiat illa in quadam luce, et quod intelligenter possit loqui illa, nisi illa sit conjuncta amori; amor enim per suas affectiones producit illam; si non conjuncta est amori, est sicut meteoron in aere quod evanescit, et sicut stella cadens; at sapientia conjuncta amori, est sicut solis lux manens, et sicut stella fixa: amor sapientiae est homini, quantum aversatur diabolicam turbam, quae sunt concupiscentiae mali et falsi. </p>
