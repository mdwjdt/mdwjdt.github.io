<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第304节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>304、这些快乐因构成具体的每个人和总体的所有人的生命，故不会被那些身在其中的人感觉到；但当对立面靠近时，尤其当它们转化为气味时，这些对立面就会被感觉到，因为每种快乐都对应于一种气味，并且在灵界可转化为气味。那时，在天堂，一种共享的快乐闻上去就像一个花园，并照着它所包含的花果的香味而具有多样性。而在地狱，一种共享的快乐闻上去则像排入了各种污水的死水，并照着它里面的腐烂难闻之物的恶臭味而具有多样性。我被允许得知人们如何感觉天堂里对良善的每种情感的快乐，以及地狱里对邪恶的每种欲望的快乐；不过，在此解释起来需要占用大量篇幅。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 304</h4><p>304. These delights which constitute everyone's life individually, and the life of all in common, are not something of which people occupied in them are consciously aware; but they are consciously aware of their opposites when these are in the vicinity, especially when they turn into odors. For every delight corresponds to some odor, and in the spiritual world may be turned into it. The common delight in heaven then smells like the odor of a garden, with variety according to the fragrances emanating there from flowers and fruits. And the common delight in hell smells like stagnant water into which different kinds of filth have been thrown, with variety according to the stenches emanating from the rotting and foul-smelling things in it. <p>I have, moreover, been granted to know how the delight of each affection for good in heaven feels, and the delight of the lust for evil in hell, but it would take too long to present it here. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 304</h4><p>304. Since these pleasures constitute the life of each individual and of everyone in general, they are not sensed by the people who have them; but the opposite ones are sensed when they come near. This happens especially when they are turned into odors. Every pleasure has a corresponding odor, and in the spiritual world it can be turned into its odor. When this happens in heaven, a shared pleasure smells like a garden, varying depending on the scents of the particular flowers and fruits it contains. A shared pleasure in hell smells like stagnant water into which different kinds of sewage have been discharged, varying depending on the particular stenches of the decaying and putrid matter in it. <p>I have been shown how people feel the pleasure of each particular desire for what is good in heaven and the pleasure of each obsession with evil in hell, but it would take too long to present that now. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 304</h4><p>304. As these delights constitute the life of everyone in particular and of all in general, they are not felt by those in them, but their opposites are felt when they approach, especially when these are turned into odours; for every delight corresponds to an odour, and in the spiritual world may be converted into it. Then the common delight in heaven is perceived as the odour of a garden varied according to the fragrance there from flowers and fruits; while the common delight in hell is perceived as the odour of stagnant water, into which filth of various kinds has been thrown, varied according to the foul odour there from reeking, putrid matter. Moreover, it has been granted me to know how the delight of any particular affection of good is felt in heaven, and how the delight of any lust of evil in hell, but it would be tedious to explain it here. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 304</h4><p>304. Inasmuch as these delights constitute the life of every one in particular and of all in general, they are not felt by those who are in them, but their opposites are felt when they approach, especially when they are turned into odors; for every delight corresponds to an odor, and in the spiritual world may be converted into an odor; and then the general delight in heaven is sensed as the odor of a garden, with variety according to the varieties of fragrance there from flowers and fruits, while the general delight in hell is sensed as stagnant water into which different kinds of filth have been thrown, with variety according to the bad odors from putrid and offensive things therein. How the delight of each affection for good in heaven and the delight of the lust of evil in hell is felt it has been granted me to know; but it would require too much space to explain it here. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 304 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>304. Jucunda illa, quia faciunt vitam cujusvis in singulari, et omnium in communi, non sentiuntur ab illis qui in illis sunt, sed opposita sentiuntur quando appropinquant, imprimis cum vertuntur in odores, quodlibet enim jucundum correspondet odori, ac in spirituali mundo in illud converti potest; et tunc sentitur commune jucundum in coelo, sicut odor horti, cum varietate secundum fragrantia ibi ex floribus et fructibus; et commune jucundum in inferno sentitur sicut stagnata aqua in quam conjectae sunt diversae sordes, cum varietate secundum maleolentia ex putribus et nidorosis inibi. Quomodo autem jucundum cujusvis affectionis boni in coelo, et jucundum concupiscentiae mali in inferno, sentitur, datum etiam est scire, sed prolixum foret hic illud exponere. </p>
