<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第20节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>20、那些处于邪恶，同时又处于真理的人，好比在头顶上高飞的老鹰，但当被剥去翅膀时，就会坠落。因为那些理解真理，谈论并教导它们，在生活上却不转向神的人，死后成为灵人时就是这种情况。他们的理解力把他们举到高处；他们有时进入天堂，伪装成光明天使。但当他们被剥夺真理并逐出时，就会投入地狱。此外，鹰表示拥有理性视觉的掠夺者，翅膀表示属灵真理。我提到过，他们就是那些在生活上不转向神的人。在生活上转向神是指要想到这样或那样的恶是反对神的罪，因而不去作恶。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 20</h4><p>20. People impelled by evil and at the same time by truths may be likened to eagles which fly on high, but which fall when their wings are taken from them. For something similar happens to people after death when they become spirits if they have understood truths, given voice to them, and taught them, and yet have not looked at all to God in their life. By their intellectual attainments they raise themselves on high, and sometimes enter the heavens and feign themselves angels of light; but when their truths are taken from them and they are expelled, they fall down into hell. <p>Eagles also symbolize predatory people who possess an intellectual sight, and wings symbolize spiritual truths. <p>We have said that such is the character of people who have not looked at all to God in their life. To look to God in one's life means simply to think that this or that evil is a sin against God, and for that reason not to do it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 20</h4><p>20. People who are involved in evil and in truth at the same time can be compared to eagles that soar high overhead but plunge down if they lose their wings. Something like this happens to people after death, when they become spirits, if they have understood, discussed, and taught truths but have never turned to God in their lives. Their comprehension lifts them on high; and sometimes they get into heaven and pretend to be angels of light. However, when they are deprived of their truths and dismissed, they plunge into hell. Eagles mean predatory people who have intellectual vision, and wings mean spiritual truths. <p>I mentioned that these are people who never turn to God in their lives. "Turning to God in our lives" simply means thinking that some particular evil action is a sin against God and therefore not doing it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 20</h4><p>20. Those who are in evil and at the same time in truths may be compared to eagles that soar on high, but drop down when deprived of their wings; for so do those men after death when they have become spirits, who have understood truths, have spoken about them and have taught them, and yet have had no regard to God in their life. By means of the things of their own understanding they raise themselves on high, and sometimes enter the heavens and feign themselves angels of light; but when they are deprived of their truths and cast out, they fall down to hell. Moreover, eagles signify men of a predatory nature who are endowed with intellectual sight, and wings signify spiritual truths. It was said that such were those men who had no regard to God in their life. By having regard to God in the life is meant considering that this or that evil is a sin against God and therefore not doing it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 20</h4><p>20. Those who are in evil and also in truth may be likened to eagles that soar aloft, but drop when deprived of the use of their wings; for thus the men do after death, when they have become spirits, who have understood truths, have talked about them, and have taught them, and yet have not looked to God at all in their life. Such by means of the things in their understanding raise themselves on high, and sometimes enter the heavens and feign themselves angels of light; but when deprived of truths and cast out, they fall down to hell. Moreover, eagles signify rapacious men who are endowed with intellectual sight; and wings signify spiritual truths. As just said, these are such as have not looked to God in their life. To look to God in the life means nothing else than thinking this or that evil to be a sin against Him, and for that reason not doing it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 20 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>20. Illi qui in malo sunt et simul in veris, comparari possunt aquilis, quae alte volant, quae, dum illis ablatae sunt alae, decidunt: similiter enim faciunt homines post mortem, dum spiritus facti sunt, qui intellexerunt vera, loquuti sunt illa, et docuerunt illa, et tamen nihil spectaverunt ad Deum in vita sua; illi per intellectualia sua se elevant in altum, et quandoque intrant coelos, et mentiuntur angelos lucis; at cum illis auferuntur vera, et emittuntur, decidunt <sup>1</sup>in infernum. Aquilae etiam significant homines rapinae, quibus visus intellectualis est, et alae significant vera spiritualia. Dictum est, quod tales sint illi, <sup>2</sup>qui nihil spectaverunt ad Deum in vita sua; per spectare ad Deum in vita, non aliud intelligitur quam cogitare hoc aut illud malum esse peccatum contra Deum; et ideo non facere illud.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: dicidunt<p>2 Prima editio: llli, </p>
