<h4 align="center"></h4><p>8、从前面的论点明显可知，在主里面为一体且作为一体从主发出的神性之爱与神性智慧，以某种形像存在于祂所创造的每一个事物中。现在有必要具体说一说被称为良善与真理的婚姻的一体或结合。<p>①该婚姻在主自己里面，因为如前所述，神性之爱与神性智慧在祂里面为一。<p>②该婚姻来自主，因为在从主发出的一切事物中，爱与智慧都完美地结合在一起，两者从显为太阳的主发出，神性之爱就像热，神性智慧就像光。<p>③它们的确被天使和教会之人作为两样东西来接受，但在他们里面被主合而为一。<p>④鉴于作为一体来自主的爱和智慧的这种流注与天堂天使和教会之人同在，也鉴于天使和世人对它的接受，在圣言中，主被称为新郎和丈夫，天堂和教会被称为新妇和妻子。<p>⑤因此，只要总体的天堂和教会，以及具体的一位天使和一个教会之人处在良善和真理的这种结合或婚姻中，他们就是主的一个形像和样式。因为良善和真理在主里面为一，事实上就是主。<p>⑥当意愿和理解力，因而良善和真理合而为一时，或也可说，当仁和信合而为一时，亦或说，当取自圣言的教义和照之的生活合而为一时，爱和智慧在总体的天堂和教会中，以及具体的一位天堂天使和一个教会之人里面就为一。<p>⑦此外，至于这两者如何在人里面和属于他的一切事物中合而为一，这在《圣爱与圣智》一书的第五部分已经说明，那里论述了人的创造，尤其论述了意愿和理解力与心和肺的对应关系<a href="../dlw/358.htm">（358-432节）</a>。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 8</h4><p>8. From the preceding discussion it is apparent that Divine love and wisdom, which in the Lord are united, and which emanate from the Lord as one, are present in some image of them in everything created by Him. Now we shall say something in particular also about that unity or union which we call the marriage of good and truth. <p>1. This marriage exists in the Lord Himself. For as we said, Divine love and wisdom in Him are united. <p>2. This marriage originates from the Lord. For present in everything that emanates from Him are love and wisdom totally united. These two emanate from the Lord as a sun - Divine love as heat, and Divine wisdom as light. <p>3. These are received by angels, indeed, as two distinct entities, but they are united in them by the Lord. The same is the case with people of the church. <p>4. It is owing to the influx of love and wisdom from the Lord as one in angels in heaven and in people of the church, and to their reception by angels and people, that the Lord is called in the Word a bridegroom and husband, and heaven and the church a bride and wife. <p>5. Consequently to the extent that heaven and the church as a whole, and an angel in heaven and a person of the church individually, are governed by that union or by a marriage of goodness and truth, to the same extent they are an image and likeness of the Lord, since these two are united in the Lord, and indeed are the Lord. <p>6. Love and wisdom are united in heaven and in the church as a whole, and in an angel in heaven and in a person of the church, when the will and intellect, thus when goodness and truth, are united, or to say the same thing, when charity and faith are united. Or to say the same thing again, when doctrine from the Word and one's life in accordance with it are united. <p>7. How these two are united in a person and in all of his constituents we have shown in our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, Part 5, where we discussed the creation of mankind, and especially the correspondence of the will and intellect with the heart and lungs, <a href="../dlw/358.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 358-432</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 8</h4><p>8. We can see from the preceding section that in everything that has been created by the Lord there is a kind of image of the divine love and wisdom that are a unity in the Lord and that emanate from the Lord as a single whole. Now I need to say something more specific about the unity or union that is called the marriage of goodness and truth. <p>(a) This marriage is in the Lord himself, since as already noted divine love and wisdom are a unity in him. (b) It is from the Lord, since love and wisdom are completely united in everything that emanates from him. They both emanate from the Lord as the sun--divine love as warmth and divine wisdom as light. (c) Angels accept them as two, but the Lord unites them within the angels; and the same holds true for people of the church. (d) It is because of the inflow of love and wisdom from the Lord as a single whole into angels of heaven and people of the church and because of their acceptance by angels and people that the Lord is called the bridegroom and husband in the Word and the church is called the bride and wife. (e) To the extent, then, that heaven and the church in general, or angels of heaven and people of the church in particular, participate in this union, or in the marriage of goodness and truth, they are images and likenesses of the Lord. This is because these two realities are a single whole in the Lord and in fact are the Lord. (f) In heaven and the church in general, and in angels of heaven and people of the church in particular, love and wisdom are a single whole when volition and discernment (and therefore goodness and truth) form a single whole, or what is the same thing, when charity and faith form a single whole; or what is also the same thing, when a belief system from the Word and a life according to it form a single whole. (g) I have, however, explained how these two realities form a single whole in us and in all aspects of our being in part 5 of Divine Love and Wisdom, where I dealt with our creation and especially with the correspondence of our volition and discernment to our heart and lungs [<a href="../dlw/358.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 358-432</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 8</h4><p>8. From the preceding article it is evident that the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, which in the Lord are one, and which proceed from the Lord as one, are in a certain manner imaged in everything created by Him. Something will now be said specifically about that oneness or union which is called the marriage of good and truth. That marriage is<p>(1) in the Lord Himself; for, as has been said, the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom are one in Him.<p>(2) It is from the Lord; for in everything that proceeds from Him love and wisdom are perfectly united, these two proceeding from the Lord as the Sun, the Divine Love as heat, and the Divine Wisdom as light.<p>(3) These are, indeed, received by the angels as two, but are united in them by the Lord; and the same takes place with men of the Church.<p>(4) Because of the influx of love and wisdom from the Lord as one with the angels of heaven and men of the Church, and because of the reception of these by angels and men, the Lord is called in the Word Bridegroom and Husband, and heaven and the Church are called Bride and Wife.<p>(5) So far, therefore, as heaven and the Church in general, and an angel of heaven and a man of the Church in particular, are in that union, that is, in the marriage of good and truth, they are an image and likeness of the Lord; because good and truth in the Lord are one, and, indeed, are the Lord.<p>(6) Love and wisdom in heaven and in the Church in general, and in an angel of heaven and in a man of the Church, are one when the will and the understanding, and thus good and truth, make one; or, what is the same, when charity and faith make one; or, what is still the same, when doctrine from the Word and a life according to it make one.<p>(7) Moreover, how these two make one in man and in all things pertaining to him has been shown in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, part V., where the creation of man and especially the correspondence of the will and the understanding with the heart and the lungs are treated of (n. <a href="../dlw/358.htm">358-432</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 8</h4><p>8. From a preceding article it is evident that the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, which in the Lord are one, and which go forth as one from the Lord, in a certain image are in every thing created by Him. And now something shall be said specifically about that oneness or union that is called the marriage of good and truth. That marriage is: <p>(1) In the Lord Himself; for Divine love and Divine wisdom, as has been said, are a one in Him. <p>(2) It is from the Lord; for in every thing that goes forth from Him love and wisdom are fully united, these two going forth from the Lord as a sun, the Divine love as the heat, and the Divine wisdom as the light. <p>(3) These are, indeed, received by the angels as two, but are made one in them by the Lord; and the same is true of men of the church. <p>(4) Because of this influx of love and wisdom from the Lord as a one into angels of heaven and men of the church, and because of the reception of these by angels and men, the Lord is called in the Word the "Bridegroom" and the "Husband," and heaven and the church are called the "bride" and the "wife." <p>(5) Therefore, so far as heaven and the church in general or an angel of heaven and a man of the church individually are in that union, that is, in the marriage of good and truth, they are an image and likeness of the Lord, because good and truth are a one in the Lord, and, in fact, are the Lord. <p>(6) In heaven and in the church in general, or in an angel of heaven or a man of the church, love and wisdom are a one when the will and the understanding, and thus good and truth, make a one, or what is the same, when charity and faith make a one, or what is still the same, when doctrine from the Word and a life according to it make a one. <p>(7) How these two make a one in man and in all things belonging to him has been shown in the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, in Part Five, where the creation of man and especially the correspondence of the will and understanding with the heart and lungs are treated of (<a href="../dlw/358.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 358-432</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 8 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>8. Ex Articulo praecedente patet, quod Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, quae in Domino unum sunt, et a Domino ut unum procedunt, sint in quadam imagine in omni creato ab Ipso; nunc etiam aliquid in specie de uno illo, seu unione, quae vocatur conjugium boni et veri, dicetur. Conjugium illud est, <sup>1</sup><p>I. In Ipso Domino; nam ut dictum est, Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia in Ipso unum <sup>2</sup>sunt. <p>II. Est ex Domino, nam in omni quod procedit ex Ipso, sunt amor et sapientia prorsus unita; illa duo procedunt a Domino ut Sole, Divinus Amor sicut Calor, et Divina Sapientia sicut Lux. <p>III. Recipiuntur illa ab Angelis quidem ut duo, sed uniuntur apud illos a Domino: simile fit apud homines Ecclesiae. <p>IV. Ab influxu amoris et sapientiae a Domino ut unum apud angelos coeli et apud homines Ecclesiae, et a receptione illorum <sup>3</sup>ab angelis et hominibus, est quod Dominus in Verbo dicatur Sponsus et Maritus, ac Coelum et Ecclesia <sup>4</sup>Sponsa et Uxor. <p>V. Quantum itaque Coelum et Ecclesia in communi, ac angelus coeli et homo ecclesiae in particulari, est in unione illa, seu in conjugio boni et veri, tantum imago et similitudo Domini sunt; quoniam illa duo in Domino unum sunt, imo sunt Dominus. <p>VI. <sup>5</sup>Amor et sapientia in Coelo et in Ecclesia in communi, ac in Angelo coeli et in Homine ecclesiae unum sunt, quando Voluntas et Intellectus, ita quando bonum et verum, unum faciunt, seu quod idem, quando charitas et fides unum faciunt; seu quod adhuc idem, quando doctrina ex Verbo et vita secundum illam unum faciunt. <p>VII. Quomodo autem duo illa unum faciunt in homine et in omnibus ejus, ostensum est in Transactione de DIVINO AMORE <sup>6</sup>ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA, in Parte Quinta, ubi actum est de Creatione hominis, et imprimis de Correspondentia voluntatis et intellectus cum corde et pulmone, a <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_8/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_358">358-432</a> <sup>7</sup>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: est.<p>2 Prima editio: uuum<p>3 Prima editio: illoum<p>4 Prima editio: Ecclesa<p>5 Prima editio: VI,<p>6 Prima editio: ANORE<p>7 Prima editio: 385 </p>
