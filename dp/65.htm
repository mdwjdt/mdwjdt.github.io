<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第65节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>65、由于整个天堂在主面前如同一个人，所以天堂被划分为跟一个人里面的器官、内脏和肢体一样多的总体社群；每个总体社群又被划分跟内脏和器官的主要部分一样多的不那么总体或具体的社群。由此明显可知天堂是什么样。由于主是本质的人，天堂是祂的形像，所以在天堂里面被称为在主里面。主是人本身，或本质的人，这一点可见于《圣爱与圣智》一书<a href="../dlw/11.htm">（11-13</a>，<a href="../dlw/285.htm">285-289节）</a>。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 65</h4><p>65. Since the whole of heaven in the Lord's sight is as though a single person, heaven has therefore been distinguished into as many general societies as there are organs, viscera and members in the human being, and every general society into as many less general or particular societies as there are larger components in each of the viscera and organs. It is apparent from this what the nature of heaven is. <p>Now because the Lord is supremely human, and heaven is an image of Him, therefore people say that to be in heaven is to be in the Lord. (That the Lord is supremely human may be seen in our treatise <a href="../dlw/11.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 11-13</a>, <a href="../dlw/285.htm">285-289</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 65</h4><p>65. Since the whole heaven is like a single person in the Lord's sight, heaven is divided into as many inclusive bodies as there are organs, viscera, and members in us; and each larger community is divided into as many less inclusive or specific communities as there are major parts of our viscera and organs. We can see from this what heaven is like. <p>Now, since the Lord is the essential Person and heaven is an image of him, we refer to being in heaven as "being in the Lord." On the Lord as the essential person, see <a href="../dlw/11.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 11-13</a>, <a href="../dlw/285.htm">285-289</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 65</h4><p>65. Since the universal heaven is in the sight of the Lord as one man, therefore heaven is divided into as many general societies as there are organs, viscera and members in a man; and each general society is divided into as many less general or particular societies as there are larger divisions in each of the viscera and organs; and from this it is clear what the nature of heaven is. Now, because the Lord is Man Himself, and heaven is His image, therefore to be in heaven is called being in the Lord. That the Lord is Man Himself may be seen in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM (n. <a href="../dlw/11.htm">11-13</a>, <a href="../dlw/285.htm">285-289</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 65</h4><p>65. As in the Lord's sight the entire heaven is as one man, so heaven is divided into as many general societies as there are organs, viscera, and members in a man; and each general society is divided into as many less general or particular societies as there are larger divisions in each of the viscera and organs. From this it is evident what heaven is. And since the Lord is the very Man, and heaven is His image, to be in heaven is called being in the Lord. That the Lord is the very Man can be seen in <a href="../dlw/11.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 11-13</a>, <a href="../dlw/285.htm">285-589</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 65 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>65. Quoniam universum Coelum in conspectu Domini est sicut unus Homo, ideo Coelum in tot Societates communes distinctum est, quot sunt organa, viscera et membra apud hominem; et unaquaevis Societas communis in tot societates minus communes seu particulares, quot sunt partes majores cujusvis visceris et organi: ex quo patet quale coelum est.
