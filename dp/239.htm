<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第239节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>239、如今，那些出于内在思维唯独支持自然和人类谨慎的人，又添加了更多论据，以进一步确认他们的观点。如：整个基督教界都承认三神，殊不知，神在位格和本质上都为一，主就是这一位神；迄今为止，人们还不知道，圣言的每一个细节里面都有一个灵义，这灵义是它神圣的基础；人们也不知道，避恶如罪就是基督教的本质；同样不知道，人死后作为一个人活着。因为人们私下里彼此说：“圣治若真的存在，为何到现在才揭示这些事？”</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 239</h4><p>239. To these arguments may be added still more today, which can be used by people who think inwardly on the side of nature and human prudence alone to further confirm themselves - as for example, that the whole Christian world has acknowledged three Gods, not knowing that God is one in person and essence, and that that God is the Lord. Further, that Christians have previously not known of the existence of a spiritual meaning in every particular of the Word, and that this meaning is the reason for its holiness. So too, that they have not known that to refrain from evils as sins is the essence of Christian religion. And that they have also not known that a person lives as a person after death. For they say to themselves and to each other, "Why does Divine providence - if it exists - now reveal these things for the first time?" </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 239</h4><p>239. Nowadays, too, people whose inner thoughts favor the material world and human prudence alone could add more to the arguments they use to justify their position. There is the fact, for example, that all Christendom worships three gods, not realizing that God is one in person and in essence and that he is the Lord. There is also the fact that until now people have not known that there is spiritual meaning in the details of the Word and that this is the basis of its holiness. There is also ignorance of the fact that the essence of the Christian religion is to abstain from evils as sins and ignorance of the fact that we go on living as people after death. Skeptics can say privately and to each other, "If there is a divine providence, why is it only now revealing things like this?" </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 239</h4><p>239. To these arguments more may be added at this day by which those can still further confirm themselves who think interiorly in favour of nature and human prudence alone. For example:<p>I. The whole Christian world has acknowledged three Gods, not knowing that God is one in Person and in Essence, and that He is the Lord.<p>2. Hitherto it has not been known that in every particular of the Word there is a spiritual sense from which it derives its holiness.<p>3. Further, it has not been known that to shun evils as sins is the Christian religion itself.<p>4. Also it has not been known that a man lives a man after death. For men can say to themselves and to one another, Why does the Divine Providence, if there is any, now reveal such things for the first time? </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 239</h4><p>239. To these arguments others can be added at this day by which those who think interiorly in favor of nature and human prudence alone may still further confirm themselves; as that the whole Christian world has acknowledged three Gods, not knowing that God is one in person and in essence, and that the Lord is this one God; also that it has not hitherto been known that in every particular of the Word there is a spiritual sense, and that its holiness is from this; also that it has not been known that to shun evils as sins is the Christian religion itself; and that it has not been known that man lives a man after death. For men can say to themselves and to one another, Why does the Divine providence, if there is any, now first reveal such things? </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 239 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>239. His argumentis possunt hodie plura addi, per quae adhuc confirmare se possunt, qui interius pro natura et pro sola humana prudentia cogitant; ut quod totus Orbis Christianus agnoverit tres Deos, nescientes quod Deus unus sit persona et essentia, et quod Ille sit Dominus. Tum quod huc usque nesciverint, quod in singulis Verbi sensus spiritualis sit, et quod sanctitas ejus inde sit. Ut et, quod nesciverint, quod fugere mala sicut peccata, sit ipsa Religio Christiana: Et quoque quod nesciverint, quod homo vivat homo post mortem: possunt enim secum et inter se dicere, cur Divina Providentia, si sit, talia nunc primum revelat. </p>
