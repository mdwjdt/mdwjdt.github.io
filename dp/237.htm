<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第237节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>237、凡拜自己和自然的人，当看到世上那么多不敬虔的人做出那么多不敬虔的事，甚至为此夸耀，却不见神因此作出任何惩罚时，都确认反对圣治。当看到反对虔诚、公义和诚实之人的阴谋诡计甚至也能得逞；在司法和商业领域，不义战胜公义时，更是确认反对圣治。当看到不敬虔的人在政府和教会中位高权重，声名显赫，财富充足，生活奢侈；而另一方面，敬拜神的人却穷困潦倒时，尤其确认反对圣治。当想到战争被允许发生，导致那么多人被屠杀，那么多城市、民族和家庭被洗劫，以及胜利在谨慎的一方，有时不在公义的一方；指挥官是否是一个义人无关紧要，以及其它类似的事时，他也确认反对圣治；然而，按照圣治的律法，这一切都是被允许的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 237</h4><p>237. Every worshiper of self and worshiper of nature confirms himself against Divine providence when he sees so many impious people in the world, and so many impieties committed by them, and at the same time some people's glorying on account of them, yet without their incurring any punishments from God in consequence. <p>Still more does he confirm himself against Divine providence when he sees that crafty schemes, cunning tactics and false pretenses succeed, even against people who are pious, just and honest, and that injustice triumphs over justice in the courts and in business dealings. <p>Especially does he so confirm himself when he sees impious people raised to positions of honor and becoming great men and prelates, abounding as well in riches and living in luxury and magnificence, while worshipers of God are by contrast held in contempt and live in poverty. <p>He confirms himself against Divine providence also when he considers that wars are permitted, and in them the slaughter of so many people and the plundering of so many cities, nations and families; moreover that victories occur on the side of prudence, and not always on the side of justice; and that it makes no difference whether the commanding officer is an upright person or not - besides many other like considerations, all of which are permissions in accord with laws of Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 237</h4><p>237. Everyone who worships self and the material world instead of divine providence feels justified in this on seeing so many irreverent people acting out their irreverence in so many ways and even boasting about it, and still not seeing any kind of punishment from God because of this. Such people feel even more justified in their rejection of divine providence when they see the success of manipulation, plots, and deceit, especially against people who are devout, fair-minded, and honest, and when they see injustice defeating justice in legal and business affairs. <p>Above all, they feel justified when they see irreligious people raised to high rank, getting positions of power in government and the church, amply supplied with wealth, and living in ostentatious luxury, while people who worship God are living in disgrace and poverty. <p>People who worship themselves and the material world justify their rejection of divine providence as well when they think that wars are permitted, in which so many people are killed and so many cities, nations, and families plundered. Further, victories come to the prudent side and sometimes not to the just side. It does not matter, either, whether the commander is a person of integrity or not, and so on. All these matters are instances of permission under the laws of divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 237</h4><p>237. Every worshipper of himself and of nature confirms himself against the Divine Providence.<p>1. When he sees in the world so many wicked people, and so many of their impieties in which some of them even glory, and yet no punishment of such by God. He confirms himself still more against the Divine Providence when he sees that wicked designs, cunning devices and deceit are successful even against the pious, the righteous and the sincere; and that injustice triumphs over justice in the courts and in business.<p>2. Especially does he confirm himself when he sees the impious advanced to honours and become great in the state and leaders in the Church, and that they abound in riches and live in luxury and magnificence; while, on the other hand, he sees the worshippers of God living in contempt and poverty.<p>3. He also confirms himself against the Divine Providence when he reflects that wars are permitted, and in them the slaughter of so many men and the plundering of so many cities, nations and families.<p>4. Moreover, that victories are on the side of prudence and sometimes not on the side of justice, and that it makes no difference whether the general is an upright man or not.<p>He sees besides other things like these; and yet they are all permissions according to the laws of the Divine Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 237</h4><p>237. Every worshiper of himself and of nature confirms himself against the Divine providence when he sees in the world so many impious persons, and so many of their impieties, and at the same time the glorying of some in these impieties, and yet no punishment of such by God on this account. And he confirms himself against the Divine providence still further when he sees that plots, devices, and frauds are successful even against the pious, just, and sincere; and that injustice triumphs over justice in the courts and in business. Especially does he confirm himself in this when he sees the impious exalted to honors and to high offices in church and state, also abounding in wealth, and living in luxury and magnificence; while on the other hand he sees the worshipers of God despised and poor. He also confirms himself against Divine providence when he reflects that wars are permitted, and the consequent slaughter of so many men, and the plundering of so many cities, nations, and families; also that victories are on the side of prudence, and sometimes not on the side of justice; and that it makes no difference whether the commander is an upright man or not; besides other things like these; all of which are permissions according to the laws of the Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 237 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>237. Omnis cultor sui et cultor naturae contra Divinam Providentiam se confirmat, cum in mundo videt tot impios, et tot illorum impietates, et simul quorundam gloriationes ex illis, et usque non aliquas illorum punitiones propterea a Deo. Et magis contra Divinam Providentiam se confirmat, cum videt quod succedant machinationes, astutiae et doli, etiam contra pios, justos et sinceros: et quod injustitia triumphet super justitiam in judiciis et in negotiis. Imprimis se confirmat, cum videt impios ad honores evehi, ac fieri magnates et primates; <sup>1</sup>tum etiam abundare divitiis, ac vivere in lautis et magnificis; et vicissim cultores Dei in contemtu et paupertate. Contra Divinam Providentiam etiam se confirmat, cum cogitat quod permittantur bella, ac tunc tot hominum neces, ac tot urbium, gentium et familiarum depraedationes: et quoque quod victoriae stent a parte prudentiae, et quandoque non justitiae; et quod non aliquid faciat, si praefectus sit probus vel sit improbus; praeter similia alia: quae omnia sunt permissiones secundum leges Divinae Providentiae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: primates: </p>
