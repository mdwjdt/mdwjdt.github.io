<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第205节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>205、⑹那些只承认自然和人类谨慎的人构成地狱，而那些承认神和祂的圣治之人构成天堂。凡过着邪恶生活的人内心都只承认自然和人类谨慎；这种承认就深深潜藏于一切邪恶，无论它如何被良善和真理掩饰。这些掩饰不过是借来的衣服，或易凋谢的花环，被披戴来隐藏邪恶，免得它赤身露体。由于这种普遍掩饰转移了人们的视线，所以他们没有意识到，所有过着邪恶生活的人内心都只承认自然和人类谨慎。不过，只要思考一下他们这种承认的源头和原因，就能清楚看出，这就是这些人所承认的。为揭示这一点，我需要解释一下人自己的谨慎来自何处，它是什么；然后解释一下谁承认圣治，谁承认人自己的谨慎，以及他们各是何性质；最后说明那些承认圣治的人在天堂，那些承认人自己的谨慎之人在地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 205</h4><p>205. (6) People who have acknowledged only nature and only human prudence make up hell, while those who have acknowledged God and His Divine providence make up heaven. People who lead an evil life all inwardly acknowledge only nature and only human prudence. An acknowledgment of these lies hidden in every evil, however covered over it may be with goods and truths. These are simply borrowed clothing, or like garlands of little flowers that perish, wound around to keep the evil from appearing in its nakedness. <p>People do not know that those who lead an evil life all inwardly acknowledge only nature and only human prudence, and this because of that collective covering, for this hides it from view. But that they nevertheless acknowledge these can be seen from the origin and cause of their acknowledgment, which to be disclosed requires us to state the origin and nature of a person's own prudence, then the origin and nature of Divine providence; after that who the two kinds of people are and their character; and finally, that those who acknowledge Divine providence are in heaven, while those who acknowledge their own prudence are in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 205</h4><p>205. 6. People who have acknowledged only the physical world and human prudence constitute hell, while people who have acknowledged God and divine providence constitute heaven. All the people who lead evil lives inwardly recognize the material world and human prudence alone. This attitude is latent in all evil, no matter how well it is veiled by things that are good and true. These veils are nothing but clothes borrowed from a friend or garlands of flowers that fade, put on to hide evil in all its nakedness. <p>Because this common practice of concealment distracts our sight, people do not realize that everyone who is leading an evil life is inwardly recognizing the material world alone and human prudence alone. We can tell that this is what such people recognize if we know the source of this recognition and its reason. To uncover this, I need to explain where our own prudence comes from and what it is, then where divine providence comes from and what it is, then who the two kinds of people are and what they are like, and finally that people who acknowledge divine providence are in heaven and people who acknowledge human prudence are in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 205</h4><p>205. VI. THOSE WHO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED NATURE ALONE AND HUMAN PRUDENCE ALONE CONSTITUTE HELL; WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED GOD AND HIS DIVINE PROVIDENCE CONSTITUTE HEAVEN. All who lead an evil life interiorly acknowledge nature and human prudence alone; for this acknowledgment lies inwardly hidden in all evil however covered over it may be with good and truth. These are only borrowed garments, or like wreaths of flowerets that perish, thrown around the evil lest it should appear in its nakedness. It is not known that all who lead an evil life interiorly acknowledge nature and human prudence alone, because of this general covering by which it is hidden from view. However, that they do acknowledge them may be clear from the source and cause of their acknowledgment. In order that this may be made evident it shall be stated whence man's own prudence is and what it is; then whence the Divine Providence is and what it is; next who they are and what their nature is who acknowledge the Divine Providence, and who acknowledge man's own prudence; and lastly, that those who acknowledge the Divine Providence are in heaven, and those who acknowledge man's own prudence are in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 205</h4><p>205. (6) Those that have acknowledged nature alone and human prudence alone constitute hell; while those that have acknowledged God and His Divine providence constitute heaven. All who lead an evil life interiorly acknowledge nature and human prudence only; the acknowledgment of these is inwardly hidden in all evil, howsoever it may be covered over with goods and truths. These are only borrowed garments, or are like wreaths of perishable flowers, put on lest evil should appear in its nakedness. Because of this general covering it is not known that all who lead an evil life interiorly acknowledge nature alone and human prudence alone, for this is hidden from sight by the covering. But by considering the source and cause of their acknowledgment it can be made clear that it is such. To make this evident it shall be told whence man's own prudence is and what it is; and then whence the Divine providence is and what it is; also who and what those are of each class; and finally, that those who acknowledge the Divine providence are in heaven, and those who acknowledge their own prudence are in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 205 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>205. VI. Quod illi qui solam naturam et solam prudentiam humanam agnoverunt, faciant infernum, et qui Deum et Divinam Ipsius Providentiam agnoverunt, faciant coelum. Omnes qui malam vitam agunt, interius agnoscunt [solam] naturam, et solam prudentiam humanam; harum agnitio latet intus in omni malo, utcunque circumvelatur bonis et veris; haec sunt modo vestes mutuo petitae, aut sicut serta ex flosculis qui pereunt, circumposita ne malum in sua nuditate appareat. Quod omnes qui malam vitam agunt, interius agnoscant solam naturam et solam prudentiam humanam, ex communi illa circumvelatione non scitur, per illam enim hoc subducitur visui: at quod usque agnoscant, constare potest ex origine et causa agnitionis illarum, quae ut detegatur, dicetur, unde et quid Propria prudentia; deinde unde et quid Divina Providentia; postea, quinam et quales hi et illi sunt; et demum, quod qui Divinam Providentiam agnoscunt, in Coelo sint, et qui Propriam prudentiam in inferno. </p>
