<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>242、②他们的长子该隐杀死了他的兄弟亚伯，神当时没有向他发话阻止，仅在事后诅咒他。由于亚当和他的妻子表示上古教会，如前所述，所以他们头两个儿子，即该隐和亚伯，表示上古教会的两个基本要素，就是爱和智慧，或仁和信。“亚伯”表示爱和仁，“该隐”表示智慧或信，严格来说，表示与爱分离的智慧，或与仁分离的信。当信被如此分离时，智慧不仅倾向于弃绝爱和仁，还倾向于摧毁它们，从而杀死自己的兄弟。在基督教界，众所周知，这就是与仁分离之信所做的事，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之信篇》。<p>对该隐的诅咒涉及那些将信与仁分离，或将智慧与爱分离的人死后所进入的属灵状态。然而，为防止智慧或信灭亡，耶和华在该隐身上立了一个记号，免得有人杀他（创世记4:15）。这是因为爱离了智慧无法存在，或仁离了信无法存在。这些事的含义和从知识树吃东西的含义非常相似；这就是为何经上在描述了亚当和他的妻子之后，接着就描述了这些事。此外，那些将信与仁分离的人被包裹在自己的聪明中；而那些由于仁而拥有信的人从主拥有聪明的恩赐，从而处于圣治之中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 242</h4><p>242. (2) That their first son, Cain, killed his brother Abel, and God did not deter him at the time by speaking to him, but only after the deed by cursing him: Since by Adam and his wife is meant the Most Ancient Church, as just said above, therefore by Cain and Abel, their first sons, are meant the two essentials of the church, which are love and wisdom or charity and faith - by Abel love and charity, and by Cain wisdom or faith, specifically wisdom divorced from love, or faith divorced from charity. And wisdom or faith thus divorced is such that it not only rejects love and charity, but also destroys them, and so kills its brother. It is well known in the Christian world that this is what faith divorced from charity does. (See The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding Faith.)</p><p>[2] The curse on Cain has to do with their spiritual state, the state into which those people come after death who separate faith from charity, or wisdom from love. <p>But still, to keep wisdom or faith from therefore perishing, a mark was placed on Cain to prevent his being killed. For love does not exist apart from wisdom, nor charity apart from faith. <p>Because almost the same thing is represented by this account as by eating of the tree of knowledge, it follows therefore in sequence after the description of Adam and his wife. People who are governed by a faith divorced from charity are governed by their own intelligence, while people who are governed by charity, and for that reason by faith, are governed by an intelligence from the Lord, thus by Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 242</h4><p>242. 2. Their first son, Cain, killed his brother Abel, and God did not dissuade him by talking with him beforehand, but simply cursed him after the fact. Since Adam and his wife mean the earliest church, as just noted [<a href="241.htm">241</a>], Cain and Abel as their first sons mean the two essential qualities of that church, love and wisdom, or charity and faith. Abel means love and charity, and Cain means wisdom or faith, particularly wisdom separated from love or faith separated from charity. When faith has been separated, wisdom tends not only to reject love and charity but to destroy them, killing its own brother. <p>It is reasonably well known in Christian circles that this is what faith does when it is separated from charity--see Teachings for the New Jerusalem on Faith.</p><p>[2] The curse of Cain is about the spiritual state that people who separate faith from charity, or wisdom from love, arrive at after death. However, in order to prevent the death of wisdom or faith, a mark is placed on Cain so that no one will kill him [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_4_15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>]. This is because love cannot exist without wisdom, or charity without faith. <p>Since the meaning of this is very much like the meaning of eating from the tree of knowledge, it follows right after the description of Adam and his wife. People who have separated faith from charity are wrapped up in their own intelligence; while people who have faith because of their caring have a gift of intelligence from the Lord and are in sympathy with divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 242</h4><p>242. 2. Their first son, Cain killed his brother Abel, and God did not withhold him at the time by speaking to him, but only after the deed cursed him. Since by Adam and his wife is meant the Most Ancient Church, as has just been said above, so by Cain and Abel their first sons, are meant the two essentials of the Church, which are love and wisdom, or charity and faith. By Abel is meant love and charity and by Cain wisdom or faith, in particular, wisdom separated from love, or faith separated from charity; and wisdom as well as faith when separated is such that it not only rejects love and charity, but even destroys them and thus kills its own brother. That faith separate from charity does this is well known in the Christian world, as may be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING FAITH.</p><p>[2] The curse of Cain involves the spiritual state into which those come after death who separate faith from charity or wisdom from love. Yet in order that wisdom or faith might not therefore perish, a mark was set upon Cain lest he should be slain, for love cannot exist without wisdom, nor can charity without faith. As almost the same thing is represented by these things as by the eating of the tree of knowledge, therefore this story comes next in order after the description of Adam and his wife. Moreover, those who are in faith separated from charity are in their own intelligence; while those who are in charity and consequently in faith are in intelligence from the Lord, and thus in the Divine Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 242</h4><p>242. (2) Their first son Cain killed his brother Abel, and God did not withhold him at the time by speaking with him, but only after the deed, by cursing him. As Adam and his wife, as has been said above, mean the Most Ancient Church, so Cain and Abel, their first sons, mean the two essentials of the church, which are love and wisdom, or charity and faith, "Abel" meaning love and charity, and "Cain" wisdom or faith; strictly, wisdom separated from love, or faith separated from charity; and wisdom as well as faith when so separated is such that it not only rejects love and charity, but even annihilates them; and thus it kills its brother. That faith separate from charity does this is well known in the Christian world, as may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, concerning Faith.</p><p> [2] The cursing of Cain involves the spiritual state into which those come after death who separate faith from charity or wisdom from love. And yet, that wisdom or faith might not perish in consequence, a mark was put upon Cain to prevent his being slain; for love cannot exist apart from wisdom, or charity apart from faith. These things have nearly the same representation as the eating from the tree of knowledge; and this is why it properly follows the description of Adam and his wife. Moreover, those who are in faith separated from charity are in their own intelligence; while those who are in charity and in faith therefrom are in intelligence from the Lord, thus in the Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 242 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>242. II. Quod primus eorum filius, Cainus, occiderit fratrem suum Abelem, et Deus non tunc abduxerit loquendo cum illo, sed modo post factum maledicendo. Quoniam per Adamum et uxorem ejus intelligitur Ecclesia antiquissima, ut nunc supra dictum est, inde per Cainum et Abelem, primos eorum filios, intelliguntur duo essentialia Ecclesiae, quae sunt Amor et Sapientia, seu Charitas et Fides, per Abelem amor et charitas, et per Cainum sapientia seu fides, in specie sapientia separata ab amore, seu fides separata a charitate; et sapientia tum fides separata talis est, ut non modo rejiciat amorem et charitatem, sed etiam illas annihilet, et sic fratrem suum occidat: quod fides separata a charitate ita faciat, in Christiano Orbe satis notum est; videatur DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE FIDE.</p><p>[2] Maledictio Caini involvit statum illorum spiritualem, in quem post mortem veniunt, qui separant fidem a charitate, seu sapientiam ab amore. Sed usque ne ideo pereat sapientia seu fides, positum est signum super Caino, ne occideretur, nam amor non datur absque sapientia, nec charitas absque fide. Quia per haec paene simile repraesentatum est, quod per esum ex arbore scientiae, ideo sequitur hoc in ordine post descriptionem Adami et ejus uxoris; illi etiam qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, in propria intelligentia sunt, et qui in charitate et inde fide, in intelligentia a Domino sunt, ita in Divina Providentia. </p>
