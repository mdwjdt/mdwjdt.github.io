<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第107节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>107、这种统治的形式可通过对比在某种程度上看出来。天堂之爱及其对良善和真理的情感并由此而来的感知，连同这些情感的快乐和由此而来的思维，好比分为枝、叶、果的一棵树。生命之爱是这棵树，枝和叶是对良善和真理的情感及其感知；果是情感的快乐及其思维。而地狱之爱及其对邪恶和虚假的情感，也就是欲望，连同这些欲望的快乐和由此而来的思维，好比一个蜘蛛及其周围的网。这爱本身是蜘蛛，对邪恶和虚假的欲望及其内在狡诈是最靠近蜘蛛巢穴的蛛网；这些欲望的快乐及其诡计是远处的蛛网，苍蝇便在此被粘住翅膀，被缠住并吃掉。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 107</h4><p>107. The form of this government may be seen to some extent through comparisons. <p>Heavenly love with its affections for good and truth and consequent perceptions, together with the delights of those affections and their consequent thoughts, may be likened to a tree adorned with branches, leaves and fruits. The life's love is the tree itself. The branches with their leaves are affections for good and truth with their accompanying perceptions; and the fruits are the delights of the affections with their accompanying thoughts. <p>In contrast, hellish love with its affections for evil and falsity, which are lusts, together with the delights of those lusts and their accompanying thoughts, may be likened to a spider and its surrounding web. The love itself is the spider. Its lusts for evil and falsity with their interior cunning and guile are the threads of the web immediately surrounding the spider's abode, and the delights of those lusts with their crafty schemes are the threads further out, where flies flitting about are caught, wrapped up, and devoured. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 107</h4><p>107. We can see what this governmental structure is like to some extent from comparisons. <p>As for heavenly love with its desires for what is good and true and the perceptions they prompt--the pleasures of those desires and the thoughts that the pleasures prompt--these can be compared to a tree with all its branches, leaves, and fruit. The life's love is the tree; the branches and leaves are the desires for what is good and true and their perceptions; and the fruit is the pleasures of those desires and their thoughts. <p>As for hellish love, though, with its desires for what is evil and false, its compulsions, and the pleasures of those compulsions and the thoughts that they prompt, they can be compared to a spider in the middle of its web. The love itself is the spider; the cravings for what is evil and false and their deeper deceptions are the web of threads right where the spider sits; and the pleasures of those compulsions with their vicious schemes are the outer threads where flying insects are caught, wrapped up, and eaten. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 107</h4><p>107. The form of this rule may in some measure be seen by comparisons. Heavenly love and its affections of good and truth and their consequent perceptions, together with the delights of these affections and their consequent thoughts, may be compared to a tree distinguished for its branches, leaves and fruits. The life's love is the tree, the branches with their leaves are the affections of good and truth with their perceptions, and the fruits are the delights of the affections with their thoughts. On the other hand, infernal love with its affections of evil and falsity which are lusts, together with the delights of these lusts and their consequent thoughts may be compared to a spider and its surrounding web. The love is the spider, the lusts of evil and falsity with their inner subtleties are the net-like threads nearest the den of the spider; and the delights of these lusts with their crafty devices are the remoter threads, where flies are caught on the wing, entangled and eaten. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 107</h4><p>107. The form of this rule can in some measure be seen by comparisons. Heavenly love with its affections for good and truth and perceptions therefrom, together with its enjoyments from these affections and thoughts therefrom, may be likened to a tree distinguished for its branches, leaves, and fruits. The life's love is the tree; the branches with the leaves are affections for good and truth with their perceptions; and the fruits are the enjoyments of affections with their thoughts. But infernal love with its affections for evil and falsity, which are lusts, together with the enjoyment of these lusts and thoughts therefrom, may be likened to a spider with its surrounding web. The love itself is the spider, the lusts of evil and falsity with their interior subtleties are the net-like threads nearest the spider's seat; and the enjoyments of these lusts with their deceitful devices are the remoter threads, where the flies are caught on the wing, and are ensnared and eaten. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 107 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>107. Forma hujus regiminis potest aliquatenus per comparationes videri: Amor coelestis cum affectionibus boni et veri, et inde perceptionibus, et simul cum jucundis affectionum illarum et inde cogitationibus, comparari potest Arbori insigni ramis, foliis et fructibus; amor vitae est arbor illa, rami cum foliis sunt affectiones boni et veri cum illarum perceptionibus, ac fructus sunt jucunda affectionum cum illorum cogitationibus. At Amor infernalis cum ejus affectionibus mali et falsi, quae sunt concupiscentiae, et simul cum jucundis concupiscentiarum illarum et inde cogitationibus, comparari potest araneae et ejus telae circumtextae; ipse amor est aranea, concupiscentiae mali et falsi cum illarum interioribus astutiis, sunt fila retiformia araneae sedi proxima, <sup>1</sup>ac jucunda concupiscentiarum illarum cum machinationibus dolosis sunt fila remotiora, ubi volantes muscae captantur, circumvelantur et comeduntur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: proxima; </p>
