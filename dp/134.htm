<h4 align="center"></h4><p>134a.⑵没有人能因异象或与死者交谈被改造，因为它们强迫人。异象有两种，即神性异象和魔鬼异象。神性异象是通过天堂里的代表产生的，魔鬼异象是通过地狱中的巫术产生的。还有幻想的异象，这类异象是一种迷失方向的心智所产生的幻觉。刚才所说的通过天堂里的代表所产生的神性异象是发生在先知身上的那种。当在这些异象中时，他们不是在肉身中，而是在灵里，因为异象不可能发生在处于肉身清醒状态下的任何人身上。因此，当先知看见异象时，经上说他们“在灵里”，这从以下经文明显可知。以西结说：<p>灵将我举起，在异象中借着神的灵，将我带进迦勒底地，到被掳的人那里，我所见的异象就离我上升去了。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">（以西结书11:1</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24）</a><p>以西结书：<p>灵就将我举到天地中间，在神的异象中，带我到耶路撒冷。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">（以西结书8:3ff）</a><p>他在看见四活物，也就是基路伯时，同样在神的异象中，或在灵里（以西结书1和10章）；当他看见新殿和新地，并且天使量它们时也是（以西结书40到48章）；经上说，当时他在神的异象中<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">（以西结书40:2</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_26.htm">26）</a>，在灵里<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">（以西结书43:5）</a>。<p>撒迦利亚处于同样的状态，当时他看见一人骑马在番石榴树中间<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">（撒迦利亚书1:8ff）</a>；他看见四角<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">（撒迦利亚书1:18）</a>；一个人手拿准绳<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">（撒迦利亚书2:1-3ff）</a>；他看见一个烛台和两棵橄榄树<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">（撒迦利亚书4:1ff）</a>；他看见飞行的书卷和量器<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">（撒迦利亚书5:1，6）</a>；他看见四辆车从两座山中间出来，还有马<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">（撒迦利亚书6:1ff）</a>。但以理同样处于这种状态，当时他看见有四个大兽从海中上来<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">（但以理书7:1ff）</a>；他看见公绵羊和公山羊之间的战斗<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">（但以理书8:1ff）</a>；经上说，他是在灵的异象中看见这些东西的<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">（但以理书7:1-2</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8）</a>；他在异象中看见天使加百列<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_21.htm">（但以理书9:21）</a>。<p>当约翰看见他在启示录中所描述的东西时，他也在灵的异象中；那时，他看见：<p>七个灯台，七灯台中间的人子。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_12.htm">（启示录1:12-16）</a><p>天上的宝座，坐在宝座上的那一位；四活物，就是宝座周围的基路伯。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_1.htm">（启示录4章）</a><p>羔羊所拿的生命册。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">（启示录5章）</a><p>从书卷里出来的马。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">（启示录6章）</a><p>拿号的七位天使。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_1.htm">（启示录8章）</a><p>开了的无底坑，从坑中出来的蝗虫。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_1.htm">（启示录9章）</a><p>龙，它与米迦勒的争战。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">（启示录12章）</a><p>两个兽，一个从海中上来，一个从地中上来。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">（启示录13章）</a><p>一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_1.htm">（启示录17章）</a><p>被毁灭的巴比伦。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_1.htm">（启示录18章）</a><p>一匹白马，骑在马上的。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_1.htm">（启示录19章）</a><p>一个新天新地；圣耶路撒冷从天而降。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">（启示录21章）</a><p>生命水的河。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">（启示录22章）</a><p>经上说，他在灵的异象中看见这些东西<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_10.htm">（启示录1:10</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1-2）</a>。这些就是从天堂呈现给他们灵的视觉，而非他们肉体视觉的那种异象。像这样的异象如今不会发生了；即便发生，它们也不被人理解，因为它们是通过代表产生的，其每个细节都象征教会的内在事物和天堂的奥秘。此外，但以理<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_11_24.htm">（但以理书9:24）</a>预言，当主降世时，它们就会停止。但魔鬼的异象有时会出现，它们是由狂热的幻想灵引发的；这些灵人由于吞噬他们的精神错乱而自称圣灵。然而，如今主把这些灵人聚集起来，投入与其它地狱分离的一个地狱中。这一切清楚表明，除了圣言中的异象外，没有人能因其它任何异象被改造。还有幻想的异象，但这些异象纯粹是一种迷失方向的心智所产生的幻觉。<p>134b.没有人因与死者交谈被改造，这一点从主所讲的阴间里的财主和亚伯拉罕怀中的拉撒路的故事明显看出来；因为财主说：<p>我祖亚伯拉罕啊，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。亚伯拉罕对他说，他们有摩西和先知，让他们听他们吧。他说，我祖亚伯拉罕哪，不是的，若有一个从死里到他们那里去的，他们必要悔改。亚伯拉罕回答他，若不听从摩西和先知，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">（路加福音16:27-31）</a><p>与死者交谈的效果和刚才所说的神迹是一样的，也就是说：人短时间内会被说服并强迫进入敬拜的状态。然而，由于这会剥夺人的理性，同时邪恶被压抑，如前所述（130-131，133节），所以这种符咒或内在约束会松开，被压抑的邪恶以侮慢和亵渎爆发出来。但只有当灵人强加某种宗教信条时，这种情况才会发生。善灵从来不做这种事，更不用说天使了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 134</h4><p>134. (2) No one is reformed by visions or by communications with the dead, because they compel. Visions are of two kinds: Divine and diabolic. Divine visions are produced by representative appearances in heaven, while diabolic visions are produced by magical arts in hell. There are in addition hallucinatory visions, which are the delusions of a distraught mind. <p>Divine visions - those produced, as we said, by representative appearances in heaven - are the kind the prophets had, who, when having them, were not conscious in the body but in the spirit. For visions cannot appear to any person in his body's conscious state. Consequently when the prophets saw visions, they also said that they were then in the spirit, as is apparent from the following instances. Ezekiel says: <p>The Spirit lifted me up... and brought me back into Chaldea, to the captives, in a vision (of God), by the Spirit of God. (Thus) went up from me the vision that I had seen. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>) <p>So, too, he says that the Spirit lifted him up between earth and heaven, and brought him in visions of God to Jerusalem (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>f.). He was likewise in a vision of God or in the spirit when he saw the four living creatures, which were cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>), as also when he saw a new temple and a new earth, and an angel measuring them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>-48). That he was then in the visions of God, he himself says (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), and that he was in the spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>).</p><p>[2] Zechariah was in a like state when he saw a man riding a horse among the myrtle trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>ff.); when he saw the four horns, and a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>ff.); when he saw the lampstand and two olive trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>ff.); when he saw the flying scroll and the ephah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); when he saw the four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>ff.). <p>In a like state was Daniel when he saw the four beasts coming up from the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>ff.), and when he saw the combat between the ram and the male goat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>ff.). We are told that he saw these things in the vision of his spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>), and that the angel Gabriel appeared to him in a vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).</p><p>[3] John, too, was in the vision of the spirit when he saw the things that he described in the book of Revelation. For example, when he saw the seven lampstands and in the midst of them the Son of Man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12-16</a>); when he saw the throne in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne, and around it the four living creatures, which were cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_1.htm">Revelation 4</a>); when he saw the book of life taken by the Lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">Revelation 5</a>); when he saw the horses going out from the book (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">Revelation 6</a>); when he saw the seven angels with trumpets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_1.htm">Revelation 8</a>); when he saw the pit of the abyss opened, and the locusts coming out of it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_1.htm">Revelation 9</a>); when he saw the dragon and its battle with Michael (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12</a>); when he saw the two beasts rising up, one from the sea, the other from the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13</a>); when he saw the woman sitting on the scarlet beast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_1.htm">Revelation 17</a>), and Babylon destroyed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_1.htm">Revelation 18</a>); when he saw the white horse, and the one sitting on it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_1.htm">Revelation 19</a>); when he saw the new heaven and the new earth, and the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>); and when he saw the river of the water of life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22</a>). We are told that he saw these things in the vision of the spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_17.htm">9:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_10.htm">21:10</a>).</p><p>[4] Of such a nature were the visions that appeared from heaven, to the sight of their spirit, and not to their bodily sight. Visions of this kind do not occur today, for if they were to occur they would not be understood, because they are produced by representative appearances, every one of which symbolizes internal things connected with the church and secrets pertaining to heaven. Daniel also foretold that visions would cease when the Lord came into the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>). <p>On the other hand, diabolic visions do sometimes occur, induced by fanatic and visionary spirits, who, owing to the madness that grips them, call themselves the Holy Spirit. But these spirits have now been gathered by the Lord and cast down into a hell set apart from the hells of others. <p>It is apparent from this that no one can be reformed by any visions other than those in the Word. <p>There are also hallucinatory visions, but they are are simply the delusions of a distraught mind. <p>134 [repeated]. As for the statement that no one is reformed by communications with the dead, either, this follows from the Lord's words regarding the rich man in hell and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom. For the rich man said: <p>"I beg you... , father (Abraham), that you would send (Lazarus) to my father's house, for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment." Abraham said to him, "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." But he said, "No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent." But he (replied) to him, "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one should rise from the dead." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">Luke 16:27-31</a>) <p>Communication with the dead would produce the same effect as miracles, as discussed just above, namely that a person would be persuaded and forced into worship for a short time. But because this divests a person of his rationality, and at the same time shuts in his evils, as we said above, the internal spell or bond is broken, and the imprisoned evils burst forth, accompanied by blasphemy and profanation. But this occurs only when spirits inject some dogma of religion, which is never done by any good spirit, still less by any angel of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 134</h4><p>134a. 2. No one is reformed by visions or by conversations with the dead, because they compel. There are two kinds of visions, divine and demonic. Divine visions are given by means of portrayals in heaven, while demonic visions are effected though magical events in hell. There are imaginary visions as well, visions that are the illusions of a mind that has lost its bearings. <p>Divine visions (which as just noted are given by means of portrayals in heaven) are the kind that happened to the prophets. When they were having these visions they were not in the body but in the spirit, because visions cannot happen to us while we are physically awake. So when the prophets saw visions, it says that they were in the spirit, as the following passages show. <p>Ezekiel said, "The spirit lifted me up and took me back to Chaldea to the captivity in a vision of God, in the spirit of God; so the vision that I saw came over me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>). Then too, spirits held him up between earth and heaven and brought him to Jerusalem in visions of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> and following).

It was foretold in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a> that they would stop when the Lord came into the world. <p>However, demonic visions have sometimes occurred. They are brought about by spirits who inspire deceptive passions and visions and who call themselves the Holy Spirit because of a mental confusion that engulfs them. Now, however, these spirits have been gathered in by the Lord and consigned to a hell separate from the other hells. <p>We can see from all this that no one can be reformed by any visions except the ones that are in the Word. There are imaginary visions as well, but these are nothing but the illusions of a mind that has lost its bearings. <p>134b. The story that the Lord told about the rich man in hell and Lazarus in Abraham's lap shows that no one is reformed by conversations with the dead. The rich man said, "Father Abraham, I beg you to send Lazarus to my father's house where I have five brothers, to bear witness to them so that they do not come to this place of torment." Abraham said to him, "They have Moses and the prophets: let them heed them." But he said, "No, father Abraham, but if someone came to them from the dead, they would repent." He answered him, "If they do not heed Moses and the prophets, they would not be convinced if someone rose from the dead" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">Luke 16:27-31</a>). <p>Conversations with the dead may lead to the same results as miracles that I have just described. That is, we may be convinced and be constrained to worship for a short while. However, since this deprives us of rational functioning at the same time that it hems in our evils, as already noted [<a href="130.htm">130-131</a>, <a href="133.htm">133</a>], this spell or inner restraint is released and the pent-up evils erupt in blasphemy and profanation. Still, this happens only when spirits have imposed some religious dogma. No good spirit--let alone any angel of heaven--would ever do this. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 134</h4><p>134. II. NO ONE IS REFORMED BY VISIONS AND BY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEAD, BECAUSE THEY COMPEL. Visions are of two kinds, Divine and diabolical. Divine visions are produced by means of representatives in heaven, and diabolical visions by means of magic in hell. There are also fantastic visions, which are the delusions of a distracted mind. Divine visions, which as has been said, are produced by representatives in heaven, are such as the prophets had, who were not in the body but in the spirit when they were in them; for visions cannot appear to anyone in a state of bodily wakefulness. When, therefore, they appeared to the prophets it is said also that they were then in the spirit, as is evident from the following passages:<p>Ezekiel says: The spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision (of God), in the Spirit of God, into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">11:24</a>).<p>Again: That the spirit lifted him up between the earth and the heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3-4</a>).<p>In like manner he was in a vision of God or in the spirit when he saw four living creatures, which were cherubim, (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>). As also when he saw the new temple and the new earth, and the angel measuring them, (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>-<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>).<p>He says: That he was then in the visions of God, (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_26.htm">40:26</a>).<p>And, That he was in the spirit, (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>).</p><p>[2] Zechariah was in a similar state,<p>When he saw a man riding among the myrtle trees. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>.<p>When he saw the four horns, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>;<p>and a man in whose hand was a measuring line, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-3</a>.<p>When he saw a candlestick and two olive trees, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>.<p>When he saw a flying roll and an ephah, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1-6</a>.<p>When he saw four chariots coming out from between four (A.V. two) mountains and horses, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>.<p>Daniel was in a similar state,<p>When he saw four beasts coming up from the sea. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a><p>And when he saw the combat between the ram and the he-goat, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>.<p>That he saw these things in a vision of his spirit is stated, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">10:7-8</a>.

Such visions do not appear at the present day; for if they did they would not be understood, because they are produced by means of representatives, the particulars of which signify internal things of the Church and spiritual truths of heaven. It is also foretold by <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_11_24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>, (A.V. Daniel 9) , that these visions would cease when the Lord came into the world. However, infernal visions have sometimes appeared, induced by fanatical and visionary spirits who, from the madness which possessed them, called themselves the Holy Spirit. But these spirits have now been gathered together by the Lord and cast into a hell separate from the hells of others. From these things it is clear that no one can be reformed by any other visions than those which are recorded in the Word. There are also fantastic visions, but these are mere illusions of a distracted mind.<p>134a. <sup>1</sup>That no one is reformed by conversations with the dead is evident from the words of the Lord concerning the rich man in hell and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom; for the rich man said:<p>I pray thee father Abraham, that thou wouldest send Lazarus (A.V. him) to my father's house:<p>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. Abraham saith unto him: They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.<p>And he said: Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<p>And he said unto him: If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">Luke 16:27-31</a>.<p>Conversation with the dead would have the same effect as miracles, about which something has just been said above, namely, that a man might indeed be persuaded and driven to worship for a short time. But as this deprives him of rationality and at the same time shuts in his evils, as was said above, this spell or internal restraint is loosed, and the evils that have been shut in break out with blasphemy and profanation. This happens, however, only when spirits induce upon the mind some religious dogma; and this is never done by any good spirit, still less by any angel of heaven.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This section is numbered "134" in the Original Edition. </p>

Moreover, it was foretold by Daniel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>) that they would cease when the Lord came into the world. But diabolical visions have sometimes appeared, induced by enthusiastic and visionary spirits, who from the delirium that possessed them called themselves the Holy Spirit. But these spirits have now been gathered up by the Lord and cast into a hell separate from the hells of others. All this makes clear that by no other visions than those in the Word can one be reformed. There are also fantastic visions: but these are mere delusions of an abstracted mind <p>134b. That no one is reformed by conversations with the dead is evident from the Lord's words respecting the rich man in hell and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom; for the rich man said:- <p>I pray thee, father Abraham, that thou wouldst send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brethren, that he may testify unto them, lest they also come unto this place of torment. Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them. But he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one come to them from the dead they will repent. He answered him, If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rise from the dead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">Luke 16:27-31</a>). <p>Conversation with the dead would have the same effect as miracles, of which just above, namely, man would be persuaded and forced into a state of worship for a short time. But as man is thus deprived of rationality, and at the same time evils are shut in, as said above, this spell or internal bond is loosed, and the evils that have been shut in break out, with blasphemy and profanation. But this takes place only when some dogma of religion has been imposed upon the mind by spirits, which is never done by any good spirit, still less by any angel of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 134 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>134. II. Quod nemo reformetur per visiones et per loquelas cum defunctis, quia cogunt. Visiones sunt duplicis generis, Divinae et diabolicae: Visiones Divinae fiunt per repraesentativa in Coelo; ac Visiones diabolicae fiunt per magica in inferno: sunt etiam visiones phantasticae, quae sunt ludificationes mentis abstractae. Visiones Divinae, quae, ut dictum est, fiunt per repraesentativa <sup>1</sup>in Coelo, sunt quales fuerunt Prophetis, <sup>2</sup>qui, cum in illis erant, non erant in corpore, sed in spiritu; nam visiones non possunt apparere alicui homini in vigilia corporis sui; quare cum apparuerunt prophetis, dicitur etiam quod tunc fuerint in spiritu; ut patet a sequentibus his, "Ezechiel dicit, Spiritus sustulit me, et reduxit me in Chaldaeam ad captivitatem in VISIONE DEI, in SPIRITU DEI; ita ascendit super me VISIO quam vidi," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_11_1">11:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_11_24">24</a>: Tum, quod sustulerit <sup>3</sup>illum Spiritus inter terram et coelum, et abduxerit in Hierosolymam in VISIONIBUS DEI, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_8_3">8:3</a>, seq.: similiter fuit in visione Dei seu spiritu, cum vidit quatuor <sup>4</sup>animalia, quae erant Cherubi, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_1-28">1</a> et Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_1-22">10</a>: ut et, cum vidit novum Templum et novam Terram, et Angelum metientem illa, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_40_1-49">40</a> ad <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_48_1-35">48</a>; quod tunc fuerit in Visionibus Dei, dicit, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_40_2">40:2</a>: <sup>5</sup>et quod in Spiritu, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_43_5">43:5</a>.</p><p>[2] In simili statu fuit Sacharias, cum vidit virum equitantem inter myrtos, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_1_8">1:8</a>, seq.: Cum vidit quatuor <sup>6</sup>cornua, et virum in cujus manu funiculus mensurae, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_2_1">2:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_2_3">3</a>, seq.: <sup>7</sup>Cum vidit Candelabrum et duas oleas, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_4_1">4:1</a>, seq.: Cum vidit volumen volans, et epham, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_5_1">5:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_134/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_5_6">6</a>.
