<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第55节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>55、⑶圣治在它所做的一切事，尤其在拯救人类上，都关注来自它自身的无限和永恒之物。无限和永恒本身就是神性本身，或主本身，而来自它自身的无限和永恒是神性发出，也就是在由祂自己所创造的其他人，因而在世人和天使里面的主；这神性与圣治是一样的。因为主通过来自祂自己的神性规定，一切事物都要保持在它们被造所在并进入的秩序中。由于这是神性发出的工作，故可知，这一切都是圣治。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 55</h4><p>55. (3) In everything that it does, Divine providence regards something infinite and eternal from itself, especially in saving humankind. The infinite and eternal in itself is the Divine itself or the Lord in Himself. However, the infinite and eternal from itself is the emanating Divinity or Lord in others created from Him, thus in people and angels; and this Divinity is the same as Divine providence. For by the Divinity emanating from Him the Lord provides that all things be kept in the order in which and into which they were created. And because the emanating Divinity accomplishes this, it follows that the whole of it is Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 55</h4><p>55. 3. In everything it does, divine providence focuses on what is infinite and eternal from itself, especially in the intent to save the human race. What is intrinsically infinite and eternal is Divinity itself or the essential Lord. What is secondarily infinite and eternal, though, is divinity emanating, or the Lord in others created from himself--in us and in angels, that is. This divinity is the same as divine providence because the Lord provides by means of that derivative divinity that everything be kept in the design in which and into which it was created. Since it is emanating divinity that is accomplishing this, it follows that all of it is divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 55</h4><p>55. III. THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE IN EVERYTHING IT DOES REGARDS WHAT IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL FROM ITSELF, ESPECIALLY IN SAVING THE HUMAN RACE. The Infinite and Eternal in itself is the Divine itself or the Lord in Himself; but the Infinite and Eternal from itself is the Divine Proceeding, that is, the Lord in others created from Himself thus in men and in angels; and this Divine is the same as the Divine Providence. For by means of the Divine from Himself the Lord provides that all things may be held together in the order in which and into which they were created; and because this is the work of the Divine Proceeding it follows that all this is the Divine Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 55</h4><p>55. (3) The Divine providence, in all that it does, looks to what is infinite and eternal from itself, especially in saving the human race. The Infinite and Eternal in itself is the Divine itself, or the Lord in Himself, while the Infinite and Eternal from itself is the Divine going forth, that is, the Lord in others created from Himself, thus in men and in angels; and this Divine is the same as the Divine providence. For by means of the Divine from Himself the Lord provides that all things may be held together in the order in which and into which they were created. And as this is the work of the Divine that goes forth, it follows that all this is the Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 55 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>55. III. Quod Divina Providentia in omni quod facit, spectet infinitum ac aeternum a se, imprimis in <sup>1</sup>salvando Genere Humano. Infinitum ac Aeternum in se est ipsum Divinum seu Dominus in Se; <sup>2</sup>at Infinitum ac Aeternum a se, est Divinum procedens seu Dominus in aliis ex Se <sup>3</sup>creatis, ita in hominibus et in angelis, et hoc Divinum est idem cum Divina Providentia; nam Dominus per Divinum a Se <sup>4</sup>providet, ut omnia in ordine, in quo et in quem creata sunt, contineantur: et quia Divinum procedens hoc operatur, sequitur quod omne id sit Divina Providentia.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: iu<p>2 Prima editio: se;<p>3 Prima editio: se<p>4 Prima editio: se </p>
