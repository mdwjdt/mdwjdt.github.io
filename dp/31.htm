<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第31节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>31、由此可见，主就是天堂，该天堂不仅总体上在那里的所有天使里面，还具体地在那里的每位天使里面。因为每位天使都是一个最小形式的天堂；总体上的天堂是由和那里的天使一样多的天堂组成的。这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书<a href="../hh/51.htm">（51-58节）</a>。既然如此，那么就不要让人持守首先进入许多人思维的这一错误观念了：主在天堂住在天使当中，或与他们同住，就像一个国王住在自己的王国一样。就天使的视觉而言，主在他们之上，在那里的太阳中；但就其爱与智慧的生命而言，主就在他们里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 31</h4><p>31. It can be seen from this that the Lord is heaven, not only heaven in general among all who are in heaven, but also heaven in particular in each individual there. For every angel is a heaven in miniature form. Heaven in general consists of as many heavens as there are angels. The fact of this may be seen in the book <a href="../hh/51.htm">Heaven and Hell 51-58</a>. <p>This being the case, let no one cherish the erroneous idea - which for many enters their first thought - that the Lord dwells among the angels in heaven, or that He exists among them as a king does in his kingdom. He is to their sight above them in the sun there, but in them as regards their life of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 31</h4><p>31. We can therefore tell that the Lord is heaven not only in a general way (for all who are there), but also specifically (for every individual who is there). An angel is actually a heaven in smallest form; and heaven in general is made up of as many heavens as there are angels. (On this point, see <a href="../hh/51.htm">Heaven and Hell 51-58</a>.) <p>Given this fact, no one should become attached to the mistaken notion that the Lord lives among the angels in heaven or dwells with them the way a monarch dwells in a realm--an idea that crosses many minds when they first think about the matter. Visually, the Lord is above them there like a sun; though as far as the life of their love and wisdom is concerned, he is within them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 31</h4><p>31. Hence it may be evident that the Lord is heaven not only in general with all there, but also in particular with every individual there. For every angel is a heaven in its least form, and from these heavens, which are as many as there are angels, heaven in general is constituted. That this is the case may be seen in the work HEAVEN AND HELL (n. <a href="../hh/51.htm">51-58</a>). This being so, let no one cherish the erroneous idea that first enters the thought of many that the Lord is present in heaven among the angels, or that He is with them like a king in his kingdom. In respect to their sight He is above them in the Sun there, but in respect to their life of love and wisdom He is in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 31</h4><p>31. From all this it can be seen that the Lord is heaven not only in general in all there, but also in particular in each one there. For each angel is a heaven in the least form; and heaven in general consists of as many heavens as there are angels. This can be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (<a href="../hh/51.htm">Heaven and Hell 51-58</a>). This being so, let no one cherish the mistaken idea that enters into the first thought of many, that the Lord dwells among the angels in heaven, or is with them like a king in his kingdom. In respect to their sight He is above them in the sun there; but in respect to the life of their love and wisdom He is in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 31 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>31. Ex his constare potest, quod Dominus sit Coelum, non modo in communi apud omnes ibi, sed etiam in particulari apud unumquemvis ibi; est enim quisque angelus coelum in minima forma; ex tot coelis quot sunt angeli, est coelum in communi; quod ita sit, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_31/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_51">de COELO ET INFERNO 51-58</a>. Quoniam ita est, ne aliquis foveat erroneum id, quod apud multos cadit in cogitationem primam, quod Dominus sit in Coelo inter angelos, aut quod sit apud illos sicut Rex est in suo Regno; est supra illos quoad aspectum in Sole ibi, sed quoad vitam amoris et sapientiae illorum in illis. </p>
