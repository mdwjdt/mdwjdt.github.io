<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第163节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>163、我需要用几句话来说明主如何从天使天堂引领并教导每个人。在《圣爱与圣智》，本书《圣治》的前文，以及1758年出版于伦敦的《天堂与地狱》，我已经根据我的所见所闻让人们知道：整个天使天堂在主面前显为一个人，每个天堂社群也是如此。这就是为何每位天使和每个灵人都是一个完整形式的人。在这些著作中，我还说明，天堂之为天堂，不是因为属于天使的任何东西，而是因为他们对来自主的神性之爱和智慧的接受。由此可见，主掌管整个天使天堂，就好像它是一个人，并且这个天堂正是主的形像和样式，因为它本身就是一个人。我还说明，主亲自掌管这个天堂，就像灵魂掌管它的身体；主因掌管整个人类，故不是通过天堂，而是从天堂，因而从祂自己掌管人类，因为主就是天堂，如前所述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 163</h4><p>163. But we must briefly say how the Lord leads and teaches every person from the angelic heaven. In our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, and above in the present treatise Divine Providence, as also in the book Heaven and Hell, published in 1758 in London, we have reported from things we have seen and heard that the entire angelic heaven appears in the Lord's sight as a single person, and so, too, every society of heaven, and that for this reason every angel or spirit is a human being in perfect form. In the aforementioned treatises we have also shown as well that heaven is not heaven owing to anything of the angels' own, but because of the angels' reception of Divine love and wisdom from the Lord. <p>It can be seen from this that the Lord governs the entire angelic heaven as though it were a single person; that that heaven, being in itself human, is the very image and very likeness of the Lord; and that the Lord Himself governs that heaven as the soul governs its body. <p>So, because the entire human race is governed by the Lord, it can be seen that it is governed by the Lord not through heaven, but from heaven, consequently from Himself, because He is heaven, as we have said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 163</h4><p>163. I need to describe briefly, though, how the Lord guides and teaches each of us from the angelic heaven. In the work on Divine Love and Wisdom, earlier in this work on Divine Providence, and in the work on Heaven and Hell (published in London in 1758), I let it be known on the basis of things I have heard and seen that in the Lord's view the whole angelic heaven looks like a single person and that the same holds true for each heavenly community. This is why each individual spirit and angel is a perfectly formed person. In these works I have also explained that heaven is not heaven because of anything that belongs to angels but because of their acceptance of divine love and wisdom from the Lord. <p>This shows that the Lord governs the whole angelic heaven as though it were a single individual and that this heaven is the very image and likeness of the Lord because it is essentially a person. It shows also that the Lord himself governs that heaven the way a soul governs its body. <p>Since the whole human race is governed by the Lord, then, it shows that it is not governed by the Lord through heaven but from heaven, from himself, because as already noted, he is heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 163</h4><p>163. How the Lord from the angelic heaven leads and teaches every man will be stated in a few words. In the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, and above in this treatise THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, and also in the work HEAVEN AND HELL published in London in the year 1758, it has been made known from things seen and heard that the universal angelic heaven appears before the Lord as one man, and likewise every society of heaven; and that it is from this that every angel and spirit is a man in perfect form. It has also been shown in the works just mentioned that heaven is not heaven from anything belonging to the angels, but from the reception by the angels of the Divine Love and Wisdom from the Lord. Hence it may be evident that the Lord rules the universal angelic heaven as one man; and since that heaven is in itself a man, it is the very image and likeness of the Lord, and the Lord Himself rules that heaven as the soul rules the body; and since the whole human race is ruled by the Lord, it is ruled not through heaven but from heaven by the Lord, and consequently from Himself, because He is heaven, as has been stated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 163</h4><p>163. How the Lord leads and teaches every man from the angelic heaven shall be told in a few words. In the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, and above in this work on the Divine Providence, and also in the work on Heaven and Hell, published in London in 1758, it has been made known from things seen and heard that the whole angelic heaven appears before the Lord as one man, and likewise every society of heaven; and that it is from this that every angel and spirit is in complete form a man. In the above mentioned works it has also been shown that heaven is not heaven from any thing that is the angels' own, but from the reception by angels of the Divine love and wisdom from the Lord. From this it can be seen that the Lord rules the whole angelic heaven as one man, and inasmuch as that heaven in itself is a man, it is the very image and likeness of the Lord, and the Lord rules heaven as the soul rules its body; and as the whole human race is ruled by the Lord, it is ruled not through heaven but from heaven by the Lord, consequently from Himself, because He is heaven, as has been said before. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 163 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>163. Quomodo autem Dominus ducit et docet unumquemvis hominem e Coelo Angelico, paucis dicetur; in Transactione DE DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA, ac supra in hac Transactione de DIVINA PROVIDENTIA, <sup>1</sup>tum in Opere de COELO ET INFERNO Londini, Anno <sup>2</sup>1758, edito, ex visis et auditis notum factum est, quod universum Coelum Angelicum appareat coram Domino tanquam unus Homo, et quod similiter unaquaevis Societas coeli, et quod inde sit quod unusquisque Angelus et Spiritus in perfecta forma sit homo; et quoque in supradictis Transactionibus ostensum est, quod Coelum non sit Coelum ex proprio Angelorum, sed ex receptione Divini <sup>3</sup>Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae a Domino ab angelis: exinde constare potest, quod Dominus regat universum coelum angelicum sicut unum Hominem; et quod Coelum illud, quia in se est Homo, sit ipsa imago et ipsa similitudo Domini; et quod Ipse Dominus regat Coelum illud, sicut anima regit suum corpus. Et quia universum Genus humanum regitur a Domino, quod non regatur per Coelum, sed e Coelo a Domino, consequenter ex Se, quia Ipse est Coelum, ut dictum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: PROVIDENTIA;<p>2 Prima editio: Annon<p>3 Prima editio: Dlvini </p>
