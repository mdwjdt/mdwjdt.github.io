<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>288、所有天堂天使都坦承，没有人能从自己思考，只能从主思考；而所有地狱灵都声称，没有人能从其他任何人，只能从自己思考。事实上，这一点已经多次向这些灵人证明，即：他们当中没有任何人从自己或能从自己思考，这都是流入的，但没有任何效果，因为他们不愿接受这个事实。然而，经历首先教导，思维和情感的一切，甚至包括地狱灵的，都是从天堂流入的。问题是，所流入的良善在地狱被转变为邪恶，真理被转变为虚假；因此，一切都被转变为它的对立面。这一点是如此向我显示的：来自圣言的某个真理从天堂被发送下来，并被那些在地狱上层的人接受，然后被他们向下发送到低层地狱，直至最低层。一路上，它逐渐被转变为虚假，最后转变为与这个真理完全对立的一个虚假。改变它们的人以为是他们自己想出了这个虚假。他们只知道这一点，然而这个虚假就是那个从天堂流下来，一直流入最低层地狱的真理，只是这个真理被扭曲和败坏了。我有三四次听说这种事就是如此发生的。良善也是这样；当良善从天堂流下来时，它逐渐被转变为与它对立的邪恶。这使我清楚看出，真理和良善从主发出，并被那些处于虚假和邪恶的人接受；但它们完全被改变了，并取了另一种如此不同的形式，以至于再也看不出它的原始形式。这种事就发生在每个恶人身上，因为就其灵而言，他在地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 288</h4><p>288. That no one can think on his own but does so from the Lord is something all angels in heaven confess. But that no one can think from anyone other than himself is something all spirits in hell say. Although the latter have sometimes been shown that none of them thinks or can think on his own, but that thought flows in, still they have been shown in vain, being unwilling to accept it. <p>Empirical evidence will show, however, first, that every bit of thought and affection flows in from heaven, even in the case of spirits in hell, but that the good flowing in there is turned into evil, and the truth into falsity, thus everything into its opposite. This was demonstrated in the following way: <p>A certain truth from the Word was sent down from heaven, and this was received by people in the uppermost hell, who sent it down into lower hells until it reached the lowest, and on the way it was gradually turned into falsity, and finally into a falsity entirely opposite to the truth. And those in whom it was so transformed entertained the falsity as though of themselves, and did not know any differently, even though it was a truth flowing down from heaven that on the way to the lowest hell was thus falsified and distorted. <p>I have heard three or four times that this took place. The case is the same with good. Any good flowing down from heaven is gradually turned into an evil opposite to the good. <p>It was apparent from this that any truth or good emanating from the Lord is completely changed when received by people caught up in falsity and evil, and so transformed that the original form is no longer visible. <p>The like occurs in every evil person, for in respect to his spirit he is in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 288</h4><p>288. All of heaven's angels admit that no one can originate a thought, that all thinking comes from the Lord, while all the spirits of hell claim that thought cannot originate in anyone but themselves. Actually, these spirits have been shown any number of times that none of them are originating their own thoughts, that they cannot, and that it is all flowing in, but to no effect--they are unwilling to accept it. <p>However, experience will teach first of all that even for spirits in hell, every bit of thought and feeling is flowing in from heaven. The problem is that the inflowing good is being turned into evil in hell, and the truth is being turned into falsity. Everything becomes its opposite. This is how it was shown to me. Something true from the Word was let down from heaven and taken hold of by people in the upper levels of hell. They sent it on down to the lower hells all the way to the lowest. Step by step along this path the truth turned into falsity, finally into a falsity absolutely opposite to the truth. The people who were changing it thought they themselves were thinking up this falsity. That was all they knew, and yet the falsity was that truth flowing down from heaven on its way to the lowest hell, that truth falsified and distorted. Three or four times I have heard of this happening. The same thing happens to what is good. When this flows down from heaven it is turned step by step into the evil that is opposite to it. <p>This has enabled me to see that when what is true and good emanates from the Lord and is taken up by people who are devoted to what is false and evil, it is changed. It takes on another form so completely that its original form can no longer be seen. That is just what is going on with all who are evil, because in spirit they are in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 288</h4><p>288. All the angels of heaven confess that no one can think from himself but only from the Lord; while all the spirits of hell assert that no one can think from any other than himself. Yet it has sometimes been shown to these spirits that not one of them thinks or can think from himself, but that thought flows in. In vain, however, was this shown, for they would not accept it. Now experience will teach first, that all thought and affection, even with the spirits of hell, flow in from heaven; but that the good which flows in is, in hell, turned into evil and the truth into falsity, thus everything into its opposite. This was shown in the following manner. A certain truth from the Word was sent down from heaven, and was received by those who were in the upper region of hell, and by these was sent down to the lower hells, and so on to the lowest. On the successive stages of its way the truth was turned into falsity and finally into that falsity which was its direct opposite. Those with whom this change was made thought that the falsity was from themselves, nor did they know otherwise, although it was truth flowing down from heaven on its way to the lowest hell, which had become thus falsified and perverted. I have heard several times that this happened. The same thing takes place with good, which as it flows down from heaven is changed in its progress into the evil opposite to it. Hence it was evident that truth and good proceeding from the Lord as they are received by those who are in falsity and by those who are in evil are completely changed and pass into another form so different that the first form is not apparent. Thus it is with every wicked man, for such a one as to his spirit is in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 288</h4><p>288. That no one can think from himself, but can think only from the Lord, all the angels of heaven confess; while all the spirits of hell declare that no one can think from any other than himself. It has often been shown to these spirits, but in vain, for they were unwilling to accept it, that no one of them thinks or can think from himself, but that it is from influx. But experience will teach, in the first place, that every thing of thought and affection, even with the spirits of hell, flows in out of heaven; but that this inflowing good is there turned into evil and this truth into falsity, thus every thing into its opposite. This has been shown thus: A certain truth from the Word was sent down out of heaven, and was received by those who were in the upper part of hell, and by them it was sent down into the lower parts, even to the lowest; and on the way it was gradually turned into falsity and at last into a falsity wholly opposite to the truth; and those in whom this change was made were thinking the falsity as if from themselves, and did not know otherwise, although the truth thus falsified and perverted was a truth flowing down out of heaven on its way to the lowest hell. I have heard three or four times that it was so done. The same is true of good; this flowing down out of heaven is changed as it goes into the evil opposite to the good. Thus has it been made clear that truth and good going forth from the Lord and received by those who are in falsity and in evil are wholly changed, and pass into another form, so different that the first form is not apparent. The same thing takes place with every evil man, for he in respect to his spirit is in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 288 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>288. Quod nullus cogitare possit a se, sed a Domino, fatentur omnes Angeli Coeli, at quod nullus cogitare possit ab alio quam a se, dicunt omnes spiritus inferni; at his aliquoties ostensum est, quod non aliquis eorum cogitet ex se, nec possit, sed quod influat; verum frustra; non voluerunt recipere. Sed experientia docebit, primum, quod omne cogitationis et affectionis etiam apud spiritus inferni influat e Coelo, sed quod bonum influens ibi vertatur in malum, et quod verum in falsum, ita omne in oppositum; hoc ostensum est ita; demissum est e Coelo aliquod verum ex Verbo, et hoc exceptum est ab illis qui supra in inferno erant, et ab his demissum est in inferiora usque ad infimum, ac id in via, successive versum est in falsum, et tandem in falsum prorsus oppositum vero; et illi apud quos vertebatur, cogitabant falsum sicut ex se, et non sciebant aliter, cum tamen erat verum e coelo defluens in via ad infimum infernum ita falsificatum et perversum. Quod ita factum, ter aut quater audivi: simile fit cum bono; hoc defluens e Coelo progressive vertitur in malum bono oppositum. Inde patuit, quod verum et bonum a Domino procedens exceptum ab illis qui in falso et in malo sunt, permutetur, et in aliam formam transeat, usque ut prima forma non appareat. Simile fit apud omnem hominem malum, nam ille quoad spiritum suum est in inferno. </p>
