<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第218节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>218、⑶短暂事物和永恒事物被人分离，但被主结合起来。这是因为，属于人的一切事物都是短暂的，人由此可称作短暂的；而属于主的一切事物是永恒的，主由此可称作永恒的。短暂事物是指那些有结束、会消亡的事物；而永恒事物是指那些没有结束、不会消亡的事物。谁都能看出，两者只有通过主的无限智慧才能结合在一起，因而能被主结合，不能被人结合。为叫人们知道，两者被人分开，但被主结合，有必要按下列顺序予以说明：①何为短暂事物，何为永恒事物。②人本身是短暂的，主本身是永恒的；所以从人发出的，只有短暂事物，从主发出的，只有永恒事物。③短暂事物将永恒事物与自身分离，永恒事物将短暂事物与自身结合。④主藉着表象与人结合。⑤也藉着对应。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 218</h4><p>218. (3) Temporal and eternal ends are separated by mankind, but conjoined by the Lord. This is the case because everything proper to mankind is temporal, so that the human being may be called temporal, while everything proper to the Lord is eternal, so that the Lord is called the Eternal. Moreover, temporal things are ones that have an end and perish, while eternal things are ones that do not have an end and do not perish. <p>The fact that these two can be conjoined only by the Lord's infinite wisdom, and thus that they can be conjoined by the Lord and not by mankind, is something everyone can see. <p>For it to be known, however, that these two are separated by mankind and conjoined by the Lord, it must be demonstrated under the following series of headings: <p>1. What temporal things are and what eternal things are. <p>2. A person in himself is temporal, and the Lord in Himself eternal; and from a person therefore nothing can issue but what is temporal, and from the Lord nothing but what is eternal. <p>3. Temporal ends separate eternal ones from themselves, while eternal ends conjoin temporal ones with themselves. <p>4. The Lord conjoins a person with Himself through appearances. <p>5. And through correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 218</h4><p>218. 3. We keep temporal and eternal matters separate, but the Lord unites them. This is because everything about us is time-bound, so that we ourselves may be called time-bound, while everything about the Lord is eternal, so that the Lord is called the Eternal One. Time-bound things are the ones that have a limit and that perish, while eternal things are the ones that have no limit and do not perish. <p>Everyone can see that these two cannot be united except by the Lord's infinite wisdom, which means that they can be united by the Lord but not by us. To show that we separate the two but the Lord unites them, I need to present an explanation in the following sequence. (a) What "time-bound" and "eternal" things are. (b) We are essentially time-bound, and the Lord is essentially eternal. Therefore, nothing comes from us that is not time-bound, and nothing comes from the Lord that is not eternal. (c) The time-bound separates the eternal from itself, while the eternal unites the time-bound to itself. (d) The Lord unites us to himself by means of appearances, (e) and by means of correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 218</h4><p>218. III. TEMPORAL AND ETERNAL THINGS ARE SEPARATED BY MAN, BUT ARE CONJOINED BY THE LORD. This is so because all things pertaining to man are temporal, and from these man may be called temporal; while all things pertaining to the Lord are eternal, and from these the Lord is called Eternal. Moreover, temporal things are those which have an end and perish, but eternal things are those which have no end and do not perish. Everyone may see that these two cannot be joined together unless by the infinite wisdom of the Lord, and therefore that they can be joined together by the Lord, but not by man. However, in order that it may be made known that these two are separated by man and are conjoined by the Lord it shall be shown in the following order:<p>1. What temporal things are, and what eternal things are.<p>2. Man is in himself temporal and the Lord is in Himself eternal; and therefore nothing can proceed from man but what is temporal, and nothing from the Lord but what is eternal.<p>3. Temporal things separate eternal things from themselves, and eternal things conjoin temporal things to themselves.<p>4. The Lord conjoins man to Himself by means of appearances;<p>5. And also by means of correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 218</h4><p>218. (3) Temporal things and eternal things are separated by man, but are conjoined by the Lord. This is true because all things pertaining to man are temporal, and for this reason man may be called temporal; while all things pertaining to the Lord are eternal, and for this reason the Lord is called Eternal. Temporal things are those that have an end and perish; while eternal things are those that have no end and do not perish. Any one can see that the two can be conjoined only through the Lord's infinite wisdom, and thus can be conjoined by the Lord, but not by man. But to make known that the two are separated by man and are conjoined by the Lord it must be shown in this order: <p>(1) What temporal things are, and what eternal things are. <p>(2) Man is in himself temporal and the Lord is in Himself eternal; and therefore only what is temporal can proceed from man, and only what is eternal from the Lord. <p>(3) Temporal things separate eternal things from themselves, and eternal things conjoin temporal things to themselves. <p>(4) The Lord conjoins man with Himself by means of appearances. <p>(5) Also by means of correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 218 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>218. III. Quod temporaria ac aeterna separentur ab homine, sed quod conjungantur <sup>1</sup>a Domino: quod ita sit, est quia omnia hominis sunt temporaria, ex quibus homo potest vocari temporarius, ac omnia Domini sunt aeterna, ex quibus Dominus vocatur Aeternus; ac temporaria sunt quae finem habent et pereunt, at aeterna sunt quae non finem habent, et non pereunt. Quod haec duo non conjungi possint, nisi quam per infinitam sapientiam Domini, et sic quod a Domino conjungi possint, et non ab homine, quisque potest videre. Ut autem sciatur, quod illa duo ab homine separentur, et a Domino conjungantur, demonstrandum est in hoc ordine. 1. Quid temporaria et quid aeterna. 2. Quod homo sit temporarius in se, et quod Dominus sit aeternus in Se; <sup>2</sup>et quod inde ab homine non possit procedere nisi quam temporarium, et quod a Domino non nisi quam aeternum. 3. Quod temporaria separent aeterna a se, et quod aeterna conjungant temporaria sibi. 4. Quod Dominus conjungat hominem Sibi <sup>3</sup>per apparentias. 5. Et quod per correspondentias.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: conjungan / gantur<p>2 Prima editio: se;<p>3 Prima editio: sibi </p>
