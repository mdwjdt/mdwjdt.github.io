<h4 align="center"></h4><p>85、人通过被称为理性和自由的这两种官能被改造和重生，没有它们，他无法被改造和重生，因为通过理性，他能明白和知道何为邪恶，何为良善，因而何为虚假，何为真理；通过自由，他能意愿他所明白和知道的。但只要对邪恶的爱之快乐掌权，他就不能自由地意愿良善和真理，并把它们纳入理性思维，因而不能把它们变成自己的一部分。因为如前所示（78-81节），人出于自由照理性所做的事，会实际上成为他的一部分；除非良善和真理成为人的一部分，否则，他无法被改造和重生。再者，人不会出于对良善和真理的爱之快乐行动，除非对邪恶和虚假的爱之快乐被除去，因为这两种对立的爱的快乐无法共存。出于来自爱的快乐行动就是出于自由行动；由于理性支持爱，所以这也是照理性行动。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 85</h4><p>85. <sup>1</sup>We say that it is by means of these two faculties called rationality and freedom that a person is reformed and regenerated, and that he cannot be reformed and regenerated apart from them; and the reason is that it is by virtue of rationality that he is able to understand and know what is evil and what is good, and thus what is false and what is true, and it is by virtue of freedom that he is able to will what he understands and knows. As long as the delight of an evil love reigns, however, he cannot will good and truth freely and make them matters of his reason. Consequently he cannot make them his. For as we showed above, the things that a person does in freedom in accordance with his reason become attached to him as his, and unless they become attached as his, the person is not reformed and regenerated. <p>A person then acts for the first time from the delight of a love of good and truth when the delight of a love of evil and falsity has been removed. For two delights of love opposed to each other are not possible at the same time. To be moved to act by the delight of one's love is to act in freedom, and because one's reason is inclined to go along with the love, it is also to act in accordance with one's reason. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp; The number 84 in the sequence was accidentally omitted. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 85</h4><p>85. The reason we are reformed and regenerated by means of the two abilities known as rationality and freedom, the reason that in fact we cannot be reformed and regenerated without them, is that it is through our rationality that we can discern and know what is evil and what is good and therefore what is false and what is true. Then through our freedom we can intend what we discern and know. As long as the pleasure of a love for evil is in control, though, we are not free to intend things that are good and true and make them a matter of our rationality, so we cannot make them part of ourselves. This is because the things that we do freely and in accord with reason, as already explained [<a href="78.htm">78-81</a>], become virtually part of us, and unless they do become part of us, we cannot be reformed and regenerated. We do not act because of the pleasure that comes from a love for what is good and true until the pleasure of a love for what is evil and false has been displaced, since the pleasures of two opposite loves cannot coexist. <p>Acting from the pleasure that comes from love is acting freely, and since our reason seconds our love, it is also acting rationally. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 85</h4><p>85. <sup>1</sup>Man is reformed and regenerated by means of these two faculties, called rationality and liberty, and he cannot be reformed and regenerated without them; because it is by means of rationality that he can understand and know what is evil and what is good, and it is by means of liberty that he can will what he understands and knows. As long, however, as delight from the love of evil rules he cannot will freely what is good and what is true and make these principles of his reason and so appropriate them to himself. For, as was shown above, such things as a man does from freedom according to reason are appropriated to him as his own; and unless they are appropriated as his own, man is not reformed and regenerated. Again, man first acts from the delight of the love of goodness and truth when the delight of the love of evil and falsity has been removed, for two kinds of love's delight which are opposite to each other cannot exist together at the same time. To act from the delight of love is to act from freedom; and because reason favours the love, it is also to act according to reason.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This number follows 83, as in the Original Edition. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 85</h4><p>85. By means of these two faculties, called rationality and liberty, man is reformed and regenerated, and without them he cannot be reformed and regenerated, for it is by means of rationality that he is able to understand and know what is evil and what is good, and thus what is false and what is true; and it is by means of liberty that he is able to will what he understands and knows. But so long as enjoyment from the love of evil rules he is not able to will freely what is good and true and to make these to be of his reason, and cannot therefore appropriate them to himself. For, as shown above, it is that which a man does from freedom in accordance with reason that is appropriated to him as his; and unless good and truth are appropriated as his, man is not reformed and regenerated. Again, man does not act from an enjoyment of the love of good and truth until the enjoyment from the love of evil and falsity has been removed; for two kinds of enjoyment from love that are opposites are not possible at the same time. Acting from an enjoyment of love is acting from freedom; and since reason favors the love, this is also acting in accordance with reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 85 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>85. <sup>1</sup>Quod homo per binas illas facultates, quae vocantur rationalitas et libertas, reformetur et regeneretur, et quod absque illis reformari et regenerari non possit, est quia per Rationalitatem potest intelligere et scire quid malum et quid bonum, et inde quid falsum et verum; et per Libertatem potest velle id quod intelligit et scit: sed quamdiu jucundum amoris mali regnat, non potest libere velle bonum et verum, et illa rationis suae facere, quare non potest illa sibi appropriare; <sup>2</sup>nam ut supra ostensum est, illa quae homo ex libero secundum rationem agit, illi appropriantur ut ejus, et nisi appropriantur ut ejus, homo non reformatur et regeneratur: et tunc primum ex jucundo amoris boni et veri agit, quando jucundum amoris mali et falsi remotum est; nam duo jucunda amoris sibi opposita non simul dantur; ex jucundo amoris agere, est ex libero, et quia ratio favet amori, etiam est secundum rationem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Numerus 84 in ordine per errorem praeteritus est.<p>2 Prima editio: approprare; </p>
