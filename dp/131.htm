<h4 align="center"></h4><p>131、由此可见，神迹所诱发的信仰不是真正的信仰，而是说服，或二手信仰。因为它里面没有任何理性的东西，更没有任何属灵的东西；事实上，它只是没有一个内在的一个外在。这适用于一个人基于这种说服性信仰或二手信仰所做的一切事，无论他是否承认神，是在家里还是在教会敬拜祂，或是行善。当唯独一个神迹把一个人引向承认、敬拜和虔诚时，他是出于属世人，而不是属灵人行动。因为神迹是通过一种外在途径，而非一种内在途径，因而是从世界，而不是从天堂赋予信仰。主只通过一种内在途径，也就是通过圣言，以及基于圣言的教义和讲道进入人。神迹因关闭这条途径，故如今不再发生了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 131</h4><p>131. It can be seen from this that a faith induced by miracles is not faith but a persuasion, for it has no rationality in it, still less anything spiritual, being only something external without anything internal. It is the same with everything that a person does in conformity with such a persuasive faith, even if he acknowledges God, worships Him at home or in churches, and does good works. <p>When it is miracle alone that leads a person to acknowledgment, worship, and a pious life, he acts with his natural self and not with his spiritual self, for a miracle infuses faith by an external path and not by an internal path, thus from the world and not from heaven. And the only path by which the Lord enters in a person is an internal path, which is through the Word, doctrine from the Word, and preaching and teaching from it. For that reason, because miracles close this path, therefore no miracles are done today. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 131</h4><p>131. This shows us that a faith caused by miracles is not real faith but only second-hand belief. It has no rational content, let alone spiritual content. It is actually an outer shell with nothing inside it. The same holds true of everything we do on the basis of this kind of second-hand faith, whether it is acknowledging God, worshiping him at home or in church, or benefiting others. When the only thing that prompts the acknowledgment, the worship, and the devotion is some miracle, then we are acting from the earthly level of our human nature and not from the spiritual level, because the miracle instills faith from the outside and not from the inside--from the world, then, and not from heaven. The Lord enters us only from the inside, that is, by means of the Word and by lessons and sermons based on the Word. Since miracles close this inner route, miracles do not happen nowadays. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 131</h4><p>131. From these considerations it may be evident that faith induced by miracles is not faith but persuasion; for there is nothing rational in it, still less anything spiritual, as it is only external without an internal. It is the same with all that a man does from this persuasive faith, whether he acknowledges God, or worships Him at home or at church, or performs good deeds. When a miracle alone leads a man to the acknowledgment of God, to worship, and to piety, he acts from the natural man and not from the spiritual. For a miracle infuses faith by an external and not by an internal way, thus from the world and not from heaven. Now the Lord does not enter by any other way with man than the internal way, which is by the Word, by doctrine and by preaching from it; and as miracles close up this way, at this day no miracles are wrought. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 131</h4><p>131. From all this it can be seen that a faith induced by miracles is not faith but persuasion; for there is nothing rational in it, still less anything spiritual; for it is only an external without an internal. The same is true of every thing that a man does from such a persuasive faith, whether he acknowledges God, worships Him at home or in churches, or does good deeds. When a miracle alone leads a man to acknowledgment, worship, and piety, he acts from the natural man and not from the spiritual. For a miracle imparts faith through an external way and not through an internal way, thus from the world and not from heaven; and the Lord enters into man through no other than an internal way, which is through the Word, and doctrine and preachings from the Word. And as miracles close this way, at this day no miracles are wrought. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 131 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>131. Ex his constare potest, quod fides inducta per miracula, non sit fides, sed persuasio, <sup>1</sup>non enim aliquod rationale est in illa, minus aliquod spirituale, est enim modo externum absque interno: simile est cum omni quod homo ex fide illa persuasive <sup>2</sup>facit, sive agnoscat Deum, sive colat Ipsum domi aut in templis, sive benefaciat: cum solum miraculum inducit hominem ad agnitionem, cultum et pietatem, agit ille ex naturali homine, et non ex spirituali, nam miraculum infundit fidem per viam externam, et non per viam internam, ita ex mundo, et non ex coelo; et Dominus non per aliam viam intrat apud hominem quam per viam internam, quae est per Verbum, doctrinam et praedicationes ex illo; et quia miracula claudunt hanc viam, ideo hodie nulla miracula fiunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: persvasio,<p>2 Prima editio: persvasiva </p>
