<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第292节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>292、人所思所愿，并由此所言所行的一切，都是从唯一的生命之源流入的；然而，这唯一的生命之源，也就是主，并不是人们思想邪恶和虚假的原因，这一点可通过以下方式从自然界来说明。自然界的太阳发出热和光，这两者流入肉眼可见的一切器皿和物体，既流入良善的器皿和美丽的物体，也流入邪恶的器皿和丑陋的物体，并在它们上面产生各种不同的效果。因为它们不但流入结好果子的树，还流入结坏果子的树，甚至流入果子本身，使它们生长。它们同样流入好种子和稗子，还流入灌木，无论有用有益的，还是有害有毒的。然而，热还是那个热，光还是那个光；它里面没有邪恶的原因；相反，原因只在于接受的器皿和物体。<p>热怎样孵化猫头鹰或毒蛇的蛋，就怎样孵化鸽子、美丽的鸟或天鹅的蛋。把这两种蛋放在一个母鸡下面，它们都能靠母鸡的体温被孵化出来，这体温本身是无害的。那么，这热与那些邪恶有害的生物有什么共同之处呢？热怎样流入沼泽，以及粪质、败坏和腐烂的东西，就怎样流入像酒一样、芳香四溢、活跃有生机的东西。谁看不出原因不在于热，而在于接受的器皿和物体？再者，同样的光，当它流入一个物体时，会折射出美丽的色彩；而当它流入另一个物体时，则折射出让人不舒服的色彩。实际上，它甚至在亮白的物体上变得明亮发光，在接近黑色的物体上变得暗淡无光。 <p>同样的事也发生在灵界。那里也有从灵界太阳，也就是主发出的热和光；这太阳发出的热和光流入它们的器皿和物体。那里的器皿和物体是天使和灵人，具体来说，就是属于他们的意愿和理解力之物；那里的热是神性之爱的发出，那里的光是神性智慧的发出。这些不是他们彼此接受不同的原因，因为主说：<p>祂叫日头照好人，也照歹人；降雨给义人，也给不义的人。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">（马太福音5:45）</a><p>就至高意义而言，“日头”表示神性之爱，“雨”表示神性智慧。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 292</h4><p>292. The fact that everything a person thinks and wills and so speaks and does flows in from a single fount of life, and yet that the single fount of life, namely the Lord, is not the cause of a person's thinking evil and falsity, may be illustrated by the following circumstance in the natural world: <p>From the sun in that world emanate heat and light, and these two flow into all vessels and objects visible to the eye - not only into good vessels and beautiful objects, but also into evil vessels and ugly objects - and produce various effects in them. For they flow not only into trees bearing good fruit but also into trees bearing harmful fruit, as well as into the fruits themselves, and cause their growth. They flow likewise into good seeds and also into weeds. So, too, into bushes that serve a good purpose or are healthful, and also into bushes that serve an evil purpose or are toxic. And yet it is the same heat and the same light, in which no cause of any evil is to be found. Rather the cause lies in the recipient vessels and objects.</p><p>[2] The warmth that hatches eggs containing a screech owl, eagle owl, or asp operates the same as when it hatches eggs containing a dove, ornamental bird, or swan. Put both kinds of eggs under a hen, and her warmth, which in itself is harmless, will hatch both. What, then, does the warmth have in common with those harmful and noxious creatures? <p>The warmth flowing into marshy, feculent, rotten or decayed recipients operates the same as when it flows into wine-making, fragrant, growing and living ones. Who does not see that the cause lies not in the warmth but in the receiving vessel? <p>The same light, too, on one object presents pleasing colors, and on another disagreeable ones. Indeed it shines brightly on white objects and radiates, and grows dim on those nearly black and becomes dusky.</p><p>[3] It is the same in the spiritual world. Heat and light exist there, too, from its sun, which is the Lord, and they flow from that sun into their vessels and objects. The vessels and objects there are angels and spirits - in specific their volitional and intellectual constituents. The heat there is Divine love emanating, and the light there is Divine wisdom emanating. These are not the cause of their being received by one recipient differently from another. For the Lord says that "He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). By the sun in the highest spiritual sense is meant Divine love, and by rain Divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 292</h4><p>292. Everything we think and intend and therefore everything we say and do flows in from the only fount of life; and yet that one fount of life, the Lord, is not the cause of our thinking things that are evil and false. <p>There are enlightening parallels in the physical world. Warmth and light radiate from its sun, and these two flow into all the subjects and objects that we see with our eyes, not only good subjects and beautiful objects, but also bad subjects and ugly objects; and they bring forth different effects in each. They flow not only into trees that bear good fruit but into trees that bear bad fruit, flowing into the actual fruit itself and helping it to develop. They flow into the good seed and into the weeds, into useful, healthful shrubs and into harmful, toxic shrubs. Yet it is the same warmth and the same light; and there is no cause of evil in it, only in the subjects and objects that receive it.</p><p>[2] The same can be said of the warmth that hatches the eggs of owls or vipers and the eggs of doves, beautiful birds, and swans. Putting both kinds of egg under a hen and her warmth, which in and of itself is harmless, will hatch them. What does this warmth have in common with these evil and noxious creatures? <p>The same applies to the warmth that flows into swamps, manure, decay, and decomposition and into things that are winelike, fragrant, sparkling, and alive. Can anyone fail to see that the cause is not in the warmth but in the receptive subject? <p>The very same light, too, makes beautiful colors when it flows into one object and unpleasant colors when it flows into another. Actually, it is displaying itself and glowing in bright objects and dimming itself as objects become blacker, darkening itself.</p><p>[3] The same thing happens in the spiritual world. There are also warmth and light there from its sun, which is the Lord, flowing from him into their subjects and objects. The subjects and objects there are angels and spirits, specifically their processes of volition and discernment. The warmth there is the radiating divine love and the light there is the radiating divine wisdom. They are not responsible for the fact that different people receive them differently, for the Lord says, "He makes his sun rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). In its highest spiritual meaning the sun means divine love and the rain means divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 292</h4><p>292. Everything that a man thinks and wills, and consequently speaks and does, flows in from one sole Fountain of life, and yet that one Fountain of life, which is the Lord, is not the cause of a man's thinking what is evil and false. This can be illustrated by the following circumstances in the natural world. From the sun of this world proceed heat and light; and these two flow into all subjects and objects that appear before the eyes, not only into subjects that are good and objects that are beautiful, but also into subjects that are evil and objects that are ugly, producing in them various effects. For they flow not only into trees that bear good fruit but also into trees that bear bad fruit, and even into the fruits themselves, imparting to them quickening power. They likewise flow into good seed and also into tares; also into shrubs that have a good use or are wholesome, and also into shrubs that have an evil use or are poisonous. Yet it is the same heat and the same light, and in these there is no cause of evil; but the cause is in the recipient subjects and objects.</p><p>[2] The heat which hatches eggs in which lie the bird of night, the screech-owl and the viper acts in the same way as when it hatches eggs in which lie the dove, the bird of paradise and the swan. Set eggs of both kinds under a hen and they will be hatched by her heat, which in itself is free from harm. What then has the heat in common with those evil and noxious things? The heat that flows into the marsh and the dung-hill, and into dead and putrefying matter acts in the same way as when it flows into the vine sapling and the fragrant herb, and into luxuriant vegetation and bodies pulsing with life. Who does not see that the cause is not in the heat but in the recipient subject? On the other hand, the same light brings out in one object colours that are pleasing, and in another colours that are not pleasing; it even brightens itself up and sends out brilliant rays in white objects, but in objects that verge towards black it dims and darkens itself.</p><p>[3] It is the same in the spiritual world; for there also are heat and light from its Sun, which is the Lord, and these flow from that Sun into their subjects and objects. The subjects and objects there are angels and spirits, in particular, what pertains to their will and understanding, the heat there being the Divine Love going forth, and the light there the Divine Wisdom going forth. These are not the cause of their being received differently by one and by another; for the Lord says,<p>He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>.<p>By the Sun in the highest spiritual sense is meant the Divine Love, and by the rain the Divine Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 292</h4><p>292. That everything that a man thinks and wills and speaks and does therefrom flows in from the one fountain of life, and yet that the one fountain of life, that is, the Lord, is not the cause of man's thinking evil and falsity, can be illustrated in this way from the natural world: That from its sun heat and light go forth, and these two flow into all subjects and objects that appear before the eyes, both into good subjects and beautiful objects and into evil subjects and unbeautiful objects, and produce in these a variety of effects; for they flow both into trees that bear good fruits and also into trees that bear evil fruits, and even into the fruits themselves and cause them to grow. They flow likewise into good seed and into tares; also into shrubs that have a good use or are wholesome, and into shrubs that have an evil use or are poisonous; and yet it is the same heat and the same light, in which there is no cause of evil; but the cause is in the recipient subjects and objects.</p><p>[2] The heat that hatches eggs containing the screech-owl, the horned owl, or the viper, acts in the same way as when it hatches eggs in which lie hidden the dove, the beautiful bird, or the swan. Put eggs of the two kinds under a hen, and they will be hatched by her heat, which in itself is free from harm. What, then, has the heat in common with these evil and noxious things? The heat that flows into marshy, stercoraceous, putrid, and cadaverous substances acts in the same way as when it flows into things vinous, fragrant, active and living. Who does not see that the cause is not in the heat but in the recipient subject? Again, the same light presents pleasing colors in one object and disagreeable colors in another; it even grows bright and glows in objects of shining whiteness, and becomes dim and dusky in those verging to black.</p><p>[3] The same is true in the spiritual world. There, too, there are heat and light, from its sun, which is the Lord; and from that sun these flow into their subjects and objects. The subjects and objects there are angels and spirits, particularly their voluntary and intellectual capacities. The heat there is the Divine love going forth, and the light there is the Divine wisdom going forth; and these are not the cause of the difference in their reception by one and by another, for the Lord says that <p>He makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). <p>In the highest spiritual sense "the sun" means the Divine love, and "rain" the Divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 292 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>292. Quod ab unico fonte vitae influat omne quod homo cogitat et vult, et inde quod loquitur et facit, et quod usque unicus fons vitae, qui est Dominus, non in causa sit quod homo cogitet malum et falsum, illustrari potest per haec in Mundo naturali: a Sole ejus procedit calor et lux, et illa duo influunt in omnia subjecta et objecta, quae coram oculis apparent, non modo in subjecta bona et in objecta pulchra, sed etiam in subjecta mala et in objecta impulchra, et producunt varia in illis: influunt enim non solum in arbores, quae ferunt fructus bonos, sed etiam in arbores quae ferunt fructus malos, imo etiam in ipsos fructus, et dant vegetationes illis; similiter in semina bona, et quoque in zizanias: tum etiam in virgulta boni usus seu salutifera, et quoque in virgulta mali usus seu toxicata; et tamen idem calor est, et eadem lux, in quibus non aliqua causa mali, sed haec in subjectis et objectis recipientibus est.</p><p>[2] Simile facit calor qui excludit ova, in quibus latet ulula, bubo, aspis, sicut dum excludit ova, in quibus latet columba, avis pulchra et olor; pone sub gallina ova utriusque generis, et ab ejus calore, qui in se est innocuus, illa excludentur; quid itaque calor commune habet cum malis et noxiis illis. Similiter facit calor in paludinosa, stercorea, putria et cadaverosa influens, sicut facit cum in vinosa, fragrantia, vegeta et viva; quis non videt, quod causa non sit in calore, sed in subjecto recipiente. Eadem etiam lux in uno objecto sistit colores amaenos, et in altero inamaenos; imo illustrat se in candidis et fulget, et opacat se in vergentibus ad nigrum, et furvat se.</p><p>[3] Simile est in Mundo spirituali; ibi quoque est calor et lux a suo Sole, qui est Dominus, quae ex illo influunt in sua subjecta et objecta; subjecta et objecta ibi sunt angeli et spiritus, in specie voluntaria et intellectualia illorum; Calor ibi est Divinus amor procedens, ac Lux ibi est Divina sapientia procedens; haec non sunt in causa, quod ab uno aliter recipiantur quam ab altero; nam dicit Dominus, "Quod Solem exoriri faciat super malos et bonos, et pluviam mittat super justos et injustos," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_292/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_45">Matthaeus 5:45</a>; per Solem in supremo spirituali sensu intelligitur Divinus Amor, et per pluviam Divina Sapientia. </p>
