<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第156节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>156、人唯独被主引领和教导，意思是说，人唯独靠主活着，或说主是人生命的唯一源头；因为被引领的，是他生命的意愿，被教导的，是他生命的理解力。但这与表象相反，因为在人看来，他似乎靠自己活着，而事实上，他是靠着主，而不是凭他自己活着。只要人还活在这个世界上，他就无法被赋予他唯独靠主活着的明显感觉。靠自己活着的表象永远不会从人那里被拿走，因为没有这种表象，人不是一个人。这就是为何我需要能被经验证实，最后能被圣言证实的理性论据来证明这个问题。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 156</h4><p>156. A person is led and taught by the Lord alone because he lives from the Lord alone, it being his life's will that is led, and his life's intellect that is taught. But this is contrary to the appearance, for it appears to a person that he lives of himself; and yet the reality is that he lives from the Lord and not from himself. <p>Now because as long as he lives in the world a person cannot be given a conscious perception that he lives from the Lord alone - since the appearance that he lives of himself is not taken from him, for without it a person would not be human - therefore we have to establish it by rational considerations, which must then be confirmed by empirical observation, and finally by the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 156</h4><p>156. To say that we are led and taught by the Lord alone is to say that the Lord is the only source of our life, since it is the intentions of our life that are led and the intelligence of our life that is taught. This is not the way it seems, though. It seems to us as though we live on our own, when the truth is that the Lord is the source of our life and we are not. As long as we are living in this world, we cannot be given a palpable sense that our life is coming from the Lord alone. We are not deprived of our sense of living on our own, because that is what makes us human. This is why I need to prove the matter with rational arguments that can then be tested against experience and finally tested against the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 156</h4><p>156. That man is led and taught by the Lord alone means that he lives from the Lord alone; for his life's will is led, and his life's understanding is taught. This, however, is contrary to appearance; for it appears to man that he lives from himself, while the truth is that he lives from the Lord and not of himself. Now, because there cannot be given to man, so long as he is in the world, the perception by sensation that he lives from the Lord alone, since the appearance that he lives from himself is not taken away from him, for without it a man is not a man, therefore it must be established by reasons, which must afterwards be confirmed by experience, and finally by the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 156</h4><p>156. That man is led and taught by the Lord alone means that he lives from the Lord alone; for what is led is his life's will, and what is taught is his life's understanding. But this is contrary to the appearance; for man seems to himself to live from himself, while the truth is that he lives from the Lord and not from himself. Since, then, so long as man remains in this world no perception by sensation can be given him that he lives from the Lord alone (because the appearance that he lives from himself is never taken away from him, for without it a man is not a man), therefore this truth must be established by reasons, and these must be confirmed by experience, and finally by the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 156 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>156. Quod homo a solo Domino ducatur et doceatur, est quod a solo Domino vivat, nam vitae ejus voluntas ducitur, et vitae ejus intellectus docetur: sed hoc contra apparentiam est, apparet enim homini sicut vivat ex se, et tamen veritas est, quod vivat a Domino, et non a semet: nunc quia non dari potest homini, quamdiu in mundo est, perceptio sensationis quod vivat a solo Domino, quoniam apparentia quod vivat ex se non ei aufertur, nam absque illa homo non est homo, <sup>1</sup>ideo hoc per rationes evincendum est, quae postea confirmandae sunt per experientiam, et demum per Verbum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: homo; </p>
