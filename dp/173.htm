<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第173节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>173、我在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》<a href="../ss/104.htm">（104-113节）</a>解释了，那些在教会之外，没有圣言的人也通过圣言获得光。既然人通过圣言获得光，并从这光获得理解力，既然恶人和善人都拥有理解力，那么可推知，这光从它的源头进入其衍生形式，也就是对凡涉及我们的东西的感觉和思维。主说：<p>离了祂，人就不能做什么。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">（约翰福音15:5）</a><p>若不是从天上赐的，人就不能得什么。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">（约翰福音3:27）</a><p>天父叫日头照好人，也照歹人；降雨给义人，也给不义的人。这样，就可以作你们天父的儿子。因为他叫日头照好人，也照歹人，降雨给义人，也给不义的人。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">（马太福音5:45）</a><p>在圣言中，和别处一样，此处的“日头”在灵义上表示神性之爱的神性良善；“雨”表示神性智慧的神性真理。这些既赐给好人，也赐给歹人，既赐给义人，也赐给不义的人；因为若不赐给他们，就没有人拥有感觉和思维。前面（157节）说明，有独一的生命，所有人都从这生命而拥有生命，或说这生命是所有人生命的源头；感觉和思维是生命的功能，或说属于生命，所以感觉和思维来自同一个源头，就是生命所来自的那个源头。构成理解力的一切光皆来自灵界太阳，这太阳就是主，这一点已经充分说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 173</h4><p>173. In <a href="../ss/104.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture 104-113</a>, we showed that through the Word people have light also who are outside the church and do not have the Word. <p>Moreover, because a person has light through the Word, and because of that light understanding, and this in the case of evil people as well as good, it follows that from that light in its origin comes light in its derivations, which are people's perceptions and thoughts about any matter. The Lord says that without Him they can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>); that a person can obtain nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>); and that their Father in heaven makes His sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). Here, as elsewhere in the Word, by the sun is meant in its spiritual sense the Divine goodness of Divine love, and by rain the Divine truth of Divine wisdom. These are granted to the evil and the good and to the just and the unjust, for if they were not, no one would have any perception or thought. <p>There is only one life from which all others have life, as we have shown above, and perception and thought are properties of life. Consequently from the same source from which life originates spring also perception and thought. <p>The fact that the light that forms the intellect all comes from the sun of the spiritual world, which is the Lord, is something we have demonstrated many times before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 173</h4><p>173. I explained in <a href="../ss/104.htm">Teachings for the New Jerusalem on Sacred Scripture 104-113</a> that people who are outside the church and do not have the Word also receive light by means of the Word. Since light comes to us through the Word, and since we derive from that light a discernment (which both evil and good people possess), it follows that from its source light comes into those derivative forms that are our sensations and thoughts about whatever concerns us. The Lord said that we can do nothing apart from him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>), that we can acquire nothing unless it is given us from heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>), and that the Father in heaven makes his sun rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). Here as elsewhere in the Word, the sun in its spiritual sense means the divine good of divine love, and the rain means the divine truth of divine wisdom. These are given to evil people and good people, to just people and unjust people, because otherwise no one would have either sensation or thought. <p>I have already explained [<a href="157.htm">157</a>] that there is only one life that is the source of life for us all; and sensation and thought are functions of life, so we get sensation and thought from the same source as life. I have also presented ample evidence that all the light that constitutes our discernment comes from the sun of the spiritual world, which is the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 173</h4><p>173. It is shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE (n. <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>), that by means of the Word they also have light who are outside the Church and who do not have the Word. Since man has light by means of the Word and from this light has understanding, and as both the wicked and the good have understanding, it follows that from light in its origin there is light in its derivatives, which are perceptions and thoughts respecting all subjects. The Lord says:<p>That without Him men can do nothing. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>.<p>That a man can receive nothing except it has been given him from heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>.<p>And that the father in the heavens makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>.<p>By the sun here as elsewhere in the Word in its spiritual sense is meant the Divine Good of the Divine Love; and by rain the Divine Truth of the Divine Wisdom. These are given to the evil and to the good, to the just and to the unjust, for unless they were given no one would have perception and thought. It has been shown above that there is only one life from which all have life. Now perception and thought belong to life; therefore perception and thought are from the same fountain from which life springs. That all the light forming the understanding is from the Sun of the spiritual world, which is the Lord, has already been abundantly shown. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 173</h4><p>173. That by means of the Word they also have light who are not in the church and do not have the Word is shown in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (<a href="104.htm">104-113</a>). And since man has light through the Word, and from that light has understanding, and as both the evil and the good have understanding, it follows that from the light in its origin there is light in its derivatives, which are perceptions and thoughts respecting all subjects. The Lord says:- <p>That without Him man can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>). <p>That a man can receive nothing except it has been given him from heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>). <p>And that the Father in the heavens maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). <p>By "the sun," here as elsewhere in the Word, is meant in its spiritual sense the Divine good of the Divine love; and by "rain," the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom. These are given to the evil and the good, to the just and the unjust; for unless they were given no one would have perception and thought. That there is only one life, from which all have life, has been shown above; and perception and thought belong to life, consequently perception and thought are from the same fountain from which life is. That all the light that constitutes the understanding is from the sun of the spiritual world, which is the Lord, has already been fully shown. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 173 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>173. Quod per Verbum etiam sit lux illis, qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, et non habent Verbum, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_173/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_104">DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE SCRIPTURA SACRA 104-113</a>, ostensum est: et quia per Verbum est lux homini, et ex luce illi intellectus, et hic tam malis quam bonis est, sequitur quod ex luce in sua origine, sit lux in suis derivationibus, quae sunt perceptiones et cogitationes de quacunque re: dicit Dominus, "Quod sine Ipso <sup>1</sup>nihil possint facere," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_5">Johannes 15:5</a>.

Quod modo unica vita sit, ex qua vita omnibus est, supra ostensum est, ac perceptio et cogitatio est vitae, quare ex eodem fonte, ex quo vita, est quoque perceptio et cogitatio. Quod omnis lux, quae facit intellectum, sit ex Sole Mundi spiritualis, qui est Dominus, multis prius demonstratum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: Ipso<p>2 Prima editio: pater<p>3 Prima editio: datentur, </p>
