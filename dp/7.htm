<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第7节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>7、⑷按照圣治，每一个受造物，无论整体还是部分，都应是这样的一体；它若不是这样，就应变成这样。这意味着，每一个受造物里面都应该有来自神性之爱，同时来自神性智慧的某种东西，或也可说，每一个受造物里面都应该有良善与真理，也就是良善与真理的一个结合。由于良善属于爱，真理属于智慧，如前所述<a href="5.htm">（5节）</a>，所以在下文我们有时会以良善与真理这两个术语来代替爱与智慧，以良善与真理的婚姻来代替爱与智慧的结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 7</h4><p>7. (4) It is a goal of Divine providence that everything created be such a unity, as a whole and in every part, and if it is not, that it become so. That is to say, it is a goal of Divine providence that every created thing have in it something emanating from Divine love and at the same time from Divine wisdom, or to say the same thing, that every created thing have in it goodness and truth, or a union of goodness and truth. <p>Since goodness is connected with love, and truth with wisdom, as we said in no. <a href="5.htm">5</a> above, therefore we shall often hereafter say good and truth instead of love and wisdom, and the marriage of good and truth instead of the union of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 7</h4><p>7. 4. It is the intent of divine providence that everything created, collectively and in every detail, should be this kind of whole, and that if it is not, it should become one. This means that there should be something of divine love and something of divine wisdom together in everything that has been created, or (which amounts to the same thing) something good and something true in everything that has been created--or a union of what is good and what is true. Since what is good is a matter of love and what is true is a matter of wisdom, as I noted in 5 above, throughout the following pages I will be talking about what is good and what is true instead of about love and wisdom, and about the marriage of goodness and truth instead of the union of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 7</h4><p>7. IV. IT IS OF THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE THAT EVERY CREATED THING, BOTH AS A WHOLE AND IN PART, SHOULD BE SUCH A ONE; AND IF IT IS NOT, THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE SO. This means that in every created thing there should be something from the Divine Love and at the same time from the Divine Wisdom; or, what is the same, that in every created thing there should be good and truth, that is, a union of good and truth. Since good is of love and truth is of wisdom, as was said above in n. <a href="5.htm">5</a>, in what follows the terms good and truth will be used throughout instead of love and wisdom, and the marriage of good and truth instead of the union of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 7</h4><p>7. (4) The end of the Divine providence is that every created thing, in general and in particular, shall be such a one; and if it is not, that it shall become such. That is, that in every created thing there shall be something both from the Divine love and from the Divine wisdom; or what is the same, that in every created thing there shall be good and truth, that is, a conjunction of good and truth. Since good is of love and truth is of wisdom (as has been said above,<a href="5.htm">5</a>), in the following pages the terms good and truth will be used throughout instead of love and wisdom, and the marriage of good and truth, instead of the union of love and wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 7 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>7. IV. Quod Divinae Providentiae sit, ut omne creatum in communi et in parte, sit tale unum, et si non est, ut fiat, hoc est, ut in omni creato sit aliquid ex Divino Amore et simul ex Divina Sapientia, seu quod idem, quod in omni creato sit bonum et verum, seu conjunctio boni et veri: quoniam bonum est amoris et verum est sapientiae, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_7/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5">5</a> dictum est, <sup>1</sup>ideo in sequentibus pro amore et sapientia passim dicetur bonum et verum, et pro unione amoris et sapientiae, conjugium boni et veri.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: est; </p>
