<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第171节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>171、⑷人被主通过圣言和基于圣言的教义和讲道教导，因而唯独被主直接教导。前面（155-164节）已阐述并说明，人唯独被主引领和教导，这一切是从天堂，而不是通过天堂，或通过那里的任何天使发生的。由于人唯独被主引领，所以可推知，他是直接而非间接被引领。现在说明这一切是如何发生的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 171</h4><p>171. (4) The Lord teaches a person through the Word and through doctrine and preaching from the Word, and thus directly from Himself alone. We said and showed above that a person is led and taught by the Lord alone, and this from heaven and not through heaven or through any angel there. And because a person is led by the Lord alone, it follows that he is led by Him directly and not indirectly. But how this is the case must now be explained. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 171</h4><p>171. 4. We are taught by the Lord through the Word, an teaching and preaching from the Word, and therefore directly by the Lord alone. It has already been clearly explained [<a href="155.htm">155-164</a>] that we are led and taught by the Lord alone and that this happens from heaven, not through heaven or through any angel there. Since it is only the Lord who leads us, it follows that we are led directly, not indirectly. Now an explanation of how this happens is needed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 171</h4><p>171. IV. MAN IS TAUGHT BY THE LORD BY MEANS OF THE WORD, AND BY DOCTRINE AND PREACHING FROM THE WORD, AND THUS IMMEDIATELY FROM HIMSELF ALONE. It has been said and shown above that man is led and taught by the Lord alone from heaven and not through heaven or through any angel there; and as he is led by the Lord alone, it follows that he is led immediately and not mediately. How this is done will now be described. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 171</h4><p>171. (4) Man is taught by the Lord by means of the Word, and by means of doctrine and preaching from the Word, and thus immediately by the Lord alone. It has been said and shown above that man is led and taught by the Lord alone and this from heaven, and not through heaven or through any angel there; and as he is led by the Lord alone, it follows that he is led immediately and not mediately. How this is done will now be told. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 171 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>171. IV. Quod homo a Domino doceatur per Verbum, doctrinam et praedicationes ex illo, et sic immediate ex Ipso solo. Supra dictum et ostensum est, quod homo a Solo Domino ducatur et doceatur, et quod e Coelo et non per Coelum, aut per aliquem Angelum ibi: et quia a Solo Domino ducitur, sequitur quod immediate et non mediate: sed quomodo hoc fit, nunc dicetur. </p>
