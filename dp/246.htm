<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第246节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>246、⑥继所罗门之后的许多王被允许亵渎圣殿和教会的圣物。这是因为百姓代表教会，他们的王是他们的头；还因为以色列和犹太民族具有这样的性质，他们不能长时间地代表教会。事实上，他们心里是偶像崇拜者。正因如此，他们通过曲解教会的一切事物，直到把教会毁灭而逐渐远离代表性敬拜。这一切由列王对圣殿的亵渎和他们的偶像崇拜来代表；教会的实际毁灭由圣殿本身的摧毁，以及以色列人被掳和犹太人在巴比伦被囚来代表。这就是原因；凡出于某种原因所发生的事都是照着圣治的某条律法在圣治之下发生的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 246</h4><p>246. (6) That many kings after Solomon were allowed to profane the temple and sanctities of the church: This was allowed because the people represented the church, and the king was their head. And because the Israelite and Jewish nation was such that they could not represent the church for long, for they were at heart idolaters, therefore they gradually turned away from their representative worship by perverting everything having to do with the church, until at last they brought about its ruin. This was represented by the kings' profanings of the Temple, and by their idolatries - the final ruination of the church being represented by the destruction of the Temple and by the Israelite people's being carried off and the Jewish people's being taken captive to Babylon. <p>This was the cause, and whatever results from any cause takes place in consequence of Divine providence in accordance with some one of its laws. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 246</h4><p>246. 6. Many of the kings after Solomon were allowed to profane the temple and the holy practices of the church. This was because the people portrayed the church, and the king was their head. It was also because the people of Israel and Judah were a kind of people who could not represent the church for very long. At heart, they were idolaters. Because of this, they gradually drifted away from their representative worship by so misconstruing everything the church stood for that ultimately they destroyed it. This was portrayed by the way the kings profaned the temple and by their idolatry; and the actual ruin of the church was portrayed by the destruction of the temple itself, the carrying off of the people of Israel, and the Babylonian captivity of the people of Judah. <p>That was the reason, and anything that happens for some reason happens under divine providence, under one of its laws. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 246</h4><p>246. 6. Many kings after Solomon were permitted to profane the temple and the holy things of the Church. This was because the people represented the Church and the king was their head. Because the nation of Israel and Judah was such that they could not represent the Church for long as they were idolaters at heart, therefore they gradually departed from representative worship by perverting all things of the Church till at length it was devastated. This was represented by the profanations of the temple by the kings and by their idolatries. The actual devastation of the Church was represented by the destruction of the temple itself and by the carrying away of the people of Israel and by the captivity of the people of Judah in Babylon. Such was the cause of this permission; and whatever is done from any cause is done from the Divine Providence according to one of its laws. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 246</h4><p>246. (6) Many kings after Solomon were permitted to profane the temple and the holy things of the church. This was because the people represented the church, and their king was their head; and as the nation of Israel and Judah was such that they could no longer represent the church, for they were idolaters at heart, they gradually fell away from representative worship by perverting all things of the church, till at last it was devastated. This was represented by the profanations of the temple by the kings, and by their idolatries; and the essential devastation of the church was represented by the destruction of the temple itself, and by the carrying away of the people of Israel, and by the captivity of the people of Judah in Babylonia. Such was the cause; and whatever is done from any cause is done from the Divine providence according to some law of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 246 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>246. VI. Quod permissum sit multis regibus post Salomonem, prophanare <sup>1</sup>Templum et sancta Ecclesiae; erat quia populus repraesentabat Ecclesiam, et Rex caput eorum; et quia Gens Israelitica et Judaica talis erat, ut non diu potuerint repraesentare Ecclesiam, erant enim corde idololatrae, quare successive a cultu repraesentativo recesserunt, pervertendo omnia Ecclesiae, usque ut tandem devastaverint illam; hoc per prophanationes Templi a Regibus, et per idololatrias eorum, repraesentatum est; ipsa devastatio Ecclesiae per ipsius Templi destructionem, perque abductionem populi Israelitici, ac per captivitatem populi Judaici in Babyloniam. Haec fuit causa, et quicquid fit ex aliqua causa, fit ex Divina Providentia secundum aliquam legem ejus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: propbanare </p>
