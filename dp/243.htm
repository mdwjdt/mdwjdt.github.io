<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第243节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>243、③以色列民族在旷野敬拜一只金牛犊，承认它为领他们出埃及地的神；然而，耶和华从附近的西乃山上看到这一切，却不寻求阻止。这事发生在西乃山附近的西乃旷野。耶和华没有制止他们进行这种可憎的敬拜，符合目前所阐述的一切圣治律法，也符合接下来所阐述的圣治律法。允许他们行这恶，是为了避免他们全部灭亡。因为以色列人被领出埃及，是为了他们可以代表主的教会；除非埃及人的偶像崇拜从他们心里被彻底根除，否则他们不可能代表该教会；若不让他们按自己的心意行事，好由此通过严厉的惩罚除去它，这一切不可能实现。关于这种敬拜，以及他们要被彻底弃绝，摩西要兴起一个新民族的威胁进一步表示什么，可参看《属天的奥秘》关于出埃及记32章的讨论（10393-10512节），那里论述了这些主题。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 243</h4><p>243. (3) That in the wilderness the Israelite nation worshiped the golden calf and acknowledged it as the God who had led them out of the land of Egypt, even though Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai nearby and did not act to avert it: This happened in the Sinai desert beside the mountain. The fact that Jehovah did not deter them from that unlawful worship accords with all the laws of Divine providence that we have enumerated so far, and also with those that follow. <p>The people were permitted this evil to keep them from all perishing. For the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt to represent the Lord's church, and they could not represent this unless Egyptian idolatries were first eradicated from their hearts. This in turn could not be accomplished unless they were left to do according to what was in their heart, and so to put that away on being severely punished. <p>What was further symbolized by that worship, and by the threat of their being wholly rejected and a new nation raised up from Moses, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven) in the treatment of <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_32_1.htm">Exodus 32</a> where these points are dealt with. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 243</h4><p>243. 3. The Israelites worshiped a golden calf in the wilderness and acknowledged it as the God who had led them out of the land of Egypt, while God was watching from nearby Mount Sinai and doing nothing to prevent it. This happened in the wilderness of Sinai near the mountain. The fact that Jehovah did not dissuade them from this outrageous worship is in keeping with all the laws of divine providence, both those already mentioned and those that will follow. They were allowed this evil to keep them all from destruction. That is, the Israelites had been led out of Egypt in order to portray the Lord's church, and they could not portray it until Egyptian idolatry had been uprooted from their hearts. This could not be accomplished unless they were given room to act out what was in their hearts and get rid of it because of severe punishment. <p>Further meanings of this worship, including the threat of total rejection and the raising up of a new nation by Moses, may be found in the discussion of Exodus 22 [<a href="32.htm">32</a>] in Secrets of Heaven [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10393.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10393-10512</a>], where these subjects are discussed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 243</h4><p>243. 3. The Israelitish nation worshipped a golden calf in the desert, and acknowledged it as the god which led them out of the land of Egypt. Yet Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai nearby and did not seek to prevent it. This took place in the wilderness of Sinai near the mountain. That Jehovah did not withhold them from that wicked act of idolatry is in accordance with all the laws of the Divine Providence hitherto set forth, and also in accordance with those which follow. This evil was permitted them that they might not all perish. For the Children of Israel were led out of Egypt that they might represent the Lord's Church; and this they could not have done unless Egyptian idolatry had first been rooted out of their hearts. This could not have been done unless it had been left to them to act according to what was in their hearts and so remove it as the result of severe punishment. What further is signified by that worship, and by the threat that they should be wholly rejected and that a new nation should be raised up out of Moses, may be seen in the ARCANA CAELESTIA on Exodus 22 (A.V. 32), where these things are treated of. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 243</h4><p>243. (3) The Israelitish nation worshiped a golden calf in the wilderness and acknowledged it as the God who led them out of the land of Egypt; and yet Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai near by, and did not seek to prevent it. This took place in the desert of Sinai near the mountain. Jehovah's not withholding them from that abominable worship is in accordance with all the laws of the Divine providence heretofore set forth, as well as with those that follow. This evil was permitted them lest they should all perish. For the sons of Israel were led out of Egypt that they might represent the Lord's church; and this they could not represent unless Egyptian idolatry had first been rooted out of their hearts; and this could not have been done without its having been left for them to act in accord with what was in their hearts, that this might thereby be removed by means of severe punishment. What is further signified by that worship, and by the threat that they should be wholly rejected and that a new nation should be raised up by Moses, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia on the thirty-second chapter of Exodus, where these things are treated of. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 243 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>243. III. Quod Gens Israelitica in deserto coluerit vitulum aureum, et agnoverit illum pro Deo, qui illos e terra Aegypti eduxit: cum tamen Jehovah hoc vidit e monte Sinai prope, et non praecavit: factum est hoc in deserto Sinai prope montem: quod Jehovah non abduxerit illos a facinoroso illo cultu, est secundum omnes leges Divinae Providentiae, quae hactenus allatae sunt, et quoque secundum illas quae sequuntur. Hoc malum illis permissum est, ne perirent omnes; nam filii Israelis educti sunt ex Aegypto, ut repraesentarent Ecclesiam Domini, et hanc repraesentare non potuerunt, nisi idololatria Aegyptiaca e cordibus eorum primum eradicaretur; et hoc non fieri potuit nisi relictum fuisset illis agere secundum id quod in corde illorum fuit, et sic auferre illud per gravem punitionem. Quid ulterius per cultum illum; perque comminationem quod plene rejicerentur, et quod nova gens e Mose excitaretur, significatur, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_243/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10392">ARCANIS COELESTIBUS 10392</a> super Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_243/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_32_1-35">32</a>. <sup>1</sup>Exodi, ubi de illis agitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: XXII: </p>
