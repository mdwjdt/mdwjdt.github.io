<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第66节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>66、这一切能使我们在某种程度上明白可被称为天使般的一个奥秘，即：对良善，同时对真理的每种情感，就其形式而言，都是一个人。事实上，凡从主发出之物，因来自祂的神性之爱，所以都是对良善的一种情感，并因来自祂的神性智慧，所以也都是对真理的一种情感。从主发出的对真理的情感作为对真理的一种感知和随之的思维而出现在天使和世人里面，因为人们会注意到感知和思维，很少注意到它们所来自的情感，尽管它们与对真理的情感作为一体从主发出。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 66</h4><p>66. One can in some measure see from this the following secret, which may be called an angelic secret, that every affection for good and at the same time for truth is in its form human. For whatever emanates from the Lord derives from His Divine love the characteristic of being an affection for good, and from His Divine wisdom the characteristic being an affection for truth. <p>An affection for truth that emanates from the Lord appears in an angel or person as a perception and consequent thought of truth, because attention is paid to the perception and thought, and little to the affection from which they spring, even though they emanate together with the affection for truth as a single entity from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 66</h4><p>66. This enables us to understand to some extent a mystery we can call angelic, namely, that every desire for what is both good and true is human as to its form. That is, whatever emanates from the Lord is a desire for what is good because it comes from his divine love and is a desire for what is true because it comes from his divine wisdom. In angels and in us, the desire for what is true that emanates from the Lord seems like a perception of what is true and like thought about it because we are attentive to perception and thought and not particularly attentive to the desire that they come from, even though [the perception and thought] emanate from the Lord as integral to the desire for what is true. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 66</h4><p>66. From these considerations this interior truth, which may be termed angelic, can in some measure be seen, namely, that every affection of good and at the same time of truth is in its form a man; for whatever proceeds from the Lord is, by its derivation from His Divine Love, an affection of good and, by its derivation from His Divine Wisdom, an affection of truth. The affection of truth which proceeds from the Lord appears in an angel and in man as a perception and consequent thought of truth, because attention is given to the perception and thought, and but little attention to the affection from which these spring, although they proceed from the Lord as one with the affection of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 66</h4><p>66. From all this the arcanum, which may be called angelic, can in some measure be seen, namely, that every affection for good and at the same time for truth is in its form a man; for whatever goes forth from the Lord, by its derivation from His Divine love is an affection for good, and by its derivation from His Divine wisdom is an affection for truth. The affection for truth that goes forth from the Lord appears in angel and in man as a perception and consequent thought of truth, for the reason that attention is given to the perception and thought, and little to the affection from which these spring, although they go forth from the Lord as one with affection for truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 66 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>66. Ex his hoc arcanum, quod vocari potest angelicum, aliquatenus videri potest, quod unaquaevis affectio boni et simul veri sit in sua forma homo; nam quicquid procedit a Domino, trahit ex Divino Amore Ipsius quod sit affectio boni, et ex Divina Sapientia Ipsius quod sit affectio veri. Affectio veri, quae procedit a Domino, apparet ut perceptio et inde cogitatio veri in angelo et in homine, ex causa quia ad perceptionem et cogitationem attenditur, et parum ad affectionem ex qua, quae tamen cum affectione veri ut unum a Domino procedunt. </p>
