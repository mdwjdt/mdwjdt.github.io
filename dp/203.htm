<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第203节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>203、因此，既然每个人死后都会活到永远，并照他的生命要么在天堂，要么在地狱被分配一个地方，既然天堂和地狱都必须存在于一个使它们行如一体的形式中，如前所述，既然人只能在这个形式中被分配到自己的地方，那么可推知，整个世界的人类都在主的看顾之下；每个人，从婴孩直到生命结束，在最细微的事上都被主引导，并拥有一个已预见并准备好的特定地方。<p>由此可见，主的圣治是普遍的，因为它在最小的细节中，这就是主通过创造宇宙而为自己所提供的无限和永恒的创造。人对这种普遍圣治一无所见，即便看见了，在他眼里，它也只是像一个过路人看见房子在建造时散落的一堆堆建筑材料；而主看见的，却是一座宏伟的宫殿正在不断扩建。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 203</h4><p>203. So then, since every person lives after death to eternity and in accordance with his life is allotted a place either in heaven or in hell, and both heaven and hell must exist in a form which functions as a unit, as said before, and since no one can be allotted any other place in that form but his own, it follows that the human race throughout the whole world is under the Lord's care, that the Lord guides everyone in the least particulars from infancy to the end of his life, and that the Lord foresees his place and at the same time provides it.</p><p>[2] Consequently it is apparent that the Lord's Divine providence is universal because it operates in the least particulars, and that this is an infinite and eternal creating, which the Lord has provided for Himself by the creation of the universe. <p>A person sees nothing of this universal providence, and if he were to see it, it could appear to his eyes only as do scattered heaps and assembled piles of materials to passers-by, the materials out of which a house is to be built. But to the Lord it appears as a magnificent palace constantly being built and enlarged. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 203</h4><p>203. Since we all live forever after death, then, and are assigned places either in heaven or in hell depending on how we have lived, and since both heaven and hell are necessarily in a form that causes them to act as unities (as already noted [<a href="124.htm">124</a>]), and since none of us can be assigned to any place in that form except our own, it follows that the human race throughout the whole world is under the Lord's supervision, and that each one of us is being led by him in the slightest details, from infancy to the end of life, with a particular place foreseen and provided for.</p><p>[2] We can see from this that divine providence is universal because it attends to the slightest details, and that it is an infinite and eternal creation that the Lord has provided for himself by creating the universe. <p>We see nothing of this universal providence, and if we did see it, it would look to our sight like the scattered piles and random heaps that passers-by see when a house is being built. The Lord, though, sees a magnificent palace constantly under construction and constantly being enlarged. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 203</h4><p>203. Since, therefore, every man after death lives for ever, and according to his life here has a place assigned to him either in heaven or in hell, and since both heaven and hell must exist in such a form as will act as one, as was said before; and since no one can be assigned in that form any place but his own, it follows that the human race throughout the whole world is under the guidance of the Lord, and that everyone from infancy even to the end of his life is led by Him in the most individual things and his place foreseen and also provided.</p><p>[2] From these things it is clear that the Divine Providence of the Lord is universal because it is in the most individual things; and that this is the infinite and eternal creation which the Lord provided for Himself by means of the creation of the universe. Man does not see anything of this universal providence; and if he did, it could not appear to him otherwise than as passers-by see the scattered heaps and collections of materials from which a house is to be built; while the Lord sees it as a magnificent palace with its work of construction and enlargement continually going on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 203</h4><p>203. Since, therefore, every man lives for ever after death, and is allotted a place according to his life, either in heaven or in hell, and since both heaven and hell must exist in a form that will act as a one, as said before, and since no one can be allotted in that form any place but his own, it follows that the human race throughout the whole world is under the Lord's auspices; and that each one, from infancy even to the end of his life, is led by the Lord in the least particulars, and his place foreseen and at the same time provided.</p><p>[2] From all this it is clear that the Lord's Divine providence is universal because it is in every least particular; and that this is the infinite and eternal creation which the Lord provided for Himself by means of the creation of the universe. Of this universal providence man sees nothing. If he did see it it would appear in his eyes only as one passing sees scattered heaps and accumulated material from which a house is to be built, while the Lord sees it as a magnificent palace, with its work of construction and enlargement constantly going on. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 203 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>203. Cum itaque omnis homo post mortem vivit in aeternum, et secundum vitam suam sortitur locum vel in Coelo vel in Inferno, ac utrumque tam Coelum quam Infernum, erit in forma, quae ut unum aget, ut prius dictum est; et nemo in illa forma alium locum potest sortiri, quam suum; sequitur quod Genus humanum in toto terrarum orbe sit sub auspicio Domini, et unusquisque ab infantia usque ad vitae suae finem in singularissimis ab Ipso ducatur, ac praevideatur et simul provideatur locus ejus.</p><p>[2] Ex quibus patet, quod Divina Domini Providentia sit universalis quia est in singularissimis; et quod hoc sit infinita ac aeterna Creatio, quam Dominus Sibi providit per Creationem universi. De hac universali Providentia homo non videt aliquid, et si videret, illa non potest aliter apparere coram oculis ejus, quam sicut praetereuntibus <sup>1</sup>apparent sparsi acervi et congestae strues, ex quibus formanda est domus; at Domino <sup>2</sup>sicut magnificum Palatium jugiter in sua constructione, et in sua amplificatione.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: a praetereuntibus<p>2 Prima editio: a Domino </p>
