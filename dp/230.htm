<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第230节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>230、对圣物的亵渎就是十诫中的第二诫所提到的，即：“不可亵渎神的名”。主祷文中“愿人都尊你的名为圣”这句话表示，决不可亵渎这个名。在基督教界，几乎没有人知道何谓“神的名”，因为没有人知道灵界没有像自然界那样的名字，那里的每个人都照着自己的爱与智慧的品质而拥有一个名字。一旦有人进入一个社群或一群人当中，他就立刻被赋予一个表明他性质的名字。这种起名是通过属灵的语言实现的，这种语言具有这种性质：它能命名一切事物，因为字母表中的每个字母都表示一个事物，当多个字母组合成一个词，如组合成一个人的名字时，这些字母就包括了该对象的整个状态。这是灵界的奇事之一。<p>由此清楚可知，在圣言中，“神的名”表示神，以及在祂里面并从祂发出的一切事物。由于圣言是神性发出，也就是神的名，并且被称为教会属灵事物的一切神性事物都来自圣言，所以它们也是“神的名”。这一切清楚表明，十诫中的第二诫，即“不可亵渎神的名”<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_7.htm">（出埃及记 20:7）</a>是什么意思，主祷文中“愿人都尊你的名为圣”<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_9.htm">（马太福音6:9）</a>又是什么意思。在新旧约的许多地方，“神的名”和“主的名”，其含义都差不多<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">（如马太福音7:22</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_22.htm">10:22</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_5.htm">18:5</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_29.htm">19:29</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_9.htm">21:9</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9-10</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">约翰福音1:12</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_23.htm">2:23</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">3:17-18</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_13.htm">12:13</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_28.htm">28</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_14.htm">14:14-16</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_23.htm">16:23-24</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_26.htm">26-27</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_6.htm">17:6</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">20:31等等；以及旧约中的许多地方）</a>。<p>人若知道这“名”的含义，就能明白主的这些话表示什么：<p>人因为先知的名接待先知，必得先知的赏赐；人因为义人的名接待义人，必得义人的赏赐。无论何人，因为门徒的名，只把一杯凉水给这小子里的一个喝，我实在告诉你们，这人必不失他的赏赐。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_41.htm">（马太福音10:41-42）</a><p>人若认为“先知的名”、“义人的名”和“门徒的名”在此仅仅是指一个先知，一个义人和一个门徒，就只能认识字义。他也不知道什么叫“先知的赏赐”，或“义人的赏赐”，或给一个门徒一杯凉水所得的“赏赐”。然而，先知的“名”和“赏赐”表示那些处于神性真理之人的状态和幸福；义人的“名”和“赏赐”表示那些处于神性良善之人的状态和幸福；“一个门徒”表示那些处于教会的一些属灵事物之人的状态；“一杯凉水”表示真理的某种东西。<p>“名”表示爱与智慧，或良善与真理的状态的性质，这一点从主的这些话明显看出来：<p>从门进去的，才是羊的牧人；看门的就给他开门，羊也听他的声音。他按着名叫自己的羊，领它们出来。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">（约翰福音10:2-3）</a><p>“按名叫羊”表示教导并引领凡照着自己爱与智慧的状态而处于仁之良善的人。“门”表示主，这从第9节经文明显看出来：<p>我就是门；凡从我进来的，必然得救。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_9.htm">（约翰福音10:9）</a><p>这一切清楚表明，人若要得救，必须靠近主自己；凡转向祂的，就是“羊的牧人”；凡不转向祂的，就是“贼和强盗”，如约翰福音（10:1）所说的那样。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 230</h4><p>230. Profanation of the sacred is meant in the second commandment of the Decalogue by the declaration, "You shall not profane the name of your God." And that His name is not to be profaned is meant in the Lord's Prayer by the phrase, "Hallowed be Your name." <p>Scarcely anyone in the Christian world knows what is meant by the name of God. That is because no one knows that people in the spiritual world do not have names as they do in the natural world, but that everyone is named according to the character of his love and wisdom. For as soon as someone enters into a society or into a companionship with others, he is immediately named in accordance with his character there. <p>The naming is made in spiritual language, which is such that it can provide a name for everything, because every letter in the alphabet there has a particular symbolic meaning, and several letters combined into a whole word, as to form a person's name, encompass the whole state of a thing. This is one of the marvels found in the spiritual world.</p><p>[2] It is apparent from this that in the Word God is symbolically meant by the name of God, with every Divine attribute residing in Him and emanating from Him. Moreover, because the Word is the Divinity emanating, it is the name of God. And because all Divine matters that are called the spiritual concerns of the church come from the Word, they too are the name of God. <p>It can be seen from this what is meant in the second commandment of the Decalogue by the declaration, "You shall not profane the name of... God," and in the Lord's Prayer by the phrase, "Hallowed be Your name." <p>Like things are symbolically meant by the name of God and of the Lord in many places in the Word of both Testaments, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_22.htm">10:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_5.htm">18:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_29.htm">19:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_9.htm">21:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_23.htm">2:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">3:17-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_13.htm">12:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_28.htm">28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_13.htm">14:13-14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_16.htm">15:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_23.htm">16:23-24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_26.htm">26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_6.htm">17:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">20:31</a>. In other places as well, and frequently in the Old Testament.</p><p>[3] One who knows this symbolic meaning of the word "name" can know what is symbolically meant by these words of the Lord: <p>Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. ...Whoever receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whoever gives one of these little ones to drink a drink of cold water only in the name of a disciple... shall not lose his reward. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_41.htm">Matthew 10:41-42</a>) <p>Anyone who interprets the name of a prophet, righteous man, or disciple to mean here only a prophet, righteous man, or disciple does not know any other level of meaning in the statement than simply the sense of the letter, and he does not know either what a prophet's reward is, a righteous man's reward, or the reward of a disciple for giving a drink of cold water. Yet in fact by the name and reward of a prophet are meant the state and happiness of people governed by Divine truths, by the name and reward of a righteous man the state and happiness of people governed by Divine goods, and by a disciple the state of people governed by some spiritual concerns of the church - a drink of cold water meaning some measure of truth.</p><p>[4] That the word "name" symbolically means the nature of a state of love and wisdom or of goodness and truth is shown also by these words of the Lord: <p>He who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">John 10:2-3</a>) <p>To call the sheep by name is to teach and lead everyone impelled by the good of charity in accordance with the state of his love and wisdom. By the door is meant the Lord, as is apparent from verse 9 there: <p>I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>) <p>From this it is apparent that the Lord Himself must be approached for one to be saved, and anyone who does approach Him is a shepherd of the sheep. But one who does not approach Him is a thief and a robber, as said in the first verse of that chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 230</h4><p>230. The profanation of what is holy is referred to in the second of the Ten Commandments in the words, "You shall not profane the name of your God" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_5_11.htm">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>]; and the Lord's prayer is telling us that we must not profane what is holy when it says, "Hallowed be your name" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>]. Hardly anyone in all Christendom knows what "the name of God" means. This is because people do not know that people in the spiritual world do not have names the way we do in this physical world. Rather, each individual is named for her or his own love and wisdom. As soon as we enter a community or a gathering of people, we are immediately given a name that expresses our nature. We are named in a spiritual language that is essentially able to give a distinctive name to every individual thing, because every letter in its alphabet means something definite; and when many letters are combined into a single word, as happens with an individual's name, they include the whole state of that object. This is just one of the marvels of the spiritual world.</p><p>[2] We can see from this that in the Word, "the name of God" means both God and everything divine that is in him and that emanates from him. Since the Word is a divine emanation, it is a name of God; and since all the divine gifts that we refer to as the spiritual gifts of the church come from the Word, they too are a name of God. <p>This enables us to see what "You shall not profane the name of your God" means in the second of the Ten Commandments, and what "Hallowed be your name" means in the Lord's Prayer. <p>"The name of God" and "the name of the Lord" mean much the same in many passages in the Word in both Testaments. See, for example, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_5.htm">Matthew 18:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_9.htm">Matthew 24:9-10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_23.htm">John 2:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_13.htm">John 12:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_28.htm">28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_14.htm">John 14:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_16.htm">16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_23.htm">John 16:23-24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_26.htm">26-27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_6.htm">John 17:6</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>, among others, as well as a great many in the Old Testament.</p><p>[3] If you know the meaning of this "name," then you can know the meaning of the Lord's words, "Whoever accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. Whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward; and whoever gives one of these little ones something cold to drink in the name of a disciple will not lose the reward" (Matthew 10:21 [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_41.htm">Matthew 10:41-42</a>]). If you understand the name of a prophet or a righteous person or a disciple to mean nothing but the prophet or the righteous person or the disciple, then the only meaning you get will be a literal one. You will not know, either, what is meant by the reward of the prophet or the reward of the righteous person or the reward for the cold drink given on behalf of the disciple. Yet the name and the reward of the prophet mean the blessed state of people who enjoy divine gifts of truth, and the name and the reward of the righteous person mean the blessed state of people who enjoy divine gifts of what is good, while the disciple means the state of people who have some of the spiritual gifts of the church, and the cold drink is any element of truth.</p><p>[4] We can also tell that the name means the nature of the state of love and wisdom, or of what is good and true, from these words of the Lord: "The one who comes in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. The doorkeeper opens to him and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out" (Matthew 10:2, 3 [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">John 10:2-3</a>]). "Calling sheep by name" is teaching and leading every individual whose deeds are prompted by caring, and doing so in keeping with that individual's state of love and wisdom. "The door" means the Lord, as we can tell from verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>: "I am the door. Anyone who enters in by me will be saved." This shows that we need to turn to the Lord himself if we are to be saved, and that the one who does turn to him is a shepherd of his sheep. Anyone who does not turn to him is a thief and a robber, as it says in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_1.htm">first</a> verse of the same chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 230</h4><p>230. The profanation of what is holy is meant in the second commandment of the Decalogue, "Thou shalt not profane the name of thy God"; and that it ought not to be profaned is meant by these words in the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be thy name." Scarcely anyone in the Christian world knows what is meant by the name of God. The reason why this is not known is that in the spiritual world names are not as in the natural world, but everyone has a name according to the quality of his love and wisdom; for as soon as anyone enters a society or into association with others he is named there according to his character. This naming is effected by spiritual language, which is such that it can give a name to everything, because there each letter signifies one thing and the letters combined into one word, forming a person's name, include the entire state of what is named. This is one of the wonderful things of the spiritual world.</p><p>[2] Hence it is clear that by the name of God in the Word is signified God with all the Divine that is in Him and that proceeds from Him; and as the Word is the Divine proceeding, it is the name of God; and as all the Divine things which are called the spiritual things of the Church are from the Word, they, too, are the name of God. From these considerations it may be seen what is meant in the second commandment of the Decalogue by "Thou shalt not profane (A.V. take in vain) the name of God (A.V. the name of the Lord thy God)." <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; and in the Lord's Prayer by Hallowed be thy name. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>.<p>The name of God and of the Lord has a like signification <sup>1</sup>in many places in the Word of both Testaments, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_22.htm">10:22</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_5.htm">18:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_29.htm">19:29</a>;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_9.htm">21:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9-10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_23.htm">2:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">3:17-18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_13.htm">12:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_28.htm">12:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_14.htm">John 14:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_16.htm">16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_23.htm">16:23-24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_26.htm">16:26-27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">20:31</a>; besides in other places, and in very many places in the Old Testament.</p><p>[3] He who knows this signification of name may understand what is signified by these words of the Lord:<p>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<p>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple ... shall in no wise lose his reward. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_21.htm">Matthew 10:21</a> (A.V. 41, 42).<p>He who by the name of a prophet, of a righteous man, and of a disciple here understands only a prophet, a righteous man and a disciple does not know in that passage any other sense than only the sense of the Letter. He does not know what is signified by the reward of a prophet, or by the reward of a just man, or by the reward for a cup of cold water given to a disciple; when yet by the name and the reward of a prophet is meant the state and the happiness of those who are in Divine truths; by the name and the reward of a righteous man is meant the state and the happiness of those who are in Divine goods; by a disciple is meant the state of those who are in some of the spiritual things of the Church; and by a cup of cold water is meant something of truth.</p><p>[4] That the nature of the state of love and wisdom, or of good and truth, is signified by name is also made evident by these words of the Lord:<p>He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">John 10:2-3</a>.<p>To call his sheep by name is to teach and lead everyone who is in the good of charity according to the state of his love and wisdom. By the door is meant the Lord, as is evident from the ninth verse,<p>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>.<p>From this it is clear that the Lord Himself must be approached in order that anyone may be saved; and that he who approaches Him is a shepherd of the sheep; and that he who does not approach Him is a thief and a robber, as is said in the first verse of this chapter.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Original Edition has "similia . . . significatur." </p>

The profanation of what is holy is referred to in the second commandment of the Decalogue, "Thou shalt not profane the name of thy God." And the words in the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be Thy name," mean that this name must not be profaned. Scarcely any one in the Christian world knows what is meant by "the name of God," and for the reason that no one knows that there are no names in the spiritual world like those in the natural world, but each one there has a name that is in accordance with the quality of his love and wisdom; for as soon as any one enters a society or into association with others, he immediately receives a name that is in accord with his character there. This naming is effected by spiritual language, which is such that it is capable of naming every thing; for each letter in its alphabet signifies a single thing, and the several letters joined into a single word and making a person's name involve the entire state of the thing. This is one of the wonders of the spiritual world.</p><p>[2] From all this it is clear that in the Word "the name of God" signifies God with every thing that is in Him and that goes forth from Him And as the Word is the Divine going forth, which is the name of God, and as all the Divine things that are called the spiritual things of the church are from the Word, they, too, are "the name of God." All this makes clear what is meant in the second commandment of the Decalogue:- <p>Thou shalt not profane the name of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>); <p>and in the Lord's Prayer by <p>Hallowed be Thy name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>). <p>The name of God and of the Lord has a like signification in many places in the Word of both Testaments, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_22.htm">10:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_5.htm">18:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_29.htm">19:29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_9.htm">21:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9-10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_23.htm">2:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">3:17-18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_13.htm">12:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_28.htm">28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_14.htm">14:14-16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_23.htm">16:23-24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_26.htm">26-27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_31.htm">20:31</a>; besides other places; and very frequently in the Old Testament.</p><p>[3] He who knows that this is what is signified by "name" can understand what is signified by these words of the Lord:- <p>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple shall not lose his reward (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_41.htm">Matthew 10:41-42</a>). <p>One who thinks that "the name of a prophet," "of a righteous man," and "of a disciple," here means simply a prophet, a righteous man, and a disciple, recognizes no meaning except that of the letter; nor does he know what "the reward of a prophet" is, or the reward of "a righteous man," or the "reward" for a cup of cold water given to a disciple; nevertheless "the name" and "the reward of a prophet" mean the state and the happiness of those who are in Divine truths; "the name" and "the reward of a righteous man" mean the state and the happiness of those who are in Divine goods; a "disciple" means the state of those who are in some of the spiritual things of the church; and "a cup of cold water" means something of truth.</p><p>[4] That "name" signifies the nature of the state of love and wisdom, or of good and truth, is made evident also by these words of the Lord:- <p>He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep; to him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">John 10:2-3</a>). <p>"To call the sheep by name" means to teach and to lead every one who is in the good of charity according to the state of his love and wisdom. "The door" means the Lord, as is evident from the ninth verse:- <p>I am the door; through Me if any one enter in he shall be saved. <p>All this makes clear that for any one to be saved the Lord Himself must be approached, and that whoever goes to Him is "a shepherd of the sheep;" but whoever does not go to Him is "a thief and a robber," as is said in the first verse of the same chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 230 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>230. Prophanatio sancti intelligitur in Secundo Praecepto decalogi per NON PROPHANABIS NOMEN DEI TUI: et quod non prophanandum sit, intelligitur in Oratione Dominica, per SANCTIFICETUR NOMEN TUUM: quid per Nomen Dei intelligitur, vix ab ullo in Christiano Orbe scitur: causa est, quia non scitur, <sup>1</sup>quod in spirituali Mundo non sint nomina sicut in naturali Mundo, sed quod unusquisque nominetur secundum quale amoris et sapientiae ejus; ut primum enim aliquis venit in societatem aut consortium cum aliis, nominatur illico secundum quale ejus ibi: nominatio fit per linguam spiritualem, quae talis est, ut nomen dare possit unicuique rei, quia ibi quaevis litera in alphabeto unam rem significat, et plures literae in unam vocem conjunctae, quae faciunt nomen personae, integrum statum rei involvunt: hoc inter mirabilia est in Mundo spirituali.</p><p>[2] Ex his patet, quod per Nomen Dei in Verbo significetur Deus cum omni Divino quod in Ipso est, et quod ex Ipso procedit; et quia Verbum est Divinum procedens, est id Nomen Dei; et quia omnia Divina, quae spiritualia Ecclesiae vocantur, ex Verbo sunt, etiam illa sunt Nomen Dei.
