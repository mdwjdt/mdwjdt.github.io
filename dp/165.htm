<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第165节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>165、⑶人被主通过流注引领，通过光照教导。人被主通过流注引领，因为引领和流注关系到爱和意愿；人被主通过光照教导，因为教导和光照关系到智慧和理解力。众所周知，每个人都基于自己的爱被自己引领，并照着他的爱被其他人引领，而不是被他的理解力引领。只有当他的爱或意愿形成他的理解力时，他才被他的理解力并照着它引领；这一步完成之后，可以说他的理解力在引领；而事实上，不是理解力在引领，而是形成它的意愿在引领。采用“流注”这个词，是因为人们习惯说灵魂流入身体；并且如前所示，流注是属灵的，而非物质的，一个人的灵魂或生命就是他的爱或意愿；还因为流注比较像血液进入心脏，并从心脏进入肺脏的流注。《圣爱与圣智》一书<a href="../dlw/371.htm">（371-432节）</a>已说明：心脏与意愿并肺脏与理解力之间存在一种对应关系，意愿与理解力的结合就像血液从心脏进入肺脏的流注。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 165</h4><p>165. (3) The Lord leads a person by influx and teaches him by enlightenment. The Lord leads a person by influx because to be led and also to flow in are expressions applied to love and the will; and He teaches a person by enlightenment because to be taught and to be enlightened are properly expressions applied to wisdom and the intellect. <p>People know that every person is led of himself by his love, and by other people in accordance with it, and not by his intellect. He is led by his intellect and in accordance with it only when his love or will forms it; and when this is the case, it can be said also of the intellect that it is led, though even then it is not the intellect that is led, but the will from which it springs. <p>We use the term influx, because it is an accepted practice to say that the soul flows into the body, and that the influx is spiritual and not physical; and a person's soul or life is his love or will, as we have previously shown. Moreover, the influx is comparatively like the influx of blood into the heart, and from the heart into the lungs. There exists a correspondence of the heart with the will, and of the lungs with the intellect, and the conjunction of the will with the intellect is like the influx of blood from the heart into the lungs, as we have shown in our treatise <a href="../dlw/371.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 371-432</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 165</h4><p>165. 3. We are led by the Lord through an inflow and taught by being enlightened. The reason we are led by the Lord through an inflow is that both the being led and the flowing in are connected to our love and volition. The reason we are taught by the Lord by being enlightened is that being taught and being enlightened are properly connected with our wisdom and discernment. It is common knowledge that we lead ourselves on the basis of our love, and are led by others within the limits of that love, rather than being led by our discernment. We are led by and according to our discernment only as the love of our volition makes it happen; and when this is the case, we might describe our discernment as being led, though in fact it is not really our discernment that is being led but the volition that underlies it. <p>We use the word "inflow" because the standard practice is to say that the soul flows into the body and that the inflow is spiritual and not physical. Our soul or life is our love or volition, as already noted. We use the word also because the inflow is much like the flow of blood into the heart and from the heart into the lungs. I have explained in <a href="../dlw/371.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 371-432</a> that there is a correspondence of the heart with our volition and of the lungs with our discernment, and that the union of volition and discernment is like the flow of blood from the heart into the lungs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 165</h4><p>165. III. MAN IS LED BY THE LORD BY MEANS OF INFLUX, AND TAUGHT BY MEANS OF ENLIGHTENMENT. Man is led by the Lord by means of influx because being led and inflowing are predicated of love and the will; and he is taught by the Lord by means of enlightenment because being taught and enlightened are properly predicated of wisdom and the understanding. It is well known that every man is led by himself from his own love, and by others according to his love, and not by his understanding. He is led by his understanding and according to it, only when his love or his will forms his understanding; and when this is done, it can also be said of his understanding that it is led; but even then it is not the understanding that is being led, but the will from which it is formed.<p>The term influx is used because it is customary to say that the soul flows into the body; and it has been shown above that influx is spiritual and not physical; and a man's soul or life is his love or will. The term is used also because influx is comparatively like the flow of the blood into the heart, and from the heart into the lungs. It has been shown in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM (n. <a href="../dlw/371.htm">371-432</a>), that there is a correspondence of the heart with the will, and of the lungs with the understanding, and that the conjunction of the will with the understanding is like the inflow of the blood from the heart into the lungs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 165</h4><p>165. (3) Man is led by the Lord by means of influx, and taught by means of enlightenment. Man is led by the Lord by means of influx, for leading and inflowing are predicated of the love and the will; and man is taught by the Lord by means of enlightenment, because teaching and enlightening are predicated only of wisdom and the understanding. It is admitted that every man is led by himself from his love, and by others according to his love, and not by his understanding. He is led by his understanding and in accordance with it only when his love or will forms his understanding; and when this is done the understanding may also be said to be led; yet even then it is not the understanding that is led, but the will from which it is. The term influx is used, because it is a common saying that the soul flows into the body; also, as has been shown above, that influx is spiritual and not physical, and a man's soul or life is his love or will; also, because influx is relatively like the inflow of the blood into the heart, and from the heart into the lungs. That there is a correspondence of the heart with the will, and of the lungs with the understanding, and that the conjunction of the will with the understanding is like the inflow of the blood from the heart into the lungs, has been shown in <a href="../dlw/371.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 371-432</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 165 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>165. III. Quod homo a Domino ducatur per <sup>1</sup>influxum, et doceatur per illustrationem. Quod homo a Domino ducatur per influxum, est quia duci et quoque influere dicuntur de amore et voluntate; et quod homo a Domino doceatur per illustrationem, est quia doceri et illustrari proprie dicuntur de sapientia et intellectu: quod omnis homo ducatur ex suo amore a se, et secundum illum ab aliis, et non ab intellectu, notum est; ducitur ab intellectu et secundum illum, modo cum amor seu voluntas illum facit, quod cum fit, etiam dici potest de intellectu quod ducatur, sed usque tunc non ducitur intellectus, sed voluntas ex qua est. Influxus dicitur, quia usu receptum est dicere, quod anima influat in corpus, et quod influxus spiritualis et non physicus sit, et anima seu vita hominis est ejus amor seu voluntas, ut prius ostensum est: tum quia influxus est comparative sicut est influxus sanguinis in cor, et e corde in pulmonem; quod correspondentia sit cordis cum voluntate, ac pulmonis cum intellectu, et quod conjunctio voluntatis cum intellectu sit sicut influxus sanguinis <sup>2</sup>e corde in pulmonem, in Transactione <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_165/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_371">de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA 371-432</a>, ostensum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: pet<p>2 Prima editio: sangvinis </p>
