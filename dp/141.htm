<h4 align="center"></h4><p>141、没有人在不健康的精神状态下被改造，因为这些状态会夺去理性，因而夺去照理性行动的自由。事实上，心智可能是病态的，不健全的；健全的心智是理性的，而病态的心智是非理性的。这种不健康的精神状态就是忧郁，虚假或错误的良心，各种幻觉，不幸所带来的心灵悲伤，以及因身体受损所产生的焦虑和精神痛苦。这些现象有时会被误认为试探，其实不是。因为真正的试探以属灵事物为对象，在此期间心智是明智的；但这些状态以属世事物为对象，在此期间心智是不健康的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 141</h4><p>141. States of mental illness: No one is reformed in a state of mental illness because mental illness takes away rationality and so the freedom of acting in accordance with reason. For the mind is ill and unsound, and it is a sound mind that is rational, not an ill one. <p>Such illnesses are ones of melancholy, of spurious and false conscience, of various types of delusion, of grief of heart arising from misfortunes, of distress and mental anguish owing to some physical disorder - conditions which are sometimes regarded as temptations, but are not. For genuine temptations have spiritual matters as their subjects, and in those the mind is wise. But these illnesses have natural matters as their subjects, and in them the mind is irrational. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 141</h4><p>141. The reason no one is reformed in a state of mental illness is that mental illness deprives us of rationality and therefore of the freedom to act rationally. The mind is sick and not healthy, and while a healthy mind is rational, a sick one is not. The illnesses are things like depression, imagined or illusory guilt, various kinds of hallucinations, mental anguish brought on by misfortunes, and mental anxiety and pain brought on by physical disorders. These are sometimes thought of as temptations, but they are not. Real temptations focus on spiritual issues, and during them the mind is in possession of its skills. The states I am talking about focus on earthly issues, and during them the mind goes mad. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 141</h4><p>141. No one is reformed in a state of mental disorder (animus), because disease of the mind takes away rationality, and consequently freedom of acting according to reason. For the mind (mens) is sick and unsound, and a sound mind is rational but not a sick one. Such disorders of the mind are melancholy, spurious and false remorse of conscience, hallucinations of various kinds, grief of mind (animus) arising from misfortunes, anxieties and mental anguish from a vitiated condition of the body. These are sometimes regarded as temptations, but they are not; for genuine temptations have as their objects spiritual things, and in them the mind is wise; but these states have as their objects natural things, and in them the mind is unsound. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 141</h4><p>141. No one is reformed in unhealthy mental states, because these take away rationality, and consequently the freedom to act in accordance with reason. For the mind may be sick and unsound; and while a sound mind is rational a sick mind is not. Such unhealthy mental states are melancholy, a spurious or false conscience, hallucinations of various kinds, grief of mind from misfortunes, and anxieties and mental suffering from a vitiated condition of the body. These are sometimes regarded as temptations, but they are not. For genuine temptations have as their objects things spiritual, and in these the mind is wise; but these states have as their objects natural things, and in these the mind is unhealthy. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 141 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>141. Quod nemo reformetur in STATU AEGRITUDINIS ANIMI, est quia aegritudo animi tollit rationalitatem, et inde liberum agendi secundum rationem; est enim mens aegra et non sana, et mens sana est rationalis, non autem mens aegra. Tales aegritudines sunt melancholiae, conscientiae spuriae et falsae, phantasiae varii generis, dolores animi ex infortuniis, anxietates et angores mentis ex vitio corporis, quae quandoque reputantur pro tentationibus, sed non sunt; quia genuinae tentationes pro objectis habent spiritualia, et in his mens sapit, at illae pro objectis habent naturalia, et in his mens insanit. </p>
