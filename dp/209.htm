<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第209节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>209、值得注意的是，当天堂向这种人打开，他们被告知，他们是疯狂的，并且这种疯狂也通过流注和光照而清楚显明给他们的感知时，他们却感觉受到了侮辱，并向自己关闭天堂，注视地面，而地面之下就是地狱。这种情形就发生在灵界那些尚在地狱之外，但具有这种性质的人身上。这表明那些认为“我要是看见天堂，听见天使与我交谈，就会承认”的人犯了何等错误。他们的理解力可能会承认；然而，如果他们的意愿不承认，或不同意，他们自己就不会承认。因为意愿的爱将凡它想要的都吹入理解力，反过来不行。事实上，爱会摧毁理解力中凡不是来自它自己的一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 209</h4><p>209. Surprisingly, when heaven is opened to people of this character and they are told they are insane, and this is also made evident to their absolute perception, which is accomplished by influx and enlightenment, still, despite this, with ire they close off heaven to themselves and look to the earth, beneath which is hell. <p>This is the case with people in the spiritual world who are not as yet in hell and are of such a character. Apparent therefore is the error of those who think, "If I saw heaven and heard angels speaking with me, I would acknowledge." However, if their intellect acknowledges, but not at the same time their will, they still do not acknowledge. For the will's love inspires into the intellect whatever it will, and not the reverse. Indeed, it destroys everything in the intellect that does not spring from itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 209</h4><p>209. The striking fact is that when heaven is opened to people like this and they are told that they are out of their minds and even shown this with utter clarity (which is done by inflow and enlightenment), they feel insulted, close heaven to themselves, and look at the ground under which hell lies. This happens to people in the spiritual world who are still outside of hell but who are of this nature. It shows the error of people who think, "If I see heaven and hear angels talking with me, then I will believe." However, while their discernment might believe, if their volition does not concur, then they themselves do not believe. This is because our volition's love breathes into discernment whatever it wants to, not the other way around. In fact, our love erases anything in our discernment that it has not put there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 209</h4><p>209. It is a remarkable thing that when heaven is opened to spirits of this nature, and they are told that they are spiritually insane, and when this is also made evident to their perception by influx and enlightenment, they still, out of indignation, shut heaven against themselves and look to the earth, under which is hell. This happens with such spirits in the spiritual world who are still outside of hell. From this it is clear how mistaken they are who think, "When I have seen heaven and heard angels talking with me, then I shall acknowledge." Their understanding acknowledges; but if the will does not at the same time do so, they themselves do not acknowledge; for the will's love inspires whatever it desires into the understanding, and not the reverse; it even destroys in the understanding everything that is not from itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 209</h4><p>209. It is remarkable that when to such heaven is opened, and they are told that they are insane, and this is also made evident to their very perception, which is done by influx and enlightenment, still they shut up heaven to themselves with indignation, and look to the earth, under which is hell. This takes place with those in the spiritual world who are not yet in hell, and who are of this character. This shows how mistaken those are who think, "When I shall have seen heaven and shall have heard angels talking with me I shall acknowledge." Their understanding acknowledges; and yet if the will does not also acknowledge they do not acknowledge; for the will's love inspires the understanding with whatever it desires, and not the reverse; it even destroys in the understanding every thing that is not from itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 209 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>209. Mirabile est, quod cum aperitur talibus coelum, et dicitur quod insaniant, et id quoque ad ipsam illorum perceptionem, quod fit per influxum ac illustrationem, manifestatur, usque tamen ex indignatione occludunt sibi coelum, et spectant in terram, sub qua est infernum: hoc fit cum illis in mundo spirituali, qui adhuc extra infernum sunt, ac tales; ex quo patet error illorum, qui cogitant, si videro coelum, et audivero angelos mecum loquentes, agnoscam; sed [si] intellectus illorum agnoscit, at si non simul voluntas, usque non agnoscunt: nam amor voluntatis inspirat intellectui quicquid vult, et non vicissim, imo delet omne quod in intellectu non a semet est. </p>
