<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第263节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>263、为使所说的这一切变得更清楚，我在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》<a href="../lord/60.htm">（60-61节）</a>末尾进行了补充说明，内容如下：根据信经教义，主里面的神和人不是两个位格，乃是一个位格，完全为一，正如灵魂和身体为一。这一点从主所说的许多话很清楚地看出来，如：父与祂为一<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">（约翰福音10:30）</a>；凡父所有的都是祂的，凡祂所有的都是父的<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">（约翰福音16:15）</a>；祂在父里面，父在祂里面<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">（约翰福音14:10）</a>；万有都交在祂手里<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">（约翰福音3:35）</a>；祂得了所有权柄（马太福音28:18）；祂是天地之神；凡信祂的，都有永生（约翰福音3:15）；凡不信的，神的震怒住在他身上；还有，神性和人性都被提入天堂，祂在这两方面坐在神的右手边，也就是说，祂是全能；此外，还有前面从圣言所引用的关于其神性人身或人性方面的大量经文。这一切清楚证明以下事实：神在位格和本质上都为一，三位一体在祂里面，这位神就是主。<p>关于主的这些事之所以首次出版，是因为启示录（21，22章）预言，在前一个教会结束的时候，一个新教会要建立起来，而该教义将是新教会的基本教义。那些章节中的“新耶路撒冷”所表示的，正是这个新教会，除了那些承认唯独主是天地之神的人以外，没有人会进入新教会；这就是为何该教会被称为“羔羊的妻”。我可以声明，整个天堂唯独承认主，凡不承认祂的，都不允许进入天堂，因为天堂由于主而为天堂。出于爱和信的这种承认本身会使人们在主里面，主也在他们里面，正如祂自己在约翰福音中所教导的：<p>到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">（约翰福音14:20）</a> <p><p>你们要住在我里面，我也住在你们里面。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子，因为离了我，你们就不能做甚么。人若不住在我里面，就被丢在外面。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">（约翰福音15:4-6</a>；<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">17:22-23）</a><p>以前这一点从圣言看不出来，即便看出来，也不会被接受，因为最后的审判尚未完成；在此之前，地狱的权势胜过天堂的权势；人在天堂与地狱的中间；所以，如果我们过早地看到这一点，魔鬼，也就是地狱，会把它从人们心里拔出来，还会亵渎它。地狱权势的这种状态被现已完成的最后审判彻底粉碎。一旦这审判完成，也就是说，现在完成，凡想被光照并变得智慧的人都能被光照并变得智慧。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 263</h4><p>263. Still, to make the observations we have just made still more clearly apparent, I will append those we presented in <a href="../lord/60.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 60-61</a>, at the end there, which are as follows: <p>That God and man in the Lord are, according to the doctrine, not two but one person, and altogether one, as the soul and body are one, is clearly apparent from many things which He Himself said. As for example: <p>That the Father and He are one. <sup>1</sup><p>That all things of the Father are His, and all His the Father's. <sup>2</sup><p>That He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. <sup>3</sup><p>That all things have been given into His hand. <sup>4</sup><p>That He has all power. <sup>5</sup><p>That He is the God of heaven and earth. <sup>6</sup><p>That whoever believes in Him has eternal life. <sup>7</sup>(And that he who does not believe in Him, the wrath of God abides on him. <sup>8</sup>) <p>And further, that both His Divinity and His humanity were taken up into heaven, and that He sits with both at the right hand of God, meaning that He is omnipotent. <sup>9</sup><p>See also the many other statements we have presented from the Word in abundance above concerning His Divine humanity - all of which attest that God is one in both person and essence, in whom is the Trinity, and that that God is the Lord.</p><p>[2] These observations about the Lord are now for the first time made public because it was foretold in the book of Revelation, chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>, that a new church would be established at the end of the former one, in which this would be the primary tenet. <p>It is this church that is there meant by the New Jerusalem, which no one can enter but one who acknowledges the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth, on which account that church is there called the Lamb's wife. <p>I can, moreover, report the following, that the whole of heaven acknowledges the Lord alone, and that anyone who does not acknowledge Him is not admitted into heaven. For heaven is heaven owing to the Lord. That very acknowledgment, made out of love and faith, causes the inhabitants to be in the Lord and the Lord in them, as He teaches in John: <p>At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 263</h4><p>263. For a clearer view of all this, I may add some material presented at the close of <a href="../lord/60.htm">Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord 60-61</a>, as follows. <p>It is quite clear from many things that the Lord said that God and Human in him are not two but are one, as the theology says, and are completely one, like soul and body. He said, for example, that the Father and he are one [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>], that whatever belongs to the Father is his and that whatever belongs to him is the Father's [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>], that he is in the Father and the Father in him [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a>], that everything has been given into his hand [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>], that he has all power [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>], that he is God of heaven and earth, that everyone who believes in him has eternal life [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15</a>], and that the wrath of God rests on everyone who does not believe in him. He says further that both the divine and the human have been raised up into heaven, and in regard to both he is sitting at the right hand of God (that is, he is omnipotent), and more passages from the Word about his divine human nature that have already been cited in abundance. All of this material bears witness to the fact that God is one in both person and essence, containing a trinity, and that this God is the Lord.</p><p>[2] The reason this information about the Lord is only now being made public is that it was foretold in chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a> of the Book of Revelation that a new church would be established at the close of the former one, a church in which this would be fundamental. This church is what "the New Jerusalem" means in those chapters, where no one will enter except those who recognize the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, which is why that church is called "the Lamb's bride." I am able to proclaim that the whole heaven believes in the Lord alone and that anyone who does not believe this is not allowed into heaven. Heaven is heaven because of the Lord. It is this belief, held in love and in faith, that puts us in the Lord and the Lord in us, as he tells us in John: "In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>); and "Abide in me, and I in you. I am the vine, you are the branches; all who abide in me, and I in them, bear abundant fruit, for without me you cannot do anything. Whoever does not abide in me is cast out" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_6.htm">6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>).</p><p>[3] The reason this has not been seen in the Word before is that if it had been seen any earlier it would not have been accepted. The last judgment had not yet been completed; and until that happened, hell was stronger than heaven. We are in the middle, between heaven and hell; so if we had seen this any earlier, the devil--hell, that is--would have snatched it from our hearts and would have profaned it as well. <p>This state of hell's power was shattered by the Last Judgment, which has now been completed. Once that was done, in other words now, anyone who wants to be enlightened and wise can be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 263</h4><p>263. In order that those things that have just been stated may appear more clearly, I will add what has been set forth towards the end of THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD (n. <a href="../lord/60.htm">60-61</a>). This is as follows:<p>"That God and Man in the Lord, according to the doctrine of the Creed, are not two but one Person, and altogether one as the soul and body are one, appears clearly from many things which He said, as: that the Father and He are one; that all thing of the Father are His, and all His are the Father's; that He is in the Father, and the Father in Him; that all things are given into His Hand; that He has all power; that He is the God of heaven and earth; that He who believes on Him has eternal life; and that the wrath of God abides upon him who does not believe on Him; and further, that both the Divine and the Human were taken up into heaven, and that as to both He sits at the right hand of God, that is, that He is Almighty; besides many passages from the Word concerning His Divine Human which were copiously quoted above. All these testify that God is one both in Person and in Essence, in whom is a Trinity, and that this God is the Lord.</p><p>[2] "These things concerning the Lord are now published for the first time because it is foretold in the Revelation, chapters XXI and XXII, that at the end of the former Church a new Church is to be established in which this will be the cardinal doctrine. It is this Church that is there meant by the New Jerusalem, into which no one can enter but he who acknowledges the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth; and therefore this Church is there called 'the Lamb's wife'. I am also enabled to declare that the universal heaven acknowledges the Lord alone, and that he who does not acknowledge Him is not admitted into heaven, for heaven is heaven from the Lord. This acknowledgment itself from love and faith causes men to be in the Lord, and the Lord in them, as He teaches in John:<p>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>;<p>and again in the same Book:<p>Abide in me, and I in you ... I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">17:22-23</a>.</p><p>[3] "This has not been understood from the Word before, because if it had been, it would not have been received. For the Last Judgment had not yet been accomplished; and prior to that event the power of hell prevailed over the power of heaven. Man is in the midst between heaven and hell; and therefore if this had been seen before, the devil, that is, hell, would have plucked it out of the hearts of men and would, moreover, have profaned it. This state of predominance on the part of hell was completely broken by the Last Judgment, which has now been accomplished. Since that Judgment, and thus today, everyone who desires it may obtain enlightenment and wisdom." </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 263</h4><p>263. But that all this that has been said may be still more clear, I will add what has been said at the end of the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (<a href="60.htm">60</a>, <a href="61.htm">61</a>), which is as follows:- <p>That God and Man in the Lord, according to the doctrine [of the creed], are not two, but one person, and wholly one as the soul and the body are one, is clearly evident from many things that He said, as, That the Father and He are one; That all things of the Father are His, and all His are the Father's; That He is in the Father, and the Father in Him; That all things have been given into His hand; That He has all power: That he is the God of heaven and earth; That whosoever believes in Him has eternal life; and that whosoever does not believe in Him, upon him the wrath of God abides; and further, that both the Divine and the Human were taken up into heaven, and that in respect to both He sits at the right hand of God, that is, that He is almighty; and many more things that have been cited above in great abundance from the Word respecting His Divine Human; all of which testify that God is one both in person and in essence, in whom is a trinity, and that the Lord is that God.</p><p>[2] These things respecting the Lord are now for the first time published because it has been foretold in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Apocalypse 21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>) that a new church would be instituted at the end of the former church in which this doctrine would be primary. It is this church that is there meant by the New Jerusalem, into which none can enter except those that acknowledge the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth; and this is why that church is there called the Lamb's wife. And I am able to announce that the entire heaven acknowledges the Lord alone, and that whoever does not acknowledge Him is not admitted into heaven, for heaven is heaven from the Lord. This acknowledgment itself, from love and faith, causes men to be in the Lord and the Lord in them, as He Himself teaches in John:- <p>In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>): <p>again, in the same:- <p>Abide in Me and I in you. I am the Vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit, for apart from Me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in Me he is cast forth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">17:22-23</a>).</p><p>[3] This has not been seen from the Word before, because even if it had been it would not have been accepted, for the last judgment had not yet been accomplished; and before that the power of hell prevailed over the power of heaven; and man is midway between heaven and hell. If, then, this had been seen before, the devil, that is, hell, would have plucked it out of the hearts of men and would also have profaned it. This state of the power of hell was wholly broken up by the last judgment, which has now been accomplished. Since that judgment, that is, now, every man who wishes to be enlightened and to be wise can be. </p>
