<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第240节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>240、引用236到239节所列举的这一切例子，是为了说明，发生在世上，无论恶人还是善人身上的每一件事，哪怕最小的事，都属于圣治；因此，圣治就在人的思维和行为的最小细节里面，因而是普遍的。但由于这一点无法从这些例子看出来，除非逐一解释它们，所以从236节开始，我将按列举它们的顺序简要解释它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 240</h4><p>240. We have cited all the considerations enumerated in nos. <a href="236.htm">236-239</a> in order that it may be seen that each and every occurrence in the world, among both evil people and good, is governed by Divine providence; consequently that Divine providence operates in the least particulars of a person's thoughts and actions; and that it is therefore universal. <p>But inasmuch as this cannot be seen from those considerations unless they are each explained one by one, therefore we will briefly explain them in the order in which they were cited, beginning at no. <a href="236.htm">236</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 240</h4><p>240. All the examples listed in 237, 238, and 239 [<a href="236.htm">236</a>, <a href="237.htm">237</a>, <a href="238.htm">238</a>, and <a href="239.htm">239</a>] have been cited to show that every least thing that happens in the world, whether to evil people or to good people, is under divine providence, and particularly that divine providence is active in the smallest details of our own thoughts and actions and is therefore universal. <p>However, since these examples will not make it clear without a presentation of the details of each one individually, I need to expand briefly on the items cited in the order of their listing, beginning at <a href="236.htm">236</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 240</h4><p>240. All the things enumerated in numbers <a href="236.htm">236-239</a>, have been presented to the end that it may be seen that all things in general and in particular that take place in the world, both with the wicked and with the good, are of the Divine Providence; consequently that the Divine Providence is in the most individual things of man's thoughts and actions, and therefore that it is universal. But as this cannot be seen from the things presented unless each is explained separately, therefore a brief explanation of them will be given in the order in which they were presented, beginning with n. <a href="236.htm">236</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 240</h4><p>240. All the things that have been mentioned in sections <a href="236.htm">236</a>, <a href="237.htm">237</a>, <a href="238.htm">238</a>, and <a href="239.htm">239</a>, have been presented to the end that it may be seen that each and all things that take place in the world, both with the evil and with the good, belong to the Divine providence; consequently that the Divine providence is in the smallest particulars of man's thoughts and actions, and therefore is universal. But as this cannot be seen from the things presented unless each one is explained by itself they shall be briefly explained in the order in which they were presented, beginning with section 236. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 240 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>240. Omnia illa quae in Numeris [236,] 237-239 recensita sunt, adducta sunt ob finem, ut videatur, quod omnia et singula quae in Mundo fiunt, tam apud malos quam apud bonos, sint Divinae Providentiae; proinde quod Divina Providentia sit in singularissimis cogitationum et actionum hominis, et quod inde sit universalis. Sed quia hoc ex illis non videri potest, nisi singula seorsim explicentur, ideo eo ordine, quo adducta sunt, breviter explicanda sunt, incipiendo a <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_240/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_236">236</a>. </p>
