<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>122、然而，要充分认识到，当一个人愿意悔改时，他必须唯独转向主。他若只转向父神，就无法被洁净；为了子而转向父或转向仅作为一个人的子，也无法被洁净。因为神只有一位，这位神就是主，祂的神性和人性是一个位格，如《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》所说明的。为使人在即将悔改时能唯独转向主，主设立了圣餐，向那些悔改的人确保罪得赦免。之所以提供这种确保，是因为在领受圣餐或圣体中，每个人都唯独专注于主。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 122</h4><p>122. It should be rightly known, however, that a person ready to repent ought to look to the Lord alone. If he looks only to God the Father, he cannot be purified. Nor if he looks to the Father for the sake of the Son. Nor if he looks to the Son as simply a man. For there is one God, and that God is the Lord, inasmuch as His Divinity and Humanity constitute one person, as we have shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord. <p>In order that everyone ready to repent might look to the Lord alone, the Lord instituted the Holy Supper, which confirms the remission of sins in people who repent. It confirms this, because in that Supper or Communion everyone is kept looking to the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 122</h4><p>122. We need to be fully aware, however, that when we are about to repent we need to turn to the Lord alone. If we turn only to God the Father we cannot be cleansed, nor if we turn to the Father for the sake of the Son or to the Son as merely human. There is only one God, and the Lord is that God because his divine and his human natures are one person, as I have explained in Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord. To enable us to turn to the Lord alone when we are about to repent, the Lord instituted the Holy Supper, assuring forgiveness of sins to those who repent. The sacrament offers that assurance because during that Supper or Communion, each participant is kept focused on the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 122</h4><p>122. But it should be fully understood that a man in doing the work of repentance ought to look to the Lord alone. If he looks to God the Father only, he cannot be purified; nor if he looks to the Father for the sake of the Son; nor if he looks to the Son as only a man. For there is one God, and the Lord is He, His Divine and His Human being one Person, as was shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD. In order that everyone in the work of repentance might look to the Lord alone He instituted the Holy Supper, which confirms the remission of sins with those who repent. It does so because in that Supper or Communion the attention of everyone is directed to the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 122</h4><p>122. But it must be well understood that when a man wishes to repent he must look to the Lord alone; if he looks to God the Father only he cannot be cleansed; nor if he looks to the Father for the sake of the Son, nor if he looks to the Son as merely a man. For there is one God, and that one is the Lord, His Divine and Human being one person, as shown in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. In order that man in repenting might look to the Lord alone He instituted the Holy Supper, which confirms the remission of sins in those who repent. It confirms this because in that Supper or communion every one is kept looking to the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 122 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>122. At probe sciendum est, quod homo poenitentiam acturus ad solum Dominum spectare debeat; si ad solum Deum Patrem, non potest purificari; nec si ad Patrem propter Filium; nec si ad Filium ut solum Hominem; est enim unus Deus, et Dominus est Ille, nam Divinum et Humanum Ipsius est una Persona, ut in DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE DOMINO, ostensum est. Ut quisque poenitentiam acturus spectet ad Dominum solum, instituta est Sancta Coena ab Ipso, quae confirmat remissionem peccatorum apud illos qui poenitentiam agunt; confirmat, quia in illa Coena seu Communione quisque tenetur spectare ad solum Dominum. </p>
