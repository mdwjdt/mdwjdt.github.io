<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第204节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>204、⑸天堂和地狱就处于这样一个形式。我在《天堂与地狱》（1758年于伦敦出版）一书<a href="../hh/59.htm">（59-102节）</a>，以及《圣爱与圣智》和本书几个地方已经提到，天堂处于人的形式；因此，我不再进一步举证。我说过，地狱也处于人的形式；但这个形式是畸形的，就是魔鬼所拥有的那种形式，魔鬼意味着作为一个整体的地狱。地狱之所以拥有一个人的形式，是因为那里的人也曾生而为人，拥有被称为自由和理性的两种人类官能；只是他们滥用自己的自由来意愿并实行邪恶，滥用自己的理性来思考并确认邪恶。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 204</h4><p>204. (5) Heaven and hell exist in such a form. That heaven is in the human form is something we made known in the book Heaven and Hell, published in London, 1758, (<a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-102</a>), and also in our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, and several times again in the present treatise. Consequently we refrain from confirming it further. <p>We say that hell, too, is in the human form, but it is in a monstrous human form, like that of the devil, by which is meant hell in its entirety. It is in the human form because the people who are in hell were also born human beings, and they also have the two human faculties called freedom and rationality - even though they abuse their freedom so as to will and do evil, and their rationality so as to think and justify it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 204</h4><p>204. 5. Heaven and hell are in this kind of form. I have noted in <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-102</a> (published in London in 1758) that heaven is in the human form and have mentioned the same in Divine Love and Wisdom and occasionally in the present work, so I refrain from presenting further support. <p>I have said that hell is also in a human form, but it is in a grotesque human form, the kind of form the devil has, the devil meaning hell taken as a whole. Hell has a human form because the people there were born human and have those two human capacities called freedom and rationality even though they have misused their freedom for intending and doing evil and their rationality for thinking and justifying it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 204</h4><p>204. V. HEAVEN AND HELL ARE IN SUCH A FORM. It was made known that heaven is in the human form in the work HEAVEN AND HELL, published in London in 1758 (n. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-102</a>) also in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM; and also in several parts of this treatise. I therefore refrain from giving further proof. It is stated that hell also is in the human form; but it is in a monstrous human form, like that of the devil by whom is meant hell in the whole complex. Hell is in the human form because those who are there were also born men, and they also have the two human faculties called liberty and rationality, although they have abused their liberty in willing and doing evil, and their rationality in thinking and confirming it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 204</h4><p>204. (5) Heaven and hell are in such a form. That heaven is in the human form has been made known in the work on Heaven and Hell, published in London in 1758 (<a href="59.htm">59-102</a>); also the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom; also in several places in the present treatise. Further evidence will therefore be omitted. Hell also is said to be in the human form; but it is in a monstrous human form, like that of the devil, by whom is meant hell in the whole complex. Hell is in the human form, because those who are there were also born men, and have the two human faculties called liberty and rationality; although they have abused their liberty in willing and doing evil, and their rationality in thinking and confirming evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 204 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>204. V. Quod Coelum et Infernum in tali forma sit. Quod Coelum in forma humana sit, in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_204/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59">de COELO ET INFERNO 59-102</a> Londini 1758 edito notum factum est; et quoque in Transactione de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA; et quoque in hac Transactione aliquoties; quare illa ulterius confirmare supersedeo. Dicitur quod Infernum etiam in forma humana <sup>1</sup>sit, sed est in forma humana monstrosa, in quali est Diabolus, per quem intelligitur infernum in toto complexu: in forma humana est, quia etiam illi qui ibi sunt, nati sunt homines, et illis quoque sunt binae illae facultates humanae, quae vocantur Libertas et Rationalitas, tametsi Libertate abusi sunt ad volendum et faciendum malum, et Rationalitate ad cogitandum et confirmandum illud.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: hnmana </p>
