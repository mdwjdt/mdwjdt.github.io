<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第58节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>58、圣治在拯救人类上尤其关注来自它自身的无限和永恒之物，因为圣治以一个来自人类的天堂为目的，如前所示<a href="27.htm">（27-45节）</a>。由于这就是目的，所以可知，人的改造和重生，因而他的救赎就是圣治所特别关注的，因为天堂是由那些已经得救或重生的人组成的。由于使人重生就是将他里面的良善和真理，或爱和智慧结合在一起，就像它们在从主发出的神性中结合在一起那样，所以圣治在拯救人类上尤其关注这一点；无限和永恒的形像在人里面只存在于良善和真理的婚姻中。神性发出在人类身上实现这种婚姻，这一点从以下事实可知：有些人因充满被称为圣灵的神性发出而发预言，圣言提到了他们；还有一些人因被光照而在天堂之光中看见神性真理。天使尤其是这种情况，他们明显感知到同在、流注和结合；但这些天使也认识到，这种结合的真正性质可称为一种附加，或一种直接接触。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 58</h4><p>58. The reason Divine providence regards something infinite and eternal from itself especially in saving humankind is that Divine providence has as its end a heaven from the human race, as we showed above in nos. <a href="27.htm">27-45</a>. And because that is its object, it follows that a person's reformation and regeneration, thus his salvation, is what Divine providence especially regards, for heaven consists of people who have been saved or regenerated. <p>Since to regenerate a person is to unite goodness and truth or love and wisdom in him, as they are united in the Divinity emanating from the Lord, therefore Divine providence regards this especially in saving humankind. An image of the infinite and eternal is present in a person only in a marriage of goodness and truth. <p>That the emanating Divine brings about this marriage in humankind is known from those who have been filled with the emanating Divine, called the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, as reported in the Word; <sup>1</sup>and from those who have been enlightened to see Divine truths in the light of heaven - especially in the case of angels, who sensibly perceive the presence, influx, and conjunction. Yet these also recognize that the conjunction really is only what may be called an adjunction. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_11_25.htm">Numbers 11:25-27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_10_5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_10_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_19_20.htm">19:20-24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_5.htm">Ezekiel 11:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_67.htm">Luke 1:67</a>.

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 58</h4><p>58. The reason divine providence focuses on what is infinite and eternal particularly in its intent to save the human race is that the goal of divine providence is a heaven from the human race (see <a href="37.htm">37-45</a> above). Since this is the goal, it follows that the main focus of divine providence is reforming and regenerating us, that is, saving us, since heaven is made up of people who have been reformed and regenerated. <p>Since regenerating us is a matter of uniting what is good and what is true, or love and wisdom, within us the way they are united in divinity that emanates from the Lord, divine providence focuses primarily on this in its intent to save the human race. The image of the Infinite and Eternal One can be found in us only in the marriage of what is good and what is true. We know that emanating divinity accomplishes this for the human race because of individuals described in the Word, individuals who have prophesied after being filled with that emanating divinity called the Holy Spirit, as well as because of enlightened people who see divine truths in the light of heaven. We see this particularly in angels, who have a sensory awareness of the presence, inflow, and union. Angels are also aware, though, that the true nature of this union could be called a direct contact. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 58</h4><p>58. The Divine Providence regards what is infinite and eternal from itself especially in saving the human race, because the Divine Providence has for its end a heaven from the human race, as was shown above (n. <a href="27.htm">27-45</a>); and because this is the end it follows that the reformation and the regeneration of man, thus his salvation, is what the Divine Providence especially regards; for heaven exists from those who have been saved or regenerated.<p>Since to regenerate man is to unite good and truth in him, or love and wisdom, as they are united in the Divine which proceeds from the Lord, therefore the Divine Providence especially regards this in saving the human race; and the image of the Infinite and Eternal exists in man Only in the marriage of good and truth. That the Divine Proceeding effects this marriage in the human race is well known from those who, being filled with the Divine Proceeding, which is called the Holy Spirit, have prophesied, of whom mention is made in the Word; and from those who, being enlightened, see Divine truths in the light of heaven. This is especially the case in angels, who sensibly perceive presence, influx and conjunction; but these angels also recognise that the conjunction is only what may be called adjunction. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 58</h4><p>58. The Divine providence looks to what is infinite and eternal from itself especially in saving the human race, because the Divine providence has as its end a heaven from the human race (as has been shown above, <a href="27.htm">27-45</a>); and because this is its end it follows that the reformation and the regeneration of man, thus his salvation, is what the Divine providence especially looks to, for from those that have been saved or regenerated heaven exists. Since to regenerate man is to unite good and truth in him, or love and wisdom, as they are united in the Divine that goes forth from the Lord, it is to this that the Divine providence especially looks in saving the human race. The image of the Infinite and Eternal is in man exclusively in the marriage of good and truth. That this is accomplished in mankind by the Divine that goes forth is known from the fact that there have been those who when filled with the Divine that goes forth, which is called the Holy Spirit, have prophesied, of whom in the Word; and there are those who, when enlightened, behold Divine truths in the light of heaven; this can be especially seen in angels, who sensibly perceive the presence, the influx, and the conjunction; but angels also recognize that this conjunction is nothing more than what may be called an adjunction. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 58 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>58. Quod Divina Providentia spectet infinitum ac aeternum a se imprimis in salvando Genere humano, est quia finis Divinae Providentiae est Coelum ex genere humano, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_58/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_27">27</a> <sup>1</sup>ad <sup>2</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_58/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_45">45</a>, ostensum est; et quia illud est finis, sequitur, quod reformatio et regeneratio hominis, ita salvatio ejus sit, quam Divina Providentia imprimis spectat, nam ex salvatis seu regeneratis existit coelum. Quoniam regenerare hominem est unire bonum et verum apud illum, seu amorem et sapientiam, sicut unita sunt in Divino quod procedit a Domino, ideo Divina Providentia hoc in salvando Genere humano imprimis spectat; imago infiniti ac aeterni non alibi apud hominem est, quam in conjugio boni et veri. Quod Divinum procedens hoc faciat in humano genere, notum est ex illis, qui impleti Divino procedente, quod Spiritus Sanctus vocatur, prophetarunt, de quibus in Verbo: et ex illis qui illustrati Divina vera in luce coeli vident; imprimis in angelis, qui sensu percipiunt praesentiam, influxum et conjunctionem; sed hi animadvertunt etiam, quod conjunctio non alia sit, quam quae vocari potest adjunctio.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: 37<p>2 Prima editio: ae </p>
