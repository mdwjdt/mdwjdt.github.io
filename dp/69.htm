<h4 align="center"></h4><p>69、另一方面，不允许自己被引入并分配到天堂的人，会在地狱预备自己的地方。因为人凭自己不断倾向地狱的最深处，但不断被主拉回来。无法拉回来的人，就在那里预备一个地方；一离开这个世界，他就被分配到那地方。地狱里的这个地方与天堂里的某个地方是对立的，因为地狱与天堂直接对立。因此，正如天使-人照着他对良善和真理的情感而在天堂分到自己的地方，魔鬼-人照着他对邪恶和虚假的情感而在地狱分到自己的地方。因为这两个对立面彼此相对，按着相似的排列而保持联系。这就是圣治对地狱的核心目标。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 69</h4><p>69. On the other hand, a person who does not allow himself to be led to heaven and assigned to a place there is prepared for his place in hell. For of himself a person continually inclines to the lowest part of hell, but is continually led away from it by the Lord. And one who cannot be led away is prepared for some place or other there, to which he is also assigned immediately after his departure from the world. Moreover, that place there is opposite some place in heaven, for hell is directly opposite to heaven. Consequently, as an angelic person is allotted a place in heaven in accordance with his affection for goodness and truth, so a diabolical person is allotted a place in hell in accordance with his affection for evil and falsity. For two opposites arranged in a like position across from each other are kept in connection. <p>This is the inmost object of Divine providence as regards hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 69</h4><p>69. In contrast, people who do not allow themselves to be led to heaven and enrolled there are prepared for their places in hell. Left to ourselves, we constantly gravitate toward the very depths of hell, while the Lord is constantly drawing us back. If we do not let ourselves be drawn back, we are prepared for particular places in hell, where we are enrolled immediately after our departure from this world. Each such place is opposite to a particular place in heaven because hell is directly opposed to heaven. So just as angel-people are assigned their places in heaven according to their desires for what is good and true, devil-people are assigned their places in hell according to their desires for what is evil and false. Two opposing entities set against each other in parallel arrangement are kept in connection. <p>This is the very heart of divine providence in respect to hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 69</h4><p>69. The man, however, who does not suffer himself to be led to heaven and assigned there is prepared for his own place in hell. For man of himself continually tends to the lowest of the hells, but he is continually withheld by the Lord; and he who cannot be withheld is prepared for a certain place there, to which he also is assigned immediately after his departure from the world. This place is exactly opposite to one in heaven, for hell is the opposite of heaven. Therefore as the man who is now an angel has his place allotted to him in heaven according to his affection of good and truth, so the man who is a devil has his place allotted to him in hell according to his affection of evil and falsity. For two opposites, similarly arranged, are maintained in connected series over against one another. This is the inmost design of the Divine Providence in regard to hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 69</h4><p>69. On the other hand, the man who does not permit himself to be led and assigned to heaven is prepared for his own place in hell. For of himself man tends continually to the lowest part of hell, but he is continually withdrawn by the Lord; and he who cannot be withdrawn is prepared for a certain place there, to which also he is assigned immediately after he leaves this world; and this place there is opposite to a certain place in heaven; for hell is the opposite of heaven. Therefore as the angel-man, according to his affection for good and truth, is allotted his own place in heaven, so the devil-man, according to his affection for evil and falsity, is allotted his own place in hell. For these two opposites, arranged in like position over against each other, are held in connection. This is the inmost of the Divine providence respecting hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 69 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>69. Homo autem qui se ad coelum non duci et inscribi patitur, praeparatur ad locum suum in inferno: homo enim a se continue tendit ad infimum inferni, sed a Domino continue abducitur: et qui non abduci potest, praeparatur ad quendam locum ibi, cui etiam inscribitur statim post excessum suum e mundo; et hic locus ibi est oppositus cuidam loco in Coelo, nam Infernum in opposito est contra coelum; quare sicut homo angelus secundum affectionem boni et veri suum sortitur locum in coelo, ita homo diabolus secundum affectionem mali et falsi suum sortitur locum in inferno: duo enim opposita ordinata in simili situ contra invicem continentur in nexu. Hoc est intimum Divinae Providentiae de Inferno. </p>
