<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第253节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>253、至此，我解释了237节所列举的例子，纯属世人或严格的唯物主义者利用这些例子来确认反对圣治。现在我需要解释238节所列举的关于许多民族的宗教信仰状态的例子，纯属世人或严格的唯物主义者还拿这些例子当作反对圣治的论据。这些人心里说，如果圣治以一个来自人类的天堂为目的，如前所示<a href="27.htm">（27-45节）</a>，怎会有如此多不和谐的宗教，而不是有一个全球性的真正宗教呢？但请听我说。凡生而为人者，无论有多少，属于哪种宗教，只要承认神，并照十诫生活，也就是不杀人、奸淫、偷盗、作假见证，因为做这些事违背自己的宗教信仰，因而违背神，都能得救。这种人敬畏神并爱邻舍；他们因想到做这些事违背神而敬畏神；因想到杀人、奸淫、偷盗、作假见证，以及贪恋邻舍的房屋或妻子就是反对邻舍而爱邻舍。由于这些人在生活上仰望神，不向邻舍行恶，所以他们被主引领；那些被如此引领的人也照着他们的宗教信仰而接受关于神和邻舍的教导；因为那些如此生活的人喜欢被教导，而那些不如此生活的人则不喜欢。此外，那些喜欢被教导的人死后当成为灵人时，就会被天使教导，欣然接受圣言中的真理。关于这个主题，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》<a href="../ss/91.htm">（91-97</a>，<a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113节）</a>。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 253</h4><p>253. We have explained so far the considerations cited above in no. <a href="237.htm">237</a> by which the merely natural person confirms himself against Divine providence. We must now explain those which follow in no. <a href="238.htm">238</a>, having to do with the religious beliefs of many nations, which may also serve the merely natural person as arguments against Divine providence. For he says in his heart, "How can so many conflicting religions exist, and not one true religion throughout the whole world, when Divine providence has as its end a heaven from the human race?" - as shown above in nos. <a href="27.htm">27-45</a>. <p>But please listen. All people can be saved, however many are born and in whatever religion, provided they acknowledge God and live according to the commandments found in the Decalogue, namely not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, and not to bear false witness, because to do these things is against religion, thus against God. <p>Such people have in them a fear of God and a love of the neighbor - a fear of God because they think that to do these things is against God, and a love of the neighbor because to murder, commit adultery, steal, bear false witness, and covet the neighbor's house or wife is against the neighbor. Because they look to God in their life and do not do evil to the neighbor, they are led by the Lord, and those who are so led are also taught in accordance with their religion about God and the neighbor. For those who live thus love to be taught, whereas those who live otherwise do not. And because they love to be taught, they are also instructed by angels after death, when they become spirits, and they willingly accept such truths as are found in the Word. <p>Some observations relating to these matters may be seen in <a href="../ss/91.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture 91-97</a> and <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 253</h4><p>253. Up to this point I have been explaining the instances listed in 237 that strict materialists use to justify their opposition to divine providence. Now I need to explain the ones about the religions of many nations that follow in <a href="238.htm">238</a>, which also serve strict materialists as arguments against divine providence. These people say at heart, "How can there be so many contradictory religions rather than one worldwide, true religion when the goal of divine providence is a heaven from the human race [as explained in <a href="27.htm">27-45</a> above]?" <p>Please listen, though! No matter what religion people are born into, people can all be saved if they believe in God and live by the precepts of the Ten Commandments--not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, and not to commit perjury, because to do so would be contrary to their religion and therefore contrary to God. They have a fear of God and a love for their neighbor, a fear of God because they think that committing these acts is against God and a love for their neighbor because murder, adultery, theft, perjury, and coveting their neighbor's house and spouse are against their neighbor. Because these people turn to the Lord during their lives and do no harm to their neighbors, they are led by the Lord; and people who are so led are also taught about God and their neighbor according to their religions. This is because people who live this way want to be taught, while people who live otherwise do not. Further, people who want to be taught are taught by angels after death, when they become spirits, and gladly accept the kind of truths we find in the Word. On this subject see the material in <a href="../ss/91.htm">Teachings for the New Jerusalem on Sacred Scripture 91-97</a>, <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 253</h4><p>253. Thus far have been explained the grounds set forth above (n. <a href="237.htm">237</a>), on which the merely natural man confirms himself against the Divine Providence. The propositions which follow (n. <a href="238.htm">238</a>) will now be explained, relating to the forms of religion in many nations which may also serve the merely natural man as arguments against the Divine Providence. For he says in his heart, How is it that there can exist so many discordant religions, instead of one true religion throughout the whole world when, as was shown above (n. <a href="27.htm">27-45</a>) the Divine Providence has for its end a heaven from the human race? But I pray you, listen. All human beings that are born, however many and of whatever religion, can be saved, provided only that they acknowledge God and live according to the commandments in the Decalogue, which forbid committing murder, adultery, and theft, and bearing false witness, because to do such things is contrary to religion and thus contrary to God. With such persons there is the fear of God and the love of the neighbour: the fear of God because they think that to do these things is to act against God; and the love of the neighbour, because to murder, to commit adultery, to steal, to bear false witness and to covet the neighbour's house and his wife is to act against the neighbour. Because these persons have regard to God in their life and do no evil to the neighbour, they are led by the Lord; and those who are so led are also taught in accordance with their religion concerning God and the neighbour; for those who so live love to be taught, but those who live otherwise have no such desire. As they love to be taught, after death when they become spirits they are also instructed by angels and willingly receive such truths as are in the Word. Something about them may be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE (n. <a href="../ss/91.htm">91-97</a> and n. <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 253</h4><p>253. Thus far have been explained the things presented above (in<a href="237.htm">237</a>), by which the merely natural man confirms himself against Divine providence. The things that follow (in<a href="238.htm">238</a>), relating to the state of religion in various nations, that also may serve the merely natural man as arguments against Divine providence, shall now be explained. For the natural man says in his heart, How can so many discordant religions exist, instead of one true religion over all the earth, if the Divine providence has as its end a heaven from the human race (as shown above,<a href="27.htm">27-45</a>)? But listen, I pray: All the human beings that are born, however many and in whatever religion, can be saved, provided they acknowledge God and live according to the commandments in the Decalogue, which are not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, and not to bear false witness, for the reason that doing such things is contrary to religion, and thus contrary to God. Such fear God and love the neighbor; they fear God in the thought that to do such things is contrary to God; and they love the neighbor in the thought that to kill, to commit adultery, to steal, to bear false witness, and to covet the neighbor's house or wife is against the neighbor. Because such in their life look to God, and do not do evil to the neighbor, they are led by the Lord; and those who are led are also taught in accordance with their religion, about God and about the neighbor; for those who so live love to be taught, while those who live otherwise do not; and because they love to be taught, when after death they become spirits they are instructed by the angels and gladly accept such truths as are in the Word. Something about these may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (<a href="91.htm">91-97</a>, and<a href="104.htm">104-113</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 253 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>253. Hactenus explicata sunt illa quae supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_253/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_237">237</a> allata sunt, per quae mere naturalis homo contra Divinam Providentiam se confirmat; nunc explicanda sunt illa quae <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_253/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_238">238</a> sequuntur, quae concernunt religiosa plurium gentium, quae etiam homini mere naturali inservire possunt pro argumentis contra Divinam Providentiam; corde enim dicit, quomodo possunt tot religiones dissidentes dari, et non una vera super totum terrarum Orbem, cum Divina Providentia pro fine habet Coelum ex Humano Genere, ut supra [n.] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_253/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_27">27-45</a>, ostensum est.
