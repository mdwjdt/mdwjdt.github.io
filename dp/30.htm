<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第30节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>30、主在自然界的天堂被称为教会；这个天堂的一位天使就是一个与主结合的教会之人；他离开这个世界后，也就成为属灵天堂的一位天使。由此清楚看出，论到天使天堂的话同样适用于被称为教会的人类天堂。与主的相互结合构成人里面的天堂，主在约翰福音中以这些话揭示了这一点：<p>你们要住在我里面，我也住在你们里面。住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">（约翰福音15:4-5</a>，<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">7）</a></p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 30</h4><p>30. The Lord's heaven in the natural world is called the church, and an angel of that heaven is a person of the church who has been conjoined with the Lord. After his departure from the world such a person also becomes an angel of the spiritual heaven. It is apparent from this that what we have said of the angelic heaven must be understood to apply also to the human heaven which is called the church. <p>This reciprocal conjunction with the Lord which constitutes heaven in a person was revealed by the Lord in these words in John: <p>Abide in Me, and I in you?. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 30</h4><p>30. The Lord's heaven in our physical world is called the church, and an angel of this heaven is a church member who is united to the Lord. After leaving this world, people like this become angels of the spiritual heaven; so we can see that the sort of thing I have been saying about the angelic heaven applies also to the human heaven called the church. <p>The mutual union with the Lord that constitutes heaven for us was revealed by the Lord in this passage from John: <p>Abide in me, and I in you. People who abide in me, and I in them, bear an abundance of fruit; for without me you cannot do anything. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 30</h4><p>30. The Lord's heaven in the natural world is called the Church; and an angel of this heaven is a man of the Church who is conjoined to the Lord; and after he leaves this world he becomes an angel of the spiritual heaven. From this it is clear that what has been said of the angelic heaven must also be understood of the human heaven that is called the Church. This reciprocal conjunction with the Lord, which constitutes heaven in man, is revealed by the Lord in these words in John:<p>Abide in me, and I in you. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 30</h4><p>30. The Lord's heaven in the natural world is called the church; and an angel of that heaven is a man of the church who is conjoined with the Lord, and who becomes an angel of the spiritual heaven after he leaves this world. From this it is clear that what has been said of the angelic heaven applies equally to the human heaven that is called the church. That reciprocal conjunction with the Lord which makes heaven in man is revealed by the Lord in these words:- <p>Abide in Me and I in you. He that abideth in Me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for apart from Me ye can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 30 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>30. Coelum Domini in Mundo naturali vocatur Ecclesia, et angelus hujus Coeli est homo Ecclesiae qui Domino conjunctus est; hic etiam post excessum e Mundo fit angelus Coeli spiritualis: ex quo patet, quod simile, quod dictum est de Coelo angelico, intelligendum sit de Coelo humano, quod vocatur Ecclesia. Conjunctio illa reciproca cum Domino, quae facit Coelum apud hominem, revelata est a Domino his verbis apud Johannem, "Manete in Me, etiam Ego in vobis; qui manet in Me, et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum; quia sine Me non potestis facere quicquam," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_4-5">Johannem 15:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_7">7</a>. </p>
