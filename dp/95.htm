<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第95节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>95、由于主与人并人与主的结合都存在，所以法版有两块，一块为主，一块为人。人在何等程度上貌似凭自己遵守他石版上的律法，主就在何等程度上使他能遵守主的石版上的律法。然而，人若不遵守他石版上的律法（这些律法都涉及爱邻），就无法遵守主的石版上的律法（这些律法都涉及爱主）。一个杀人犯、盗贼、通奸者或作假见证者怎么可能爱主呢？理性岂不告诉我们，这个样子和爱主是自相矛盾吗？这不是魔鬼的样子吗？魔鬼除了恨主，还能干别的吗？但当一个人远离杀人、通奸、盗窃和假见证如地狱时，他就能爱主。因为这时他把脸从魔鬼转向主；当他把脸转向主时，主就把爱和智慧赐给他。爱和智慧通过脸，而不是通过项背进入人。由于与主的结合只通过这种方式实现，所以这两块石版被称为约；约是在双方之间立的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 95</h4><p>95. Since a conjunction of the Lord with a person is possible, and of a person with the Lord, therefore there are two tables of the Law, one for the Lord, and the other for man. To the extent that a person obeys as though of himself the laws of his table, to the same extent the Lord enables him to obey the laws of His, the Lord's, table. But a person who does not obey the laws of his table, all of which have to do with love for the neighbor, is incapable of obeying the laws of the Lord's table, all of which have to do with love for the Lord. How can a murderer, thief, adulterer, or false witness love the Lord? Does not reason declare that to be of such a character and to love the Lord are mutually contradictory? Is not the devil of such a character? What else can he do but hate God? <p>But when a person rejects acts of murder, adultery, theft, and false witness as hellish, then he can love the Lord, for he then turns his face away from the devil to the Lord, and when he turns his face to the Lord, he is granted love and wisdom. These enter a person through the face, and not through the back of his head. <p>Because conjunction with the Lord is formed in this way and no other, therefore the two tables of the Law are called a covenant; and a covenant is made between two parties. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 95</h4><p>95. Since there is a union of the Lord with us and of us with the Lord, there are two tablets of the law--one for the Lord and the second for us. To the extent that we keep the laws of our tablet, apparently on our own, the Lord enables us to keep the laws of his tablet. However, if we do not keep the laws of our tablet, all of which have to do with loving our neighbor, we cannot keep the laws of the Lord's tablet, all of which have to do with loving the Lord. How can a murderer, a thief, an adulterer, or a perjurer love the Lord? Surely reason tells us that being like this and loving the Lord is a contradiction. Is this not what the devil is like? Can people like this harbor anything but hatred for God? <p>When we do turn back from murder, adultery, theft, and perjury as hellish, though, then we can [harbor other feelings than hatred for God]. That is, we then turn our faces away from the devil and toward the Lord; and when we turn our faces toward the Lord, he gives us love and wisdom. These come into us through our faces, not through the backs of our necks. Because this is the only way union with the Lord is brought about, the two tablets were called a covenant. There are two parties to a covenant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 95</h4><p>95. Because there is a conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord, there are two tables of the Law, one for the Lord and the other for man. So far as a man keeps the laws of his table as if from himself, the Lord enables him to keep the laws of His table. But the man who does not keep the laws of his table, which all have reference to the love of the neighbour, cannot keep the laws of the Lord's table, which all have reference to the love of the Lord. How can a murderer, a thief, an adulterer, or a false witness love the Lord? Does not reason declare that to be of such a character and to love the Lord involves a contradiction? Is not the devil such? Can the devil do other than hate God? When, however, a man abhors murder, adultery, theft and false witness as infernal, then he can love the Lord, for he then turns his face from the devil to the Lord; and when he turns his face to the Lord love and wisdom are given to him. These enter man by the face, and not by the back of the neck. Because conjunction with the Lord is effected in this and in no other way, these two tables are called a covenant: and a covenant is a bond between two. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 95</h4><p>95. Because there is a conjunction both of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord, there are two tables of the law, one for the Lord and the other for man. So far as man keeps the law of his table as if from himself, so far the Lord enables him to keep the laws of His table. But the man who does not keep the laws of his own table, all of which refer to love to the neighbor, can not keep the laws of the Lord's table, all of which refer to love to the Lord. How can a murderer, a thief, an adulterer or a false witness, love the Lord? Does not reason declare that being such and loving God involves a contradiction? Is not the devil such? Can the devil do other than hate God? But when a man turns away from murder, adultery, theft, and false witness as infernal, then he can love the Lord; for he then turns his face from the devil to the Lord; and when he turns his face to the Lord love and wisdom are given him. These enter man by the face, and not by the back of the neck. As conjunction with the Lord is effected in this way and in no other way, these two tables are called a covenant; and a covenant is between two. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 95 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>95. Quoniam conjunctio Domini cum homine est, et hominis cum Domino, ideo duae Tabulae legis sunt, una pro Domino, et altera pro homine: quantum homo sicut ex se facit leges suae Tabulae, tantum Dominus dat ut faciat leges Ipsius Tabulae: at homo, qui non facit leges suae tabulae, quae omnes se referunt ad amorem proximi, non potest facere leges tabulae Domini, quae omnes se referunt ad amorem Domini: quomodo potest homicida, fur, adulter, et falsus testator amare Dominum; annon ratio dictat, quod talis esse et amare Deum, contradictorium sit; estne diabolus talis; num ille potest aliter quam odio habere Deum. At cum homo homicidia, adulteria, furta et falsa testimonia aversatur ut infernalia, tunc potest, nam tunc avertit faciem a diabolo ad Dominum, ac cum vertit faciem ad Dominum, datur ei amor et sapientia; haec intrant hominem per faciem, et non per cervicem ejus. Quia ita et non aliter fit conjunctio cum Domino, ideo binae illae Tabulae vocatae sunt foedus, ac foedus est inter duos. </p>
