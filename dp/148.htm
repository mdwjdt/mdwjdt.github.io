<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>148、此外，人人都想要自由，想除去不自由或奴役。被教师管制的每个男孩都想作自己的主人，因而想要自由；这同样适用于被男主人管制的男仆和被女主人管制的女仆。每位少女都想离开她的父家，结婚成家，以便能在自己家里自由行动。想要工作、做生意或履行某种工作职责的每个年轻人，在学徒期间都想要自由，以便能自己作决定。凡决定为获得自己的自由而进行服务的人都在强迫自己；当他们强迫自己时，就是在出于自由照着理性行动。但这一切来自一种内在自由，从内在自由的角度来看，外在自由看上去就像一个仆人。这一点需要包括进来，以强化这个要点，即：自我强迫与理性和自由并不矛盾。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 148</h4><p>148. Besides, every person wishes to be free and to escape a lack of freedom or condition of servitude. Every boy who is under a schoolmaster wishes to be independent and thus free. So, too, every servant under his master, or maidservant under her mistress. Every unmarried girl wishes to leave her father's house and marry in order to act freely in her own house. Every adolescent youth who wants to work at some craft, or to engage in some business, or to perform some official duty, wishes, as long as he is in servitude under others, to be released in order to be his own master. All of these who serve of their own accord in order to gain their freedom compel themselves; and when they compel themselves, they act in freedom in accordance with their reason, but from an interior freedom which regards exterior freedom as a servant. <p>We have added this to confirm the fact that to compel oneself is not contrary to rationality and freedom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 148</h4><p>148. Beyond this, we all want to be free. We want to get rid of nonfreedom or servitude. As children subject to teachers, we want to be on our own and therefore free. The same holds true for every servant subject to a master and every maid subject to a mistress. Every young woman wants to leave her parents' house and marry so that she can function freely in her own household. Every young man who is intending to have a job, go into business, or hold some office wants to be set free throughout his apprenticeship so that he can make his own decisions. All the people who decide to go into service in order to gain their freedom are compelling themselves; and when they compel themselves they are acting freely and rationally. This comes from an inner freedom though, and from its point of view the outer freedom looks like servitude. <p>This needs to be included to reinforce the point that self-compulsion is not inconsistent with rationality and freedom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 148</h4><p>148. Moreover, every man wishes to be free, and to remove not freedom but slavery from himself. Every boy who is under a master wishes to be his own master, and so to be free. It is the same with every man-servant under his master and with every maid under her mistress. Every maiden wishes to leave her father's house and to marry, in order that she may act freely in a home of her own; and every youth who desires to engage in work, or take part in business, or perform the duties of any office, while he serves under others wishes to be released in order that he may be his own master. All those who serve of their own accord by reason of their liberty compel themselves; and when they compel themselves they act from freedom according to reason, but from an interior freedom, from which exterior freedom is looked upon as servitude. This has been stated in order to prove that it is not contrary to rationality and liberty to compel oneself </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 148</h4><p>148. Furthermore, every man wishes to be free, and to put away from himself non-freedom or servitude. Every boy subject to a teacher wishes to be his own master, and thus free; the same is true of every servant under his master, and every maidservant under her mistress. Every maiden wishes to leave her father's house and to marry, that she may act freely in her own house; every youth who desires employment or to be in business or to perform the duties of some office, while he is subject to others longs to be released, so as to be at his own disposal. All such who willingly serve for the sake of liberty compel themselves; and when they compel themselves they act from freedom in accordance with reason, but from an interior freedom, from which exterior freedom is looked upon as a servant. This has been presented to show that it is not contrary to rationality and liberty to compel oneself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 148 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>148. Praeterea omnis homo vult liber esse, ac non liberum seu servum a se removere; omnis puer qui sub magistro est, vult sui juris esse et sic liber; omnis famulus sub suo Domino, et ancilla sub sua Domina, similiter; omnis virgo vult exire domo patris et nubere, ut libere in suamet domo agat; omnis adolescens qui vult operari, vel negotiari, vel fungi aliquo officio, <sup>1</sup>dum in servitute sub aliis est, vult emancipari, ut sui arbitrii sit: omnes illi qui sponte serviunt propter libertatem, cogunt seipsos; et cum seipsos cogunt, ex libero secundum rationem agunt, sed ex interiori libero, a quo spectatur exterius liberum sicut servum. Hoc adductum est, ad confirmandum quod semetipsum cogere non sit contra rationalitatem et libertatem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: afficio, </p>
