<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第94节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>94、主与人的结合并人与主的相互结合是通过爱邻如己和爱主高于一切实现的。爱邻如己唯独在于对邻舍诚实、公正，不对他心怀仇恨或充满报复欲，不说他的坏话或诋毁他，不与他的妻子通奸，不向他做类似这样的任何事。谁看不出，那些做这类事的人并未爱邻如己？但那些因这类事是反对邻舍的邪恶，也是反对神的罪而不去做的人，则会诚实、公正、友善、忠信地对待邻舍。由于主就是如此行的，所以一种相互结合就产生了。当有了一种相互结合时，凡一个人向邻舍所行的，都是从主而行的；凡他从主所行的，都是良善。那时，他的邻舍不是这个可见的人，而是这个人里面的良善。爱主高于一切唯独在于不向圣言施暴，因为主在圣言中；不向教会的圣物施暴，因为主在教会的圣物中；不向任何人的灵魂施暴，因为每个人的灵魂都在主手里。那些避开邪恶如骇人之罪的人就爱主高于一切。但除了那些爱邻如己的人以外，没有人能做到这一点，因为这两种爱本质上为一。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 94</h4><p>94. A conjunction of the Lord with a person and a reciprocal one of the person with the Lord is formed by loving the neighbor as oneself and loving the Lord above all. <p>To love the neighbor as oneself consists simply in not dealing dishonestly or unjustly with him, not hating him or burning with vengeance against him, not cursing or defaming him, not committing adultery with his wife, and not doing other like things to him. Who cannot see that people who do such things do not love the neighbor as themselves? <p>On the other hand, people who do not do such things because they are evils injurious to the neighbor, and because they are at the same time sins against the Lord - these deal honestly, justly, amicably, and faithfully with the neighbor; and because the Lord does likewise, a reciprocal conjunction is formed. Moreover, when a reciprocal conjunction has been formed, then whatever a person does for the neighbor is done from the Lord, and whatever a person does from the Lord is good. To him the neighbor then is not the person but the good in the person. <p>To love the Lord above all consists simply in not doing evil to the Word, because the Lord is present in the Word; in not doing evil to the sanctities of the church, because the Lord is present in the sanctities of the church; and in not doing evil to anyone's soul, because everyone's soul is in the Lord's hand. People who refrain from evils as being egregious sins - these love the Lord above all. But only those are capable of this who love the neighbor as themselves, for the two loves go hand in hand. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 94</h4><p>94. The Lord's union with us and our mutual union with the Lord are accomplished through our loving our neighbor as ourselves and loving the Lord above all. <p>Loving our neighbor as ourselves is simply not dealing dishonestly or unfairly with people, not harboring hatred or burning with revenge against them, not speaking ill of them or slandering them, not committing adultery with their spouses, and not doing anything of that nature to them. Can anyone fail to see that people who do do things like this are not loving their neighbor as themselves? However, people who do not do such things because they are both bad for their neighbor and sins against God treat their neighbor honestly, fairly, cordially, and faithfully. Since the Lord acts in the same way, a mutual union results. <p>When there is a mutual union, then whatever we do for our neighbor we do from the Lord, and whatever we do from the Lord is good. Then our neighbor is not the visible individual but the goodness within that individual. <p>Loving the Lord above all is simply not doing violence to the Word because the Lord is in the Word, not doing violence to the holy practices of the church because the Lord is in the holy practices of the church, and not doing violence to any soul whatever, because everyone's soul is in the hand of the Lord. When we abstain from these evils as appalling sins, we are loving the Lord above all; but only people who love their neighbor as themselves can do so, because the two kinds of love are essentially one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 94</h4><p>94. Conjunction of the Lord with man and the reciprocal conjunction of man with the Lord is effected by loving the neighbour as oneself and loving the Lord above all things. To love the neighbour as oneself is to refrain from acting insincerely and unjustly towards him, not to hate him and burn with revenge against him, not to revile and defame him, not to commit adultery with his wife, and not to do other like things against him. Who cannot see that those who do such things do not love the neighbour as themselves? Those, however, who refrain from doing such things because they are evils against the neighbour and at the same time sins against the Lord deal in a sincere, just, friendly and faithful manner with the neighbour; and as the Lord does likewise, a reciprocal conjunction is effected. When there is reciprocal conjunction, whatever a man does to the neighbour he does from the Lord, and whatever a man does from the Lord is good. Then it is not the person but the good in the person that is the neighbour to him.<p>To love the Lord above all things is nothing else than to do no evil to the Word, because the Lord is in the Word, to do no evil to the holy things of the Church, because the Lord is in the holy things of the Church, and to do no evil to the soul of anyone, for the soul of everyone is in the hand of the Lord. Those who shun these evils as heinous sins love the Lord above all things. But this none can do except those who love the neighbour as themselves, for these two loves are joined together. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 94</h4><p>94. The conjunction of the Lord with man and the reciprocal conjunction of man with the Lord is effected by loving the neighbor as oneself and loving the Lord above all things. To love the neighbor as oneself consists solely in not acting insincerely or unjustly towards him, not holding him in hatred or burning with revenge against him, not reviling or defaming him, not committing adultery with his wife, and not doing other like things against him. Who cannot see that those who do such things do not love the neighbor as themselves? But those who do not do such things for the reason that they are evils against the neighbor and also sins against the Lord, act sincerely, justly, kindly, and faithfully in relation to the neighbor; and as the Lord does likewise, a reciprocal conjunction is effected. And when there is reciprocal conjunction, whatever a man does to the neighbor he does from the Lord; and whatever he does from the Lord is good. Then it is not the person but the good in the person that is the neighbor to him. To love the Lord above all things consists solely in doing no evil to the Word for the reason that the Lord is in the Word, or to the holy things of the church for the reason that the Lord is in the holy things of the church, or to the soul of any one, for the reason that every one's soul is in the Lord's hand. Those who shun these evils as monstrous sins love the Lord above all things. But this none can do except those who love the neighbor as themselves, for the two are joined together. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 94 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>94. Conjunctio Domini cum homine et reciproca hominis cum Domino fit per amare proximum sicut seipsum, et amare Dominum super omnia: amare proximum sicut seipsum non aliud est quam non insincere et injuste agere cum illo, non odio habere ac vindicta flagrare contra illum, non blasphemare et diffamare illum, non adulterari cum uxore ejus, et similia alia non facere contra illum: quis non videre potest, quod illi qui talia faciunt, non ament proximum sicut seipsum; at qui talia non faciunt quia sunt mala contra proximum, et simul peccata contra Dominum, illi sincere, juste, amice, fideliter agunt cum proximo, et quia Dominus similiter facit, fit conjunctio reciproca; et cum conjunctio reciproca est, tunc quicquid homo proximo facit, a Domino facit, et quicquid homo a Domino facit, est bonum; et tunc proximus illi non est persona, sed bonum in persona. Amare Dominum super omnia, non aliud est, quam non malum facere Verbo, quia in Verbo est Dominus, nec malum facere sanctis Ecclesiae, quia in sanctis Ecclesiae est Dominus, nec malum facere alicujus animae, quia anima cujusvis in manu Domini est; qui illa mala fugiunt sicut peccata enormia, illi amant Dominum super omnia: sed hoc non possunt alii, quam qui amant proximum sicut seipsum, conjuncta enim sunt. </p>
