<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第52节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>52、⑵无限和永恒本身必关注有限事物中来自它自身的无限（和永恒）之物。前面章节<a href="48.htm">（48-51节）</a>已经说明，无限和永恒本身是指神性本身；有限事物是指神性所创造的一切事物，尤指世人，灵人和天使；关注来自它自身的无限和永恒之物就是关注在它们里面的神性，也就是它自己，就像一个人在一面镜子中看到自己的形像一样。事实就是如此，这一点在《圣爱与圣智》一书有大量说明，那里尤其说明，受造宇宙中有人的一个形像，这就是无限和永恒的形像<a href="../dlw/317.htm">（317-318节）</a>，因而是神造物主，也就是永恒之主的一个形像。然而，要明白，神性本身在主里面，而来自它自身的神性是受造物中来自主的神性。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 52</h4><p>52. (2) The infinite and eternal in itself cannot but regard something infinite and eternal from itself in finite things. By the infinite and eternal in itself we mean the Divine itself, as we just showed in the preceding discussion. By finite things we means all things created by the Divine, and especially people, spirits, and angels. And to regard something infinite and eternal from itself is to regard something Divine, that is to say, itself, in them, as a person does an image of himself in a mirror. <p>The existence of such an image of the Divine is something we showed several times in the treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, especially where we demonstrated that the created universe has in it an image of the human being, and that the image is an image of the infinite and eternal, <a href="../dlw/317.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 317-318</a>, thus an image of God the Creator, which is to say, of the Lord from eternity. <p>One must know, however, that the Divine in itself exists in the Lord, while the Divine from itself is the Divinity present from the Lord in created things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 52</h4><p>52. 2. What is intrinsically infinite and eternal can only focus on what is infinite from itself in what is finite. By "what is intrinsically infinite and eternal," I mean Divinity itself, as explained in the previous section [<a href="48.htm">48-51</a>]. By "what is finite," I mean everything created by Divinity, especially people, spirits, and angels. By "focusing on what is infinite and eternal from itself," I mean focusing on what is divine in them--on itself, that is--the way we look at ourselves in a mirror. The truth of this has been amply demonstrated in Divine Love and Wisdom, especially where I explained that there is a human image in the created universe and that this is an image of what is infinite and eternal (<a href="../dlw/317.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 317-318</a>) and therefore an image of God the Creator or the Lord from eternity. <p>We still need to realize that intrinsic divinity is in the Lord, while derivative divinity is divinity from the Lord in his creatures. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 52</h4><p>52. II. THE INFINITE AND ETERNAL IN ITSELF CANNOT BUT REGARD WHAT IS INFINITE [AND ETERNAL] FROM ITSELF IN FINITE THINGS. By the Infinite and Eternal in itself is meant the Divine itself as has just been shown in the preceding article; by finite things are meant all things created by the Divine, especially men, spirits and angels; and to regard what is infinite and eternal from Himself is to regard the Divine, that is, Himself in these, as a man regards an image of himself in a mirror. That this is so has been shown in many places in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, especially where it is demonstrated that in the created universe there is an image of man, and that this is an image of what is infinite and eternal (n. <a href="../dlw/317.htm">317-318</a>), thus an image of God the Creator, that is, of the Lord from eternity. It should be known, however, that the Divine in itself is in the Lord, but that the Divine from itself is the Divine from the Lord in created things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 52</h4><p>52. (2) The Infinite and Eternal in itself must needs look to what is infinite and eternal from itself in things finite. By the Infinite and Eternal in itself the Divine Itself is meant, as has been shown in the preceding article; by things finite all things created by the Divine, especially men, spirits, and angels, are meant, and to look to what is infinite and eternal from Itself is to look to the Divine, that is, Itself, in these, as a man looks at his image in a mirror. That this is so has been shown in many places in the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, especially where it has been shown that in the created universe there is an image of man, and this is an image of what is infinite and eternal (<a href="../dlw/317.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 317-318</a>), thus an image of God the Creator, that is, the Lord from eternity. But let it be understood that the Divine in itself is in the Lord, while the Divine from itself is the Divine from the Lord in created things. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 52 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>52. II. Quod Infinitum ac Aeternum in se non possit aliter quam spectare infinitum et aeternum a se in finitis. Per Infinitum ac Aeternum in se intelligitur ipsum Divinum, ut in mox praecedente Articulo ostensum est; per finita intelliguntur omnia creata ab Ipso, ac imprimis homines, spiritus et angeli; et per spectare infinitum et aeternum a se, est spectare Divinum, hoc est, Se in illis, ut spectat homo imaginem sui in speculo: quod ita sit, pluribus ostensum est in Transactione de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA, praecipue ubi demonstratum est, quod in universo creato sit imago hominis, et quod sit imago infiniti ac aeterni, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_52/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_317">de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA 317-318</a>, ita imago Dei Creatoris, hoc est, Domini ab aeterno. At sciendum est, quod Divinum in se sit in Domino, sed Divinum a se sit Divinum a Domino in creatis. </p>
