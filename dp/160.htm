<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第160节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>160、我将在适当章节（285-294节）解释，就连恶人的生命也来自这个源头。在此仅通过对比来说明这一点。热和光从我们世界的太阳流入，它们既流入结好果子的树，同样也流入结坏果子的树；这两种树以同样的方式发芽生长。不是热本身，而是热所流入的形式造成这种差别。光也是这样，它照着它所流入的形式而转化为各种色彩。有些色彩美丽迷人，有些则丑陋阴郁，而光都是一样的。这同样适用于来自灵界太阳的本身为爱的属灵之热和本身为智慧的属灵之光的流注。造成这种差别的，是它们所流入的形式，而不是本身为爱的热和本身为智慧的光。它们所流入的形式就是人类心智。由此清楚可知，人唯独被主引领和教导。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 160</h4><p>160. We will demonstrate in subsequent discussions under its own heading that the life of evil people is from the same origin. Here we will simply illustrate it by an analogy. From the world's sun flow both warmth and light, and these flow equally into trees bearing harmful fruit as into trees bearing good fruit, and they similarly sprout and grow. The forms into which the warmth flows occasion their diversity, not the warmth in itself. It is the same with the light. This is variegated into colors in accordance with the forms into which it flows. Some colors are attractive and gay, while others are unattractive and dismal, and yet it is the same light. <p>The case is the same with the influx of spiritual warmth, which in itself is love, and of spiritual light, which in itself is wisdom, from the sun of the spiritual world. The forms into which these flow occasion their diversity, not the warmth which in itself is love, or the light which in itself is wisdom. The forms into which they flow are human minds. <p>It is apparent now from this that a person is led and taught by the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 160</h4><p>160. I will explain in its own section [<a href="285.htm">285-294</a>] that the life of evil people comes from the same source. For now, I need only to illustrate the point by comparison. Both warmth and light flow from the sun of our world, and they flow into trees that yield harmful fruit just the way they do into trees that yield good fruit. The two kinds of tree sprout and grow in the same way. The forms into which the warmth flows make the difference, not the warmth itself. <p>It is the same with the light. This is diversified into colors depending on the forms into which it flows. There are beautiful and cheerful colors, and ugly and depressing ones, yet the light is the same in either case. <p>The same holds true for the inflow from the spiritual world's sun of the spiritual warmth that is essentially love and the spiritual light that is essentially wisdom. The forms into which they flow make the difference, not the warmth that is love or the light that is wisdom in their own right. The forms into which they flow are our minds. <p>We can see from this, then, that we are led and taught by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 160</h4><p>160. That the life of the wicked is also from the same source will be shown in what follows in its proper article. Here it will merely be illustrated by a comparison. From the sun of the world heat and light flow in, alike into trees bearing evil fruit and into trees bearing good fruit; and they are alike quickened and grow. It is not the heat in itself, but the forms into which the heat flows that cause this diversity. It is the same with light, which is turned into various colours according to the forms into which it flows. Some colours are beautiful and gay, and some are ugly and sombre; and yet the light is the same. So it is with the influx of spiritual heat, which in itself is love, and of spiritual light, which in itself is wisdom, from the Sun of the spiritual world. It is the forms into which these flow that cause the diversity, and not that heat which is love, and that light which is wisdom, in themselves. The forms into which they flow are human minds. From these considerations it is now clear that man is led and taught by the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 160</h4><p>160. That the life of the evil is from the same source will be shown in its proper place further on. Here it will merely be illustrated by a comparison. From the sun of the world heat and light flow in, flowing alike into trees that bear evil fruit and into trees that bear good fruit, and they are alike quickened and grow. It is not the heat in itself, but the forms into which the heat flows, that cause this diversity. It is the same with light, which is turned into various colors according to the forms into which it flows. Some colors are beautiful and pleasing, and some are ugly and dull; and yet the light is the same. The same is true of the influx of spiritual heat, which in itself is love, and of spiritual light, which in itself is wisdom, from the sun of the spiritual world. The forms into which they flow are what cause the diversity, and not that heat which is love, and that light which is wisdom, in themselves. The forms into which they flow are human minds. From all this it is clear that man is led and taught by the Lord alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 160 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>160. Quod vita malorum etiam sit ex eadem origine, in suo Articulo in sequentibus demonstrabitur; hic modo id per comparationem illustrabitur; a Sole mundi influit et calor et lux, ac influit similiter in arbores quae ferunt malos fructus, ut in arbores quae ferunt bonos fructus, ac similiter vegetantur et crescunt; formae, in quas calor influit, faciunt diversitatem illam, non autem calor in se. Simile est cum luce; haec variegatur in colores secundum formas, in quas influit; sunt colores pulchri et laeti, et sunt colores impulchri et tristes, et usque eadem est lux. Simile est cum influxu caloris spiritualis, qui in se est Amor, et lucis spiritualis qui in se est Sapientia, e Sole Mundi spiritualis; formae, in quas influunt, faciunt diversitatem, non autem calor ille qui est amor, et lux illa quae est sapientia, in se: formae in quas influunt, sunt mentes humanae. Ex his nunc patet, quod homo a solo Domino ducatur et doceatur. </p>
