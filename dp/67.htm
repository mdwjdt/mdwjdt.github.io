<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第67节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>67、由于人自创造时就是一个最小形式的天堂，因而是主的一个形像，并且天堂是由和天使一样多的情感构成的，每种情感在形式上都是一个人，所以可推知，圣治的不断努力是使人能在形式上成为一个天堂，因而成为主的一个形像。再者，由于这一切是通过对良善和真理的情感实现的，所以他必成为这样一种情感。因此，这是圣治的不断努力。但圣治的核心是叫人能在天堂里面的某个具体地方，或在神性天堂人里面的某个具体地方；因为如此他就在主里面了。然而，这一切只在那些能被主引入天堂的人身上实现。主因预见这一点，故也不断规定人可以被引入天堂，因为凡允许自己被引入天堂的人，都由此预备自己在天堂的地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 67</h4><p>67. Now because the human being from creation is a heaven in miniature form and therefore an image of the Lord, and because heaven consists of as many affections as there are angels, and every affection in its form is human, it follows that it is the continual object of Divine providence that a person become a heaven in form and so an image of the Lord, and as this is achieved through an affection for goodness and truth, that he become an embodiment of that affection. <p>This, therefore, is the continual object of Divine providence. But its inmost object is that a person may be in this or that place in heaven, or in this or that place in the Divine human in heaven, for thus is he in the Lord. <p>This end is achieved, however, with those whom the Lord is able to lead to heaven. And because the Lord foresees it, He also continually provides for a person's becoming such as to allow it. For everyone who allows himself to be led to heaven is thus prepared for his place in heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 67</h4><p>67. Next, since we are by creation heavens in smallest form and therefore images of the Lord, and since heaven is made up of as many desires as there are angels, each of which is a person as to its form, it follows that the constant effort in divine providence is for each of us to become a heaven in form and therefore an image of the Lord. Further, since this is accomplished by means of the desire for what is good and true, it is for us to become that desire. This, then, is the constant effort in divine providence. <p>The very heart of providence, though, is that we should be in some particular place in heaven or in some particular place in the divine heavenly person and therefore in the Lord. This is what happens for people whom the Lord can lead to heaven. Since the Lord foresees this, he also constantly provides for it, with the result that all of us who are allowing ourselves to be led to heaven are being prepared for our own places in heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 67</h4><p>67. Now since man by creation is a heaven in the least form, and consequently an image of the Lord, and since heaven consists of as many affections as there are angels, and each affection in its form is a man, it follows that it is the continual design of the Divine Providence that man may become a heaven in form and consequently an image of the Lord, and, since this is effected by means of the affection of good and truth, that he may become such an affection. Although this is the continual design of the Divine Providence, its inmost design is that a man may be in this or that place in heaven, or in this or that place in the Divine Heavenly Man; for thus is he in the Lord. This happens, however, only with those whom the Lord can lead to heaven; and as the Lord foresees this, He also provides continually that man may become like this; for in this way everyone who suffers himself to be led to heaven is prepared for his own place in heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 67</h4><p>67. Since, then, man by creation is a heaven in the least form, and consequently an image of the Lord, and since heaven consists of as many affections as there are angels, and each affection in its form is a man, it follows that it is the continual aim of the Divine providence that man may become a heaven in form and consequently an image of the Lord, and since this is effected by means of the affection for good and truth, that he may become such an affection. This, therefore, is the continual aim of the Divine providence. But its inmost is that man may be in this or that place in heaven, or in this or that place in the Divine heavenly man; for thus is he in the Lord. This is accomplished, however, only with those whom the Lord can lead to heaven. And as the Lord foresees this, He also provides continually that man may become such; for thereby every one who permits himself to be led to heaven is prepared for his own place in heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 67 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>67. Nunc quia homo a creatione est in minima forma coelum, et inde imago Domini; et quia coelum ex tot affectionibus, quot sunt angeli, consistit, et unaquaevis affectio in sua forma est homo, sequitur quod continuum Divinae Providentiae sit, ut homo fiat coelum in forma, et inde imago Domini, et quia hoc fit per affectionem boni et veri, ut fiat affectio illa: hoc itaque est continuum Divinae Providentiae; intimum autem ejus est, ut sit hic aut ibi in Coelo, seu hic aut ibi in Divino coelesti Homine, sic enim in Domino est. Sed hoc fit cum illis, quos Dominus ad Coelum ducere potest; et quia Dominus id praevidet, etiam continue providet ut talis fiat [ut id patiatur]; sic enim omnis, qui ad coelum se duci patitur, ad suum locum in coelo praeparatur. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: praeparatut. </p>
