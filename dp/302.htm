<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第302节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>302、对天堂里的情感和地狱里的欲望的排列令人惊奇，唯独主知道这种排列。无论在哪种情况下，它们都被划分为属和种，并被如此结合以至于行如一体。它们因被划分为属和种，故也被划分为大大小小的社群；它们因被如此结合以至于行如一体，故像人里面的一切事物那样相结合。因此，天堂在形式上就像一个美丽的人，其灵魂是神性之爱和神性智慧，因而是主。而地狱在形式上就像一个畸形的人，其灵魂是自我之爱和自我聪明，因而是魔鬼。因为地狱里没有作为唯一领主的魔鬼；被称为魔鬼的，是自我之爱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 302</h4><p>302. The ordering of affections in heaven and of lusts in hell is marvelous and known to the Lord alone. On each side they are differentiated into classes and types, and so conjoined as to act in concert. Moreover, because they are differentiated into classes and types, they are differentiated into larger and smaller associations. And because they are so conjoined as to act in concert, they are conjoined as all the constituents found in the human being are. Therefore heaven in its form is like a handsome person, whose soul is Divine love and wisdom, thus the Lord. And hell in its form is like a monstrous person, whose soul is self-love and its own intelligence, thus the devil. For there is no devil in hell who is the sole master there, but it is love of self that is so called. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 302</h4><p>302. The arrangement of desires in heaven and of obsessions in hell is astonishing: only the Lord knows it. In each case, they are differentiated into genera and species and so coordinated that they act as a unit. Since they are differentiated into genera and species, they are divided into larger and smaller communities; and since they are coordinated so as to act as a unit, they are coordinated the way everything in a person is. As a result, heaven in its form is like a beautiful person whose soul is divine love and wisdom, or the Lord. Hell in its form is like a grotesque person whose soul is self-love and self-intelligence, or the devil. There is actually no "Devil" who is the sole lord in hell; that is a name for self-love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 302</h4><p>302. The arrangement of affections in heaven and of lusts in hell is wonderful, and is known to the Lord alone. In each case they are distinguished into genera and species, and are so conjoined as to act as one. Because they are distinguished into genera and species they are distinguished into greater and lesser societies; and because they are so conjoined as to act as one they are conjoined like all the things that are in man. Hence heaven in its form is like a beautiful man, whose soul is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, thus the Lord; and hell in its form is like a monstrous man, whose soul is self-love and his own intelligence, thus the devil; for there is no devil who is sole lord there, but the love of self is called the devil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 302</h4><p>302. The arrangement of affections in heaven and of lusts in hell is wonderful, and is known to the Lord alone. In each they are distinguished into genera and species, and are so conjoined as to act as one. And because they are distinguished into genera and species they are distinguished into societies greater and less; and because they are so conjoined as to act as one they are conjoined like all the things that are in man. Consequently heaven in its form is like a beautiful man, whose soul is the Divine love and Divine wisdom, thus the Lord; and hell in its form is like a monstrous man, whose soul is the love of self and self-intelligence, thus the devil; for there is no devil who is sole lord there, but the love of self is called the devil. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 302 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>302. Ordinatio affectionum in Coelo, et concupiscentiarum in inferno, est mirabilis, et soli Domino nota; sunt utrinque distinctae in genera et species, ac ita conjunctae ut unum agant; et quia distinctae sunt in genera et species, distinctae sunt in societates majores et minores; et quia conjunctae sunt ut unum agant, conjunctae sunt sicut omnia quae apud hominem sunt; inde Coelum in sua forma est sicut homo pulcher, cujus anima est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, ita Dominus; ac Infernum in sua forma est sicut homo monstrosus, cujus anima est amor sui et propria intelligentia, ita diabolus: non enim est aliquis diabolus, qui solus est dominus ibi, sed amor sui ita vocatur. </p>
