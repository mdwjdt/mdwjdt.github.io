<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>207、圣治来自何处，它是什么。它就是在人里面逐出自我之爱的神性运作。因为如前所述（206节），自我之爱是魔鬼；它的欲望及其享受是它王国的邪恶，也就是地狱。一旦这爱被逐出，主与对邻之爱的情感就会进入，并打开屋顶的窗户，然后打开两边墙上的窗户，使人能看到天堂是真实存在的，死后生命和永恒的幸福也是真实存在的。通过那时一起流入的属灵之光和属灵之爱，主使人能承认，神通过祂的圣治掌管一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 207</h4><p>207. The origin and nature of Divine providence: Divine providence is the Divine operation in a person who has set aside love of self. For a love of self is, as we said, the devil, and its lusts and their delights are the evils of its kingdom, which is hell. When this love has been set aside, the Lord enters with the affections of a love for the neighbor, and He opens the window overhead and then the windows to the sides, and enables the person to see that there is a heaven, a life after death, and eternal happiness. And by the spiritual light flowing in, and at the same time spiritual love, He causes the person to acknowledge that by His Divine providence God governs all things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 207</h4><p>207. Where divine providence comes from and what it is. It is Divinity working among us, banishing our love for ourselves. As already noted [<a href="206.htm">206</a>], love for ourselves is the devil, and its cravings and their pleasures are the evils of its kingdom, hell. Once this has been banished, the Lord comes in with impulses of love for our neighbor. He opens the skylights and then the windows in our walls and enables us to see that heaven is real, that there is a life after death, and that there is eternal happiness. By the spiritual light and the spiritual love that then flow in together, he enables us to recognize that through his divine providence, God is taking care of everything. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 207</h4><p>207. Whence the Divine Providence is and what it is. It is the Divine operation in the man who has removed the love of self; for, as has been said, the love of self is the devil; and lusts with their delights are the evils of his kingdom, which is hell. When this love has been removed the Lord enters with the affections of neighbourly love, and opens the window on the roof and then the side windows, and causes man to see that there is a heaven, a life after death and eternal happiness; and by means of the spiritual light and at the same time the spiritual love which then flow in He causes him to acknowledge that God by His Divine Providence governs all things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 207</h4><p>207. Whence the Divine providence is and what it is. It is the Divine operation in man that takes away the love of self; for, as just said, the love of self is the devil; and lusts and their enjoyment are the evils of his kingdom, which is hell. When that love has been taken away the Lord enters with affections of love of the neighbor, and opens the roof-window, and then the side-windows, and enables man to see that there is a heaven, a life after death, and eternal happiness; and by means of the spiritual light together with the spiritual love then flowing in He enables man to acknowledge that God governs all things by His Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 207 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>207. UNDE ET QUID Divina Providentia; est Divina operatio apud hominem, qui amorem sui removit; amor enim sui est, ut dictum est, diabolus, ac concupiscentiae et harum jucunda sunt mala regni ejus, quod est infernum: quo remoto intrat Dominus cum affectionibus amoris proximi, et aperit fenestram tecti ejus, et dein fenestras laterum, et facit ut videat quod coelum sit, quod vita post mortem, et quod aeterna felicitas; et per lucem spiritualem et simul per amorem spiritualem tunc influentes, facit illum agnoscere, quod Deus per Divinam suam Providentiam regat omnia. </p>
