<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第60节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>60、⑷一个无限和永恒的形像就存在于由得救的人类组成的天使天堂中。天使天堂也是我们需要知道的事之一。凡有宗教信仰的人都会思想它，想到那里去。然而，天堂只被赐予那些认识通往天堂的路并行在其中的人。通过了解那些构成天堂之人的性质，认识到没有人能成为天使，也就是进入天堂，除非他从世上带来某种天使品质，我们就能在某种程度上认识通往天堂的路。由于行在这条路上而对它的认识并通过对它的认识而行在这条路上，就存在于天使的品质中。此外，灵界确实有各种路，既有通往每个天堂社群的路，也有通往每个地狱社群的路；那里的每个人都貌似凭自己看见自己的路。他看见这条路，是因为每种爱在那里都有一条路；爱打开这条路，并将一个人引到他的同伴那里。除了自己的爱之路以外，谁也看不见其它路。由此清楚可知，天使无非是天堂之爱，否则，他们不会看见通往天堂的路。等到描述天堂时，这一点会看得更全面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 60</h4><p>60. (4) An image of the infinite and eternal is evident in the angelic heaven. Among the things people need to know about is also the angelic heaven, for everyone who has any religion thinks about it and wishes to go there. Yet heaven is granted only to those who know the way to it and walk in that way. This way can be known to some extent, too, from knowing the character of those who constitute heaven, and from knowing that no one becomes an angel or comes into heaven except one who brings an angelic character with him from the world. Present in an angelic character, moreover, is a knowledge of the way from walking in it, and a walking in the way through a knowledge of it. <p>The spiritual world also has in it actual paths which lead to every society of heaven and to every society of hell; and everyone sees his own path as though of himself. He sees it because there are paths there for every love, and love reveals the path and leads a person to his fellows. No one sees any other paths than those of his own love. <p>It is apparent from this that angels are simply embodiments of heavenly loves, for otherwise they would not have seen the paths leading to heaven. But this can be better seen from a description of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 60</h4><p>60. 4. There is a clear image of what is infinite and eternal in the angelic heaven. The angelic heaven is also one of the things we need to know about. Every religious person thinks about it and wants to go there. Heaven, though, is granted only to people who know the path to it and follow that path. We can know the path to heaven to some extent simply by considering what the people who make up heaven are like, realizing that no one can become an angel or get to heaven unless he or she arrives bringing along some angelic quality from the world. Inherent in that angelic quality is a knowing of the path from having walked it and a walking in the path from the knowing of it. <p>There really are paths in the spiritual world, paths that lead to each community of heaven and to each community of hell. We all see our own paths, spontaneously, it seems. We see them because the paths there are for the loves of each individual. Love opens the paths and leads us to our kindred spirits. No one sees any paths except those of her or his love. <p>We can see from this that angels are simply heavenly loves, since otherwise they would not have seen the paths that lead to heaven. However, this is better supported by a description of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 60</h4><p>60. IV. AN IMAGE OF THE INFINITE AND ETERNAL IS PRESENTED IN AN ANGELIC HEAVEN. Among the things of which it is necessary to have some knowledge is also the angelic heaven; for everyone who has any religion thinks about heaven and wishes to go there. Heaven, however, is granted to none but those who know the way to it and who walk therein. This way can in some measure be known from a knowledge of the character of those who constitute heaven, and also by knowing that no one becomes an angel, that is, comes into heaven, unless he carries with him from the world something of the angelic character; and in this there is present a knowledge of the way from walking in it, and a walking in the way through a knowledge of it. Moreover, in the spiritual world there are actually ways which lead to every society of heaven and to every society of hell, and each one, as if from himself, sees his own way. He sees it because there are ways there, one for every love; and love opens the way, and leads him to his fellows; nor does anyone see other ways than the way of his own love. From this it is clear that angels are nothing but heavenly loves, for otherwise they would not have seen the ways leading to heaven. This, however, may be more evident from a description of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 60</h4><p>60. (4) An image of the Infinite and Eternal is presented in the angelic heaven. Among the things we need to know about is the angelic heaven; for every one who has any religion thinks about it, and wishes to go there. But heaven is granted only to those who know the way to it and walk in that way. And that way can to some extent be known by knowing the character of those who constitute heaven, also by knowing that no one becomes an angel, that is, comes into heaven, unless he carries with him from the world what is angelic; and in what is angelic there is present a knowledge of the way from walking in it, and a walking in the way through a knowledge of it. Moreover, in the spiritual world, there are actually ways that lead to every society of heaven and to every society of hell; and there each one as if from himself sees his own way. He sees it because there is a way there for every love; and the love opens the way and leads one to his fellows. Other ways than the way of his love no one sees. From this it is clear that angels are nothing but heavenly loves, for otherwise they would not have seen the ways leading to heaven. But this can be more fully seen when heaven is described. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 60 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>60. IV. Quod imago Infiniti ac Aeterni exstet in Coelo angelico. Inter scitu necessaria est quoque Coelum angelicum, unusquisque enim, cui est religio, id cogitat, et illuc venire vult; sed coelum non datur aliis, quam qui sciunt viam ad illud, et ambulant illam; haec via etiam aliquantum sciri potest ex cognitione, quales sunt qui constituunt coelum, et quod nemo angelus fiat, seu in coelum veniat, nisi qui angelicum secum e mundo fert, et angelico inest cognitio viae ex ambulatione ejus, et ambulatio viae per cognitionem ejus. In Mundo spirituali etiam actualiter sunt viae, quae tendunt ad unamquamvis societatem coeli, et ad unamquamvis inferni; et quisque videt suam viam sicut ex se; quod videat, est quia viae ibi sunt pro unoquovis amore, et amor aperit illam, et ducit ad consocios; alias vias quam sui amoris nemo videt: ex quo patet, quod angeli non sint nisi quam amores coelestes, nam alioquin non vidissent vias ad coelum tendentes. Sed hoc melius constare potest ex descriptione Coeli. </p>
