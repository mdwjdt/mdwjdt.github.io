<h4 align="center"></h4><p>138、⑷没有人能在缺乏理性和自由的状态下被改造。前面（78-81节）说明，除了人出于自由照着理性所做的外，没有什么东西能成为他的一部分。这是因为自由属于意愿，理性属于理解力。当人出于自由照着理性行动时，他就是出于意愿通过理解力行动；凡结合在一起的两者所行的，都会成为人的一部分。既然主的旨意是人要被改造和重生，以便他可以拥有永生或天堂的生命，并且没有人能被改造和重生，除非良善被归给他的意愿，以至于好像是他自己的，真理被归给他的理解力，以至于也好像是他自己的；既然除了出于意愿的自由照着理性所做的外，没有什么东西能被归给任何人，那么可推知，没有人能在缺乏理性和自由的状态下被改造。缺乏自由和理性的状态有很多，但它们一般可归纳为以下几类：恐惧、不幸或突发事件、精神疾病、严重的身体疾病和理解力瞎眼的状态。我需要详细说明每种状态的情况。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 138</h4><p>138. (4) No one is reformed in states devoid of rationality and freedom. We showed above that nothing becomes attached to a person except what he does in freedom in accordance with his reason. That is because freedom is a faculty of the will, and reason a faculty of the intellect; and when a person acts in freedom in accordance with his reason, he then acts from his will by means of his intellect, and what results in a union of the two becomes attached to him. <p>Now because the Lord wills a person's reformation and regeneration in order that the person may attain eternal life or the life of heaven, and because no one can be reformed and regenerated unless good attaches itself to his will so as to be seemingly his, and truth to his intellect so as to be seemingly his as well, and because it is impossible that anything become attached to anyone other than what he does in the freedom of his will in accordance with the reason of his intellect, it follows that no one is reformed in states devoid of freedom and rationality. <p>States devoid of freedom and rationality are of many kinds, but they may be assigned in general to the following: states of fear, of misfortune, of mental illness, of physical illness, of ignorance, and of intellectual blindness. However, we will say something in particular about each of these states. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 138</h4><p>138. 4. No one is reformed in states where freedom and rationality are absent. I have already explained [<a href="78.htm">78-81</a>] that nothing becomes part of us except what we do in freedom and in accord with reason. This is because freedom is a matter of our volition and reason is a matter of our discernment. When we do something in freedom and in accord with reason, then we do it of our own volition by means of our own discernment, and whatever is done by these two united becomes part of us. <p>Since the Lord wants us to be reformed and reborn in order to have eternal life, or the life of heaven, and since we cannot be reformed and regenerated unless goodness is taken into our volition as part of it and truth is taken into our discernment as part of it, and since nothing can become part of us except what is done of our own free volition and in accord with our own rational discernment, it follows that no one is reformed in states that lack freedom and rationality. <p>There are many states that lack freedom and rationality, but in general they can be assigned to the following categories: states of fear, emergency, mental illness, serious physical illness, ignorance, and intellectual blindness. I need to say something specific about each of these states. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 138</h4><p>138. IV. NO ONE IS REFORMED IN STATES THAT ARE NOT OF RATIONALITY AND LIBERTY. It was shown above that nothing is appropriated to man except what he does from freedom according to reason. This is because freedom belongs to the will and reason to the understanding; and when man acts from freedom according to reason he acts from the will by means of his understanding; and that which is done when these two are united is appropriated to him. Now since the Lord wills that man should be reformed and regenerated in order that he may have eternal life or the life of heaven; and since no one can be reformed and regenerated unless good is appropriated to his will so as to be as it were his own, and truth is appropriated to his understanding also to be as his own; and since nothing can be appropriated to anyone except what is done from freedom of the will according to reason, it follows that no one is reformed in states that are not of liberty and rationality. There are many such states, but in general they may be referred to the following: states of fear, misfortune, mental disorder (animus), bodily disease, ignorance and blindness of the understanding. Something shall be said of each state in particular. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 138</h4><p>138. (4) No one is reformed in states that do not spring from rationality and liberty. It has been shown above that nothing is appropriated to man except what he does from freedom in accordance with reason. This is because freedom belongs to the will and reason to the understanding; and when man acts from freedom in accordance with reason he acts from the will by means of his understanding; and whatever is done in a conjunction of these two is appropriated. Since, then, it is the Lord's will that man should be reformed and regenerated, that he may have eternal life or the life of heaven, and no one can be reformed and regenerated unless good is so appropriated to his will as to be as if it were his, and truth is so appropriated to his understanding as to be as if it were his, and since nothing can be appropriated to any one except what is done from freedom of the will in accordance with the reason of the understanding, it follows that no one is reformed in states that do not spring from liberty and rationality. These states are many, but in general they may be referred to the following, namely states of fear, of misfortune, of disordered mind, of bodily disease, of ignorance, and of blindness of the understanding. Something shall be said of each state in particular. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 138 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>138. IV. Quod <sup>1</sup>nemo reformetur in statibus non rationalitatis et non libertatis; <sup>2</sup>supra ostensum est, quod nihil approprietur homini, nisi quod ille ex libero secundum rationem agit; causa est, quia liberum est voluntatis, et ratio est intellectus, et cum homo ex libero secundum rationem agit, tunc ex voluntate per suum intellectum agit, et quod fit in conjunctione utriusque, hoc appropriatur. Nunc quia Dominus vult, ut homo reformetur et regeneretur, ut ei vita aeterna seu vita coeli sit, et nemo reformari ac regenerari potest, nisi bonum approprietur ejus voluntati ut sit sicut ejus, ac verum ejus intellectui ut quoque sit sicut ejus, et quia nihil appropriari potest alicui, nisi quod ex libero voluntatis secundum rationem intellectus fit, sequitur quod <sup>3</sup>nemo reformetur in statibus non libertatis et non rationalitatis. <sup>4</sup>Status non libertatis et non rationalitatis sunt plures; sed referri possunt in genere ad hos, ad status timoris, infortunii, aegritudinis animi, morbi corporis, ignorantiae, et occaecationis intellectus; sed de unoquovis statu aliquid in specie dicetur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: Quod<p>2 Prima editio: lihertatis;<p>3 Prima editio: qnod<p>4 Prima editio: rationalitatis, </p>
