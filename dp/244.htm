<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第244节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>244、④大卫数点百姓，结果一场瘟疫降与他们，导致七万人死亡；而神不在事前，却在事后差遣先知迦得见大卫，宣布处罚。凡确认反对圣治的人对此可能有各种想法和思考。他们尤其会追问为何百姓因王的过犯而受到如此严厉的惩罚。没有事先警告大卫，符合已阐述的圣治律法，尤其符合129-153节和154-174节所解释的那两条律法。由于王的过犯而严厉惩罚这百姓，以及用瘟疫击杀七万人，与王无关，与百姓有关。因为经上说：<p>耶和华又向以色列发怒，就激动大卫来对付他们，说，去，数点以色列和犹大。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">（撒母耳记下24:1）</a></p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 244</h4><p>244. (4) That David numbered the people, and in consequence a pestilence was sent upon them, as a result of which so many thousands of the people died, and that God did not send the prophet Gad to him and pronounce the punishment beforehand but only afterward: One who confirms himself against Divine providence may entertain and consider various explanations for this also, especially as to why David was not warned beforehand, and why the people should be so grievously punished for the king's transgression. <p>That David was not warned beforehand accords with the laws of Divine providence that we have established so far, especially with the two explained above in nos. <a href="129.htm">129-153</a> and nos. <a href="154.htm">154-174</a>. <p>That the people were so grievously punished for the king's transgression and seventy thousand stricken with pestilence was not the king's fault but the people's, for we read, <p>Again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; (therefore) He incited David against them, saying, "Go, number Israel and Judah." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 244</h4><p>244. 4. Because David had taken a census of the people, a plague was sent and thousands of people died; and God did not send Gad the prophet to announce the punishment beforehand but only after the fact. Various thoughts and ruminations about this may occur to people who resolutely deny divine providence. They may ask particularly why David was not warned in advance and why the people were punished so severely for David's transgression. <p>The reason he was not warned in advance comes under laws of divine providence already presented, especially the two explained in <a href="129.htm">129-153</a>, <a href="154.htm">154</a>-<a href="174.htm">174</a>. The reason the people were punished so severely for the transgression of their king (seventy thousand were struck by the plague) had to do not with the king but with the people, since it says, "Jehovah became more angry with Israel, so he prompted David against them by saying, 'Go, number Israel and Judah'" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 244</h4><p>244. 4. David numbered the people, and in consequence a pestilence was sent upon them, by which so many thousands of men perished, and God, not before but after the deed, sent the prophet Gad to him and announced punishment upon him. He who confirms himself against the Divine Providence may have various thoughts and reflections about this also, asking particularly why David was not first warned and why the people were so severely punished for the king's transgression. That he was not first warned is in accordance with the laws of the Divine Providence already set forth, especially in accordance with the two explained <sup>1</sup>above in numbers <a href="129.htm">129-153</a>, and numbers <a href="154.htm">154-174</a>. That the people were so severely punished for the king's transgression, and seventy thousand cut off by the pestilence, was not owing to the king but to the people; for it is written,<p>Again the anger of JEHOVAH was kindled against Israel, and He moved David against them saying (A.V. to say), Go, number Israel and Judah. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>.).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Original Edition has "contra;" the translation requires "secundum." </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 244</h4><p>244. (4) David numbered the people, and in consequence a plague was sent upon them, by which so many thousands of men perished; and God, not before but after the deed, sent Gad the prophet to David, and denounced punishment upon him. Whoever confirms himself against the Divine providence may have various thoughts and reflections about this also, especially why David was not admonished in advance, and why the people were so severely punished for the king's transgression. His not having been admonished in advance is in accordance with the laws of Divine providence already set forth, especially the two explained from<a href="129.htm">129-153</a>, and from<a href="154.htm">154-174</a>. This severe punishment of the people on account of the king's transgression, and the smiting of seventy thousand with the plague, was not for the king's sake but for the people's sake. For it is said, <p>Again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; therefore He moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 244 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>244. IV. Quod David numeraverit populum, <sup>1</sup>et propterea immissa sit pestis, ex qua tot millia hominum perierunt, et quod Deus non ante sed post factum ad illum miserit Gadem prophetam, et ei denuntiaverit poenam: qui se contra Divinam Providentiam confirmat, potest etiam de hoc varia cogitare et volvere, imprimis cur David non prius admonitus fuerit, et cur populus propter transgressionem Regis tam graviter punitus sit. Quod non prius admonitus fuerit, est secundum leges Divinae Providentiae hactenus demonstratas, imprimis secundum <sup>2</sup>binas supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_244/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_129">129-153</a> <sup>3</sup>, et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_244/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_154">154-174</a> explicatas: quod populus propter transgressionem Regis tam graviter punitus sit, et septuaginta millia peste percussi sint, non fuit propter Regem, sed propter populum; nam legitur, "Addidit ira Jehovae <sup>4</sup>excandescere contra Israelem, ideo incitavit Davidem contra illos <sup>5</sup>dicendo, abi, numera Israelem et Jehudam," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_244/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_24_1">II Samuelis 24:1</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: papulum,<p>2 Prima editio: contra<p>3 Prima editio: 153;<p>4 Prima editio: Jehouae<p>5 Prima editio: ilos </p>
