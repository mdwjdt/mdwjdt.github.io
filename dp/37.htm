<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 37</h4><p>37. (4) The more closely a person is conjoined with the Lord, the happier he becomes. Similar statements to what we said above in nos. <a href="32.htm">32</a> and <a href="34.htm">34</a> regarding the degrees of life and wisdom in the measure of one's conjunction with the Lord can be said also of degrees of happiness. For states of happiness, or of bliss and delight, ascend as the higher degrees of the mind called spiritual and celestial are opened in a person, and after his life in the world these degrees grow to eternity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 37</h4><p>37. 4. The more closely we are united to the Lord, the happier we become. We can say much the same about levels of happiness as was said above (<a href="32.htm">32</a> and <a href="34.htm">34</a>) about levels of life and wisdom that depend on our union with the Lord. These times of happiness, bliss, and sheer delight intensify as the higher levels of our minds are opened within us, the levels we call spiritual and heavenly. Once our life on earth is over, these levels keep rising forever. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 37</h4><p>37. IV. THE MORE NEARLY A MAN IS CONJOINED TO THE LORD THE HAPPIER HE BECOMES. The same may be said of the degrees of happiness as was said above in nos. <a href="32.htm">32</a> and <a href="34.htm">34</a> of the degrees of life and wisdom according to conjunction with the Lord. For happiness, or states of blessedness and joy, become more exalted as the higher degrees of the mind, <sup>1</sup>which are called the spiritual and the celestial, are opened in man; and after his life in the world these degrees continue to develop to eternity.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Mind is the general translation of mens. When mens and animus are used in contrast, mens is the higher plane of the mind in which will and understanding are rationally active, while animus is the lower plane of the mind in which desires and ideas in connection with the body are active. When animus is used in this connection the word mind is followed by (animus) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 37</h4><p>37. (4) The more nearly a man is conjoined with the Lord the happier he becomes. About the degrees of happiness the same may be said as has been said above (<a href="32.htm">32</a>, <a href="34.htm">34</a>), about the degrees of life and of wisdom in the measure of conjunction with the Lord. For happiness, that is, beatitudes and pleasures, are exalted as the higher degrees of the mind, which are called spiritual and celestial, are opened in man; and after his life in the world these degrees are enlarged to eternity. </p> 
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 37 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>37. IV. Quod homo quo propius conjungitur Domino, eo felicior fiat. Similia quae supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_37/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_32">32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_37/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_34">34</a> de Gradibus vitae et sapientiae secundum conjunctionem cum Domino, <sup>1</sup>dicta sunt, etiam de gradibus felicitatis dici possunt; ascendunt enim felicitates, <sup>2</sup>seu beatitudines et jucunditates, sicut aperiuntur gradus superiores mentis, qui vocantur spiritualis et coelestis, <sup>3</sup>apud hominem, et illi gradus post vitam ejus in mundo crescunt in aeternum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: Domiuo,<p>2 Prima editio: felicitatcs,<p>3 Prima editio: c�iestis, </p>
