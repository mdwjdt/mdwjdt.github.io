<h4 align="center"></h4><p>9、下文的多个地方将说明，爱与智慧如何在人之下或之外的事物，就是动植物界中构成一体。在此之前，必须阐明这三点：第一，在主所创造的宇宙及其一切事物里面，无论总体还是细节，都有良善与真理的婚姻。第二，创世之后，该婚姻在人里面破裂了。第三，按照圣治，已破裂的东西要构成一体，因此，良善与真理的婚姻要得以恢复。由于这三点在《圣爱与圣智》一书已充分证明，所以没有必要进一步证明。此外，每个人基于理性都能看出，如果自创世时，一切受造物里面都有良善与真理的婚姻，该婚姻后来破裂了，那么主必不断作工恢复它。这意味着它的恢复，因而受造宇宙通过人而与主的结合，必是圣治的一个目标。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 9</h4><p>9. But how these two are united in forms lower than or apart from mankind, both in forms found in the animal kingdom and in forms found in the plant kingdom - this we will speak of here and there in subsequent discussions, to which must be premised the following three points: <p>First, that in the universe and in each and all of its constituents that the Lord created, there was a marriage of good and truth. <p>Second, that following creation this marriage was sundered in mankind. <p>Third, that it is a goal of Divine providence that what has been separated become united, and thus that a marriage of good and truth be restored. <p>We have provided many confirmations of these three points in our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, and therefore we have no need to provide further confirmation. Moreover, everyone can see in accord with reason that, given that a marriage of good and truth existed from creation in every created thing, and given that this marriage was afterward sundered, the Lord continually works to restore it, consequently that its restoration and by it a conjunction of the created universe with the Lord through mankind is a goal of Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 9</h4><p>9. As for the way love and wisdom form a unity in things beneath or outside us--in the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom--this will come up throughout the following pages. I may mention three things by way of preface. First, there was a marriage of goodness and truth in the universe and in absolutely everything in it that the Lord created. Second, this marriage was broken up in us after creation. Third, it is a goal of divine providence that what has been broken apart should become a whole and therefore that the marriage of goodness and truth should be restored. <p>These three propositions have been given ample support in Divine Love and Wisdom, so there is no need of further support. Then too, everyone can see on the basis of reason that if there was a marriage of goodness and truth in everything that was created and this marriage was later broken up, the Lord would be constantly working for its restoration. This means that its restoration and therefore the union of the created universe with the Lord by means of us must be a goal of divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 9</h4><p>9. How these make one in things below or external to man, both in those of the animal kingdom and in those of the vegetable kingdom, will be shown in many places in what follows. Before this is done these three things must be set forth: First. In the universe, and in all things in general and in particular therein which were created by the Lord, there was a marriage of good and truth. Second. After creation, this marriage was severed in man. Third. It is of the Divine Providence that what has been severed should be made one, and thus that the marriage of good and truth should be restored. As these three premises are fully confirmed in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, further proof is unnecessary. Moreover, everyone may see from reason that as there was from creation a marriage of good and truth in every created thing, and as this marriage was afterwards severed, the Lord is constantly working to restore it; and therefore that its restoration, and the consequent conjunction of the created universe with the Lord through man, is of the Divine Providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 9</h4><p>9. How these make a one in things below man or outside of him, both those in the animal kingdom and those in the vegetable kingdom, will be told further on. Here three things must be premised: First, In the universe and in each thing and all things of it, which the Lord created, there was a marriage of good and truth. Second, After creation, this marriage was severed in man. Third, It is the end of Divine providence that what is severed shall become one, and thus the marriage of good and truth be restored. As these three things are fully shown in the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, further proof is unnecessary. Moreover, any one can see from reason that as there was by creation a marriage of good and truth in every created thing, and as this marriage was afterwards severed, the Lord must be continually working to restore it, and therefore its restoration, and the consequent conjunction of the created universe with the Lord through man, must be the end of Divine providence. </p> 
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 9 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>9. Quomodo autem illa unum faciunt in illis quae infra seu extra hominem sunt, tam in illis quae in Regno animali, quam in Regno vegetabili sunt, in sequentibus passim dicetur; quibus haec tria praemittenda sunt: PRIMUM, Quod in universo et in omnibus et singulis ejus, quae creata sunt a Domino, fuerit conjugium boni et veri. SECUNDUM, <sup>1</sup>quod id conjugium post creationem apud hominem separatum sit. TERTIUM, <sup>2</sup>Quod Divinae Providentiae sit, ut quod separatum est, unum fiat, et sic ut conjugium boni et veri restauretur. Haec tria multis confirmata sunt in Transactione de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA, quare ulterius confirmare illa, non opus est: quisque etiam ex ratione videre potest, quod dum conjugium boni et veri a creatione fuerat in omni creato, et dum hoc postea separatum est, Dominus continue operetur, ut illud restauretur; consequenter, quod restauratio ejus, et inde conjunctio universi creati cum Domino per hominem, sit Divinae Providentiae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: SECUNDUM;<p>2 Prima editio: TERTIUM; </p>
