<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第62节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>62、天使天堂就是一个无限和永恒的形像，因为它是主的一个形像，而主是无限和永恒。祂的无限和永恒的一个形像体现在这方面：天堂由大量天使组成；它是由和那里的天堂之爱的总体情感一样多的社群构成的；每个社群里的每位天使都明显是他自己的情感；天堂的形式在主面前为一，就像一个人为一那样。该形式是由所有这些总体和具体的情感构成的，并且随着数量增加而得以完善，直到永远，因为进入神性之爱的形式，也就是形式中的形式的人数目越多，这种联合体就变得越完善。由此很清楚地看出，一个无限和永恒的形像就呈现在天使天堂中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 62</h4><p>62. We say that the angelic heaven is an image of the infinite and eternal because it is an image of the Lord, and the Lord is infinite and eternal. An image of His infinity and eternity is apparent in the fact that heaven consists of millions of angels, that they form as many societies as there are general affections of heavenly love, and that each angel in each society is the distinct embodiment of his own particular affection. It is apparent also in this, that the form of heaven consists of so many affections, in general and in particular, a form which in the Lord's sight is as though a single unit, just as a person is a unit, and that this form is perfected to eternity with the increase in numbers; for the more who enter into the form of Divine love, which is the supreme form, the more perfect the union becomes. <p>It is clearly apparent from this that an image of the infinite and eternal is evident in the angelic heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 62</h4><p>62. The reason the angelic heaven is an image of what is infinite and eternal is that it is an image of the Lord, who is the Infinite and Eternal One. We can see an image of his infinite and eternal nature in the fact that there are millions of angels who make up heaven, and that they make up as many communities as there are general desires of heavenly love, with each individual angel in each community being quite clearly his or her own desire. The form of heaven is made up of all these general and specific desires, a form that is like a single being in the Lord's sight just the way a person is a single being. This form is becoming more perfect to eternity as its numbers increase, because the more people there are who are participating in the form of divine love, which is the form of forms, the more perfect is the union. <p>We can see quite plainly from this that there is an image of what is infinite and eternal in the angelic heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 62</h4><p>62. The angelic heaven is an image of the Infinite and Eternal because it is an image of the Lord, and the Lord is the Infinite and Eternal. An image of the Infinite and Eternal itself appears in this, that heaven is composed of myriads of myriads of angels, consisting of as many societies as there are general affections of heavenly love; that every angel in each society is distinctly his own affection; that the form of heaven, which is before the Lord as one, just as a man is one, is from so many affections in general and in particular; and that this form is perfected to eternity according to the increase in numbers, for the more numerous they are who enter into the form of the Divine Love, which is the Form of forms, the more perfect the union becomes. From these considerations it is clearly evident that an image of the Infinite and Eternal is presented in the angelic heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 62</h4><p>62. The angelic heaven is an image of the Infinite and Eternal because it is an image of the Lord, and the Lord is the Infinite and Eternal. An image of His Infinite and Eternal is manifest in this, that heaven is made up of myriads of myriads of angels; and that it is made up of as many societies as there are general affections of heavenly love; and that each angel in each society is distinctly his own affection; and that the form of heaven, which before the Lord is as one, just as a man is one, is from so great a number of affections in general and in particular; and that this form is perfected to eternity according to the increase of numbers, for the greater the number of those that enter into the form of the Divine love, which is the form of forms, the more perfect the unity becomes. From all this it is very clear that an image of the Infinite and Eternal is presented in the angelic heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 62 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>62. Quod Coelum angelicum sit imago Infiniti ac Aeterni, est quia est imago Domini, ac Dominus est Infinitus et Aeternus. Imago Infiniti ac Aeterni Ipsius apparet in eo, quod myriades myriadum angelorum sint, ex quibus coelum, et quod totidem societates constituant, quot sunt affectiones communes Amoris coelestis, et quod unusquisque angelus in quavis societate sit distincte sua affectio; et quod ex tot affectionibus in communi et in particulari sit Forma Coeli, quae est sicut unum coram Domino, non aliter quam sicut homo est unum; et quod haec Forma in aeternum perficiatur secundum pluralitatem, nam quo plures formam Amoris Divini, quae est Forma formarum, intrant, eo fit unio perfectior. Ex his manifeste patet, quod imago Infiniti ac Aeterni exstet in Coelo angelico. </p>
