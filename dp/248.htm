<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第248节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>248、至此，我已经解释了前面<a href="236.htm">（236节）</a>所列举的例子，属世人或唯物主义者，就是推理者会利用取自圣言的这些例子来确认反对圣治。因为如前所述，这种人无论看见、听见或读到什么，都能拿来当作反对圣治的论据。然而，很少有人拿圣言经文来确认反对圣治；许多人都是拿发生在他们眼前的事来如此行，如237节所列出的那些事；现在，我以同样方式解释它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 248</h4><p>248. So far we have explained the considerations enumerated above in no. 236, which are some of the instances from the Word by which the natural person reasoning naturally may confirm himself against Divine providence. For, as we said before, a person of that character can take whatever he sees, hears or reads as an argument against it. Few, however, confirm themselves against Divine providence on the basis of such things as are found in the Word. Many more do so because of events that occur before their eyes, such as those contained in no. <a href="237.htm">237</a>, which we will likewise now explain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 248</h4><p>248. So far, I have been explaining the instances listed in <a href="236.htm">236</a> above, instances from the Word that materialists may use to support their reasoning against divine providence, because as already noted [<a href="235.htm">235</a>] anything such people see or hear or read they can use as arguments against it. However, relatively few people justify their rejection of divine providence by passages from the Word. Most of them draw on what meets their eyes; and it is the list of these in <a href="237.htm">237</a> that will now be explained in the same way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 248</h4><p>248. An explanation has now been given of the points enumerated above in n. <a href="236.htm">236</a>. These are some of the instances from the Word by which the natural man who exercises his reason may confirm himself against the Divine Providence. For, as was said above, whatever such a man sees, hears and reads, he can employ as an argument against the Divine Providence. Few, however, confirm themselves against the Divine Providence from such things as are in the Word; but many do so from things that appear before their eyes, as those mentioned in n. <a href="237.htm">237</a>; and these will now in like manner be explained. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 248</h4><p>248. This is an explanation of the things enumerated above (in<a href="236.htm">236</a>), which are some of the things from the Word by which a natural man who is a reasoner can confirm himself against the Divine providence. For whatever such a man sees, hears, or reads, as has been said, he can employ as an argument against the Divine providence. There are few, however, who confirm themselves against the Divine providence from such things as are in the Word; but many do so from things that take place before their eyes, such as are mentioned in<a href="237.htm">237</a>, which will now likewise be explained. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 248 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>248. Hactenus explicata sunt illa quae supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_248/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_236">236</a> recensita sunt, quae sunt aliqua ex Verbo per quae homo naturalis ratiocinator contra Divinam Providentiam se confirmare potest; nam, ut prius dictum, quicquid talis homo videt, audit et legit, potest pro argumento sumere contra illam: at pauci contra Divinam Providentiam se confirmant ex talibus quae in Verbo sunt; plures vero ex illis quae coram oculis exstant, quae sunt <sup>1</sup>quae <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_248/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_237">237</a> continentur, quae nunc similiter explicanda sunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: snnt </p>
