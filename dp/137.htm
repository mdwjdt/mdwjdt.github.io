<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第137节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>137、这一切清楚表明强制敬拜和非强制敬拜各是何性质。强制敬拜是属肉体的，毫无生气，是黑暗和悲伤的。它是属肉体的，因为它吸引身体，不吸引心灵；它毫无生气，因为它里面没有生命；它是黑暗的，因为它里面没有理解力；它是悲伤的，因为它里面没有天堂的快乐。而另一方面，当非强制敬拜是真诚的时，它是属灵的，有生气，是明亮而又快乐的。它是属灵的，因为它里面有来自主的灵；它有生气，因为它里面有来自主的生命；它是明亮的，因为它里面有来自主的智慧；它是快乐的，因为它里面有来自主的天堂。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 137</h4><p>137. From this the nature of coerced worship can be seen and the nature of worship not coerced. Coerced worship is physical worship, lifeless, hazy, and mournful. It is physical because it is a worship of the body and not of the mind; lifeless because it has no life in it; hazy because it is without understanding; and mournful because it lacks any delight of heaven in it. <p>On the other hand, worship not coerced, when genuine, is spiritual worship, alive, lucid, and joyful. It is spiritual because it has in it a spirit from the Lord; alive because it has in it life from the Lord; lucid because it has in it wisdom from the Lord; and joyful because it has in it heaven from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 137</h4><p>137. This shows the nature of compulsory worship and of voluntary worship. Compulsory worship is physical, lifeless, dark, and depressing. It is physical because it engages the body but not the mind; it is lifeless because our life is not in it; it is dark because our discernment is not in it; and it is depressing because the joy of heaven is not in it. On the other hand, when voluntary worship is sincere it is spiritual, living, bright, and joyful. It is spiritual because there is a spirit from the Lord in it; it is living because there is life from the Lord in it; it is bright because there is wisdom from the Lord in it; and it is joyful because there is heaven from the Lord in it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 137</h4><p>137. From this may be evident the nature of worship that is forced and of worship that is not forced. Worship that is forced is corporeal, lifeless, vague and gloomy: corporeal because it is of the body and not of the mind, lifeless because there is no life in it, vague because there is no understanding in it, and gloomy because there is no heavenly delight in it. On the other hand, worship that is not forced, when it is genuine, is spiritual, living, clear and joyful: spiritual because there is spirit from the Lord in it, living because there is life from the Lord in it, clear because there is wisdom from the Lord in it, and joyful because there is heaven from the Lord in it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 137</h4><p>137. All this makes clear what compelled worship is and what worship not compelled is. Compelled worship is corporeal, lifeless, darkened, and sad; corporeal because it is of the body and not of the mind, lifeless because there is no life in it, darkened because there is no understanding in it, and sad because there is no enjoyment of heaven in it. But worship not compelled, when it is genuine, is spiritual, living, clear, and joyful; spiritual because there is spirit from the Lord in it, living because there is life from the Lord in it, clear because there is wisdom from the Lord in it, and joyful because there is heaven from the Lord in it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 137 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>137. Ex his constare potest, qualis est cultus coactus, et cultus non coactus: cultus coactus est cultus corporeus, inanimatus, obscurus, et tristis; corporeus quia est corporis et non mentis, inanimatus quia non vita est in illo, obscurus quia non est intellectus in illo, et tristis quia non est jucundum coeli in illo. At cultus non coactus, dum genuinus est, est cultus spiritualis, vivus, lucidus, et laetus; spiritualis quia est spiritus a Domino in illo, vivus quia est vita a Domino in illo, lucidus quia est sapientia a Domino in illo, et laetus quia est coelum a Domino in illo. </p>
