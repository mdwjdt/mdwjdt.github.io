<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第103节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>103、⑴每个人都有思维的一个外在和一个内在。此处思维的外在和内在，与外在人和内在人是一个意思，无非是指意愿和理解力的外在和内在；因为构成人的，是意愿和理解力。此外，由于意愿和理解力显现在思维中，所以我们采用了思维的外在和内在这样的术语。既然正是人的灵，而不是他的身体在意愿和理解，从而进行思考，那么可知，这外在和内在是指人之灵的外在和内在。身体活动，无论言语上的还是行为上的，无非是人之灵的内在和外在的一个结果，因为身体只是顺服。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 103</h4><p>103. (1) Every person has an external and an internal level of thought. By the external and internal levels of thought here we mean the same thing as by the external and internal self, by which we mean simply the internal and external planes of the will and intellect, for the will and intellect are what make the person. And because these two manifest themselves in a person's thoughts, we speak of the external and internal levels of thought. <p>Now, because it is not a person's body but his spirit that wills and understands and so thinks, it follows that these external and internal levels are the external and internal levels of a person's spirit. That it is the body that acts, whether in speaking or doing, is simply the effect of the internal and external levels of his spirit, for the body is merely a compliant form. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 103</h4><p>103. 1. Everyone has an inner and an outer level of thinking. Our outer and inner levels of thinking mean much the same as our outer and inner selves, which is the same as our outer and inner volition and discernment, because volition and discernment are what make us human. Further, since volition and discernment come to our consciousness in thoughts, we can speak of outer and inner levels of thinking. <p>Since it is not our bodies but our spirits that intend and discern and therefore think, it follows that this outer level and inner level are outer and inner levels of our spirit. Our physical behavior, whether in speech or in action, is nothing but an effect of the inner and outer levels of our spirits, since the body is simply obedience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 103</h4><p>103. I. EVERY MAN HAS AN EXTERNAL AND AN INTERNAL OF THOUGHT. By the external and the internal of thought are here meant the same as by the external and the internal man, and by these are meant the external and the internal of the will and of the understanding, for the will and the understanding constitute man; and as these both manifest themselves in the thoughts the terms the external and the internal of thought are used. Now, since it is not the body but the spirit of man that wills and understands and consequently thinks, it follows that this external and internal are the external and the internal of man's spirit. The action of the body, whether in word or in deed, is only an effect from the internal and the external of man's spirit; for the body is only an obedient instrument. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 103</h4><p>103. (1) Every man has an external and an internal of thought. The same is here meant by the external and internal of thought as by the external and internal man, and by this nothing else is meant than the external and internal of the will and understanding; for the will and understanding are what constitute man, and as these two manifest themselves in the thoughts, the terms external and internal of thought are used. Since, then, it is the spirit of man and not his body that wills and understands and therefore thinks, it follows that this external and internal are the external and internal of man's spirit. The action of the body, whether in words or deeds, is only an effect from the internal and external of man's spirit, since the body is mere obedience. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 103 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>103. I. Quod cuilibet homini Externum et Internum cogitationis sit. Per externum et internum cogitationis hic intelligitur simile quod per Externum et Internum hominem, per quem non aliud intelligitur quam externum et internum voluntatis ac intellectus, voluntas enim ac intellectus faciunt hominem; et quia haec duo se manifestant in cogitationibus, dicitur externum ac internum cogitationis; nunc quia non corpus hominis sed spiritus ejus vult ac intelligit, et inde cogitat, sequitur, quod hoc externum et internum sit externum et internum spiritus hominis. Quod corpus agit, sive loquatur sive faciat, est solum effectus ex interno et externo spiritus ejus, nam corpus est modo obedientia. </p>
