<h4 align="center"></h4><p>87、⑸通过这两种官能，人能被改造和重生到这种程度：他能通过它们被引导承认，他所思所行的一切良善和真理都来自主，不是来自他自己。我已经解释了（83节）何为改造，何为重生，还解释了（82-86节）人通过理性和自由这两种官能被改造和重生；由于这一切通过这两种官能实现，所以有必要对它们作进一步的说明。人从理性获得理解的能力，从自由获得意愿的能力，在这两种情况下都好像是凭他自己。然而，除了重生之人外，没有人能出于自由意愿良善，进而照着理性实行良善。恶人只能出于自由意愿邪恶，并照着他通过合理化使之看似理性的思维实行邪恶。因为邪恶能像良善一样容易被确认，不过，只能通过谬论和表象被确认。一旦被确认，这些表象就会变成虚假；凡被确认的东西都看似理性。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 87</h4><p>87. (5) A person can be reformed and regenerated by means of these two faculties to the extent that he can be led by means of them to acknowledge that every truth and good that he thinks and does originates from the Lord and not from himself. We have stated just above what reformation and regeneration are, and the fact that it is by means of these two faculties, namely rationality and freedom, that a person is reformed and regenerated. So, then, because this is accomplished by means of these faculties, we must say something further about them. <p>From rationality a person has the ability to understand, and from freedom the ability to will, each as though of himself. Yet the ability to will good in freedom, and consequently to do it in accordance with one's reason, is not possible unless the person is regenerate. An evil person can in freedom will only evil, and do it in accordance with his way of thinking, which he has made by justifications to be as though a matter of reason. For one can justify evil just as well as good, even though evil is justified by fallacies and appearances which, when affirmed, become falsities; and when evil has been justified, it appears to be as though a matter of reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 87</h4><p>87. 5. We can be reformed and regenerated by means of these two abilities to the extent that we are brought to a realization that anything good and true that we think and do comes from the Lord and not from us. I have already explained [<a href="83.htm">83</a>] what reformation and regeneration are, and have also explained [<a href="82.htm">82-86</a>] that we are reformed and regenerated by means of these two abilities, rationality and freedom. Since the change is accomplished by means of the abilities, I need to say a little more about them. <p>It is our rationality that enables us to discern and our freedom that enables us to intend, in each case apparently on our own. However, the only people who can intend what is good and do good in a rational manner are people who have been regenerated. Evil people can only intend evil freely, and do it in keeping with their thought, by rationalizations that seem to be reasonable. Evil can be justified just the way good can, but only by the use of deceptive appearances. Once these appearances are taken as certainties, they become falsities; and anything that is taken as a certainty seems to be reasonable. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 87</h4><p>87. V. BY MEANS OF THESE TWO FACULTIES MAN CAN BE SO FAR REFORMED AND REGENERATED AS HE CAN BE LED BY MEANS OF THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVERYTHING TRUE AND GOOD THAT HE THINKS AND DOES IS FROM THE LORD, AND NOT FROM HIMSELF. It has just been stated above what reformation and regeneration are, and also that man is reformed and regenerated by means of the two faculties, rationality and liberty; and since this is done by means of these faculties something further will now be said concerning them. It is from rationality that man has the power to understand, and from liberty that he has the power to will, in both cases as if from himself. Nevertheless, a man cannot from freedom will what is good and consequently do it according to reason unless he is regenerate. A wicked man is only able to will evil from freedom and to do it according to thought which by confirmation he makes to appear rational. For evil can be confirmed as easily as good; but it is confirmed by means of fallacies and appearances, and these when confirmed become falsities; and when evil has been confirmed it appears to be rational. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 87</h4><p>87. (4) By means of these two faculties man can be so far reformed and regenerated as he can be led by means of them to acknowledge that every thing good and true that he thinks and does is from the Lord, and not from himself. It has been told just above what reformation is and what regeneration is, also that man is reformed and regenerated by means of the two faculties, rationality and liberty; and since it is by means of these that this is done, something further shall be said about them. It is from rationality that man has the ability to understand, and from liberty that he has the ability to will, in both cases as if from himself. Nevertheless, none but a regenerate man has the ability to will good from freedom, and thus do it in accordance with reason. An evil man is able from freedom to will evil only, and to do evil in accordance with the thought that he makes by confirmations to appear rational. For evil can be confirmed as easily as good; although evil is confirmed by means of fallacies and appearances, which become falsities when they are confirmed; and when anything has been confirmed it appears to be in harmony with the reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 87 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>87. V. Quod homo mediis illis binis facultatibus tantum reformari et regenerari possit, quantum potest per illas adduci ad agnoscendum, quod omne verum et bonum, quod cogitat et facit, sit a Domino, et non a semet. Quid reformatio et quid regeneratio, mox supra dictum est, tum quod homo per binas illas facultates, quae sunt Rationalitas et Libertas, reformetur et regeneretur: et quia hoc per illas fit, ideo de illis adhuc aliqua dicentur. Homo ex Rationalitate habet, quod possit intelligere, et ex Libertate quod possit velle, utrumque sicut a se, at posse ex libero velle bonum, et inde secundum rationem id agere, non potest nisi regeneratus: malus solum potest ex libero velle malum, ac secundum <sup>1</sup>cogitationem, quam per confirmationes sicut rationis facit, id agere; malum enim potest aeque confirmari, sicut bonum, sed malum per fallacias et apparentias, quae dum confirmantur fiunt falsa, <sup>2</sup>et cum confirmatum est, apparet sicut rationis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 id secundum ubi in prima editione secundum<p>2 Prima editio: faisa, </p>
