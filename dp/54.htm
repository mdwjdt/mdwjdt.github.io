<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第54节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>54、有这样一种表象：无限与有限之间不可能存在结合，因为它们之间没有比率关系，并且有限不能包含无限。然而，结合是有可能的，既因为无限从它自己创造一切事物，如《圣爱与圣智》一书<a href="../dlw/282.htm">（282-284节）</a>所说明的，还因为有限事物中的无限必然关注来自它自身的无限之物，在有限存在物看来，这无限似乎能如同在它们自己里面。因此，有限与无限之间存在一种比率关系是有可能的，但这种比率关系不是来自有限，而是来自有限里面的无限。此外，有限存在物以这种方式就能包含无限之物。这意思不是说在它自己里面的有限存在物本身，而是说仿佛在它自己里面、源于它里面来自它自身的无限的有限存在物。关于这些事，下文会有更多说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 54</h4><p>54. It seems as though the infinite could not be conjoined with something finite, because there is no proportional relation between the infinite and the finite, and because the finite cannot encompass the infinite. But still a conjunction is possible, both because the infinite being created all things from itself, in conformity with points we demonstrated in the treatise <a href="../dlw/282.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 282-284</a>, and because the infinite being cannot regard anything else in finite things than something infinite from itself, which can appear in finite beings as though it were in them. Thus is a relation between the finite and infinite possible, arising not from the finite, but from the infinite in the finite. And thus also can a finite being encompass the infinite - not the finite being in itself, but as though in itself, from something infinite in it from the infinite in itself. <p>But more on this subject in the discussions that now follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 54</h4><p>54. It seems as though what is infinite cannot be united to what is finite because there is no ratio between the infinite and the finite and because the finite cannot contain the infinite. There are two reasons, though, why there can be a union. The first is that the Infinite One created everything from himself (as explained in <a href="../dlw/282.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 282-284</a>); and the second is that the Infinite One cannot focus on anything in finite beings except what is infinite from him. This can seem to finite beings as though it were within them; and this provides a ratio between what is finite and what is infinite. The ratio does not come from anything finite but from the Infinite One within it. In this way, too, the finite can contain the infinite. What does this is not the finite being in and of itself, but the finite being in its apparent autonomy, derived from the One who is intrinsically infinite. (There will be more on this subject later [<a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="64.htm">64</a>, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="219.htm">219</a>, <a href="294.htm">294</a>].) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 54</h4><p>54. There is an appearance that there can be no conjunction between the Infinite and the finite, because there can be no ratio between them, and because the finite cannot contain the Infinite. Nevertheless, conjunction is possible, both because the Infinite created all things from Himself as is shown in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM (n. <a href="../dlw/282.htm">282-284</a>), and because the Infinite in finite things cannot but regard what is infinite from Himself and this infinite can appear to finite beings as in themselves. Thus a ratio is possible between the finite and the Infinite, not from the finite but from the Infinite in the finite. Moreover, in this way the finite being is able to contain what is infinite, not indeed the finite being in himself, but as if in himself from the Infinite from itself in him. But more will be said concerning these things in what now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 54</h4><p>54. There is an appearance that the Infinite cannot be conjoined with the finite, because there is no possible ratio between them, and because the finite cannot contain what is infinite; nevertheless, such a conjunction is possible, both because the Infinite created all things from Himself (as is shown in <a href="../dlw/282.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 282-284</a>), and because the Infinite in things finite can look only to what is infinite from Himself, and with finite beings this infinite from Himself can appear as if it were in them, whereby a ratio between the finite and the infinite is provided, not from the finite, but from the infinite in the finite; and by this also the finite being becomes capable of containing what is infinite, not the finite being in himself, but as if in himself from what is infinite from itself in him. But of this more in what now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 54 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>54. Apparet sicut Infinitum non possit conjungi finito, quia non datur ratio infiniti et finiti, et quia finitum non est capax infiniti, sed usque conjunctio datur, tam quia Infinitus ex Seipso creavit omnia, secundum illa quae in Transactione <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_54/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_282">de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA 282-284</a>, demonstrata sunt, quam quia Infinitus in finitis non aliud potest spectare quam infinitum <sup>1</sup>a se, et quod hoc possit apparere apud finitos sicut in illis; sic datur ratio finiti et infiniti, non a finito, sed ab Infinito in finito; et quoque sic finitus est capax infiniti, non finitus in se, sed sicut in se, ab Infinito a se in illo. Sed de his plura in nunc sequentibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: infinitnm </p>
