<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第64节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>64、⑸圣治的核心是在形成天使天堂的过程中关注无限和永恒之物，以使它能在主眼里如同一个人，也就是祂自己的一个形像。整个天堂在主面前如同一个人，天堂的每个社群也是如此；这就是为何每位天使都是一个完整形式的人，这是因为神造物主，也就是永恒之主，正是人，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书<a href="../hh/59.htm">（59-86节）</a>。我还解释了，因此，天堂的一切和人的一切有一种对应关系<a href="../hh/87.htm">（87-102节）</a>。整个天堂如同一个人，这一点我没有看见过；因为除了主以外，没有人能看见整个天堂。但我有几次看见天堂的一整个社群，无论大小，显为一个人。那时，我被告知，最大的社群，也就是整体上的天堂，就是如此显现的，但只在主面前如此显现；这就是为何每位天使都是一个完整形式的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 64</h4><p>64. (5) To regard infinity and eternity in forming the angelic heaven, that it may be in the Lord's sight as though a single person that is an image of Him, is the inmost object of Divine providence. The fact that the whole of heaven, and likewise every society of heaven, is in the Lord's sight as though a single person, that it is because of this that every angel is in perfect form human, and that this is because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, is human, may be seen in the book <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-86</a>. It may also be seen that there is consequently a correspondence of all the constituents of heaven with all the constituents of the human being, <a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-102</a>. <p>That the whole of heaven is as though a single person is not something I have seen, because the whole of heaven cannot be seen by anyone but the Lord alone. But that an entire society of heaven, greater or smaller, has appeared as a single person is something I have seen, several times, and I have then been told that the grandest society, which is heaven in its whole complex, appears similarly, but to the Lord, and that this is the reason every angel is in complete form human. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 64</h4><p>64. 5. The very core of divine providence is its focus on what is infinite and eternal in the forming of the angelic heaven so that it can be a single person in the Lord's sight, a person who is his image. I explained in <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-86</a> that heaven as a whole is like a single person in the Lord's sight, that the same holds true for each community of heaven, that this is why every angel is a perfectly formed person, and that this is because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, is a person. I also explained that there is therefore a correspondence of everything in heaven with everything in the human being (<a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-102</a>). I myself have not seen that the whole heaven is like a single person, because no one can see the whole heaven but the Lord alone. However, I have at times seen that entire communities of heaven, large and small, have looked like a single individual. I have been told at such times that the largest community, heaven in its entirety, looks the same, but only in the Lord's sight, and that this is why every angel is a person in complete form. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 64</h4><p>64. V. THE INMOST OF THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE IS TO REGARD WHAT IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL IN FORMING THE ANGELIC HEAVEN, IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE BEFORE THE LORD AS ONE MAN, THE IMAGE OF HIMSELF. It may be seen in the work HEAVEN AND HELL (n. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-86</a>) that the universal heaven is as one man before the Lord, and likewise every society in heaven; and that consequently every angel is a man in perfect form, and this because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, is Man; also that there is thus a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man (n. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>). That the universal heaven is as one man has not been seen by me, because the universal heaven cannot be seen by anyone but the Lord alone; but that an entire society of heaven, greater or smaller, appeared as one man, has several times been seen by me; and it was then said that the greatest society, which is heaven in its entire aggregate, so appears, but only before the Lord, and that this is the reason why every angel is in complete form a man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 64</h4><p>64. (5) Looking to what is infinite and eternal in the formation of the angelic heaven, that it may be before the Lord as one man, which is an image of Himself, is the inmost of the Divine providence. That the entire heaven is as one man before the Lord and likewise each society of heaven, and that it is from this that each angel is a man in complete form, and this because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, is Man, may be seen in the work <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-86</a>; also, that in consequence there is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man (<a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>). That the entire heaven is as one man has not been seen by me; since the entire heaven can be seen by no one except the Lord; but that an entire society of heaven, greater or smaller, appears as one man, has several times been seen by me; and it was then said that the greatest society, which is heaven in its entire aggregate, so appears, but only before the Lord; and that this is the reason why every angel is in complete form a man. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 64 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>64. V. Quod spectare Infinitum et Aeternum in <sup>1</sup>formando Coelum angelicum, ut sit coram Domino ut unus Homo, qui Imago Ipsius, sit intimum Divinae Providentiae. Quod universum Coelum sit sicut unus Homo coram Domino, et quod omnis Societas coeli similiter, et quod inde sit quod unusquisque angelus sit in perfecta forma homo, et quod hoc sit quia <sup>2</sup>Deus Creator, qui est Dominus ab aeterno, est Homo, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_64/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59">de COELO ET INFERNO 59-86</a>.
