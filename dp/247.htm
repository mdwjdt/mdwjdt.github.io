<h4 align="center"></h4><p>247、⑦最后，以色列民族被允许将主钉死在十字架上。这是因为该民族的教会彻底毁灭了，并且毁得如此彻底，以致他们不但不认识并承认主，甚至还仇恨祂；然而，他们对主所做的一切都符合主圣治的律法。十字架受难是最后的试探或争战，主由此完全战胜了地狱，完全荣耀了祂的人身，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》<a href="../lord/12.htm">（12-14节）</a>和《新耶路撒冷教义之信篇》<a href="../faith/34.htm">（34-35节）</a>。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 247</h4><p>247. (7) That that nation was permitted to crucify the Lord: This was permitted because the church with that nation was utterly ruined and became such that the people not only failed to recognize and acknowledge the Lord, but in fact hated Him. But still, all that they did to Him accorded with the laws of His Divine providence. <p>(That the suffering of the cross was the last temptation or trial, or final combat, by which the Lord fully overcame the hells and fully glorified His humanity, may be seen in <a href="../lord/12.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 12-14</a>, and <a href="../faith/34.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding Faith 34-35</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 247</h4><p>247. 7. That nation was allowed to crucify the Lord. This was because the church in that nation was in ruins, so much so that it not only did not recognize and believe in the Lord but actually felt hatred toward him. Still, everything they did to him was under the laws of his own divine providence. On the passion of the cross as the last temptation or the last battle, by which the Lord completely defeated the hells and completely transformed his human nature, see <a href="../lord/12.htm">Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord 12-14</a> and <a href="../faith/34.htm">Teachings for the New Jerusalem on Faith 34-35</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 247</h4><p>247. 7. That nation was permitted to crucify the Lord. This was because the Church with that nation was wholly vastated and became such that not only did they not know and acknowledge the Lord, but they even hated Him; and yet all that they did to Him was according to the laws of His Divine Providence. The passion of the cross was the last temptation or the final combat by which the Lord fully conquered the hells and fully glorified His Human. This may be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD (n. <a href="../lord/12.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 12-14</a>); and in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING FAITH (n. <a href="../faith/34.htm">34-35</a>). </p>

Quod Genti isti fuerit permissum crucifigere Dominum, erat quia Ecclesia apud illam Gentem prorsus devastata fuit, et talis facta, ut non modo non cognoscerent et agnoscerent Dominum, sed etiam odio haberent Ipsum: at usque omnia quae fecerunt Ipsi, fuerunt secundum leges Divinae Ipsius Providentiae.
