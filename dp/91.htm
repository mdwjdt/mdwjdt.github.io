<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第91节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>91、但很少有人能清楚明白，使一个人得以改造和重生的，就是对主的承认，以及对一切良善和真理皆来自主的一种承认。也就是说，人们可能会想，既然主是全能，又愿意拯救所有人，那么这种承认有什么用呢？只要动动恻隐之心，难道祂就不能并愿意这样做吗？但这种想法并非来自主，也不是来自理解力的任何内在视觉，也就是来自任何光照或启示。因此，有必要简单说一说这种承认会产生什么效果。<p>在灵界，空间无非是表象，智慧带来同在，爱带来结合；反之亦然。对主的承认可能来自智慧，也可能来自爱。来自智慧的对主的承认就其本身而言，无非是知识，它来源于教义；来自爱的对主的承认来源于遵行教义的一种生活。后者产生结合，而前者产生同在。原因在于，那些弃绝关于主的教义之人离开主；而那些弃绝生活，没有弃绝教义的人是同在的，尽管是分离的。他们就像互相交谈，但对彼此没有爱的朋友。或就像这样的两个人，其中一个向另一个如向朋友那样说话，却恨他如同仇敌。<p>事实的确如此，这从以下共识清楚可知：教导得好，生活良善的人会得救，而教导得好，生活邪恶的人不会得救；还有，不承认神的人不能得救。这一切清楚表明，仅仅出于所谓的信思想主，却不出于仁做任何事的这种宗教是何性质。所以主说：<p>你们为什么称呼我主啊，主啊，却不遵我的话行呢？凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，就像一个人盖房子，把根基安在磐石上。惟有听见不去行的，就像一个人在土地上盖房子，没有根基。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">（路加福音6:46-49）</a></p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 91</h4><p>91. The fact that an acknowledgment of the Lord, and an acknowledgment that every good and truth originates from Him, are what make it possible for a person to be reformed and regenerated is something that few people can see intellectually. For the thought may occur, "What does that acknowledgment do, when the Lord is omnipotent and wills the salvation of all, and so has the ability and will to accomplish it, if only He is moved to mercy?" <p>But thinking in this way does not come from the Lord, and so neither does it issue from an interior sight of the intellect, that is to say, from any state of enlightenment. Therefore we must say briefly here what the acknowledgment accomplishes.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world, where intervals of space are merely appearances, wisdom brings about presence and love brings about conjunction; and vice versa. <p>Possible is an acknowledgment of the Lord occasioned by wisdom, and an acknowledgment of the Lord occasioned by love. An acknowledgment of the Lord occasioned by wisdom, which regarded in itself is simply a recognition, occurs as a result of doctrine, and an acknowledgment of the Lord occasioned by love occurs as a result of a life in accordance with that doctrine. The first brings about the Lord's presence, but the latter conjunction. <p>It is because of this that people who reject any doctrine regarding the Lord remove themselves from His presence; and because they also reject an accordant life, they separate themselves from Him. On the other hand, those who do not reject the doctrine, but only an accordant life, are in His presence, but still separated. They are like friends who converse together, but do not love each other. Or they are like two people, one of whom speaks with the other as a friend, but hates him as an enemy.</p><p>[3] The reality of this is also something people know from the common recognition that one who teaches rightly and lives rightly is saved, but not one who teaches rightly and lives evilly; and that one who does not acknowledge God cannot be saved. <p>It is apparent from this what kind of religion it is to think about the Lord in conformity with faith, as it is termed, and not to do anything out of charity. Therefore the Lord says: <p>Why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do the things which I say? Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them ... is like a man building a house, who... laid the foundation on the rock... But he who hears and does not do is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 91</h4><p>91. The fact is that recognition of the Lord and recognition that everything good and true comes from him are what make our reformation and regeneration possible; but not many people can see this intelligently. That is, people can wonder, "What is the use of this recognition, when the Lord is omnipotent and wants to save everyone? Surely, then, he can and he wants to, provided only that he is moved to pity." <p>This kind of thinking does not come from the Lord, though, so it is not based on any deeper intellectual sight, that is, on any enlightenment. I need therefore to say briefly what that acknowledgment accomplishes.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world, where space is only apparent, wisdom causes presence and love causes union, and the reverse. There is an acknowledgment of the Lord from wisdom and there is an acknowledgment of the Lord from love. Acknowledgment of the Lord from wisdom, which in its own right is only a kind of knowing, comes from a belief system. Acknowledgment of the Lord from love comes from living by what that belief system teaches. This latter brings about union, the other brings about presence. This is why people who reject beliefs about the Lord move away from him; and if they also reject the life, they cut themselves off from him. If they reject only the life but not the beliefs, they are present but still cut off. They are like acquaintances who talk with each other but have no love for each other, or like two people when one talks cordially with the other but is still an enemy, full of hatred.</p><p>[3] The truth of this is recognized in the widely accepted notion that people who teach the truth and live well are saved but not people who teach the truth and live evil lives, as well as in the notion that people who do not acknowledge God cannot be saved. We can see from this what kind of religion is involved in thinking about God from what we call faith but not doing anything out of caring. This is why the Lord said, <p>Why do you call me "Lord, Lord," and do not do what I say? Whoever comes to me and hears my words and does them I will compare to someone who built a house and laid its foundation on a rock; but whoever hears my words and does not do them is like someone who builds a house on the ground without any foundation. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 91</h4><p>91. However, very few can apprehend with the understanding that the acknowledgment of the Lord, and the acknowledgment that all that is good and true is from Him, are what cause a man to be reformed and regenerated. For it may be thought, What does that acknowledgment do, since the Lord is Omnipotent and wills the salvation of all, and consequently that He is able and willing to effect it, if only He is moved to mercy? But such thought is not from the Lord, nor is it from the interior sight of the understanding, that is, from any enlightenment; therefore it will be briefly stated here what is effected by acknowledgment.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world where spaces are nothing but appearances, wisdom causes presence and love causes conjunction, each acting in turn. There is an acknowledgment of the Lord from wisdom, and there is an acknowledgment of the Lord from love. Acknowledgment of the Lord from wisdom, which regarded in itself is merely a matter of knowledge, results from doctrine; while acknowledgment of the Lord from love results from a life according to doctrine. This causes conjunction, but the other causes presence. The reason is that those who reject doctrine concerning the Lord remove themselves from Him; while those who reject life but not doctrine are present, yet separated. They are like friends who converse together, but who have no love for one another; and they are like two persons, one of whom speaks to the other as a friend but hates him as an enemy.</p><p>[3] That this is so is well known from the common idea that he who teaches well and lives well is saved, but not he who teaches well and lives wickedly; and also that he who does not acknowledge God cannot be saved. From these considerations it is clear what the nature of that religion is that merely thinks about the Lord from faith, as it is called, but does not do anything from charity. Therefore the Lord says:<p>Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them ... is like a man which built an house ... and laid the foundation on a rock. ... But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 91</h4><p>91. But very few are able to apprehend intelligently that acknowledgment of the Lord, and an acknowledgment that all that is good and true is from the Lord, are what cause a man to be reformed and regenerated. For it may be thought, What does that acknowledgment do, since the Lord is omnipotent and wills to save all? And therefore is He not able and willing to do this, provided He is moved to mercy? But such thought is not from the Lord; nor is it from any interior sight of the understanding, that is, from any enlightenment. Therefore what this acknowledgment effects shall be briefly stated.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world, where spaces are nothing but appearances, presence is caused by wisdom and conjunction by love; and vice versa. There can be an acknowledgment of the Lord from wisdom, and there can be an acknowledgment of the Lord from love. Acknowledgment of the Lord from wisdom, which regarded in itself is nothing but knowledge, is effected by doctrine; while acknowledgment of the Lord from love is effected by a life in accordance with doctrine. This produces conjunction, but the other presence. And for this reason those that reject doctrine concerning the Lord remove themselves from Him; and as such also reject life, they separate themselves from Him; while those that reject life and not doctrine are present, although separated. They are like friends who talk with one another, but have no love for one another. Or they are like two persons, one of whom speaks to the other as a friend, and yet hates him as an enemy.</p><p> [3] That this is true is acknowledged in the common belief that he who teaches well and lives well is saved, but he who teaches well and lives wickedly is not saved; also that he who does not acknowledge God cannot be saved. All this makes clear what that religion is that merely thinks about the Lord from faith, as it is called, but does not do anything from charity. So the Lord says:- <p>Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say? Every one that cometh to Me and heareth My sayings and doeth them, is like a man building a house and laid a foundation upon the rock. But he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>). </p>

Quod autem agnitio Domini, et quod agnitio quod omne bonum et verum sit ab Ipso, faciat ut homo reformetur et regeneretur, est quod pauci possunt intellectu videre, nam potest cogitari, quid facit agnitio illa, cum Dominus Omnipotens est, et vult omnium salutem, et inde quod possit et velit, modo ad misericordiam moveatur: sed ita <sup>1</sup>cogitare, non est ex Domino, ita nec est ex interiori visu intellectus, hoc est, ex aliqua illustratione; quare quid agnitio <sup>2</sup>operatur, hic paucis dicetur.</p><p>[2] In Mundo spirituali, ubi spatia sunt modo apparentiae, sapientia facit praesentiam, et amor facit conjunctionem; et vicissim: datur agnitio Domini ex sapientia, et datur agnitio Domini ex amore; agnitio Domini ex sapientia, quae in se spectata est solum cognitio, datur ex doctrina, et agnitio Domini ex amore datur ex vita secundum illam; haec dat conjunctionem, illa autem praesentiam: quae causa est, quod qui rejiciunt doctrinam de Domino, se removeant ab Ipso; et quia illi etiam <sup>3</sup>rejiciunt vitam, se separent ab Ipso: at qui non rejiciunt doctrinam, sed vitam, illi praesentes sunt, sed usque separati: sunt sicut amici, qui colloquuntur inter se, sed non mutuo amant se; et sunt sicut duo, quorum unus tanquam amicus loquitur cum altero, <sup>4</sup>sed tanquam inimicus odit illum.</p><p>[3] Quod ita sit, etiam a communi idea notum est, quod qui bene docet et bene vivit, salvetur, non autem qui bene docet et male vivit; tum quod qui non agnoscit Deum, non salvari possit. Ex his patet, qualis religio est, cogitare de Domino ex fide, ut vocatur, et non facere aliquid ex charitate; quare dicit Dominus, "Quid Me vocatis Domine, Domine, et non facitis quae dico: omnis qui venit ad Me, et audit sermones meos, et facit illos, similis est homini aedificanti domum, et posuit fundamentum super petra: qui vero audit et non facit, similis est homini aedificanti domum super humo sine fundamento," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_91/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_6_46-49">Lucas 6:46-49</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: ita<p>2 Prima editio: agnitio<p>3 Prima editio: etiam<p>4 Prima editio: alteto, </p>
