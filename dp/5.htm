<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第5节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>5、⑶一切受造物里面都有这一体的某种形像。从《圣爱与圣智》各处的说明，尤其从47-51，55-60，282-284，290-295，313-318，319-326，349-357节可以明显看出，一切受造物里面都有在主里面为一体且作为一体从祂发出的神性之爱与神性智慧的某种形像。我在这些章节解释了神性存在于一切受造物中，因为神造物主，就是永恒之主，从祂自己产生了灵界太阳，并通过这太阳产生了宇宙万物。因此，来自主且主在其中的这太阳，不仅是最初的物质，还是构成一切事物的唯一物质。由于它是唯一的物质，故可推知，这物质就存在于一切受造物中，但照着各自的功用而具有无限多样性。<p>既然神性之爱与神性智慧在主里面，神性之火与神性光辉在来自祂的太阳里面，既然属灵之热与属灵之光来自那太阳，并且两者构成一体，那么可推知，这一体的某种形像就存在于一切受造物中。这就是为何宇宙万物都与良善和真理有关，事实上与它们的结合有关；或也可说，宇宙万物都与爱和智慧及其结合有关，因为良善属于爱，真理属于智慧。事实上，爱将属于它的一切都称为良善，智慧将属于它的一切都称为真理。在下文我们会看到，这种结合存在于一切受造物中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 5</h4><p>5. (3) Some image of this union exists in every created thing. Divine love and wisdom, which in the Lord are united, and which emanate from Him as one, are present in some image of them in every created thing; and this can be seen from points we demonstrated here and there in our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, and especially from the discussions found there in <a href="../dlw/47.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 47-51</a>, <a href="../dlw/55.htm">55-60</a>, <a href="../dlw/282.htm">282-284</a>, <a href="../dlw/290.htm">290-295</a>, <a href="../dlw/313.htm">313-318</a>, <a href="../dlw/319.htm">319-326</a>, <a href="../dlw/349.htm">349-357</a>. In those places we showed that the Divine exists in every created thing, because God the Creator - who is the Lord from eternity - produced from Himself the sun of the spiritual world, and by means of that sun all the constituents of the universe. Consequently that sun which originates from the Lord and in which the Lord is, is not only the first substance, but also the one and only substance from which springs everything else. Moreover, because it is the one and only substance, it follows that it exists in all created things, but with infinite variety in accordance with the uses they serve.</p><p>[2] Now because in the Lord are Divine love and wisdom, and in the sun originating from Him Divine fire and resplendence, and radiating from the sun spiritual heat and light, and because these two are united, it follows that some image of this union exists in every created thing. <p>So it is that everything in the universe has some relation to goodness and truth, indeed to a union of them; or to say the same thing, everything in the universe has some relation to love and wisdom and to a union of them. For goodness is connected with love, and truth with wisdom, as love calls everything pertaining to it good, and wisdom calls everything pertaining to it truth. <p>In subsequent discussions we will see that a union of these exists in every created thing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 5</h4><p>5. 3. There is some image of this unity in everything that has been created. We can tell from what is presented throughout Divine Love and Wisdom that in everything created there is some image of the divine love and wisdom that are a whole in the Lord and that emanate from him as a whole. See especially <a href="../dlw/47.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 47-51</a>, <a href="54.htm">54-60</a> [<a href="../dlw/55.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 55-60</a>], <a href="../dlw/282.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 282-284</a>, <a href="../dlw/290.htm">290-295</a>, <a href="316.htm">316-318</a> [<a href="../dlw/313.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 313-318</a>], <a href="../dlw/319.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 319-326</a>, <a href="../dlw/349.htm">349-357</a>. I have explained in these passages that Divinity is present in everything that has been created because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, brought forth the sun of the spiritual world from his actual self, and by means of that sun brought forth the whole universe. This means that that sun, which is from the Lord and is where the Lord is, is not only the first but the only substance of which everything is made. Since it is the only substance, it follows that it is present in everything that has been created, but with infinite variety depending on function.</p><p>[2] In the Lord, then, there is divine love and wisdom; in the sun that comes from him there is divine fire and divine radiance; and from that sun come spiritual warmth and spiritual light, with the two making a single whole. It follows, then, that some image of this whole is present in everything that has been created. <p>This is why everything in the universe is based on what is good and what is true and in fact on their union, or (which amounts to the same thing) everything in the universe is based on love and wisdom and on their union, since goodness is a matter of love and truth is a matter of wisdom. Love in fact calls everything of its own good, and wisdom calls everything of its own true. <p>We will see now that this union is present in everything that has been created. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 5</h4><p>5. III. THIS ONE IS IN A CERTAIN MANNER IMAGED IN EVERY CREATED THING. From what has been shown throughout the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, and especially in n. <a href="../dlw/47.htm">47-51</a>, <a href="../dlw/55.htm">55-60</a>, <a href="../dlw/282.htm">282-284</a>, <a href="../dlw/290.htm">290-295</a>, <a href="../dlw/313.htm">313-318</a>, <a href="../dlw/319.htm">319-326</a>, <a href="../dlw/349.htm">349-357</a>, it may appear that the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, which are one in the Lord, and which proceed from Him as one, are in a certain manner imaged in every created thing. In these numbers it is shown that the Divine is in every created thing, because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, produced from Himself the Sun of the spiritual world, and through that Sun all things in the universe; consequently, that that Sun, which is from the Lord and in which the Lord is, is not only the first substance but is also the one Only substance from which all things are; and because it is the one only substance it follows that this substance is in every created thing, but with infinite variety according to the uses of each.</p><p>[2] Now since Divine Love and Divine Wisdom are in the Lord, and since Divine fire and Divine brightness are in that Sun from Him, and since spiritual heat and spiritual light are from that Sun and these two make one, it follows that this one is in a certain manner imaged in every created thing. Hence it is that all things in the universe have relation to good and truth, and indeed to their union; or what is the same, that all things in the universe have relation to love and wisdom and to their union; for good is of love and truth is of wisdom; for love calls all that pertains to it good, and wisdom calls all that pertains to it truth. That there is a union of these in every created thing will be seen in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 5</h4><p>5. (3) In a certain image this one is in every created thing. That the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, which are a one in the Lord and go forth from Him as a one, are in every created thing in a certain image can be seen from what is shown throughout the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, and especially from what is said in <a href="../dlw/47.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 47-51</a>, <a href="../dlw/55.htm">55-60</a>, <a href="../dlw/282.htm">282-284</a>, <a href="../dlw/290.htm">290-295</a>, <a href="../dlw/313.htm">313-318</a>, <a href="../dlw/319.htm">319-326</a>, <a href="../dlw/349.htm">349-357</a>, where it is shown that the Divine is in every created thing, because God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, produced from Himself the sun of the spiritual world, and through that sun all things of the universe, consequently that that sun, which is from the Lord, and in which the Lord is, is not only the first substance but is also the only substance from which all things are; and since this is the only substance, it follows that it is in every created thing, but with infinite variety according to uses.</p><p>[2] Now since Divine love and Divine wisdom are in the Lord, and since Divine fire and brightness are in that sun from Him, and spiritual heat and spiritual light are from that sun, and these two make a one, it follows that in a certain image this one is in every created thing. Because of this all things in the universe have relation to good and truth, and, in fact, to their conjunction, or what is the same, all things in the universe have relation to love and wisdom and to their conjunction, since good belongs to love and truth to wisdom; for love calls all that pertains to it good, and wisdom calls all that pertains to it truth. That there is a conjunction of these in every created thing will be seen in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 5 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>5. III. Quod hoc unum sit in quadam imagine in omni creato. Quod Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, quae in Domino unum sunt, ac ut unum procedunt ab Ipso, sint in quadam imagine in omni creato, constare potest ex illis quae in Transactione de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA passim demonstrata sunt, et imprimis ex illis quae ibi <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_47">de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA 47-51</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_55">55-60</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_282">282-284</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_290">290-295</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_313">313-326</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_5/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_349">349-357</a>; <sup>1</sup>in quibus locis ostensum est, quod Divinum sit in omni creato, quia Deus Creator, qui est Dominus ab aeterno, a Se Ipso produxerat Solem Mundi Spiritualis, et per illum Solem omnia Universi, consequenter quod ille Sol qui a Domino et ubi est Dominus, sit non modo prima substantia, sed etiam unica ex qua omnia; et quia est unica substantia, sequitur quod in omni creato sit illa, sed cum infinita varietate secundum usus.</p><p>[2] Nunc quia in Domino est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, et in Sole ab Ipso Divinus ignis et Divinus splendor, et a Sole spiritualis calor et spiritualis lux, et haec duo unum faciunt, sequitur quod hoc unum in quadam imagine in omni creato sit. Inde est, quod omnia, quae in universo sunt, se referant ad Bonum et Verum, imo ad conjunctionem illorum, seu quod idem est, quod omnia in Universo se referant ad Amorem et Sapientiam, et ad conjunctionem illorum, nam bonum est amoris et verum est sapientiae, amor enim omne suum vocat bonum, et sapientia omne suum vocat verum: quod horum conjunctio sit in omni creato, videbitur in sequentibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio habet "54" in loco "55" et "316" in loco "313" et "457" in loco "357." </p>
