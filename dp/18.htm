<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第18节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>18、死后，每个人都必须要么处于良善，同时处于真理，要么处于邪恶，同时处于虚假，因为良善与邪恶不可能结合；良善与邪恶的虚假也不可能结合，邪恶与良善的真理同样不可能结合。事实上，这些都是对立物，对立物会彼此争战，直到一方毁灭另一方。在启示录，主对老底嘉教会所说的话，就是指那些处于邪恶，同时处于良善的人：<p>我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">（启示录3:15，16）</a> <p>还有：<p>一个人不能事奉两个主。不是恶这个爱那个，就是依附这个轻视那个。你们不能又事奉神，又事奉玛门（玛门是财利的意思）。<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">（马太福音6:24）</a></p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 18</h4><p>18. Everyone after death must be impelled either by good and at the same time by truth, or by evil and at the same time by falsity, and this because good and evil cannot be conjoined, or good and at the same time the falsity of evil, or evil and at the same time the truth of good. For they are opposites, and opposites war with each other until one destroys the other. <p>People who are impelled by evil and at the same time by good are meant in the book of Revelation by these words of the Lord to the church of the Laodiceans: <p>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would you were cold or hot. (But) because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>) <p>Also by these words of the Lord: <p>No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and disregard the other. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 18</h4><p>18. The reason everyone must be engaged in what is good and what is true together after death or in what is evil and what is false is that good and evil cannot be united. Neither can good and any falsity that is prompted by evil, or evil and any truth that is prompted by anything good. Such things are opposites, and opposites battle with each other until one destroys the other. <p>It is people who are engaged in evil and good at the same time that are referred to in these words of the Lord to the church in Laodicea in the Book of Revelation: <p>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot. However, since you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>), <p>and by these words of the Lord: <p>No one can serve two masters. You will either hate one and love the other or cling to one and ignore the other. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 18</h4><p>18. After death everyone must be either in good and at the same time in truth, or in evil and at the same time in falsity, because good and evil cannot be united; nor can good and at the same time the falsity of evil be united, nor evil and at the same time the truth of good; for these are opposites, and opposites fight each other until one destroys the other. Those who are in evil and at the same time in good are meant by these words of the Lord to the Church of the Laodiceans in the Apocalypse:<p>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<p>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Rev. 3:15-16</a>.<p>and also by these words of the Lord:<p>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 18</h4><p>18. After death every one must be in good and also in truth, or must be in evil and also in falsity, for the reason that good cannot be conjoined with evil, nor can good be conjoined with the falsity of evil, nor evil with the truth of good; for these are opposites, and opposites fight each other until one destroys the other. Those who are in evil and also in good are meant by these words of the Lord to the church of the Laodiceans in the Apocalypse:<p>"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; would that thou wert cold or hot. So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My mouth." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Apocalypse 3:15-16</a>); <p>and also by these words of the Lord:- <p>No man can serve two masters; for he will either hate the one and love the other, or he will cling to the one and neglect the other (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 18 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>18. Quod unusquisque post mortem vel erit in bono et simul vero, vel in malo et simul falso, est quia bonum et malum non conjungi possunt, nec bonum et simul falsum mali, nec malum et simul verum boni, sunt enim opposita, ac opposita inter se pugnant, usque ut unum destruat alterum. Illi qui in malo et simul bono sunt, intelliguntur per haec Domini ad Ecclesiam Laodicensium in Apocalypsi, "Novi opera tua, quod neque frigidus sis, neque fervidus; utinam frigidus esses vel fervidus: sed quia tepidus es, et neque frigidus neque fervidus, exspuiturus sum te ex ore meo," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_18/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_15-16">Apocalypsis 3:15-16</a>: tum per haec Domini, "Nemo potest duobus dominis servire, nam vel unum odio habebit et alterum amabit, aut uni adhaerebit, et alterum negliget," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_18/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_6_24">Matthaeus 6:24</a>. </p>
