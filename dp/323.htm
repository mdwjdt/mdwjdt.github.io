<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第323节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>323、⑴创世的目的是一个来自人类的天堂。天堂唯独由那些生而为人的人组成，这在1758年伦敦出版的《天堂与地狱》一书和本书前文（27节）已经说明；由于天堂唯独由这些人组成，故可推知，创世的目的是一个来自人类的天堂。我在前面<a href="27.htm">（27-45节）</a>解释了，这就是创世的目的；不过，这一点通过对下列要点的解释会变得更清楚：<p>①每个人被造都是为了活到永远。<p>②每个人被造都是为了在幸福的状态下活到永远。<p>③这意味着每个人被造都是为了进入天堂。<p>④神性之爱必意愿这一切，神性智慧必为此作准备。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 323</h4><p>323. (1) The end in creation is a heaven from the human race. In the book Heaven and Hell, published in London in 1758, and also in discussions above, we have shown that heaven consists of no others than people who have been born people; and because heaven consists of no others, it follows that the end in creation is a heaven from the human race. <p>That this was the end in creation is something that we have, indeed, demonstrated in nos. <a href="27.htm">27-45</a> above, but it will be seen still more clearly from an explanation of the following points: <p>1. Every person has been created to live to eternity. <p>2. Every person has been created to live to eternity in a blessed state. <p>3. Every person has thus been created to enter into heaven. <p>4. Divine love cannot but will it, and Divine wisdom cannot but provide for it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 323</h4><p>323. 1. The ultimate purpose of creation is a heaven from the human race. I have explained in Heaven and Hell (published in London in 1758) and earlier in the present work [<a href="27.htm">27</a>] that heaven is made up solely of individuals who have been born as people on earth; and since these are the only inhabitants of heaven, it follows that the ultimate purpose of creation is a heaven from the human race. <p>I explained in <a href="27.htm">27-45</a> above that this is the purpose of creation, but this will become even clearer from the following details. (a) Everyone is created to live forever. (b) Everyone is created to live forever in a blessed state. (c) This means that everyone is created to go to heaven. (d) Divine love cannot do otherwise than intend this and divine wisdom cannot do otherwise than provide for this. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 323</h4><p>323. I. THE END OF CREATION IS A HEAVEN FROM THE HUMAN RACE. That heaven consists solely of those who have been born men is shown in the work HEAVEN AND HELL, published in London in the year 1758, and also above; and as heaven consists of no others it follows that the end of creation is a heaven from the human race. That this was the end of creation was indeed shown above (n. <a href="27.htm">27-45</a>); but it will be seen still more clearly from an explanation of the following points:<p>1. Every man is created that he may live for ever.<p>2. Every man is created that he may live for ever in a state of happiness.<p>3. Thus every man is created that he may enter heaven.<p>4. The Divine Love cannot do otherwise than desire this, and the Divine Wisdom cannot do otherwise than provide for it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 323</h4><p>323. (1) The end of creation is a heaven from the human race. That heaven consists of none but those that were born men is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell (published at London in the year 1758), and also above; and as heaven consists of no others it follows that the end of creation is a heaven from the human race. That this was the end of creation has been shown previously (<a href="27.htm">27-45</a>); but it will be made still clearer by an explanation of these points: <p>(1) Every man was created to live to eternity. <p>(2) Every man was created to live to eternity in a state of blessedness. <p>(3) Thus every man was created to come into heaven. <p>(4) The Divine love must needs will this; and the Divine wisdom must needs provide for it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 323 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>323. I. Quod finis creationis sit coelum ex Humano Genere. Quod Coelum non ex aliis consistat, quam qui nati sint homines, in Opere de COELO ET INFERNO, Londini an. 1758 edito, et quoque supra, ostensum est, et quia Coelum non ex aliis consistit, sequitur quod finis creationis sit Coelum ex Humano Genere. Quod ille Creationis finis fuerit, quidem supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_323/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_27">27-45</a>, demonstratum est; sed idem adhuc manifestius videbitur ex his explicatis. 1. Quod omnis homo creatus sit ut vivat in aeternum. 2. Quod omnis homo creatus sit ut vivat in aeternum in statu beato. 3. Quod sic omnis homo creatus sit ut in coelum veniat. 4. Quod Divinus Amor non possit aliter quam id velle, et quod Divina Sapientia non possit aliter quam id providere. </p>
