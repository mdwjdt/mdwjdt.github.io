<h4 align="center"></h4><p>13、我有时会说，爱构成人的生命；但这并不意味着在原因里面，爱与智慧分离，或良善与真理分离；因为如此分离的爱，或如此分离的良善，不是真实事物。因此，构成人的至内在生命，就是来自主的生命的爱，是在一起的爱与智慧。此外，就接受者而言，构成人生命的爱，不是在原因而是在结果里面分离的。因为爱离开它的品质是无法理解的，其品质就是智慧。这种品质或智慧只能来自它的存在，也就是爱；这就是为何爱与智慧是一体。良善与真理也一样。由于真理来自良善，如同智慧来自爱，故合在一起的两者被称为爱或良善。在其形式中的爱实际上是智慧，在其形式中的良善实际上是真理，形式是品质的源头，且是唯一源头。由此明显可知，良善若不与其真理结合，根本不是实际的良善；真理若不与其良善结合，根本不是实际的真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 13</h4><p>13. We have several times said that love constitutes a person's life, but we do not mean love divorced from wisdom or good divorced from truth in the cause, because love by itself or good by itself is not something real. The love which constitutes the inmost life that a person has from the Lord is therefore love and wisdom together. Moreover, the love which forms a person's life to the extent that he is receptive of it is also not love by itself in the cause, but in the effect. For love has no meaning apart from its distinguishing character, and its distinguishing character is wisdom. Nor can its distinguishing character or wisdom exist except from its being, which is love. Therefore the two are united, and so likewise good and truth. <p>Now because truth exists from good, as wisdom exists from love, therefore we call the two taken together love or good; for love in its expression is wisdom, and good in its expression is truth. It is from its expression and nothing else that it has all its character. <p>It can now be seen from this that goodness is good only to the extent that it is united with its truth, and that truth is true only to the extent that it is united with its goodness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 13</h4><p>13. I have stated on occasion that love is what constitutes our life, but this does not mean love separated from wisdom, or what is good separated from what is true in the cause. This is because love by itself, or what is good by itself, is nothing. Consequently, the love that constitutes our deepest life, the life that comes from the Lord, is love and wisdom together. So too, the love that constitutes our life to the extent that we are open to it is not love by itself in the cause, though it is by itself in the result. Love is incomprehensible apart from its quality, and its quality is wisdom. That quality or wisdom can come only from its underlying reality, which is love. This is why they are a single whole; and the same holds true for what is good and what is true. <p>Now since what is true comes from what is good the way wisdom comes from love, both together are called love or good. Love in its form actually is wisdom, and what is good in its form is true. Form is the one and only source of quality. <p>We can therefore conclude that what is good is actually good only to the extent that it is united to what is appropriately true, and that what is true is actually true only to the extent that it is united to what is appropriately good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 13</h4><p>13. It has sometimes been said that love makes the life of man; but this does not mean love separate from wisdom, or good separate from truth, in the cause; for love thus separate, or good thus separate, has no reality. Therefore the love which makes the inmost life of man, the life that is from the Lord, is love and wisdom together. Moreover, the love which makes the life of man regarded as a recipient, is not love separate in the cause, but in the effect. For love can be understood only from its quality, and its quality is wisdom; and its quality or wisdom can exist only from its being (esse), which is love; hence it is that love and wisdom are one. It is the same with good and truth. Now since truth is from good, as wisdom is from love, the two taken together are called love or good; for love in its form is wisdom, and good in its form is truth, and form is the source and the only source of quality. From these considerations it may be evident that good is not in the least good except in so far as it has been united to its truth, and that truth is not in the least truth except in so far as it has been united to its good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 13</h4><p>13. It has often been said that love makes the life of man; but this does not mean love separate from wisdom or good separate from truth in the cause, since love separate, or good separate is not any thing; therefore the love that makes man's inmost life, the life that is from the Lord, is love and wisdom together; and the love that makes the life of man as being a recipient is also love, not separate in the cause, but only in the effect. For love can be understood only from its quality, and its quality is wisdom; and its quality or wisdom can exist only from its being (esse) which is love, and it is from this that they are one. It is the same with good and truth. Since, then, truth is from good, as wisdom is from love, the two taken together are called love or good; for love in its form is wisdom, and good in its form is truth, and form is the source and the only source of quality. From all this it is now evident that good is not in the least good except so far as it has become joined with its truth, and that truth is not in the least truth except so far as it has become one with its good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 13 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>13. Aliquoties dictum est, quod amor faciat vitam hominis, sed non intelligitur amor separatus a sapientia, seu bonum a vero in causa, quia amor separatus seu bonum separatum, non est aliquid; quare amor qui facit vitam hominis intimam, quae est a Domino, <sup>1</sup>est amor et sapientia simul; etiam amor qui facit vitam hominis quatenus est recipiens, nec est amor separatus in causa sed in effectu; non enim potest amor intelligi absque suo quali, et quale ejus est sapientia; non potest quale seu sapientia dari quam ex suo Esse, quod est amor; inde est quod unum sint; similiter bonum et verum. Nunc quia verum est ex bono, sicut sapientia est ex amore, ideo utrumque simul sumtum vocatur amor seu bonum, est enim amor in sua forma sapientia, et est bonum in sua forma verum; ex forma et [non] aliunde est omne quale. Ex his nunc constare potest, quod bonum ne hilum plus bonum sit, quam quantum est unitum suo vero, et quod verum ne hilum plus verum sit quam quantum unitum est suo bono.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: Domiuo, </p>
