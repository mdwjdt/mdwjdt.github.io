<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第68节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>68、如前所述，天堂被划分为跟一个人里面的器官、内脏和肢体一样多的总体社群，并且这些的组成部分都只能在自己的地方。因此，由于天使是神性天堂人的组成部分，并且除了那些曾作为人在世上生活过的人外，没有人会变成天使，所以可推知，允许自己被引入天堂的人为了自己的地方不断被主预备；这一切是通过对应于该地方的对良善和真理的一种情感而实现的。此外，每位天使-人在离开这个世界后，都会被分配到自己的地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 68</h4><p>68. Heaven has been distinguished, as we said above, into as many societies as there are organs, viscera and members in the human being, and no constituent in these can be situated in any other place than its own. Consequently, since angels are such constituents in the Divine human in heaven, and no others become angels than those who have lived as people in the world, it follows that a person who allows himself to be led to heaven is continually being prepared by the Lord for his own place there, which is accomplished through that affection for goodness and truth that corresponds to it. Every angelic person is also assigned to this place after his departure from the world. <p>This is the inmost object of Divine providence as regards heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 68</h4><p>68. As already noted [<a href="65.htm">65</a>], heaven is divided into as many communities as there are organs, viscera, and members in us, and no part of these can be anywhere except where it belongs. Since angels are parts like this in the divine heavenly person, then, and only people who have lived on earth become angels, it follows that people who allow themselves to be led to heaven are constantly being prepared by the Lord for their places. This happens by means of the kind of desire for what is good and true that corresponds, and every angel-person is enrolled in this place after leaving our world. This is the very core of divine providence in respect to heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 68</h4><p>68. As was said above, heaven is divided into as many societies as there are organs, viscera and members in a man; and in these no part can be in any place but its own. Since, then, angels are such parts of the Divine Heavenly Man, and none can become angels but those who have been men in the world, it follows that the man who suffers himself to be led to heaven is continually prepared by the Lord for his own place; and this is done by means of such an affection of good and truth as corresponds with it. Moreover, to this place every angel man is assigned after his departure from the world. This is the inmost design of the Divine Providence in regard to heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 68</h4><p>68. It has been said above that heaven is divided into as many societies as there are organs, viscera, and members in Man, and in these no part can be in any place but its own. Consequently as angels are such parts of the Divine heavenly Man, and none become angels except such as have become men in the world, it follows that the man who permits himself to be led to heaven is continually prepared by the Lord for his own place; and this is done by means of such an affection for good and truth as corresponds with it. Moreover, every angel-man when he leaves this world is assigned to his place. This is the inmost of the Divine providence respecting heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 68 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>68. Est coelum, ut supra dictum est, in [tot] societates distinctum, quot sunt organa, viscera, et membra in homine, et in his non potest una pars in alio loco esse quam in suo: cum itaque angeli sunt tales partes in Divino coelesti Homine, et non alii fiunt angeli quam qui fuerunt homines in mundo, sequitur quod homo, qui se duci patitur ad coelum, a Domino continue praeparetur ad suum locum [ibi], quod fit per <sup>1</sup>talem affectionem boni et veri quae correspondet: in hunc locum etiam quisque homo angelus post excessum e mundo inscribitur. Hoc est intimum Divinae Providentiae de Coelo.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: pet </p>
