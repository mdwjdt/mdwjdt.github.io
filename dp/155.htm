<h4 align="center"></h4><p>155、⑴人唯独被主引领和教导。这一点是自然而然的，也是《圣爱与圣智》一书所阐述的全部内容的一个必然结果；那里的第一部分论述了主的神性之爱和神性智慧；第二部分论述了灵界的太阳和自然界的太阳；第三部分论述了层级；第四部分论述了宇宙的创造；第五部分论述了人的创造。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 155</h4><p>155. (1) A person is led and taught by the Lord alone. This observation follows as a universal consequence from all that we showed in our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom - from the points demonstrated there in Part One regarding the Lord's Divine love and His Divine wisdom; from those in Part Two regarding the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world; from those in Part Three regarding degrees; from those in Part Four regarding the creation of the universe; and from those in Part Five regarding the creation of mankind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 155</h4><p>155. 1. We are led and taught by the Lord alone. This flows naturally and inevitably from everything that was presented in the material about Divine Love and Wisdom--what was said there about the Lord's divine love and wisdom in part 1, about the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the physical world in part 2, about levels in part 3, about the creation of the universe in part 4, and about our own creation in part 5. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 155</h4><p>155. I. MAN IS LED AND TAUGHT BY THE LORD ALONE. This flows as a universal consequence from all that has been set forth in the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM; from what is there shown concerning the Lord's Divine Love and His Divine Wisdom in the First Part; concerning the Sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world in the Second Part; concerning degrees in the Third Part; concerning the creation of the universe in the Fourth Part; and concerning the creation of man in the Fifth Part. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 155</h4><p>155. (1) Man is led and taught by the Lord alone. This flows, as a universal consequent, from all that has been set forth in the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom; from what is there shown respecting the Lord's Divine love and His Divine wisdom in Part First, also respecting the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world in Part Second; also respecting degrees in Part Third, and also respecting the creation of the universe in Part Fourth; and respecting the creation of man in Part Fifth. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 155 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>155. I. Quod homo a solo Domino <sup>1</sup>ducatur et doceatur: hoc ut universale consequens fluit ex omnibus illis, quae in Transactione de DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA, ostensa sunt; tam ex illis, quae de Divino Amore Domini et de Divina Sapientia Ipsius in Parte Prima; quam quae de Sole Mundi spiritualis et de Sole Mundi naturalis in Parte secunda; tum quae de Gradibus in Parte tertia; et quae de Creatione Universi in Parte Quarta; ut et, quae de Creatione hominis in Parte Quinta, ibi demonstrata sunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: domino </p>
