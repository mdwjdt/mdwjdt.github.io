<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第47节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>47、由于此处论述的是圣治，并且要说明，圣治在它所做的一切事上都关注无限和永恒，还由于这一切若不按着某种顺序，就无法被阐明，所以顺序如下：<p>⑴无限本身和永恒本身与神性是一样的。<p>⑵无限和永恒本身必关注有限事物中来自它自身的无限（和永恒）之物。<p>⑶圣治在它所做的一切事，尤其在拯救人类上，都关注来自它自身的无限和永恒之物。<p>⑷一个无限和永恒的形像就存在于由得救的人类组成的天使天堂中。<p>⑸圣治的核心是在形成天使天堂的过程中关注无限和永恒之物，以使它能在主眼里如同一个人，也就是祂自己的一个形像。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 47</h4><p>47. Now because we are discussing Divine providence, saying here that in everything that it does it regards something infinite and eternal, and we cannot present this concept clearly except in some orderly sequence of ideas, therefore the sequence will be as follows: <p>(1) The infinite in itself and the eternal in itself is the same as the Divine. <p>(2) The infinite and eternal in itself cannot but regard something infinite and eternal from itself in finite things. <p>(3) In everything that it does, Divine providence regards something infinite and eternal from itself, especially in saving humankind. <p>(4) An image of the infinite and eternal is evident in the angelic heaven formed from a saved humankind. <p>(5) To regard infinity and eternity in forming the angelic heaven, that it may be in the Lord's sight as though a single person that is an image of Him, is the inmost object of Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 47</h4><p>47. Now, since we are dealing with divine providence, and are dealing at this point with the fact that it focuses on what is infinite and eternal in everything it does, and since this can be conveyed clearly only if it is put in a particular sequence, that sequence will be as follows: <p>1. What is intrinsically infinite and intrinsically eternal is the same as Divinity. <p>2. What is intrinsically infinite and eternal can only focus on what is infinite from itself in what is finite. <p>3. In everything it does, divine providence focuses on what is infinite and eternal from itself, especially in the intent to save the human race. <p>4. There is an image of what is infinite and eternal in the angelic heaven made up of members of the human race who have been saved. <p>5. The very core of divine providence is its focus on what is infinite and eternal in the forming of the angelic heaven so that it can be a single person in the Lord's sight, a person who is his image. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 47</h4><p>47. The Divine Providence is the subject now being treated of, and it is to be shown here that in everything it does it regards the infinite and the eternal. As this cannot be clearly set forth except in an orderly way, the order will be as follows:<p>I. The Infinite in itself and the Eternal in itself is the same as the Divine.<p>II. The Infinite and Eternal in itself cannot but regard what is infinite [and eternal] from itself in finite things.<p>III. The Divine Providence in everything it does regards what is infinite and eternal from itself, especially in saving the human race.<p>IV. An image of the Infinite and Eternal is presented in an angelic heaven from a saved human race.<p>V. The inmost of the Divine Providence is to regard what is infinite and eternal in forming the angelic heaven, in order that it may be before the Lord as one man, the image of Himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 47</h4><p>47. As the Divine providence is here treated of, and it is here to be shown that in every thing it does it looks to the Infinite and Eternal, and as this cannot be clearly set forth except in some order, the order shall be as follows:- <p>(1) The Infinite in itself and the Eternal in itself is the same as the Divine. <p>(2) The Infinite and Eternal in itself must needs look to what is infinite [and eternal] from itself in things finite. <p>(3) The Divine providence, in every thing it does, looks to what is infinite and eternal from itself, especially in saving the human race. <p>(4) An image of the Infinite and Eternal is presented in an angelic heaven from a saved human race. <p>(5) Looking to what is Infinite and Eternal in the formation of the angelic heaven, that it may be before the Lord as one man, which is an image of Himself, is the inmost of the Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 47 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>47. Nunc quia agitur de Divina Providentia, et hic quod illa in omni quod facit, spectet infinitum et aeternum, et hoc non potest distincte tradi, nisi in quodam ordine; quare hic ordo erit. <p>I. Quod Infinitum in se ac Aeternum in se sit idem cum Divino. <p>II. Quod Infinitum ac Aeternum in se non possit aliter quam spectare infinitum [et aeternum] <sup>1</sup>a se in finitis. <p>III. <sup>2</sup>Quod Divina Providentia in omni quod facit, spectet infinitum et aeternum a se, imprimis in salvando Genere humano. <p>IV. Quod imago Infiniti ac Aeterni exstet in Coelo Angelico ex salvato Genere humano. <p>V. Quod spectare infinitum et aeternum in formando Coelum Angelicum, ut sit coram Domino ut unus Homo, qui imago Ipsius, sit intimum Divinae Providentiae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 sic <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_47/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_52">52</a> infra<p>2 Prima editio: II. </p>
