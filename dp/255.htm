<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第255节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>255、②当看到伊斯兰教被许多国家和民族接受时，纯属世人或严格的唯物主义者就确认反对圣治。接受伊斯兰教的国家比接受基督教的还多，这一点对那些思想圣治，同时认为只有那些生为基督徒，也就是生在圣言所在之地，并通过圣言认识主的人才能得救的人来说，可能是一个绊脚石。但对那些认为一切都属于圣治的人来说，伊斯兰教不是一个绊脚石。这些人会了解这是怎么回事，并查清楚。正是由于圣治，伊斯兰教才承认主为神的儿子，是最有智慧的人，是降世教导世人的一个非常伟大的先知；大多数伊斯兰教徒都认为主比穆罕默德更伟大。<p>为清楚说明该宗教由主的圣治兴起，是为了摧毁许多民族的偶像崇拜，我需要按顺序来阐述，首先阐明偶像崇拜的起源。在伊斯兰教之前，偶像崇拜遍及全世界。这是因为主降世前的教会都是代表性教会。以色列教会就是这种。该教会的会幕、亚伦的衣服、祭物和属于耶路撒冷圣殿的一切，以及律例都具有代表性。古人当中有一种对应的知识，它包括代表的知识，是智者的基本知识。这种知识在埃及发展得特别好，是埃及象形文字的基础。他们根据这种知识来理解各种动物和各种树木的含义，以及大山、小山、河流、源泉和日月星辰的含义。正因他们的一切敬拜都具有代表性，完全由对应构成，所以他们在大山小山上，以及树林和园子里进行敬拜。这就是为何他们视源泉为圣，在崇拜神时面向升起的太阳。此外，他们制作了马、牛、牛犊、羔羊，甚至鸟、鱼和蛇的雕像，并根据它们所对应或代表的教会属灵事物，按次序把它们摆在家里和其它地方。他们还把类似事物摆在圣殿，好回想它们所表示的圣物。<p>在后来的时代，当对应的知识被遗忘时，他们的后代开始敬拜雕像本身，以为它们本身是神圣的。殊不知，他们的祖先在这些雕像里面看不见任何神圣之物，而是看到它们仅凭对应关系而代表，因而表示圣物。偶像崇拜由此产生，并遍布全世界，包括亚洲及其邻近岛屿，以及非洲和欧洲。为了根除这一切偶像崇拜，在主的圣治指引之下，一个适合东方人秉性的新宗教发展起来了。该宗教里面会有来自圣言新旧约的某种东西，并教导主降世，祂是最伟大的先知，最有智慧的人，是神的儿子。这一切由穆罕默德来完成，这就是为何该宗教被称为穆罕默德宗教。<p>在主的圣治之下，这个宗教被兴起，并适合东方人的秉性，如前所述，旨在摧毁如此多民族的偶像崇拜，并在人们进入灵界之前，赋予他们关于主的某种知识。这个宗教若不进行调整，并适合他们所有人的思想观念和生活，就不会被那么多国家接受，也没有能力根除偶像崇拜。东方人之所以不承认主为天地之神，是因为他们认为神是宇宙的创造者，无法理解祂如何能降世并取得人性。事实上，就连基督徒都不明白这一点，所以他们在思维上将祂的神性与人性分开，将神性与天父联系在一起，却不知道如何处理祂的人性。<p>由此可见，伊斯兰教也是在主的圣治指引之下兴起的；凡承认主是神的儿子，同时照十诫的律法（他们也有十诫）通过避恶如罪生活的伊斯兰教徒，都会进入一个被称为伊斯兰天堂的天堂。该天堂也分为三层天堂，即：一个最高层天堂，一个中间层天堂和一个最低层天堂。那些承认主与父为一，因而是独一神的伊斯兰教徒进入最高层天堂；那些放弃多个妻子，只与一位妻子共同生活的伊斯兰教徒进入第二层天堂；那些开始踏上这条路的伊斯兰教徒进入最低层或第一层天堂。关于伊斯兰教，详情可参看《最后的审判续》<a href="../clj/68.htm">（68-72节）</a>，那里论述了伊斯兰教徒和穆罕默德。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 255</h4><p>255. (2) That the merely natural person confirms himself against Divine providence when he considers the Muslim religion - that it has been adopted by so many empires and kingdoms: The fact that this religion has been adopted by more kingdoms than the Christian religion may pose a difficulty for people who think about Divine providence and at the same time believe that no one else can be saved but one who has been born a Christian, thus born where the Word exists and where by it the Lord is known. But the Muslim religion is not a difficulty to those who believe that all things are of Divine providence. Such people inquire into where that providence lies, and moreover discover it. <p>The Divine providence in the present instance lies in this, that the Muslim religion acknowledges the Lord as the Son of God, the wisest of men, and as a very great prophet, who came into the world to teach mankind. A large majority of its adherents make Him greater than Muhammad.</p><p>[2] To have it fully known that this religion was raised up of the Lord's Divine providence to put an end to the idolatries of many nations, we need to consider it in some order. First, then, regarding the origin of idolatrous worship: <p>Before the Muslim religion arose, worship of idols commonly existed throughout the world. The reason for this was that the churches before the Lord's Advent were all representational churches. The Israelite Church was even such a church. The tabernacle in it, the vestments of Aaron, the sacrifices, all the appointments of the Temple at Jerusalem, and moreover the statutes, were representative. Furthermore, among the ancients there was a knowledge of correspondences, which includes a knowledge of representations. It was the principal study of the wise, cultivated especially by the Egyptians, from which came their hieroglyphics. <p>From that study they knew what animals of every kind symbolized, also trees of every kind, likewise mountains, hills, rivers, springs, and so too the sun, moon and stars. And because all of their worship was representational, consisting of nothing but correspondent forms, therefore they held rites of worship on mountains and hills, and likewise in groves and gardens. Therefore they also consecrated springs, and in their venerations turned their faces to the rising eastern sun. Moreover they made carved images of horses, bulls, calves, lambs, indeed of birds, fishes, and serpents, and placed these in their houses and elsewhere, setting them in an order to reflect the spiritual things of the church to which they corresponded or which they represented. <p>They also placed objects like these in their temples, to recall to mind the sacred things which the objects symbolized.</p><p>[3] Sometime later, when a knowledge of correspondences became extinguished, their posterity began to worship the carved figures themselves as sacred in themselves, not knowing that their ancient forebears did not see any intrinsic sacredness in them, but only that they represented and so symbolized sacred things by virtue of their correspondences. In consequence of this idolatries arose, which filled the whole world, both the Asiatic world with its surrounding islands and the African and European worlds. <p>In order to eradicate all these idolatries, it came to pass of the Lord's Divine providence that a new religion was introduced, accommodated to the native characters of eastern peoples, in which there would be something from each of the two Testaments of the Word - a religion which would teach that the Lord came into the world, and that He was a very great prophet, the wisest of all men, and the Son of God. This was accomplished through Muhammad, from whom this religion received the name Muhammadanism.</p><p>[4] This religion was raised up of the Lord's Divine providence and accommodated, as said, to the native characters of eastern peoples, in order to put an end to the idolatries of so many nations, and to provide them with some awareness of the Lord before they came into the spiritual world. This religion would not have been adopted by so many countries, and would not have been able to eradicate their idolatries, unless it was conformable and adapted to the ideas of all their thoughts and life. <p>The reason it did not acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth was that eastern peoples acknowledged God to be the Creator of the universe, and they could not comprehend how He could come into the world and assume a humanity - even as Christians do not comprehend it, who in their thinking therefore separate His Divinity from His humanity, and place His Divinity alongside the Father in heaven, and His humanity they know not where.</p><p>[5] It can be seen from this that the Muslim religion also arose of the Lord's Divine providence, and that all the adherents of that religion come into heaven who acknowledge the Lord as the Son of God and who at the same time, by refraining from evils as sins, live according to the precepts of the Decalogue, which they, too, have. <p>They come into a heaven called the Muslim heaven. This heaven, too, has been divided into three heavens - a highest one, an intermediate one, and a lowest one. In the highest heaven are those who acknowledge the Lord as one with the Father, and thus as being Himself the only God. In the second heaven are those who renounce a plurality of wives and live with only one. And in the lowest heaven are those who are being initiated. <p>More about this religion may be seen in <a href="../slj/68.htm">A Continuation Concerning the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World 68-72</a>, where Muslims and Muhammad are discussed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 255</h4><p>255. 2. Strict materialists justify their rejection of divine providence when they see that Islam has been accepted by so many empires and nations. The fact that this religion has been accepted by more nations than Christianity can be a real problem for people who give thought to divine providence and also believe that we cannot be saved unless we have been born Christian, born, that is, where the Word is and people therefore know about the Lord. Islam presents no problem, though, to people who believe that divine providence is over everything. They try to discern where it is, and they find it. It is because of divine providence that Islam recognizes the Lord as the Son of God, the wisest of mortals, and a supreme prophet, one who came into the world to teach us. Most of them regard him as greater than Muhammad.</p><p>[2] To make it abundantly clear that this religion was prompted by the Lord's divine providence in order to eliminate the idolatrous practices of many nations, I need to lay things out in sequence, so I shall start with the origins of idolatry. <p>Before Islam, the worship of idols was widespread over the whole world. This was because the churches that existed before the Lord's coming were "symbolic churches." The Israelite church was like this, with its tabernacle, Aaron's garments, its sacrifices, all the furnishings of the temple in Jerusalem, and its laws. All of these were symbolic. Further, for our early ancestors the knowledge of correspondential relationships, which are also symbolic, was the essential knowledge of the sages. It was especially developed in Egypt, and was the basis of their hieroglyphs. On the basis of this knowledge they understood the meaning of all kinds of animals and all kinds of trees, as well as the meaning of mountains, hills, rivers, and springs, of the sun, the moon, and the stars. It was because their worship was symbolic, wholly made up of correspondences, that they conducted their worship on mountains and hills and in groves and gardens. That is why they regarded springs as holy and turned their faces toward the sun in reverence to God. Particularly, it is why they made statues of horses, cattle, calves, and sheep, even of birds, fish, and snakes, and set them up in their houses and elsewhere in patterns that embodied the spiritual characteristics of the church that they reflected or symbolized. They put similar images in their temples to call to their minds the holy things that they symbolized.</p><p>[3] In later times, when the knowledge of correspondential relationships had been forgotten, their descendants began to worship the images as holy in and of themselves. They did not realize that their ancestors had not seen anything holy about them, but saw them simply as symbolizing and therefore pointing to something holy by virtue of their correspondence. This was how the idolatry started that was to fill the whole world, including Asia, its surrounding islands, Africa, and Europe. <p>In order to uproot all these idolatrous practices, under the auspices of divine providence a new religion developed that was appropriate to the character of people of the Near East. In this religion there would be material from both Testaments of the Word to teach that the Lord had come into the world and that he was the greatest prophet, the wisest of all, and the son of God. The agent of this was Muhammad, which is why the religion is called Muhammadanism.</p><p>[4] This religion, which as just noted was suited to the character of the people of the Near East, was awakened under the Lord's divine providence in order to counter the idolatrous beliefs of so many people and to give them some awareness of the Lord before they entered the spiritual world. This religion would not have been accepted by all these nations, it would not have been able to uproot their idolatrous practices, unless it had been made concordant with and suitable to the mental concepts and the lives of all these people. <p>The reason they did not recognize the Lord as the God of heaven and earth was that the people of the Near East believed in God as the Creator of the universe and could not grasp the idea that he had come into the world and taken on a human nature. Actually, Christians cannot grasp this either, so in thought they separate his divine nature from his human nature, associate divinity with the Father in heaven, and do not know what to do with the humanity.</p><p>[5] We can see from this that Islam too was started under the guidance of the Lord's divine providence and that all its adherents who believe in the Lord as the Son of God and live by the laws of the Ten Commandments (which they also have) by abstaining from evils as sins, come into a heaven called the Islamic heaven. This heaven is divided into three heavens, the highest, the intermediate, and the lowest. Muslims who believe that the Lord is one with the Father and is the only God come into the highest; people who give up polygamy and live with one wife come into the second; and people who are starting on this path come into the first. <p>There is more on this in my Supplements on the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World 68-72, where Muslims and Muhammad are discussed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 255</h4><p>255. 2. The merely natural man confirms himself against the Divine Providence when he sees that the Mohammedan religion is accepted by so many empires and kingdoms. That this form of religion is accepted by more kingdoms than the Christian religion may be a stumbling-block to those who think about the Divine Providence, and who at the same time believe that no one can be saved unless he has been born a Christian, thus where the Word is by which the Lord is known. But the Mohammedan form of religion is not a stumbling-block to those who believe that all things are of the Divine Providence. They inquire how such a thing can be, and they find the answer in this, that the Mohammedan religion acknowledges the Lord as the Son of God, the wisest of men and a very great prophet who came into the world to teach men; and most Mohammedans consider the Lord to be greater than Mohammed.</p><p>[2] To make it fully understood that this form of religion was raised up by the Divine Providence of the Lord to destroy the idolatries of many nations, it will be set forth in an orderly account beginning with some observations on the origin of idolatries. Previous to the religion of Mohammed the worship of idols was common throughout the whole world. This was because the Churches before the Coming of the Lord were all representative Churches. Such was the Israelitish Church. In it the tabernacle, the garments of Aaron, the sacrifices, all things belonging to the temple at Jerusalem, and also the statutes, were representative. Moreover, among the Ancients there was the science of correspondences, which is also the science of representatives, the science of the wise. This was especially cultivated in Egypt, and is the source of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. From this science they knew the signification of animals of every kind, also the signification of trees of every kind, and of mountains, hills, rivers and fountains, and also of the sun, moon and stars; and as all their worship was representative, consisting wholly of correspondences, they celebrated it on mountains and hills, and also in groves and gardens. For the same reason they also regarded fountains as holy, and in their adoration of God they turned their faces to the rising sun. Moreover, they made graven images of horses, oxen, calves, lambs and also of birds, fishes and serpents, and set them up in their houses and other places in an order according to the spiritual things of the Church to which they corresponded or which they represented. They also placed similar objects in their temples that they might bring to remembrance the holy things which they signified.</p><p>[3] In the course of time, when the science of correspondences had been lost, their posterity began to worship the graven images themselves, as being holy in themselves, not knowing that their forefathers had seen no holiness in those things, but only that they represented and consequently signified holy things according to correspondences. Hence arose the idolatries which filled the whole world, Asia with its neighbouring islands, as well as Africa and Europe. In order that all these idolatries might be rooted out it was brought about by the Divine Providence of the Lord that a new religion should arise, adapted to the genius of Orientals, in which there should be something from both Testaments of the Word and which should teach that the Lord came into the world, and that He was a very great prophet, the wisest of all men, and the Son of God. This was effected by means of Mohammed, from whom that religion is called the Mohammedan religion.</p><p>[4] By the Divine Providence of the Lord this religion was raised up and adapted to the genius of Orientals, as was just stated, to the end that it might destroy the idolatries practised by so many nations and give the people some knowledge concerning the Lord before they entered the spiritual world. This religion would not have been received by so many kingdoms with power to extirpate idolatries if it had not been suited and adapted to the ideas of thought and life of them all. It did not acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth because Oriental peoples acknowledged God as the Creator of the universe, but they could not comprehend that He came into the world and assumed the Human, even as Christians do not comprehend this, who consequently in their thought separate His Divine from His Human, and place the Divine near the Father in heaven and His Human they know not where.</p><p>[5] Hence it may be seen that the Mohammedan religion also arose from the Divine Providence of the Lord; and that all persons of that religion who acknowledge the Lord as the Son of God and at the same time live according to the precepts of the Decalogue, which they also have, by shunning evils as sins, come into a heaven called the Mohammedan heaven. This heaven is also divided into three, the highest, middle and lowest. In the highest heaven are those who acknowledge the Lord to be one with the Father, and thus to be Himself the only God; in the second heaven are those who renounce a plurality of wives and live with one; and in the lowest are those who are being initiated. More about this religion may be seen in THE CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT AND CONCERNING THE SPIRITUAL WORLD (n. <a href="../clj/68.htm">68-72</a>), where the Mohammedans and Mohammed are treated of. </p>

That this religion is accepted by more kingdoms than the Christian religion may be a stumbling-block to those who think about the Divine providence and who at the same time believe that only those who are born Christians, that is, those where the Word is, and by it the Lord is known, can be saved. But the Mohammedan religion is not a stumbling-block to those who believe that all things belong to the Divine providence. Such inquire how this is, and they find out; it is in this, that the Mohammedan religion acknowledges the Lord as the Son of God, as the wisest of men, and as a very great prophet who came into the world to teach men; a great part of the Mohammedans make Him greater than Mohammed.</p><p>[2] To make it fully clear that this religion was raised up by the Lord's Divine providence to destroy the idolatries of many nations it shall be set forth in a certain order. First, then, respecting the origin of idolatry. Previous to that religion the worship of idols was common throughout the world. This was because the churches before the coming of the Lord were all representative churches. Such was the Israelitish church. In that church the tabernacle, Aaron's garments, the sacrifices, all things belonging to the temple at Jerusalem, and the statutes, were representative. Among the ancients there was a knowledge of correspondences (which includes a knowledge of representatives), the essential knowledge of the wise; and this was especially cultivated in Egypt, and from it their hieroglyphics were derived. From that knowledge they knew the signification of animals of every kind, also the signification of all kinds of trees, and of mountains, hills, rivers, fountains, and also of the sun, the moon, and the stars. And as all their worship was representative, consisting of pure correspondences, they worshiped on mountains and hills, and also in groves and gardens, and they consecrated fountains, and in their adoration of God they turned their faces to the rising sun; moreover they made graven images of horses, oxen, calves, lambs, and even birds and fishes, and serpents; and at home and elsewhere they placed these in an order in conformity to the spiritual things of the church to which they corresponded, or which they represented. They also placed like things in their temples, to call to remembrance the holy things which they signified.</p><p>[3] After a time, when the knowledge of correspondences had been lost, their posterity began to worship the graven images themselves, as holy in themselves, not knowing that their fathers of ancient time had seen no holiness in them, but that they merely represented and thus signified holy things, according to correspondences. From this the idolatries arose which filled the whole world, Asia with the neighboring islands, Africa, and Europe. To extirpate all these idolatries it came to pass, under the Lord's Divine providence, that a new religion arose, adapted to the genius of Orientals, in which there was something from the Word of both Testaments, and which taught that the Lord came into the world, and that He was the greatest prophet, the wisest of men, and the Son of God. This was done through Mohammed, from whom that religion was called the Mohammedan religion.</p><p>[4] Under the Lord's Divine providence this religion was raised up and adapted to the genius of Orientals, as has been said, to the end that it might destroy the idolatries of so many nations, and give them some knowledge of the Lord before they entered the spiritual world. And this religion would not have been accepted by so many kingdoms, and would have been powerless to extirpate idolatries, if it had not been adapted and suited to the ideas of thought and to the life of them all. It did not acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, because Orientals acknowledged God as the Creator of the universe, and were unable to comprehend how He could come into the world and assume the Human; even as Christians do not comprehend this, and consequently in their thought separate His Divine from His Human, and place the Divine near the Father in heaven, and His Human they know not where.</p><p>[5] From all this it can be seen that the Mohammedan religion arose under the Lord's Divine providence; and that all of that religion who acknowledge the Lord as the Son of God, and at the same time live according to the commandments of the Decalogue (which they also have), by shunning evils as sins, come into a heaven that is called the Mohammedan heaven. This heaven, too, is divided into three heavens, a highest, a middle, and a lowest. In the highest heaven are those who acknowledge the Lord to be one with the Father, and thus to be Himself the only God; in the second heaven are those who give up their many wives, and live with one wife; and in the lowest those who are being initiated.

<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 255 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>255. II. Quod mere naturalis homo contra Divinam Providentiam se confirmet, cum spectat Religiosum Mahumedanum, quod <sup>1</sup>a tot imperiis et regnis receptum sit: quod hoc Religiosum receptum sit a pluribus Regnis quam religio Christiana, potest scandalo esse illis, qui de Divina Providentia cogitant, et simul credunt, quod non aliquis salvari possit, nisi qui Christianus natus est, ita ubi Verbum est, et per id Dominus notus est: ast Religiosum Mahumedanum non est scandalum illis, qui credunt quod omnia sint Divinae Providentiae; hi inquirunt in quo est, et quoque inveniunt: est in eo, quod Mahumedana Religio agnoscat Dominum pro Filio Dei, Sapientissimo hominum, proque Maximo Propheta, qui in Mundum venit ut doceret homines; plurima pars illorum Ipsum majorem Mahumede faciunt.</p><p>[2] Ut plene sciatur, quod illud Religiosum ex Divina Domini Providentia exsuscitatum sit ad delendum idololatrias plurium gentium, in aliquo ordine dicetur, quare primum de origine idololatriarum. Ante illud Religiosum fuit cultus idolorum communis in toto terrarum orbe: causa fuit, quia Ecclesiae ante adventum Domini fuerunt omnes Ecclesiae Repraesentativae; talis etiam fuit Ecclesia Israelitica; ibi tentorium, vestes Aharonis, sacrificia, omnia Templi Hierosolymitani, et quoque statuta repraesentabant; et apud antiquos fuit scientia correspondentiarum, quae etiam est repraesentationum, ipsa scientia sapientium, imprimis exculta in Aegypto; inde illorum Hieroglyphica: ex illa scientia sciverunt, quid significabant omnis generis animalia, tum quid omnis generis arbores, ut et quid montes, colles, fluvii, fontes, et quoque quid sol, luna, stellae; et quia omnis cultus illorum erat repraesentativus, consistens ex meris correspondentiis, ideo super montibus et collibus, et quoque in lucis et hortis, habuerunt cultus, ac ideo fontes sanctificabant, et ad solem orientem in adorationibus Dei vertebant facies, et insuper sculptiles equos, boves, vitulos, agnos, imo aves, pisces, serpentes, fecerunt, et hos posuerunt domi et alibi in ordine secundum spiritualia Ecclesiae, quibus correspondebant seu quae repraesentabant. Similia etiam posuerunt in suis Templis, ut in reminiscentiam revocarent sancta quae significabant. <sup>2</sup></p><p>[3] Post tempus, <sup>3</sup>quando scientia correspondentiarum obliterata fuit, incepit posteritas colere ipsa sculptilia ut in se sancta, nescientes quod antiqui parentes illorum non viderint aliquid sancti in illis, sed solum quod secundum correspondentias repraesentarent et inde significarent sancta. Inde ortae sunt idololatriae, quae impleverunt totum terrarum Orbem, tam Asiaticum cum insulis circum, quam Africanum et Europaeum. <sup>4</sup>Ut omnes illae Idololatriae exstirparentur, ex Divina Domini Providentia factum est, ut nova Religio <sup>5</sup>geniis Orientalium <sup>6</sup>accommodata auspicaretur, <sup>7</sup>in qua aliquid ex utroque Testamento Verbi foret, et quae doceret quod Dominus in mundum venerit, et quod Ille esset maximus Propheta, sapientissimus omnium, et Filius Dei: hoc factum est per Mahumedem, ex quo Religio ista vocata est Religio Mahumedana. <sup>8</sup></p><p>[4] Haec religio ex Divina Domini Providentia exsuscitata est, ac geniis Orientalium, ut dictum est, accommodata, ob finem ut deleret idololatrias tot gentium, ac daret aliquam cognitionem de Domino, antequam in Mundum spiritualem venirent; quae Religio non recepta fuisset a tot Regnis, et potuisset idololatrias exstirpare, nisi conveniens et adaequata ideis cogitationum et vitae omnium illorum facta fuisset. Quod non agnoverit Dominum pro Deo Coeli et terrae, erat causa quia Orientales agnoverunt Deum Creatorem Universi, et non comprehendere potuerunt, quod Ille in mundum venerit, et assumserit Humanum; sicut nec illud comprehendunt Christiani, qui ideo in cogitatione sua separant Divinum Ipsius ab Humano Ipsius, ac Divinum ponunt juxta Patrem in Coelo, ac Humanum Ipsius non sciunt ubi.</p><p>[5] Ex his videri potest, quod Mahumedana Religio etiam ex Divina Domini Providentia orta sit; et quod omnes illi ex ea Religione, qui Dominum pro Filio Dei agnoscunt, et simul secundum praecepta decalogi, quae etiam illis sunt, vivunt, fugiendo mala ut peccata, in Coelum, quod vocatur Coelum Mahumedanum, veniant: hoc Coelum etiam divisum est in tres Coelos, supremum, medium et infimum; in supremo Coelo sunt, qui Dominum unum cum Patre agnoscunt, et sic Ipsum Solum Deum: in altero Coelo <sup>9</sup>sunt qui abdicant plures uxores, et cum una vivunt; et in ultimo, qui initiantur.
