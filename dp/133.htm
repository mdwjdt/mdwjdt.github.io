<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第133节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>133、然而，神迹对善人和恶人的影响是不同的。善人并不渴望神迹，但他们相信圣言中所记载的神迹。他们若听说有关神迹的任何事，也只是作为强化其信仰的无足轻重的论据来思想它，因为他们从圣言，因而从主思考，而不是从神迹思考。恶人则不然。他们确实能被神迹驱使和强迫去信仰，甚至敬拜和虔诚，只是持续的时间很短；因为他们的邪恶还被压抑在里面；他们的恶欲和由此而来的快乐不断作用于他们外在的敬拜和虔诚。为了从这种禁锢中挣脱出来，这些人反思神迹，最终称之为一个把戏，一个诡计，或自然事件，从而回到他们的邪恶。人若敬拜之后又回到邪恶，就会亵渎敬拜的良善和真理；亵渎圣物的人死后的命运是最糟糕的。主在马太福音<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">（12:43-45）</a>中的话说的就是这些人，即：他们末后的境况比先前更不好。此外，如果神迹的发生真的有助于那些不相信圣言中的神迹之人，那么它们必在这些人能看得见的地方不断发生。这一切清楚表明为何如今神迹不再发生。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 133</h4><p>133. Still, the effect of miracles in the case of good people is different from that in the case of evil people. Good people do not wish for miracles, but they believe the miracles that are in the Word. Moreover, if they hear of some miracle, they pay no attention to it other than as a minor proof that confirms their faith; for they form their thinking from the Word, thus from the Lord, and not from any miracle. <p>It is otherwise, however, with evil people. They can indeed be forced and compelled to belief by miracles, even to worship and piety, but only for a short time. For their evils are shut in, and the lusts and consequent delights of those evils continually work upon their external show of worship and piety. In order that these may emerge from their prison and break out of it then, they think about the miracle and eventually call it either a fake or trick, or a phenomenon of nature, and so go back to their evils. One who goes back to his evils after worshiping profanes the truths and goods of worship, and the lot of profaners after death is the worst of all. These are the people meant by the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a>, <sup>1</sup>whose last state is worse than the first. <p>Besides, if miracles were to be done among people who do not believe as a result of the miracles in the Word, they would be done constantly and visibly among all people like that. <p>It can be seen from this why it is that miracles are not done today. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp; "When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first." </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 133</h4><p>133. However, the effect of miracles on good people is different from their effect on evil people. Good people have no desire for miracles, but they believe the miracles in the Word. If they do hear anything about a miracle, they think of it only as a minor argument that strengthens their faith, because they base their thinking on the Word and therefore on the Lord and not on the miracle. <p>It is different for evil people. They can actually be constrained and compelled to faith and even to worship and devotion by miracles. This lasts only a short while, though, because their evils are pent up inside, and the compulsions and gratifications of those evils are constantly working away inside their outward worship and devotion. In the effort to let them break free of this confinement, these people think about the miracle and wind up calling it a sham, a trick, or a natural event, which enables them to return to their evil ways. People who go back to their evil ways after being worshipful profane what is good and true in worship, and the fate after death of people who profane what is holy is the worst of all. These are the people referred to in the Lord's discourse in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matthew 12:43-44</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_45.htm">45</a>, the people whose last state is worse than the first. <p>Besides, if miracles did happen for people who do not believe in the miracles in the Word, they would be happening constantly where everyone like this could see them. This shows why miracles do not happen nowadays. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 133</h4><p>133. The effect, however, of miracles on the good and on the wicked is different. The good do not desire miracles, but they believe those recorded in the Word; and if they hear anything concerning a miracle they give it their attention only as an argument of no great weight that confirms their faith; for their thoughts are derived from the Word, consequently from the Lord, and not from the miracle. It is otherwise with the wicked. They may indeed be driven and compelled to a faith by miracles, and even to worship and to piety, but only for a short time. For their evils are shut in, and the lusts of their evils and the delights springing from these lusts continually act upon their external of worship and piety; and in order that their evils may emerge from their confinement and break forth, they reflect upon the miracle and at length call it an amusing artifice or a natural phenomenon, and so return to their evils. Now he who after worship returns to his evils profanes the truth and good of worship; and the lot after death of those who commit profanation is the worst of all. These are they who are meant by the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a>, whose last state is worse than their first. Moreover, if miracles were to be wrought with those who do not believe from the miracles in the Word, they would be performed continually, and in view of all such persons. From these considerations it may be evident why miracles are not wrought at this day. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 133</h4><p>133. But the effect of miracles on the good and on the evil is different. The good do not desire miracles, but they believe in the miracles recorded in the Word. And when they hear anything about a miracle they give thought to it only as an argument of no great weight that confirms their faith; for they think from the Word, thus from the Lord, and not from the miracle. It is not so with the evil. They may be driven and compelled to a belief by miracles, and even to worship and piety, but only for a short time; for their evils are shut in; and the lusts of their evils and the enjoyments therefrom continually act upon their external of worship and piety; and in order to get out of their confinement and break away they reflect upon the miracle, and at length call it a trick or artifice, or a work of nature, and thus go back to their evils. And he who returns to his evils after he has worshiped profanes the goods and truths of worship; and the lot after death of those who commit profanation is the worst of all. Such as these are meant by the Lord's words (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a>), that their last state becomes worse than the first. Furthermore, if it is needful to work miracles for the sake of those who do not believe from miracles in the Word, they must be wrought for all such continually and visibly. All this makes clear why miracles are not wrought at this day. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 133 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>133. Sed alius effectus <sup>1</sup>miraculorum est apud bonos quam apud malos: boni non volunt miracula, sed credunt miracula quae in Verbo sunt; et si audiunt aliquid de miraculo, non attendunt aliter ad illud quam sicut ad leve argumentum quod confirmat fidem eorum, nam illi a Verbo, ita a Domino cogitant, et non ex miraculo. Aliter vero mali; illi quidem per miracula possunt adigi et cogi ad fidem, imo ad cultum et ad pietatem, sed solum ad paucum tempus, nam mala eorum inclusa sunt, quorum concupiscentiae et inde jucunda continue agunt in externum cultus et pietatis eorum, ac ut exeant e claustro suo et erumpant, cogitant de miraculo, et tandem vocant illud ludibrium vel artificium, vel opus naturae, et sic redeunt in sua mala; et qui redit in sua mala post cultum, ille prophanat vera et bona cultus, ac prophanatorum sors post <sup>2</sup>mortem est omnium pessima: hi sunt qui intelliguntur per Domini verba apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_133/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_43-45">Matthaeus 12:43-45</a>; quorum status posterior fit pejor priori. <sup>3</sup>Praeterea si miracula apud illos, qui non credunt ex miraculis in Verbo, fierent, continue fierent, et coram visu apud omnes tales. Ex his constare potest, <sup>4</sup>unde est quod miracula hodie non fiant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: essectus<p>2 Prima editio: poff<p>3 Prima editio: priori.<p>4 Prima editio: potest; </p>
