<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第42节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>42、⑸人与主结合得越紧密，在他自己看来，他越明显是自己的主人，也越清楚地认识到他属于主。有这样一种表象：人与主结合得越紧密，就越不是自己的主人。这种表象普遍存在于一切恶人中间，也普遍存在于那些出于宗教认为自己不受律法约束，没有人能凭自己行善的人中间。所有这些人不可避免地认为，不允许思想和意愿邪恶，只能思想和意愿良善，就不是自己的主人。由于那些与主结合的人既不意愿，也不能思想和意愿邪恶，所以他们从这种表象得出结论，这不是做自己的主人。然而，这与真理完全相反。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 42</h4><p>42. (5) The more closely a person is conjoined with the Lord, the more distinctly does he appear to himself to be his own person, and the more clearly does he recognize that he is the Lord's. It seems from the appearance that the more closely one is conjoined with the Lord, the less he is his own person. Such is the appearance with all evil people, and also with those who believe, in accordance with their religion, that they are not under the yoke of the law <sup>1</sup>and that no one can do good of himself. For neither the former nor the latter can see anything other than that to be permitted to think and will only good and not evil is not to be one's own person. Moreover, because people who have been conjoined with the Lord are neither willing nor able to think and will evil, they conclude from the appearance with them that this is not to be one's own person. And yet the complete opposite is the case. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp; See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_15_1.htm">Acts 15:1-11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/galatians_4_21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a>-<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/galatians_5_1.htm">5:1</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 42</h4><p>42. 5. The more closely we are united to the Lord, the more clearly we seem to have our own identity, and yet the more obvious it is to us that we belong to the Lord. It seems as though the more closely we are united to the Lord the less sense of identity we have. This is indeed how it seems to all evil people and to people who believe on religious grounds that they are not subject to the yoke of the law and that none of us can do anything good on our own. These two kinds of people cannot help seeing that if they are not allowed to think and intend what is evil, but only what is good, they have lost their identity. Since people who are united to the Lord are neither willing nor able to think and intend what is evil, the outward appearance leads others to believe that this amounts to a loss of identity; yet it is the exact opposite. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 42</h4><p>42. V. THE MORE NEARLY A MAN IS CONJOINED TO THE LORD THE MORE DISTINCTLY DOES HE APPEAR TO HIMSELF TO BE MASTER OF HIMSELF [suus], AND YET THE MORE EVIDENTLY DOES HE RECOGNISE THAT HE IS THE LORD'S. There is an appearance that the more nearly anyone is conjoined to the Lord the less he is master of himself. This is the appearance with all the wicked, and also with those who from their religion believe that they are not under the yoke of the law, and that no one can do good from himself. For all such are only able to see that not to be allowed to think and to will evil, but only good, is not to be master of oneself; and as those who are conjoined to the Lord are neither willing nor able to think and to will evil, they conclude from what is an appearance to them that this is not to be master of oneself; when nevertheless this is quite contrary to the truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 42</h4><p>42. (5) The more nearly a man is conjoined with the Lord the more distinctly does he seem to himself as if he were his own, and the more clearly does he recognize that he is the Lord's. There is an appearance that the more nearly one is conjoined with the Lord the less he is his own. It so appears to all who are evil; and it so appears also to those who believe from their religion that they are not under the yoke of the law, and that no one can do good from himself. For all such are unable to see otherwise than that not to be one's own means not to be allowed to think and will evil, but only good; and as those who are conjoined with the Lord are neither willing nor able to think and will evil, all such conclude from the appearance to themselves, that this is not to be one's own. This, however, is the exact opposite of the truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 42 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>42. V. Quod homo quo propius conjungitur <sup>1</sup>Domino, eo distinctius appareat sibi sicut sit suus, ac evidentius animadvertat quod sit Domini. Ex apparentia est, quod quo propius aliquis conjunctus est Domino, eo minus suus sit; talis apparentia est apud omnes malos, et quoque apud illos qui ex religione credunt, quod non sint sub jugo legis, et quod nemo possit facere bonum a se; hi et illi enim non possunt aliter videre, quam quod non licere cogitare et velle malum, sed solummodo bonum, non sit <sup>2</sup>suus esse; et quia illi qui conjuncti sunt Domino non volunt nec possunt cogitare et velle malum, ex apparentia apud se <sup>3</sup>concludunt, <sup>4</sup>quod hoc non sit suus esse: cum tamen prorsus contrarium est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: canjungitur<p>2 Prima editio: sir<p>3 Prima editio: fe<p>4 Prima editio: concluduut, </p>
