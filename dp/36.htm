<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第36节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>36、到达感知的智慧是出于对真理的情感而对真理的感知，尤其是对属灵真理的感知。因为真理有文明的、道德的和属灵的。那些出于对真理的情感而拥有对属灵真理的某种感知的人，也拥有对文明和道德真理的感知，因为对属灵真理的情感是这些感知的灵魂。我有时与天使谈论智慧，他们说，智慧就是与主结合，因为主就是智慧本身，一个将地狱从自己身上逐出的人就会获得这种结合，并且这种结合与逐出地狱的程度成正比。他们还说，他们把智慧描绘为一座宏伟、华丽的宫殿，通过十二级台阶才能登上。他们说，若不靠着主，凭借与祂的结合，甚至没有人能到达第一级台阶；每个人都照着结合的程度而上升，并且随着他上升，他发觉，人获得智慧不是凭他自己，而是靠着主。此外，他们说，人所知道的之于他所不知道的，犹如几滴水之于大湖泊。进入智慧宫殿的十二级台阶是指与真理结合的良善和与良善结合的真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 36</h4><p>36. The wisdom which comes to a person's perception is a perception of truth from an affection for it, especially a perception of spiritual truth. For there is civil truth, moral truth, and spiritual truth. People who have a perception of spiritual truth from an affection for it also have a perception of moral and civil truth, for an affection for spiritual truth is the soul of these perceptions. <p>I have sometimes spoken with angels about wisdom, and the angels have said that wisdom is conjunction with the Lord, because the Lord is wisdom itself, and that one who casts out hell from himself comes into that conjunction, and comes into it to the extent that he casts hell out. <p>The angels said that they represent wisdom to themselves as a magnificent and very ornate palace, into which one ascends by twelve steps. No one, they said, arrives at the first step except as a result of the Lord by conjunction with Him; that everyone ascends in the measure of the conjunction; and that as he ascends, he perceives that no one is wise of himself, but from the Lord. Moreover, they said that those things which he is wise about, in comparison to those things which he is not wise about, are as a few drops of water to a great lake. <p>The twelve steps to the palace of wisdom symbolize goods conjoined with truths and truths conjoined with goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 36</h4><p>36. The wisdom that comes to our consciousness is a sense of what is true prompted by a desire for it. This is the case particularly for spiritual truth: for there is civic truth, there is moral truth, and there is spiritual truth. When we are conscious of spiritual truth because we are drawn to it we are conscious of moral and civic truth as well, because a desire for spiritual truth is their soul. <p>I have talked with angels about wisdom on occasion, and they have told me that wisdom is union with the Lord because the Lord is wisdom itself. They have told me that they attain this union when they banish hell from themselves, and that the union is in direct proportion to the banishment. <p>They picture wisdom, they said, as a wonderfully elegant palace with twelve steps leading up to it. No one gets to the first step except with the Lord's help and by union with him, and for all of us, the ascent depends on that union. The higher we climb, the more clearly we realize that no one is wise on her or his own, but only from the Lord. We also realize that relative to what we do not know, what we do know is like a droplet compared to a vast lake. The twelve steps to the palace of wisdom mean whatever is good united to what is true and whatever is true united to what is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 36</h4><p>36. The wisdom that comes to perception is a perception of truth from an affection for it, especially a perception of spiritual truth; for there is civil truth, moral truth and spiritual truth. Those who are in the perception of spiritual truth from an affection for it are also in the perception of moral and civil truth, for of these perceptions the affection of spiritual truth is the soul. I have sometimes conversed with angels about wisdom; and they said that wisdom is conjunction with the Lord, because the Lord is Wisdom itself; and that a man attains that conjunction who casts hell out from himself, and that he attains it so far as he casts out hell.<p>They said also that they picture to themselves wisdom as a palace, magnificent and highly adorned, the ascent to which is by twelve steps, and that no one reaches the first step unless from the Lord through conjunction with Him. Further, they said that everyone ascends according to the measure of the conjunction; and as he ascends he perceives that no one is wise from himself, but only from the Lord, and that the things in which he is wise, compared with those in which he is not wise, are as a few drops of water to a great lake. By the twelve steps leading to the palace of wisdom are signified principles of good conjoined to those of truth, and principles of truth conjoined to those of good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 36</h4><p>36. The wisdom that comes to perception is a perception of truth from an affection for it, especially a perception of spiritual truth. For there is civil truth, moral truth, and spiritual truth. Those who have a perception of spiritual truth from an affection for it have also a perception of moral and of civil truth; for of these perceptions the affection for spiritual truth is the soul. I have sometimes talked with angels about wisdom; and they said that wisdom is conjunction with the Lord, because the Lord is wisdom itself; and that he comes into that conjunction who casts out hell from himself, and comes into it to the extent that he casts out hell. They said that they represent wisdom to themselves as a palace, magnificent and highly adorned, the ascent to which is by twelve steps; and that only from the Lord through conjunction with Him can any one reach the first step; and he ascends in the measure of the conjunction; and as he ascends, he perceives that no one is wise from himself, but only from the Lord, and that the things in which a man is wise, compared with the things in which he is not wise, are as a few drops of water to a great lake. The twelve steps to the palace of wisdom signify goods conjoined with truths and truths conjoined with goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 36 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>36. Sapientia, quae ad perceptionem venit, est perceptio veri ex affectione ejus, imprimis perceptio veri spiritualis; nam est verum civile, verum morale, et verum spirituale; illi qui in perceptione veri spiritualis ex affectione ejus sunt, etiam in perceptione veri moralis et civilis sunt, nam affectio veri spiritualis est anima illarum. Loquutus sum quandoque cum Angelis de Sapientia, qui dixerunt, quod sapientia sit conjunctio cum Domino, quia Dominus est ipsa Sapientia, et quod in illam conjunctionem veniat, qui rejicit infernum a se, ac tantum in illam, quantum rejicit: dixerunt, quod sibi repraesentent Sapientiam sicut magnificum et ornatissimum Palatium, in quod ascenditur per duodecim gradus; et quod nemo ad primum gradum veniat, nisi a Domino per conjunctionem cum Ipso, et quod quisque ascendat secundum conjunctionem, et quod sicut ascendit percipiat, quod nemo sapiat a se, sed a Domino: tum quod illa quae sapit, respective ad illa quae non sapit, sint sicut aliquae guttae ad magnum lacum. Per duodecim gradus ad Palatium sapientiae significantur bona conjuncta veris et vera conjuncta bonis. </p>
