<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第45节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>45、由于主的圣治以一个来自人类的天堂为目的，故可推知，它以人类与祂自己的结合为目的<a href="28.htm">（参看28-31节）</a>。它还以人要与主结合得越来越紧密为目的<a href="33.htm">（参看32，33节）</a>，因为这样人就拥有更内在的天堂。此外，它以人要因着结合而变得更智慧<a href="34.htm">（参看34-36节）</a>、更幸福<a href="37.htm">（参看37-41节）</a>为目的，因为他通过并照着智慧拥有天堂，也通过智慧拥有幸福。最后，它以人要在自己看来，越明显是自己的主人，然而越清楚认识到他属于主为目的<a href="42.htm">（参看42-44节）</a>。所有这些事都属于主的圣治，因为所有这些事都构成天堂，天堂是它的目的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 45</h4><p>45. Since the Lord's Divine providence has as its end a heaven from the human race, it follows that it has as its end a conjunction of the human race with Him, as discussed in nos. <a href="28.htm">28-31</a>. Also, that it has as its end that a person be conjoined more and more closely with Him, as discussed in nos. <a href="32.htm">32-33</a>, for the person then has heaven in him more interiorly. So too, that Divine providence has as its end that a person through that conjunction become wiser, as discussed in nos. <a href="34.htm">34-36</a>, and that he become happier, as discussed in nos. <a href="37.htm">37-41</a>, because a person gains heaven as a result of wisdom and in accordance with it, and through it also happiness. And finally, that Divine Providence has as its end that a person appear to himself more and more distinctly to be his own person, and yet recognize more clearly that he is the Lord's, as discussed in nos. <a href="42.htm">42-44</a>. <p>All of these are objectives of the Lord's Divine providence, because they all constitute heaven, which it has as its end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 45</h4><p>45. Since the goal of the Lord's divine providence is a heaven from the human race, it follows that the goal is the union of the human race with the Lord (see <a href="28.htm">28-31</a>). It follows also that the goal is that we should be more closely united to him (<a href="32.htm">32-33</a>) and thereby be granted a more inward heaven. It also follows that the goal is for us to become wiser (<a href="34.htm">34-36</a>) and happier (<a href="37.htm">37-41</a>) because of this union, because we are given heaven through our wisdom and in proportion to it, and this is what gives us happiness. Lastly, it follows that the goal is for us to have a clearer sense of our identity and yet to be more clearly aware that we belong to the Lord (<a href="42.htm">42-44</a>). <p>All of these are part of the Lord's divine providence, because all of them are heaven, which is the goal. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 45</h4><p>45. As the Divine Providence of the Lord has for its end a heaven from the human race, it follows that it has for its end the conjunction of the human race with Himself; concerning this see n. <a href="28.htm">28-31</a>. It has also for its end that man should be more and more nearly conjoined to Him (see n. <a href="33.htm">33</a>), for thus man possesses heaven more interiorly. Further, it has for its end that man by this conjunction should become wiser (see n. <a href="34.htm">34-36</a>); and that he should become happier (see n. <a href="37.htm">37-41</a>), because it is from wisdom and according to it that man has heaven, and by means of wisdom has happiness also. Finally, it has for its end that man should appear more distinctly to himself to be master of himself, and yet to recognise more clearly that he is the Lord's (see n. <a href="42.htm">42-44</a>). All these things are of the Divine Providence of the Lord, because all these things constitute heaven, which it has for its end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 45</h4><p>45. As the end of the Lord's Divine providence is a heaven from the human race, it follows that its end is the conjunction of the human race with Himself (see <a href="28.htm">28-31</a>); also that its end is for man to be more and more nearly conjoined with Him (see <a href="32.htm">32-33</a>), for thus man possesses heaven more interiorly; also that its end is for man by that conjunction to become wiser (see <a href="34.htm">34-36</a>); also to become happier (see <a href="37.htm">37-41</a>), because it is from wisdom and according to it that man has heaven, and by means of it also has happiness; and finally, that its end is for man to appear to himself more distinctly to be his own, and yet to recognize more clearly that he is the Lord's (see <a href="42.htm">42-44</a>). All these things are of the Lord's Divine providence; for they all are heaven, which it has for its end. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 45 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>45. Quoniam Divina Providentia Domini pro fine habet coelum ex humano genere, sequitur quod pro fine habeat conjunctionem humani generis Secum, de qua <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_45/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_28">28-31</a>: tum, quod pro fine habeat, ut homo propius et proprius conjungatur Ipsi, de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_45/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_32">32-33</a>, sic enim ei coelum interius: ut et, quod <sup>1</sup>pro fine habeat, ut homo per conjunctionem illam fiat sapientior, de quo n. <sup>2</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_45/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_34">34-36</a>; et quod fiat felicior, de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_45/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_37">37-41</a>, quia coelum est homini <sup>3</sup>ex sapientia, et secundum illam; et per illam etiam felicitas: et demum <sup>4</sup>quod pro fine habeat ut homo distinctius appareat sibi sicut suus, et usque evidentius animadvertat quod sit Domini, de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_45/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_42">42-44</a>.
