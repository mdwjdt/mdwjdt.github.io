<h4 align="center"></h4><p>168、由于很少有人了解影响被主教导之人的理解力的光照，所以有必要说说它。来自主的光照有内在的和外在的；来自人的光照也有内在的和外在的。来自主的内在光照在于一个人一听见便发觉所说的话是否真实；外在光照则由此而出现在思维中。来自人的内在光照来自纯粹的确认，来自人的外在光照则来自纯粹的知识。有必要说一说它们各自的情况。<p>理性人凭来自主的内在光照，一听说许多事，就立刻发觉它们是否真实。例如，爱是信的生命，也就是说，信从爱获得其生命。凭内在光照，人们发觉，一个人会意愿他所爱的，行他所意愿的，这意味着爱就是行。他们还发觉，一个人也会意愿并行出他出于爱所信的，这意味着信也是行。他们又发觉，恶人不可能拥有对神的爱，或对神的信。凭内在光照，理性人一听说神为一；祂是全在；一切良善皆来自祂；一切事物都与良善和真理有关；一切良善皆来自良善本身，一切真理皆来自真理本身，也会发觉一些事。当人听说这些事和其它类似的事时，就在内心深处发觉它们；他拥有这种感觉，是因为他拥有理性，并且这理性就在光照它的天堂之光中。<p>外在光照是来自内在光照的思维的一种光照；思维处于这种光照，会到它保持它从内在光照中所获得的那种感觉，以及它拥有真理和良善的知识的程度，因为它从这些东西中提取支持它的理性。来自这种外在光照的思维从两边看东西；它一边看支持它的理性，一边看驳倒它的表象或幻觉；它驱散后者，收集前者。<p>来自人的内在光照则完全不同。在这种光中，人从一边，而不从另一边看东西；一旦下定决心，他就在一种光中看东西，这光看似前面所说的光，但它是一种冬光。以由于贿赂和利益而判案不公的法官为例。一旦通过法律和论据将他们的判决合理化，他们在这判决中就只看见公义。事实上，他们可能看到某种不公，但他们不想看见它，所以就掩盖问题，使自己瞎眼，从而不再看见它。这同样适用于在判决中受友情，或得宠的渴望，或关系纽带影响的法官。<p>这种人以同样的方式对待他们从权威人士或名人嘴里所听来的一切，或他们从自己的聪明中所孵化出来的一切。他们是盲目的理性者，因为他们的视觉来自他们所确认的虚假；虚假关闭视觉，而真理却打开视觉。这些人从真理之光看不见任何真理，从对公义的爱看不见任何公义，只从确认之光，也就是一种幻光去看东西。在灵界，他们看上去就像没有头的脸，或脸类似后面是木头脑袋的人脸；他们被称为理性动物，因为他们的理性只是潜在的。那些出于刻在记忆上的纯知识思考和谈论的人，就具有来自人的外在光照；这些人几乎没有能力从自己确认任何东西。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 168</h4><p>168. Since few people know anything about the enlightenment possessed by the intellect of a person who is taught by the Lord, we must therefore say something about it. <p>An interior and an exterior enlightenment by the Lord is possible, and also is an interior and an exterior enlightenment by man. It is an interior enlightenment by the Lord that enables a person to perceive at first hearing whether a statement is true or not. An exterior enlightenment is the result of this in his consequent thought. An interior enlightenment by man is the result of mere justification. And an exterior enlightenment by man comes from the simple possession of knowledge. But we will say something about each of these.</p><p>[2] An interior enlightenment by the Lord enables a rational person to perceive immediately, as soon as he hears them, a variety of things as being true or not true. Take, for example, this statement, that love is the life of faith, or that faith has its life from love. An interior enlightenment enables the person to perceive as well the following, that whatever a person loves he wills, and what he wills he does, and therefore that to love is to do. So, too, the following, that whatever a person is moved by love to believe he also wills and does, and therefore that to have faith is also to do. And further, that as an impious person cannot love God, so neither can he have faith in God. <p>A rational person is also enabled by an interior enlightenment to immediately perceive, when he hears them, the following: that God is one; that He is omnipresent; that all good comes from Him; that all things, moreover, have some relation to goodness and truth; and that all good comes from goodness itself, and all truth from truth itself. <p>These and other like statements are things that the person interiorly perceives in himself when he hears them. He perceives them because he has rationality, and this in the light of heaven by which it is enlightened.</p><p>[3] An exterior enlightenment by the Lord is an enlightenment of the thought resulting from that interior enlightenment; and the thought continues in that enlightenment as long as it retains the perception that it has from the interior enlightenment, and to the extent that it possesses at the same time concepts of truth and good. For it takes from these concepts rational considerations by which it forms confirmations. <p>Thought from this exterior enlightenment sees a thing from two sides. On one side it sees reasons that confirm it. On the other it sees appearances that dispute it. The latter it dispels. The former it gathers.</p><p>[4] An interior enlightenment by man, on the other hand, is quite different. A person possessing this state of enlightenment sees a thing from one side and not from the other; and when he has affirmed it, he sees it in a light seemingly like the light described above, but it is a wintry light. <p>Consider for example the following: A judge who judges unjustly in return for gifts or for material gain, after he has defended his decision by the laws and by arguments, does not see anything but justice in his decision. Some do see the injustice; but because they do not wish to see it, they blur it and blind themselves to it, so that they do not see it. <p>It is the same with a judge who renders his decisions out of partiality, or to gain favor, or to be allied with his relatives.</p><p>[5] For people like that it is the same with everything that they take from the mouth of a man of authority or from the mouth of a celebrity, or hatch from their own intelligence. They are rationally blind, for their sight comes from the falsities they defend, and falsity closes up the sight, as truth opens it. <p>Such people do not see any truth by the light of truth, nor any justice from a love of justice, but see by the light of justification, which is an illusory light. In the spiritual world they appear as faces without a head, or as human-like faces with wooden heads behind; and they are called rational cattle, because they have the potential of rationality. <p>An exterior enlightenment by man, however, exists in people who think and speak solely in accordance with knowledge impressed on their memory. Of themselves they are scarcely able to verify anything. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 168</h4><p>168. Since there are not many people who know anything about the enlightenment that envelops the discernment of people who are being led by the Lord, I need to say something about that. <p>There is inner and outer enlightenment from the Lord and inner and outer enlightenment from ourselves. The inner enlightenment from the Lord is our sensing on first hearing whether what someone is telling us is true or not. The outer enlightenment occurs in the thinking we do on that basis. The inner enlightenment from ourselves comes strictly from our own convictions, and the outer enlightenment from ourselves comes simply from the information we possess. But let me offer some detail.</p><p>[2] People who are rational because of an inner enlightenment from the Lord sense instantly, the moment they hear, whether most things are true or not. They know, for example, that love is the life of faith or that faith gets its life from love. It is from inner enlightenment that people sense that we intend what we love, and do what we intend, which means that loving is doing. They sense that what we believe because of our love we also intend and do, which means that having faith is also doing. They sense that irreverent people cannot have a love for God or faith in God. <p>People who are rational because of their inner enlightenment also sense certain things the moment they hear that God is one--they sense that God is omnipresent, that everything good comes from him, that everything goes back to what is good and what is true, and that everything good comes from goodness itself and everything true from truth itself. We sense these things, and others like them, deep within ourselves when we hear them; and we have this sensitivity because we have rationality, and because it is in a light of heaven that enlightens it.</p><p>[3] Outer enlightenment is enlightenment of our thinking because of that inner enlightenment, and our thinking enjoys this enlightenment to the extent that it retains the sense granted by that inner enlightenment and also knows from experience what is true and good. It picks up from these the reasons that support it. Thinking from this kind of outer enlightenment sees things from both sides. On the one side such thinking sees the reasons that support it, and on the other side it sees the illusions that undermine it. It dismisses the latter and gathers in the former.</p><p>[4] Inner enlightenment from ourselves, though, is totally different. In this light, we see things from one side and not from the other, and once we have made up our minds, we see things in a light that looks like the light we have been talking about, but it is a wintry light. Take, for example, judges who make unjust decisions for bribes or for profit. Once they have rationalized their decisions by laws and arguments, it looks to them as though they have been fair in their decisions. They may actually see some unfairness, but since they do not want to see it, they veil it over and blind themselves so completely that they no longer see it. It is the same with judges who make decisions on the basis of friendship, to curry favor, or because of close family relationships. <p>Much the same holds for anything that such people accept on the word of someone in authority or someone famous, or for anything they construct out of their own intellects. These are blind reasons because the distortions that convince them are the basis of their sight, and distortion closes sight, while truth opens it.</p><p>[5] People like this see nothing true in the light of truth and nothing fair from a love of fairness. They see from the light of their own convictions, which is a feeble light. In the spiritual world they look like faces without a head or like humanoid faces on heads of wood; and they are called rational sheep because potentially they do have rationality. <p>Outer enlightenment from ourselves, though, is characteristic of people who do their thinking and talking solely on the basis of information stamped on their memories. They are scarcely capable of coming to any conclusions on their own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 168</h4><p>168. As few know anything about the enlightenment which affects the understanding of a man who is taught by the Lord, something will now be said about it. There is an interior and an exterior enlightenment from the Lord; and there is an interior and an exterior enlightenment from man. Interior enlightenment from the Lord consists in a man's perceiving at first hearing whether what is said is true or not true; and exterior enlightenment is derived from this in the thought. Interior enlightenment from man is from confirmation alone; and exterior enlightenment from man is from knowledge alone. Something will now be said about each of these.</p><p>[2] A rational man by interior enlightenment from the Lord at once perceives, when he hears them, whether many things are true or not; as, for example, that love is the life of faith, that is, that faith lives from love. By interior enlightenment a man also perceives that what a man loves he wills, and what he wills he does, and consequently that to love is to do; and again, that whatever a man believes from love, this he also wills and does, and consequently that to have faith is also to do; and also that an irreligious man cannot have love to God, and so cannot have faith in God. By interior enlightenment also a rational man perceives the following truths as soon as he hears them: that God is One; that He is omnipresent; that all good is from Him; also that all things have relation to good and truth; and that all good is from Good itself and all truth from Truth itself. These and other similar truths a man perceives interiorly within himself when he hears them; and he has this perception because he has rationality, and this in the light of heaven is what enlightens.</p><p>[3] Exterior enlightenment is enlightenment of thought derived from this interior enlightenment; and thought is in this enlightenment so far as it remains in the perception that it has from interior enlightenment and also so far as it has knowledges of truth and good, for from these it draws reasons for confirmation. Thought from this exterior enlightenment sees a matter on both sides; on the one it sees reasons which confirm it, and on the other appearances which invalidate it; the latter it dispels and the former it stores up.</p><p>[4] Interior enlightenment from man, however, is wholly different. By it a man sees a matter on one side and not on the other; and when he has confirmed it he sees it in a light similar in appearance to the light treated of above, but it is the light of winter. For example, a judge who judges unjustly because of bribes and for the sake of gain, when he has confirmed his decision by the laws and by reasons, sees in his judgment nothing but what is just. Some, indeed, see the injustice, but as they do not wish to see it, they darken the issue and blind themselves, and so do not see it. It is the same in the case of a judge whose decisions are influenced by friendship, by the desire to gain favour, and by the ties of relationship.</p><p>[5] In similar fashion such persons treat everything that they receive from the mouth of a man in authority or a man of celebrity, or that they have hatched out from their own intelligence. They are blind reasoners; for their sight is from falsities, which they confirm; and falsity closes the sight, while truth opens it. Such persons do not see any truth from the light of truth, or any justice from a love of what is just, but only from the light of confirmation, which is a delusive light. In the spiritual world these appear like faces with no head, or like faces that resemble human faces with heads of wood behind them; and they are called rational animals, because their rationality is merely potential. Exterior enlightenment from man is possessed by those who think and speak from mere knowledge impressed upon the memory; and these have but little ability to confirm anything from themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 168</h4><p>168. As few know anything about the enlightenment that the understanding of a man who is taught by the Lord is in, something shall be said about it. There is an interior and an exterior enlightenment from the Lord; and there is an interior and an exterior enlightenment from man. By interior enlightenment from the Lord a man perceives at the first hearing whether what is said is true or is not true. Exterior enlightenment is from this in the thought. Interior enlightenment from man is from mere confirmation; and exterior enlightenment from man is from mere knowledge. About each one of these something shall be said.</p><p>[2] A man who is rational from interior enlightenment from the Lord immediately perceives, when he hears them, whether many things are true or not true; for example, that love is the life of faith, that is, that faith lives from love. Also by interior enlightenment man perceives that whatever one loves he wills, and what he wills he does, consequently that to love is to do; and again, that whatever man believes from love, this too he wills and does, consequently to have faith is to do; also that a wicked man cannot have love of God, thus neither faith in God. By interior enlightenment a rational man perceives as soon as he hears it that God is One; that He is omnipresent; that all good is from Him; also that all things have relation to good and truth; and that all good is from Good itself, and all truth from Truth itself. Man perceives these things and other like things interiorly in himself when he hears them; and he has this perception because he has rationality that is in the light of heaven, which gives enlightenment.</p><p>[3] Exterior enlightenment is an enlightenment of the thought that is from the interior enlightenment; and the thought is in such enlightenment so far as it continues in the perception that it has from interior enlightenment, and also so far as it has knowledges of truth and good; for from these it draws the reasons by means of which it confirms. Thought from this exterior enlightenment sees a thing from both sides; on the one it sees the reasons that confirm, on the other the appearances that invalidate; the latter it disperses, the former it collects.</p><p>[4] Interior enlightenment from man is wholly different. By it man sees a subject on one side and not on the other; and when he has confirmed it he sees it in a light apparently like the light spoken of above, but it is a winter light. For example, a judge who judges unjustly because of gifts or for the sake of gain, when he has confirmed his decision by the laws and by reasons, sees nothing but justice in it. To some the injustice may be evident, but as they do not wish to see it they mystify and blind themselves, and thus do not see. The same is true of a judge who is influenced in his decisions by friendship, or by a desire to gain favor, or by the ties of relationship.</p><p>[5] Such men regard in the same way every thing that they hear from the lips of a man in authority, or a man of celebrity, or that they have hatched out from their own intelligence. They are rationally blind; for they have their vision from falsities, which they confirm; and falsity closes the sight, while truth opens it. Such see no truth from the light of truth, and no justice from a love of justice, but only from the light of confirmation, which is a delusive light. In the spiritual world they appear like faces without heads, or like faces that resemble human faces behind which there are wooden heads; and they are called rational animals, because they have rationality potentially. Those have exterior enlightenment from man, who think and talk from mere knowledge impressed on the memory. Such are scarcely able to confirm any thing from themselves. </p>

Quoniam pauci sciunt aliquid de Illustratione, in qua intellectus hominis est qui docetur a Domino, ideo de illa aliquid dicetur. Est illustratio a Domino interior et exterior, et est illustratio ab homine etiam interior et exterior: illustratio interior a Domino est, quod homo ex prima auditione percipiat num verum sit vel non verum quod dicitur; illustratio exterior est inde in cogitatione: illustratio interior ab homine, est ex sola confirmatione; et illustratio exterior ab homine est ex sola scientia: sed de singulis aliquid.</p><p>[2] Homo rationalis ex interiori Illustratione a Domino illico percipit, cum audit, plura num vera sunt vel non vera: sint pro exemplo haec: Quod amor sit vita fidei, seu quod fides vivat ex amore: homo ex interiore illustratione etiam percipit hoc, quod quicquid homo amat, id velit, et quod vult id faciat, et inde quod amare sit facere: tum etiam hoc, quod quicquid homo ex amore credit, hoc quoque velit et faciat, et inde quod fidem habere etiam sit facere: ut et, quod impius non possit amorem Dei, ita nec fidem Dei habere. Homo rationalis ex illustratione interiore etiam illico cum audit, percipit haec; Quod Deus unus sit; Quod Ille sit Omnipraesens: Quod omne bonum ab Ipso sit: tum, Quod omnia se referant ad bonum et verum; et quod omne bonum sit ab Ipso Bono, et omne verum sit ab Ipso Vero. Haec et similia alia percipit homo interius in se, cum audit; quod percipiat, est quia ei rationalitas est, et haec in luce coeli quae illustrat.</p><p>[3] Illustratio exterior [a Domino] est illustratio cogitationis ex illustratione illa interiore, et cogitatio tantum in illa illustratione est, quantum manet in perceptione quae illi est ex illustratione interiore, et simul quantum ei sunt cognitiones veri et boni, ex his enim sumit rationes, per quas confirmat. Cogitatio ex illustratione hac exteriore videt rem ab utraque parte; ab una videt rationes quae confirmant, ab altera videt apparentias quae infirmant; has discutit, illas colligit.</p><p>[4] Illustratio autem interior ab homine <sup>1</sup>est prorsus alia; homo ab hac videt rem ab una parte et non ab altera, et cum illam confirmavit, videt illam in luce simili quoad apparentiam luci, de qua supra, sed est lux hyemalis: sit pro exemplo hoc: judex qui ex donis et propter lucrum injuste judicat, postquam confirmavit judicium per leges et per rationes, non videt aliter quam justum in suo judicio; quidam vident injustum, sed quia id non volunt videre, obscurant et occaecant se, et sic non vident: simile est cum judice qui ex amicitia, ex captanda gratia, exque conjunctione per affinitates, judicia fert.</p><p>[5] Simile est talibus cum omni re quam ex ore viri auctoritatis, aut ex ore viri famae hauriunt, aut ex propria intelligentia excluserunt: sunt rationales caeci, nam ex falsis, quae confirmant, est illis visus, ac falsum occludit, et verum aperit illum. Tales non vident ullum verum ex luce veri, nec ullum justum ex amore justi, sed ex luce confirmationis, quae est lux fatua; apparent in Mundo spirituali sicut facies absque capite, aut sicut facies similes faciebus humanis post quas sunt capita lignea, et vocantur <sup>2</sup>pecudes rationales, quia eis rationalitas est in potentia. Illustratio autem exterior ab homine <sup>3</sup>est apud illos qui ex sola scientia impressa memoriae <sup>4</sup>cogitant et loquuntur; hi ex se parum possunt aliquam rem confirmare.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: homine,<p>2 Prima editio: vocantut<p>3 Prima editio: homine,<p>4 Prima editio: memotiae </p>
