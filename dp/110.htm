<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>110、但在那些处于天堂之爱的人里面，当他们说话时，其思维的内在和外在，或内在人和外在人便合而为一；他们也不知道两者之间有什么区别。他们的生命之爱及其对良善的情感和对真理的感知，在他们所思想的事，以及他们由此所说和所做的事里面，就像灵魂。他们若是牧师，就会出于对邻之爱和对主之爱传道；若是法官，就会基于真正的公正判案；若是商人，就会出于真正的诚实行事；若是已婚者，就会出于真正的贞洁来爱他们的妻子，等等。他们的生命之爱也有作为其副手的对方法的爱，它教导并引导这副手谨慎行事，给它穿上既热心教义真理，也热心生活良善的衣裳。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 110</h4><p>110. In the case of people governed by a heavenly love, their internal and external levels of thought, or their internal and external selves, are united when they speak, and they do not know the difference. Their life's love with its affections for good and their accompanying perceptions of truth is the soul, so to speak, in what they think and consequently speak and do. If they are priests, they preach from a love for the neighbor and love toward the Lord. If they are judges, they judge in accordance with real justice. If they are businessmen, they conduct their dealings with real honesty. If they are married men, they love their married partners with real chastity. And so on. <p>Their life's love also has a love of the means as its deputy, which it instructs and directs to act with prudence, and it clothes it with the garments of a zeal both for the truths of doctrine and for goods of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 110</h4><p>110. In people who are being led by heavenly love, the inner and outer processes of their thinking, their inner and outer selves, are acting in unison when they talk. There is no awareness of any distinction between them. Their life's love, together with its desires for what is good and their perceptions of what is true, is like the soul within the things they are thinking and the things they say and do as a result. If they are priests, then they preach out of their love for their neighbor and their love for the Lord. If they are judges, then they make decisions on the basis of true justice. If they are merchants, then they act out of real honesty. If they are married, then they love their spouses with real chastity; and the list could go on. <p>Their life's love also has a love of means as its agent, an agent whom it teaches and guides to act thoughtfully, clothing it with robes of a passion for both theological truth and good deeds of daily life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 110</h4><p>110. With those, however, who are in heavenly love the internal and the external of thought, or the internal and the external man, act as one when they speak, nor do they know any difference between them. Their life's love with its affections of good and their perceptions of truth is like a soul in whatever they think, and consequently say and do. If they are priests they preach from love towards the neighbour and love to the Lord; if judges they judge from justice itself; if merchants they trade from sincerity itself; if married they love their wives from chastity itself; and so on. The life's love of such also has the love of means as its deputy, which it teaches and leads to act from prudence, and which it clothes with the garments of zeal for the truths of doctrine and also for the goods of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 110</h4><p>110. But in those who are in heavenly love the internal and the external of thought, or the internal and the external man, make one when they speak; nor do such know any difference between these. Their life's love, with its affections for good and the perceptions for truth belonging thereto, is like a soul in their thoughts, and in what they speak and do from them. If they are priests they preach from love towards the neighbor and from love to the Lord; if judges they judge from genuine justice; if merchants they act from genuine sincerity; if married they love their wives from genuine chastity; and so on. The life's love of such has also its love of means as its vicar, which it teaches and leads to act from prudence, and clothes with garments of zeal both for truths of doctrine and for goods of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 110 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>110. Apud illos autem qui in Amore coelesti sunt, Internum et Externum cogitationis, seu Internus et Externus homo, unum agunt, cum loquuntur, nec sciunt discrimen; amor vitae <sup>1</sup>illorum cum ejus affectionibus boni et harum perceptionibus veri, est sicut anima in illis quae cogitant, et inde loquuntur et agunt; si sacerdotes sunt, ex amore erga proximum et ex amore <sup>2</sup>in Dominum praedicant; si judices sunt ex ipsa justitia judicant; si negotiatores sunt, ex ipsa sinceritate agunt; si uxorati, ex ipsa castitate amant conjugem, et sic porro. Amor vitae illorum etiam Amorem mediorum ut Vicarium habet, quem docet et ducit ut ex prudentia agat, et amicit illum vestibus zeli pro veris doctrinae et simul pro bonis vitae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: virae<p>2 Prima editio: amote </p>
