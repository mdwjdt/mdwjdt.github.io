<h4 align="center"></h4><p>184、这同样适用于人因遗传所具有的其它邪恶，如奸淫、欺诈、报复、亵渎等等。这些邪恶无一能被移走，除非思考并意愿它们的自由留给人，并且他能貌似凭自己移走它们。然而，他只有通过承认圣治，并乞求它作工除去邪恶，才能做到这一切。如果没有这种自由和圣治，这些邪恶就像封存在里面，没有清除的毒素，很快就会蔓延，并给整个系统带来死亡；它们也像心脏本身的疾病，能使整个身体很快死亡。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 184</h4><p>184. It is the same with any other evil to which a person is impelled by heredity, such as adulterous affairs, fraudulent practices, acts of vengeance, blasphemies, and other like evils. None of these can be expelled except by leaving to the person the freedom to think and will them, and by the person's thus rejecting them as though of himself - something which, even then, he cannot do unless he acknowledges Divine providence and begs to have it accomplish it. <p>Without that freedom and at the same time Divine providence, those evils would be like poison shut in and not drawn out, which would soon spread and cause the whole to die. Or they would be like a disease of the heart itself, because of which the entire body shortly dies. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 184</h4><p>184. It is the same with any other of the evils we have by heredity--with adultery, for example, and with fraud, vengeance, blasphemy, and the like. None of these can be expelled unless our freedom to consider and intend them is preserved and we use what seems to be our own autonomy to expel them from ourselves in this way. We cannot do this unless we acknowledge divine providence and pray that the evils be expelled through providence. If it were not for this freedom and for divine providence, the evils would be like poison closed in and not excreted, which soon spreads and brings death everywhere, or like a disease of the heart itself that soon proves fatal to the whole body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 184</h4><p>184. The same course is followed with other evils in which man is from heredity, such as adulteries, frauds, revenge, blasphemy, and others of a like nature; and none of these could be removed unless the liberty to think and will them were left to man and he from this liberty removed them as of himself. Yet this he cannot do unless he acknowledges the Divine Providence and implores that the work may be done by it. Without this liberty and at the same time the Divine Providence those evils would be like poison kept in and not expelled, which would quickly spread and bring death to the whole system; or they would be like a disease of the heart itself from which the whole body soon dies. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 184</h4><p>184. The same is true of other evils that man is in by inheritance, such as adulteries, frauds, revenge, blasphemy, and others like these. None of these could be put away unless a liberty to think and will them were left to man, that so he might put them away as if of himself; and yet he can do this only by acknowledging the Divine providence and praying that the work may be done by it. Except for that liberty, combined with the Divine providence, such evils would be like poison kept in and not expelled, which would soon spread and carry death to the whole system; or they would be like a disease of the heart itself, from which the whole body soon dies. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 184 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>184. Similiter fit cum alio malo, in quo homo ex haereditario est, ut cum adulteriis, defraudationibus, vindictis, blasphemationibus, et similibus aliis, quae omnia non possunt removeri aliter, quam ut libertas cogitandi et volendi illa relicta sit, et quod sic homo sicut a se removeret illa, quod tamen non potest, nisi agnoscat Divinam Providentiam, et imploret ut per illam fiat: absque libertate illa et simul Divina Providentia forent mala illa similia veneno <sup>1</sup>incluso et non egesto, quod brevi se circumspargeret et morti daret omnia; et similia forent morbo ipsius cordis, ex quo totum corpus brevi emoritur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: venemo </p>
