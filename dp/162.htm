<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第162节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>162、⑵人唯独被主通过并从天使天堂引领和教导。我说过，人被主通过并从天使天堂引领。然而，他通过天使天堂被引领只是表象，他从该天堂被引领才是真相。他通过天使天堂被引领之所以是一种表象，是因为主显为在那天堂之上的一轮太阳。他从那天堂被引领之所以是真相，是因为主在那天堂里面，如同灵魂在人里面。因为如前所示，主是全在，不在空间之中；因此，距离是取决于与主的结合的一种表象；结合则取决于对来自主的爱与智慧的接受。此外，由于没有人与如在自己里面那样的主结合，所以主从远处向天使显为一轮太阳。然而，祂却在整个天使天堂里面，就像灵魂在人里面。祂以同样的方式在每个天堂社群里面，也在那里的每位天使里面。因为人的灵魂不仅是整体的灵魂，也是每个部分的灵魂。<p>然而，由于表面上看，主似乎从来自祂并围绕祂的太阳（关于这个太阳，可参看《圣爱与圣智》一书的第二部分）掌管整个天堂，并通过它掌管世界，还由于每个人都被允许根据表象说话，他也只能这样做，所以凡不在智慧本身中的人都被允许认为，主从祂的太阳掌管一切，还被允许认为，祂通过天使天堂掌管世界。此外，低层天堂的天使根据这种表象思考；而高层天堂的天使虽根据这种表象说话，却根据真相思考，这真相是：主从来自祂自己的天使天堂掌管宇宙。<p>简单人和智慧人的言谈很相似，思维却不同，这一点可通过我们世界的太阳来说明。这两种人都照着表象说，太阳东升西落；虽然智慧人也这样说，但他们想的却是，太阳是静止不动的；这一个才是真相，而那一个只是表象。我也可以用看似在灵界中的事物来说明这一点；因为那里也有空间和距离，跟自然界一样；然而，它们实际上是表象，这些表象反映了情感和由此而来的思维的不同。这同样适用于主在其太阳中的表象。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 162</h4><p>162. (2) A person is led and taught by the Lord alone through the angelic heaven and from it. We say that a person is led by the Lord through the angelic heaven and from it, but his being led through the angelic heaven is an appearance, while his being led from that heaven is the reality. <p>It appears that a person is led through the angelic heaven because the Lord appears above that heaven as the sun. In reality he is led from that heaven, because the Lord is present in that heaven like the soul in a person. For the Lord is omnipresent, and does not exist in space, as we have shown before. Consequently any distance from Him is an appearance according to one's conjunction with Him, and any conjunction accords with one's reception of love and wisdom from Him. <p>So, because no one can be conjoined with the Lord as He is in Himself, therefore He appears to angels at a distance as the sun. But still He is present throughout the entire angelic heaven like the soul in a person, as He is also in every single society in heaven and in every single angel there. For a person's soul is not only the soul of the whole, but also the soul in every part.</p><p>[2] However, because it appears that the Lord governs the whole of heaven, and through it the world, from the sun which originates from Him and in which He is (regarding which sun, see our treatise Divine Love and Wisdom, Part Two), and because it is granted everyone to speak in accordance with the appearance, nor can it be otherwise, therefore to everyone lacking real wisdom it is also granted to think that the Lord governs each and every thing from His sun, and also that He governs the world through the angelic heaven. It is in accordance with this appearance, too, that angels of the lower heavens think. But though angels of the higher heavens speak, indeed, in accordance with the appearance, they think in accordance with the reality, which is that the Lord governs the universe from the angelic heaven, which is from Him.</p><p>[3] The simple and the wise speak alike, but they do not think alike, and we can illustrate this by reference to the world's sun. All speak of it in accordance with the appearance, saying, for example, that it rises and sets. But although the wise speak in the same way, still they think that the sun stands still. This, too, is the reality, and the other the appearance. <p>The same point may be illustrated by appearances in the spiritual world; for intervals of space and distance there appear as they do in the natural world, but still are appearances that accord with the inhabitants' dissimilarity of affections and consequent thoughts. <p>It is the same with the appearance of the Lord in His sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 162</h4><p>162. 2. We are led and taught by the Lord alone through and from the angelic heaven. The statement is that we are led by the Lord through and from the angelic heaven. However, it is an appearance only that we are led through the angelic heaven, the truth being that we are led from it. The reason for the appearance that it is through the angelic heaven is that the Lord is seen as a sun above that heaven. The truth that it is from heaven is because the Lord is in heaven the way our soul is in us. The Lord is omnipresent and not in space, as already noted, so distance is an appearance that depends on union with him, and union depends on acceptance of love and wisdom from him. Further, since no one can be united to the Lord as he is in himself, he appears like the sun to angels at a distance. Still, he is in the whole angelic heaven the way our soul is in us, in every community of heaven in the same way, and likewise in every individual angel there. Our soul is not just the soul of our whole being but the soul of every part of us.</p><p>[2] However, since it does seem as though the Lord were governing the whole heaven, and through it, the world, from the sun that comes from him and surrounds him (on this sun, see part 2 of Divine Love and Wisdom), and since there is nothing wrong with talking in terms of appearances (that is actually the only way we can talk), there is nothing wrong for anyone who does not have actual wisdom in thinking that the Lord is governing all this from his sun and that he is governing our world through the angelic heaven. Angels of the lower heavens think in terms of this appearance, while angels of the higher heavens talk in the same terms but think in terms of the truth, namely, that the Lord governs the universe from the angelic heaven that comes from his very self.</p><p>[3] The sun of our own world may serve to illustrate how simple and wise individuals talk similarly but do not think similarly. Both talk as though the sun rose and set; but even though wise people talk that way, they are aware in their thought that it stands immobile. This is the truth; the other is the appearance. <p>We might illustrate the same point with the way things seem in the spiritual world. There seem to be space and distance there just as there are in our physical world, but these are actually appearances that reflect differences in feelings and therefore in thoughts. This is like the Lord seeming to be in his sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 162</h4><p>162. II. MAN IS LED AND TAUGHT BY THE LORD ALONE THROUGH THE ANGELIC HEAVEN AND FROM IT. It is said that man is led by the Lord through [i.e., by means of, per] the angelic heaven and from it; but it is only an appearance that he is led through the angelic heaven while it is the truth that he is led from that heaven. The appearance that he is led through the angelic heaven arises from the fact that the Lord appears over that heaven as the Sun; but the truth that man is led from that heaven arises from the fact that the Lord is in that heaven as the soul is in man. For the Lord is omnipresent, and is not in space, as was shown above; and therefore distance is an appearance according to conjunction with the Lord, conjunction being according to the reception of love and wisdom from Him; and since no one can be conjoined to the Lord as He is in Himself, He appears to the angels at a distance as a Sun; nevertheless, He is in the whole angelic heaven, as the soul is in man. In like manner He is in every society of heaven and also in every angel there; for a man's soul is not only the soul of the whole man but also the soul of every part.</p><p>[2] But since it is according to the appearance that the Lord rules the universal heaven and through it the world from the Sun which is from Him and in which He is (concerning which Sun see the treatise THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, Second Part), and since everyone is permitted to speak from the appearance, nor can he do otherwise, therefore everyone who is not in wisdom itself is permitted to think that the Lord rules all things in general and in particular from His Sun; and also that He rules the world through the angelic heaven. From this appearance also the angels of the lower heavens think; but the angels of the higher heavens speak indeed from the appearance but they think from the truth, which is, that the Lord rules the universe from the angelic heaven, that is, from Himself.</p><p>[3] That the simple and the wise speak alike but do not think alike, may be illustrated from the sun of the world. All speak about it according to the appearance, saying that it rises and sets; but the wise, although they speak in the same way, nevertheless think of it as standing still, which also is the truth while the other is the appearance. The same may also be illustrated from appearances in the spiritual world; for there spaces and distances appear as in the natural world; but yet they are appearances according to the dissimilarity of affections and of thoughts therefrom. It is the same with the appearance of the Lord in His Sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 162</h4><p>162. (2) Man is led and taught by the Lord alone through the angelic heaven and from it. It is said that man is led by the Lord through and from the angelic heaven; that he is led through the angelic heaven is an appearance; that he is led from that heaven is the truth. That he is led through the angelic heaven is an appearance from the Lord's appearing above that heaven as a sun; that he is led from that heaven is the truth, because the Lord is in that heaven as the soul is in man. For the Lord is omnipresent, and is not in space, as has been shown above; consequently distance is an appearance according to conjunction with the Lord; and conjunction is according to the reception of love and wisdom from the Lord. And as no one can be conjoined with the Lord as He is in Himself, He appears to angels at a distance like a sun; nevertheless He is in the whole angelic heaven, like the soul in man. He is in like manner in every society of heaven, and in every angel therein; for a man's soul is both the soul of the whole and also the soul of every part.</p><p>[2] But because of the appearance that the Lord rules the whole heaven, and through it the world, from the sun that is from Him and in which He is (respecting which sun see Part Second of the work on The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom), and because every man is permitted to speak from appearance, nor can he do otherwise, so any one who is not in wisdom itself is permitted to think that the Lord rules each thing and all things from His sun; and also that He rules the world through the angelic heaven. From that appearance, moreover, the angels of the lower heavens think; but the angels of the higher heavens, while they speak from appearance, think from the truth, which is that the Lord rules the universe from the angelic heaven, which is from Himself.</p><p>[3] That the simple and the wise speak alike but do not think alike, may be illustrated by the sun of the world, about which all speak according to appearance, saying that it rises and sets; but while those who are wise use the same language they think of the sun as standing unmoved, which is the truth, while the other is the appearance. Illustrations of this may also be found in the appearances in the spiritual world; for spaces and distances appear there as in the natural world; nevertheless they are appearances that are in accord with the dissimilarity of affections and of thoughts therefrom. The same is true of the Lord's appearance in His sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 162 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>162. II. Quod homo <sup>1</sup>a solo Domino ducatur et doceatur per Coelum angelicum et ex illo; dicitur quod homo a Domino ducatur per Coelum Angelicum, et ex illo; sed quod per Coelum angelicum, est ex apparentia, at quod ex coelo illo, est ex veritate: quod apparentia sit quod per Coelum Angelicum, est quia Dominus apparet supra illud Coelum ut Sol: quod veritas sit, quod ex Coelo illo, est quia Dominus in illo Coelo est sicut anima in homine: Dominus enim est Omnipraesens, et non est in spatio, ut prius ostensum est, quare distantia [ab Ipso] est apparentia secundum conjunctionem cum Ipso, et conjunctio est secundum receptionem amoris et sapientiae ab Ipso: et quia nemo potest conjungi <sup>2</sup>Domino, quemadmodum Ipse est in Se, ideo Ipse apparet Angelis ad distantiam sicut Sol: sed usque <sup>3</sup>est in universo Coelo angelico sicut anima in homine; et similiter in unaquavis Societate Coeli, et similiter in unoquovis Angelo ibi; anima enim hominis non modo est anima totius, sed etiam cujus vis partis.</p><p>[2] Sed quia ex apparentia est quod Dominus regat universum Coelum, et per hoc mundum, a Sole qui ab Ipso, et ubi Ipse, de quo Sole videatur Transactio DE DIVINO AMORE <sup>4</sup>ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA, in Parte Secunda, et quia licet cuivis homini loqui ex apparentia, nec potest aliter, ideo etiam licet cuivis, <sup>5</sup>qui non in ipsa sapientia est, cogitare, quod Dominus regat omnia et singula ex Sole suo, et quoque quod regat Mundum per Coelum Angelicum; ex tali apparentia etiam cogitant angeli inferiorum Coelorum; at Angeli superiorum Coelorum loquuntur quidem ex apparentia, sed cogitant ex veritate, quae est quod Dominus regat universum ex Coelo Angelico, quod est ex Se Ipso.</p><p>[3] Quod simplices et sapientes similiter loquantur, sed non similiter cogitent, illustrari potest ex Sole mundi; de illo omnes loquuntur ex apparentia, ut quod oriatur et occidat, at sapientes, tametsi loquuntur similiter, usque cogitant quod immotus stet; hoc quoque est veritas, et illud apparentia. Idem etiam illustrari potest ex apparentiis in Mundo spirituali, apparent enim ibi spatia et distantiae sicut in Mundo naturali, sed usque illa sunt apparentiae secundum dissimilitudinem affectionum et inde cogitationum. Simile est cum apparentia Domini in Sole suo.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: bomo<p>2 Prima editio: canjungi<p>3 Prima editio: usque<p>4 Prima editio: AOMRE<p>5 Prima editio: cuiuis, </p>
