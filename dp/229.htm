<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第229节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>229、⑶亵渎圣物的种类有很多，但这种是最糟糕的。从最一般意义上讲，亵渎是指各种不敬；因此，亵渎者是指所有从心里否认神，圣言的神圣和由此而来的本质上为神圣事物的教会属灵事物，还不虔诚地谈论它们的不敬之人。我们在此论述的不是这类亵渎者，而是那些宣称信神，明确肯定圣言的神圣并承认教会的属灵事物之人；然而，他们当中大多数人只是口头上这样说。这些人之所以犯亵渎罪，是因为来自圣言的某种神圣之物在他们里面并在他们当中，他们亵渎的，正是在他们里面，并构成他们的理解力和意愿的一部分的这某种神圣之物。但否认神性和神性事物的不敬之人里面没有能被亵渎的神圣之物。他们的确是亵渎者，但本身不是亵渎的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 229</h4><p>229. (3) There are many kinds of profanation of the sacred, but this kind is the worst of all. In its most general sense profanation means all impiety. Thus by profaners are meant all impious persons, people who at heart deny God, the holiness of the Word, and consequently the spiritual concerns of the church - concerns which are fundamentally sacred - and who also speak of these impiously. <p>However, we are not speaking of such persons here, but of people who profess a belief in God, assert the holiness of the Word, and acknowledge the spiritual concerns of the church - though most with the mouth only. These commit profanation because they have a sense of the sacred from the Word among them and in them, and it is this which they have in them, and which forms part of their intellect and will, that they profane. In contrast, the impious who deny the Divine and Divine matters do not have in them any sense of the sacred for them to possibly profane. They are indeed profaners, but still are not themselves profane. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 229</h4><p>229. 3. There are many kinds of profanation of what is holy, but this is the worst of all. In everyday language, profanation is understood to mean all kinds of irreverence, so the category of profane people includes everyone who at heart denies God and the holiness of the Word and therefore the spiritual gifts of the church. These are the very holy things that even irreverent people talk about. <p>I am not talking about these people, though, but about people who confess God, insist on the holiness of the Word, and acknowledge the spiritual gifts of the church, most of whom do so only verbally. The reason they are committing profanation is that there is something holy from the Word within and among them. It is this something within them, something that is part of their own discernment and volition, that they are profaning. In irreverent people, people who deny the Divinity and divine matters, there is nothing holy for them to profane. It is the former who commit profanation, then, even though they are not irreverent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 229</h4><p>229. III. THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF PROFANATION OF WHAT IS HOLY, BUT THIS IS THE WORST KIND OF ALL. In the most general sense by profanation is meant all impiety; and therefore by profaners are meant all the impious who in their heart deny God, the holiness of the Word, and consequently the spiritual things of the Church which are essentially holy things, and who also speak impiously of these. Of such profaners we are not here treating, but of those who profess a belief in God, who maintain the holiness of the Word, and who acknowledge the spiritual things of the Church, most of them, however, with the lips only. These commit profanation because what is holy from the Word is in them and with them, and this which is in them, constituting part of their understanding and will, they profane; but in the impious, who deny the Divine and Divine things, there is nothing holy which they can profane. These are indeed profaners, and yet they are not profane at heart. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 229</h4><p>229. (3) There are many kinds of profanation of what is holy, but this is the worst kind of all. In the most general sense profanation means all impiety; and therefore profaners mean all the impious, who in heart deny God, the holiness of the Word, and the spiritual things of the church therefrom, which are essentially holy things, and who also speak impiously of these. But of such we are not now treating, but of those who profess to believe in God, who assert the holiness of the Word, and who acknowledge the spiritual things of the church; most of whom, however, only with the mouth. Such commit profanation for the reason that what is holy from the Word is in them and with them, and this which is in them and which makes some part of their understanding and will they profane; but in the impious, who deny the Divine and Divine things, there is nothing holy that can be profaned. Such are profaners, and yet they are not profane. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 229 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>229. III. Quod plura genera prophanationum sancti sint, et quod hoc genus sit omnium pessimum. In communissimo sensu per prophanationem intelligitur omnis impietas; ita per prophanatores intelliguntur omnes impii, qui corde negant Deum, sanctitatem Verbi, et inde spiritualia Ecclesiae, quae ipsa sancta sunt, de quibus etiam impie loquuntur. Sed de his hic non agitur, verum de illis qui Deum profitentur, sanctitatem Verbi statuunt, et spiritualia Ecclesiae agnoscunt, plerique tamen solum ore: causa quod hi prophanent, est quia sanctum ex Verbo est in illis et apud illos, et hoc quod in illis est, et quod facit aliquid illorum intellectus et voluntatis, prophanant: at vero in impiis, qui Divinum ac Divina negant, non est aliquod sanctum quod prophanare possunt: hi quidem sunt prophanatores, sed usque non prophani. </p>
