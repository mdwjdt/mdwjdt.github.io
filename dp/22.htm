<h4 align="center"></h4><p>22、然而，许多人已经破坏，并仍在破坏这种婚姻，尤其通过将信与仁分离来破坏它，因为信属于真理，真理属于信，仁属于良善，良善属于仁。他们由此在自己里面将邪恶与虚假结合起来，就这样成为良善与真理的对立面，并继续成为对立面。然而，主规定，它们要通过平衡、对照和洁净而服务于其他人里面良善和真理的结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 22</h4><p>22. But because many have sundered and continue to sunder this marriage, especially by the separation of faith from charity (for faith is connected with truth, and truth with faith, and charity is connected with good, and good with charity), and because as a result they conjoin evil and falsity in themselves and so have become and continue to become opposed to that marriage, the Lord provides that they nevertheless still serve to promote the union of goodness and truth in others by providing an equilibrium, contrast, and means of purification. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 22</h4><p>22. However, many people have broken this marriage and still do. They do this especially by separating faith from thoughtful living (faith being a matter of truth and truth a matter of faith, with thoughtful living being a matter of goodness and goodness being a matter of thoughtful living). By so doing they unite what is evil and false within themselves and have become opponents, and continue to be so. The Lord nevertheless provides that they may still help unite what is good and true in others through balance, comparison, and purification. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 22</h4><p>22. However, as many have broken and are breaking this marriage, especially by the separation of faith and charity, for faith is of truth and truth is of faith, and charity is of good and good is of charity, and as they thereby unite in themselves evil and falsity, and have thus become and continue to be opposed [to good and truth], nevertheless the Lord provides that they shall still be of service for the union of good and truth in others by means of equilibrium, related sequence and purification. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 22</h4><p>22. But inasmuch as many have sundered or are sundering this marriage, especially by the separation of faith from charity, since faith is of truth and truth is of faith, and charity is of good and good is of charity, and inasmuch as they thereby conjoin evil and falsity in themselves, and have thus become or are becoming opposite [to good and truth], the Lord provides that such shall still be of service for the conjunction of good and truth in others, as means of equilibrium, relation and purification. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 22 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>22. Sed quia multi ruperunt et rumpunt hoc conjugium, imprimis per separationem fidei a charitate, nam fides est veri ac verum est fidei, ac charitas est boni et bonum est charitatis, et per id conjungunt apud se malum et falsum, et sic oppositi facti sunt et fiunt: ut tamen hi usque inserviant pro conjunctione boni et veri apud alios, providetur a Domino per aequilibrium, per relationem, et per purificationem. </p>
