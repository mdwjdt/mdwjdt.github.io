<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第196节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>196、既然正是人的心智而非他的身体在思考，并且心智出于其情感的快乐进行思考，既然人的心智就是他死后活着的灵，那么可推知，人的灵无非是情感和由此而来的思维。思维离了情感是不可能的，这一点从灵界的灵人和天使的状态很清楚地看出来。在那里，所有人都基于其生命之爱的情感进行思考，这些情感的快乐像大气一样包围着每个人。在那里，所有人都照着通过他们的思维从他们的情感发出的那些气场而联结在一起。此外，在那里，从各人的生命气场就能认识到各人的性质。由此可见，每个思维都来自某种情感，是其情感的一个形式。意愿和理解力，良善和真理，以及仁和信都是如此。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 196</h4><p>196. Now, because it is a person's mind and not the body that thinks, and does so owing to the delight of its affection, and because a person's mind is his spirit which lives after death, it follows that a person's spirit is nothing but affection and its consequent thought. <p>The impossibility of any thought apart from affection is clearly apparent from the circumstance of spirits and angels in the spiritual world, that all there think in accord with the affections of their life's love, and that the delight of these affections surrounds each one as his atmosphere. Moreover, all are conjoined there in accordance with these atmospheres that emanate from their affections through their thoughts. The character of each is known, too, from the atmosphere of his life. <p>It can be seen from this that every thought springs from some affection, and that it is a form of that affection. <p>It is the same with will and intellect; so, too, with good and truth; and so, too, with charity and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 196</h4><p>196. Since it is our mind, not our body, that thinks, and since its thinking is prompted by the pleasure of its feelings, and since our mind is our spirit that lives after death, it follows that our spirit is nothing but our feelings and consequent thinking. <p>It is obvious from spirits and angels in the spiritual world that there can be no thinking apart from feeling. All the people there think on the basis of the feelings of their life's loves, and the pleasure of these feelings surrounds everyone like his or her own atmosphere. All the people there are united according to these auras that are breathing out from their feelings through their thoughts, and the nature of everyone there is recognized by the aura of her or his life. <p>We can tell from this that every thought arises from some feeling and is the form of its feeling. It is the same with our volition and discernment, and the same with what is good and what is true, and with caring and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 196</h4><p>196. Now since it is man's mind and not his body that thinks, and thinks from the delight of his affection, and since man's mind is his spirit, which lives after death, it follows that man's spirit is nothing but affection and thought derived from it. That there can be no thought without affection is plainly evident from spirits and angels in the spiritual world, because all there think from the affections of their life's love, and the delight of these affections presses close around each one as his atmosphere; and because all are united in accordance with these spheres which emanate from their affections through their thoughts. Moreover, the character of each one is known from the sphere of his life. Hence it may be evident that every thought is from affection and is the form of its affection. It is the same with the will and the understanding; also with good and truth; and also with charity and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 196</h4><p>196. Since, then, it is man's mind and not his body that thinks (and it thinks from the delight of its affection), and since man's mind is his spirit, which lives after death, it follows that man's spirit is nothing but affection and the thought therefrom. That no thought is possible apart from affection is clearly evident from the state of spirits and angels in the spiritual world, in that all there think from the affections of their life's love, and the delight of these affections encompasses every one as his atmosphere; and all are joined together in accord with these spheres that exhale from their affections through their thoughts. Moreover, what each one is is recognized from the sphere of his life. From all this it may be seen that every thought is from an affection, and is a form of its affection. It is the same with the will and the understanding; also with good and truth; also with charity and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 196 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>196. Nunc quia Mens hominis est, quae <sup>1</sup>cogitat, ac cogitat ex jucundo affectionis suae, et non corpus, <sup>2</sup>et quia Mens hominis est ejus spiritus, qui vivit post mortem, sequitur quod spiritus hominis non sit nisi quam affectio et inde cogitatio. Quod non dari queat ulla cogitatio absque affectione, manifeste patet ex spiritibus et angelis in Mundo spirituali, quod omnes ibi cogitent ex affectionibus amoris vitae illorum, et quod jucundum illarum circumstipet unumquemvis, sicut athmosphaera ejus; et quod secundum has sphaeras <sup>3</sup>exhalatas ex affectionibus per cogitationes illorum, omnes ibi conjungantur: quisque etiam ex suae vitae sphaera cognoscitur qualis est. Ex his constare potest, quod omnis cogitatio sit ex affectione, et quod sit forma suae affectionis. Simile est cum voluntate et intellectu; et simile est cum bono et vero; et simile cum charitate et fide.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1 Prima editio: qtae<p>2 Prima editio: corpus;<p>3 Prima editio: spaeras </p>
