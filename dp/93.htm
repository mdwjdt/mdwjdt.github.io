<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣治》 第93节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>93、在灵界，我蒙允许听见并看见那些相信一切良善皆来自主的人和那些相信良善来自他们自己的人之间的区别是何性质。那些相信良善来自主的人面向主，接受良善的快乐和幸福。而那些相信良善来自他们自己的人却专注于自己，心里认为他们已经赚得良善。他们因专注于自己，故只能感受到他们自己的良善的快乐；这不是良善的快乐，而是邪恶的快乐。因为属于人的自我之物都是邪恶；邪恶的快乐当被感觉为良善时，就是地狱。那些行出良善，却相信它来自他们自己的人死后若不接受这个真理，即：一切良善皆来自主，就会与地狱魔鬼为伍，最终与他们合而为一；而那些接受该真理的人会得到改造。不过，除了那些在生活中仰望神的人以外，没有人接受它。在生活中仰望神不是别的，就是避恶如罪。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 93</h4><p>93. What the difference is between people who believe that all good originates from the Lord and those who believe that good originates from themselves is something I have been granted to both hear and see in the spiritual world. <p>Those who believe that good originates from the Lord turn their faces to Him and receive the delight and blessedness of good. But those who believe that good originates from themselves look to themselves and inwardly think to themselves that they deserve the credit. Moreover, because they look to themselves, they cannot but take delight in their own goodness, which is not a delight in good but a delight in evil. For a person's native character is evil, and a delight in evil perceived as good is what constitutes hell. <p>People who have done good and believed that it originated from them, if after death they do not accept the truth that all good originates from the Lord, fall in with infernal genii and at length join them. <p>By contrast, those who accept this truth are reformed. But the only people who accept it are those who have looked to God in their lives. To look to God in one's life is nothing else than to refrain from evils as sins. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 93</h4><p>93. In the spiritual world you can hear and see what the difference is like between people who believe that everything good comes from the Lord and people who believe that goodness comes from themselves. People who believe that goodness comes from the Lord turn their faces toward him and find a pleasure and a bliss in what is good. In contrast, people who believe that goodness comes from themselves focus on themselves, thinking inwardly that they have earned it. Since they are focused on themselves, all they can feel is a pleasure in their own goodness, and this is not a pleasure in goodness but a pleasure in evil--because what really belongs to us is evil. When pleasure in evil is felt as good, that is hell.  <p>After death, people who have done good in the belief that it came from them cannot accept the fact that everything good comes from the Lord. They mingle with hellish demons and eventually unite with them. However, people who accept this truth are reformed, though the only people who do accept it are the ones who have turned to God during their lives. Turning to God during our lives is nothing but abstaining from evils as sins. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 93</h4><p>93. It has been granted me to hear and to see in the spiritual world what the difference is between those who believe all good to be from the Lord and those who believe good to be from themselves. Those who believe good to be from the Lord turn the face to Him and receive the delight and the blessedness of good; but those who believe good to be from themselves look to themselves and think within themselves that the merit is theirs. Because they look to themselves they are able to perceive only the delight of their own good, which is not the delight of good but the delight of evil. For what is man's own is evil, and the delight of evil when perceived as good is hell. Those who have done good and have believed it to be from themselves, if after death they do not receive the truth that all good is from the Lord, mix with infernal spirits (genii) and at length act in common with them; while those who receive that truth are reformed. However, only those receive it who have looked to God in their life; and looking to God in the life is nothing else than shunning evils as sins. </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 93</h4><p>93. The nature of the difference between those who believe all good to be from the Lord and those who believe good to be from themselves it has been permitted me both to hear and see in the spiritual world. Those who believe good to be from the Lord turn the face to Him, and receive the enjoyment and the blessedness of good. But those who believe good to be from themselves look to themselves and think in themselves that they are meritorious. And because they look to themselves they are able to perceive the enjoyment of their own good only, which is not the enjoyment of good but the enjoyment of evil. For what is man's own (proprium) is evil; and the enjoyment of evil when perceived as good is hell. Those that have done good and have believed it to be from themselves, if after death they do not receive this truth that all good is from the Lord, mingle with infernal genii, and at length come to be one with them; while those that receive this truth are reformed. But none receive it except those who have looked to God in their life. Looking to God in their life is nothing else than shunning evils as sins. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 93 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>93. Quale discrimen est inter illos, qui omne bonum credunt a Domino esse, et qui credunt bonum a se esse, datum est in Mundo spirituali et audire et videre: qui bonum credunt a Domino, illi vertunt faciem ad Ipsum, ac recipiunt jucundum et beatum boni; at qui credunt bonum a se esse, illi spectant semet, et cogitant apud se quod meruerint; et quia spectant semet, non possunt aliter quam jucundum sui boni percipere, quod non est jucundum boni, sed jucundum mali; nam proprium hominis est malum, ac jucundum mali perceptum ut bonum, est infernum. Illi qui bonum fecerunt, et crediderunt id a se, si non post mortem recipiunt id verum, quod omne bonum sit a Domino, commiscent se geniis infernalibus, et tandem unum cum illis faciunt: at illi qui recipiunt illud verum, reformantur; sed non alii recipiunt, quam qui spectaverunt ad Deum in vita sua: spectare ad Deum in vita sua, non aliud est quam fugere mala ut peccata. </p>
