<h4 align="center"></h4><p>23、主通过天堂与地狱之间的平衡来提供其他人里面良善与真理的结合。因为邪恶与虚假一起不断从地狱发出，而良善与真理一起不断从天堂发出。只要活在世上，每个人都被保持在这种平衡中，由此被保持在思考、意愿、说话和行动的自由中，他能在这种自由中被改造。因为这属灵平衡赋予人自由，对此，可参看《天堂与地狱》一书<a href="../hh/589.htm">（589-596</a>，<a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603节）</a>。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Rogers translation 2003) 23</h4><p>23. The Lord provides for the union of goodness and truth in others through the equilibrium between heaven and hell. For from hell come continual exhalations of evil and at the same time of falsity, while from heaven come continual exhalations of goodness and at the same time of truth. Every person is held in this equilibrium as long as he lives in the world, and kept thereby in the freedom of thinking, willing, speaking and acting in which he can be reformed. (Concerning this spiritual equilibrium, which makes possible a person's freedom, see the book <a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell 589-596</a>-<a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dole translation 2003) 23</h4><p>23. The Lord provides for the union of what is good and true in others by the balance between heaven and hell. What is evil and what is false are continually breathing out together from hell, and what is good and what is true are continually breathing out together from heaven. Every one of us is kept in that balance as long as we are living in this world, and this is what gives us our freedom to think, intend, speak, and act, the freedom in which we can be reformed. (On this spiritual balance that gives us our freedom, see <a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell 589-596</a>, <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Dick and Pulsford translation 1949) 23</h4><p>23. The union of good and truth in others is provided for by the Lord by means of the equilibrium between heaven and hell; for there is a constant emanation from hell of evil and falsity together; but from heaven there is a constant emanation of good and truth together. In this equilibrium every man is kept as long as he lives in the world, and is thereby kept in that liberty of thinking, willing, speaking and doing, in which he can be reformed. For this spiritual equilibrium from which man has freedom see the work HEAVEN AND HELL (n. <a href="../hh/589.htm">589-596</a>, <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Divine Providence (Ager translation 1899) 23</h4><p>23. The conjunction of good and truth in others is provided by the Lord, by means of the equilibrium between heaven and hell; for there is a constant exhalation from hell of evil and falsity together, while from heaven there is a constant exhalation of good and truth together. In this equilibrium every man is held as long as he lives in the world; and by means of it he is held in freedom to think, to will, to speak, and to do, and in this it is possible for him to be reformed. (Respecting this spiritual equilibrium, from which man has freedom, see <a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell 589-596</a>, <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">De Divina Providentia 23 (original Latin, 1764)</h4><p>23. A Domino providetur conjunctio boni et veri apud alios per AEQUILIBRIUM inter Coelum et Infernum; ex Inferno enim continue exhalatur malum et simul falsum, ex Coelo autem continue exhalatur bonum et simul verum; in hoc Aequilibrio tenetur omnis homo, quamdiu in mundo vivit, et per id in libertate cogitandi, volendi, loquendi et faciendi, in qua potest reformari. De hoc Aequilibrio spirituali, ex quo Liberum homini est, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_23/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_589">de COELO ET INFERNO 589-596</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_23/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_597">597-603</a>. </p>
