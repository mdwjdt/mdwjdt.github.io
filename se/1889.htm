<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1889</h4><p>1889. The general kinds of speech of spirits, both evil and good, thus far observed are these: the 1st is the speech all spirits have in common, consisting of mental images alone, with little or no feeling.<p>The 2nd is almost devoid of spiritual mental imagery, thus without sounding words, being only tacit, a speech of feelings. Such is normally the speech of evil spirits, or demons, who control our feelings or desires, distorting them in such a way that we are unaware how we are being led; for they secretly bend our good feelings around into evil ones.<p>The 3rd kind is like a flow, sometimes behaving like a pulse, in different ways. This is their inner language, in which they are also able to speak, and the speech manifests itself in that flow.<p>The 4th kind consists of mental images without any flow, that is nevertheless perceptible as a creeping silence, which is their thinking. This speaking did not come to my perception when they talked among themselves, nor did they want me to be among them. When I was among them, their thinking was guided to agree with mine; otherwise it went according to their own. 1748, 12 April. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1889</h4><p>1889. The kinds of spirit-speech in general, as well of the evil as of the good, as now observed, are these: 1. There is a common speech pertaining to spirits formed solely from ideas with little or no affection. 2. There is a kind almost entirely devoid of spiritual ideas, and thus of sonorous words, but tacit only, and of the affections; such is usually the speech of evil spirits, or genii, who rule the affections or cupidities of men, and pervert them in such a manner that a man is not aware how he is led, as they latently reflect or bend his good affections into evil ones. 3. The third kind is like a flowing stream, but occasionally varying itself into a sort of pulse or stroke, which is their interior, in which they can speak, and their speech exhibit itself in that kind of stream. 4. The fourth kind is a speech of ideas without the fluent quality, but which is yet perceived as something tacitly creeping, which is their thought. This did not come to the perception of my thought when they conversed with each other, neither did they wish me to be present; when I was present, the course of their thought was directed according to mine, otherwise according to their own. - 1748, April 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1889 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1889. Genera loquelae spirituum in genere, tam malorum quam bonorum nunc observata sunt haec: 1(mum) est loquela communis quae est spirituum, ex solis idees, cum pauca vel nulla affectione. 2(dum) est fere absque ideis spiritualibus, ita absque vocibus sonoris, solum tacita, quae est affectionum; talis loquela etiam solet esse malorum spirituum, seu geniorum, qui affectiones seu cupiditates hominum regunt, pervertuntque tali modo, ut homo nesciat quomodo ducatur, nam inflectunt affectiones ejus bonas in malas, latenter. 3(tium) genus, est sicut fluor, quandoque se gerens sicut pulsus, diversimode; quae est interior eorum; in eadem possunt etiam loqui, et loquela se in fluore isto sistit. 4(tum) genus est idearum absque fluore, quae usque percipitur, sicut per tacitum reptile, quae est cogitatio eorum; quae ad perceptionem cogitationis meae non pervenit, quando inter se loquuti sunt, nec voluerunt, ut interessem; cum interessem, dirigebatur cogitatio eorum secundum meam; alioquin secundum eorum. 1748, 12 April. </p>
