<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1758</h4><p>1758. The Lord knows and arranges all things, even down to the very least, in the Universal Heaven, and on all earths<p>This may be apparent also from the fact in regard to the human body, that in its internal organs, cavities, membranes, both within and without, there are sensitive tissues in such abundance that nothing whatever can pass them by without their being aware of it. Quite obviously the same applies to the stomach, the liver, the lung. The tissues are shaped organically in different ways, so that the soul of a person knows and perceives whatever changes take place anywhere in the body, and according to what it so perceives, arranges the least details, inducing conditions suitable for healing whatever parts are out of order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1758</h4><p>1758. THAT THE LORD KNOWS AND DISPOSES ALL THINGS, EVEN THE MINUTEST [singularrissima] IN THE UNIVERSAL HEAVEN AND IN ALL THE EARTHS. <p>(This may appear also from the case of the human body, in the viscera, cavities, membranes of which, both within and without, there are sensitive fibers in such abundance that nothing can come in contact with them but they perceive it. That the same holds good in regard to the stomach, the liver, and the lungs, is obvious. The fibers are organically and variously formed, and by means of them the soul of man knows and perceives whatever change takes place, and according to that perception disposes of everything and induces states adapted to restore health to those parts which are out of order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1758 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1758. Quod Dominus noverit et disponat omnia in Universo Coelo, et in omnibus terris, et singularissima<p>Hoc constare quoque potest ex corpore humano <sup>1</sup></p><p>, [quod] in ejus <sup>2</sup></p><p>visceribus, cavis, membranis, intus et extus, sint fibrae sensibiles, tanta copia, ut nihil usquam praeterire queant, quin percipiant; quod in ventriculo similia, quod in hepate, in pulmone similia, satis constat, fibrae sunt organice varie formatae, inde anima hominis novit quicquid ubivis in corpore mutatur, et percipit, et secundum perceptionem istam disponit singula, ac inducit convenientes status ad medendum iis, quae inordinata sunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has humino<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has cujus </p>
