<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2088</h4><p>2088. There were some spirits, however, who were denying this, but it was recognized by some other spirits that they said this out of spite because they did not want to acknowledge and see it, and thus spoke against the truth of the matter. They even admitted this and said that they wanted to enjoy the freedom of speaking in denial. This characteristic they had brought with them from bodily life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2088</h4><p>2088. Nevertheless there were some spirits who denied it, but it was perceived by others that they said so out of malice, because they were unwilling to acknowledge and see it, and that thus they spoke contrary to the truth of the matter, which they also admitted, saying that they desired to exercise unbounded license of speech and denial. This they derived from the life of the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2088 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2088. Aliqui tamen spiritus erant, qui negabant, sed percipiebatur ab aliis, quod id dicerent ex malignitate, quod nollent agnoscere et videre, et quod sic contra veritatem rei, quod etiam fassi, dicentes, quod vellent licentia dicendi et negandi pollere, hoc traxerunt a vita corporis. </p>
