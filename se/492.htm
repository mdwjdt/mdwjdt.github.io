<p>492.关于天上的唱诗班续，他们在人体内的区域及其功能。当我醒来时，许多天使唱诗班再次歌颂他们的救主。事实上，有许多人用我所不明白的各种各样的声音同时歌颂，尽管他们发出每一个和一切极为清晰的音符；因为他们的行动越微妙或内在，他们发出的音符就越清晰。他们以各种方式歌颂弥赛亚神；尽管许多人同时进行赞美，但从声音的多样性明显可知，这些唱诗班种类繁多。我获知，他们一般分为三种类型，具有这样的性质：有些人仅仅通过代表行动；有些人既通过代表，同时也通过声音行动，在我看来，他们似乎是最微妙的，因为他们听上去好像有微妙的翅膀（412节），仿佛他们是那些可称为活着的人当中最小的；还有一些人则只通过声音行动。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 492</h4><p>492. Continuing about the heavenly Choirs, their provinces in the human body, and their functions<p>While I was awake, again many angelic choirs were celebrating their Savior by their songs, and indeed, many at the same time, with a varying sound I did not understand, even though they were executing each and every note very clearly (for the more subtle or inward the subject, the better articulated it is). They were celebrating God the Messiah in different ways, and even though there were many praising at the same time, it was evident from the tonal modulations that there was wide variety among them. I learned what those varieties are in general, namely three: those who perform solely by visual portrayals; those who do so visually and at the same time vocally, which seemed to me to be very refined, sounding as if subtly winged [cf. 412] and as if they were the least of those who can be called lives; there are others who perform by voice only. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 492</h4><p>492. CONTINUATION CONCERNING ANGELIC CHOIRS: THEIR PROVINCES AND FUNCTIONS IN THE HUMAN BODY <p>When I was awake, many angelic choirs were again celebrating their Savior by their songs. There were, in truth, many together, with a variety of sound which I did not understand, although they did each and everything most distinctly, for the more subtly or interiorly they act, the more distinctly do they do so. They celebrate God Messiah in various ways. Although there were many celebrating at the same time, it could be evident from the variety of sound that there was a great variety of these choirs. I learnt of what quality are three of their varieties in general: namely, there are those who act by means of representations alone; there are those who act both by representations and at the same time by words, who seemed to me to be most subtle, as they sounded as if they were subtly winged, and as though they were the least of those who can be called lives. The other kind are those who act by means of words alone. </p>
