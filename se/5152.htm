<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5152</h4><p>5152. About heaven, and the love and wisdom of those who are there<p>It is said that those who are in the heavens have love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor. But those who don't know how they have love and charity can believe that that it is simply [a feeling of] loving the Lord and loving the neighbor. But this is not so. True love to the Lord consists in loving to do the things that the Lord commands, thus the Divine Truths that are in the Word, and to love these. Their love to the Lord consists in this, and their love to the neighbor consists in loving to do the things that the doctrine of their Church teaches, thus to do these things from faithful belief. To them, this is loving the neighbor. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5152</h4><p>5152. CONCERNING HEAVEN AND THE LOVE AND WISDOM OF THOSE WHO ARE THERE.<p>It is said, that those who are in the heavens are in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor; but they who do not know in what way they are in love and charity, may believe that it is only by entertaining a sentiment of love for the Lord and the neighbor; but this is not the case. But, in truth, love to the Lord consists in the fact that they love to do those things which the Lord has commanded, thus the Divine Truths which are in the Word, and to love them. In this their love to the Lord consists. And love towards the neighbor, with them, consists in the fact that they love to do those things which the doctrine of their Church prescribes, thus, to do those things from faith: this, to them, is loving the neighbor. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5152 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5152. De coelo, et eorum amore et sapientia qui ibi<p>Dicitur quod illi qui in coelis in amore in Dominum sint, et in charitate erga proximum, at qui non sciunt quomodo in amore et in charitate sint, credere possunt quod solum sit amare Dominum, et amare proximum, sed non ita est; verum amor in Dominum consistit in eo, quod ament facere illa quae Dominus praecepit, ita Divina Vera quae in Verbo, ac amare illa, illorum amor in Dominum in eo consistit: et amor erga proximum consistit apud eos in eo, quod ament facere illa quae dictat doctrina Ecclesiae eorum, ita ex fide facere illa; hoc illis est amare proximum. </p>
