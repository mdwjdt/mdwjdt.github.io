<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3914</h4><p>3914. It was said that their purgings recur repeatedly, so that they become as skeletons, just as happens to others with whom purgings recur by turns, so that they may be initiated into their compliant services which become their functions in the other life. For everyone is introduced in the other life into their own functions, because into their own uses, which the purgings of course look to as their purpose. 1748, 9 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3914</h4><p>3914. It was said that their vastations recur quite often, so that they become skeletons, as is the case with others, to whom vastations occur by turns, that they may be initiated into their services, which become their functions in the other life, for everyone in the other life is initiated into his functions, because they are reserved for uses, which also vastations regard, or which they have for an end. - 1748, November 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3914 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3914. Dictum, quod saepius recurrant eorum vastationes, ut fiant sicut sceleta, sicut apud alios, apud quos per vices recurrunt vastationes, ut initientur in obsequia eorum, quae eorum functiones in altera vita fiunt, nam quisquis ad functiones suas, quia ad usus, in altera vita initiatur, quos quoque vastationes spectant, seu pro fine habent, 1748, 9 Nov. </p>
