<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2283</h4><p>2283. There are besides prophetical influences different from these, namely that leave the persons completely in control of themselves, with their own thinking, just as at other times, the only difference being that spirits speak with them, and when they are ordered to do certain things, to make certain gestures, as the true prophets were commanded to do-like building walls, or attacking, and such things spoken of here and there in the Word-these influences occur by way of an inner conviction, namely, that one is so commanded by the Lord. When there is this conviction, one cannot possibly resist because one is convinced that the Lord has commanded it, and therefore one does it, as if from oneself. I have been taught this several times by actual experience, and I know for certain that it is really the case.<p>Written in the presence of spirits. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2283</h4><p>2283. Moreover, other prophetic influxes are also given, different from these [quam tales], to wit, [such] that they are wholly their own masters as to their thought, quite as in other respects only that spirits speak with them; and when they are ordered [iis imperatur] to do similar things and to gesticulate, like as the true prophets were commanded, [as] that they should construct walls [and] besiege [them], and the like, of which also the Word [treats] here and there; these influxes take place by internal persuasion, to wit, that it is so commanded by the Lord; and when there is such a persuasion they can by no means resist [it], because the persuasion is that it is so commanded by the Lord, and thus man acts as from himself. This also I was taught several times, through living experience, and know for certain that such is the case. - [This is] written in the presence of spirits. - 1748, June 10. </p>

Praeterea quoque dantur alii influxus prophetici, quam tales, nempe quod prorsus sint sui juris, suae cogitationis, prorsus sicut alioquin, solum quod cum iis spiritus loquantur, et quum iis imperatur agere similia, et gesticulari, sicut etiam veris prophetis mandatum est-ut <sup>1</sup></p><p>nempe quod muros struerent, oppugnarent, et similia, de quibus etiam passim in Verbo-hi <sup>2</sup></p><p>influxus fiunt per persuasionem internam, quod nempe ita mandatum sit a Domino, et cum talis persuasio est, nequaquam resistere possunt, quia est persuasio, quod a Domino mandatum, et sic agit homo, ut a semet; hoc quoque per vivam experientiam aliquoties edoctus sum, et scio pro certo, quod res se taliter habeat.
