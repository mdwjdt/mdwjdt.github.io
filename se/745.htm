<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 745</h4><p>745. <sup>1</sup> # Continuation about the robbers in the desert, and the city<p>But there was also one who in his crawling got wrapped up in a fine net, so that he was unable to pull himself out of it, but was anxiously crawling greater and greater distances and being tormented. These are the ones whom they want to temper by torture, before admitting them, but likewise afterwards by a spear which the spirit kept holding in his hand, and which formed a leg of that angle [<a href="750.htm">750</a>, <a href="752.htm">752</a>], and around which a veil was wrapped, under which the spirit [being tormented] had been put. Finally he broke out near the point of the spear, but together with the veil, and not within the boundary toward the city, but toward me, on high. So this is a sign that such a spirit would not enter into that place, or that city.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;745-48 are placed here in accordance with instructions in the manuscript. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 745</h4><p>745. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE ROBBERS IN THE DESERT, AND CONCERNING THE CITY <p>But there was one who, whilst he was thus creeping along, became involved in a line net, so that he was unable to extricate himself; he became anxious owing to the greater distances he would thus have to creep and suffer torture. These are they whom they want to temper by means of torments, before they admit them. The [admitting] spirit <sup>1</sup>continually held a spear in his hand, determining that angle, and thereby later the veil, beneath which the spirit was admitted, was twisted about. He at length burst forth near the point of the spear, but with the veil, not within the boundary to the city, but on high towards me. Thus this is a sign that such a one would not enter into that place, or that city. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Index (s.v. Judaei) he is called an angel; in AC 941, a good spirit. </p>
