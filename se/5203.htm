<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5203</h4><p>5203. Those who were on the mountains and rocks were those who are mentioned in Revelation. They are those of the second resurrection [20:5] because the second resurrection is the resurrection of those who are in the latter times of the church and who are evil. Those who are of the first resurrection are those who were from earlier times, and not those who followed later and were good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5203</h4><p>5203. Those who were on the mountains and rocks, were they who are mentioned in the Apocalypse as of the second resurrection; for the second resurrection is the resurrection of those who are in the latter days of the Church; who, also, are evil. Those are of the first resurrection, who lived in primitive times, also those of the times next following, and were good. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;It is worthy of note that no "second resurrection" is mentioned in the Apocalypse. Swedenborg, at this time, evidently considered that the express mention of a first resurrection (<a href="../ar/851.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 851</a>, where, also, the true spiritual significance of the matter here referred to, is given. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5203 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5203. Qui super montibus et petris erant, erant illi qui memorantur in Apocalypsi qui sunt ex altera resurrectione [XX: [5], nam altera resurrectio est resurrectio eorum qui in posterioribus temporibus in Ecclesia sunt, et qui mali, [illi] ex prima resurrectione qui prioribus temporibus, et non qui sequioribus et boni. </p>
