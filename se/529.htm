<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第529节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>529.关于木星居民（续）。他们当中的一个灵人也向我展示了他们如何通过面部表情的变化，也就是说，通过极细微的肌肉动作，尤其嘴唇周围的肌肉动作而互相交谈。这就是为何这个区域有如此多错综复杂、交织在一起的肌肉纤维的原因。然而，如我所以为的，眼睛周围表现出他们的情感，也就是说，他们更内在的情感。因为脸是内在人的代表，它的形成是为了能说话，如前面所说的灵人（528节），因为脸及其形式的变化和状态的变化会显示出他们的内层。但我不明白他们通过嘴唇周围的纤维变化向我展示什么，因为我的脸从小就没有在这方面得到训练并习惯它们；我只能感受到一些变化。这也是木星灵无法伪装的原因，他们活在其生活的秩序中，以致他们无法对同伴隐瞒任何事，而同伴立刻就能知道这事，知道他们的品质，以及他们正在梦想的东西和他们所做的事。因此，与他们在一起的生活是属灵的，这种人能立刻被挑出来，然后接受教导和改造。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 529</h4><p>529. Continuation about the inhabitants of Jupiter<p>One of them also showed me how they speak to each other by changes of facial expression, that is, by tiny little movements of their muscles - especially those around the lips. This is why there are in that region so many interwoven muscular chains. But it is around the eyes, I presume, that their feelings are displayed, that is, their more inward feelings, for the face is a reflection of the inward person, as was explained [<a href="528.htm">528</a>] in regard to the spirits who display faces, with their changing shapes and varying features.<p>But what they showed me by changes in the tissues around the lips, I could not understand - I could only feel the changes - because my face was not, from early childhood, trained in them and accustomed to them.<p>The fact that they cannot put on pretenses, but follow the true order of their life, is likewise the reason why they are unable to conceal anything whatsoever from their companions, without their knowing it at once, and knowing what they are like, and what they are dreaming up, and what they have done. So life with them is spiritual, and such persons can at once be singled out, and then taught, and be reformed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 529</h4><p>529. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF JUPITER <p>It was also shown me by one of their spirits how they spoke with each other by variations of the face, namely, that it was by means of very slight movements, especially of those muscles which are around the lips, which is the reason that there are so many intricate series of muscular [fibers] there. Around the eyes, however, are represented, as I suppose, their affections, that is, the more interior affections. For the face is the representation of the interiors of man, formed so that it may be able to speak, as was said of spirits, since the face with its change of forms and its variation of state displays their interiors. But I could not understand what they showed me by the variations of the fibers around the lips, because my face has not been initiated and accustomed to them from infancy; I could only feel the variations. This also is the reason that the spirits of Jupiter are unable to simulate, but live in the order of their life, so that they can hide nothing whatever from their companions who at once know both of what quality they are, and what they are imagining to themselves and also what they have done. Thus with them the life is spiritual, and they can at once be separated, and thus be taught and reformed. </p>
