<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2417</h4><p>2417. When I had grasped and written down these facts, evil spirits who were present said they did not know what mercy and innocence are, being surprised that they exist. They even scorned them to the point where they symbolically strewed them beneath my feet, 1748, 27 June.<p>From their action on me and on the spirits who were present, it was made known what a state society would be in if such spirits mingled with it. Then something like a painful blow was felt, which happens in different ways depending on the nature of those who are unmerciful and those who are merciful, so they cannot be together. This was further portrayed to me by their being aroused out of a compassionate state of mind into one of cruelty, whereby mercy in spirits of that nature is turned into its opposite. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2417</h4><p>2417. Evil spirits who were present said, when I had perceived and was writing these things, that they were ignorant what mercy and innocence are; they wondered that they are granted; yea, to such a pitch that by means of their representations they scattered them under my feet; thus despised them. - 1748, June 27. From their operation on me and spirits who were present, it was given to know of what quality the society would be, if such should be therein. Then there was felt, as it were, a painful injurious principle [quoddam dolorificum laedens], which happens with variety according to the nature of those who are merciless, and those who are merciful; wherefore, they cannot be together; which was [still] further represented to me by this, that from a state of mercy they were incited to cruelty, so that mercy is turned into the contrary, with spirits of such a nature. </p>

Quod magis repraesentabatur mihi ab iis, quod ex statu misericordiae incitarentur in crudelitatem, sic misericordia in contrarium apud talis naturae spiritus vertitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;nisi legeris daretur<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Junius ex </p>
