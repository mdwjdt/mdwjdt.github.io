<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5456</h4><p>5456. Those who were the better of them were brought down from there to a great multitude toward the north, beyond the deserted Babylonian region there, and were sent into a plain, far toward the north. This tract ends there in forests where there are those who are as it were wild animals. There they go into crypts in various places and are scarcely seen on the plain. The tract of those there is in the northern side toward the eastern northern side toward the eastern corner there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5456</h4><p>5456. They who were the better amongst them, were, to a great multitude, carried down thence towards the north, beyond the deserted Babylonish region there, and let into a plain, at a great distance northwards. There, this region is terminated in woods, in which are those who are as it were wild beasts. They enter into vaults in various places there, and scarcely ever appear above the surface. The tract of those there, is on the northern side, towards the eastern angle thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5456 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5456. Illi qui meliores ex illis erant, inde tunc delati sunt ad magnam multitudinem versus septentrionem, ultra tractum Babylonicum desertum ibi, et missi in planitiem, ad multam distantiam versus septentrionem, qui tractus terminatur ibi in sylvas, ubi illi qui ferae quasi sunt; intrant ibi in cryptas variis in locis, et vix apparent super planitie; tractus illorum ibi est in parte septentrionali versus orientalem angulum ibi. </p>
