<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4048</h4><p>4048. About the holy spirit<p>I realized that people could understand well enough that no spirit is holy, especially from the fact that the holy spirit proceeds from the Lord, and that this means that the holy spirit is the Lord's, that this is to proceed. What else proceeds from anyone but what is his? Moreover the Lord has declared this openly, and has shown by His breathing upon them, that they were receiving the Holy Spirit, and that it is from Him [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>]. 1748, 23 Nov.<p>From the Lord there proceed truths and higher knowledge of faith, which are His and directed toward Him, because from Him. Higher knowledge of faith, and goodness, and truths, are holy, nor do they belong to anyone but the Lord, because the Lord is faith, and the all in all things of faith. These are what proceed from the Lord, and when they come through angels and spirits, they do not know that they are speaking. And then they can be called the holy spirit, because it is the Lord, Who is proceeding through them as through instruments and mediums. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4048</h4><p>4048. CONCERNING THE HOLY SPIRIT.<p>It was perceived that men could clearly enough comprehend that there is no Holy Spirit [as a third Person in the Trinity], especially from this, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Lord, by which is signified that the Holy of the Spirit is [the Holy] of the Lord, and this is implied in its proceeding; for what else proceeds from anyone than what is of him [or his essence]; besides that the Lord openly declared this and demonstrated it by breathing [upon the disciples and saying to them] that they should receive the Holy Ghost, and that it was from Him. - 1748, November 23. From the Lord proceed the truths and the knowledges of faith, which are of Him and to him, because from Him. The knowledges of faith, goodnesses and truths are holy things, nor do they pertain to anyone but the Lord, for the Lord is faith and the all of all faith; these are the things which proceed from the Lord, and when this proceeding is through angels and spirits, they know not that they speak, and then they may be called the Holy Spirit, because it is the Lord Who proceeds through them as organs and mediums. - 1748, November 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4048 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4048. De spiritu sancto<p>Perceptum, quod satis intelligere potuissent homines, quod nullus spiritus sit sanctus, imprimis ab eo, quod spiritus sanctus procedat a Domino, et quod hoc significet, sanctum spiritum esse Domini, hoc esse procedere; quid aliud procedit ab aliquo, quam quod Ipsius est? praeterea quod aperte hoc dixerit Dominus, et ostenderit, per inspiratum Ipsius, quod acciperent Spiritum Sanctum, et quod ab Ipso [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4048/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_20_22" target=_top>Joh. XX: 22</a>]. 1748, 23 Nov. A Domino procedunt veritates et cognitiones fidei, quae sunt Ipsius, et ad Ipsum, quia ab Ipso, cognitiones fidei, bonitates et veritates sunt sancta, nec usquam alius quam Domini, quia Dominus est fides, et omnis omnium fidei, haec sunt quae procedunt a Domino, et cum per angelos et spiritus, nesciunt quod ii loquuntur, et tunc spiritus sanctus possunt dici, quia est Dominus Qui per eos, ut per organa et media, procedit. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
