<p>302.关于那些不断致力于研究，从而自以为很智慧之人死后的生命。今天，我被领到我之前确曾去过的一个住地，只是当时不知道这是谁的住地。那里有一片宽广的开敞空间，上面有许多马车和军械库。有马车和马匹的地方，也有许多人似乎四处走动或坐在马车里到处转；当我问他们是谁时，其中一个靠近我，打听那些活在世上时大有学问的人，问他们当中哪一个名气比别人更大。于是，我提到两三个我所认识的；但与我同在的天使指教我说，在那个地方过生活的人忙于研究，但仍具有正常的理智，尽管他们没有将自己的心智哲学延伸到天上的事物。（1747年12月5日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 302</h4><p>302. About the life after death of those who are continually engaged in studies, and who think they make them wise<p>I was guided today into one habitation in which I had surely been before, but without knowing at the time whose habitation it was. It is like a broad field on which are many chariots and arsenals. Where the chariots and horses are, there are many people who seem to be walking or riding in chariots hither and thither; and when I inquired who they were, one of them, approaching me, inquired about those alive [in the world] who are highly educated, asking which ones had achieved fame above the rest. Then I mentioned two or three whom I knew. But I was informed by the angels with me that those pass their life in that place who are much occupied with studies, but who are nevertheless of sound reason and do not impose the philosophy of their mind on heavenly things. 1747, the 5th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 302</h4><p>302. CONCERNING THE LIFE AFTER DEATH OF THOSE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY ENGAGED WITH STUDIES, AND HENCE SUPPOSE THAT THEY ARE WISE <p>I was led today into a habitation in which indeed I had been before, but I did not then know whose habitation it was. There was, as it were, a wide open space, where there were many chariots with armories. There were very many persons where the chariots and horses were, and they seemed to themselves to be walking about and to be carried hither and thither in the chariots: and when I inquired who they were, one of them drawing near asked about those who in their lifetime had been learned, and which of them had acquired a greater reputation than the others. Then I mentioned two or three whom I knew; but I was instructed by the angels who were with me, that those pass their life there, who devote themselves a great deal to studies, but yet are of sound reason, though they do not extend the philosophy of their mind to heavenly things. 1747, Dec. 5. </p>

De vita eorum post mortem, qui continuo studiis invigilant, et inde sapere se putant<p>In unam mansionem hodie perductus sum, in qua quidem prius fueram, sed ignorabam tunc quorum mansio esset; est latus quasi campus, in quo sunt multi currus, cum armamentariis; ubi currus et equi, ibi perplures sunt, et sibi videntur ambulare, et per currus vehi, huc illucque, cumque inquirerem, quinam ii essent, unus eorum accedens <sup>1</sup></p><p>inquirebat de iis qui in vita docti sunt, et quinam famam prae caeteris aucupati, tunc duos tresve memorabam, [quos] novi <sup>2</sup></p><p>, verum ab angelis mecum instructus sum, quod ibi vitam agerent, qui studiis multum invigilant, sed usque qui sanae rationis sunt, nec in coelestia philosophiam mentis extendunt. 1747, die 5 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has acceedens<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has novi ubi novi forte delendum </p>
