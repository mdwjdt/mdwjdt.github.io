<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3022</h4><p>3022. Further, since human beings are the last of order, ideas terminate in their memory, or in the material images of their memory. And because all ideas terminate there, even those of spirits, and they are therefore receptacles of spirits' ideas and there is an unbroken ordered connection leading right to them, spirits cannot think otherwise than that their ideas begin in themselves and from themselves, when yet they are in the human's ideas, where they terminate. This is evident from the fact that spirits appropriate to themselves every least thing of people [they are with], speaking their language as if it were their own, unable to know any better. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3022</h4><p>3022. Moreover since man is the ultimate of order, therefore [his] ideas are terminated in his memory, or in the material ideas of his memory: and since all ideas are there terminated, even [those] of spirits and thus [these ideas] are the recipients of the ideas of spirits, and a continual nexus of order follows up to that point, a spirit cannot suppose other than that ideas begin in himself and from himself, when yet his ideas are in the ideas of man, wherein they are terminated, as may be evident from their appropriating to themselves each and all the things of man, and that they speak with his language, as if their own, and cannot know otherwise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3022 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3022. Porro cum homo sit ultimum ordinis, terminantur ita ideae in memoria ejus, seu ideis materialibus memoriae ejus; et quia terminantur ibi ideae omnes, etiam spirituum, et sic recipientia sunt idearum spirituum, et continuus nexus ordinis eo usque consequitur, non aliter putare potest spiritus quam quod in semet, et a semet ideae incipiant, cum tamen in ideis hominis, in quibus terminantur, sint ideae ejus, sicut constare potest ex eo quod approprient sibi omnia et singula hominis, et quod lingua ejus sicut sua loquantur, nec aliter scire possunt. </p>
