<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3088</h4><p>3088. About very subtle evil spirits in line with the zenith at different heights<p>A certain spirit known to me in life who had acquired a very subtle nature from keeping to himself, was with me. Through his very subtle nature he was able to speak with good inward spirits, and to persuade them, not in his own person, but that of someone else. So they could scarcely tell the difference, because it was thus permitted and granted by the Lord, whereby it can be learned what certain evil spirits are like. But he was not among those who had the worst intentions, because he was being kept in that state. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3088</h4><p>3088. CONCERNING MORE SUBTLE EVIL SPIRITS, IN A LINE WITH THE ZENITH, AT VARIOUS ALTITUDES. <p>A certain spirit, known to me in life, who was imbued with a more subtle nature [arising] from a solitary life, [ex solitudine] he [when] with [apud] me, could speak according to his nature with interior good spirits, and persuade them, not under his own person, but under another, so that they could scarce perceive otherwise; for it was so permitted and allowed by the Lord; hence can be known of what nature are certain evil spirits; but he was not amongst those who intended [proposed] the worst things, because he was held in that state. </p>
