<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3038</h4><p>3038. It is the same in all other cases, as also between people: such as one is, in such a way does the other respond, if not in outward behavior, still at heart. So people know this very well and do not go beyond what others will suffer, fearing from them the responding evil. And this happens with countless variations depending on the state of mind and nature of each person, as everyone should know. It is so engraved on nature that chicks, or even the smallest insects, resist [each other] according to the taunts and moods.<p>Now this all shows that the evil of punishment that they imagine to come from another is from themselves, for that is given as a response. If this is the case in the tiniest and in all things of nature, why not in the greatest body? But in the world of evil spirits, this takes place as it does with the human race. Reaction in the heavens is different, for there nothing of evil is inflicted on anyone, but is turned into good. 1748, 2 Sept. This was shown by experience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3038</h4><p>3038. For instance, among men, such as is one, such is the correspondence of another, if not in external modes, yet in mind [animo]; wherefore men know this well, and do not go beyond what they [others] allow, for they fear a corresponding evil from them; and this occurs with indefinite variety, according to each one's state and nature, as may be known to everyone. So this is inscribed in nature, so that young chickens, yea, the smallest insects, resist according to insults and minds [courage] [animos]. From these things, it is now apparent that the evil of punishment which they suppose comes from another, is from themselves, for such a response is given. If [it is so] in the least, and all things of nature, why not in the grand man [maxime corpore]? But in the world of spirits, such happens as in the human race. There is a different reaction in the heavens, for there on no one is any evil inflicted, but it is turned into good. - 1748, September 2. [This] was shown by experience. </p>
