<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2740</h4><p>2740. About sorcery or truldom <sup>1</sup>in the other life<p>About the aura of those who are worldly in the other life, and want to rule over others<p>Those in bodily life who are the kind to use inner cunning to attract to themselves companions and friends, and by superficial conduct slip into their company, have a quite effective aura for doing the same in the other life. And because there are so many who live for the world, enjoyment, and passions, they are also easily allured into the society of people who have such an aura, and sometimes reluctantly or unwillingly.<p>This has been shown today by an actual experience that came about by way of permission, so that I would know, and they would know, what they were like. 1748, 5 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "witchcraft." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2740</h4><p>2740. CONCERNING SORCERIES OR TRULLDOM IN THE OTHER. CONCERNING THEIR SPHERE WHO ARE WORLDLY, IN THE OTHER LIFE, AND DESIRE TO COMMAND OTHERS. <p>(They who in the life of the body are of such a nature that by means of interior craftiness they allure to themselves companions and friends, and insinuate themselves by means of externals, have in the other life a sphere sufficiently powerful to effect the like; and because there are such numbers [tam multi] who live for the world, inclination [genio] and cupidities, they are also easily allured into the society of such, and sometimes involuntarily, or when they are unwilling: for of such a nature is the sphere of these, as was shown me today by living experience. Which happened from permission that it might be known, and that [they] might know of what quality [these enticing spirits] were. - 1748, August 5. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2740 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2740. De praestigiis seu truldom {a} in altera vita. De sphaera eorum, qui mundani sunt, in altera vita, et aliis imperare cupiunt<p>Qui in vita corporis tales sunt, ut per interiores astutias alliciunt ad se socios et amicos, et per externa se insinuant, in altera vita, sphaeram satis efficacem habent, similiter faciendi, et quia tam multi sunt, qui vivunt mundo, genio, et cupiditatibus, facile quoque alliciuntur in societatem talium, et quandoque invito seu iis nolentibus, nam talis est sphaera eorum, quod hodie per vivam experientiam ostensum; quod factum ex permissione, ut sciretur, et scirent quales essent. 1748, 5 Aug. </p>
