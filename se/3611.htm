<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3611</h4><p>3611. The quality of those who argue<p>They who argue are they who doubt, and who deny. I noticed that they are easy, letting themselves be led here and there. In a nightly vision in half-wakefulness, I saw them portrayed as such, and like women who wander about outside their neighborhood who are believed to be inconstant, and that they are adulteresses or else let themselves be easily enticed to adulteries.<p>They complained about this characterization, but were told it is how they are; even if they had not committed adulteries in the act, or actually engaged in prostitution, still they were prone to it where the opportunities presented themselves and where outward bonds did not restrain them. They were compared earlier with oyster shells [<a href="2947.htm">2947</a>] that had nothing inside, being mere shells. But a soft and fat oyster within a shell symbolizes truths of nature properly confirmatory of spiritual and heavenly ones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3611</h4><p>3611. THE QUALITY OF THOSE GIVEN TO REASONING.<p>They who are addicted to reasoning are those who doubt and deny. It was perceived that they are persons of levity, suffering themselves to be led one way and another. They were thus represented in a nocturnal half-waking vision, and appeared as women wandering about through outer regions, concerning whom it is usually believed that such are distinguished for levity [leves sunt], as also that they are adulterous, or easily ensnared into adultery, of which [some] complained [respecting them]. But it was said to them that if they did not actually commit adultery or lewdness, yet they were prone to it upon suitable occasions, and when external bonds did not restrain. They were resembled in the first instance to oyster shells, containing nothing inside, being mere shells; but an oyster soft and fat within signifies things that are natural, by which spiritual and celestial things are well confirmed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3611 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3611. Quales qui ratiocinantur<p>Qui ratiocinantur, sunt qui dubitant et qui negant; apperceptum, quod ii sint leves, huc illuc duci se patientes, in visione nocturna demivigili, repraesentati sic, et quasi faeminae quae exteras regiones vagantur, de quibus creditur quod leves sint; tum quod adulterae seu facile pellici se ad adulteria patiuntur, super quod conquesti, sed iis dictum quod tales sint, si non actualiter adulteria fecerint, aut scortati sint, usque faciles, ad occasiones datas, et externis vinculis non retinentibus: assimilati prius crustis ostreae [cf. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3611/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2947" target=_top>2947</a>], in quibus nihil intus, sic crustacei; at ostrea mollis et pinguis quae intus significat ea naturalia, quibus confirmantur bene spiritualia et coelestia. </p>
