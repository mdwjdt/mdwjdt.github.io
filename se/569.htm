<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>569.当来自木星的一个恶灵在我身边，想要为我所思所行的事责备我时，木星天使也在场，如前所述（541-42节）。这时他们使我的脸，尤其嘴唇周围的区域保持上扬，嘴张开，使我的表情始终愉快、欢笑。后来我被告知，他们就是这样使那个地区居民的脸保持愉快，而非悲伤的，因为那时似乎有天使在场。恶灵只知道他正站在自己星球居民的身旁。（1748年1月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 569</h4><p>569. When an evil spirit of the earth Jupiter was at my side, wanting to reprove me for things I had thought and done, the angels of that earth were also present, as mentioned earlier [541-542]. They were then holding up my face, especially the area around the lips - my mouth open, and my expression ever cheerful and laughing. Later I was told that this is the way they keep the inhabitants of that region, so that they have a cheerful countenance, not a sad one, for the reason, as it seems, that angels are present.<p>The evil spirit did not know otherwise than that it was an inhabitant of his earth at whose side he was standing. 1748, the 26th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 569</h4><p>569. When the evil spirit from the planet Jupiter was at my side, and wished to reprove me concerning things thought and done, and the angels of that earth were present, as was said [nos. 541-2], they then kept my face, especially the region around the lips, elevated, with the mouth open, and my face continually cheerful and laughing. Later it was said to me that they thus keep the inhabitants of that region so that their faces are cheerful, not sad, because, as it seemed, the angels are then present. That evil spirit knew no otherwise than that he was standing by an inhabitant of his own earth. 1748, Jan. 26. </p>
