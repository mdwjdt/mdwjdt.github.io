So it was that they allied themselves especially with hypocrites, because by their outward appearance these could give the misleading appearance of being angels of light. This they themselves in fact admitted, that they, the hypocrites, were those with whom they had allied themselves, and that although they knew they were such, still they loved them and associated with them. When these were examined, they were found to be hypocrites, because a person who wants be in control is no<p>[5791] 1.2. other and at heart is unable to worship the Lord. Most spirits like this climb into the mountains and rocks, and when they come there they seek for nothing other than be able to govern others. Consequently they decline to be in any other position, saying that they know no other and that they were like this. When one looks into their nature, [one finds] they were those who were totally indifferent to the concerns of others, having no interest other than simply control over others, and that they are vauxriens <sup>1</sup>, lazy, and want to be respected by others, and that when they do not get this, they then take themselves outside the society and look down and exercise control over all whom they see; and they harm them, because they love no-one but themselves. Such are found for the most part in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and elsewhere, but few in England, since there they are have concern for their household and business matters.ؓuch are being cast down to the number of thousands, which<p>[5791] 1.3. is happening by act of the Lord separating those who are good from them, in this way taking away their communication with the good. When these have been separated, what their nature is appears. Earlier it is not evident, and when their natures are evident, it appears that they are vauxriens <sup>1</sup>concerned with nothing else than doing harm; for this reason they are cast down. Spirits like this have no concern for anything pertaining to wisdom. They speak as if they understood everything, but about nothing do they have an intelligent idea.<p>[5791] 1.4. They think they are wiser than others. A large part of them were those who ran along to wherever they found delight, going so from one place to another, leaving everything at home, and so snatched their life's delight from others, as societies of friendship do, and diverted it into themselves, as a result of which others who felt delight from their useful activities and in their duties were driven into a miserable state. And they did this because they did not compel themselves to [perform] any duties, except only for the sake of a high office and gain, and so of pleasure, and they do nothing for the sake of useful service. Most of these were those who sought positions in royal courts and kingdoms. Spirits like this, because they are vauxriens, in the other life run along to wherever delight is said to be found. All of these were thrown down so that they might be reduced to a wretchedly unpleasant state, to the point that they finally felt some delight in performing useful services.</p><p>[5] And also, when they come to others they go into their homes and stay there, although those there say no. Consequently the owners leave their homes, in part of themselves, in part because they are driven out by those new arrivals. I have seen these and others not being thrown out but sinking down,<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;French for "rascal" </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5791</h4><p>5791. Hence it came to pass that they allied themselves principally with hypocrites, because they are able to simulate angels of light in the external form; which also they themselves confessed, [namely], that these were those to whom they bound themselves; and although they knew that they were such, still they loved them and consociated themselves with them. When, also, these were examined, they were hypocrites; for he who desires to rule is nothing else: he is not able to acknowledge the Divine in heart. <p>5791a. The majority who are of such a character go up into mountains and rocks; and, when they come there, they seek nothing else than to be able to gain pre-eminence over others; thus they decline to be in any employment, saying that they do not know [how to do] anything else, and that they were of such a nature. When inquiry is made as to what sort they are, they were such as performed no other functions than solely to rule over others, and that they are good-for-nothings and idle, but wish to be honored by others; and when they do not obtain this, they betake themselves outside the society, and look down and domineer over all whom they see. They also do evil to them, because they love no one but themselves. Such are to be found for the most part in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and elsewhere; but there are few in England, because there they give attention to their domestic affairs and business concerns. <p>5791b. Such ones are cast down, to the number of myriads. This occurs by the following means, namely, that the Lord separates the good from them; consequently, takes away their communication with the good; separated from whom they appear such as they are. Previously, they are not known; and, when they are shown as they are, it is seen that they are good-for-nothings, caring for naught but doing evil: wherefore they are cast down. Such ones never care anything for wisdom. They speak as if they understood all things; but they do not possess an intelligent idea about any matter. They suppose themselves to be wiser than all others. <p>5791c. Great part of these were such as rushed off to every place where they found delight, and so went from one place to another, forsaking all home duties. Thus, also, they bore away from others the delight of their life, as do societies of friendship, and drew it to themselves; whence, others, who had delight from uses and in their duties, were reduced to a wretched state. <p>5791d. And they did this, because, in the world, they did not tie themselves down to any calling, save for the sake of honor and of gain, and thus of pleasure, and did nothing on account of use. The greatest part of them are such as seek posts in courts and kingdoms. Such ones, because they are good-for-nothings, in the other life rush off wherever there is said to be enjoyment. All these are cast down, in order that they may be reduced to a state of undelight and wretchedness; but, still, in such wise that they may at length perceive somewhat of delight in performing uses. When, also, these come to others, they enter their homes and stay there, although those who dwell there object: hence, the rightful owners go forth out of the house, partly of themselves, partly are turned out by those interlopers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5791 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5791. tales qui propter dominia adorant Divinum. Inde factum est, quod ligaverint se imprimis cum hypocritis, quia illi lucis angelos ex externa forma mentiri possunt; quod etiam ipsi fassi sunt, quod illi essent quibus se alligaverint, et tametsi sciverint quod tales essent, usque amarent illos, et se consociarent illis; cum explorati etiam illi hypocritae fuerunt, nam qui dominari vult, is non<p>[5[791] 1/2. alius est, non potest Divinum agnoscere corde. Plerique tales ascendunt in montes petras cum ibi veniunt, nihil aliud quaerunt, quam ut praeesse possint aliis, ita ut recusent in aliqua functione esse, dicentes quod non aliud sciant quod tales fuerint; cum inquiritur quales sunt, fuerunt qui nihil fecerunt aliorum curas, quam solum dominari super alios quod sint vauxriens, otiosi volunt honorari ab aliis cum hoc non obtinent, tunc conferunt se extra societatem despiciunt ac dominantur super omnes quos vident; illis mala faciunt, quia neminem amant quam semet: tales dantur quoad maximam partem in Germania, Sveria, Dania alibi, sed pauci in Anglia, quoniam ibi sua domestica negotia curant. - Tales dejiciuntur myriades, quod fit <p>[5[791] 1/3. per id quod Dominus separet ex illis bonos, ita adimat communicationem cum bonis, quibus separatis, apparent quales sunt, prius non patent cum patent quales sunt, apparet quod sint vauxriens, nihil curantes quam mala facere, quare dejiciuntur. Tales nusquam aliquid sapientiae curant, loquuntur sicut intelligerent omnia, sed de nulla re ideam intelligentem <p>[5[791] 1/4. habent, putant se prae caeteris sapientes esse. - Multa pars ex illis erant, qui percurrebant, ubicunque inveniebant jucundum, sic ab uno loco in alterum, relinquentes omnia domi sic auferebant aliis suae vitae jucundum, sicut amicitiae societates derivabant in se, unde alii qui jucundum habuerunt ex usibus in suis officiis redigebantur in statum miserum; hoc faciebant quia in mundo non se adstrinxerunt aliqua officia, solum honoris et <p>[5[791] 1/5. lucri causa sic voluptatis propter usus nihil fecerunt, quorum maxima pars tales sunt qui quaerunt functiones in aulis regnis, tales quia sunt vauxriens in altera vita percurrunt quocunque dicitur esse jucundum, illi omnes dejecti sunt, ut redigerentur in statum injucundi miseriae, usque ut tandem perciperent aliquid jucundum in usibus praestandis: illi etiam cum alios venirent, intrant domos illorum ibi manent, tametsi illi qui ibi sunt, negant, inde possidentes e domo sua partim ex se exeunt, partim expelluntur a novis illis.
