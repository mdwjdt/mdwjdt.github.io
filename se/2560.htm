<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2560</h4><p>2560. The same thing happened to me when I was let loose, and I also at once rushed into evil. So there is nothing but evil in the human character, and goodness and mercy belong to the Lord Alone, Who holds the universal heaven and the world of spirits bound in such a way that they almost do not know they are evil, in fact, think goodness comes from them. About this matter I have spoken with [spirits] several times who were wanting to claim goodness to themselves.<p>The human race is similarly restrained, although they do not know it, so that if the spiritual bond of the Lord were loosed, one would at once rush at another as a wild animal rushes at a wild animal. About that bond still very much remains to be told, but elsewhere, as the Lord sees fit [see <a href="2737.htm">2737-2739</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>]. 1748, 7 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2560</h4><p>2560. A similar thing occurred to me when [my bonds] were remitted, I also immediately rushed into evil, so that there is nothing but evil in man's disposition, and good and mercy [belong] to the Lord alone, who so holds the universal heaven and world of spirits, as it were, bound, that they are almost ignorant that they are evil, yea, suppose that good [proceeds] from them, concerning which I have sometimes conversed with them; they wish to claim good to themselves. In a similar manner is the human race held, although [men] do not know it. Wherefore if the spiritual bonds were remitted by the Lord, one would immediately rush upon another, like wild beast upon wild beast. Concerning these bonds very many things could be said, but the Lord thinking worthy [I shall see them] elsewhere. - 1748, July 7. </p>
