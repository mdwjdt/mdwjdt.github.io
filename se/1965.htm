<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1965</h4><p>1965. As for heavenly joys, and the pleasures from truly good things, and from truths, these come only from the Lord, thus from the one and only source, and unless Goodness and Truth was coming from the one only source, that is, from the Lord, there could be no goodness and truth [anywhere], nor could any society exist. For there has to be something universal that governs all the individual parts, joining people together.<p>From this and many other considerations it is clear that the Lord Alone is Goodness and Truth. This has been confirmed within me spiritually by angels, for they are kept in that heavenly pleasure and conviction, which was communicated to me [to bring me] to that conviction. 1748, 16 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1965</h4><p>1965. As to what pertains to celestial joys and pleasures derived from genuine goods and truths, they flow from the Lord alone, as the only fountain; and unless the Good and True should proceed from this only fountain, i.e. the Lord, no goodness nor truth could be given, nor could any society exist, for the universal is that which rules all the singulars and conjoins them; from which, as well as from many things besides, it may appear that the Lord alone is the Good and the True, which was spiritually confirmed in me by the angels, for they are held in that delight and that heavenly persuasion which was communicated with me, with a view to persuasion. - 1748, May 16. </p>

Quod ad gaudia coelestia, et jucunditates a vere bonis, ac ex veris, solum a Domino veniunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>, sic ex unico fonte, et nisi Bonum et Verum ex unico fonte, h.e. a Domino, veniret, nullum dari posset bonum ac verum, nec potuisset ulla societas existere, nam universale erit, quod reget omnia singularia, et eos <sup>2</sup></p><p>{a} conjunget, exinde et perplurimis aliis constare potest, quod Dominus Solus est Bonum et Verum, quod spiritualiter in me confirmatum est ab angelis, nam ii in ea jucunditate ac persuasione coelesti tenentur, quae communicata mecum est, ad persuasionem. 1748, 16 Maj.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
