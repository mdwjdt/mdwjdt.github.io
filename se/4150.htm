<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4150</h4><p>4150. About spirits who think of future events<p>There are spirits who think of future events, due to a habit and a nature acquired in the world. They appear to have a wide face, but it is not a face, but only a wide area for a face, which narrows as the area narrows, nor is it at all living, but is only like something made of wood; neither do they speak, but only think. Because of them a person's sense becomes so general that he or she thinks nothing distinctly, and thus the mind becomes aimless. Such is the state of those who indulge in thoughts of future events, and are thereby emaciated, having no understanding. 1749, 22 Febr. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4150</h4><p>4150. CONCERNING SPIRITS WHO THINK [MUCH] OF THE FUTURE.<p>There are spirits who ponder upon the future, which they do from a habit and nature contracted in the world. They appear with a broad face, but it is not properly a face, but barely the broad area of a face, which becomes narrow in proportion as the area is narrow, nor is there aught of life in it; it is, as it were, simply a certain wooden something; neither do they speak but only think. By their means the sense of a man becomes so general that he thinks of nothing distinctly, and thus the mind remains indeterminate. Such is the state of those who give way to prevailing thoughts of the future, and thence become [mentally] emaciated, and void of understanding. - 1749, February 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4150 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4150. De spiritibus qui futura cogitant<p>Sunt spiritus qui futura cogitant, ex tali habitu et natura in mundo, ii apparent lata facie, sed non est facies, solum area lata faciei, quae tenuis sicut tenuis area, nec quid vitae inest, solum quasi quoddam ligneum, nec loquuntur, solum cogitant, ex iis fit hominis sensus tam communis, ut nihil distincte cogitet, ita mens indeterminabilis; talis status eorum qui futuris indulgent, et inde emaciantur, quibus intellectus nullus. 1749, 22 Febr. </p>
