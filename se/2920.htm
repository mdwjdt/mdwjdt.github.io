<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2920</h4><p>2920. General gyres are never returning ones<p>One who had been in the other life about 3000 to 4000 years said he knew that there are gyres, or that things roll around and repeat, for everything that exists has its own spiraling motion so that it may return. The reason for this suggested itself to me from within, namely that none of those in such a gyre should be broken [cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_3.htm">Is. 42:3</a>], but the changes imposed thereby must be moderated until they are brought gradually into different states, so that they may not be hurt. For to undergo sudden slides from one state to another, is to be broken: hence the gyres.<p>But this ancient one (Abram) said that there are a variety of general gyres that come up, which never return, as he knows from experience. So it is suggested to my thought that the variations are perpetual and eternal, and thus cannot really return. And the general gyres influence the less general, and these the individual ones, causing varieties of each according to their nature. They are spiraling motions of states. 1748, 25 Aug.<p>Instead of the ones who are worshipped, others can be adopted </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2920</h4><p>2920. THAT GENERAL [communes] GYRES ARE NEVER REPEATED [sint nusquam redeuntes.] <p>One who has been in the other life from three to four thousand years, said that he knows that there are gyres, or revolutions of things, and returns [reditus], for everything that exists has it gyre, so that it may go over [through] it again [ut redeat]. This was insinuated in me, for the reason that none who are in that gyre, should be broken: but the changes then impressed [incussae] will be moderated, until they are by degrees born into other states, so that they may not injure; for quick falls, from one state into another, is to be broken; hence [are] gyres. But that ancient one (Abram) said that there are general gyres, which are varied, and succeed, which never return, as he knows from experience; wherefore it was insinuated into my thought, that the varieties are perpetual and eternal, so that they cannot thus return; and general gyres inflow into less general [ones], and these into particular [ones]; whence each has its varieties, according to its nature. There are gyres of states. - 1748, August 24. </p>

Quod communes gyri sint nusquam redeuntes<p>Qui in altera vita fuit circiter 3 {a} ad 4000 annis, dicebat, quod sciat quod gyri sint, seu volutiones rerum et reditus, nam quod existit gyrum suum habet, ut redeat, quod penes me insinuatur ex causa, quia <sup>1</sup></p><p>nulli in gyro isto frangi debent, sed mutationes tunc incussae, moderandae erunt, usque dum sensim in alios status ferantur, ut non noceantur, nam lapsus citi {b}, ab uno statu in alterum, est frangi; inde gyri: sed dicebat is antiquus (Abram) quod sint gyri communes, qui variantur, subeuntque, qui nusquam redeunt, quod novit ab experientia: quare insinuatur cogitationi meae, quod varietates sint perpetuae et aeternae, ita non ita redire possunt; et communes gyri in minus communes, et hi in particulares influunt, unde varietates cuivis secundum suam naturam; sunt statuum gyri. 1748, 24 <sup>2</sup></p><p>Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
