<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 696</h4><p>696. About the life of souls and spirits, and its diversities<p>Each spirit has his life's own instinct, which is noticeable at a time when he is either left to himself, or is in the company of his like; but it vanishes when he is in the company of better spirits. I have seen that change [in a spirit], as well as his being brought back suddenly to his natural instinct of wanting to take something that was not his, although nothing of this was apparent to the company he was in.<p>Moreover, the life of a spirit not only changes depending upon the kind of companions he has, but is also degraded, which was likewise shown, namely, that by diminishing the number of companions to a few, his life was likewise diminished from a clever one to a rather stupid one. So the lives of souls after death are joined to different societies, and in this way also it is discerned what their character is, and with whom they harmonize.<p>In whatever society they are, souls think that they are alone and live from themselves. They are likewise explored during several states of a society of similar spirits, so that the spirits find out, as do the souls themselves, what they are like. For one is not the same in one state as in another. But societies of angels must be the same throughout changing states, because they must all let themselves be led by the Lord. 1748, 9 February.<p>mThese words [were written] in the presence of some who constituted one society.n </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 696</h4><p>696. CONCERNING THE LIFE OF SOULS OR SPIRITS, AND ITS DIVERSITIES <sup>1</sup><p>Each spirit has his own instinct of life, which is apperceived when he is either, as it were, left to himself, or is in the society of similar spirits, but it disappears when he is in the society of better spirits. I have perceived that variation, as that a spirit was suddenly reduced to his natural instinct, so that he desired to take away the goods of another, though nothing of this appeared in the society in which he had been. Moreover, the life of a spirit is not only varied according to the type of his companions, but it is also elevated. This was shown in a similar way, namely, that by diminishing the number of his companions to a few, his life in like manner was diminished from cleverness to a more stupid one. Thus the lives of souls after death are adjoined to various societies, and in this way it is discerned of what quality they are, and with whom they are concordant. In every society souls suppose that they are the only ones who live of themselves. In a similar manner they are explored by means of the diverse states of a society of the same spirits; thus it is discerned by spirits and souls of what quality they are, for one is not the same in one state as in another. But the societies of angels must be similar in the variation of their states, because they all suffer themselves to be led by the Lord. 1748, Feb. 9. <p>mThese things [were written] in the presence of those who constituted one society.n <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Crossed out: "Every soul or spirit has his own proper instinct of life, acquired doing the life of the body. This instinct is varied, and sometimes hidden when in the society of better spirits." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 696 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>696. De animarum seu spirituum vita, ejusque diversitatibus<p>Quilibet spiritus suum habet vitae instinctum, qui tunc appercipitur, cum est vel sibi quasi relictus, seu <sup>1</sup></p><p>in societate similium; at disparet quando est in societate spirituum meliorum: varietatem istam percepi, tam quod ad naturalem instinctum subito redactus sit, sic ut cupiverit auferre alienum, quod nihil apparuit in societate, in qua fui praeterea etiam vita spiritus non solum variatur secundum speciem sociorum, sed etiam exaltatur, quod similiter ostensum est, nempe per diminutionem sociorum a paucos, sic similiter vita ejus diminuebatur ab ingeniosa, a stupidiorem, ita vitae animarum post mortem variis societatibus adjunguntur, sic quoque discernuntur, quales sunt, et cum quibus concordant; putant animae in quacunque societate, quod ii soli sint qui vivunt ex se; similiter explorantur per diversos status societatis eorundem spirituum, sic internoscitur a spiritibus, et ab anima, quales sunt; unus enim non similis est in uno statu sicut in altero. At angelorum societates in statuum variatione similes esse debent, quia omnes se patientur duci a Domino. 1748, 9 Febr. [m] Haec in praesentia eorum qui unam societatem constituerunt.
