<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2727</h4><p>2727. produce all that, and nevertheless they cannot see anything in the seed nor know the causes by which all this comes forth, it should not on that account be denied, for the truth has been demonstrated.<p>So the truths declared by the Lord, and those concerning the Lord, must be believed even if we do not fathom them with our reason. And to want to deny them because we do not penetrate them with our reason is the same as wanting to deny the procreation of trees from seeds, and of animals from eggs-so in a thousand other cases. This shows what the faith of people is like when they believe nothing except what they see, which is the usual thing today, especially among the learned of the world. 1748, 3 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2727</h4><p>2727. that such a seed principle [seminatum] produces such [a result], and yet they can see nothing in the seed and know the causes whence such things exist, they do not on that account deny; for the truth is demonstrated. Thus we should believe in the truths spoken by the Lord and concerning the Lord, although we do not penetrate them by reason; and therefore to wish to deny, because we do not penetrate by reason, is like wishing to deny the procreations of trees from seeds, and of animals from eggs. It is so in a thousand other things. Hence may be manifest of what quality is the faith of man when he believes nothing but what he sees, which is common at this day, especially amongst the learned of the world. - 1748, August 3. </p>
