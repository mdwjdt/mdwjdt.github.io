<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第556节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>556.简言之，尽管他们生活得如此单纯，但他们比那些想被人学习的灵人和灵魂要聪明得多。因为他们自主察觉何为良善，甚至不想提到邪恶。有两次我想说“邪恶”，但他们都很反感。我敢说，他们比其他人聪明得多。我们的人视为智慧的细节，他们拒绝并认为毫无价值。他们说，这些细节里面毫无智慧；相反，它们阻碍了通往智慧的道路。这一点的确是最清楚不过的事实，对此，灵人，甚至我们地球上没有开始喜欢上哲学、术语、琐碎观点的人也能看得更清楚。这些人不能不在内心发笑：任何人都会由于这些事物而自以为聪明，而它们就像密云，遮蔽并模糊了一切属于真正理解力的光。事实上，这些事物不仅隐藏并夺走他们身上的光，还使他们瞎眼，因为它们距离真理如此遥远，故是无法消除的一切怀疑的源头。（1748年1月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 556</h4><p>556. In short, even though they live so simply, they are much wiser than spirits and souls who want to be learned. For they see on their own what is good, not even wanting to name "evil." Twice I wanted to say "evil," but they were averse to it. This I can declare, that they are much wiser. The details in which our people place wisdom, they reject and call worthless. They say that there is nothing of wisdom in them, on the contrary, that they obstruct the way to wisdom, which is indeed most clearly the case - something that can be seen much better by spirits, and even by people on our earth who have not acquired a taste for philosophical jargon and petty opinions. These cannot but laugh within themselves that any should think themselves wise because of such things, whereas they are like thick clouds that overshadow and obscure all the light of true understanding. For they not only hide and take away the light from them, but also blind them, being the source of all doubts that cannot be dispelled, because they lie so far away from truth.<p>1748, the 26th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 556</h4><p>556. In a word, although they live in such simplicity, they are, nevertheless, much wiser than those spirits and souls who want to be learned, for they perceive of themselves what is good; evil they are unwilling even to mention. On two occasions I wanted to say evil, but they were averse to it. I can profess that they are much wiser [than the others]. The particulars in which our people place wisdom, they reject and call worthless, because they say there is nothing of wisdom in them, but they obstruct the way to wisdom. This also is most evident as can be much better perceived by spirits than by man. It is also perceived by the men of our earth who have not become learned from philosophies, terms, particulars, and lowest things, and who cannot but laugh in themselves that any should suppose that they are wise from these things, when such things are as it were dense clouds which overshadow and darken all truly intellectual light. For these things not only conceal and take away the light, but they also blind men, for thence come all doubts which cannot be described, as they are so far distant from the truth. 1748, Jan. 26. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 556 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>556. Verbo tametsi in tali simplicitate vivunt, usque tamen multo sapientiores sunt spiritibus et animabus, qui docti volunt esse, nam ex se percipiunt, quid bonum, malum ne quidem nominare volunt, volui dicere bis "malum," sed id aversati sunt; hoc fateri possum, quod multo sapientiores sunt, particularia, in quibus nostri sapientiam ponunt, rejiciunt, et nauci vocant, quia nihil sapientiae iis inesse dicunt, sed dicunt, ea obstruere viam ad sapientiam, sicut etiam clarissimum est, quod multo melius a spiritibus percipi potest quam ab homine, sicut etiam ab hominibus in nostra tellure, qui nihil ex philosophicis, terminis, et particularibus infimis sapuerunt; ii in se non possunt non ridere, quod sapientes se putent ex iis, cum ea sunt quasi nubes densae, quae obumbrant et obtenebrant omnem lucem vere intellectualem; non enim abscondunt solum, et auferunt lucem, sed etiam occoecant eos, nam inde omnia dubia veniunt, quae discuti nequeunt, nam tam longe absunt a veritate. 1748, die 26 Jan. </p>
