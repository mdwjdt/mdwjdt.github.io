<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1253</h4><p>1253. Some of them said they were working as if on their own power and therefore thought it was they who did it, while others overhead said they were cooperating, not actively, but following along. I told them that still it was not anything but fantasy on their part. For they cannot be my body, and it is my spirit, not theirs, that is equipped with a body. To this they could give no reply. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1253</h4><p>1253. Some of them said that they were acting as if of themselves and therefore supposed that they were the ones who were acting; but others who were above the head said that they were concurring, not by acting, but as it were by following. I said to them that still it was nothing but their phantasy, for they could not be my body; but that my spirit, not theirs, was clothed with a body. To this they could make no response. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1253 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1253. Quidam eorum dicebant quod agerent sicut ex se, et sic putarent quod ii essent, qui agerent, alii vero qui supra caput, quod concurrerent, non agendo, seddquasi sequendo; quibus dixi, quod usque non sit nisi eorum phantasia, non enim ii <sup>1</sup></p><p>possunt esse corpus meum, sed quod meus spiritus, non illorum, corpore indutus sit, ad quae nihil respondere potuerunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;forte deletum in the Manuscript </p>
