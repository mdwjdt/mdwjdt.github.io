<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2476</h4><p>2476. When some said that so many revelations confused their mind, I was inspired to reply that even if they were beyond number, they would not be at all confusing, but illuminating, otherwise than in the case of those who try to deduce spiritual information by gathering data. They confuse themselves so much in many ways that to them there is nothing but confusion, to the point where they believe nothing. But those who have faith and see these matters from the viewpoint of spiritual and heavenly truths, the Lord leading them, are not at all confused, but enlightened. For them, all things down to the very least are confirmatory, as I also have seen by a spiritual mental image, so that I perceived the truth of the matter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2476</h4><p>2476. When certain said that so many revelations would confound the mind, it was given to reply that if they were innumerable, they would not confound, but illuminate, otherwise than this is the case with those who desire to deduce spiritual things from collections. These so confound themselves with many things that everything appears to them as confused, so that they still believe nothing; but those who are in faith, and see such things from spiritual and celestial truths, the Lord leading them, - these are never confounded, but are illuminated; for they are confirmed by each and all things. These things have I also seen by a spiritual idea, so that I perceived the truth thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2476 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2476. Cum quidam dicerent, quod tot revelata confunderent mentem, respondere dabatur, quod si innumerabilia essent, nihil confunderent, sed illuminarent, aliter ac apud eos, qui ex collectaneis deducere volunt spiritualia; ii se confundunt ita multis, ut nihil iis appareat nisi confusum, usque ut nihil credant, at qui in fide sunt, et a veritatibus spiritualibus et coelestibus talia vident, ducente eos Domino, ii nusquam confunduntur, sed illuminantur, nam omnia et singula iis confirmant, quae quoque idea spirituali vidi, sic ut veritatem ejus perciperem. </p>
