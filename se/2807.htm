<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2807</h4><p>2807. there are no distinctive individual elements-as in every musical instrument, and in bodily speech, and in the performance of the individual senses. These generals are as yet unknown to the scholars of the world, but still they exist. All the organic membranes of the viscera, the muscles, the organs, are generals in which and with which the individual parts exist distinctly.<p>Such was the speech of the spirit, and whether the angels had said the same as what the spirit brought out in general, I do not know. It could be that in and with the general there are other elements than those in the general, although not any that oppose. 1748, 13 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2807</h4><p>2807. There is not given a distinct singular - likewise in all musical instruments and in the speech of the body and the operations [actualitate] of each of the senses, which generals are yet unknown to the learned of the world but still are present. All the organic membranes of the viscera, muscles, organs, are generals in which and with which particulars distinctly exist. Such was the speech of the spirit, and whether the angels had spoken the same, as what the spirit uttered in general [in communi], I do not know, for there can be granted to be in and with the general, other things than what are in the general, but not such as are discordant [repugnant]. - 1748, August 13. </p>
