<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3548</h4><p>3548. The one who died as a little child and grew up in heaven was let back among spirits, so that he might learn what he was like in terms of hereditary evil. Because he had been born a prince, I perceived that he still retained a hereditary disposition to want to command, and also to regard adulteries as of no account, just as his grandfathers and great-grandfathers before him. This showed how hereditary evil clings, does not go away, but sprouts forth given the opportunity. At other times he was like he was when in heaven. 1748, 12 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3548</h4><p>3548. One who died an infant and became an adult in heaven, was remitted among spirits that he might know the quality which he had acquired from hereditary evil. He was born a prince, and I perceived that he retained a hereditary disposition to exercise dominion over others, and also that he made light of adulteries, as had also his ancestors; whence it appeared that hereditary evil adheres without receding, and that when opportunity offers it breaks out. He was otherwise [or ordinarily] such as to be capable of being imbued in heaven with mutual love in an eminent degree. - 1748, October 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3548 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3548. Qui infans mortuus, et adultus in coelo, remissus inter spiritus, ut sciret qualis esset, ex malo haereditario, quia erat princeps natus, percepi, quod usque retineret haereditarium, quod imperare vellet, tum quoque quod adulteria pro nihilo aestimaret, sicut ejus avi et proavi, inde constabat, quod haereditarium malum adhaereat, non recedat, sed propullulet data occasione: alioquin talis erat, ut dum in coelo. 1748, 12 Oct. </p>
