<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5394</h4><p>5394. <sup>1</sup>These were all brought down onto the northern plane lest they distress others who are in heaven and sadden them. Because they are ignorant in regard to such things as lead to heaven, they were let down into the northern quarter. And it was said that they are allowed to live together, but that since this kind of behavior was never commanded, they ought not by any means lead a life of leisure, their hands idle, going about in pretended melancholy.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Paragraph 5393 is missing in the original manuscript. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5394</h4><p>5394. <sup>1</sup>All of them were brought down to a place in the north, that they might not harass, and plunge in sadness, others, who are in heaven. They were brought down to the northern quarter, because they were in ignorance of such things as lead to heaven; and it was said that they were allowed to dwell together, but that they ought by no means to pass a slothful life and thus hang their heads and go as it were melancholy, inasmuch as such conduct has never been commanded. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The numbering strictly follows the original, omitting number 5393. -ED. </p>
