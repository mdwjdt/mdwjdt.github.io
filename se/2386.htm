<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2386</h4><p>2386. About the sense of touch with spirits<p>Some were greatly surprised that spirits had the sense of touch, and indeed, a very keen one, when yet they were spirits, and it was contrary to their every notion in the life of the body that spirits could have touch.<p>I was inspired to say to them that this should in no way be surprising, since a person during life has the sense of touch and the rest the senses not from the body, but from the spirit that is in the body, from which the body has its life. Without the life of the spirit, there cannot be a life of touch in the body, as there cannot be eyesight without the sight of the spirit. Whatever is vital in the body, is not of the body, but of its spirit, for which reason the same vital element remains. For spirits imagine that they are in the body, but this opinion finally ceases.<p>This is the cause of sensations of physical touch, which exist only with those recently come from the life of the body into the other life. Other more delicate senses succeed, which still all must relate to the sensation of touching in order to be senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2386</h4><p>2386. CONCERNING THE SENSE OF TOUCHES WITH SPIRITS. <p>Certain greatly wondered that spirits had the sense of touch, and, indeed, an exquisite one, then yet they were spirits, and it was contrary to all their opinion in the life of the body that spirits can have touch. It was given to tell them that this should by no means be wonderful, since man during life does not have the sense of touch, and the other senses, from the body, but from the spirit that is in the body, from which the body has its life. Without the life of the spirit, cannot be given the life of touch in the body, like as there is no sight of the eye apart from the sight of the spirit. Whatever appears vital in the body, does not belong to the body, but to its spirit. Wherefore, after the death of the body, a similar principle remains; for the spirit supposes itself to be certainly in the body, which opinion at last ceases. This is the reason of the corporeal touches, which only exist with them who come recently from the life of the body into the other life. Subtler senses succeed, all of which must still be referred to the sense of touch, in order that they may be senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2386 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2386. De sensu tactuum apud spiritus<p>Mirati valde sunt quidam, quod haberent sensum tactus, et quidem exquisitum spiritus {a}, cum tamen essent spiritus, et hoc contra omnem eorum opinionem in vita corporis, quod spiritus possint habere tactum; iis datum est dicere, quod hoc nequaquam mirum esse debeat, cum homo in vita sensum tactus et caeteros sensus non habeat a corpore, sed a spiritu qui est in corpore, a quo corpus suam vitam habet, absque vita spiritus non dari potest vita tactus in corpore, sicut visus oculi non absque visu spiritus, quodcunque apparet in corpore vitale hoc non corporis est sed spiritus ejus, quare post vitam corporis simile manet, nam putat spiritus se prorsus esse in corpore, quae opinio tandem cessat, haec causa tactuum corporeorum, qui modo existunt apud eos, qui recens e vita corporis in alteram vitam veniunt, succedunt sensus subtiliores, qui omnes usque ad sensationem tactus se referre debeant, ut sint sensus. </p>
