<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4096</h4><p>4096. About life<p>[It should be observed] that the life of man and spirit ought to be one, which is true life, namely a life of love and thence of higher knowledge of faith, and then of things confirmatory. Such a life is truly angelic, and existed at the time of the most ancient Church; and when loves were gradually turned into passions, and then into falsities, dreadful persuasions arose with the people before the flood, then a life of persuasions. After the flood, the life was separated and made into two lives - namely, one of passions, which remained and was passed down and increased hereditarily, but the life of faith was made into a life unto itself, and separated, so that there might be a life of faith - indeed of higher knowledge of faith, which is the life of the Church after the flood - and finally, since they were not acquainted with external rites, they were inaugurated into that life, then into the precepts of the law, of which they were also ignorant. Therefore also at this day there is a life of faith without love, which still cannot enter into heaven, before the Lord has joined it with a life of love. 1748, 28 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4096</h4><p>4096. CONCERNING LIFE.<p>[It may be observed] that there ought to be to man and spirit one life, which is true life, to wit, that of love, and thence of the knowledges of faith, and thus of things confirming. Such a life is truly angelic, and such was at first the life of the Most Ancient Church; but when [their pure] lives were successively turned into cupidities, and thence into falsities, there arose the direful persuasions of the Antediluvians; thus the life of persuasions. After the flood the life was severed, and there became two lives, namely, one of cupidities, which remained, being hereditarily transmitted with increase, while [the other], the life of faith, was made a life by itself and separate; for there may be given a life of faith, yea, of the knowledge of faith, which was the life of the Church after the flood; and at length, as they were ignorant of external rites, they were inaugurated into that life and then into the precepts of the law, which they had not previously known. Wherefore there is also given at this day a life of faith without love, which, however, cannot enter heaven, unless the Lord shall previously have conjoined it with the life of love. - 1748, November 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4096 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4096. De vita<p>Quod vita debeat esse homini et spiritui una, quae vera vita, nempe amoris, et inde cognitionum fidei, et sic confirmantium, talis vita est vere angelica, tum fuerat antiquissimae Ecclesiae, et cum amores successive versi sunt in cupiditates, et inde in falsitates, inde ortae antediluvianorum, dirae persuasiones, sic vita persuasionum; post diluvium, separata est vita et factae binae vitae, nempe una cupiditatum, quae remansit, et haereditario translata et aucta, sed vita fidei facta est vita per se, et separata, ut dari queat vita fidei, imo cognitionum fidei, quae est vita Ecclesiae post diluvium, et tandem, cum nescirent ritus externos, in eam vitam inaugurati sunt, tum in praecepta legis, quae quoque non sciebant; quare etiam hodie datur vita fidei absque amore, quae usque non in coelum intrare potest, antequam Dominus conjunxerit eam cum vita amoris. 1748, 28 Nov. </p>
