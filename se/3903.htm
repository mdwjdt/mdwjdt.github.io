<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3903</h4><p>3903. How difficult it is for those who do not have faith to live the life of faith<p>Certain ones who were high overhead, not from among the evil, but those who desired to have faith, were in an aura in which they were not thinking and speaking on their own power - something that is clearly perceived among spirits - and while they were aware of this fact, they then said they could not live thus, for their life then became a burden to them, so to speak. I was prompted to say that since it is the truth that they do not think and speak from themselves, why do they not like to live in the truth? But this was of no avail, for to live thus was difficult for them. I was also prompted to say that the angels are then in their happiness when they realize that they do not live on their own power; but that consolation was of no avail. This showed how burdensome life is even for the good, to live the life of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3903</h4><p>3903. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN FAITH TO LIVE THE LIFE OF FAITH.<p>Certain spirits, not of the evil, but of those who wished to be in faith were high above the head, and in such a sphere that they neither thought nor spoke from themselves, which is manifestly perceived among spirits, and when they were in this perception they said they could not live thus, for their life was then, as it were, burdensome to them. It was given to ask why, since this was true, that they did not think nor speak from themselves, they loved not to live in the truth? But this availed nothing; it was still difficult for them so to live. It was moreover given to say, that the angels are then in bliss when they perceive that they do not live from themselves. But neither did this comfort them. It thence appeared how burdensome is the life even of those who are good, [when required] to live a life of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3903 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3903. Quam difficile sit iis qui non in fide vivere vitam fidei<p>Quidam qui alte supra caput, non ex malis, sed ab iis qui volebant in fide esse, in [tali] sphaera erant, quod non ex se cogitarent et loquerentur, quod manifeste apud spiritus percipitur, in qua perceptione cum essent, tunc dicebant quod sic non possent vivere, nam vita eorum tunc iis erat quasi gravis: dicere dabatur, quod cum hoc verum sit, quod non cogitent et loquantur ex se, quare non ament vivere in veritate? sed nihil valebat hoc; sed iis erat vivere ita difficile: dicere dabatur etiam quod angeli tunc in felicitate sint, cum percipiant se non vivere ex se, sed consolatio illa non valebat; inde constabat, quam gravis sit vita etiam eorum qui boni sunt, vivere vitam fidei. </p>
