<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1150</h4><p>1150. Persecution of innocent people brings out the stench of wall lice<p>At times I have smelled the stink of filthy wall lice when yet there were no such creatures present, as I very well knew. But when I realized that that smell was spread by some form of corruption of spirits, I was taught by actual experience, corroborated [by angels], that that bad smell portrays the persecution of innocence. For there were some present who had persecuted little children, and were trying to chase them away; as a result, that stench arose immediately. 1748, 3 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1150</h4><p>1150. THE PERSECUTION OF THE INNOCENT PRODUCES THE STENCH OF WALL LICE <p>At times I have smelt the horrid stench of wall lice when yet there was nothing of the kind there as I very well knew. But after I perceived that such a stench was diffused from some fault of spirits, I was instructed by living experience which confirmed that such a stench represents the persecution of innocence; for there were those who have persecuted infants and wanted to drive them away, hence there was of once such a stench. 1748, Mar. 3. </p>
