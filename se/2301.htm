<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2301</h4><p>2301. But it must be rightly understood what is meant by entering into spiritual matters through earthly philosophy, namely that it is not at all forbidden to support religious truths and spiritual matters by things in nature, since there is a correspondence of all things. For then the truth is in command, and natural truths serve to support it, human minds being such that they acknowledge spiritual things better in this way. And no one can have any idea of purely spiritual things except by means of things in the world, even words, by which meanings are expressed, since the mental imagery of human minds is material. Then the Lord, Who is Truth itself, leads and influences, and so the Lord lights up the mind with confirmations.<p>But not to believe in anything, or not to acknowledge any spiritual truth, not even heaven, angels, spirits, life after death, among other things, unless one sees and grasps them by means of earthly philosophy - or as they say, unless they are demonstrated to one's senses - this is utterly forbidden. Then one becomes of the kind who began thus to investigate [Divine mysteries], 1748, 11 June.<p>Why try to see spiritual and heavenly things from earthly ones, which is impossible? How can what is compound, if I may use this term, enter and fathom the component parts? This is a complete impossibility, so if one attempts it, one will either burst and thus perish, or else be struck blind and be able to see nothing at all: whereas from spiritual things as the components, the compounds can be seen, and rightly discerned. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2301</h4><p>2301. But it should be closely understood what is meant by entering into spirituals through natural philosophy, to wit, that it is never forbidden to confirm the truths of faith and spirituals by the things that are in nature, because a correspondence of all is given; for then the truth has command, and natural truths serve to confirm it. Human minds are so constituted that they thus may better acknowledge spirituals, for no one can have any idea of purely spiritual things save by the things in the world; even [in regard to] words by which senses are expressed, the ideas thereof are material; for then the Lord leads and inflows, who is Truth itself and thus the Lord illuminates the mind by confirmations. But to believe nothing, or to acknowledge no spiritual truth, as not even to [admit] a heaven, angels, spirits, the life after death, and many [other] things, unless they are seen and perceived by natural philosophy, or as they say, unless they are demonstrated to their senses, this is wholly forbidden; then do they become of such sort who began thus to examine. - 1748, June 11. Wherefore they wish to see spirituals and celestials from naturals, which is impossible. How can that which is compound, as I may say, enter and penetrate those things that are components; this is against all possibility; wherefore if it attempts, would either be burst asunder, and so perish, or be struck blind so as to see nothing at all. But from spirituals, as from components, the compounds may be seen and wholly discerned. - 1748, June 11. </p>

Sed probe intelligendum est, quid intelligatur per intrare in spiritualia per phiiosophiam naturalem, nempe, quod nusquam interdictum sit confirmare veritates fidei et spiritualia, per res quae in natura sunt, quia correspondentia omnium datur, tunc enim imperat veritas, et veritates naturales inserviunt ei confirmandae, tales sunt mentes humanae, ut sic melius agnoscant spiritualia, nam pure spiritualium <sup>1</sup></p><p>nemo aliquam ideam potest habere, nisi per ea quae in mundo sunt, imo voces, quibus sensus exprimuntur, earum ideae sunt materiales, tunc enim Dominus ducit et influit, Qui est Ipsa veritas, et sic illuminat Dominus, mentem per confirmantia; at vero nihil credere, seu nullam veritatem spiritualem agnoscere, ut ne quidem coelum, angelos, spiritus, vitam post mortem, et plura, nisi ea videat et percipiat per philosophiam naturalem, vel sicut ajunt <sup>2</sup></p><p>, nisi ad sensus eorum demonstrata sint, hoc prorsus interdictum est, tunc ejuscemodi fiunt, qui coeperunt sic penetrare, 1748, 11 Junius; quare <sup>3</sup></p><p>videre volunt spiritualia et coelestia ex naturalibus, quod impossibile; quod compositum est, ut ita dicam, quomodo intrare et penetrare potest ea quae sunt componentia? hoc contra omnem possibilitatem est, quare si tentat, vel disrumperetur, et sic periret, vel occoecaretur, ut nihil prorsus videre possit, at ex spiritualibus <sup>4</sup></p><p>, sicut ex componentibus, videri possunt composita, et probe discerni. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has spiritualia<p>2.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Junius: quare<p>4.&nbsp;The Manuscript has spiritualis </p>
