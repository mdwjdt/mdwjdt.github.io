<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2111</h4><p>2111. <sup>1</sup>Meanwhile, I had written some things about the neighbor, and that one should not hate the neighbor. They were then in an almost heavenly state, and declared that to them this was now abominable and horrible, since it destroys all the happiness they had felt. So they hated themselves when they harbored hatred.<p>There is still deep silence, which is strange. It has now lasted more than an hour. Thus they are as if put to sleep, so as to feel nothing, being brought back in this condition. Not even the least sound is heard from them, although they are present.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Paragraph 2110 does not appear in the original. </p>

There is still a deep silence, which is a rare thing; it has now lasted more than an hour. Such is their lethargy, as it were, that they feel [perceive] nothing, to such a state are they brought. Indeed, not the least thing is heard by them, although they are present. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Number 2110 is missing in the original. </p>
