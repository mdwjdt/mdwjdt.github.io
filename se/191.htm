<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第191节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>191.关于人在来世的本性。在来世，人们和活在肉身时不一样，因为这时他们不能伪装，不能说一套，做一套，也不能明明是邪恶的，却利用精明的头脑装出一副善良的模样。那时，属于意愿的本性保留下来，而属于理解力、没有烙印在人本性上的东西则会消失。所以，没有人能伪装成另一种人；相反，他们会处于自己的意愿，并照之生活。也有一些诡诈的灵人，能伪装成天使的样子；但他们是最坏的，然而，他们本性中根深蒂固的诡诈仍会暴露出来。这类灵人很少被允许进入我，因为他们远离其他人，免得其他人被玷污，这当中的原因有很多。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 191</h4><p>191. About the character of people in the other life<p>People in the other life are not the same as in the life of the body, for now they are not able to pretend, to say one thing and do another, and, making use of the mental intellect, to put on goodness when they are evil. The character pertaining to the will now remains, while matters pertaining to the understanding that have not been branded upon one's character, pass away. So no one is able to pretend to be a different kind of person than they are in their will, thus in the way they live.<p>There are even deceptive spirits who are able to put on the appearance of angels; but they are the worst, and the cunning ingrained in their character is nevertheless exposed. Few such spirits have been admitted to me, for they must be kept far away from the company of others so that others may not be contaminated, and for many more reasons. 1747, the 31st day of August (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 191</h4><p>191. CONCERNING THE NATURE OF MEN IN THE OTHER LIFE <p>Men in the other life are not such as they are during the life of the body, for they cannot then dissemble, they cannot say one thing and do another, and by the good conduct of their intellectual mind they cannot feign what is good when they are evil. Their nature then remains such as is the quality of the will. The intellectual things which have not been inscribed upon their nature pass away, so that no one can pretend to be other than he is in his will, and he acts accordingly. There are also deceitful spirits who can put on the outward appearance of angels, but these are the worst spirits; and it is still made manifest that cunning is implanted in their nature. Few such spirits were admitted to me, for they have been removed from the company of others lest these others should be defiled, and this for many reasons. 1747, Aug. 31, o.s. </p>

De hominum indole in altera vita<p>Homines in altera vita non tales sunt, quales in corporis vita, tunc enim non possunt simulare, aliud dicere et aliud agere, et mentis intellectualis beneficio mentiri bonum quum sunt mali, indoles tunc, qualis est voluntatis, manet, intellectualia aufugiunt, quae non indoli inscripta sunt, ita nullus mentiri possunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>aliam personam, quam est voluntate, sic qualiter agit; spiritus dantur etiam dolosi, qui induere possunt angelorum speciem, sed sunt pessimi, et usque manifestatur, quod astutia indoli eorum implantata est, pauci tales admissi sunt ad me, nam remoti erunt a consortio aliorum, ne inquinentur, et ob plures causas. 1747, die 31 Aug. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic manuscript; vide praefationem hujus editionis sub capite "Idiosyncrasies" </p>
