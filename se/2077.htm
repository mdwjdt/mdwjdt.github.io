<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2077</h4><p>2077. The subject of reflection was then discussed, and the fact that such spirits are not in a reflective state of mind, because they are being led by their own nature, and that if reflection were given them, then unless the Lord granted it, there would be no reformation because they would try to act from their own powers, which would be to make themselves worse and to force themselves to keep from showing it. This is not granted, either, among many other disadvantages [if reflection were given them]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2077</h4><p>2077. Then also there was discourse concerning reflection as that such spirits are not in a state of reflection, because then they are led by their own nature, and that should reflection be granted to them, that then unless the Lord permitted there would be no reformation, because they would then wish to act from their own strength, which would be to make themselves worse, and to force themselves not to appear so, which is not allowed. Other disadvantages also would ensue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2077 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2077. Loquutum etiam est tunc de reflexione, quod tales sint in statu non reflexionis, quia tunc ducuntur suamet natura, et quod si reflexio iis daretur, nisi concedente Domino, quod nulla tunc reformatio, quia ex propriis viribus tunc vellent agere, quod foret se pejorem facere, et se coercere ne pateat, quod nec conceditur, praeter plurima alia incommoda. </p>
