<p>272.关于一个被下放到低地，最终被提升上来的人。有一个人被下放到低地，最终被提升上来；但他一路上极其辛苦地工作，竭尽全力，努力上升，只是虽努力了很长时间，却是枉然。我由此能够推断，这种上升和提升通过弥赛亚神而来，唯独祂将困苦人从坑里释放出来，把他们提升上来，带入天堂。这人在劳碌的时候，我与他交谈，后来他被允许从低级事物之地出来；因此，这一真理通过活生生的经历得以证实。（1747年11月27日或28日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 272</h4><p>272. About a certain one let down into the lower place, who was finally raised up<p>A certain one who had been let down into the lower place was finally being raised up, but on the way he labored very hard and struggled with the greatest exertion and labor to ascend, but for a long time it was in vain. From this, I was able to infer that an ascent and raising up comes through God the Messiah, Who Alone releases the miserable from the pit, and elevates and bears them into the heavens.<p>I spoke with this person while he was laboring, and after he was allowed to emerge from the place of the lower ones; so the truth of this has been witnessed to by actual experience. 1747, the 27th or 28th of November. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 272</h4><p>272. CONCERNING SOMEONE WHO WAS LET DOWN INTO THE LOWER PLACE, WHO WAS AT LENGTH RAISED UP <p>A certain [spirit] who had been let down into the place of lower things was at length raised up; but on the way he labored very hard and endeavored with the utmost assiduity and labor to ascend, but for a long time in vain. From this I could conclude that ascent and elevation are by God Messiah, Who alone releases the miserable from the pit, elevates them, and carries them into the heavens. I spoke with that spirit when he was laboring, and after it had been granted him to emerge from the place of lower things, so that the truth was testified by living experience. 1747, Nov. 27 or 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 272 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>272. De quodam qui in inferiorem locum demissus, tandem elevaretur<p>Quidam in locum inferiorum demissus, tandem elevabatur, sed in via is admodum laborabat, nitebaturque summo studio et labore ascendere, sed diu incassum, ex quo concludere potui, quod ascensus sit ac elevatio per Deum Messiam, Qui Solus miserabiles ex fovea exsolvit, et elevat, inque coelos attollit; cum eodem loquebar, cum laborabat, et postquam ei concessum erat, emergere ex inferiorum loco, sic ut veritas per vivam experientiam contestata sit. 1747, die 27 vel 28 Nov. </p>
