<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 894</h4><p>894. About the speech of angels of the inward heaven <sup>1</sup><p>Today angels spoke among themselves, for quite a while, but their speaking was not at all understandable to me. I perceived it only as a gentle, wave-like motion overhead, up and down. The spirits around me can also perceive the same thing, but can understand nothing.<p>Moreover, they also speak clearly amongst themselves, saying many things simultaneously in one connected utterance, which I could make out from the fact that many things were said on a certain quite lengthy subject, and it was done in a matter of moments, as has also happened several times before.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262 and footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 894</h4><p>894. CONCERNING THE SPEECH OF THE ANGELS OF THE INTERIOR HEAVEN <p>Today angels were speaking amongst themselves for some time, but their speech was not at all perceived by me; I only perceived it as a gentle undulation above the head, above and behind. The spirits around me can also perceive something similar, but can understand nothing. Moreover, they were speaking distinctly amongst themselves saying many things simultaneously in one complex. I could perceive this from the fact that many things were said concerning a certain very extensive subject; this was done in a moment, as has also happened several times before. </p>

De Loquela angelorum interioris coeli<p>Hodie inter se loquuti sunt angeli, satis diu, sed loquela eorum mihi nullatenus percepta est, modo percipiebatur mihi sicut lenis undulatio, supra caput, supra et retro; spiritus qui circum me, simile quoque percipere possunt, sed nihil intelligere; praeterea etiam distincte inter se loquuntur, et in complexu multa simul; quod percipere potui per id quod dicta sunt multa de quadam re admodum prolixa, quod intra momenta <sup>1</sup></p><p>factum est, sicut etiam prius, aliquoties.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
