<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1879</h4><p>1879. About those who live only on the outside<p>In a dream it was depicted to me as if in real life that I was somewhere else, namely, in Sweden, when yet I knew that I was in Amsterdam. It surprised me that I could be in both places, and thus appear before their eyes as though I were there, when yet I was here. This I also realized in the dream. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1879</h4><p>1879. CONCERNING THOSE WHO LIVE ONLY IN EXTERNALS. <p>It was vividly represented to me in sleep that I was in some other place, to wit, in Sweden, when yet I knew that I was at Amsterdam, which caused me much wonder that I could be in both places at once, and could appear before the eyes of others as being there when I was here. This fact, however, I detected in sleep. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1879 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1879. De iis qui in externis solum vivunt<p>In somnio repraesentatum mihi est, quasi ad vivum, quod alibi loci essem, nempe Sueciae, cum tamen scirem, quod essem Amstelodami, quod miratus quod potuissem esse utrinque, et sic apparere coram oculis eorum, quod ibi essem, cum tamen hic essem, hoc in somnio quoque detexi. </p>
