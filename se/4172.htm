<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4172</h4><p>4172. Someone was saying he has no goodness in himself, and can therefore not be saved. He was told that he ought to have the true faith that all goodness is from the Lord, and that thus he can be gifted with charity. This shows that the higher knowledge ought to precede, namely, that all good is from the Lord, and that without that higher knowledge, one is not gifted with charity. So the higher knowledge of truth precedes. 1749, 12 March. <sup>1</sup>He was further told that he can know that all good is from the Lord, but he cannot have faith so as really to acknowledge it, unless he has charity. From charity it can be acknowledged, never from faith without charity.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4172</h4><p>4172. A certain one said that he had in himself nothing good; and thus could not be saved. It was replied, that he ought to have a true faith that every good was from the Lord, and that thus he might be gifted with charity. It was hence evident that knowledge ought to precede, that is, [a knowledge] that all good is from the Lord, and that unless one has knowledge, he is not endowed with the charity of faith; thus the knowledge of truth precedes. - 1749, March 12. It was farther said that one could know that all good is from the Lord, but that he cannot have faith sincerely to acknowledge this, unless he has charity; from charity the acknowledgment may be made, but not from faith without charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4172 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4172. Quidam dicebat quod non habeat aliquod boni apud se, et ita non possit salvari, ei dictum quod veram fidem habere debeat, quod omne bonum a Domino, et sic is donari queat 279 280 charitate; inde constabat quod praecedere debeat cognitio, quod nempe omne bonum a Domino, et nisi cognitio, charitate fidei non donatur, ita praecedit cognitio veri. 1749, 12 Martius - . Dictum porro est, quod scire possit, quod a Domino omne bonum, sed non potest fidem habere, ut agnoscat, nisi habeat charitatem, ex charitate agnosci potest, nusquam ex fide absque charitate. </p>
