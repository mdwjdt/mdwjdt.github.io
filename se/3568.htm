<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3568</h4><p>3568. Those without faith cannot even name the Lord<p>It was granted me to hear and to realize that those not having faith cannot so much as name the Lord; when they were allowed to reflect on the fact that only to those having faith it is granted to name the Lord, they tried, but were not able. This surprised them, for they wanted to do this from their own power. However, when such a reflection is not allowed, then they were permitted to do so, as every person is. For to name the Lord from one's own power, is to take His name in vain, as we read in the first commandment of the decalogue; for which reason the Lord said that they should not swear by heaven. 1748, 14 Oct. Nor was a spirit able to name faith, no matter how he tried. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3568</h4><p>3568. THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN FAITH CANNOT EVEN NAME THE LORD.<p>It was given to hear and perceive that those who are not in faith cannot even name the Lord, but that it is granted to those only who are in faith to do it, and that only where reflection is given. They tried, but were unable, at which they wondered; for they desired it from their proprium. But when such reflection is not given, then it is lawful for them, as for every man. To name the Lord from the proprium, is to take his name in vain, as is read in the first precept of the Decalogue. Wherefore the Lord says they ought not to swear by heaven. - 1748, October 14. Nor can a spirit [who is not in faith] name faith, however he may attempt it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3568 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3568. Qui non in fide, quod ne Dominum quidem nominare possint<p>Datum audire et percipere, quod ii qui non in fide, Dominum ne quidem nominare possint, sed cum data iis esset reflexio, quod solum [iis] qui in fide nominare Dominum concedatur, tentabant, sed non potuerunt, quod mirati, nam ex proprio cupiebant: at vero cum talis reflexio non datur, tunc iis licuit, sicut homini cuicunque: ex proprio enim nominare Dominum, est in vanum nomen Ipsius sumere, ut legitur in praecepto primo decalogi; quare Dominus dixit, quod non jurare debeant per coelum. 1748, 14 Oct. Nec nominare potuit spiritus fidem, quamvis conatus. </p>
