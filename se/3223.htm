As he was standing thus, suddenly there flew out from him a small spirit like a little child, with a body like the human body, who, after he had come toward the higher regions, spoke with me, nor did I perceive anything evil. Then I spoke about the same one with spirits, [asking] who he was, and where the body had been left that appeared like a cast-off garment, whether any life remained in it, since the interiors had thus been separated. It was said that this little one who came from him was his inward spirit, attended by just so much of the earthly element as could be of service or compliant.<p>So the question was discussed whether or not all evil ones can thus come forth, and then come into heaven.

I then spoke, concerning the same, with spirits, [asking] who he was, and where [was] the body left which appeared like a cast-off garment: whether in this remained any life, inasmuch as interiors were thus separated. It was said that that little one which [came] from him was his interior spirit with whom so much of the natural [principle] followed as could have been serviceable or obedient. Wherefore it was asked [loquatum] whether or no all the evil can thus exist and so enter heaven; but it was said that this was contrary to order, or the laws of order, for a man to lose exteriors: also that such appear indeed [as] angels of the interior heaven, </p>

Nunc insinuatum, quod ea quae relicta apparent ut amictus, similiter repraesententur <sup>3</sup></p><p>apud eos qui angeli interiores fiunt, sicut mihi quondam repraesentatum [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3223/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2692" target=_top>2692-2693</a>] quod vestes relictae in oculo sinistro, ibi reconditae; sed [ex eo,] quod inde evocentur ordine ea, et naturalibus angelorum adjiciuntur, quae non obsequiosa sunt seu serva, inde fermentatio, et emissio e coelis, ut quoad ea quoque vastentur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has numnes<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has considerant<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has repraesentetur </p>
