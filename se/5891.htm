He followed there too, and talked with those who were there, but neither could they endure him. One or two of them went to a certain governor saying that it would be better if he were told to go elsewhere, because he was moved to mercy toward anyone at all and did not look into whether it was beneficial, but that they first look at the character of those on whom they are going to have mercy, and so see how they are going to show mercy discriminately. For this reason he was told by the governor that it would be better if he went away to another society where there would be those of a like nature and that there he would find his heavenly pleasure , which he did. He did not want to do wrong to others. </p>

He also withdrew thither, and mingled with those who were there; but they were not able to endure him. One or two of them went to a certain governor, saying, that it was better that he be told to go somewhere else, because his compassion was moved towards everyone whatever, and he did not inquire whether it was of use; but that they see, first, of what quality those are to whom they are to extend pity, and thus in what manner they shall pity them, with discrimination. In consequence of this, he was told by the governor that it would be better for him to go away to some other society where were those like him, and that he would there enjoy the delight of his own heaven; which, also, he did. He had no wish to harm others. </p>
