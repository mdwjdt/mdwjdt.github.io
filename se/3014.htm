<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3014</h4><p>3014. Spirits do not have a life unless they are permitted the things that they desire<p>I realized they were discussing among themselves the fact that the life of spirits consists in their desires, without which they would not live, consequently could not mix with others. This was also demonstrated to them in various ways that came only vaguely to my perception, and they acknowledged it, that is, that if each one were not permitted what meets with their desire, they would not be able to go on among others, thus not be able to live. From this one may conclude that the Lord bends them each through their own desires. On another occasion earlier [see <a href="2194.htm">2194</a> ff., 2880] I spoke with them about the fact that their life consists in being so permitted, and that otherwise, unless they were permitted to act according to their fantasies, they would not be able to live. 1748, 2 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3014</h4><p>3014. THAT SPIRITS DO NOT HAVE LIFE UNLESS THEY ARE PERMITTED THOSE THINGS WHICH THEY DESIRE. <p>I perceived that they were discussing [agerent] among themselves concerning this; that the life of spirits consists in their cupidities, without which they could not live, therefore could not be present among others; which was also shown them by various things which came more obscurely to my perception; and they acknowledged that if each one was not permitted such as agrees with his cupidity, that they could not subsist amongst others, thus could not live; from which it may be concluded, that the Lord bends everyone by means of his cupidities. I have previously spoken with them on other occasions [alioquin] concerning this, that their life consists in being permitted these things, and that otherwise they could not live, unless permitted to do according to phantasies. - 1748, September 2. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3014 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3014. Quod spiritus non habeant vitam, nisi permittantur ea, quae cupiunt<p>Percepi, quod inter se agerent de eo, quod vita spirituum consistat in eorum cupiditatibus, sine quibus non viverent, proinde non possent interesse aliis, quod quoque iis ostensum per varia, quae ad meam perceptionem obscurius veniebant, et quod agnoscebant, [nempe] si non permitteretur cuique tale quod cupiditati eorum congruit, quod non possent subsistere inter alios, ita nec vivere, ex quo concludi potest, quod Dominus flectat eos per cupiditates suas quemvis; alioquin cum iis prius [cf. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3014/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2880" target=_top>2880</a>] loquutus sum de eo, quod vita eorum consistat in eo, ut iis permittatur, et quod alioquin, nisi secundum phantasias permitteretur facere, quod non possent vivere. 1748, 2 Sept. <sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;vide annotationem ad 3013 </p>
