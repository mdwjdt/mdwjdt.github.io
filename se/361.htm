<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第361节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>361.当每日为天国祷告，因此，何谓“每日”。在主祷文中，“每日”表示每时每刻，这一点可通过经历来证实，从而得以理解。也就是说，被指示永恒幸福的人以为他们立刻被带入天堂；因此，那些从试探当中走出来的人必成为天国的永恒继承者；那些在葡萄园中劳苦的人也以为他们当拥有永恒的救恩，他们因此将救恩归于自己。然而，指示给他们的，恰恰是反面，即：他们再次因诅咒而陷入危机、试探、危险等等中。由此可以得出结论，“每日”表示在连续事物中的每时每刻，一个接着一个；但在它们的同步事物中，这一系列时刻就变成了弥赛亚神的一种不间断的荣耀，以致这些时刻都是连续的，没有任何间隔。因此，他们对幸福的状态拥有一种内在感觉，不断从弥赛亚神接受这些就是他们的分。（1747年12月17日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 361</h4><p>361. Daily one should pray for the heavenly kingdom - and thus, What is meant by "daily".<p>By "daily" in the Lord's Prayer is meant every moment, and this can be confirmed by experience, and thus understood.<p>For those to whom eternal happiness has been shown believe they have been at once transferred to heaven, thus that they, having come out of temptations, must be eternal heirs of the Kingdom - they who have labored in the vineyard and believed they were entitled to eternal salvation, which they then claim as theirs. Yet just the opposite was shown, namely that they were again plunged into crises, temptations, dangers of damnation, and the like.<p>One may conclude from this that "daily" means at each moment in sequence, one after another, but when in their order one within another, this [sequence of moments] is turned into an uninterrupted glorification of God the Messiah, so that the moments are continuous, without any division. Hence they have an inner sense of [states of] happiness, and it is their portion to receive these constantly from God the Messiah. 1747, the 17th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 361</h4><p>361. THAT WE SHOULD PRAY DAILY FOR THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM: AND THUS WHAT IS MEANT BY "DAILY" <p>By "daily" in the Lord's prayer is meant every moment, which can be confirmed by experience, and thus be understood; namely, that those to whom eternal happiness is shown suppose that they have been at once carried away into heaven; so those who have come out of temptations suppose that thus they have become the eternal heirs of the Kingdom; those who have labored in the vineyard also suppose that thus they ought to have eternal salvation, which they hence attribute to themselves. The contrary, however, is shown to them, namely, that they are again cast into dangers, into temptations, into perils and the like, on account of damnation. Hence it can be concluded, that "daily" signifies every moment in things successive, but in their simultaneous things, however, this is changed into a continuous glorification of God Messiah, so that the moments are continuous without differentiation; hence their perception and felicities and their [belief] that they continually receive this from God Messiah. 1747, Dec. 17. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The entry in the Index (s.v. Felicitas) is: "What daily' signifies in the Lord's Prayer. That those who trust in themselves are admitted into heaven, and afterwards let down into damnation; this takes place in the beginning for a longer period of time, and afterwards they are turned into shorter periods; hence their happiness together with perception." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 361 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>361. Quod quotidie supplicandum de regno coelesti et sic quid "quotidie"<p>Per "quotidie" in oratione Dominica intelligitur omne momentum, quod experientia confirmari potest, et sic intelligi, nempe quod quibus felicitas aeterna ostensa est, ii putant, quod illico translati sint in coelum, sic qui a tentationibus venerunt, quod sic aeterni haeredes Regni forent, qui laborarunt in vinea, et putarunt sic deberi iis aeternam salutem, quam sibi inde attribuunt, cum tamen contrarium ostensum est, nempe quod iterum in discrimina conjecti sint, in tentationes, in pericula pro damnatione, et similia: inde concludi potest, quod "quotidie" significet omne momentum in successivis, at vero in eorum simultaneis, vertitur id in continuam glorificationem Dei Messiae, sic ut momenta sint continua, absque discrimine, inde [iis] perceptio et felicitates, et eorum quod jugiter id accipiant a Deo Messia. 1747, die 17 Dec. </p>
