<p>310.刚才所写的这些事通过大量活生生的经历被指示给我。因为我被领到更内层天堂的居所，进入其中一个我甚至能感觉到的居所。此外，天使告诉我说，有时会有不和谐，有时会有和谐。这是因为我的心智状态存在变化，以及与我同在的灵人所进行的运作，它们混在一起，使觉知发生变化。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 310</h4><p>310. These things just written were shown to me by much actual experience. For I was conducted into habitations of the very inward heaven, and I came into one of them where I could even sense, without being told by the angels, at one moment that there was discordance, but at another that there was harmony. This was because there were changes in my state [of mind], as well as the workings of certain [spirits] present, which mixed in and varied the perception. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 310</h4><p>310. The things that have just been written were shown me by much living experience: for I was led into the habitations of the more interior heaven and I came into one where I could perceive (and moreover, it was told me by the angels) that sometimes there was disagreement, and sometimes agreement, because there were changes of state; and also there were the operations of certain spirits with me, which intermingled themselves and varied the perception. </p>
