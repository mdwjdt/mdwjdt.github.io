<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2838</h4><p>2838. to the earthly mind in those who had attributed everything to themselves in bodily life and had supposed they guided themselves. It is otherwise with those who had been guided by the Lord.<p>I spoke with spirits about this, for some are so shrewd and cunning that they are much more cunning than in their bodily life. But that cunning is a natural quality they had acquired, a kind of instinct, which they do not want to admit because they imagine they are still in their body, not knowing that this is not the case, because when in the stream of some natural faculty, they no longer reflect, Where does this come from, or Why is this, but think, So things have [always] been. 1748, 16 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2838</h4><p>2838. In [apud] those who had attributed all things to self, in the life of the body, and have supposed that they have led themselves. It is otherwise with those who are led by the Lord. I spoke with spirits concerning this, for so shrewd and cunning are some, that they are much more cunning than in the life of the body; but that cunning is the natural [principle] which they had acquired; thus a certain instinct, which they are unwilling to admit, because they suppose themselves to be still in their bodies, and do not know other than that matters are similarly circumstanced, inasmuch as when they are in any natural faculty they no longer reflect, whence is this, or why is this. They suppose [that] so it has been. - 1748, August 16. </p>
