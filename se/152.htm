<p>152.关于灵人的普遍气场。要明白何为灵人的普遍气场，以及灵人如何影响人的心智，是很困难的，除非知道灵人如何清清楚楚地被分为属和种，其形成气场的活动如何回应人的每一个思维和想象，并以这种方式行动。相对于人的心智，灵人的普遍气场就像空气，也就是粗糙的大气；相对于听觉，则好比以太，或与视觉有关的纯净大气；或如同与上空晴朗宁静区域相比之下包围大地的密云。<p>(1)灵人的气场现在如此败坏，以致凡从内层天堂流入他们的气场，也 就是构成第三层天堂之物都被扭曲变形，导致所交流的东西根本不为人知；每一个和一切信息都以完全相反的意义流入人的头脑。<p>(2)这就是当今的这个气场，它一直在增长，并且朝着它将要被驱散之时的末日增长。但在上古时代，它不是这样。这也是为何若非以一种非同寻常的方式，如今不再像古时那样有启示，以及为何与天堂没有像以前那样的交流的原因。<p>(3)有几个小时的时间，我一直被指示这普遍气场如何进入人的心智；事实上，当这种事被允许时，我丝毫不能阻止他们拿走我的思想，并征服我。当灵人得到行动的机会时，这就是今日该气场的力量。<p>(4)整个气场与天使的努力完全对立；天使都属于弥赛亚神，他们的能力也在增长，以便他们能征服它。<p>(5)如果我将他们被允许通过幻觉行事时所展现的可憎污秽之物讲述出来，那会令人震惊不已。我宁愿忽略过去，因为说出来实在可怕；它们无非是污秽。<p>(6)第三层级的天使也能处于这个气场，但他们因被天使天堂所掌管，故决不会受到伤害。<p>(7)我所观察到的值得一提的事是，有时，我听见一个灵人正与我说话，他却突然间变了。我现在得以知道，他被那普遍气场抢走了，也就是说，他被迫照着该气场的活动说话。我还发现更多的事，只是不记得了，因为这个气场会夺走他们所不喜悦的任何真理与良善。不过，如果弥赛亚神觉得合适，关于这个普遍气场，无论总体还是细节，我会在别的地方讲得更详细。<p>(8)这个普遍气场好比以太大气，因为它会将单个物体，如草地或田野，将它们的细节，连同它们的形式和形状，都传到眼睛，甚至传到上千或上万只眼睛。这个气场便以这种方式将事物清晰传到人的每一个思维、推理和幻想，因为它就在自然界里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 152</h4><p>152. About the collective [energy] field of spirits<p>It is certainly difficult to understand what the collective field of spirits is, and what their impact upon human minds is, without being informed how spirits are differentiated most distinctly into kinds and species, and how their energy, which creates that field, responds to, and thus guides, every single thought and mental image in a human being.<p>[The relation of human minds to] the collective field of spirits is no different from that of the air, which is the grosser atmosphere and related to hearing, compared to the ether or purer atmosphere related to sight; or the dense clouds around the earth compared to the clear and serene region up above.<p>1. ) The [energy] field of spirits is now so corrupted, that whatever flows from the more inward heaven into their realm, which constitutes the third heaven, <sup>1</sup>becomes so distorted that whatever [is communicated] does not become known at all, but all and the least messages stream into human minds with an entirely opposite content.<p>2. ) Such is that field at this day, and so it has been growing and is growing toward the last day, when it will be dispersed. But in most ancient times, it was not so. It is also because of this field that revelations cannot come forth today as they did in ancient times, except by an extraordinary way, and that there is no such communication with the heavens as there once was.<p>3. ) For a period of some hours I was shown how the collective field operates into human minds, and in fact, when it was allowed, how I was not in the least able to stop them from taking away my thought, and from prevailing - such is the strength of that field today, when spirits are given the power to act.<p>4. ) The whole field utterly opposes the angels' endeavors; and the power of the angels, who all belong to God the Messiah, is increased so that they are able to overcome.<p>5. ) Astounding things would emerge if I should tell what filthy objects they portray when they are allowed to work by fantasies - which I would rather pass by, because it would be shocking to tell; they are nothing less than filthy.<p>6. ) Angels of the third level <sup>2</sup>can also be in that same realm, and because they are governed by the heaven of angels, they cannot be hurt at all.<p>7. ) A fact I have found noteworthy was that at times, I have heard a spirit speaking with me, and he was abruptly removed. Now I have been allowed to learn that he was snatched away by the collective field, that is, compelled to speak in accord with the field's action. I observed still more things that have slipped from my memory: for that field takes away whatever truth and goodness they find to be the most unpleasant. But if God the Messiah sees fit, [I will speak] more fully elsewhere about this collective field, in general and in details. 1747, the 14th day of September (old calendar).<p>8. ) The collective field can be compared with the ethereal atmosphere, in that this conveys to the eye the individual objects, like those on streets and in the countryside, in all the details of their forms and shapes - indeed, to a thousand eyes at the same time, or even tens of thousands - and in this way, to each of a person's thoughts, reasonings and fantasies individually. [The comparison is valid,] for [the collective field] lies inside of nature.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. in descending order.<br><br>2.&nbsp;I.e. third in a descending order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 152</h4><p>152. <sup>1</sup>CONCERNING THE GENERAL SPHERE OF SPIRITS <p>It is indeed difficult to understand what the general sphere of spirits is and the activity of spirits on human minds, unless there be given the knowledge of how they are most distinctly divided into genera and species, and that their activity, which forms the sphere, responds to each thought and imagination of man, and acts in this way. The general sphere of spirits is comparatively like the air or grosser atmosphere, which is that of hearing, to the ether or purer atmosphere, which is that of sight; or as dense clouds about the earth, respectively to the clear and serene region above. <p>(1) The sphere of spirits is now so perverse that when anything whatever is let down from the more interior heaven into that sphere, which constitutes the third heaven, it is so perverted that nothing is known, but each and all things inflow into human minds in an entirely contrary sense. <p>(2) Such is that sphere at this day, and it has so increased and is increasing until the last day when it will be dissipated. But yet in the most ancient times it was not so. This also is the reason why there can no longer be revelations at this day as in days of old, except in an extraordinary manner, and why there is not such communication with the heavens as formerly. <p>(3) For several hours it was shown me how the general sphere operates into human minds, and indeed that when it was permitted I could by no means resist spirits taking away my thoughts, and overpowering me. Such is the power of that sphere at this day when the opportunity of acting is given to spirits. <p>(4) The whole sphere is utterly opposed to those things which the angels intend; and the power of the angels, who all belong to God Messiah, is increased so that they are able to overcome it. <p>(5) It would be astonishing were I to relate what abominable objects they represent when they are permitted to act by phantasies, which I would rather pass over because it would be horrible to tell; they are nothing else than abominable. <p>(6) Angels of the third degree can also be in the same sphere, but because they are ruled by the heaven of angels they can in no wise be injured.<p>(7) It was worthy of my observation that sometimes I heard a spirit speaking with me, and in a moment he was changed. It is now given me to know that he was snatched away by the general sphere, that is, compelled to speak according to the activity of that sphere. Still more things were observed which have escaped my memory, for that sphere takes away whatever is true and good which is especially displeasing to them. But God Messiah deeming it worthy, this general sphere will be treated more fully elsewhere, in general and in its particulars. 1747. Sept. 14, o.s. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For nos. 149-151, see after n, <a href="../se/205.htm">205</a>. For n. 152, see after n, <a href="../se/199.htm">199</a>. See also Special Preface, p. ix. <p>[152a.] The general sphere can be compared to the ethereal atmosphere in that it reflects the single objects, as of a meadow or field, in their details, together with their forms and figures, to the eye, and even to a thousand or ten thousand eyes at the same time. So [this sphere reflects things] distinctly to the single thoughts, reasonings, and phantasies of man, for this sphere is within nature. </p>

De sphaera spirituum communi<p>Difficile quidem est intelligere, quid sphaera communis <sup>1</sup></p><p>spirituum, et eorum activitas in mentes humanas, nisi datum esset scire, quomodo <sup>2</sup></p><p>spiritus in genera et species distinctissime sint divisi, et quod activitas eorum, quae sphaeram format, cuicunque cogitationi et imaginationi hominis respondeat, et sic agat, sphaera spirituum communis non aliter se comparative habet, ac aer, qui est crassior atmosphaera, quae est auditus, ad aetherem seu atmosphaeram puriorem, quae est visus, aut sicut nimbi circa terram, densi, respective ad claram et serenam regionem superne.<p>1) Spirituum sphaera nunc tam perversa est, ut quicquid usquam a coelo intimiori [influit] in eorum sphaeram, quae constituit coelum tertium {a}, ita pervertatur, ut nihil sciatur, sed omnia et singula prorsus contrario sensu influant in mentes humanas.<p>2) Talis est ea sphaera hodie, et sic crevit crescitque ad ultimum diem, dum dissipabitur; at vero in antiquissimis temporibus non item: haec etiam causa est, quod revelationes hodie sicut antiquitus nequeant existere, nisi per modum extraordinarium, et quod non talis sit communicatio coelorum ac olim.<p>3) Per aliquot horas mihi ostensum est, quomodo sphaera communis operatur in mentes humanas, et quidem etiam dum permittebatur, quod nequicquam potuissem resistere, quin auferrent cogitationem, ac praevalerent, talis est istius sphaerae valor, hodie, dum iis datur copia agendi.<p>4) Tota sphaera prorsus repugnat iis, quae intendunt angeli, et angelorum, qui sunt omnes Dei Messiae, potentia augetur, ut vincere possint.<p>5) Mira erunt si narrarem, quam foeda objecta, dum phantasiis permittitur iis agere, repraesentent, quae quia horror est dicere, velim potius praeterire, nihil nisi quam foeda sunt.<p>6) Angeli tertii {b} gradus etiam possunt esse in eadem sphaera, sed ii quia a coelo angelorum reguntur, nihil possunt laedi.<p>7) Observatu mihi dignum fuit, quod quandoque audiverim spiritum mecum loquentem, et momento mutatum, nunc hoc datum est mihi cognoscere, quod is abreptus sit a sphaera communi, hoc est, coactus loqui secundum activitatem sphaerae: plura adhuc observata sunt, quae exciderunt memoria, nam aufert quicquid verum et bonum est, quod maxime iis displicet: sed dignante Deo Messia, de sphaera hac communi, in genere et in suis speciebus alibi plenius. 1747, die 14 Sept. st. v. <p>8) Comparari potest sphaera communis cum atmosphaera aetherea, quod haec reflectat objecta singula, sicut pratorum, et agrorum, in singularibus cum suis formis et figuris, ad oculum, et quidem ad mille oculos simul, vel si sint myriades, ita ad singula cogitata, ratiocinia <sup>3</sup></p><p>, et phantasias hominis distincte, nam intra naturam est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
