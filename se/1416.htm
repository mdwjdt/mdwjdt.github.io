<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1416</h4><p>1416. They came to me, and they explored everything that was in my memory, and when they aroused various places where I had been, including streets, houses, churches, and the like, they did not at all want to know about them, but immediately they cleverly and skillfully aroused everything done in those places. Everything that had happened while I was there, they brought out, not dwelling on the appearance of the place, house, church, or other in the category of place.<p>It is like what normally happens in a person, that when one recalls a place to memory, at once things which had happened there come to mind. Thus events more or less associated with the places are attached to the memory, but not within it, so that those spirits would cleverly pass over the places, and immediately bring out the events, which they enjoyed.<p>This is just what I was told, namely, that they are not allowed to gaze at places, nor material, nor therefore bodily and worldly things, but must pass over them at once and look only at real events.<p>Because of this I was later able to realize that they were from a different earth, because they did not like to pay attention to bodily, worldly things and the like, but only to things done. And because it is different on our earth, where people enjoy bodily, worldly things and such, therefore they were also faster than our spirits, and ran quickly through [my memory]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1416</h4><p>1416. They came to me and searched into those things which were in my memory, and when the various places where I had been - the streets, houses, churches and the like - were brought forth, they did not want to know about them, but at once skillfully and dexterously called forth what had been done in those places. So they called forth everything that had happened when I was there, but did not dwell upon the appearance of the place, the house, the church, and like things which relate to place. This is usually the case with man, so that when a place is remembered the things that happened there are at once recalled; thus in man the things, as it were, connected with places are wont to be present to the memory but are not within it. These spirits, therefore, skillfully passed over the places, and at once aroused the things with which they were delighted. It was also said that it is not granted them to regard places, nor material and consequently corporeal and worldly things, but they immediately pass over such things and attend only to those which are real. Hence it could later be observed that they were from another earth, because they were not willing to attend to worldly, corporeal and similar things, but only to things done. Since it is otherwise on our earth, where men are delighted with corporeal, worldly and like things, they were therefore more ready than our spirits, and quickly ran through [the things in my memory]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1416 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1416. Venerunt ad me; et inquisiverunt ea, quae in memoria mea essent, cumque excitarentur loca, varia, ubi fueram, tum plateae <sup>1</sup></p><p>, domus, templa et similia, nusquam volebant ea scire, sed sollerter et dextre statim excitabant ea, quae facta sunt in locis istis, sic ut quaecunque contigerint <sup>2</sup></p><p>, cum ibi fuissem, id excitabant, non morantes circa aspectum loci, domus, templi, et similium, quae ad loca pertinent; sicut solet fieri in homine, quod dum locus in memoriam venit, illico res <sup>3</sup></p><p>, quae ibi accidere, subeunt, sic in homine res quasi locis adjunctae solent memoriae adesse, non inesse, quare isti spiritus solerter praeteribant loca, et statim res excitabant, quibus delectabantur; quod etiam dicebatur, [erat,] quod iis non concessum sit loca, nec materialia, proinde non corporea, et mundana spectare, sed ea praeterire illico, sed solum quae realia sunt; inde postea animadverti potuit, quod ex alia tellure essent, quia nullis corporeis, mundanis, et similibus voluerunt attendere, sed solum factis, et quia aliter in nostra tellure, qui delectantur corporeis, mundanis, et similibus, ideo quoque erant promptiores nostris spiritibus; et celeriter percurrebant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has contingerint<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has solent res </p>
