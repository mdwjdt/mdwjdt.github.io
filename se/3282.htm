When they perceived his life, from which they said they had their life, then they confessed that it was he. So he spoke with them, saying that they can be made still better. They therefore adore such a bearded one, but they recognize him from his life. I was given to realize that there are many of that sort, and in fact, that all such spirits who are able to pour life like that into them, they think to be their god. This was mentioned to them. </p>

So that he entered by their thought, thus by the speech of ideas, completely into their interior life, which was also granted me to perceive; so that I then [saw] that [it was] their inmost life]. He said that he was not the Supreme. When they perceived his life from whom they said they have their life, they then confessed that it was he; so I spoke with them [saying] that they can be rendered still better: therefore they worship such a bearded [man] but recognize him from [his] life. It was granted to perceive that there are many [of such a sort]: yea, that they suppose everyone who is such as to be able to infuse the like life in them to be their god. This was said to them. </p>
