<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3033</h4><p>3033. On Inflow<p>When I was dealing with the subject of general inflow and of inflow in particular into each human being, and the fact that every spirit and angel is a center of inflowings such that myriads of myriads stream into every mental image that a person on earth or a spirit thinks of as simple or single, then by lofty spiritual mental images it was granted to some who were capable of receiving them to understand that this is the case. Among them were both Mohammeds, who now say that they had grasped it so well that they had become thoroughly convinced that this is the case, and that no person on earth can ever grasp it who supposes an idea to be something simple, nor can any spirit. Hence they cannot grasp it as long as heaven is not open to the person or spirit so that such inner sight can be imparted to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3033</h4><p>3033. CONCERNING INFLUX <p>(When I treated [ageretur] concerning general and special influx into everyone whatever; also, that every spirit and angel whatever, is a center of influxes, so that myriads of myriads inflow into every idea, which man and spirit supposes a simple [one] or individual [unicam]; then was it granted to certain who were capable of receiving, to perceive by means of sublime [exalted] spiritual ideas, that the matter is so. Amongst these were both Mohammeds, who now say that they have perceived it so as to have become wholly persuaded that the matter is so, and that no man, nor likewise any spirit, who supposes an idea to be simple, can even apprehend it [the matter]; therefore cannot apprehend so long as heaven is not opened to man and spirit, so that such perception may be infused into them. </p>

De influxu<p>Cum ageretur de influxu communi, et in specie in unumquemvis, tum quod unusquisque spiritus et angelus sit centrum influxuum, ita quod myriadum myriades influant in unamquamvis ideam, quam homo et spiritus putat simplicem, seu unicam, tunc <sup>1</sup></p><p>per ideas spirituales sublimes dabatur quibusdam, qui capaces essent recipiendi, percipere quod ita se res habeat, inter quos erat uterque Mahumed; qui dicunt nunc se percepisse ita, ut prorsus persuasi facti sint, quod ita se res habeat, et quod homo nusquam possit id capere, cum putat ideam esse simplicem, sicut nec quidam spiritus; proinde non capere possunt, quamdiu homini et spiritui coelum non apertum est, ut talis perceptio iis possit infundi.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has unicam; tunc </p>
