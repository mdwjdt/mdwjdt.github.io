<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4180</h4><p>4180. About the journeys of spirits<p>When spirits are crossing over from a society, through other societies, to their own, from which they are away, then it seems to them that they are on a journey from place to place. This was just now experienced by me, in the provinces of the loins, the feet, the soles, where they spoke, saying yes to one place, or there they do not wish to stay, and so they go on, or seem to themselves to go on, as if they were traveling, when yet these are only changes of society. 1749, 26 Mar. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4180</h4><p>4180. CONCERNING THE JOURNEYING OF SPIRITS.<p>When spirits pass from societies to societies and so onwards to their own, they seem to themselves to proceed on a journey, and to come to other and other places, which is now also perceived by me, especially in conversing with spirits in the province of the loins, of the feet, of the soles of the feet, where they said they could not abide, and so go on or seem to themselves to go on, as if on a journey, when yet it is a mere change of societies. - 1749, March 26. </p>

De profectione spirituum<p>Cum spiritus transeunt a societate per societates, ad suam, e qua distant, tunc videntur sibi proficisci, et venire in alia et alia loca, hoc nunc quoque perceptum a me, in provinciis lumborum, pedum, plantae, ubi loquuti, quod ibi ita, ibi morari nequeant, et sic pergunt, seu pergere sibi videntur, quasi proficisci, cum solum sunt mutationes societatis. 1749, 26 Mart. </p>
