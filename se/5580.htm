<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5580</h4><p>5580. It was said to me also that they had seen spiritual writing, and they did understand this according to the spiritual meaning, but yet at the same time they understood other things from the bends on the individual letters alone, at which those who are spiritual were amazed. Because they had not understood, certain letters were shown to me. They were only lines curved in various forms, almost as with certain eastern peoples. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5580</h4><p>5580. I was told, also, that they saw the spiritual writing, and indeed understood it according to its spiritual meaning; but, yet, [they understood,] at the same time, other things from the inflections of the syllables alone, which the spiritual angels wondered at and which they did not understand. A certain syllable was shown me; there were only curvatures, in various forms, almost as with certain Orientals. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5580 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5580. Dicebatur etiam mihi quod viderint scripturam spiritualem, et hanc quidem intellexerint, secundum sensum spiritualem, sed usque simul alia ex solis syllabarum inflexionibus, quod spirituales mirati. Quod illi non intellexerunt, ostensae mihi quaedam syllabae, erant modo curvaturae in varias formas, paene sicut apud quosdam orientales. </p>
