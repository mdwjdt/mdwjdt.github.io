<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3913</h4><p>3913. that they are scarcely aware or conscious of themselves, and they then serve as bones, into whom other spirits can flow. But because they had been of this nature, and of this character, they were able to intercept the persuasions of the people before the flood, and immersing them in themselves, to extinguish or to moderate them, to prevent them from entering into the brain and affect it with cold, and thus injure it; for they are the interceptors of the dreadful persuasions of the antediluvians, just as are the bones of the skull, which are of the same substance as the tunics of the brain, which weaken into bones and defend [the brain] from injuries - just as ground up scorpions, because they are of that nature, imbibe the poison, thereby protecting others from dying as a result of the bites of other scorpions. What remains with those spirits is that they are lewd and have lewdness as their goal. 1748, 9 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3913</h4><p>3913. But because these also were such and of such a genius [indoles], they were capable of receiving the persuasions of the antediluvians and [yet] of extinguishing their persuasions when poured forth upon them, or of moderating them so that they should not enter into the cerebrum and affect it with cold and thus injure it; for such [spirits] are recipient of direful persuasions, as they are the bones of the cranium, which are of the same substance with the tunics of the brain, yet growing into bones and defending [the other parts] from injuries; just as bruised scorpions, because of that nature, imbibe poison, and thus protect others from the danger of dying by the bites of other scorpions. As to what remains among them, it is to be said, that they are lascivious, and that they have lasciviousness for an end. - 1748, November 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3913 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3913. quod vix sui scii, sensibiles seu conscii, et sic inserviant pro ossibus, in quos influere possunt alii spiritus. Sed quia tales quoque fuerunt, et ex tali indole, sunt tales, ut persuasiones antediluvianorum possint recipere, et immersas sibi exstinguere, aut temperare ut non intrent in cerebrum, et gelu id afficiant, et sic noceant, nam talia sunt recipientia persuasionum dirarum, sicut cranii ossa sunt, quae ex substantia eadem cum cerebri tunicis, usque in ossa fatiscunt, et ab insultibus defendunt: sicut etiam scorpiones commoliti, quia ejus naturae sunt, imbibunt venenum, et tutantur sic alios, ne moriantur ab aliorum scorpionum morsibus: quod apud eos remanet est, quod sint lascivi, pro fine habentes lasciviam. 1748, 9 Nov. </p>
