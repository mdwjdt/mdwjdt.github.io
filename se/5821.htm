<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5821</h4><p>5821. The ordering of the heavens, the last judgment<p>Lastly the heavens were arranged in order: <p>1) those were brought forward who thought about what is Divine in the Lord, their ideas were opened, and they were separated into three classes: <p>2) Those who [thought] similarly about His union with the Father. <p>3) Those who, when they thought about the Lord, had thought only about His human nature and not at all about the Divine [in Him], although they knew, still they had not thought about it. <p>4) Those who had thought of three persons of divine nature and who were hostile toward all who did not believe the same as they; those in particular were separated too; and so on; for the most important of all is to have an idea of the Divine; from this arises conjunction with heaven, and salvation. <p>5) Then those who only acknowledged the Father. They were perceived as having no God and were banished from heaven. <p>6) Those who did not believe the Lord existed from eternity, but was born His Son. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5821</h4><p>5821. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE HEAVENS IN ORDER. THE LAST JUDGMENT. <p>Finally, the heavens were arranged in order. <p>(1) Those were led forth who thought of the Lord's Divine, and whose ideas were open, and they were distinguished into classes. <p>(2) In like manner, those who thought of His union with the Father. <p>(3) Those who, when thinking of the Lord, thought only of His Human and not at all of His Divine: although they knew, yet did not think upon it. <p>(4) Those who thought of three Persons of the Divinity, and were enraged against all who did not believe similarly to themselves: these, too, were distinguished into classes; and so forth; - for the chief thing of all is to have the idea of His Divine: hence is conjunction with heaven, and salvation. <p>(5) Next, those who acknowledged the Father only were perceived as having no God, and were rejected outside of heaven. <p>(6) Those who did not believe the Lord to have been from eternity, but only His [i.e. God's] born Son. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5821 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5821. Ordinatio coelorum, ultimum judicium<p>Ultimo ordinati sunt coeli;<p>1) producebantur illi qui de Domini Divino cogitaverunt, quorum ideae apertae sunt, et distincti in classes.<p>2) Qui de Ipsius unione cum Patre, similiter.<p>3) Qui solum cum de Domino cogitaverunt de humano Ipsius et nihil de Divino, tametsi noverunt, usque non de eo cogitaverunt.<p>4) Qui tres personas divinitatis cogitaverunt, et infensi fuerunt contra omnes, qui non similiter ac illi crediderunt, hi quoque in specie distincti sunt; et sic porro; nam omnium primum est ideam Divini sui habere, inde conjunctio cum coelo, et salus.<p>5) Tum qui solum Patrem agnoverunt, illi percepti sicut absque Deo, et extra coelum rejecti.<p>6) Qui non crediderunt Dominum ab aeterno, sed natum Filium Ipsius. </p>
