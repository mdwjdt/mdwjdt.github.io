<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>273.关于那些从寒冷之地的砍柴人当中被提升上来的人（续）。后来我与那些从寒冷之地被提升上来的人交谈。有许多人后来被提升上来，按照他们的说法，被提升到光中。实际上，他们是那些以好行为而自我称义，将救恩的果效或能力归因于它们的人。至于弥赛亚神的公义或功德，他们只是将它视为一个他们应当效法的榜样。殊不知，唯独祂为所有人的缘故而成为公义。他们被提升之后，就进入更高的居所，在那里被教导他们被关在那个寒冷之地并不断劳碌的原因。在那里，他们觉得自己似乎穿上了闪亮的白衣，因为在他们看来就是这样；事实上，其生命的形像就是如此从他们所获得的品性而来。此外，他们还在其它事上接受教导。他们迫不及待地接受教导，尽管一开始仍有从他们之前的幻觉而来的某种东西粘附在他们身上；他们畅所欲言说，他们最想摆脱这种东西。这些话是当着他们的面写的。（1747年11月29日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 273</h4><p>273. Continuation about those who were raised up from among the wood-cutters in the cold place<p>With those who were raised up from the cold place, I spoke later on. Many were also raised up afterwards, and, as they say, into the light. Actually, they are people who have been selfrighteous about good deeds, and have attributed to them the power of salvation. As for the righteousness or merit of God the Messiah, they have regarded it only as a kind of example, which they should follow, not [aware] that He Alone became righteousness for the sake of all.<p>After they were elevated, they came into a higher habitation, and were there instructed about the reason why they were kept in that cold place and in continuous labor; and there they seemed to themselves to be clothed in shining white garments, for so it appeared to them, because thus the imagery of their lives follows from their acquired character. They were also instructed in other matters about which they avidly received teaching, though something still persists with them at the beginning from their former fantasy, of which they say they desire most eagerly to rid themselves. These words were written in their presence. 1747, the 29th day of November. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 273</h4><p>273. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THOSE OF THE WOOD-CUTTERS IN THE COLD PLACE WHO WERE RAISED UP <p>I afterwards spoke with those who were raised up out of that cold place. Many also were later elevated into the light, as they say. For they are those who have placed justice in works, and attributed the efficacy of salvation to them. As to the justice or merit of God Messiah, they regarded it only as a kind of example which they should follow, not that He alone was made justice for all. After they were raised up, they came into a certain superior habitation and were there instructed as to the cause of their being held in that cold place and in continual labor. There they also appeared to themselves to be clothed in shining white cloaks, for so it seemed to them, because their imaginative life thus follows from their acquired nature. In addition, there were other things in which also they were instructed. They receive the teaching eagerly, although at first something still inheres from the former phantasy, which they say most freely, they long for the will to put off. These things were written in their presence. 1747, Nov. 29. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 273 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>273. Continuatione de iis qui elevati sunt ex lignariis in loco frigido<p>Cum iis qui elevati sunt e loco frigido, postea loquutus sum, plures etiam postea, elevati sunt, ac ut dicunt in lucem, sunt enim ii qui in operibus posuerunt justitiam, ac tribuerunt iis efficaciam salvationis; quod Dei Messiae justitiam seu meritum attinet, spectarunt modo ut quoddam exemplum, quod sequerentur, non quod Ipse Solus pro omnibus justitia factus; postquam elevati sunt, in superiorem quandam mansionem venerunt, ac ibi instructi de causa quod in loco isto frigido inque labore continuo tenerentur, ac ibi sibi videbantur indui amiculis candidis, ita enim sibi videbantur, quia eorum vitae imaginativae, ex comparata indole, ita consequuntur, praeter alia, in quibus etiam instructi sunt, [de quibus] arripuerunt doctrinam. quamvis usque inhaeret aliquid in principio a phantasia priori, quam exuere velle se libentissime dicunt desiderare. Haec in praesentia eorum scripta sunt. 1747, die 29 Nov. </p>
