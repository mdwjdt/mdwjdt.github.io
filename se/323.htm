<p>323.灵人能闻到气味，这些气味对应于已死之人的属灵生命。这是一件不寻常的事：肉身生命结束后，如果允许的话，死者能清晰、明显地闻到某个已死之人的品质；对那些过着邪恶生活的人来说，那时所散发的气味和尸体所散发的一样难闻，以至于灵人们无法忍受他们的靠近。他们告诉我说，这种气味就像一具臭气熏天的尸体的气味，并且这类气味或臭味之间的区别就像他们生命的属灵品质之间的区别。这种臭味经常在我身边产生，尤其是一只臭老鼠的臭味；这种臭味对应于贪婪，也具有数不清的种类。我从这些事得出以下结论：该隐身上所立的记号就表示这种气味，并且这种气味如此强烈，以致他无处可去，因为人们都想把他赶走（创世记4:14,15）。类似的事发生在来世，我通过大量亲身经历被指示这一点。不过，当有人被带到自己的居所时，这种气味就从他身上被除去，因为如果那时有这种气味存在，他在任何地方都无法被接受，并留在那里。因此，他们被允许通过弥赛亚神单独安排的其它感知进入居所。（1747年12月9日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 323</h4><p>323. Spirits can smell odors, and those odors correspond to the spiritual life of [the deceased persons]<p>It is also amazing in regard to the dead after [earthly] life, that when it is so permitted, it can be clearly and perceptibly smelled what someone is like who has died; and when they had lived an evil life, then such an offensive odor is smelled from the corpse, that the spirits cannot stand approaching them. They have told me that it is an odor like that of a most stinking corpse, and that the differences between such odors or stenches are like those between spiritual qualities of their life. A stench of this kind has many times arisen near me, especially that of a decaying mouse, which corresponds with greed in its countlessly diverse forms.<p>These facts lead me to the conclusion that by the sign put upon Cain, an odor of this kind is meant, so intense that he could wander nowhere, without being driven away [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_4_14.htm">Gen. 4:14</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_4_15.htm">15</a>]. For a similar thing happens in the other life, as I have been shown by much actual experience.<p>But such an odor is removed from everyone when they are brought to their own habitations, for if it were then present, they could not be received anywhere and stay. So they are admitted into habitations by being perceived in a different way, through the disposition of God the Messiah Alone. 1747, the 9th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 323</h4><p>323. THAT SPIRITS CAN SMELL ODORS AND THAT THOSE ODORS CORRESPOND TO THEIR SPIRITUAL LIFE <p>It is a remarkable thing that the dead after their [bodily] life, when it is so permitted, can clearly and sensibly smell the quality of a subject who is dead; and in the case of those who have led an evil life the odor then given is as foul as that smelled from a corpse, so that they cannot suffer their approach. They have told me that such an odor is like that of a most fetid corpse, and that there is a diversity of such odors or stenches as there is of the spiritual things of life. A similar stench has often been excited near me, and indeed that of a stinking mouse, which corresponds to avarice, with indefinite variety. From these things I can conclude that by the mark set upon Cain is meant such an odor so that there was nowhere that he could wander, because men would want to drive him away: for something similar occurs in the other like which has been shown me to the life by much experience. But such an odor is usually taken away from anyone when he is carried to his own habitation, for if it were then present, he could not be received anywhere and stay there. Therefore they are admitted into habitations by other perceptions which are disposed by God Messiah alone. 1747, Dec. 9. </p>

Quod odorari queant spiritus, et quod odores isti correspondeant eorum vitae spirituali<p>Mirabile est, quod etiam mortui post vitam, etiam dum ita permittitur, possint clare et sensibiliter odorari quale id subjectum <sup>1</sup></p><p>est quod mortuum, et quum vitam egerunt malam, tunc odor tam teter e cadavere sentitur, ut non possint sufferre eorum accessionem; narrarunt mihi, quod talis odor sit qualis foetidissimi cadaveris, et quod odorum talium seu foetorum talium, differentia sit, qualis est spiritualium vitae; similis foetor multoties apud me excitatus fuit, et quidem muris foetidi, qui correspondet avaritiae, cum varietate indefinita; ex his concludere possum, quod per signum impositum Caino, talis odor intelligatur, sic ut nullibi potuisset vagari, quia vellent eum abigere [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_323/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_4_14" target=_top>Gen.
