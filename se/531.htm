<p>531.被问及他们是否知道他们的独一主是人。他说，他们知道这一点，并且是出于这一事实知道的：他们经常看到祂，所以知道祂是一个人，他们的独一主就是耶稣基督；尽管他们不是以这个名字来称呼祂。但被称为“耶稣基督”的，正是至高者自己，现在他们都一致承认：祂不仅是人，同时也是神。至于“国王”这个名，他们认为这有损祂的威严，因为国王这个名字带有世俗的意味。他们也承认“耶稣”的意思是“救主”，因为它与所有人的守护者是一个意思。（1748年1月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 531</h4><p>531. It was asked whether they know that their one only Lord is Human. He said that they know this, and indeed from the fact that they see Him often, so that they know that He is Human, and that their one only Lord is Jesus Christ, though not actually calling Him by this name. But that it is the Supreme One Himself, Who is to be called "Jesus Christ," this they all now confess with one accord. He is not only Human but also at the same time God.<p>As for the name "King," they think it is below His dignity, because the name of King savors of what is worldly. That "Jesus" means "Savior," they also acknowledge, because it is the same as the Keeper of all. <sup>1</sup><p>1748, the 24th day of January.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;At the end of this passage, B. Chastanier noted "see no. 3049." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 531</h4><p>531. It was asked whether they know that their One Only Lord is Man. He said that they do know it, and this from the fact that they often see Him, so that they know that He is a Man, and that their One Only Lord is Jesus Christ; not indeed that they so call Him by name, but that it is the Supreme Himself Who is called Jesus Christ. They all now unanimously confess not only that He is Man, but that He is also at the same time God. As regards the name "King", they consider that it is beneath His dignity, because it is a name that savors of something worldly; that Jesus signifies "Savior" they acknowledge, because this is the same as the Preserver of all. <sup>1</sup>1748, Jan. 24. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"See n, <a href="../se/3049.htm">3049</a>", has been added here in the MS. by another hand, apparently Chastanier's. </p>
