<p>530.他们还表明，他们不强迫自己的脸，而是任它自由展现；这种事对那些从年轻时候起就习惯伪装，也就是说，言行迥异于所思所爱的人来说是相当陌生的。后者的脸被收紧，好预备照着城府的劝诱或指示随时改变自己。然而，对木星居民或灵人来说，脸，尤其嘴唇周围的，是非常灵动的；因此，嘴唇有些突起，那里的纤维由此被赋予自由来表达他们所思想的一切。在地球上则截然不同，在那里，纤维被如此收紧，以致它们无法表达心智所感受到的东西。如果嘴唇和嘴唇周围的所有纤维都展开了，真理就会得到充分证实；那里有极其复杂的肌肉和纤维系列，以及成捆成束的肌肉和纤维；它们被造不可能只是为了咀嚼和说话，还为了表达心智最小的单一观念，这些观念由此可以说刻写在它们上面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 530</h4><p>530. They also showed that they do not force their face, but let it go freely, something quite unknown to those who have become accustomed from early youth to put on pretenses, or to speak and act differently than they think and love. Their face is drawn up tight, in readiness to vary itself as shrewdness dictates.<p>But with the [inhabitants of Jupiter] it moves freely, being especially let out around the lips, which protrude somewhat. In this way, the tissues are afforded the freedom of signaling everything they are thinking, quite differently from here [on earth], where the tissues are contracted, and thus unable to express the things felt by the mind. For if all the tissues in the lips and around the lips were taken apart, the truth would be quite evident: there are muscular and fibrous chains, and bundlings of the same, so complex that they could not possibly have been created only for chewing and speech, but also for expressing the least ideas of the mind, which can therefore be said to be written upon them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 530</h4><p>530. They also showed that they do not force their face but give it free play, which is quite unknown to those who from youth have been accustomed to simulate, that is to say, to speak and act otherwise than they think and love. The face of the latter is constrained so that it may be ready to vary itself, as craftiness persuades. With the spirits of Jupiter, however, the face is very mobile, especially around the lips, with the result that they are somewhat prominent, whence the fibers there are given the freedom to signify the things which they think. It is otherwise here on earth, where the fibers are so restricted that they cannot express the sensations of the "animus". For if all the fibers in the lips, and around the lips, were unfolded, the truth would be sufficiently confirmed; for there are extremely intricate muscular and fibrous series, and bundles of them, which were not created for mastication and speech alone, but for expressing the single ideas of the "animus", which thus may be said to be inscribed upon them. </p>
