<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1956</h4><p>1956. What a purified body is<p>Some maintain that people rise again after death even as to the body, and that the body would be purified. I was in a discussion today with certain spirits on this subject, and it was agreed that people do not know other than that they are clothed with a body when they enter into the other life. But it was also agreed that this body-like part yet remaining is also to die, and that then those earthly elements will be very submissive to the Lord. Then the body is said to be purified. 1748, 13 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1956</h4><p>1956. WITH IS MEANT BY THE BODY'S BEING PURIFIED. <p>There are some who hold that man rises after death even as to his body, and that the body undergoes a purification, and respecting which I was today in conversation with certain spirits; and it was acknowledged that man knows no otherwise than that he enters into the other life clothed with a body; but [they remarked] that this corporeal principle thus remaining would die, and thus the natural things [pertaining to him] become wholly obsequious to the Lord, for which reason it is said that the body would be purified. - 1748, May 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1956 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1956. Quid purificatum corpus<p>Quidam statuunt resurgere hominem post mortem, etiam quoad corpus, et quod corpus purificaretur, de quo hodie in sermone cum quibusdam spiritibus eram, et ita agnitum quod homo non aliter sciat, quam quod corpore indutus sit dum in alteram vitam intrat, sed [agnitum] quod corporeum hoc sic remanens etiam moriturum sit, et sic quod naturalia ista obsequiosissima futura Domino, sic purificatum dicitur corpus. 1748, 13 Maj. </p>
