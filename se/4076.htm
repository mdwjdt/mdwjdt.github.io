<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4076</h4><p>4076. On marriage<p>I realized that one who does not live in the love of faith cannot either live in the true love of marriage, and even if one seems to oneself to be in the love of marriage, it is nevertheless nothing but one kind or another of adultery or lust, or loving of the partner for the sake of cohabitation, of the pleasure of earthly life, of children for worldly purposes, and so forth. For heavenly qualities should stream into marital love, which are the heavenly qualities of faith. This can be confirmed by the case of the people before the flood. Because they lived in families, they were able to cohabit with their partner quite pleasantly, and yet they were of that character. In the other life, however, the pleasure of marriage, and cohabitation, enables them to be introduced into upright societies, which cannot take place without it. 1748, 26 Nov. From this it also follows that such as the faith is, such is the love of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4076</h4><p>4076. CONCERNING MARRIAGE.<p>It was perceived that he who does not live in the love of faith cannot live in the true love of marriage, and although he may seem to himself to live in the love of marriage, yet it is nothing else than a certain species of adultery or lewdness. He loves his wife solely for the sake of cohabitation and the delight of an earthly life, and his children for worldly ends, and so on; whereas celestial things, the celestial things of faith, ought to flow into conjugial love. This was confirmed from the antediluvians, who, because they lived in families could cohabit in abundant delight with a wife, but still they are of such [a celestial genius]. Nevertheless there is the delight of marriage and also cohabitation in the other life, so that there may be initiation into upright societies, which without that [love] cannot take place. - 1748 November 26. It hence also follows, that as the quality of the faith is, such is the quality of the love of marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4076 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4076. De conjugio<p>Perceptum, quod qui non vivit in amore fidei, quod nec possit vivere in vero amore conjugii, et tametsi in conjugii amore videtur sibi vivere, usque non est nisi genus quoddam adulterii aut lasciviae, amat conjugem solum ob cohabitationem, jucunditatem vitae terrestris, infantes ob fines in mundo, et sic porro; nam coelestia influere debent in amorem conjugialem, quae sunt coelestia fidei: confirmatum ab antediluvianis, qui quia in familiis vixerunt, potuerunt cum conjuge cohabitare satis jucunde, sed usque tales sunt; sed usque jucunditas conjugii et cohabitatio in altera vita facit, ut possit initiari societatibus probis, quod absque eo non fieri potest. 1748, 26 Nov. Inde sequitur quoque, quod qualis fides, talis amor conjugii. </p>
