<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2878</h4><p>2878. A conversation with certain Jews on the land of Canaan<p>I spoke with certain quite learned Jews about God the Messiah, saying that He was portrayed by the sacrifices, and that He is Jehovah the God of Israel, Who was to come; then about the land of Canaan, that He would introduce the faithful into the land of Canaan, by which not some country can be meant, but heaven - for what would they have by being introduced into some country where they would live only 40 or 50 years, and would die? So by the land of Canaan is meant heaven, where life is eternal. What are 40 and 50 years but a tiny dot, and hardly that compared to eternity, in which life they [now] are? Also (I now add), what need have their dead for such a land, who are myriads more than those who live?<p>On hearing all this they said, "Where do you get these things?"-seeming as if they were listening to them. I was given to reply that this is to be found in the prophets everywhere, and if they are understood, these things open up. As an example that the prophets are speaking about these things, I was prompted to say that Ezekiel (if I am not mistaken) describes the new Jerusalem and the New Temple [chap. 40-48]. These particulars can never be understood unless it is understood what heaven is like, which is symbolized by them. 1748, 21 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2878</h4><p>2878. A DISCOURSE WITH CERTAIN JEWS CONCERNING THE LAND OF CANAAN. <p>I spoke with certain quite learned Jews concerning God the Messiah, that he is represented by the sacrifices, and that he is Jehovah God of Israel who was to come: also concerning the land of Canaan, that he would introduce the faithful into the land of Canaan, by which cannot be understood any land but heaven, for what would it profit them to be introduced into some land, where they would live only forty to fifty years, and die. Wherefore by the land of Canaan is understood heaven, where is life eternal. What is forty and fifty years but a little point, and scarcely this, as respects eternity, in which life they [now] are. Then (I now add [this]) what need have their dead of such a land, of whom there are myriads in comparison with those who live. When they heard [this] they said, whence do you have these things: they seemed as if they paid attention thereto. It was granted to reply that this is everywhere in the prophets, who if they are understood, these things are patent: for example, that the prophets speak concerning such things, it was given to say that Ezekiel (if I mistake not) describes the new Jerusalem and new Temple. These things cannot be understood, unless it is understood of what nature is the heaven, which is signified by these things. - 1748, August 21. </p>
