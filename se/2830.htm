<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2830</h4><p>2830. The animate kingdom and the vegetable kingdom so interact hat when an earthly human thinks of one, spirits and angels can think and speak of the other at the same time<p>I spoke about some member of the vegetable kingdom to demonstrate a certain truth, namely that a truth should not be denied even though doubts arise that, if convincing, seem to break down the truth and cannot be cleared up. When I fixed my thought upon that member of the vegetable kingdom for the purpose of demonstrating that truth, and afterwards upon things animate, then I saw that the idea was not joined together continuously so to speak, as at other times. I was told that when my thought was fixed on the vegetative element, theirs was on the animate one, and when mine was on the animate element, theirs was on the vegetative one. For there is such a correspondence that the one can be thought of from the other, as though it were one thing. 1748, 15 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2830</h4><p>2830. THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS CORRESPOND IN SUCH A MANNER, THAT WHEN MAN THINKS CONCERNING THE ONE, SPIRITS AND ANGELS MAY, AT THE SAME TIME, THINK AND SPEAK CONCERNING THE OTHER. <p>I spoke concerning a certain vegetable in order to demonstrate a certain truth, to wit, that the truth is not therefore to be denied although doubts occur which cannot be solved [extricari]: which should they persuade would, as it were, destroy truths. When my idea was fixed on [in] [that] vegetable for the sake of demonstrating that truth, and afterwards on [in] animals [animatis], I then perceived that the idea was not so conjoined, and, as it were, continuous as at other times. I was told that when my idea was on [in] the vegetable, theirs was on [in] the animal, and when mine was on [in] the animal, theirs was on [in] the vegetable: for such is correspondence, so that from one thing it may be thought concerning another as if it were the one. - 1748, August 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2830 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2830. Regnum animale et regnum vegetabile ita correspondent, ut dum homo cogitat de uno, spiritus et angeli simul cogitare possint, et loqui de altero<p>Loquutus sum de vegetabili quodam, ad demonstrandum quandam veritatem, quod nempe ideo non neganda veritas, quamvis dubia quae si persuadent, sunt quasi destructiva veritatis, obveniunt, quae extricari nequeunt: cum in vegetabili figeretur idea mea, istius veritatis demonstrandae causa, et postea in animatis, tunc percepi quod idea non ita esset conjuncta et quasi continua, sicut alioquin; dicebatur mihi, quod cum mea idea esset in vegetabili, eorum esset in animali, et cum mea in animali, nam talis est correspondentia, ut ex uno de altero cogitari potest, sicut unum foret. 1748, 15 Aug. </p>
