<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2412</h4><p>2412. on his part, thought about God apart from the graven image, Who was creator of heaven and earth, and that He was the Lord, Who ruled the universal heaven and earth. I then felt the inward effect of his adoration, and it was much more holy than is ever the case with any Christian, and also deeper. This example shows that gentiles come into heaven much more easily than Christians, and that the same thing is happening as once did with the Jews, from whom the faith passed to the gentiles. 1748, 27 June.<p>Nor did this spirit need to be taught as others about the doctrinal matters of faith, but because he receives faith more easily than others, he is able to learn everything from the Lord, and this in such a way that he is able to instruct the most knowledgeable Christians in the doctrine of faith. This fact was also imparted to me by angels. 1748, 27 June. </p>
