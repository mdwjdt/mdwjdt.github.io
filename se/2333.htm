<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2333</h4><p>2333. for they have the clear sensation of touching a part of the body, prodding it, speaking into the ear, not at all supposing that they are not there. Yet, as said, they may be some thousands of miles away, for they have to be in some place.<p>They were told that it is an illusion of the senses when they think themselves so near, but they cannot be induced to believe it because they trust their senses. They were also told that there are no distances in the spiritual world, still less in the heavens, just as there are not to our sight even between ourselves and the sun, but we judge distances by intervening objects, as well as by previous knowledge. How [much more] would this not be the case in the spiritual world! </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2333</h4><p>2333. for they touch the part of the body evident to sense, act therein, speak in the ear, so that they never suppose other than that they are there, when yet, as has been said, they are absent thence several thousands of miles, for they must be in some place; it was said to them, that it is a fallacy of sense that they suppose themselves to be so near at hand, but this they cannot be induced to believe, because they trust to their senses; it was also said to them that distances are not given in the spiritual world, still less in the heavens. In like manner there are no distances to our sight, not even between us and the sun, but we estimate distances from [by] intermediates, as well as previous knowledge, which is not the case in the spiritual world.) </p>
