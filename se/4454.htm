<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4454</h4><p>4454. This reveals the character of the Nephilim of this age, and the lot that awaits them in the other life, and also that there is a flood in which they are perishing, like those before the flood, almost in the same way, in that today that other part [of the mind] that had been restored in them has been destroyed, and thus become persuasive, as that of the people before the flood was as to both parts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4454</h4><p>4454. Hence it is manifest of what quality the Nephilim of the present period are, and what kind of a lot awaits them in the other life, as also that it is a flood by which they perish, like the antediluvians, and almost in the same manner with them, inasmuch as that other part of the mind [namely, the intellectual] which was restored [after the flood], has been destroyed, and thus made persuasive, as the mind of the antediluvians was as to both parts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4454 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4454. Inde patet quales sunt Nephilim hujus temporis, et qualis sors eos manet, in altera vita, tum quod diluvium sit, quo pereunt, sicut antediluviani, fere simili modo, quod hodie pars illa altera quae restituta in iis perdita sit, ac ita persuasive facta, sicut antediluvianorum quoad utramque. </p>
