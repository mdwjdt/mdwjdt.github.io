<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第258节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>258.每当我念诵主祷文时，我就被提升到更内在的气场，虽然以各种不同的方式。每当我早晚念诵主祷文时，几乎每次我都以各种方式被提入更内在的气场；事实上，这种提升连同这种变化如此明显，以至于再没有比这更明显的了。这种情形已发生两年多了。在这些时候，对祷文更内在内容的各种解释就被激发。但当祷告结束时，我便被带回自己的正常环境。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 258</h4><p>258. I was raised up into the very inward realm, as often as I prayed our Lord's prayer, though in differing ways<p>Whenever I was praying our Lord's prayer, morning and evening, almost every time I was raised up, in different ways, into the very inward realm, and in fact [this raising up,] together with the change, was so perceptible that nothing could have been more so. This [has been occurring] now for more than two years.<p>Explanations of the more inward contents of the Prayer were inspired at these times, with a great deal of variety. But when the prayer was finished, I was let back into my normal environment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 258</h4><p>258. THAT I HAVE BEEN ELEVATED INTO THE MORE INTERIOR SPHERE BUT IN VARIOUS WAYS, AS OFTEN AS I SAID THE PRAYER OF OUR LORD <p>As often as I repeated the prayer of our Lord, morning and evening, almost as often was I taken up in various ways into the more interior sphere, and indeed with such a perceptible change that nothing could be more perceptible; and this now for more than two years. Explanations of the more interior things of the prayer were then insinuated with very great variety: but when the prayer was finished I was remitted into my ordinary sphere. </p>

Quod in sphaeram intimiorem sublatus sim, sed cum variatione, quoties orationem Domini nostri precarer<p>Quoties orationem Domini nostri orarem, mane ei vesperi, toties fere, cum varietate, sublatus sum in sphaeram intimiorem, et quidem ita perceptibiliter cum mutatione, ut nihil perceptibilius, et nunc ultra binos annos; explicationes tunc Orationis cum varietate permulta ejus intimiorum. tunc insinuatae sunt. Sed finita oratione remissus sum in sphaeram ordinariam. </p>
