<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2430</h4><p>2430. Such an operation of spirits into people on earth who trust in themselves and their own prudence does exist, as I have been given to find out by countless experiences, so it is a truth that should be believed. Nevertheless it is still nothing but a permission that evil spirits should thus persuade people, and when the person is such as to believe all their counsels firmly, they tend toward the person's own ruin and that of the community. For the things that come from evil spirits as if from ourselves all tend toward destruction. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2430</h4><p>2430. That there is such an operation of spirits in men who trust to themselves and their own prudence, it was given me to know from innumerable experiences, so that it is a truth, in which faith should be reposed, when yet it is nothing but a permission of evil spirits to persuade men thus, and when man is such, that all his counsels are so firmly believed in, they tend to his own ruin and that of the community [communis rei], for those things which [originating] from evil spirits [proceed] as from himself, tend to his ruin. </p>
