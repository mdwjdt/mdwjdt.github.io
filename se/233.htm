<p>233.关于代表。有些人习惯展示代表，尤其神圣事物的代表，并壮观地展示神圣事物。这类展示是不可以的，因为对它们的观念死后会保留下来，并被亵渎者转变为亵渎的代表。事实上，他们的性格状态决定了主题，即代表事务的每一个细节；因此，当性格败坏时，可知所包含的其它东西，或个体细节也会折向它，并由此具有阴郁和亵渎的表情。然而，性格正直的人却将这类代表转到不同方向，是纯真的；我曾在夜间清醒的状态下经历这一点。因为小孩子，连同纯真的灵魂，会柔和地表现弥赛亚下到坟墓里；但他们从来不显示为弥赛亚，而是显示为另一位，然而以一种叫人能远远地知道所代表的是弥赛亚的方式来显示；还表现出祂复活后下到坑里被囚的人中间，释放那里被掳的，把他们一起带入天堂；以及祂被联结于祂的神性本质。但如我所说的，这些事被表现得如此柔和，如此虔诚，以致他们若不仿佛从远处，一点也不可以想到弥赛亚神；在如此壮观的展示中，再没有比地球上的更骇人的了。（1747年11月1日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 233</h4><p>233. About displays<p>It is customary with some to present displays especially of holy things, and to make dramatizations of sacred subjects. Dramatizations of this type are not allowable, because the image of them remains after death and by the profane is turned into profane portrayals. For the level of their character determines the subject matter of the portrayals in the least details, so that when the character is corrupt, it follows that the rest of the contents, or the individual details, reflect that, and take on a melancholy and profane countenance.<p>However, displays of this kind are turned in a different direction by those who are of an upright character, and are innocent, which I experienced tonight while in a wakeful state. For little children, together with innocent souls, softly portrayed the Messiah let down into the tomb, but never did they show the Messiah, but another, in a way that one could know from a afar that the Messiah was being represented; then also how, after the resurrection, He descended to those bound in the pit, and loosed the captives there, and led them with Him to heaven; and that He was joined to His Divine Essence. But as I have said, these things were portrayed so softly, and so devoutly, that they were not in the least allowed to think of God the Messiah except thus as if from afar, so that it would be in no way frightening, as are the dramatizations on earth. <sup16_11747">11747</sup>, the 1st day of November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 233</h4><p>233. CONCERNING REPRESENTATIONS <p>It has been customary with some to exhibit representations, especially of holy things, and to institute certain spectacular displays of sacred things. Exhibitions of this sort are not allowable because the idea of them remains after death, and by those who are profane this is turned into profane representations: for the state of their dispositions governs the subject-matter of the representations in their single details: wherefore, when the disposition is perverted, it follows that the rest of the things contained, that is the single particulars, are bent with it; thus they induce a sad and profane countenance. But yet similar representations are turned differently by those who are of an upright disposition, and are innocent, as I experienced this night during wakefulness. For little children together with innocent ones, were softly representing the Messiah committed to the sepulchre; in no way, however, did they present the Messiah, but another, yet in such a manner that it might be known, as from afar, that the Messiah was signified. Then also it was represented, that after the resurrection He descended to the bound in the pit, and released the captives there and led them forth with Him into heaven: also that He was united to His Divine Essence. But, as I said, all this was represented so softly and so piously that not in the least were they permitted to think of God Messiah except as it were from afar, so that there was nothing terrifying as happens on earth at such spectacular exhibitions. <sup>1</sup>1747, Nov. 1, o.s. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Apparently a reference to the so-called Miracle, Mystery, or Passion Plays in common in the Middle Ages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 233 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>233. De repraesentationibus<p>Apud quosdam solitum est, sistere repraesentationes, cumprimis rerum sanctarum, ac instituere quasdam palaestras de rebus sacris, ejuscemodi palaestrae non licitae sunt, quia idea earum post mortem manet, et a prophanis vertitur in repraesentationes prophanas, nam status indolis eorum regit repraesentationum materiam in singulis, quare cum indoles perversa est, sequitur quod reliqua quae continentur, seu particularia singula eo flectantur, ita induunt vultum tristem et prophanum: at vero, similes repraesentationes aliter vertuntur ab iis qui probae indolis, ac innocentes sunt, quod hac nocte in vigilia expertus, infantes enim una cum innocentiis, molliter repraesentabant Messiam in sepulchrum missum, sed nequaquam, quod sisterent Messiam, sed alium, adeo ut e longinquo potuisset sciri, quod significaretur Messias, tum etiam quod post resurrectionem ad vinctos in fovea descenderet, et captivos ibi solveret, et secum in coelum adduceret; quodque Divinae Ipsius Essentiae copularetur; sed, ut <sup>1</sup></p><p>dixi, tam molliter, et tam pie, ut ne minimum admitterentur ad cogitandum in Deum Messiam, nisi ita quasi e longinquo, ut nulli terrori esset, sicut fit in terris per palaestras. 1747, die <sup>1</sup></p><p>Nov. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;inclarum in the Manuscript </p><p> </p>
