<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1645</h4><p>1645. The heavenly love soft words and letters, and indeed, prefer vowels, and they soften certain consonants<p>When I had a conversation with heavenly [angels], I could hardly find words agreeable to them. They would reject all those containing any kind of harshness, thus certain consonants that were too hard sounding for them. They love words that are flowing, such as fluvius, so they like vowels, because vowels are flowing. But consonants, if they are used, they actually soften so that they are not noticed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1645</h4><p>1645. THAT THE CELESTIALS LOVE WORDS AND LETTERS THAT ARE SOFT, THAT THEY PREFER VOWELS, AND SOFTEN CERTAIN CONSONANTS. <p>Whenever I discoursed with celestial spirits, I could scarcely find words that were agreeable to them. They were disposed to reject all such as had anything harsh or grating in the sound, consequently such as contained certain consonants that were harder than they loved to hear. They have a fondness for sounds that flow like a stream, and for this reason they affect the vowels, which are thus flowing; but if consonants are employed, they soften them, so that their harshness may not be perceived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1645 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1645. Quod coelestes voces et literas molles ament, et quidem eligant vocales, et quosdam consonantes molliant<p>Quando cum coelestibus erat sermo, vix potui invenire voces iis convenientes, rejicere volebant omnes eas, in quibus aliquis quasi stridor, sic in quibus certi consonantes, qui iis duriores erant, amant quae fluunt, sicut fluvius, ita vocales volunt, quia fluunt, at consonates, si adducuntur, etiam emolliint eos, ut quasi non sentiantur. </p>
