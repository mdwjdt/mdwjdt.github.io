<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5327</h4><p>5327. Those wealthy persons who were at the front had done nothing other than eat and drink and play, and so enjoyed a life of self-indulgence, certainly not thinking about any God. They worshiped but without any worship, out of habit. In a word, they did absolutely nothing else than live a life of self-indulgence. All their tableware was of gold and silver, and of precious stones as well. These were those who were thrown into the hells of the gentiles. They lived in luxury. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5327</h4><p>5327. Those of the rich who were at the front, had done nothing else than eat, drink, and amuse themselves, consequently, give themselves up to enjoyment, not even thinking about any God. They had a worship, but it was destitute of any [genuine] worship - a mere matter of habit. In a word, they had done nothing at all else than live for enjoyment. All their utensils were of gold and silver, and of precious stones besides. These are they who were cast into the hells of the Gentiles. They have lived in luxury. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5327 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5327. Divites illi qui antrorsus nihil aliud fecerant, quam comederunt et biberunt, et ludebant, proinde genio vixerunt, ne quidem cogitando de aliquo Deo, cultum habebant, sed absque ullo cultu, ex habitu, verbo prorsus nihil aliud egerant quam genio vivere; habebant utensilia omnia ex auro et argento, praeter ex lapidibus pretiosis, illi erant qui in inferna gentilium conjecti sunt. Vixerunt in lautitiis. </p>
