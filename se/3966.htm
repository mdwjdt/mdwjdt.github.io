<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3966</h4><p>3966. About very wicked ones<p>Certain spirits overhead spoke like those who cannot speak except like those who have lost the tone of their voice on account of rheumatism. Then they speak without resonance (heesa <sup>1</sup>). These spirits were extremely malignant, arousing things that had been delightful, and following closely in their own thought all and the very least details with a mind to finding out how they might ensnare, and destroy me. It was noticeable in every particular that they were paying attention to every detail, with the purpose of doing me harm, of destroying and finishing me. They were told that in this way they could not become anything than - not dung - but corpses.<p>Those are the kind who, in the world, draw forth the inward thoughts of others by slipping into them and causing them to tell about their pleasures, whereupon the person divulges more than usual, and all the while they are pondering how they might seize upon such things by which they may harm the person - one spirit in this way, another in that. And while they are thus drawing forth [the inward thoughts], they put on a flattering expression, as I have also noticed.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "hoarsely." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3966</h4><p>3966. CONCERNING [CERTAIN] ABOMINATIONS.<p>Certain spirits spoke above the head like those who can only speak in the manner of persons that have lost the power of articulate speech by rheumatism, and who then speak as it were without distinct sound [Heesa, hoarsely]. These were most malignant, exciting whatever was delightful, and closely following up in their thoughts all and singular things [of this nature], so that they might thence know how to plot most successfully to my destruction. It was observed that in every particular that their purpose was to note each single thing [pertaining to me], with the design of injuring, and totally destroying me. It was said to them that thus acting they could not become anything else than - not vile excretions - but dead corpses. They are such as in the world are accustomed to draw out the interior thoughts of others, and induce them by skilful insinuations, to speak of their delights, and thus to lure from them more than they would otherwise reveal. They then incessantly contrive how they may seize upon such disclosures and turn them to the injury of the party concerned, one in this thoughts, they still assume a flattering and wheedling air; which mode and another in that, and while thus inveigling one's was also perceived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3966 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3966. De nefandis<p>Quidam spiritus supra caput loquuti sunt sicut ii qui non possunt loqui nisi sicut ii qui rheumatismo amiserunt sonum loquelae, loquuntur tunc absque sono heesa, ii malignissimi erant, excitabant ea quae fuerunt jucunda, et sequuti presse omnia et singula cogitatione sua, animo ut inde caperent, quomodo insidiarentur, et me perderent, in singulis observatum, quod animus esset, ut attenderent ad singula, ex fine nocendi, destruendi, perdendi, iis dictum, quod non aliter fieri possint quam, non excrementa, sed cadavera; sunt tales, qui in mundo, protrahunt aliorum cogitationes interiores, per insinuationem ut narret de suis jucundis, tunc profert plura quam alioquin, et jugiter tunc cogitant, quomodo sic arripiant talia, quibus ei nocere possint, unus tali modo, alter alio, et cum sic protrahunt, tunc apparent animo adblandiente, quod quoque perceptum. </p>
