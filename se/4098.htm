<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4098</h4><p>4098. There was the other, who unobserved or secretly kept herself overhead, and in fact in the transverse suture at the left side of the head. The deceitful ones overhead had observed her and taken her as a medium, but she remained so dumb that they could not move her or speak through her at all. Then she sank down a little. When she was inspected, she was a medium more deceitful than those who wanted to take her, because she overturned the vessels, did not show herself there, but elsewhere, forward to the left, and in fact in the shape of a long, spiral coil; but when this was detected, she appeared in her own place, as a long, solid coil, by which it was revealed that she was from among the more deceitful. On examination she was discovered to have been the kind that did not want to stay with her husband, but under various pretexts would rush out and commit adultery with [other] men. Thus at first moved by the restraint of shame, she had made up excuses, but when unmasked before the husband, such then rush openly into brothels. So they learn their tricks. Such spirits dwell in the sutures, trying by that route to get into the brain - and they are a species of sirens. 1748, 29 Nov.<p>When the deceitful ones overhead persisted, she could change them into monsters, and into monkeys, and the like, about which they complained, so they were not allowed to have such a one as their medium. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4098</h4><p>4098. There was another who secretly or stealthily held herself above the head, and indeed within the transverse suture at the left side of the head. The deceitful above the head observed her and took her for a subject, but she remained dumb, so that they could neither move her nor speak through her. She then sunk somewhat downwards. When inspected she proved to be a subject more deceitful than her principals, as she perverted the [recipient] vessels. She did not exhibit herself where she really was, but elsewhere, to the left in front, and that too in the form of a long spiral coil; but being detected in this, she appeared in her own place, as a similar coil, but apparently solid; by which she was manifested as being among the more deceitful. Upon examination she was discovered to have been of the character of those who are averse to dwelling solely with their husbands, but under various pretexts were addicted to gadding abroad, and having adulterous intercourse with other men. In this career they are at first under some degree of restraint from the bonds of modesty, and therefore frame pretexts for their conduct, but when at length unmasked to their husbands they rush openly into stews; hence they acquire their deceit. Such dwell in the sutures [of the cranium] and would fain enter into the brain through that way. They are a species of sirens. - 1748, November 29. While the deceitful remain above the head, such a one as I have described is able to change them into monsters, as monkeys, and the like, of which they complained; wherefore it was not allowed them to have such a one for a subject. </p>

Erat alia, quae clam aut occulto se tenuit supra caput, et quidem inter suturam transversalem ad sinistrum caput, eam observarunt dolosi supra caput, et pro subjecto sumserunt, sed obmutuit, adeo ut nequicquam eam movere seu loqui per eam possent, tum subsidit paulum; erat subjectum dolosius quam ii, cum inspiceretur, quia vasa pervertebat, se non ibi manifestabat sed alibi antrorsum ad sinistrum, et quidem in formam longam helicis, sed hoc detecto, in loco suo, ut helix solida longa, qua manifestatum quod inter dolosiores esset; et examinata fuerat talis, quod apud maritum non morari voluerit, sed sub vario praetextu proripuerit se foras; et adulterata cum viris, ita primum pudoris vinculo acta, quod praetextus effinxerit, at cum manifestata marito, tunc aperte ruunt [tales] in lupanaria, inde dolos suos discunt, tales habitant in suturis, qui volunt per eam viam in cerebrum, suntque species sirenum. 1748, 29 Nov. Cum perstarent dolosi supra caput, potuit eos in monstra vertere, tum in simias et talia, de quo conquesti sunt, quare non licebat iis talem pro subjecto habere. </p>
