<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3711</h4><p>3711. At this day nothing but love of self and the worldly reigns<p>I was told that almost all coming out of the world think about nothing else but becoming the greatest and possessing all things, almost no one caring about the common good, and scarcely [knowing what it is], even though pretending to care, while actually pursuing their own loves. I asked about those who were only merchants, as in Holland, who despise dignities, and it was said that they too were of that character, because they want to be esteemed above all others on account of their riches and wealth. The greedy are different, being the most vile, nor do they care about honors nor pleasures. All things gratifying the love of self and the world they evaluate only looking to wealth. So they are worse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3711</h4><p>3711. THAT AT THIS DAY NOTHING REIGNS BUT THE LOVE OF SELF AND OF THE WORLD.<p>It was told me that nearly all who come from the world think of nothing else than of becoming great, and of possessing all things, scarcely anyone caring for the common good, or knowing [that there is any such thing], although under the pretence of the common good they consult their own peculiar loves. Inquiry was made concerning those who were only traders, as in Holland, who contemn dignities, and it was said that they also were such as would fain be esteemed above all others, and especially on account of their superior opulence. The avaricious are otherwise, as they are the most sordid [of all], caring neither for honors nor pleasures. Everything pertaining to the love of self and the world they present to themselves with an exclusive regard to wealth, and thus show themselves to be worse than others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3711 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3711. Quod hodie nihil nisi sui et mundi amor regnet<p>Dictum mihi, quod omnes fere qui e mundo veniunt, nihil aliud cogitent, quam ut maximi fiant, et ut omnia possideant, et nullus fere commune bonum curant, et vix sciunt, tametsi sub communi bono, suis amoribus studuerint: quaesitum de iis qui solum mercatores sunt, ut in Hollandia, qui contemnunt dignitates, dictum quod ii quoque tales sunt, quia prae aliis se aestimari volunt ex divitiis et opulentia: aliter sunt avari, qui sordidissimi, nec curant honores, nec voluptates, sibi omnia quae sunt amoris sui et mundi, proponunt in solum intuitione opum, ita pejores. </p>
