<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>374.关于地狱和地狱团伙的残忍。地狱团伙的残忍是永远无法描述的；他们在幻觉中以对别人最敌对的方式行事；他们对别人所实施的残忍行为若真的被描述出来，所有人必不寒而栗。因为如果他们真的照其幻觉实施残忍，他们的残杀甚至比最凶猛野兽的还要残忍。在他们的幻觉中，他们似乎拿出刽子手的斧头和其它处死的工具；若非弥赛亚神制伏他们的野蛮，他们企图所折磨的人也会有最残忍的感觉，或说实际感受到最严厉的折磨。因为在灵魂当中的幻觉能力是这样：它们能带来肉体般的感觉，因而带来折磨的剧痛感。弥赛亚神消除这些感觉；事实上，祂夺走地狱团伙的致命工具。简言之，这些残忍行为比任何人所能想象的还要恐怖。若不是弥赛亚神拯救并赎回比最残忍的野兽还要坏的人类，若不是祂不断把人类从地狱的惩罚和痛苦中释放出来，人类早就做出如此残忍的行为了。（1747年12月21日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 374</h4><p>374. About hell, and the cruelty of the hellish gang<p>What the cruelty of the hellish gang is like, can never be described. In their fantasies they carry on in the most hostile manner toward others, committing such cruelties against them that if they should be described, [all] would shudder. For if they were able to carry out the cruelties as in their fantasies, their butcheries would be more cruel than those of even the fiercest wild animals.<p>In their fantasies they seem to pull out executioner's axes, and other instruments of death; and if God the Messiah did not subdue their savagery, those they intend to torment would actually feel most severely tortured. For the power of fantasies among souls is such that it can bring on a physical-like sensation and, accordingly, one of excruciating pain. These sensations God the Messiah erases, and indeed, He takes the deadly instruments away from them.<p>In short, there are more horrible things than anyone could ever believe. The human race, which is worse than the fiercest wild animals, would have practiced such cruelties, had not God the Messiah saved them, and redeemed them, and did He not continually free them from the pains of hell. 1747, the 21st day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 374</h4><p>374. CONCERNING HELL AND THE CRUELTY OF THE INFERNAL CREW <p>What the cruelty of the infernal crew is like can never be described; they act from phantasies in the most hostile manner against others upon whom they exercise such cruelties that if they were to be described they would horrify. For if they could exercise cruelties according to their phantasies, their butcheries would be even more cruel than those of the most ferocious wild beasts. By their phantasies they as it were bring forth axes and instruments of death, and unless God Messiah subdued their savagery, those whom they intend to torment would also have the most cruel sensation. For such is the power of phantasies amongst souls that they can induce a sensation as though it were corporeal, thus likewise torments. God Messiah removes those sensations; indeed He takes away the instruments of death from the infernal crew. In a word, these cruelties are more horrifying than one can ever believe. The human race, which is worse than the most ferocious wild beasts, would have exercised such cruelties unless God Messiah had saved them and redeemed them, and thus He continually liberates them from infernal punishments. 1747, Dec. 21. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 374 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>374. De inferno et infernalis turbae crudelitate<p>Qualis crudelitas infernalis turbae est, nusquam describi potest, agunt ex phantasiis inimicissime, contra alios, in quos tales crudelitates exercent, ut si describerentur, horrescerent; si enim secundum phantasias exercere crudelitates potuissent, lanienae forent crudeliores <sup>1</sup></p><p>quam usque ferarum ferocissimarum, secures et instrumenta mortis per phantasias quasi promunt, et nisi Deus Messias domaret saevitias eorum, etiam ii quos cruciare intendunt, sensum crudelissimum haberent, nam talis est phantasiarum vis inter animas, ut inducere possint sensum ut corporeum, similiter ita cruciatus, eas sensationes tollit Deus Messias, imo instrumenta mortis ab iis aufert; verbo horrenda magis sunt quam usquam aliquis possit credere genus humanum, quod pejus est feris ferocissimis, tales crudelitates exercuissent, nisi Deus Messias eos salvaverit et eos redemerit, et sic ab infernalibus poenis continue liberet. 1747, die 21 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has crudiliores </p>
