<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5471</h4><p>5471. About the four corners, and about those who were there, and about their last judgment, then about dragons, and about the abyss into which they were thrown<p>Everything in the other life must be looked at in relation to such an alignment. There is a middle, where those are who are truly Christians, and in its center the New Jerusalem, a quadrangle. The corners must be looked at in relation to the extensions into the quadrangle, for example, the corner between west and south is ghik; the corner between east and south is ab, etc.; the corner between east and north, op; the corner between west and north is mn. These lines are called an extension of the corner. </p>

It is quadrangular. The angles must be regarded in relation to the extensions into the quadrangle as, for example, the angle between the west and south is ghik; the angle between the east and south is ab, etc.; the angle between the east and north, op; the angle between the west and north is mn these lines are called the extensions of the angle. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For no. 5470, which is Fig. 10, see page 420. -Ed. <p>2.&nbsp;Figure 10 is a drawing of a square, each side of which is labeled with a direction - with east being on the top.

Juxta talem situm consideranda sunt omnia in altera vita, est meditullium, ubi vere Christiani, et in cujus medio Nova Hierosolyma, quadrangularis, anguli considerandi sunt secundum extensiones in quadrangulum, ut angulus inter occidentem et meridiem ghik, angulus inter orientem et meridiem ab etc., angulus inter orientem et septentrionem, op: angulus inter occidentem et septentrionem mn.
