<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3128</h4><p>3128. About speech with spirits<p>Speech with spirits appears to them exactly like the speech of people on earth among themselves, and one might be surprised that they do not perceive it but as entirely the same. Yet the difference is such as that between speech of the mouth and speech of the thought, so that the thought is speaking, not the tongue or mouth, and that spirits see at once if the person wants to hide something, and if something else lies hidden [than] what is pretended. If there is something like that, or if the person wants to hide something, then they rather at once draw forth his thoughts into the light, and if he pretends something, then he is at once blamed of falsehood.<p>Moreover, speech with spirits is richer, so that everything contained in verbal ideas is more fully visible, besides more things that have been said about spirits and mental images earlier. This [was written] in the presence of those who could not see otherwise but that the speech of spirits and people on earth are the same. And in fact, if [a spirit] were to speak in this way to man such as he is, then within several minutes the person's brain would be pulled apart and he would become insane. 1748, 12 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3128</h4><p>3128. CONCERNING SPEECH WITH SPIRITS. <p>Speech with spirits appears to them wholly like the speech of men with each other; and anyone may wonder that they do not perceive other than that it is entirely the same. But still there is such a difference as between the speech of the mouth and the speech of thought; so that thought, and not the tongue or mouth speaks, and that spirits at once perceive if [one] wishes to conceal anything, and if anything else is latent, whatever is simulated, if there is such, so that if [one] wishes to conceal anything, then, at once, do they the rather draw out his thoughts into the light, and if he simulates aught, he is immediately charged with falsity. Moreover, speech with spirits is fuller, so that whatever may be in the ideas of words is more fully disclosed, besides many things which [I have said] previously concerning spirits and ideas. This [is written] in presence of those who could not perceive other than that the speech of spirits and men is the same; yea, if man should thus speak with man, in which a state as he is, his brain [cerebrum] would in a few minutes be distracted and become insane. - 1748, [September] 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3128 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3128. De loquela cum spiritibus<p>Loquela cum spiritibus apparet iis prorsus sicut loquela hominum inter se, et mirari quis potest, quod non aliter percipiant quam quod prorsus eadem, sed usque est talis differentia sicut loquela oris ad loquelam cogitationis, sic ut cogitatio loquatur, non lingua aut os, et quod spiritus illico percipiant, si quid abscondere velit, et si quid aliud latet, quod simulatum est, si quid tale, ut si quid abscondere vult, tunc illico magis cogitata ejus protrahunt in lucem, et si quid simulat, illico inculpatur falsitatis; praeter quod loquela cum spiritibus sit plenior, sic ut quicquid sit in ideis vocum plenius pateant, praeter plura quae de spiritibus et ideis prius. Hoc in praesentia eorum, qui non potuerunt aliter percipere quam quod loquela spirituum et hominum sint eadem; et quidem si ita loqueretur homo cum homine tali ac est, intra aliqua minuta distraheretur cerebrum et insaniret. 1748, 12 [Sept.] <sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
