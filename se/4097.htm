<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4097</h4><p>4097. About mediums<p>The deceitful spirits overhead knew how to take to themselves mediums from among those female spirits overhead whom others had not noticed to be present and who thought they were lying hidden there in secret, about which matter I spoke with them. But before they become mediums, the other spirits do not know whether they will serve their purposes. Today they took two, and as soon as they started to work on one of them, she twisted herself around, and so to speak closed herself in, so as to express refusal from the outset. After that she wrapped herself by a kind of rolling movement, lest they should make use of her. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4097</h4><p>4097. CONCERNING SUBJECTS.<p>The deceitful above the head know how to assume to themselves [female] subjects from among those who are also above the head, but whom others had not observed as being [present], and who believed themselves to be secretly concealed there, concerning which I spoke with them. But before these become subjects, the spirits mentioned do not know whether they can be made available to their purposes or not. Today they assumed a couple, and one of them, as soon as they began to act upon her, immediately retorted, and, as it were, closed herself in, so as to indicate a total refusal. Afterwards she enwrapped herself in a certain kind of swathing, in order to avoid serving them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4097 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4097. De subjectis<p>Dolosi supra caput sciebant sumere sibi subjecta ex iis quae supra caput, quas alii non observarunt adesse, et quae crediderunt in occulto ibi latere, de quo cum iis loquutus; sed antequam subjecta fiunt, non sciunt [an] sibi applicabilia sunt, bina hodie sumserunt, unam illico ut agebant, tunc se retorsit et quasi claudebat se, sic ut prorsus renueret illico, postea se involvit quasi volutione quadam, ne de ea servirent. </p>
