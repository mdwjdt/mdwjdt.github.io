<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4980</h4><p>4980. While this was going on, however, communication between me and them was closed, so I did not know what they were creating. But once this doctrine had been hatched up and worked out, communication was opened and [the doctrine] was read. It was to this effect: 1) They should worship and adore the pope as the Vicar of Christ; 2) He had the keys of Peter, so he could open and close heaven to whomever he willed, and also hell; 3) They should worship Mary as the goddess of heaven; 4) as well as the saints below her, the saints who came before her and those who became saints after her; 5) The pope had supreme power over emperors and kings; 6) Emperors and kings had no part in the matters of the Church; 7) Those who do not acknowledge these things were condemned and had no blessing on Earth or in the heavens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4980</h4><p>4980. Meanwhile, the communication between me and them was closed, so that I did not know what they did; but, afterwards, that doctrine was sent out and carried into effect, so that communication was opened, and it [i. e. the doctrine] was read. It was to this purport: 1st, that they should worship and adore the Pope, as the vicar of Christ; 2nd, that he had the Keys of Peter, so that he was able to open and close heaven and also hell to whomsoever he would; 3rd, that they should worship Mary as the goddess of heaven; 4th, that they [should worship] also saints, beneath her - saints who were formerly holy men, and afterwards were made saints; 5th, that supreme power over emperors and kings belongs to the Pope; 6th, that emperors and kings have no business with the affairs of the Church; 7th, that they who would not acknowledge these things were condemned and had no blessing, either on earth or in the heavens. </p>

Interea claudebatur communicatio inter me et illos, ut non scirem quid facerent, sed postquam doctrina illa exclusa et facta fuit, ut aperiebatur communicatio, et legebatur: quae talis erat<p>1) quod Pontificem colerent et adorarent ut vicarium Christi;<p>2) quod illi claves Petri essent, ut aperire et claudere posset coelum cuicunque vellet, et quoque infernum;<p>3) quod colerent Mariam sicut deam coeli;<p>4) quod etiam sanctos infra illam, sanctos qui prius sancti fuerunt, et qui postea fierent sancti;<p>5) quod papae summa potestas supra caesares et reges;<p>6) quod caesares et reges nullam rem haberent cum rebus Ecclesiae;<p>7) quod qui non agnoscerent illa, condemnarentur, nec aliquam benedictionem haberent in terra nec in coelis. </p>
