<p>560.那些与我同在的人看见了马，于是说，他们那里有许多这样的马，但这些马都在森林里。即便马并不伤人，他们仍极其害怕马，事实上，对它们有某种根深蒂固的惧怕。这种惧怕的原因在于，马代表知识，它是人的知识，或通过感官所获得的知识，因而属于肉体、自我和世界；这种知识迷惑了上古教会，导致堕落；这与迷惑他们的知识树（创世记3:6）是一样的。他们惧怕马的原因就隐藏在这些事里面，由此可推知，他们不可以学习科学知识，因为这样他们的理解力就变得昏暗、模糊和盲目了，从而对自我和世界的爱开始占据主导地位，而这些爱来源于黑暗并在黑暗中掌权。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 560</h4><p>560. Those who were with me saw horses, then said that many such are to be found with them, but they are in the forests, and they fear them greatly. Even though they do no harm, there is nevertheless a certain ingrained fear of them. The cause of this lies in the fact that horses portray knowledge, and that it was personal knowledge, or knowledge [obtained by] the senses, consequently pertaining to the body, self, and the world, that had led the most ancient Church astray and caused the fall - the same thing as is meant by the tree of knowledge, which led them astray [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_6.htm">Gen. 3:6</a>]. Herein lies the cause of the fear of horses, and from this it follows that they should not learn sciences, for thus their understanding is darkened and blinded, and thus the loves of self and of the world begin to dominate, which originate from and reign in darkness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 560</h4><p>560. When those who were with me saw horses they said that many such were to be found with them, but they are in the forests; and although they do no harm they were very much afraid of them, indeed, a certain fear of them is implanted. The latent cause of this fear is that horses represent the sciences, and that the sciences of particulars, or of the senses, and consequently of the body, of self, and of the world, were what had seduced the Most Ancient Church, and hence caused the fall. The tree of knowledge which seduced them has a like signification. In these things lies hidden the reason for their fear of horses. Hence it comes about that they ought not to learn the sciences, for thus their understanding is obscured and blinded, and so the loves of self and the world, which thence derive their origin, begin to have dominion, reigning in darkness. </p>
