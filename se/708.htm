<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 708</h4><p>708. Moreover, I could not but marvel considerably at how gentle and calm the spirits of the inhabitants of Jupiter are. This I was allowed to learn due to the fact that for several days now, if not for a week, they have been with me, and obtained a place in my head [<a href="542.htm">542</a>, <a href="553.htm">553</a>]. They are very gentle, and do nothing but think, and their thoughts are so yielding, that they allow themselves to be bent, simply at the good pleasure of the inward heaven or of their angels, and thus at the will of the one only Lord. They are patient, so that hardly the least bit of indignation is observed. When they notice that this or that is not granted them, they acquiesce at once, nor do the doubts of other [spirits] cling to them, but seem to leave them untouched. They are so [calm] that unless I had known of their presence from other indications, I could scarcely have known it from some change in their state of mind. Content in those things which are enjoined on them: these are their words. 1748, 10 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 708</h4><p>708. Moreover, I could not but greatly marvel at the mildness and gentleness of the spirits of the inhabitants of Jupiter, which I was granted to know by their having been with me now for some days, if not a week, and having acquired a place in my head. They are so mild that they [do] nothing but think. Their thoughts are so flexible that they suffer themselves to be bent away from the mere good-pleasure of the interior heaven, or of their angels, thus [to be led] by the will of the One Only Lord. They are so patient that scarcely any slight indignation is noticed when they observed that this or that was not granted them; they at once acquiesce. Neither do the doubts of others adhere to them, but they pass them over as though they are of no account. They are such that it was only from other indications that I knew that they were present; I could scarcely know it from any kind of alteration of their "animus". They are content with those things that are enjoined upon then. These are their words. 1748, Feb. 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 708 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>708. Praeterea non potui non satis mirari, quam mites mansueti sunt spiritus incolarum jovis, quod nosse mihi datum est per id quod per aliquot jam dies, si non septimanam penes me fuerint, et locum adepti in capite tam mites sunt, ut nihil nisi cogitent, cogitationes eorum tam flexiles sunt, ut se patiantur flecti, ex modo beneplacito coeli interioris seu eorum angelorum, sic a voluntate unici Domini; sunt patientes, ut vix indignatio quaedam pusilla animadvertatur: cum animadvertunt hoc vel illud iis non concedi, illico quiescunt, nec dubia aliorum haerent in sed ea quasi transmittunt nihil. Sic sunt, ut nisi ab indiciis aliis nossem quod adessent, vix ab aliqua alteratione quadam animi eorum id scire possem; contenti in iis, quae iis imperantur, haec <sup>1</sup></p><p>sunt eorum verba. 1748, 10 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript erronee sublineatum </p>
