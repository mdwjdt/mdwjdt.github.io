<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5910</h4><p>5910. Martin Luther too was questioned, about whether he had thought according to his professed doctrine, which is that [the Lord's body and blood] is in, with, and under [the bread and wine]. He said he had thought of the holiness and not according to doctrine. He said further that he had wanted to think according to the doctrine and that as often as he did he was so agitated that his mind was tormented and that from then on he never thought in that way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5910</h4><p>5910. Luther, also, was questioned, whether at such times he thought according to his doctrine, which is, that [the Lord's body and blood are] in, with and under [the bread and wine]. He said that he thought of the holiness, and not according to the doctrine. He stated, moreover, that he wished to think according to the doctrine, and that, as often as he was so impelled, he was tortured in mind, and, therefore, he never afterwards thought in that way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5910 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5910. Etiam Lutherus interrogatus est, num ille secundum doctrinam suam, quae est quod sit in, cum, sub, dixit quod sanctum cogitaverit, et non secundum doctrinam, dixit porro, quod voluerit cogitare secundum doctrinam, et quod toties ita emotus sit, ut quoad animum cruciaretur, ac ideo dein nusquam ita cogitaverit. </p>
