<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第526节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>526.关于龙。龙从天上摔到低地（还没有到最低的地方，只是叫他注意到惩罚，使他能够悔改），在不断尝试行恶，没有任何效果后，他最终显出自己是神造物主最苦毒的敌人，以前他曾说自己敬拜祂。不过，我也被允许知道这是一种什么样的敬拜，即：若不是在祂之上，好指责祂，因为一切事并未如他所愿，他就把自己置于与祂对等的位置上。事实上，他发怒，诅咒神；因此，他被推下最低的区域，在那里受到一些折磨。不久之后，他整夜发疯一样地诅咒我，没有任何理由；没有人刺激他，唯独他自己刺激自己这样做。就因为我反对他，他就亵渎神，把诅咒指向我。这一切我整夜都能感受得到，因此那时他被留下独自一人。当我醒来，有人告诉他这一切后，他像往常一样承认了。于是他试图离得远远的，直到宇宙的尽头，好逃避惩罚。但我尚不知道他是否出于敌意这样做。这样的命运就等待着那些不承认耶稣基督为中保的人，这就是他们对至高无上的造物主的态度、“敌意”；他们嘴上承认祂，心里却认为自己与祂平等；当其邪恶的意图和努力得逞时，他们就在心里把自己提到祂以上，因为他们不承认中保。（1748年1月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 526</h4><p>526. About the dragon<p>When the dragon had been cast down from heaven to the lower parts - not yet to the lowest, except only to call his attention to the punishment, so that he might repent - finally, after having attempted evil things one after another, and without any result, he then showed himself as a most bitter enemy of God the Creator, Whom he formerly used to say he worshipped. But what kind of worship this had been, I was also allowed to learn, namely, that he placed himself on a par with Him, if not above Him, and even reproached Him because not everything came out as he wished. In fact he became angry, and cursed [God]. For this he was thrust down toward the lowest parts, where he was tormented for yet a little while.<p>Thereafter, throughout the whole night, as if insane, prodded by no one but himself alone, he cursed me, without giving a reason, he blasphemed, aiming his curses at me because I had opposed him. I could feel this all through the night, so he had been left on his own at that time.<p>After he was told about this, when I was awake, he admitted to it, as usual. And then, so as to avoid the punishment, he tried to get far away, to the ends of the universe. But whether he is sincere, I do not yet know.<p>Such a fate awaits those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as the mediator, and such is their attitude toward the most high Creator, Whom they confess with the mouth, while in their heart, they consider themselves His equal; and when their evil intents and attempts are successful, then at heart they raise themselves above Him, for they acknowledge no mediator. 1748, the 24th day of January. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is a line separating this paragraph from the next one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 526</h4><p>526. CONCERNING THE DRAGON <p>When the dragon was thrust down out of heaven to the lower regions - not as yet to the lowest, except only for the sake of observing the punishments that he might repent - after he had continually striven to do evils without any effect, he at length showed himself as a most hostile enemy to God the Creator, Whom he before said he adored. But it was also granted me to know what his adoration was like, namely, that he placed himself equal to, if not above Him, so that he might upbraid Him because all things did not succeed with him; indeed, he was angry, and cursed, for which reason he was thrust down towards the lowest region, where he is still being somewhat tormented. Soon afterwards he became as though insane, being excited by himself alone during the whole night, without any given cause. From the fact that I opposed him, he blasphemed, and directed his blasphemies against me which I could feel through the whole night, so that he was then left to himself. After this was told him when I was awake, as usual he acknowledged it, and so he wanted to remove himself afar - to the ends of the universe - that he might escape punishment. But whether he did this from his "animus" I do not yet know. Such a lot awaits those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ, the Mediator, and whose "animus" is such towards the Supreme Creator, Whom they confess with the mouth, but in their heart make themselves equal to Him; and when their evils and their evil efforts succeed, then at heart they raise themselves above Him, for they acknowledge no Mediator. 1748, Jan. 24. </p>

De dracone<p>Quum deturbatus esset draco de coelo, ad inferiora, nondum ad infima, nisi modo supplicii advertentis causa, ut resipiscat, tandem postquam continue mala molitus esset, et hoc absque ullo effectu, tunc infensissimum hostem se praebuit Deo Creatori, Quem prius se narrabat adorare, sed qualis adoratio, etiam mihi nosse datum est, nempe quod se parem, si non supra Ipsum, poneret, sic ut Ipsum increparet, quod non omnia ei succederent; imo iratus est, et maledixit, quare versus infima est detrusus, ubi aliquantisper <sup>1</sup></p><p>adhuc cruciatus est; postmodum tanquam insanus, per totam noctem a semet solum excitatus, absque ulla data causa, ex eo quod adversatus ei sim, blasphemavit, et blasphemias ad me dirigebat, quod sentire potui, per totam noctem, sic ut tunc sibi relictus sit; postquam hoc ei dictum, in vigilia, agnovit, sicut solet, et sic se elongare voluit, sic ut evitaret supplicium, ad fines universi; sed num ex animo, nondum scio. Talis sors manet eos, qui non agnoscunt Jesum Christum mediatorem, et talis animus eorum est ad Creatorem supremum, Quem oretenus fatentur, sed corde suo Ipsi parem [se] <sup>2</sup></p><p>faciunt, et quando iis succedunt mala, ac tentamina, tunc corde se supra Ipsum evehunt, nam nullum mediatorem agnoscunt. 1748, d. 24 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript aliquid imperfecte in aliquantisper emendatum; J.F.I.<p>2.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
