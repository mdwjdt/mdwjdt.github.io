<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2270</h4><p>2270. They observed particularly that there is an inspiration of everything written in the Word of the Lord. For it now appeared to them how, and how much, streamed into the words being written by me, in fact not only into the general sense, but even into the individual words and images of the words. Indeed, it looked to them as if there were someone holding my hand and writing while supposing they themselves were doing the writing. I also was inspired to realize this by means of a spiritual mental image, in fact actually to feel it, and once before, that it went into the very least detail of each tiny letter that was being written. From this it as clear as day, that the Word of the Lord is inspired down to every single letter. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2270</h4><p>2270. They especially observed what is the inspiration of those things that are written in the Word of the Lord, for now it appeared to them how [it took place], and what faculty flowed into those things which were written by me, yea, not only into the sense, but even into the single words and ideas of words, yea, it seemed to them as if certain held my hand, and wrote, deeming that they were those who wrote. This was also granted me to perceive by a spiritual idea, yea, as it were, to feel beforehand what was in the most single [singularissima] [idea] of every little letter which was written: hence it is, as in clear light, that the Word of the Lord is inspired as to every letter. - 1748, June 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2270 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2270. Imprimis observabant, quod inspiratio sit eorum quae scripta in Verbo Domini, nam nunc iis apparuit, quomodo et quae copia influeret in ea quae scriberentur a me, imo non solum in sensum, sed etiam in singulas voces, et vocum ideas, imo visi iis, quasi quidam tenerent manum meam, et scriberent, autumantes, quod ii essent qui scriberent, quod mihi quoque per ideam spiritualem, percipere dabatur, imo quasi sentire, prius quod [influeret] in singularissima cujusvis literulae, quae scriberetur; inde sicut in clara luce est, quod inspiratum Verbum Domini, qqoad unamquamvis literam. 1748, 10 Junius. </p>
