<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5837</h4><p>5837. ABOUT RESURRECTION<p>I have spoken with some acquaintances three days after their death, with Silverstrom, with Polhem, <sup>1</sup>with Brita Behm, <sup>2</sup>with the minister of justice, and with others known to me by reputation, several weeks after their death. They were present and saw their own funeral rites, and they saw everything.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See footnoted information on him in passage <a href="4722.htm">4722</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Swedenborg's maternal aunt. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5837</h4><p>5837. THE RESURRECTION. <p>I have spoken with acquaintances after death; with some, after three days from death. I have spoken thus with Silfverstrom, <sup>1</sup>with Polhem, with Brita Behm, <sup>2</sup>with the consul of justice; <sup>3</sup>and with others known to me by repute, after several weeks. They attended and witnessed their own funerals, and saw all things there. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Georg Johannes Silfverstrom, according to Dr. Kahl, a distant connection of Swedenborg's by marriage, he having married a daughter of one of Swedenborg's cousins on the mother's side. Silfverstrom was born in 1701 and died 1752. (See Kahl's Narratiunculae, pp. 32 and 4.) -TR. <p>2.&nbsp;The Latin has Britz. But as the Behm family-tree does not contain that Christian name, while it does contain the similar one of Brita, we conclude that the latter is the name intended, and have, therefore, placed it in the text. Dr. Kahl in his Narratiunculae comes to the same conclusion (p. 8), whilst Dr. R. L. Tafel, in his Documents, assumes this to be the case, without remark (Vol. I. p. 859). Brita Behm was Swedenborg's aunt on the mother's side. She died, according to Dr. Tafel, in 1755 but Dr. Kahl has it, 1757. -TR. <p>3.&nbsp;Respecting this official, Dr. Kahl says it was, "without doubt, Peter Aulaevill" who is mentioned at nos. 5800 5948. (See Narratiunculae, art. "Behm Brita," p. 8). -TR. </p>

DE RESURRECTIONE<p>Loquutus cum notis post mortem aliquibus post triduum a morte, ita loquutus sum cum Silwerstr�m, ita cum Polhem, ita cum Brita Behm, ita cum justitiae consule, cum aliis etiam notis per famam post aliquot septimanas, fuerunt praesentes et exequias suas viderunt, et viderunt illi omnia. </p>
