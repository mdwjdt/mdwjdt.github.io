<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5670</h4><p>5670. About enlightenment through the Word and human understanding in respect to the Word<p>A person's intellect is what is enlightened when a person reads the Word. This is evident from the fact that those who do not have a developed intellect know nothing other than the literal meaning when they read the Word, nor can they be led to the truth itself there. From this is clear that boys cannot be enlightened, that those who are completely simpleminded cannot, and that those whose notion of things is dim cannot. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5670</h4><p>5670. ILLUSTRATION BY MEANS OF THE WORD, AND MAN'S INTELLECTUAL IN RELATION TO THE WORD. <p>It is man's Intellectual that is illustrated when he reads the Word; as is plain from the fact that one who has not the Intellectual <sup>1</sup>is aware of nothing beyond the sense of the letter when he reads the Word; nor can he be led to the truths themselves which are there. Hence it is that boys cannot, that the wholly simple cannot, and that those who are in obscurity about things cannot. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In order to understand the meaning, here, it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that the "intellectual," or rational, faculty, as distinguished from that of knowing is not developed in man, and he does not possess it, until he reaches adult age. AC 6125 is very emphatic and clear on this point. -TR. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5670 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5670. De illustratione per Verbum et intellectuali hominis quoad Verbum<p>Intellectuale hominis est quod illustratur cum legitur Verbum, quod patet ex eo, quod qui intellectuale non habet, nihil sciat quam sensum literae cum legit Verbum, nec potest duci ad ipsa vera ibi, inde est quod pueri non possint, quod prorsus simplices non possint, quod qui in obscuro sunt de rebus non possint. </p>
