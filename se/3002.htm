<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3002</h4><p>3002. About the power of looking in the other life, thus the power of looking through faith, and about conviction regarding matters of faith<p>This night on awakening in the morning I was shown what power there is in a look in the other life, and at the same time, in conviction. There was a certain one who thought that by a look directed to others, he could lead them and bring them wherever he wanted. Because it is so commonplace in the other life that [spirits] are able to allure others to themselves and join their thoughts to their own, thus even to call many together, among countless other effects of looking, it is therefore a very common magic in the other life. Such is the look of the dragon when he wants to call evil doers together, such is that of those who arouse others to be present. And spirits imagine they can do anything just by such looks, about which very much could be told. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3002</h4><p>3002. CONCERNING THE FORCE OF INTUITION IN THE OTHER LIFE; THUS, CONCERNING THE FORCE OF INTUITION THROUGH FAITH, AND THE PERSUASION OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE OF FAITH. <p>(It was shown me this night, in wakefulness, and at [in the] morning, what force, intuition, along with persuasion, has in the other life. There was a certain one who supposed that by intuition directed upon others he could lead them and bear them away wherever he wished, which [thing] is so common in the other life, that by means of intuitions they can allure others, which intuition effects. Such is the dragon's when he wishes to call together evil doers; such is theirs who excite others to be present. Hence, therefore, it is a very common magic in the other life; and spirits suppose that they alone can do all things by means of such intuition. Many things could be said about this. </p>

De vi intuitionis in altera vita, ita de vi intuitionis per fidem, et persuasione eorum quae sunt fidei<p>Hac nocte in vigilia, et mane ostensum est, quam vim in altera vita habet intuitio, et simul persuasio: erat quidam, qui putabat quod per intuitionem directam in alios, posset eos ducere et auferre quocunque vellet, quod quia in altera vita ita commune est, ut per intuitiones possint alios ad se allicere, et eorum cogitationes suis adjungere, ita etiam convocare plures, praeter innumera, quae efficit intuitio--talis <sup>1</sup></p><p>est draconis cum convocare vult maleficos, talis est eorum, qui excitant alios, ut praesentes sint--ideo <sup>2</sup></p><p>est magia inde communissima in altera vita; et putant spiritus quod possint omnia facere solum per tales intuitiones, de quibus plura dici possent.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has intuito, talis<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has sint, quare (sic!) </p>
