<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5346</h4><p>5346. In the west were those who had the greatest degree of the love of self, whose goal was control; in the east were those whose love was commanding [others]; in the north were those who were overall in the dim light; in the south were those who had been intelligent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5346</h4><p>5346. Those in the west are those who have been in an extreme love of self and had rule as their end; in the east are such as were in the delight of the love of ruling; in the north, those who are in an obscure light respecting everything; and in the south, such as have excelled in genius. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5346 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5346. In occidente fuerunt qui in maximo amore sui, quibus imperium pro fine, in oriente qui in jucundo amoris imperandi, in septentrione qui in obscuro lumine de omni; in meridie qui ingenio polluerunt. </p>
