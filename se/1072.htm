<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1072</h4><p>1072. When this spirit was rejected several times by societies of the inward heaven, he seemed to speak and act with authority, as if he were above the spirits; but because these were tricks, and at the same time arrogance, he was punished, and in fact, severely, the punishment lasting a half hour, more or less. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1072</h4><p>1072. After having been rejected several times from the societies of the interior heaven he seemed to speak and act from authority, as if he was above other spirits; but because his speech and actions were deceitful, and at the same time he was arrogant, he was punished, and indeed severely. The punishment lasted for half-an-hour, more or less. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1072 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1072. Is cum aliquoties a societatibus coeli interioris rejectus est, quasi supra spiritus, ex auctoritate loqui et agere videbatur; sed quia doli erant, et simul fastus, punitus est, et quidem severe, punitio perstitit per semihorium, minus vel plus. </p>
