<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>476.三个领袖从天堂被推下来。今天夜里，三个领袖，就是我旁边的A.、J.和M.再次被推下来。其中两个还丧失了理解力，以致他们很愚蠢；如魔鬼被剥夺理解力，只剩下本能时通常的样子。A.是个例外，他仍使用自己的理解力。其他人取代了他们，好接待到来的人。但这些替代者抱怨说，他们无法为这些人提供帮助。替代者描述了他们成群结队地来寻问A.、J.和M.在哪里；他们看上去极其丑陋，丑陋地无法形容；他们完全丧失了理解力，因为他们看不清任何真理和良善。因此，他们更值得哀哭。他们在自己以之为耶路撒冷圣城的街道上跑来跑去，好像疯了一样；他们乞讨，但没有人接待他们，如他们所说，也不愿给他们东西吃。他们的城很悲惨，街道也很窄。（1748年1月15日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 476</h4><p>476. The three leaders were thrust down out of heaven<p>Again last night, <sup>1</sup>the three leaders, A., J. and M., who were near me, were thrust down. Two of them were also deprived of their power of understanding, so that they were silly - as is normally the case with devils when the faculty of understanding is taken from them and they are left with only instinct. A. was the exception, who still had use of his understanding.<p>Others were substituted in their place to receive those who came, but these substitutes complained that they could do nothing for them. They describe how they come in bands and ask where A. J. M. are, and how extremely ugly they look, ugly beyond description. They are completely devoid of understanding, unable to discern anything of what is true and good. Therefore they are rather to be wept over. As if insane, they scurry about through the streets of what they think to be the city Jerusalem, and beg. But no one receives them and, as they say, is willing to feed them. Their city is miserable, the streets narrow. 1748, the 15th day of January.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 281, 461-464, 466, 469. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 476</h4><p>476. THAT THE THREE PRIMATES WERE THRUST DOWN FROM HEAVEN <p>This night those three primates, namely A(braham), J(acob) and M(oses), who were near me, were again thrust down, and two of them were deprived of their faculty of understanding, so that they were foolish, as is usually the case with devils from whom the faculty of perceiving is taken away, and with whom only instinct remains - except A[braham] who excels in understanding. Others were substituted in their place that they might receive those who came. But these complained that they were unable to help. They related, that they come in troops, and seek where A. J. M. are; that they appear very greatly deformed - the deformity cannot be described; that they are entirely destitute of understanding, for they can see clearly nothing of truth and good; they are therefore the more to be lamented. They run about through what they suppose to be the streets of the city of Jerusalem, as if they were insane; and they beg, but no one receives them, nor, as they say, is willing to give them nourishment. Their city is miserable, the streets are narrow. 1748, Jan. 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 476 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>476. Quod e coelo detrusi <sup>1</sup></p><p>sint tres primates<p>Iterum <sup>1</sup></p><p>hac nocte detrusi sunt tres primates, nempe A.J. et M. <sup>2</sup></p><p>qui prope me erant, et duo eorum orbati facultate intelligendi, sic ut essent fatui, ut solent diaboli, quibus adempta est facultas percipiendi, et quibus solus est instinctus remanens, praeter A. qui suo intellectu polluit, alii loco eorum substituti sunt, ut reciperent venientes, sed ii conquesti sunt, quod nihil proficere quirent, describunt, quod turmatim veniant, et quaerant, ubi A. J. M. et quod deformes maxime appareant, deformitas describi nequit, destituti sunt intellectu prorsus, nam nihil veri et boni perspicere possunt, ideo lamentandi potius, discurrunt sicut insani, ut putant per plateas urbis Hierosolymae, et mendicant, sed nullus eos accipit, et ut ajunt, nutritionem dare vult. Urbs eorum est miserabilis, plateae angustae. 1748, die 15 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has detruisi ut apparet<p>1.&nbsp;de casibus prioribus videantur 28 461-64, 466, 469<p>2.&nbsp;hoc est Abrahamus, Jacobus et Moses </p>
