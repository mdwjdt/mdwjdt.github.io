<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5966</h4><p>5966. About those who were in the former heaven<p>Ones like those who were in the former heaven still try to rise up to places where similar [spirits] had been. However, since these places have been given to angels, they are unable to work their way up so far now, but in their ascent they are moved off and carried along other paths, and thus little by little, lower and lower, in the end to their own places where they will be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5966</h4><p>5966. THOSE WHO WERE IN THE FORMER HEAVEN. <p>Such as were in the former heaven, still endeavor to flee away to the places where those like themselves were; but inasmuch as those places have been given to angels, therefore they are now unable to force themselves so far, but are removed in the ascent and carried away by different routes, and thus, by degrees, lower and lower, and at length to their own places where they are to be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5966 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5966. De illis qui in priori coelo<p>Tales qui fuerunt in priori coelo, adhuc conantur assurgere ad loca, ubi similes fuerunt, sed quia loca illa data sunt angelis, ideo non eo usque nunc eniti possunt, sed in ascensu removentur et feruntur per alias vias, et sic paullatim humilius et humilius, tandem ad sua loca, ubi erunt. </p>
