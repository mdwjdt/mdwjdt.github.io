<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4944</h4><p>4944. About heaven and the last judgment<p>Again it was seen that great cities had been destroyed. One had sunk; another was transferred to another place that was sinking. The former was sinking quite deeply, not slowly but quickly. It was sinking in the middle, and the slanting sides followed. So it went, into the deep, and when in the deep, the sides higher up were forced in, and thus it was closed above. But before this, those who were better, having been called out, got away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4944</h4><p>4944. CONCERNING HEAVEN AND THE LAST JUDGMENT.<p>It was again seen that great cities were destroyed: one sank down; another was transferred. The one which sank down, sank to a very great depth, not slowly but quickly; it sank in the middle, and the inclined sides followed, and thus [it went down] into the depths. And while they were in the depth, the sides were pressed together above, and thus it was closed up at the top. But the better sort, who were previously called forth, got away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4944 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4944. De coelo et ultimo judicio<p>Iterum visum est quod magnae urbes destructae fuerint, una subsiderit, altera translata fuerit, quae subsidebat, illa subsidebat admodum profunde, non lente sed cito, in medio subsidebat, et latera inclinata sequebantur, sic in profundum, et dum erant in profundo, coarctabantur latera superius, et sic occludebatur supra; sed prius evocati exierunt meliores. </p>
