<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2515</h4><p>2515. For everyone is esteemed according to their inward qualities, as people on earth also esteem their leaders according to their inward qualities, but for the sake of subordination, honor is paid to them, which honor dies among the people together with the dying leader. Only esteem for his inward qualities remains with many who are intelligent and wise.<p>I was prompted to add in front of them that this kingdom is such that no one is esteemed in the kingdom of the Lord by virtue of dignity and learning in the life of the body. It is different than in the kingdoms of the world, where this is done for the sake of subordination and government in societies. 1748, 4 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2515</h4><p>2515. Because everyone is esteemed according to his interiors, like as also man [estimates] princes by [in] their interiors; but, for subordination's sake, honor is paid them, which honor amongst men dies with him when he dies, only the estimation of his interiors remains among many who are intelligent and wise. It was given to add, in their presence, that this kingdom is of such a quality that no one is esteemed in the Lord's kingdom from dignity and learning in the life of the body , otherwise than is the case in the kingdoms of the world. This happens for the sake of subordination and government in the societies. - 1748, July 4 [July for June, I think]. </p>
