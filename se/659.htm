<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 659</h4><p>659. Moreover, no sooner did I look at something in the stores, or at money and such, than the craving of these and similar spirits became evident within me. For, thinking that they were myself, it was as if they instantly wanted me to reach out my hand, quite contrary to my usual behavior, and in addition, slipped their own passion into my mind.<p>About that passion I have subsequently at times spoken with the spirits, saying that I had realized such spirits were present. This they could not deny, but were obliged to affirm it, explaining their character, and what comes over them. 1748, 6 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 659</h4><p>659. Moreover, as soon as I looked at anything in shops, or at money and the like, the cupidity of these same and similar spirits was made known with me; for supposing themselves to be me, they at once desired, as it were, that I should stretch forth my hand, contrary to all custom. Furthermore, they insinuated into my "animus" their own cupidity. Concerning this I have sometimes spoken with these spirits, saying that I was aware that such spirits were present, and they could not but assent or confirm it, relating their genius and what happens to them. 1748, Feb. 6. </p>

Praeterea iidem ac similes, ut primum conspexi aliquid in officinis, seu pecunias, ac similia, eorum cupido penes me innotuit, nam putantes <sup>1</sup></p><p>se esse memet, illico quasi cupiebant, ut manum exporrigerem, contra omnem consuetudinem, et praeterea animo insinuarunt suam cupiditatem, de qua cum spiritibus tunc <sup>2</sup></p><p>quandoque loquutus sum, nempe quod agnoverim tales spiritus adesse, qui non potuerunt non annuere, seu confirmare, narrando eorum genium et quid iis obvenit. 1748, 6 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
