<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3323</h4><p>3323. by experiencing inner breathing, and from the fact that all speech and being touched by speech is governed by the breathing, so there is nothing in the mental image of a word or of speech that is not determined by the breathing. So it follows that the mental imagery of the most ancient Church was far richer than can ever be the case at this time. Thus the outer aspect of the imagery is such breathing, because the imagery produces it. Such also is the breathing of spirits, and consequently such is their mental imagery with its countless differences, as well as levels of inward breathing. Thence it follows that the imagery of the heavenly angels also is nothing but respirations, and the Lord Alone is their life. So I have now been instructed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3323</h4><p>3323. as well from a certain perception confirmed by experience of internal respiration, as that all speech and affection [affectus] of speech is directed through respiration, so that there is nothing in the idea of the word [voice] or speech which is not determined by the respiration. Wherefore it follows that ideas of the most Ancient Church were much fuller than can ever be given in these times: thus the external of the idea belongs to such respiration because the idea brings it forth [producit]. Such also is the respiration of spirits, hence consequently their ideas, according to indefinite differences, also according to degrees, as respects interior respirations. Hence it follows that the ideas of angels, even of the celestials, are nothing but respirations, and their life the Lord alone. Thus have I now been instructed.) </p>
