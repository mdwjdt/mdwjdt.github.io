<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4039</h4><p>4039. On the other hand, those who had acquired a conscience in the life of the body, or those who had received goodness and truth, receive in the other life much more, indeed, infinitely more, for all their faculties are immeasurable increased - just as also with the evil, the qualities of evil there are so increased that those who in the life of the body had been a little deceitful, in the next are very deceitful, thus become magicians in the other life. Hence they rush into hell, and into punishments and purgings, 1748, 22 Nov. But there is knowledge that they there acquire, and there is a greater ability, that goes with their life after death, to get ahold of that knowledge and practice it - but not beyond the evil they had acquired in act. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4039</h4><p>4039. On the other hand, those who have acquired a conscience in the life of the body, that is, those who have received goodness and truth, these in the other life receive far more, yea, infinitely more, for all their faculties are immensely augmented. In like manner the evil qualities of the wicked are there so much increased, that those who, in the life of the body, were but little deceitful, are very deceitful in the other life, so as there to become magicians. Hence they rush into hell, and into punishments and vastations. - 1748, November 22. There are also scientifics which they acquire to themselves there, and the faculty of their life in regard to acquiring and exercising them is there greater, but still it does not go beyond the actuality acquired [in the life of the body]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4039 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4039. Alioquin qui conscientiam nacti in vita corporis, ut et qui bonum et verum, ii in altera vita multo plus, imo infinite plus accipiunt, nam omnes facultates immensum augentur; sicut etiam apud malos qualitates mali ibi ita augentur, ut qui in vita corporis fuerunt dolosi parum, in altera sunt dolosi multum, ita qui magici fiunt in altera vita; inde ruunt ad infernum, et in punitiones et vastationes, 1748, 22 Nov.; sed sunt scientifica quae sibi ibi comparant, et est facultas vitae eorum post mortem arripiendi et exercendi ea major, sed usque non ultra actualitatem acquisitam. </p>
