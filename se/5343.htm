<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5343</h4><p>5343. The rest, who too had been diligent by being of use to others there in various ways, in preparing food, in making clothing, in the other work there, and who had done this out of affection and religious motivation, were brought outside the region of the Church so that they might there form a community in a place safe from annoyance by men, [and] so that they might learn the truths of faith, because this kind learns, not however those who have been idle. This community was formed in the border region between the south and the west, far off in the region, where they are safe, and teachers are sent to those there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5343</h4><p>5343. The rest - also women - who were diligent in serving others there, in various modes, in reference to food, clothing, and the rest of the employments there, and who did so out of affection and religion - these were brought away outside of the region of the Church, so that they should form a society there, in a place protected from infestations from men, in order that they might there learn the truths of faith; for such ones learn - not, however, those who have been idle. That society was formed in the confine between the south and west at a remote distance, in a region where they are safe; and, to them, in that place, are sent those who teach. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5343 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5343. Reliquae quae diligentes quoque fuerunt, inserviendo aliis ibi variis modis, pro cibo, pro vestibus, pro reliquis functionibus ibi, et quae hoc fecerunt ex affectione et religione, illae deductae sunt extra Ecclesiae tractum, ut ibi societatem formarent, in locum tutum ab infestationibus a viris, ut ibi discerent vera fidei; nam tales discunt, non vero quae otiosae fuerunt. Societas illa formata est in confinio inter meridiem et occidentem remote in terra, ubi tutae, et ad quas ibi mittuntur [qui] docent. </p>
