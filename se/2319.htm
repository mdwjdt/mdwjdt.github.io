<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2319</h4><p>2319. A multitude of people together in this world in one place, can nevertheless be so separated in the world of spirits that they are very far apart<p>The fact that they are in one place in the world, or as to bodily life, does not mean that they are together in the other life. One may be to the east, another to the west, and one be controlled by spirits who are toward one quarter, and the other by those in a different quarter. For it is one's quality that determines whether one is here or there, as we may deduce from the location of spirits in the grand body and from distances in the other life, which exist entirely according to a person's quality. So a little child may be lying at its mother's bosom, and while the infant is in heaven, the mother may be in hell, and so on. 1748, 13 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2319</h4><p>2319. THAT A MULTITUDE OF MEN WHO CAN BE TOGETHER IN THE EARTH, OR BE IN THE SAME PLACE, CAN YET BE SO SEPARATED IN THE WORLD OF SPIRITS AS TO BE QUITE FAR APART. <p>(The being in one place in the world, or after the life of the body, does not cause the being together in the other life. One may be in the east, another in the west, and be ruled by spirits; one by spirits who are towards [verses] one quarter [plaga], and the other by those who are in another quarter; for the quality of man causes him to be here or there [ita vel ibi], as may be sufficiently concluded from the places of spirits in the Grand Man [magno corpore], and from distance in the other life, which is not otherwise constituted than according to the quality of the man; wherefore an infant can lie in its mother's bosom: the infant may be in heaven whilst the mother may be in hell, and so forth. - 1748, June 13.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2319 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2319. Quod hominum multitudo, quae simul in terra, seu in uno loco, usque tamen in mundo spirituum ita separati esse possint, ut distent valde <sup>1</sup></p><p>Quod in uno loco sint, in mundo, vel post {a} vitam corporis, hoc non facit ad id, quod simul sint in altera vita, possunt unus esse ad orientem, alter ad occidentem, et regi per spiritus unus per spiritus qui versus unam plagam sunt, et alter ab iis ad alteram plagam, nam qualitas hominis facit, quod ita vel ibi sit, sicut satis concludi potest, a spirituum locis in magno corpore, aque distantia in altera vita, quae non aliter se habet, ac secundum qualitatem hominis; quare infans in sinu matris jacere potest, infans est in coelo, mater potest esse in inferno, et sic porro. 1748, 13 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has valed </p>
