<p>428.天上的享受和快乐有很多种，都有幸福在其中。它们被称为天上的享乐，这些享乐能到达灵魂的感觉，好像灵魂活在肉身中那样。有些享受如此快乐地感染他们，以致他们几乎承受不住。但也有些快乐来自还要内在的源头。享受中有各种不同的幸福；快乐中则有天上的婚姻喜乐。总之，就不同的类型和强度而言，享受和快乐有很多层级。这些享乐可在那些正在分享它们的人中间毫不减少地共享。真正的享受和真正的快乐都有幸福在自己里面，而幸福有平安，平安则有纯真。因此，真正的享受和快乐唯独来自弥赛亚神，如同来自它们独一的源头。（1747年12月30日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 428</h4><p>428. There are very many varieties of heavenly pleasures and delights, in which is happiness<p>Those pleasures are called heavenly that come to the sensation of souls as though they were living in the body. There are pleasures which affect them so delightfully, that they can hardly bear any more. But there are delights that come from a still deeper source. In the pleasures there are different kinds of happiness, and in the delights, different kinds of heavenly marital joy. In short, there are very many levels of pleasures and delights, both as to different types and as to intensity; and these pleasures can be shared without lessening them in those who are sharing them. True pleasures and true delights have within them happiness, and happiness has peace, and peace innocence; so that true pleasures and delights come solely from God the Messiah as their only source. 1747, the 30th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 428</h4><p>428. THERE ARE VERY MANY VARIETIES OF HEAVENLY ENJOYMENTS AND DELIGHTS IN WHICH IS HAPPINESS <p>They are called heavenly enjoyments which exist sensitively with souls, as if they were living in the body. There are enjoyments which affect them so pleasantly that they can scarcely bear more. But there are delights that come from a still more interior source. In enjoyments there are types of happiness; in delights there are types of heavenly conjugial joy. In a word, there are very many degrees of enjoyments and of delights, both as to differences and intensity. These enjoyments are communicable without diminution with those who communicate them. True enjoyments and true delights have happiness in themselves, and in this there is peace, and in this innocence. Thus true enjoyments and delights come solely from God Messiah, as from their one only source. 1747, Dec. 30. </p>
