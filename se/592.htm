<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>592.关于对女人，尤其过着奢侈、懒散生活的女人的一种惩罚。我见过对那些过着奢侈、懒散生活的女人的一种惩罚；这是某些地区的女人的特点，当她们变得富有，出于某种原因被提升到高于其他女人的显赫地位，从而安顿下来享乐，像女王一样，让自己被家仆和侍从伺候时，除了沉溺于高雅、懒散，斜躺在沙发上，打扮自己，坐在宴会和餐桌上，以这种方式过生活之外，她们什么都不关心。但我看到了这些女人后来在来世所经受的残酷惩罚。有两次，我被告知，她们不是那种像女王一样出生在这种环境下的女人，或不是那些从小就在这种环境下长大，因而已经习惯了的女人，因为这些女人不知道别的。此处所说的这种女人是指那些随着时间推移，由于某个显赫的地位或财富，以及由此而来的傲慢，从而放任自己生活奢华的女人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 592</h4><p>592. About a punishment of women, especially, who lead an indulgent and idle life<p>[I have seen] the punishment of women who lead an indulgent and idle life, characteristic of those in some regions when they have become wealthy, and for one reason or another rise to prominence above others - who thus reside in pleasures, letting themselves be waited on like queens by servants and attendants, not having to worry about anything, just indulging their inclinations in elegance and indolence, reclining on couches, dressing up, and sitting at tables and desks; and in this fashion they pass their lives.<p>But having seen the fierce punishment that such women undergo in the other life, I was told two times that they were not the type of women who had been born into such conditions, such as queens, or who were brought up in them from early childhood and thus accustomed to them, for these have known nothing else. The type of women that are meant here are those who, because of some distinction, or because of riches, and the resulting arrogance, in the course of time have thus given themselves up to voluptuous living. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 592</h4><p>592. CONCERNING THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WOMEN ESPECIALLY, WHO LEAD A LUXURIOUS AND INDOLENT LIFE <p>There is a punishment for those women who have led a luxurious and indolent life, as is characteristic of women in some regions when they have become wealthy and for some reason raised to eminence above other women, and so settle down to delights, and like queens let themselves be waited upon by domestics and attendants, having no care for anything else than in indulging their inclination in elegance and indolence, in reclining on couches, in attiring themselves, and in sitting at feasts and [card] tables [et sedendo ad mensas et tabulas], and in living their life in this way. But I saw the cruel punishment which such women afterwards undergo in the other life. Twice I was instructed that such are not those women who have been born to these things, like queens, or those who have been brought up in such things from infancy, for these women know nothing else, because they are accustomed to them. But those women are meant who in course of time from a certain eminence, from riches, and hence from pride, have thus given themselves up to pleasures. </p>

De Poena faeminarum imprimis, quae delicatam vitam ac otiosam agunt<p>Poena [mihi visa est] earum quae delicatam et otiosam vitam agunt, quae propria est faeminarum, in quibusdam regionibus, dum divites factae, et supra alias emineant, ex quacunque causa, et sic sedeant in delitiis, sibique serviri patiantur a famulis et ministris, sicut reginae, nec ullius rei curam habeant <sup>1</sup></p><p>, solum indulgendo genio, in lautitia et otio, accumbendo stratis, semet vestiendo, et sedendo <sup>2</sup></p><p>ad mensaset tabulas, et sic vitam suam peragant, sed postquam vidi poenam crudelem quam tales sustinent in altera vita,instructus sum, bis, quod tales faeminae non sint, quae ad similia natae sunt, sicut reginae, aut quae ab infantia in similia educatae sunt, nam eae nihil aliud sciunt, quia iis adsuefactae; sed quod intelligantur tales, quae <sup>3</sup></p><p>temporis successu ex eminentia quadam, ex divitiis, ex fastu inde, ita se voluptatibus dedunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
