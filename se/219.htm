<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>219.我被恩赐与被囚的正直灵魂分享天上的喜乐。因为许多年来，我一直被恩赐以各种不同的方式清楚感受天上的喜乐；这些喜乐如此众多，又具有多样性，以致我丝毫不能描述它们。事实上，它们具有这样的性质，如果我非要把它们描述出来，世人根本就不相信，也不明白。总之，今天蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，天上的喜乐被赐予我，无以言表；我还被恩准将它们传给被囚的灵魂，仿佛它们出于我，而事实上并非出于我。他们说，他们能感受到这些喜乐，也从它们得到安慰。此外，他们被称为“飞鸟（另一版本为绵羊）”，这对他们来说也是一个极大的安慰。我无法描述他们以哪种方式从囚禁中上升到某种自由，不仅上升到言谈的自由，还上升到理解、感知、谈论和看见的自由；我也无法描述他们的快乐，尽管我被允许清楚察觉它。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 219</h4><p>219. I seemed to be given the ability to communicate heavenly pleasure to upright souls in captivity<p>Since many years ago it has been granted to me to clearly sensate heavenly pleasures in different ways, and so many of them and in such a variety of ways, that I cannot in the least describe those pleasures. They were of a kind that a person on earth could never believe or understand, if I should attempt to describe them.<p>In any case, today, by the mercy of God the Messiah, heavenly pleasures were given to me, not expressible, which I was then allowed to transfer - as if they were from me, when yet they were not from me - to souls in captivity, who said they were able to feel those pleasures, and from them they also received consolation.<p>Moreover, they are called birds <sup>1</sup>- which is a great comfort to them - because of the way they rise up from captivity into a kind of freedom, both of speaking and of understanding, of perceiving, speaking and seeing; nor can I describe their pleasure, even though I am being allowed to perceive it tangibly. 1747, the 24th day of October (old calendar).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;J.F.I. Tafel read "sheep" (oves) for "birds" (aves). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 219</h4><p>219. IT WAS GRANTED ME TO SHARE, AS IT WERE, HEAVENLY DELIGHT WITH UPRIGHT SOULS IN CAPTIVITY <p>For many years past it has been given me manifestly to feel heavenly delights in various ways, so many and of such kinds that I can in no wise describe them; for they have been such that if I should endeavor to describe them man could not at all believe and understand them. Meanwhile, today, by the mercy of God Messiah, inexpressible heavenly delights have been given me, and it was also granted me to transfer them to the souls in captivity, as if from myself, when yet it was not from me. They said they could themselves feel these delights, and they also received consolation from them. Moreover, they are called "sheep", which also is very comforting to them. In what way they ascend from captivity into a kind of liberty, not only of speaking but also of understanding, perceiving, speaking and seeing, cannot be described, although it is rendered perceptible to me by manifest sense. 1747, Oct. 24, o.s. </p>

Quod jucunditatem coelestem quasi datum sit mihi communicare cum animabus probis in captivitate<p>A pluribus annis retro sentire mihi manifeste datum est jucunditates coelestes variis modis, et tot ac talibus, ut eas describere nequicquam possim; quae tales fuerunt, ut homo nequicquam eas <sup>1</sup></p><p>credere ac intelligere posset, si describere eas conarer; interim hodie ex misericordia Dei Messiae mihi datae sunt jucunditates <sup>2</sup></p><p>coelestes, non expressibiles, quas etiam concedebatur mihi, tanquam ex me, cum tamen ex me non erat, transferre ad animas in captivitate, quae jucunditates eas dicebant se sentire posse, et inde quoque consolationem accipiebant; vocantur etiam aves <sup>3</sup></p><p>, quod iis quoque multo solatio est, quomodo ascendant a captivitate in speciem libertatis, tam loquendi, quam intelligendi, percipiendi, loquendi, videndique, nec describi potest, tametsi ad manifestum sensum id mihi datur perceptibile esse. 1747, die 24 Oct. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ea<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has jucundites<p>3.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
