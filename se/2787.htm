<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2787</h4><p>2787. Convictions in the other life can be rooted out only with great difficulty, and this the more deeply and widely the conviction is rooted<p>It has also been granted me to learn from experience that falsities very deeply imprinted, whatever they may be, indeed dreadful falsities contrary to every Divine, human, and natural law, can hardly be rooted out in the other life, because they have taken root too deeply and have tainted the whole person. In regard to this, a dreadful thing happened that a certain spirit had done and about which he had thoroughly convinced himself that it was something everyone did. So when he had come into that thought, his conviction spread itself so widely that there was hardly anyone of those around me who did not imagine themselves guilty of the huge crime. The spirit was discovered, and he said that he had assumed that this was commonplace with many and that there was nothing evil in it, so he had been of that conviction.<p>About the same spirit it was also told that he is otherwise kind and brings evil on no one, but when in the conviction that this was not a great crime, he is like those who are insane in the life of the body who labor with that kind of insanity of not allowing themselves to be convinced when immersed in certain falsities, even dreadful ones. 1748, 11 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2787</h4><p>2787. THAT PERSUASIONS CAN WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY BE ERADICATED IN THE OTHER LIFE, AND INDEED ACCORDING AS THE PERSUASION IS MORE DEEPLY AND WIDELY ROOTED. <p>It was also granted to learn from experience, that falsities [which are] deeply imprinted whatever they are, yea dire [falsities] opposed to [contra] every Divine, human and natural law, can hardly be eradicated in the other life, because they have taken deep root and imbued the whole [man] in that respect [quoad id]. There occurred a certain dreadful thing which a certain spirit did, and whereof he was wholly persuaded that it was familiar to [common with] all. Wherefore when he came into such a thought his persuasion immediately spread so widely that there was scarcely anyone around me who did not suppose himself to be guilty of [that] great crime: the spirit was found [discovered], and he said that he supposed it familiar to [common with] all, and there was no evil therein. Wherefore he was in that persuasion. It was also related concerning the same spirit that in other respects he is modest nor brings evil on anyone, but was in the persuasion of this great crime. In the life of the body there are some, who are as it were insane, who labor under that kind of insanity that they do not suffer themselves to be persuaded in certain falsities, yea dreadful [ones]. - 1748, August 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2787 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2787. Quod persuasiones in altera vita difficillime possint exstirpari, et quidem secundum persuasionis radicem profundiorem et latiorem<p>Ab experientia quoque discere datum est, quod falsitates, quaecunque sunt, altius impressae, imo dirae contra omnem legem Divinam, humanam et naturalem, in altera vita vix possint exstirpari, quia altius radicem egerunt, ac totum imbuerint, quoad id: obvenit dirum quoddam, quod spiritus quidam fecit, et in quo sibi persuasit prorsus, quod hoc esset familiare omnibus, quare cum in talem cogitationem ventum, ejus persuasio illico se diffundebat tam late, ut vix ullus esset, qui circum me, qui non putaret, quod magni facinoris reus esset {a}, inveniebatur spiritus, et dixit, quod putaverit id familiare fuisse multis, et nihil mali inesse, quare in persuasione ea fuit: de eodem spiritu narrabatur quoque, quod alioquin modestus sit, nec cuiquam malum inferat, sed in hujus magni facinoris persuasione, est <sup>1</sup></p><p>quasi {b} qui insani sunt, in vita corporis, qui eo insaniae genere llborant, quod se non persuaderi patiantur [cum] in certis falsitatibus, etiam diris. 1748, 11 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic manuscript; J.F.I.
