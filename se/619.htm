<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 619</h4><p>619. The difference between life in the body, and after bodily life<p>In the body there is a different life than afterwards. In the body, anyone can do well to enemies and to those whom they hate, for any worldly reason whatever, because they are governed by a variety of motives and loves pertaining to the world. Thus they are able to dissemble and call themselves friends, when yet they are enemies.<p>But this is not true of the other life, since everyone then behaves according to the character they had acquired. One who harbors hatred keeps on hating, until the hatred is wiped away by means of a purging process. Otherwise, if they try to pretend, as they did during bodily life, this is at once recognized, and in fact, out in the open. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 619</h4><p>619. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE IN THE BODY AND LIFE AFTER THE BODY <p>Life in the body is different from what it is afterwards; for in the body men can do good from any worldly cause whatever to those who are enemies, and to those whom they hate, for they are governed by a variety of worldly ends and loves. Thus they can simulate and call themselves friends, when nevertheless they are enemies. But not so in the other life where everyone acts from his acquired nature. He who hates, continues to hate until the hatred is abolished by modes of devastation. But if it is otherwise, or if they want to simulate as in the life of the body, it is at once known, and indeed manifestly. </p>
