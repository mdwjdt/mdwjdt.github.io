<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4586</h4><p>4586. That such things [as sickness] derive their cause from the spiritual world has been granted me to learn through much experience. This happened in such a way that there was never any doubt left. Such spirits had attached themselves to me often and for long periods and brought on torments and pains, or rather sicknesses. Where the spirits were was shown and what they were like. Spirits spoke with them, enabling me to find out where they came from. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4586</h4><p>4586. That such things derive their cause from the spiritual world, it was given me to know through much experience, which occurred that never anything might be left in doubt. Such spirits were often, and for a long time, attached to me, and they induced torments and pains, yea, even diseases. They were shown as to where they were, and of what quality they were; spirits spoke with them, and it was given me to know whence they came. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4586 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4586. Quod talia ducant causam ex mundo spirituali, hoc per multam experientiam datum est scire, quod factum est ita ut nusquam aliquod dubium sit relictum, tales spiritus mihi saepe et diu applicati sunt, et induxerunt cruciatus et dolores, imo etiam morbos, ostensi sunt ubinam essent, et quales essent, loquuti sunt spiritus cum illis, et cognoscere datum unde essent. </p>
