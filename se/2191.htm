<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2191</h4><p>2191. In the inward heaven there are different levels of angels<p>I have said that there are three heavens, specifically an inward one, a very inward one and an innermost, each at their own distinct level [<a href="1828.htm">1828</a>]. What these levels or degrees are may be seen elsewhere [<a href="5547.htm">5547-5551</a>]. These, however, are the general levels, and in each heaven also there are levels of happiness-likewise three, I presume, but not interrelated, of course, in the same way as the levels of the heavens in general.<p>We may assume that there are three because of the levels in the human body. Under the heading of bodily or bodily senses come touch, taste and smell. These differ in purity, <sup>1</sup>yet all three still belong to the bodily kingdom, being distinguished from each other by different qualities, as anyone may know who rightly weighs the matter. So much for the bodily aspects, or appetites.<p>As for spiritual aspects of the body or senses, these are also three in number, namely, the hearing, the eyesight, and imaginative sight. These lie at different levels, yet still come under the heading of earthly senses. The hearing is a merely bodily sense, while sight is an earthly one, and these [three] interrelate in the same way as the senses of touch, taste and smell. For the outside relates to the inside, but does not come inside except by dissolving. Its inward parts are what compose a thing. Consequently, they interrelate as composite to components. <sup>2</sup>1748, 4 June.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Perhaps meaning refinement of function.-Tr.<br><br>2.&nbsp;In the margin of this and the previous paragraph is the notation "The heavens interrelate with the senses of the body." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2191</h4><p>2191. THAT IN THE INTERIOR HEAVEN ARE DEGREES OF ANGELS. <p>It has been said that there are three heavens, to wit, an interior, more interior, and inmost, which are distinct from each other by degrees; of what quality these are, to wit, the degrees, may be seen elsewhere. But these degrees are in one class [in genere]. In every heaven also are given degrees of felicities, and, indeed, I think three, which are not so related to each other as the generic degrees of the heavens in one class. That there are three may be inferred from the degrees in the body. To the corporeal, or sensual-corporeal principle, are referred touches, tastes, and smells. These differ from each other in purity, and yet still all three are referred to the corporeal kingdom, and are distinguished from each other by other qualities, as must be known to everyone who rightly weighs the matter. Thus much as regards the corporeals, or appetites. As regards the spirituals of the body, or the sensuals, there are also three, to wit, hearing, ocular sight, and the sight of the imagination, which differ from each other by degrees, but yet referred to naturals; hearing is merely sensual-corporeal, and sight sensual-natural, and similarly are related to each other the senses of touch, taste, and smell; for that which is exterior is referred to what is interior, nor can it reach the interior except by a dissolving, or it is its interiors which compose it; therefore the relation is the same as between a compound and its components. - 1748, June 4. [Marginal reading.] The heavens correspond to the senses in the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2191 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2191. Quod in coelo interiori sint gradus angelorum<p>Dictum est, quod tres coeli sint, nempe interius, intimius, et intimum, qui inter se quoad gradus distincti sunt [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2191/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1828" target=_top>1828</a>], qui quales sunt, nempe gradus, alibi videatur [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2191/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5547" target=_top>5547-5551</a>]: sed hi gradus sunt in genere, in quovis coelo quoque dantur gradus felicitatum, et quidem, ut autumo, tres, qui se inter se non quidem ita <sup>1</sup></p><p>habent, sicut gradus coelorum in genere. Quod tres sint, autumare licet a gradibus in corpore, ad corporeum seu sensuale corporeum referuntur tactus, gustus et olfactus, hi inter se differunt puritate, et tamen usque ad corporeum regnum omnes tres referuntur, et distinguuntur inter se per alias qualitates, ut notum esse potest unicuique qui rite perpendit: haec quoad corporea seu appetitus; quoad spiritualia corporis seu sensualia, sunt quoque tres, nempe auditus, visus ocularis, et visus imaginationis, qui inter se gradibus differunt, sed usque ad naturalia referenda, mere sensuale corporeum est auditus, at sensuale naturale est visus, et similiter se habent ac sensus tactus, gustus et olfactus inter se-nam <sup>2</sup></p><p>quod exterius est se refert ad interius, nec ad interius venit nisi per solutionem, vel ea sunt interiora ejus quae [id] componunt-proinde <sup>3</sup></p><p>sicut se habet compositum, ad componentia. 1748, 4 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript ita semideletum est<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has se, nam<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has componunt, proinde </p>
