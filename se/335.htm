<p>335.当阅读大卫诗篇时，它们在天上具有这种能力，一些天堂天使惊讶得呆住了。几段大卫诗篇被阅读，事实上以这种方式被阅读，蒙弥赛亚神怜悯，越来越内在的意义转到一些天堂天使的觉知那里。他们如此惊讶，以至于大声说，他们从来不信这类事物在自己里面；甚至死人在死后的生活中也被惊讶到了，因为圣言以同样的方式影响到他们。为叫这种不同能被发现，圣言的字义也几乎如同他们在世时那样被展示给他们；当读到同样的内容时，意义变得如此不同，以致他们几乎感知不到任何天堂的生命。由此可推断当弥赛亚神出于怜悯复活圣言时，圣言里面蕴含哪种能力；以及当文字如同死去时，如被死人阅读时的情形，它又是什么样子。（1747年12月13日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 335</h4><p>335. When the Psalms of David were read, they had such power in heaven, that some heavenly [angels] were struck with amazement<p>Several psalms of David were read, and indeed, in such a way that the inward and more inward levels of meaning were conveyed, by the mercy of God the Messiah, to the perception of certain heavenly [angels]. They were so struck with amazement as to declare aloud that they had never believed such things [were in them] - as did also those who were dead in the life after death, because the Word had similarly affected them.<p>In order that the difference could be observed, the meaning of the Word was brought to them just about as it had been in their lifetime when the same things were read, and this was so different that they had seen in it hardly any heavenly life at all.<p>From this one may infer what kind of power there is in the Word, when God the Messiah mercifully enlivens it; and what kind when the letter is as if dead, as it is when read by the dead. 1747, the 13th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 335</h4><p>335. THAT WHEN THE PSALMS OF DAVID WERE READ, THEY HAD SUCH EFFECT IN HEAVEN THAT CERTAIN HEAVENLY BEINGS COULD NOT BUT BE AMAZED <p>Some Psalms of David were read, and this in such a manner that by the mercy of God Messiah the interior and more interior senses were transferred into the perception of certain heavenly beings, who were so amazed that they declared with a loud voice that they never would have believed such things; even the dead, in the life after death, [were astonished] because with them also the Word operated in a similar manner. And in order that the difference might be observed, the [literal] sense of the Word was also brought forth for them, almost such as it had been in their life; when similar things were read, the sense was so different that they thence perceived scarcely anything whatever of heavenly life. Hence it can be concluded what efficacy is within the Word when God Messiah from mercy vivifies it; also what it is like when the letter is, as it were, dead, as when it is read by those who are dead. 1747, Dec. 13. </p>
