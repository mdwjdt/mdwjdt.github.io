<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3899</h4><p>3899. What they become thereafter, I was given to learn, namely, that once they have become captivated by such an extremely foul enjoyment, they then care nothing for, but rather loathe men, and thus the natural modes of conjunction. Consequently they also loathe and nauseate matrimonies, by which if they enter into them they are moved by no pleasure, so that marriage love with such women has been lost and become something disgusting, so that they can seldom have offspring, and if they do, they do not love them, for this follows from the destruction of marriage love. They love only their foul passions, which soothe and fill their mind with most obscene delight. Many of them become the vilest prostitutes, and are then more filthy than all others, because they care nothing for decency or outer restraint, having put away from themselves all shame. Therefore, because they are not captivated by any other excitement, they have lost all the pleasure otherwise associated with making love. That this is the case, I was given to see clearly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3899</h4><p>3899. What they afterwards became it was given to me to know, viz., that being captivated with such base delight they care nothing for, but loathe, the men, and thus all natural modes of connection, whence also they loathe and nauseate matrimonies, which if the enter to they are moved by no pleasure, and thus conjugial love is lost with them and turned to loathing, wherefore they can rarely have offspring, and if they have, they do not love them, for this follows from the destruction of conjugial love. [They love] only their vile cupidities which soothe and occupy the mind with a foul delight many of them become the vilest prostitutes, and they are then viler than all others, for they care nothing for decency or any external bond, all shame with them being put away; wherefore as they are prompted by no other than such a kind of stimulus, they have lost all that is otherwise pleasurable in sexual intercourse. That such is the fact was [clearly] perceived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3899 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3899. Quomodo tales fiunt postea, mihi scire datum, nempe cum tali jucunditate foedissima captae sunt, tunc nihil curant, sed fastidiunt viros, et sic naturales conjunctionis modos, proinde etiam fastidiunt et nauseant matrimonia, quae si contrahunt, nulla voluptate feruntur, sic deperditus apud eas amor conjugialis, et nauseabundus factus, quare raro quoque prolem habere possunt, quam si haberent, nec amant, nam hoc sequitur a deleto amore conjugiali, solum foedas suas cupiditates, quae animum jucunditate foedissima mulcent, et occupant: pleraeque earum foedissima fiunt prostibula, et tunc sunt foediores quam omnes alii, nam nihil curant decorum aut vinculum externum, rejecto apud eas omni pudore, quare quia nullo alio aestro quam tali capiuntur, perdiderunt omne id voluptuosum quod venereum secum alioquin habet: quod ita se habeat, perceptum. </p>
