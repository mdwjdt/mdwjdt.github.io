<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3981</h4><p>3981. Being let back into a state [of pondering] what faith is in general, the aura was one of bare gazing alone, without anything definite, thus a mixed one pertaining to all spirits - an aura of gazing alone. But still they were speaking, yet saying that they did not know whether they were speaking, or what they were saying. It was then said that when the mental imagery is fixed on matters of faith, such as the confession of faith, then perhaps it would be different, but it still remained as it was, only a staring, which cannot be described, thus a mixed and general one as before. It was said that when they were praying, reading and performing other expressions of faith, and not thinking about faith alone without works, that it is not right, which is the truth, because now their mental image is fixed, the least words that are being read are such that it is fixed upon the matters of faith - quite differently than when they are wondering what faith is, still more what faith alone is, still more that there can be faith without works. This shows what kind of idea many, and most, and also the defender had had of faith and the tenets of faith, as if they were only looking at them, or thinking of them, thus an aerial faith, or no faith, which vanishes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3981</h4><p>3981. Being remitted into the state of faith in general, the sphere was that of a bare intuition, without anything determinate, as everything of spirit being thus diffused there resulted such a sphere of simple intuition. Still, however, they spoke, but said they did not know whether they spoke, or what they said. It was then remarked, that when the idea is determined to the things of faith, as to a confession of faith, that perhaps the case might be different, yet still such an impression remained; it was barely an intuition which cannot be described, so diffusive and general was it, just as before. It was said that when they prayed or read, or did other similar things appropriate to faith, and did not think concerning faith alone without works, that the case was not so, which indeed was true, because there was then something determinate. All the particulars which are read are such as are terminated in the things of faith. But altogether different is the process when they think of what faith is, and more when they think of faith alone, and still more, if they think of faith as entirely separate from works. Hence it appears what an idea many, nay, the most, and among others this defender, had concerning faith and its properties, viz. that it was solely their intuition or their thought, thus an aerial faith which vanishes as a thing of naught. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3981 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3981. Missus in statum [cogitandi] quid fides in communi, sphaera erat, sicut solum intuitio sola, absque ullo determinato, et sic diffusa omnium spirituum, sphaera solius intuitionis erat; sed usque loquebantur, sed dicebant se non scire, an loquerentur, quid loquerentur; tunc dictum, quod cum determinatur idea in ea quae sunt fidei, ut in confessionem fidei, quod forte aliter esset, sed usque manebat talis, erat solum intuitiva, quae describi nequit, sic diffusa et communis ut prius: dictum cum orarent, legerent, et similia quae fidei sunt, et non cogitent de sola fide absque operibus, quod ita non sit, quod verum, quia tunc determinatur [idea], singula quae leguntur, sunt talia ut terminetur in iis, quae sunt fidei, aliter prorsus ac cum cogitant quid fides, magis quid fides sola, adhuc magis quod sit fides absque operibus, exinde constitit, quam ideam multi et plerique, tum is qui defensor fuit, habuerunt de fide et iis quae sunt fidei, quod solum essent intuitio eorum, seu cogitatio eorum, sic fides aerea, et nulla, quae evanescit. </p>
