<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1397</h4><p>1397. There are people like this in military service, who love nothing but slaughter and looting, taking pleasure in these alone. However, with those who do this from duty, thinking of those they kill as the enemy, thus who do so on command, the case is different. Some of these I have also met who are among the more blessed, even though they had been soldiers. But it is the inward qualities that condemn in the other life, that is, what a person's intention is, or as they say, what he is of his own free will. 1748, 15 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1397</h4><p>1397. They are like those in military service who love nothing but slaughter and spoils, and are delighted solely in such things. But it is different with those who do this from duty, regarding them as enemies, and thus acting from command; I have also met some of them who, although they were soldiers, were among the more blessed. Interior things are what condemn in the other life, namely, the quality of the "animus", or as they say, the quality of the will. 1748, Mar. 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1397 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1397. Similes sunt ii in militia, qui nihil amant nisi caedes, et spolia, et iis delectantur unice, at vero qui ex debito hoc faciunt, quia eos ut hostes cogitant, sic ex mandatis, [cum iis] aliter se res habet, quorum aliquos etiam conveni, qui inter beatiores sunt, tametsi milites, sed interiora sunt, quae damnant in altera vita, qualis nempe animus, seu ut vocant qualis voluntas. 1748, 15 Martius. </p>
