<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>253.和世人一样，灵人也会通过反思获得许多习惯。除了其它经历外，我还发现，意图向世人行恶的恶灵还获得在不知不觉的情况下把邪恶带给人的习惯。例如，每当他们听见马车，或马车的声音时，在不知不觉，好像对它完全没有意识的情况下，他们试图强迫我仰向马车；除此之外还有其它例子，它们突然流入他们的脑海，只是出于习惯；不过，没有必要讲述这些经历。今天，以及之前，我发现龙正习惯于他以前从未实施过的欺骗，由此受到严厉惩罚，免得这些事增添他邪恶的本性。（1748年8月底）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 253</h4><p>253. Spirits also, like people on earth, acquire many habits reflexively<p>Besides other experiences, it has also been observed that evil spirits, who are ever intent upon doing evil to us, also acquire the habit of bringing evil upon people unwittingly. For example, whenever they hear a carriage, or the sound of a carriage, then unconsciously, as if unaware of it, they attempt to force me toward the carriage - among other things also that stream suddenly into their minds, solely from habit; but it is needless to recount the experiences.<p>(Today also, and previously, I found out that the dragon was learning deceptions that he had not practiced before, and was therefore severely punished, lest they add to his [evil] nature.) <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This postscript was probably written at the end of August, 1748, about which see 2967-68. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 253</h4><p>253. THAT SPIRITS ALSO, LIKE MAN, BY REFLECTION ARE IMBUED WITH MANY THINGS FROM USAGE <p>In addition to other experiences, it was also observed that evil spirits, who continually intend evil to man, are also imbued from usage to bring evil upon man unexpectedly. Thus, as often as they hear a carriage or the sound of a carriage, then, unexpectedly, as if not aware of it, they try to force me towards the carriage, besides other examples also, which suddenly inflow into their mind from usage alone. To recount these experiences is superfluous. <p>Today, and before also, I learnt that the dragon was becoming accustomed to deceits which he had not formerly practiced, on which account he was grievously punished, lest those things should be added to his nature. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph was written in the vacant space between nos. 253 and 254. The word hodie (today) suggests that it was added when Swedenborg was making the Index, at the end of August 1748. It is entered there (s.v. Natura) as follows: <p>"That certain evil spirits learn evils which afterwards they do as it were from their nature, and so they can render their nature worse." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 253 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>253. Quod etiam spiritus per reflexionem imbuantur ex usu multis sicut homo<p>Praeter alias experientias, etiam observatum est, quod spiritus mali, qui jugiter malum homini intendunt, etiam imbuantur ex usu, malum inopinato inferre homini, sicut quod quoties currum aut sonitum currus audiunt, tunc inopinato, quasi id non sentientes, me versus currum agere tentant, praeter alia quoque, quae in eorum mentem subito influunt solum ex usu, experientias allegare supervacuum est; (hodie quoque et prius didici quod draco assuesceret <sup>1</sup></p><p>dolis, quos prius non fecerit, quare punitus graviter, ne adderent ea ad naturam suam.) <sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
