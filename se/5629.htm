<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5629</h4><p>5629. <sup>1</sup>About Babylon, and about the most cunning there and the seven mountains<p>I spoke with Englishmen, and asked where the way that they are comes from, namely, that when they hear truths, they see them and follow them, and then easily bring themselves into conformity. [I asked this] because in the other life a snowy whiteness appears with them that is above what is earthly and is composed of heavenly light; it also comes from the fact that they are intelligent. The Dutch are like this too; however this whiteness does not appear with them, but in their earthly aspect there is a certain resoluteness, on which account they are also not as quick. I spoke with the Englishmen about where the sort of whiteness they had come from and the sort of life that differs from the life of all other nations as they perceived. The opportunity then offered itself to make a comparison between government as it is with them and as it is with the Italians today, the governments are entirely opposite and as a consequence their natures are different. In England there is freedom to speak and to write about both civil and Ecclesiastical matters. However, there is no freedom whatsoever to cheat others using deception and cunning, or to lie in ambush to murder, to rob, or to kill. The former [freedom] and the latter [prohibitions] are common there, but with the people of Italy it is the opposite. There is an almost total freedom to cheat using cunning and deception, and also to kill, on which account there are so many sanctuaries. But there is no freedom at all to speak and to write about things contrary to Ecclesiastical matters, nor about civil affairs, for there are inquisitions there. Thus it is that the people of Italy keep it all inside, and the ones who are inwardly evil hold back in themselves a fire that is hatred, revenge, and cruelty, a fire like that which lies hidden under the ashes and continues after the burning. But with the people of England it is otherwise: because they are permitted to speak and to write freely, such fire is not kept hidden but immediately flames up and flames out. And they are kept being sincere by its not being permissible for them to rob and to kill, for then there would be no remission [of sins].<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Paragraph 5628 is missing in the original manuscript. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5629</h4><p>5629. <sup>1</sup>ABOUT BABYLON AND THE EXCEEDINGLY CRAFTY THERE: AND ABOUT THE SEVEN MOUNTAINS. <p>I spoke with Englishmen, and inquired whence it was that they were such, namely, that when they hear truths, they see them and follow them, and that, then, they are apt at conforming themselves; for, with them, in the other life, there appears a whiteness which is above their natural and which is of heavenly light: from this also it is that they are intelligent. Likewise, the Dutch; but, with these, the whiteness does not appear, but a certain solidity in their natural; wherefore, also, they are more tenacious. I spoke with the English, asking whence they have such whiteness - also, such a life; which differs, as they perceived, from the life of all other nations. It was then permitted me to set up a comparison between the government which was among them and among the present-day Italians; which governments are perfect opposites: thence, also, it is that their geniuses differ. In England, there is liberty of speech and of writing about both civil and ecclesiastical questions; but no liberty whatever of cheating others, of employing deceits and craft, nor of assassinating, nor of robbery, nor of slaughter; and this [restraint] and that [liberty] are there general. But it is the opposite among the Italians; there, there is almost entire liberty of cheating, by cunning and deceit, and also of killing, on account of there being so many places of sanctuary, but none whatever of speaking and writing about ecclesiastical questions per contra; neither about civil [abuses]; for they have inquisitions there. Hence it is, that the Italian race keeps all things within; and those of them who are evil, retain a fire inwardly in themselves, which is hatred, revenge, ferocity; which fire also is like that which lies concealed under the ashes after a conflagration, and smoulders. But the English race differently. With them, such fire is not concealed but instantly flares up and burns out, because it is conceded to them to speak and write freely, and, because they are kept in sincerity and justice, by means of its not being permitted them to cheat, to rob and to slay; for in such cases there is no pardon. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No. 5628 is skipped in the Latin. -ED. </p>

Loquutus cum Anglis, unde illis tale niveum, ac talis vita, quae differt a vita aliarum nationum omnium, ut perciperent, tunc instituere dabatur comparationem inter regimen apud illos, et apud Italos hodie, quod regimina prorsus opposita sint, et quod inde genii differant, in Anglia est libertas loquendi et scribendi, tam de civilibus quam de Ecclesiasticis, at prorsus nulla libertas fallendi alios, utendi dolis et astu, nec insidiandi ad necem, nec latrocinandi, nec occidendi, et quod hoc et illud commune ibi sit, at oppositum est apud Italos, ibi paene omne libertas fallendi, astu et dolo, et quoque occidendi, propter tot asyla, sed prorsus nulla loquendi et scribendi de Ecclesiasticis contra illa, nec de civilibus, nam inquisitiones ibi; inde est quod Italica gens intus teneat omnia, et qui eorum mali sunt intus in se retineant ignem, qui est odium, vindicta, saevitia, qui ignis est quasi ille qui post incendium latet sub cinere, et durat; at Anglica gens aliter, quia concessum est illis libere loqui et scribere, quod ignis talis non recondatur, sed illico flagrat et deflagrat, et quod in sincero et justo teneantur per id quod non liceat illis fallere, latrocinari, et occidere, nam tunc nulla remissio.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;5628 deest </p>
