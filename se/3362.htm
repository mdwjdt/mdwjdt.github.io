<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3362</h4><p>3362. Good spirits kept on saying that [those spirits] are let in to work into the right part of the head, not into the left, and from the right part of the head into the left side of the thorax, but by no means into the left side of the head-in which case, they said, I would be lost. They were speaking about this for such a long time, as said before, to the point of weariness and irritation. I considered that it would do no harm if I spoke with [those spirits]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3362</h4><p>3362. (The good spirits were continually saying that [these evil spirits] are allowed to operate into the right part of the head, not into the left, and from the right part of the head into the left side of the thorax; [but] by no means into the left of the head, [for if] so, they said that I would be destroyed [ruined]. This they were so long speaking, as was said, to [my] fatigue, and a sort of indignation, supposed if I spoke with them, no injury would result). </p>
