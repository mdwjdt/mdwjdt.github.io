<p>203.关于灵人和天使觉知那些在肉体和世界中的事物时所在的状态。天使和灵人在世人里面的状态是这样：他们无法觉知低级领域里的任何事物，除非在那些朝向天堂的大门被打开的人里面。这种人能专注于内在事物，因为他的感官从外在事物中退出了。天使和灵人之所以能在这种情况下感知这类事物，是因为那时它们或多或少地吸引了人的觉知，这人通过有意识地反映这些事物，如同邀请他们去觉知在他们之外的周围事物而将它们传给灵人和天使。这一点已被数不清的经历所证实。因此，天使和灵人感知不到凡来自人类的任何东西，除非他们被弥赛亚神赋予这种能力。至于能使他们觉知的这种反映，有许多事将不得不说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 203</h4><p>203. About the condition in which spirits and angels perceive things that are in the body and in the world<p>The condition of angels and spirits in people on earth is such that they cannot perceive any of the things that are in the lower realms, except in those persons to whom the gate into heaven has been opened. Such a person can devote himself to inner matters, when the senses have been withdrawn from outer ones.<p>The reason why the angels and spirits in this case do perceive things is that they then more or less attract perceptions, and the person on earth passes these on to them by consciously mirroring the things, as if inviting them to perceive the surroundings. This has been verified by numerous instances.<p>So angels and spirits perceive nothing whatever from humans, except insofar as they are given that ability by God the Messiah. As for the reflecting that enables them to perceive, much would have to be told about it. 1747, the 4th day of October (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 203</h4><p>203. CONCERNING THE STATE OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS IN PERCEIVING THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE IN THE BODY AND THE WORLD <p>The state of angels and spirits in men is such that they can perceive nothing of those things that are in lower spheres, except only in those persons with whom the gate into heaven is opened. Then the man can concern himself with internal things, his senses having been withdrawn from things external. The angels and spirits can then perceive such things because they then as it were attract man's perceptions, and he communicates them to the spirits and angels by his reflections, which are as it were invitations to perceive those things which are outside of them. This has been confirmed by very many experiences. Wherefore angels and spirits perceive nothing whatever from human beings except so far as the opportunity is granted them by God Messiah. As regards the reflections by which they are enabled to perceive, many things will have to be said. 1747, Oct. 4, o.s. </p>

De spirituum et angelorum statu percipiendi <sup>1</sup></p><p>ea quae sunt in corpore et in mundo<p>Status angelorum et spirituum in hominibus, est, ut nihil possint percipere ab iis, quae sunt in sphaeris inferioribus, solum in iis, quibus porta in coelum aperta est, tunc vacare potest homo internis, abductis sensibus ab externis; quod tunc percipiant angeli et spiritus, in causa est, quod ii tunc attrahant quasi perceptiones, et homo cum iis communicet eas per reflexiones, quae sunt quasi invitationes ad percipiendum ea, quae extra eos sunt, hoc permultis confirmatum est, quare angeli et spiritus nihil prorsus percipiunt ab humanis, nisi quantum a Deo Messia, iis datur copia; quod ad reflexionem ut percipiant, multa dicenda forent. 1747, die 4 Oct. st. v.<p>1 sic J.F.I.
