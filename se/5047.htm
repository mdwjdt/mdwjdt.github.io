<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5047</h4><p>5047. I realized that such as are motivated by a desire to command and are inwardly evil are thrust down into that hell immediately after their death in the world so that they can purged there. Up to this point most have been purged in the world of spirits over the course of many years, because all purging is done from the head to the heel, concerning which elsewhere of the Lord's Divine Mercy.<p>I realized that unless this had been done, scarcely any from that nation could have been saved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5047</h4><p>5047. It was perceived that such as are strongly possessed by the lust of ruling, and are interiorly evil, are to be cast down into that hell immediately after their death in the world, in order that they may there be vastated; for, up to this point, very many are vastated in the world of spirits, and this for many years; for all vastation takes place from head to heel - whereof, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, I shall treat elsewhere. (It was perceived that unless this had happened, scarcely anyone from that nation could have been saved.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5047 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5047. Perceptum, quod tales qui perciti sunt cupidine imperandi, ac interius mali sunt, in id infernum statim post mortem eorum in mundo, dejiciendi sint, ut ibi devastentur, nam eo usque plerique in mundo spirituum devastati sunt, et hoc per plures annos, nam omnis devastatio fit a capite ad calcem, de qua alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia. Perceptum nisi hoc factum esset, quod vix ullus ex illa natione potuisset salvari. </p>
