<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5180</h4><p>5180. There was a certain one who had faith in the sense of the letter of the Word and thought he had marriage within him because he had lived honorably with his wife and had never lusted promiscuously, because marriage corresponds to the Word, for this is a Divine and a heavenly Marriage. Consequently he was brought to [this heaven]. He was able to see naked women without a lascivious feeling. But they told them to take off his clothes, which he did, and he was then quite able to be with those who were lower down. But when he went up naked and came to those who were on a higher-level there, he was deprived of his senses, first of hearing and speaking, then of sight, and lastly of touch, and in this condition was as it were half-dead. Nevertheless he was taken to his place. Such are those who believe the Word in respect to its literal sense, and who do not know more inward truths and soak them in. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5180</h4><p>5180. There was a certain one who had a faith in the sense of the letter of the Word, and supposed himself to possess the conjugial [quality], because he had lived chastely with his wife, and never conducted himself lasciviously. Inasmuch as the conjugial [state] corresponds with the Word, for the Word is the Divine and heavenly conjugial, therefore he was brought to this place. He was able, without a feeling of lasciviousness, to look on naked women; but they told him that he must strip off his clothes, which, also, he did; and, then, he was indeed able to be with those who were in a lower [sphere]; but he ascended naked to those who were in a higher [sphere]; and, when he came thither, he was deprived of his senses, first, those of hearing and speech, then that of sight, and at length that of touch; and thus he remained, like one half-dead; but, still, he was taken away to his own place. Such are they who believe the Word, as to the sense of its letter, and do not know, and have not imbibed, interior truths from it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5180 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5180. Erat quidam, qui fidem habuit sensui literae Verbi, et putabat se conjugiale habere, quia cum uxore sua vixerat, sincere, et quod nec lasciviverit usquam, quia conjugiale correspondet Verbo, nam hoc est Conjugiale Divinum et coeleste, ideo ille adductus est; is potuit absque emotione lasciviae videre nudas, sed dicebant ei quod exueret vestes, quod etiam faciebat, ac tunc potuit quidem cum illis esse, qui inferius erant, sed nudus ascendebat ad illos qui in aliori, et illuc cum venit, deprivatus est sensibus suis, primum auditu et loquela, dein visu, et tandem tactu, et sic constitit sicut semimortuus, sed usque devectus est ad locum suum, tales sunt qui Verbum credunt quoad sensum literae ejus, et non interiora vera inde sciunt et imbuerunt. </p>
