<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6090</h4><p>6090. About Language, or spiritual speech<p>That spiritual language, or rather speech, has nothing at all in common with human languages was evident to me from the words of this language which are unintelligible to any earthly person, and yet every person comes into this language after death of him- or herself, so it is implanted in his spiritual person, not however in the natural, as can be demonstrated from these two words: they say vita vella which means Ԍet them be far off and depart quickly!" and from scapuleja, which means ԃast [him] outside!" I have not yet learned where the words of that language come from. They draw the words not from the sound of a feeling, but from the meaning of their vowels and consonants; the ideas of their thought fall into such expressions of their lips. Their writing differs from their spoken language. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6090</h4><p>6090. SPIRITUAL LANGUAGE OR SPEECH. <p>That spiritual language, or speech, has nothing at all in common with human languages, was manifest to me from the words of that language, which cannot be in the least understood by any man; and yet, nevertheless, every man comes into that language, after death, of his own accord; so that it is implanted in his spiritual man, but not in the natural. This may be evident from these two words - they say, vita vella, which signifies, Let him be afar off and depart quickly; and from the word, scapuleja, which signifies, to cast out of doors. I have not yet been taught whence the words of that language originate. They take up the words, not from the sound of affection, but from the significations of the vowels and consonants: the ideas of thought fall into such unfoldings of the lips. - Their writing differs from the speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6090 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6090. De Lingua seu loquela spirituali<p>Quod lingua seu loquela spiritualis prorsus nihil commune habeat cum linguis humanis, patuit mihi a vocibus illius linguae, quae prorsus non intelligibiles sunt alicui homini, et usque tamen omnis homo in illam linguam post mortem venit, ex se, sic ut insita sit spirituali ejus homini, non autem naturali, ut ex his binis vocibus constare potest, dicunt vita vella, quod significat "ut procul sit, et abeat cito," et ex voce scapuleja, quod significat " ejice foras, " nondum edoctus sum, unde linguae istius voces sunt, hauriunt voces non ex sono affectionis, sed ex vocalium et literarum significationibus, cadunt ideae cogitationis in tales labiorum explicationes. Discrepat scriptura illorum a lingua. </p>
