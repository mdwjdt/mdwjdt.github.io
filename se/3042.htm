<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3042</h4><p>3042. About the dragon<p>A custom familiar to him when he wants to call the Jews together and then together with them persecute the faithful, is that he seems to himself to depart toward old Jerusalem, which is a little to the left, quite far away, below. Then he says one thing, sometimes without any deceit, and thinks something else. By the inward parts of his nature or his thoughts, he speaks with the Jews, but by his speech, with someone else. This is the sign of his deceit, and whoever knows him knows this at once, both from his speaking, and from the place where he is. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3042</h4><p>3042. CONCERNING THE DRAGON. <p>It is a familiar habit with him, when he wishes to assemble the Jews, and so with them persecute the faithful, he seems to himself to go away towards the old Jerusalem, which is to the left, a little farther away [distance] below; he then, sometimes without any deceit, speaks one thing and thinks another; by means of the interiors of his nature or thought, he speaks with the Jews; by means of speech, [speaks] with another, which is a proof of his deceit, and he, to whom he is known, immediately knows it, as well from the speech, as the place where he is. </p>

De dracone<p>Mos ei familiaris est, cum convocare vult Judaeos, et sic cum iis persequi fideles, abire sibi videtur versus veterem Hierosolymam <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quae ad sinistrum paulum, longius, infra, tunc loquitur aliud quandoque absque ullo dolo, et aliud cogitat; per interiora naturae ejus seu cogitationes <sup>2</sup></p><p>loquitur cum Judaeis, per loquelam cum alio, quod indicium est, ejus doli, et <sup>3</sup></p><p>is, cui notus est, illico novit id tam ex loquela, quam ex loco, ubi est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Hierosolymam ut apparet<p>2.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
