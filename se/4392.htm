<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4392</h4><p>4392. About the general and the particular: one who looks from a general sees the particulars, but one who looks from a particular does not see the general<p>With spirits I spoke at length about how one must think from general principles, and from them look into particulars, and that then one sees all the particulars one knows as if below oneself how they fit in, agree, disagree, are to be understood, accepted, rejected - whereas one who from particulars looks at generals goes astray in regard to every subject of contemplation, for particulars persuade. For example, if someone places the country's security in this or that, there are very many particulars that persuade in favor of a different course, to which the person holds fast, and not knowing what is best for the country's security, adopts harmful measures. This was illustrated by many examples, and confirmed by angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4392</h4><p>4392. CONCERNING THE GENERAL AND THE PARTICULAR; THOSE WHO FROM THE GENERAL SEE THE PARTICULARS AND THOSE WHO FROM THE PARTICULAR DO NOT SEE THE GENERAL.<p>I have spoken much with spirits as to the manner in which thought flows from general principles, and particulars are thence viewed, and that, one then sees all the particulars of which he has any knowledge as if below himself, observing how they coincide, agree, [or] disagree; how they are to be understood, accepted, or rejected; whereas he who looks at generals from particulars, goes astray in every object of his contemplation, for particulars persuade. If anyone, for example, places the safety of his country in this thing or that, there are very many particulars which persuade otherwise, in which he thus remains, and knowing not what constitutes the safety of his country adopts hurtful measures. This was illustrated by many examples, and was confirmed by the angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4392 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4392. De communi et particulari, qui ex communi videt particularia, at qui ex particulari non videt commune.<p>Cum spiritibus multum loquutus sum, quomodo ex communibus principiis cogitandum, et inde particularia intuenda, et quod tunc videat omnia particularia, quorum cognitionem habet, tanquam infra se, quomodo coincidunt, concordant, discordant, intelligenda, acceptanda, rejicienda; at qui ex particularibus spectat communia, in quovis objecto intuitionum aberrat, nam particularia persuadent, ut pro exemplo qui patriae salutem in hoc aut illo ponit, sunt permulta particularia quae persuadent aliter, in quibus sic manet et nescit salutem patriae, et iniqua consilia init: hoc illustratum est pluribus exemplis, et confirmatum ab angelis. </p>
