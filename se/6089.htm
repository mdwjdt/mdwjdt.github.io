<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6089</h4><p>6089. About the Council of Trent<p>This council decreed by a Bull confirmed on Nov. 13, 1564:<p>1. ) That Sacred Scriptures must be explained and interpreted by no others than the Church.<p>2. ) That the seven sacraments are Baptism, confirmation, the Eucharist, repentance, extreme unction, order, and marriage.<p>3. ) In the Eucharist there is truly, really, and substantially the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and there is a conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the body and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood, which they call conversion and transubstantiation.<p>4. ) Souls detained in purgatory are benefited by the suffrages of friends.<p>5. ) That the saints reigning together with Christ should be venerated and called upon.<p>6. ) Honor and veneration are to be paid to images.<p>7. ) That the Pope is the successor of Peter, the chief of the apostles, and the vicar of Jesus Christ. The following are from the bull:<p>The saints reigning together with Christ offer their own prayers for men to God, and therefore it is good and profitable to imploringly call upon them and, for procuring benefits from God through His Son Jesus Christ who is our only redeemer and savior, to have recourse to their prayers, assistance and help; but those think wickedly who deny that the saints, enjoying eternal happiness in heaven, are to be called upon, or who assert either that they do not pray for men, or that [the invoking] of them to pray for even each one of us is idolatrous, or contradicts the Word of God and is opposed to the honor of the one Mediator of God and men, J. Christ, or that it is folly to entreat, orally or mentally, those who are reigning in heaven.<p>Concerning Justification by faith and sanctification by it, the Catholics entertain almost similar opinions with the reformed; there is not much difference. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6089</h4><p>6089. THE COUNCIL OF TRENT. <p>The decrees of that council were confirmed by bull, in 1564, in November of that year. <p>(1) That Holy Scripture is not to be explained and interpreted by any, save by the Church. <p>(2) That the seven Sacraments are, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Repentance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Matrimony. <p>(3) That the body and blood are truly, really, and substantially in the Eucharist, together with the soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that there takes place a turning of the whole substance of the bread into the body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood - which they call conversion and transubstantiation. <p>(4) That souls detained in purgatory are benefited by the suffrages of friends. <p>(5) That the saints reigning with Christ should be venerated and invoked. <p>(6) That honors and veneration are to be paid to images. <p>(7) That the Pope is the successor of Peter, the chief of the apostles, and the Vicar of Jesus Christ. The following are from the bull: <p>That the saints reigning with Christ, offer their prayers for men to God, and that it is for this reason good and profitable to invoke them in prayer, and, on account of the benefits obtained from God by His Son Jesus Christ, who is our only Redeemer and Savior, to have recourse to their prayers, assistance and help; but that those think wickedly who deny that the saints enjoying eternal happiness in heaven are to be invoked, or who assert, either that they do not pray for men, or that the invoking of them to pray also for each one of us is idolatrous, or that it is repugnant to the Word of God and opposed to the honor of the one Mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ, or that it is folly to supplicate, orally or mentally, those who are reigning in heaven. Concerning Justification by faith, and Sanctification by it, the Catholics entertain almost similar opinions with the Reformed. There is not much difference. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6089 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6089. De Concilio Tridentino<p>Concilii illius decreta per Bullam confirmata 1564 id. Nov.<p>1) quod scriptura sacra non ab aliis explicanda et interpretanda quam ab Ecclesia.<p>2) Quod septem sacramenta sint, Baptismus, confirmatio, eucharistia, poenitentia, extrema unctio, ordo et matrimonium.<p>3) In Eucharistia esse vere, realiter et substantialiter corpus et sanguinem, una cum anima et divinitate D. n. Jesu Christi, et fieri conversionem totius substantiae panis in corpus, et totius substantiae vini in sanguinem, quam conversionem et transsubstantiationem vocant.<p>4) Animas in purgatorio detentas sodalium suffragiis juvari.<p>5) Quod sancti una cum Christo regnantes, venerandi atque invocandi sint.<p>6) Honorem impertiendum esse et venerationem imaginibus. [7)] Quod Papa sit successor Petri apostolorum principis, et Jesu Christi vicarius. Haec ex bulla.<p>[2] Quod sancti, una cum Christo regnantes, orationes suas pro hominibus Deo offerant, et quod inde bonum et utile sit suppliciter illos invocare, et ob beneficia impetranda a Deo per Filium ejus Jesum Christum, qui Solus noster redemptor et salvator est, ad eorum orationes, opem et auxilium confugere; illos vero qui negant, sanctos aeterna felicitate in coelo fruentes, invocandos esse, vel qui asserunt, vel illos pro hominibus non orare, vel eorum, ut pro nobis etiam singulis orent, invocationem esse idololatricam, vel pugnare cum Verbo Dei, et adversari honori unius Mediatoris Dei et hominum J. Christi, vel stultum esse, in coelo regnantibus voce vel mente supplicare, impie sentire. De Justificatione per fidem, et de sanctificatione per illam, paene similia sentiunt Catholici cum reformatis, non multum intercedit. </p>
