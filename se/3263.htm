<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3263</h4><p>3263. and now they add that on our earth our higher knowledge is like that, printed in this way, not wishing to say that on this earth higher knowledge is only written down in this way, thereby mockingly that the people here are as if dead, or only such papers, as such do they regard the interior qualities of this earth. For this reason also they shun them, because they know nothing except from papers. Thus did I follow their thoughts, while I wrote these words. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3263</h4><p>3263. that there are such things in this earth) (and they now add that in this earth their knowledges are of such a character: thus that they are as it were printed [exaratoe]. They do not wish to say that they think the knowledges of things are alone written thus in this earth; then also they laugh [mock], [saying] that men here are as it were dead, [and are] only such papers. They so consider the interiors of this earth. Wherefore they also flee from [avoid] them, because they know nothing except from papers. Thus did I follow their thoughts, when I wrote these things.) </p>
