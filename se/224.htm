<p>224.一切邪恶，以及一切意外，皆来自地狱。从刚才所述明显可知，一切邪恶，甚至意外，都是从地狱魔鬼那里爆发出来的，尽管他们对此一无所知。因为至内层天和内层天作为手段或居间物安排并管理弥赛亚神所预见并提供的事物。他们安排并管理如此预见并提供的事物，是因为这些事物有助于人类的救赎。在那些倚靠自己，沉溺于自我和尘世之爱的世人中间，这些事物立刻被转变为恶事，以及意外。因此，凡发生在人身上的恶事，甚至最小的，无不来源于地狱。我有时与内层天的魔鬼谈论这些事；有时他们会说，他们不可能做这事，因为他们对此一无所知；有时他们做得如此明显，以至于无法否认，而是坦白承认。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 224</h4><p>224. All evil, even accidental, comes from hell<p>From things that have been said, it is already clear that all evils, even accidental ones that the hellish demons are not aware of, nevertheless break forth from them. For the innermost and very inward Heaven, acting as means or intermediaries, dispose and administer those things which are foreseen and provided by God the Messiah. Now because they dispose and administer the things conducive to the salvation of the human race so foreseen and provided, therefore with people on earth who trust in themselves, these are turned immediately into evils, even accidental ones. So there is not even the very smallest evil thing that happens to a person, that does not originate from hell.<p>I have spoken several times about these matters with demons of the inward heaven, and sometimes they would say that a thing could not have happened, because they were unaware of it, and at other times they so obviously did things they could not deny, that they openly admitted having done them. 1747, the 27th day of October (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 224</h4><p>224. EVERY EVIL, ALSO EVERY ACCIDENT, COMES FROM HELL <p>From what has just been said it is evident that all evils, also accidents, burst forth from infernal genii, although they know nothing about them. For the inmost heaven and the more interior heaven as means or mediations, dispose and administer the things foreseen and provided by God Messiah; they dispose and administer the things thus foreseen and provided because they are salutary to the human race. These things, with men who trust in themselves and indulge the loves of self and the world, are immediately turned into evils, also into accidents: thus there is not even the least evil that happens to man, which does not burst forth from hell. I have sometimes spoken with the genii of the interior heaven concerning this, and at times they said they could not have done it, because they were ignorant of it; at other times they did it so openly that they could not deny, but frankly admitted it. 1747, Oct. 27, o.s. </p>
