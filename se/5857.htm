<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5857</h4><p>5857. The Mohammedans jointly with the Babylonians began to obsess my left ear and put throngs of spirits around it so they could carry out their intentions. However they did this so insensibly and unnoticeably I could scarcely feel it. But in spite of this they were immediately detected, and the Mohammedans who were forward in the west were destroyed by having the land where they were rolled back over them, and thus they were thrown down into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5857</h4><p>5857. The Mohammedans, conjointly with the Babylonians, began to obsess my left ear, and to place gangs of spirits roundabout, so that they might accomplish their aims; but they did this so insensibly and unnoticeably, that it scarcely came to the sensation. Still, however, they were instantly discovered; and the Mohammedans, who were at the front in the west, were destroyed by the earth where they were rolling over them, and were thus cast down into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5857 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5857. Mahumedani conjunctim cum Babylonicis incipiebant obsidere aurem meam sinistram, et circumcirca ponere spirituum cohortes, ut perpetrarent intentiones suas, at hoc fecerunt ita insensibiliter et inconspicue, ut vix ad sensationem perveniret, sed usque statim detecti, et Mahumedani, qui anterius in occidente, destructi per quod terra, ubi erant, revolveretur super illos, et sic in infernum dejicerentur. </p>
