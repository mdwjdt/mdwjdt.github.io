<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2827</h4><p>2827. the greatest justice would be an injustice. <sup>1</sup>Humanity deserves it, and that is their nature, therefore eternity is preached, but the intercession of the Lord or the redemption of the Lord intervenes, and He frees or exempts the soul from hell. For if it is to eternity, there is no one who is not liable for eternal damnation, because in everyone there is nothing but evil, so everyone is damned [to hell], but is taken out by the Lord.<p>This spirit who had been taken out of that black swamp is with me, and I sense that something false is clinging to him, from which he is nevertheless being freed by Divine means. For the societies of heaven have this characteristic from the Lord, that they do not want to lose anyone. For they reject no one, but he rejects himself, and his fantasy is as described. 1748, 14 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;E.g., ". . . though justice be thy plea, remember this, that in the course of justice, none of us should see salvation." (Shakespeare). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2827</h4><p>2827. the greatest justice would be injustice. Man has deserved this, and such is man, wherefore eternity is preached: but the intercession of the Lord or the redemption of the Lord intervenes and liberates or takes away from hell; for if [punished] to eternity there is no man who is not liable to eternal damnation, because in no one is there anything but mere evil: therefore everyone is damned [condemned], but is rescued by the Lord. That spirit with me has been rescued [taken] from the black lake, and I perceive that something false inheres, wherefrom he is nevertheless liberated by divine means, for the societies of heaven possess from the Lord their desire to lose no one, for they reject no one, but he rejects himself, and thus it is with his phantasy. - 1748, August 14. </p>
