<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2995</h4><p>2995. Those who desire goodness do not care at all for scientific things,<p>and almost refuse them<p>I discerned from those who were with me - they were Mohammedans-when they noticed [in me scientific] subjects of inquiry and many that would serve in confirming matters of faith in the Lord, first that they did not care for them, then that they almost spit them out with some aversion, thinking that if they receive goodness, it is enough, and that then they can learn from goodness whatever confirms, and if it is useful, innumerable things. What use could these serve for those who want to be confirmed to the contrary? 1748, 30 Aug. For such is the heavenly idea, that when one comes into goodness, one is in light as to all things that occur. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2995</h4><p>2995. THAT THEY WHO DESIRE GOOD CARE NOT AT ALL FOR SCIENTIFICS, AND, AS IT WERE, DISAPPROVE OF THEM. <p>I perceived from those with me who were Mohammedans, that when they perceived curious [facts], and many things which might serve to confirm those things which belong to faith in the Lord, that at first they did not care for them, then that they, as it were, spit them out with some aversion, thinking that if they accept good, it is sufficient, and that they can then know from good, whatever confirms, and when useful, innumerable things. What use can [these] serve them, who wish to be confirmed otherwise. - 1748, August 30; for it is enough that the heavenly idea, when in good, is in the light of all things which happen. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2995 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2995. Quod scientifica nihil curent, et quasi renuant ii, qui desiderant bonum<p>Percepi ab iis, qui apud me, erant Mahumedani, cum curiosa perciperent, et plura quae inservirent ad confirmanda ea quae sunt fidei in Dominum, primum quod non curarent, tum quod quasi respuerent cum aliqua aversatione, cogitantes, si accipiunt bonum, quod satis sit, et tunc scire possint ex bono, quicquid confirmat, et dum utile, innumerabilia; cui usui inservire possunt iis, qui volunt confirmari aliter? 1748 <sup>1</sup></p><p>, 30 Aug. Talis enim est idea coelestis, ut dum in bono, sit in luce omnium, quae occurrunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has aliter </p>
