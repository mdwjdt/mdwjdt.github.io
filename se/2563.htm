<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2563</h4><p>2563. To those who have faith in the Lord, the Lord is present and takes care of them in all things down to the very least<p>In a spiritual mental image I saw especially, and anyone can see inwardly, that those having faith in the Lord and the insight of belief, the Lord takes care of in all things down to the very least, so that they have almost no care, but without knowing it find all things that are necessary and useful to their needs. Then all things succeed with them, and they are led to heavenly happiness. The more one trusts in oneself, the farther removed one is from the Lord. So by reliance on our own wisdom, we remove ourselves from the Lord, because to that degree we remove ourselves from faith. 1748, 8 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2563</h4><p>2563. THAT TO HIM WHO HAS FAITH IN THE LORD THE LORD IS PRESENT AND LOOKS OUT [CONSULTS] FOR HIM IN EACH AND ALL THINGS. <p>Especially have I seen in spiritual idea, and anyone can perceive it, that the Lord consults in each and all things for him who has faith in the Lord and the insight of faith, almost to such an extent that he has no care whatever, but unconsciously [nescius] obtains everything that is necessary and everything that is useful to [for] necessary things. All things then succeed with him, and he is led to heavenly felicity: in so far as the man trusts in himself so much the more remote is he from the Lord; thus through reliance in his own prudence the man removes himself from the Lord, because so far [is he] from faith. - 1748, July 8. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2563 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2563. Qui fidem habet in Dominum, quod Dominus ei praesens sit, et ei in omnibus et singulis consulit<p>In idea spirituali imprimis vidi et percipere quis potest, quod qui fidem habet in Dominum, ac intuitionem fidei, quod Dominus ei in omnibus et singulis consulat, sic paene, ut non is quicquam curae habeat, sed nescius omnia nanciscatur quae necessaria, et ad necessaria utilia sunt; tunc succedunt ei omnia; et is ducitur ad felicitatem coelestem; tantum remotior est homo a Domino quantum sibi fidit, ita per confidentiam suaemet prudentiae homo se removet a Domino, quia tantum a fide. 1748, 8 Julius. </p>
