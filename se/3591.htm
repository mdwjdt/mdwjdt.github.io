<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3591</h4><p>3591. We can know nothing but what is given us by the Lord to know.<p>There were spirits who were confused by the fact that they did not know how it was that everyone possesses freedom of thought, and yet the concepts did not flow according to the order they thought they would, so they desired to inquire into the reasons, but were unable to discover them. But they were told that this happens so that they would realize that they know nothing. For if they tried to investigate all things down to the very least, then countless things would come up to confuse them, in fact, countless numbers of countless numbers, and if they learned several things, others would at once occur in opposition, and so on. It would become an eternal investigation, and contrary things would continually occur to frustrate the investigation.</p><p>[2] Therefore it is also by the Lord's Providence that one meets with so many contradictions in every detail when reasoning and drawing conclusions from the least objects. The reason they are confused by so many contradictions is so that they will abide in universal truths, or the higher knowledge of faith, so that this will rule their thoughts; and when it rules, they abstain from such pursuits. 1748, 16 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3591</h4><p>3591. THAT WE CAN KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT IS GRANTED BY THE LORD.<p>There were spirits who confused themselves from the fact that they did not know how everyone enjoyed the liberty of thinking, and that ideas did not flow according to the order which they supposed, and they wished to inquire into the causes, but were not able to discover them. It was told them that the reason of this was, that they might know that they knew nothing, for if they wished to inquire into the details of everything, there would be indefinite things which would confound, yea, indefinites of indefinites; and if they should know some of these, still there would immediately be others that were opposed to them, and so on; thus the inquiry would be protracted to eternity, and contrary things would continually confound them. Wherefore it is of the Lord's providence that one finds so many contraries in every particular about which men reason and conclude, viz, that in consequence of the confusion arising from these contraries they may abide in universal truths, or in the knowledges of faith, that these may govern their thoughts, and that while they prevail they may abstain from such [fruitless inquiries]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3591 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3591. Quod nihil scire possimus, nisi quae a Domino data<p>Erant spiritus qui se confundebant ex iis, quod non scirent quomodo cuique licentia cogitandi, ac ideae non fluerent secundum eum ordinem, quem putabant, et inquirere volebant in causas, sed non potuerunt invenire, sed dictum quod hoc factum ut scirent, quod nihil sciant, nam si in omnia et singula vellent inquirere, tunc indefinita forent quae confunderent, imo indefinitates indefinitatum, sique aliqua scirent, illico opponerentur iis alia, et sic porro, et hoc foret inquisitio in aeternum, et continue contraria confunderent: quare etiam quod Providentia Domini in singularibus tot contraria invenit, cum a singulis objectis ratiocinarentur et concluderent, causa est, quod confundantur a tot contrariis, ut maneant in veritatibus universalibus seu cognitionibus fidei, utque illae regant cogitationes, dumque regunt, abstinent a talibus. 1748, 16 Oct. </p>
