<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 781</h4><p>781. Speaking further, I said that in heaven, all since the very creation [of man] are gathered together, thus an enormous society, with whom they may become acquainted and even associate, with the resulting enjoyment and pleasantness, without any one of them desiring for whatever reason to be greater than another, but feeling themselves less. There is no comparison, therefore, between a name in heaven and a name on earth, especially among the kind of people who know nothing of what is good and heavenly, just as there is no comparison between glory in the world, and glory in heaven. Being hereby convinced, they affirmed this, because they perceived from the Lord that it was true. 1748, 15 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 781</h4><p>781. I said, moreover, that in heaven are gathered together all from the first creation, thus it is the greatest of all societies in which those who are well known can be, and with whom indeed they can hold interaction with pleasantness and delight, without anyone desiring for any reason whatever to be greater than another, but rather less in his own estimation. Thus there is no comparison between renown in heaven and renown on earth, especially among men who know nothing as to what is good and heavenly - as there is no comparison between glory in the world and glory in heaven. Being thus persuaded, they affirmed this, because they perceived from the Lord that it is so. 1748, Feb. 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 781 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>781. Praeterea loquutus sum, quod in coelo sint omnes a prima creatione congregati, sic societas maxima, quibus cogniti possunt esse, et quidem cum iis conversari, cum amaenitate et jucunditate, absque [quod] unus ex quacunque causa cupiat major esse altero, sed minor in suo sensu, sic nulla est comparatio inter nomen in coelo et nomen in terra, cumprimis inter homines tales, qui nihil sciunt quod bonum et coeleste est, sicut est nulla comparatio inter gloriam in mundo, et gloriam in coelo, ita persuasi id affirmabant, quia ex Domino percipiebant, quod ita esset 1748, 15 Febr. </p>
