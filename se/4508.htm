<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4508</h4><p>4508. Afterwards it was seen that they still trust in augur's staffs. They make staffs for themselves by fantasies, to which they ascribe power, but the staffs are completely broken up, causing them to suppose that they have lost all their power. They were also seen clinging to the hair [drawn out] lengthwise like a kind of staff, which it was not. </p>

It was afterwards seen that they still trust in staves, which they make for themselves by phantasies, in which they place power; but these staves are utterly dissipated, and they then suppose that they have lost all their power. They were also seen adhering by the pair, along the length of a kind of staff, although it was not a staff in reality. </p>

Etiam visae adhaerentes crinibus secundum longitudinem quasi cujusdam baculi, cum non erat. </p>
