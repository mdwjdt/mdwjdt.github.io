<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2289</h4><p>2289. About a portrayal of the crossing of Jordan<p>When I was reading Joshua chapter 3 about the crossing of the Jordan, many were seized with burning desire to portray to each other the crossing of the Jordan, because the land of Canaan symbolizes heaven, and so they would come into heaven. This was then granted them, and for a whole hour or more, they were portrayed crossing the Jordan, together with their families and their possessions, the ark going before them and staying in the midst of the Jordan until they had passed across.<p>These particulars were all depicted most beautifully before their eyes, and it was put in their minds at the time to suppose it was none but the reality. From time to time I sensed with what diligence and eagerness they were crossing, and how afterwards, when they had crossed over, they rejoiced at heart. They went on with this for a whole hour, or two, and meanwhile other spirits, thinking that this was all fantasy, were trying to disturb them with various tricks, but in vain. They were safe throughout and, as they declare now, they crossed over. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2289</h4><p>2289. CONCERNING A REPRESENTATION OF THE PASSAGE OF JORDAN <p>When I was reading Joshua, chap. 3 concerning the passage of Jordan, many were exceedingly desirous [ardor occupabat plures] to represent to themselves the passage of Jordan, because the land of Canaan signifies heaven, so that they might come into heaven. This also was granted them, and continued for an entire hour. It was represented that they were passing over [passed over the] Jordan with their families and whatever was theirs, as also that the ark preceded and stood in the midst of Jordan until they had passed over; all this was represented very beautifully before their eyes, and the thought [mens] was then inserted in them to think this a reality [quod non aliter autumarent], when I perceived with what diligence and earnestness they passed over, as well as that presently when they had crossed over, they heartily rejoiced. They kept up this for an entire hour or two; and meanwhile other spirits, who supposed this [mere] phantasies, desired to disturb them by various machinations, but in vain: they were constantly secure and passed over, as they now say. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2289 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2289. De repraesentatione transitus Jordanis<p>Cum legerem Josuam C. III de transitu Jordanis, ardor occupabat plures, repraesentare sibi transitum Jordanis, quia terra Canaan significat coelum, ut sic venirent in coelum, quod etiam iis concessum erat, et per integram horam, quod excurrit, repraesentabatur quod transirent Jordanem, cum familiis suis, et quae eorum erant, tum quod arca praeiret, et staret in medio Jordane, usque dum transiissent, haec omnia coram oculis eorum perpulchre repraesentata sunt, et iis tunc indita mens, quod non aliter autumarent, quandoque percepi, qua industria et aviditate transirent, tum quod postmodum, cum transivissent, ex corde laetarentur: hoc per integram horam, vel binas continuabant, ac interea alii spiritus, qui hoc phantasias esse [erant] cogitantes <sup>1</sup></p><p>, eos variis machinationibus volebant disturbare, sed incassum. Semper in tuto erant, et ut dicunt nunc transiebant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;vide praefationem hujus editionis sub capite "Idiosyncrasies" </p>
