<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4181</h4><p>4181. Concerning dwellings<p>Certain acquaintances, my maternal ancestors, related to me that they had tidy dwellings where they stayed, which could not be shown to me, lest alien spirits conceive a mental image of them. They said they were given to them, and that they changed from time to time, and that they were continually busy. They wanted to describe them, but could not for the reason given - only that there were such dwellings that were continually given to them, and that they delighted in them. 1749, 26 March. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4181</h4><p>4181. CONCERNING DOMICILES.<p>Certain acquaintances of mine, maternal ancestors, related to me that they had neat domiciles or habitations where they abode, but which could not be shown to me lest other spirits should get an idea of them. They said that they were given to them, and that they were changed [from time to time], and that they continued there in various employments. They wished to describe them to me, but could not for the reason above mentioned, save that they were such; that they were given to them continually; and that they dwelt there with delight. - 1749, March 26. </p>

De domiciliis<p>Narrabant mihi noti, matres meae, quod domicilia haberent munda, ubi essent, quae mihi ostendi non potuerunt, ne spiritus alii ideam eorum caperent, dicebant illa iis dari, et mutari, et ibi continue in officiis esse; describere volebant, sed non potuerunt ex causa de qua, solum quod talia essent, et iis darentur continue, et ibi delectari. 1749, 26 Martius. </p>
