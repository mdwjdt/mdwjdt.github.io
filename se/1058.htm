<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1058</h4><p>1058. In the human body and its internal organs, especially in the cerebrum and cerebellum, as well as in both medullas, likewise in the liver, and kidneys, spiritual qualities are depicted by their striated, almost marrowy bodies, especially those which are white. Coarser spiritual qualities are depicted by the more visible ducts, so connected and situated that they still relate to the striate body, thus by all ducts in which any liquid is secreted, except the blood vessels. Such striped bodies are therefore also white; and if very finely striped, they are transparent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1058</h4><p>1058. In the human body and its viscera, especially in the cerebrum and cerebellum, also in both medullary substances, likewise in the liver and kidneys, spiritual things are represented by the bodies that are striated, as it were, medullary; these especially are white. The grosser spiritual things are also represented by the more visible ducts so conjoined and situated as still to relate to a striated body; thus they are represented by all the ducts in which any liquid is secreted, except the sanguineous ducts. Such striated bodies therefore are also white, and if they are most delicately striated they are transparent. </p>

In corpore humano, et ejus visceribus, cumprimis in cerebro et cerebello, tum utraque medulla, similiter in Hepate, renibus, repraesentantur spiritualia per corpora eorum striata, quasi medullaria, quae imprimis sunt alba, tum crasse spiritualia, per ductus visibiliores ita conjunctos et positos, ut striatum corpus usque referant, ita per omnes ductus, praeter sanguineos, in quibus aliquod liquidum secretum est, talia corpora striata ideo quoque sunt alba, sique tenuissime <sup>1</sup></p><p>striata, sunt pellucentia.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has tenuissimi </p>
