<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3239</h4><p>3239. The inner sense is such that it delights only in higher knowledge of things, but nothing beyond this, for which reason also when still more inward things are concerned, which regard uses, they do not care for them, consequently not for knowledge of purposes, or of the one final purpose. It is on account of this that they are proud, and because they are, the life of purposes and uses cannot so readily stream into them before this pride is taken away from them.<p>This is the pride that had caused most of the behavior as described [1415-1435, 1441-1459, 3233 ff.]. For they had despised others in comparison with themselves. Now those who are humbled have confessed, weeping somewhat, that the Lord is their Only Lord. They then admitted that to them it was a matter of mere knowing, whereupon they were given to know it also with understanding. For they do not worship any other [Lord], yet because they esteem themselves above others, they do not care. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3239</h4><p>3239. ([Their] internal sense is such, that it delights only in the knowledges of things, and nothing beyond. Wherefore, also since there are interiors, which pertain to uses, they do not care [so much] for these; consequently not for ends, thus for the only end: hence also it comes that they are proud, and because proud [in fastu], therefore, the life of ends and uses cannot inflow into them, before that pride is taken away from them. This pride it is which has done most of those things which I have described; for they despised others in comparison with themselves. They who are in a state of humiliation have now acknowledged, with some weeping, that the Lord alone is their Lord; they then acknowledged that what they know scientifically, it is also given them to know intellectually: for they do not worship another [Lord]; but inasmuch as they esteem themselves above others, they do not care.) </p>

Sensus internus est talis ut modo delectetur cognitionibus rerum, nec ulterius quid, quare etiam cum interiora adhuc, quae sunt usuum, non ita iis curae sunt, proinde non finium, ita unici finis, inde quoque est quod fastu sint, et quia fastu sunt, non ita <sup>1</sup></p><p>vita finium et usuum in eos influere potest, antequam fastus is iis adimatur, hic fastus est, qui fecerat plurima, de quibus in descriptione, nam contempserant alios prae semet: nunc fassi qui in humiliatione, cum quodam fletu, quod Dominus sit Solus eorum Dominus: fassi sunt dein, quod scientifice, tum datum iis quoque quod intellectualiter illud sciant; non enim colunt alium, sed quia se aestimant prae aliis, non curant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ita ita 702 </p>
