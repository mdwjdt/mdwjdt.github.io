<p>346.穆罕默德还说，他只知道自己活在人世间。在来世，所有人的状态是这样：即便他们得知明确的事实，如他们并非活在肉身中，然而过后立刻就忘了；因为出于某些必要的原因，他们没有被赋予关于这类事的记忆。他周围的灵人也说，他们以为自己活在人世间。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 346</h4><p>346. Mohammed also said that he knew no otherwise than that he was living on earth. For the condition of all in the other life is such that even though they are informed about specific facts, as that they are not living in the body, yet immediately afterwards, they forget it; for they are not gifted with a memory of things of this kind, for reasons of necessity. Also the spirits around him said they believed they were living on earth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 346</h4><p>346. Mahomed also said that he knew no otherwise than that he was living on the earth; for such is the condition of all in the other life, that although they are instructed concerning particular things, as that they are not living in the body, still immediately afterwards they forget it, for they are not gifted with a memory of such things, for necessary reasons. The spirits around him also said that they supposed that they were living on earth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 346 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>346. Dixit etiam Mahumed, quod non aliud sciret, quam quod viveret in terra, nam talis est omnium conditio in altera vita, ut tametsi instruuntur de rebus particularibus, sicut quod non vivant in corpore, usque illico post id obliviscantur, nam iis nulla datur memoria similium rerum, ob causas necessarias: spiritus qui circum eum, etiam dicebant quod autumarent se vivere in terra. </p>
