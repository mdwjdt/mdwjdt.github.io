<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>484.不过，尽管一个灵人具有这种性质，即：他能与其他灵人协调一致，如与恶灵；然而，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，他们从其团体中被带走，插到其他人的团体当中，好叫他们能进入蒙福者的团体。弥赛亚神也将他们联结起来，好叫他们能一起生活。因此，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，他们从一个圈子被转到另一个圈子；这些圈子如何，他们的生活就如何。这一点对我来说，是最明显不过的，因为我不断从一个团体被带到另一个团体，并进入各个团体的生活。不过，我的情况有所不同，因为我被赋予双重思维，一种是更内在的，而另一种是内在的；因此，当我与恶灵在一起时，仍能同时与善灵同在，从而能看出试图引导我的灵人是何性质，而且这种事通常是在我有意识的情况下发生的。没有这种意识，即：我与恶灵同在，并且正是这些灵人如此思想，并影响我，我必以为我自己就是这种人，是我自己在沉思这些事。（1748年1月17日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 484</h4><p>484. But even though a spirit may be of a kind to harmonize with other spirits, such as with evil spirits, nevertheless, by the mercy of God the Messiah, these kinds are delivered from their company and inserted into a group of others, so that they may come into the company of the blessed. God the Messiah as it were unites them, so that they may live together.<p>Thus by the mercy of God the Messiah, they are transferred from one circle to another, and such as the circles are, such is their life. This should be very evident to me, since I have been led from one group to another, continuously, and have come into the life of each one. But in my case - since I have been gifted with a double thought, one more inward, the other inward - when I was in the company of evil spirits, I could still at the same time be in the company of good ones, and thus see what the spirits were like who were trying to lead me, and this almost always happened with awareness on my part. Without this realization that I am in the company of evil spirits, and that it is these spirits who are so thinking and making me feel, I could not but believe that I myself were such a person, and meditated such things. 1748, the 17th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 484</h4><p>484. But still, although a spirit is such that he may be conformable with other spirits, as with the evil, of the mercy of God Messiah, they are taken away from their company, and inserted amongst others, so that thus they may come into the company of the blessed. God Messiah also unites them, so that they can be together: thus from the mercy of God Messiah, they are transferred from certain consociations to others and such as are the consociations, such is their life. This ought to be most manifest to me, for I was led continually from one consociation to another, and acquired the life of the consociation; but with a difference [in my case], because I am gifted with a twofold thought, one more interior and the other interior, so that when I was in the company of evil spirits, I could at the same time be in the company of the good, and could thus perceive the quality of the spirits who desired to lead me, and this most frequently, with awareness. Without such awareness, namely, that I am in the company of evil spirits, and that the spirits are they who thus think and affect me, I could not have known otherwise than that it was I who am such, and who meditated such things. 1748, Jan. 17. </p>
