<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4220</h4><p>4220. About auras<p>I saw a certain one dressed in garments decorated with gold, and the thought came to me that on account of his garments he was constantly thinking of himself, his reputation and self respect, even when he is thinking of something else that has drawn [his attention], and one who is prone to this thinking, acquires it as a habit that recurs whenever he is so dressed and confronts other people; hence comes that aura of self repute and love of self. The same applies to all other things people identify with themselves, of which there are more than can be recounted. Even when one conceives a mental picture of matters of faith, that picture remains and becomes familiar, and whenever something to do with faith comes up, it is in the same general mental picture or aura.</p><p>[2] These auras are what are clearly perceived in the other life upon [a spirit's] first arrival, for he arouses in me such things as are in agreement with himself, and then discord is perceived. Auras of this kind are usually turned into auras of odor, whence putrid and excremental ones manifest their qualities. They are also apt to turn into visual auras, and when they appear as auras of formality, then they are revolting as such. So it is with polite manners. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4220</h4><p>4220. CONCERNING SPHERES.<p>On seeing a certain person clothed in garments decorated with gold, I conceived that from the pride of his apparel he was continually thinking of himself, of his own honor and repute, even while other things were on his mind, and that too from his thoughts being attracted in that direction. Whoever yields to that attraction induces by degrees a habit, and such a train of thought rules with him as often as he is thus showily dressed, or sees other people, and from hence is acquired a sphere of self-honor or self-love. The case is the same in regard to everything by which a man allows himself to be attracted, which are more numerous than can be recited; so that even while he exercises his thoughts respecting the things of faith, that leading idea still remains with him, and becomes so familiar that as often as anything occurs respecting faith, the man is still in the same general idea or sphere. Such spheres are among those which are most manifestly perceived in the other life, even upon one's first entrance thither, for they excite with others, as they did with me, whatever is accordant with them, thus disclosing at the same time whatever is discordant. Spheres of this kind are wont also to be turned into spheres of odors, which from their quality are fetid and disgusting, to the last degree. They are also sometimes converted into visible spheres, when they appear of spherical form, and from their essential properties are horribly revolting, as is the case even with [the sphere of] civilities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4220 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4220. De sphaeris<p>Vidi quendam vestibus auratis vestitum, et concepi ideam, quod is ex vestibus suis cogitet jugiter de se, suo honore et respectu, etiam dum aliud cogitat, quod attraxit, et qui attrahit tale, habitum induit, et regnat talis cogitatio quoties ita vestitus est, et videt alios: inde sphaera illa honoris sui, seu amoris sui: similiter se habet cum omnibus aliis, quae homo sibi attrahit, quorum plura sunt quam quae possunt dici; etiam dum concepit ideam de illis quae sunt fidei, remanet illa idea, et fit familiaris, ut quoties occurrat aliquid de fide, in simili idea communi seu sphaera sit. Tales sphaerae sunt quae percipiuntur manifeste in altera vita, ad primum adventum, nam [is] excitat apud me talia quae ei concordant, et sic discordantia percipitur: tales sphaerae solent verti in odoris sphaeras, unde putida et excrementitia, [manifestantes] quales sunt: etiam verti solent in visuales, cum apparent sicut formae sphaerae tunc sunt abominabiles cum tales. Ita civilitates. </p>
