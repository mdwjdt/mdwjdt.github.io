<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2851</h4><p>2851.<p>From this I was able to learn how evil spirits, each according to their own state of mind and their own nature, extracted from the mental images of my memory everything whatever in the scope of that composite mental image that was agreeable to them. Some took remote elements, in fact, very remote, which were far to the side of the image, brought there from some object of thought, of hearing, or of sight. For the mental images of the memory are such that very many elements can be associated to them one after another, and indeed, even alien elements, and the mental images are like a field of many subjects put together and thus associated from objects of the senses and of the thinking.

Some [took] remote, some, more remote things, which were far to the side of the idea; also from every object of thought, hearing, or sight, were brought [such things] thither [to them]. For it is thus with the ideas of memory, that very many things, and even dissimilars [aliena] may be successively associated; and ideas, like a field of many things, are compounded from objects of the senses and thought, thus are associated; they are, as it were, companionships of very many things, and in whatever manner the simpler ideas are consociated and associated, and whatever their quality, such is man, as regards that idea, and when men after the death of the body are amongst such spirits, </p>
