<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>344.关于穆罕默德。有一个似乎独立的天堂被展示出来，穆罕默德的敬拜者就住在那里；不过，住在那里的，并不是天使，只是一些灵人。当这些灵人听见这个天堂（基督徒的天堂）所说的话时，便请求他们也能上去说话。他们一来就说得如此巧妙、谨慎，而且具有如此讨人喜欢的机敏，以致基督徒天堂的灵人感到羞愧。那时，交流也打开了，好叫他们能一起交谈。当被问及穆罕默德时，他们回答说，他们承认穆罕默德，不知道别的；但他们只想敬拜独一的神，天地的造物主。那时，穆罕默德以那个天堂的波浪状运动（因为他们有许多人）回答他们说，他凭自己什么也做不了，甚至不能说话；相反，他发觉他凭自己没有任何能力，只有一位独一无二的神。他在灵人面前见证了这一点，所以他从那里被提上去，敬拜至高神；毫无疑问，这至高神就是弥赛亚神。（1747年12月14日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 344</h4><p>344. About Mohammed<p>A seemingly separate heaven was displayed, where the worshippers of Mohammed were, but there were only spirits there, not angels. Those spirits, when they heard what was being said in this heaven, <sup>1</sup>requested that they too might come up and speak. When they came, they spoke so sensibly and prudently, and also with such pleasing ingenuity, that the spirits of the Christians' heaven felt ashamed. Then communication was also opened up, so that they could speak together, and being questioned about Mohammed, they replied that they acknowledged Mohammed, not knowing any better, but that they only wanted to worship the One God creator of heaven and earth.<p>Then Mohammed, with the wave-like gesture of that heaven, for there were many of them, answered them, saying that he could do nothing from himself, not even speak, but that he realized he had no power from himself, and that there was only one single [God]. This he testified before the spirits, and so he was raised up from there, and he worshipped the Most High God - none other than God the Messiah. 1747, 14 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. the heaven of Christians. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 344</h4><p>344. CONCERNING MAHOMED <p>There was represented, as it were, a distinct heaven where the worshippers of Mahomed were - but only spirits were there - not angels. When those spirits heard what was being said in that heaven, they requested that they also might ascend and speak; and having come, they spoke so skillfully and prudently, and with such pleasant adroitness, that the spirits of the heaven of Christians were affected with shame. Communication also was then opened so that they might talk together. When asked about Mahomed, they replied that they had acknowledged Mahomed, not knowing differently, but that they wanted to adore only the one God, the Creator of heaven and earth. Then also Mahomed, with the as it were undulatory motion of that heaven, for there were many, replied to them, that he could do nothing of himself, not even speak, but that he perceived that he had no power of himself and was only a single individual; this he testified before the spirits. So he was raised up thence, and adored the Supreme God, undoubtedly, God Messiah. 1747, Dec. 14. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 344 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>344. De Mahumede<p>Erat repraesentatum quasi distinctum coelum, ubi cultores Mahumedis essent, sed ibi erant solum spiritus, non autem angeli, spiritus isti, cum audirent quid in hoc coelo diceretur, petierunt, ut etiam ascenderent, ac loquerentur, qui dum venirent <sup>1</sup></p><p>, tam scite et prudenter, tum etiam cum solertia amaena loquuti sunt, ut spiritus coeli Christianorum pudore afficerentur, tunc etiam aperta est communicatio, ut simul loqui possent, ac interrogati de Mahumede, ac respondebant quod agnoverint Mahumedem, aliter non scientes, sed quod solum adorare vellent Unum Deum creatorem coeli et terrae; tunc etiam Mahumed cum coeli istius motu quasi undulante, quia multi erant, iis respondebat, quod nihil ex se posset, ne quidem loqui, sed quod perciperet, quod nihil potentiae ex se haberet, et modo esset unicus, quod testatus est coram spiritibus, ita sublatus est inde, et adoravit Supremum Deum, nimirum Deum Messiam. 1747, 14 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has venerent </p>
