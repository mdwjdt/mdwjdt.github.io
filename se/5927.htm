<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5927</h4><p>5927. About the Lord<p>I spoke with the angels about the Lord, [about the misapprehension] that His Divine was from eternity, for the Church's doctrine drawn from the Word teaches that He was born from the Father from eternity. From this it would follow, however, that He was not conceived from the Father but that He was conceived from His own Divine, and in this case He could not have been called God's Son but His own Son. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5927</h4><p>5927. THE LORD. <p>I conversed with angels about the Lord, saying, that His Divine was from eternity, for the doctrine of the Church from the Word teaches, that He was born of the Father from eternity. Hence it might follow that He was not conceived by the Father, but that He was conceived by His own Divine, and thus could not be termed, in the world, the Son of God, but His own Son. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5927 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5927. De Domino<p>Loquutus sum cum angelis de Domino, quod Divinum Ipsi fuerit ab aeterno, nam doctrina Ecclesiae ex Verbo docet, quod natus sit a Patre ab aeterno, inde sequeretur quod non conceptus fuerit a Patre, sed quod conceptus a suo Divino, et sic non in mundo dici potuerit Filius Dei, sed Filius suus. </p>
