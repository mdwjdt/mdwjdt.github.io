<p>382.弥赛亚神的话渗透到众天堂和内层，事实上渗透到灵人和天使的至内在部分。当弥赛亚神的圣言被阅读时，它就照各人的状态渗透到各人里面。因此，对那些处于肉体的人来说，它几乎渗透不到更深处，仅止于肉体感官；而对死人的灵魂、灵人和天使来说，它渗透到各人的至内在部分。如我根据天上的人对我说的话所推断的，若弥赛亚神乐意，仅仅通过世人阅读或念诵圣言，它就抵达天上每个人那里，在他身上产生其效果。这种效果，事实上这种渗透的确存在；我从我所说过读过的东西很肯定地知道这一点；事实上，有几次，它们抵达我周围大量的人那里，具有各种不同的功效，并渗透到他们的至内在部分。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 382</h4><p>382. The words of God the Messiah penetrate to the heavens, and to the inward, in fact innermost parts of spirits and angels<p>When the Word of God the Messiah is read, it enters within people according to their own state. So with those who are in the body, it hardly enters more deeply than the bodily senses, whereas in souls of the dead, spirits and angels, it penetrates to each one's innermost parts. And as I can infer from what I was told by heavenly beings, just by the mere reading or reciting [of the Word] by a person on earth, it reaches and has its effect on anyone God the Messiah wishes in the heavens.<p>This kind of effect and indeed, penetration, does exist; I know for certain from things that have been said, and read, by me, and in fact, several times: namely, that they reached a large number, with varying degrees of effectiveness, and penetrated to their innermost parts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 382</h4><p>382. THAT THE WORDS OF GOD MESSIAH PENETRATE TO THE HEAVENS AND TO THE INTERIORS, AND EVEN TO THE INMOST THINGS OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS <p>When the Word of God Messiah is read it penetrates into each one according to his state: thus with those who are in the body, it scarcely penetrates within the senses of the body; but with the souls of the dead, with spirits and angels, it penetrates into the inmosts of each one: and, as I can conclude from the sayings of the heavenly ones, also from man's reading only, or from his conversation, it thus penetrates with effect to every one in the heavens [if] it is well-pleasing to God Messiah. That there is such an effect and even insinuation into heaven, I know for certain from the things which have been stated by me, and read; and sometimes, indeed, that they have reached to a great number [of those around me] with varying efficacy, and have penetrated to their inmosts. </p>
