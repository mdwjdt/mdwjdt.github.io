<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4051</h4><p>4051. Those having a life of such conviction are purged differently than those having a life of the will or passions. A life of conviction is purged in such a way that the subjects are reduced to a state of complete ignorance, so as to know nothing, then to one of confusion, so that when they think about these matters, it is almost like torture. So there are different kinds of inward pains that torture them when they are returning to their life of conviction, which tortures vary according to the faith of which they have convinced themselves, or which they have confirmed. It was also shown how confused they become, not knowing what they are saying, then finally, they are able to return into a life of true faith. Thus they are purged differently who have a life of conviction of faith than those who have a life of passions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4051</h4><p>4051. Those who are in the life of such a persuasion, are vastated otherwise than those who are in the life of the will or of cupidities. The life of persuasion is so vastated that the subject of it may be reduced to complete ignorance, so that he shall know nothing; then that he shall be brought into such a state of [mental] confusion that while he thinks upon these matters he shall be so confounded that it shall almost amount to torture, as there are various kinds of internal anguish that torment one while he is returning into the life of his persuasion, which tortures are diversified according to the faith in which he had persuaded himself, or which he had confirmed. It was shown also to what degree they become confused, viz. that they know not what they say; thus they are enabled at length to return into the life of true faith; so differently vastated are they who are in the life of the persuasion of faith from those who are in the life of cupidities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4051 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4051. Qui in persuasionis talis vita, vastantur aliter quam qui in vita voluntatis seu cupiditatum; persuasionis vita vastatur ita, quod redigatur in ignorantiam plenariam, ut nihil sciat; tum in confusum, ut dum cogitat de istis confundatur ita, ut fere crucietur, ita sunt varii dolores intus, qui cruciant, dum in persuasionis suae vitam redit, qui cruciatus diversi sint, secundum fidem, de qua sibi persuasit, seu quam confirmavit. Ostensum quoque quam confusi fiunt, nihil sciunt quid loquuntur, sic demum redire possunt in vitam verae fidei, sic aliter vastantur vita persuasionis fidei, quam vita cupiditatum. </p>
