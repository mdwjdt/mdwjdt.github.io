<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5288</h4><p>5288. I spoke with Jesuits who went in and out. They understood how it was all over for the cities spoken of earlier. So they went down into their cells and hid away their more precious things there in crypts that are still darker, where they believed they could not be taken away but safely kept for use at a later time. They have the greatest concern for their riches. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5288</h4><p>5288. I spoke with the Jesuits who went out and in. They were aware of how it had fared with the cities already mentioned; wherefore, they descended to the cellars, and there they hide their more precious things in crypts there that are still darker, so that they may serve their purposes afterwards; for they believe that they cannot be taken away from these hiding-places. They have the greatest anxiety over their riches. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5288 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5288. Loquutus sum cum Jesuitis qui egressi et intrarunt, sciverunt quomodo actum cum urbibus de quibus prius, quare descendebant in cellas, ac ibi pretiosiora sua recondunt in cryptis ibi adhuc obscurioribus, ubi credunt non posse tolli, ut reserventur usibus eorum postea, maximam curam suarum divitiarum habent. </p>
