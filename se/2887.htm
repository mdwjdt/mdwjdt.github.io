<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2887</h4><p>2887. About someone who thought it absurd that spirits are elsewhere than in the place where they appear<p>A certain spirit wanted to pour into others [his view] that it was absurd to say that a spirit was elsewhere than near me, where he appeared, but I was prompted to reply to him, how can it happen that he, who is buried at a distance of a thousand miles away from me, is nevertheless with me in the same place I am, even when I might be in some country or other, and he is certainly not removed from his place to wherever I am? To this he could make no reply. 1748, 22 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2887</h4><p>2887. CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO SUPPOSED IT TO BE ABSURD THAT SPIRITS ARE ELSEWHERE THAN IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY APPEAR. <p>A certain spirit wished to infuse in others that it was absurd to say that a spirit was elsewhere than near me, where he appears; but it was granted to reply to him, how it can happen, to wit: that he who is buried a thousand miles distance from me, and still is with me in the same place, is not certainly then removed from his place, thence to where I am, when I might be in one or other kingdom. Whereto he could reply nothing. - 1748, August 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2887 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2887. De quodam qui putabat absurdum esse quod spiritus alibi sint, quam in loco ubi apparent<p>Quidam spiritus infundere aliis volebat, quod absurdum esset dicere, quod spiritus alibi esset, quam prope me ubi apparet, sed respondere ei datum, quomodo fieri potest, quod is qui {a} forte mille milliaribus distantia a me sepultus est, et usque penes me sit, in eodem loco, tam cum essem in uno ac altero regno, nec quidem inde a loco suo removetur, ubicunque sum? ad quod nihil respondere potuit. 1748, 22 Aug. </p>
