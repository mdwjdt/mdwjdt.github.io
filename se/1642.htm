<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1642</h4><p>1642. To him who is such as not to ascribe any merit to himself all things are given, but to those who arrogate it to themselves, nothing is given<p>I was speaking with spirits about the fact that nothing whatever should be taken away or stolen from anyone, not even the least thing; and that in this way, the trustworthy receive much as a gift. The same principle applies in the case of spirits who ascribe any merit to themselves, and consequently try to claim to themselves what is the Lord's. To such a one, nothing is given, nor is anything given to any who try to abstain from taking credit or ascribing merit to themselves so that they may obtain much, or everything, as this savors of cunning. Those, however, who have faith, the believers, are unable to take away anything, because they are led by the Lord. Therefore they cannot; and so it is they who obtain many things, and, in fact, everything they might ever desire. 1748, 22 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1642</h4><p>1642. THAT TO ONE WHO IS OF SUCH A QUALITY THAT HE ATTRIBUTES NO MERIT TO HIMSELF, ALL THINGS ARE GRANTED; BUT THAT TO THOSE WHO ARROGATE [MERIT] TO THEMSELVES, NOTHING IS GIVEN. <p>I spoke with spirits to the effect that nothing whatever, even of the most trifling nature, ought to be abstracted or stolen from another, and that thus the faithful, by reason of their fidelity, are made the recipients of many favors. Similar is the case with spirits; if anyone ascribes merit to himself, and in that way would fain lay claim to those things which are of the Lord only, to him nothing is granted for this very reason; neither to him who abstains from pilfering from others or attributing merit to himself, with a view to obtaining much or all, as this savors of cunning. But those who are in faith, or the faithful, cannot take away from others or arrogate to themselves, because they are led by the Lord, and thus are incapable of such conduct. Consequently they are the ones who obtain much, and in fact all that they can ever desire. - 1748, March 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1642 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1642. Quod qui talis est, ut non sibi aliquid meriti tribuat, omnia dentur illi, qui vero sibi arrogent, iis nihil detur<p>Cum spiritibus loquutus de eo, quod nihil quicquam alicui adimere seu furari debeant, si vel minimum esset, et quod sic quia fideles, dono accipiant multa; similis se res habet apud spiritus, qui aliquid sibi tribuit meriti, et ideo sibi vindicare [vult] <sup>1</sup></p><p>ea, quae Domini sunt, ei nihil datur, quia talis est, nec ei, qui nihil auferre seu sibi tribuere velit, ex causa ut multa seu omnia obtineat, quod sapit astutiam, at vero qui in fide sunt, seu fideles, non possunt quicquam auferre, aut sibi vindicare, quia a Domino ducuntur, ideo non possunt, quare ii sunt, qui multa, et quidem omnia quae usquam desiderann, obtinent. 1748, 22 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
