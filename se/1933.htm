<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1933</h4><p>1933. There was a certain person with me today, whom I did not know, and who seemed to have deceased not long ago. When I was allowed to inquire where he came from, he was led through cities which he did not know, saying it was not there. But when he was led through his own city, then he recognized the streets, and everything, and if I had known how the houses were situated, I could also have found the house where he had lived. But this was not allowed. 1748, 10 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1933</h4><p>1933. A certain one, whom I had not previously known, and who seemed to have but recently died, was with me today; and when it was permitted to inquire whence he was, he was led [by my memory] through various unknown cities, of which he said it was not there; but when he was conducted through his own city, then he recognized the streets, and everything connected; and if I had known the situation of the houses, I could also have found the house where he had lived; but this was not permitted. - 1748, May 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1933 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1933. Quidam hodie apud me, quem non cognoscebam, qui non ita pridem discessisse videtur, cum inquirere liceret undenam esset, ducebatur per urbes, quas non cognoscebat, dicens quod ibi non esset, at dum per ejus urbem, tunc cognoscebat plateas, et omnia, sique novissem domus, quomodo sitae, potuissem quoque domum, ubi habitaverat, invenire, sed hoc non licuit. 1748, 10 Maj. </p>
