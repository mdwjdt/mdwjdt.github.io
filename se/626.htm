<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 626</h4><p>626. I was able to observe their presence [with me] when they themselves did not, by a widening of my mouth, or the region of the lips and cheeks, for they have this effect [<a href="569.htm">569</a>]. And as they then think I am like they are, that region of my face was disposed into that shape as a result of their imaginative power.<p>And so it is evident that the angels of the inward heaven <sup>1</sup>are separate because of their earthly-minded characters, as said previously, while the angels of the very inward and innermost heaven are together throughout the universe [<a href="552.htm">552</a>]; for no discordance can exist among those who are truly spiritual and heavenly, but only among the earthly-minded. 1748, 2 February.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262, footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 626</h4><p>626. I could observe their presence when they themselves did not observe it by the dilatation of my mouth or of the region of the lips and cheeks, for they are such; and since they suppose that I also am like them, and also from their imagination am in such a form, that region of my face was moved out of shape. It is evident therefore that the angels of the interior heaven are distinct according to their natural dispositions, as was said; but the angels of the more interior, and of the inmost heavens are together throughout the universe, for there can be no discrepancy between those who are truly spiritual and celestial, but only between those who are natural. 1748, Feb. 2. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 626 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>626. Praesentiam eorum observare potui, quando non id ii observarunt, per dilationem oris seu regionis labiorum ac genarum, nam tales sunt, quumque putant me quoque similem esse, tunc <sup>1</sup></p><p>ex eorum imaginatione in talem formam, regio ista faciei meae disposita fuit.<p>Constat itaque quod angeli interioris coeli distincti sint, secundum naturales eorum indoles, ut dictum, sed angeli intimioris ac intimi coeli sunt simul, in universo, nam nulla dari potest discrepantia vere spiritualium et coelestium, sed modo naturalium. 1748, 2 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition tum </p>
