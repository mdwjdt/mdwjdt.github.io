<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3155</h4><p>3155. How it is that a spirit seems to lose what is his own<p>A certain spirit who was shown in various ways that he seems to live, and indeed seems to seem to live, was confused, thinking there was nothing at all of him that lived. So he was shown in various ways that he supposed he sees with his eyes, supposed his hands touch [things], so he seems to himself to have eyes, and to have hands.<p>He was further told that the same is the case with everything else as with the outer senses, which he seems to himself to enjoy [the use of] as when he was a person on earth. It is likewise the case with his thought, which he supposed at that time to be his alone. As it had been shown him before that he thought from others [<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>], the society from which or with which he was thinking was removed from him, and then his inward parts seemed to be thinking, and in fact, in a more innocent way.<p>The thinking that had been taken away was placed on my head, so that he could get it back from there. This shows that it was only the society, and its look, that made the thinking and that matter which was put on my head, and that what remained by which he was living was a purer society. It is similar in the case of calluses that are removed [<a href="807.htm">807</a>, <a href="862.htm">862-865</a>, <a href="951.htm">951-952</a>, <a href="958.htm">958</a>, <a href="963.htm">963-966</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023-1029</a>, <a href="2467.htm">2467-2469</a>]. 1748, 14 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3155</h4><p>3155. HOW IT HAPPENS [se habet] THAT A SPIRIT SEEMS TO BE PERSUADED [persuaderi, I think] THAT ANYTHING IS OF HIMSELF [suum]. <p>A certain spirit to whom it was shown in various ways that he seems to live, yea, seems to seem to see, was thereby confused, and thought that thus there was nothing of him that lived: wherefore it was shown him in various ways that he thought he saw with his eyes, thought he touched with the hand: therefore that he seemed to himself to have eyes, and have hands. It was further told them that it is so with everything else [coeteris], just as with the external senses, which he seems to himself to enjoy like as when he was a man. It was equally the case with his thought, which he then supposed to be his alone, [and] this, when it was previously shown that he thought from others. Then the society from or with which he thought, was taken away from him: then his interiors seemed to think, yea in a more innocent manner. The thought which was removed was placed over my head, that he might there receive it. Hence it may be evident that it was only the society and its intuition which caused thought, and that force which was placed above the head: and that the rest [remainder] by which he lives was a purer society. It is just as when callosities [callis] are removed. - 1748, September 14. </p>
