<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5295</h4><p>5295. Certain ones who had been devoted entirely to wealth descended to their treasures, determined to die there themselves, saying that if their treasures were lost, it would be all over for them too. However, in the end they were thrown out, all of them carrying their gold idols with them. But they were forced to throw them away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5295</h4><p>5295. Some, also, who were wholly devoted to wealth, let themselves down, from their heart's desire, to their treasures, and resolved to die there, saying, that, if their treasures are destroyed, it is all over with them also. These, at the last, however, were cast out, all of them carrying their golden images along with them; but they were compelled to cast them away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5295 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5295. Quidam etiam qui dediti fuerunt prorsus divitiis, se demiserunt ad gazas, et obstinaverunt se mori ibi, dicentes, quod si pereant gazae, etiam actum sit cum illis, sed illi usque ultimo ejecti sunt, portantes aurea idola secum quilibet, sed coacti sunt a se ejicere. </p>
