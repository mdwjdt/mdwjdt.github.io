<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1424</h4><p>1424. I was also given to realize that their life on their planet is such that they have no care for earthly and bodily concerns, but for things beyond them, such as what is in heaven. So they speak with spirits, who teach them about what is in heaven, and they enjoy higher knowledge of spiritual matters. Therefore, when they were drawing out several items from my memory, they said that it was so [<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>], and thus affirmed the matter, not knowing that I am in the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1424</h4><p>1424. I was also given to perceive that such is their life on their own earth that they care nothing about earthly and corporeal things, but about things which are outside of themselves, such as those which are in heaven. Thus they speak with spirits who instruct them concerning the things that are in heaven, and they are thereby delighted with the cognitions of spiritual things. Therefore, also, when they called forth many things from my memory, they said and affirmed that it is of such a nature, not knowing that I am in the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1424 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1424. Percipere etiam mihi dabatur, quod talis eorum vita in tellure eorum sit, ut nihil curent terrestria et corporea, sed quod ea quae extra eos sunt, sicut quae in coelo, sic ut loquantur cum spiritibus, et [hi] instruunt eos, de iis, quae sunt in coelo, sic quod spiritualium cognitionibus delectentur, quare etiam cum ex memoria mea excitabant plura, dicebant, quod tale sit, et sic affirmabant, non scientes, quod in corpore sim. </p>
