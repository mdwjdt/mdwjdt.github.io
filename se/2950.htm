<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2950</h4><p>2950. About mankind's Fall<p>By a spiritual mental image it was granted to me and other spirits and angels who were with me to see how humanity fell, namely that the most ancient Church had been in a state of faith and consequently in company with spirits and angels, and people were just as united as if they were in heaven-like those best ones on another planet, spoken of [earlier, 539 ff.] - but that they fell away, so that the contemplation of inward things withdrew from humanity, until today they are [living] only in superficialities. 1748, 27 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2950</h4><p>2950. CONCERNING THE FALL OF MAN. <p>It was granted me, and others, spirits, and angels who [were] with [penes] me, to perceive in spiritual idea, how the fall of man [occurred], to wit, that the most ancient church was in faith, and thus in company with spirits and angels, and so united, as to be, as it were, in heaven. Like those best [ones] in another earth [tellure], of whom [I have spoken]; but that they withdrew [desciverint], and so the interiors and intuitions have receded from man, until at this day they are only in externals. - 1748, August 27. </p>
