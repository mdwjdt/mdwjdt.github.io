<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4332</h4><p>4332. About the Jews, and Gabriel<p>When it was asked of the Jews what they had believed about Gabriel, and they replied that he had been a great angel, they were told to ask the others where Gabriel is. They inquired of the others, who said that they had no idea, but they were informed that by Gabriel, as well as the other angels named, nothing else is meant than functions, and thus that any number of angels can be called Gabriel, provided they were in that function. Then they became silent. 1749, 21 July. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Venus, meaning Friday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4332</h4><p>4332. CONCERNING THE JEWS AND GABRIEL.<p>It was asked of certain Jews what they believed respecting Gabriel? They replied that he was a great angel. It was then proposed to them that they should inquire of others where Gabriel was. They did so, and obtained for answer that they knew nothing about it themselves, but they were informed that by Gabriel, and by other angels mentioned by name, are understood functions, and thus that the name Gabriel may be given to innumerable individuals, provided they are in that function. In this they acquiesced. - 1749, July 21. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4332 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4332. De Judaeis, et Gabriele<p>Quaesitum Judaeis, quid crediderint de Gabriele, dicebant quod magnus angelus fuit, dictum iis, ut quaererent alios ubinam Gabriel, quaesiverunt, qui dixerunt se prorsus nescire, sed informati sunt quod per Gabrielem, et per alios angelos nominatos non aliud intelligantur quam functiones: et quod sic innumerabiles dici possint Gabriel, modo in illa functione essent: ita acquieverunt. 1749, 21 Julius. </p>
