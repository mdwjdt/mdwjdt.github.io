<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4680</h4><p>4680. Some are cast into their hell quickly, but in that case they had associated themselves with the hells more inwardly, or they also then associate themselves [with the hells] when they return into their inward qualities together with those with which they had been with in the life of the body. For they had been with them by virtue of their inward qualities, so that when they are let into such common groups, they then cast themselves down more and more into the deep. I have been permitted to see this on several occasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4680</h4><p>4680. Certain ones were cast into their hell more speedily; but, in the meantime, they associated themselves with the hells, or, truly, they are associated [with them] when they return into their internals with those with whom they had been in the life of the body; for their internals were with those. Wherefore, when they are let into such associations, they cast themselves more and more into the abyss. This it was granted me to see on several occasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4680 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4680. Quidam conjiciuntur in infernum suum citius, sed tunc interius consociaverunt se cum infernis, vel etiam tunc consociantur cum in interna sua redeunt cum illis cum quibus fuerant in vita corporis, nam per interna eorum cum illis fuerunt; quare cum mittuntur in consociationes tales, tunc in profundum magis et magis semet dejiciunt: hoc pluries videre mihi datum est. </p>
