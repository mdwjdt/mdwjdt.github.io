<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4419</h4><p>4419. About hypocrites, and those who hurt the dental gums, and about punishments<p>For several days there were hypocrites with me, causing a toothache, but not as severe as the one earlier [<a href="4348.htm">4348</a>, <a href="4413.htm">4413</a>], and finally a rather dull one, almost imperceptible; but the gum was in such a condition that the teeth there were not firm, so that when I touched the teeth and the gums on the right side, they would hurt, and this for several days. Finally, after sleep, I heard that very many were being punished, one after another, and that the punishment passed on into the distance, and up above toward many. The punishment was a special kind of tearing to pieces. I saw that they were those who had been hypocrites, and had been purged, and who had very little of life remaining. They had been gathered together around me, and had created an aura of society, and then a dwelling in the form of a certain society, stretching far out. This was because there were hypocrites around me, who were drawing them, so to speak, within their aura. For where evils are, there are the demons and spirits belonging to that evil. After they had been punished, that pain in the right gum was alleviated, showing what hypocrites are like when they have been purged, namely that they have little life. Except for that latter ache, I felt nothing from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4419</h4><p>4419. CONCERNING HYPOCRITES WHO HURT THE GUMS OF THE TEETH, AND THEIR PUNISHMENTS.<p>There were hypocrites with me for several days who caused a pain in the teeth, but not so violent as before; it became at length a kind of dull and almost insensible pain, but the gum was in such a state, that the teeth were not firm in it, and when I touched the teeth upon the right side and the gums, they were painful; this lasted for several days. At length on waking, I heard that very many were undergoing punishments one after another, and that the punishments passed to a distance and upwards to many; the punishment was a peculiar kind of laceration; it was perceived that they were hypocrites who had been vastated, and had very little life remaining. That they were collected about me and made to themselves a sphere as of a society, and thus a habitation according to the form of a kind of society, extending a long distance, was because there were hypocrites about me, who, as it were, attracted them within their sphere; for where there are evils, there are the genii and spirits of that evil. After they were punished that pain of the gums was still perceived. Hence it may be manifest of what quality hypocrites become when they are vastated, namely, that they have little of life. Except that pain I felt nothing from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4419 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4419. De hypocritis, et qui dentium gingivas laedunt, et poenis<p>Per aliquot dies fuerunt hypocritae apud me, et causabantur dolorem dentium, sed non ita atrocem ut prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4419/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4348" target=_top>4348</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4419/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4413" target=_top>4413</a>], tandem quendam mutum, et quasi insensibilem, sed gingiva erat talis, ut dentes ibi non essent firmi, ut cum tangerem dentes dextrae partis, et gingivas, dolerent, hoc per aliquot dies, tandem post somnum audiebam quod permulti punirentur ordine, et quod punitio transiret in longum et supra ad multos, punitio peculiaris lacerationis fuit, perceptum quod essent illi qui hypocritae fuerunt et devastati, et vix multum residui vitae haberent, quod circum me collecti fuerint, et sibi fecerint sphaeram societatis, et sic habitationem secundum societatis cujusdam formam, et hoc longo tractu, ex causa quia hypocritae erant circum me, qui eos quasi attrahebant intra suam sphaeram, nam ubi mala, ibi genii et spiritus illius mali; postquam puniti leniebatur ille dolor gingivae dextrae, inde constare potest quales fiant hypocritae cum devastati, quod parum vitae; praeter dolorem istum ab iis nihil sentiebam. </p>
