<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2267</h4><p>2267. At that time, some were carried up into heaven, so that they might see or understand how these matters stand, and from there they told me that they were now seeing what a great multitude there were of this or that opinion, thus of different opinions appearing one after the other. So they were able to discern quite clearly how many societies then present differed, and how many agreed. And if they had been in the heaven of angels, they would almost have been able to count the societies closest by, although not find out how a more remote heaven influenced them.<p>Anyone can conclude from this that the Lord knows even the very least details in the universal heaven, as well as in the human race, which is ruled by means of spirits. For it is a gift of the Lord that spirits and angels are able to know such things-a gift that is lessened or increased at His good pleasure. And anyone can also see that the Lord arranges and keeps in order all things down to the very least details, as I also have just grasped by an angelic mental image. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2267</h4><p>2267. Certain were then raised up into heaven that they might see or know how those things were, and thence they told me that they thus saw what a multitude might be of this or that opinion, thus could be within some if it were in order [sic in aliquibus, ordine]: so that they could know plainly enough how many societies then present differed, and how many agreed, and had they been in the heaven of angels could almost have numbered the societies which were nearest, but not [tell] how there was influx into the more remote [non vero quomodo remotius in eos influit]. Hence anyone may conclude that the Lord knows the most single [singularissima] things in the universal heaven, as well as in the human race, which is ruled by spirits for that spirits and angels can know such things is the gift of the Lord, which is diminished and increased at His good pleasure, as well that the Lord disposes each and all things. This I now also perceived by an angelic idea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2267 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2267. Quidam tunc sublati in coelum, ut viderent seu nossent, quomodo illa se haberent, et inde mihi dicebant, quod sic viderent quanta multitudo ab hac vel illa opinione esset, sic in aliquibus, ordine, adeo ut satis manifeste possent nosse, quot societates, tunc praesentes, differrent et quot consentirent, sique in coelo angelorum fuissent, potuissent fere numerari societates, quae proximae, non vero [nosci] quomodo remotius in eos influit; inde quisque concludere potest, quod Dominus novit singularissima in universo coelo, tum in genere humano, quod regitur per spiritus, nam quod spiritus et angeli talia nosse possunt, est donum Domini, quod minuitur augeturque, ad beneplacitum Ipsius, tum quod Dominus disponat et ordinet omnia et singula, quod nunc quoque idea angelica percepi. </p>
