<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>221.关于小孩子的快乐状态。今天早上，我起床之前进入一种平静状态，并在其中停留了一段时间；在这段时间里，我与一个人谈到了这种状态，因为它非常平静，接近平安。但这不是我以前所感觉到的平安，因为我的注意力总是被引向其它事务，尤其被引向某些灵人在我的腰部所造成的一种疼痛，这是他们第二天把我困在这种疼痛中。我还与这个灵人谈论了小孩子的快乐状态，据说他们就生活在这种愉悦状态。我还谈论了这种状态。在周围听我说话，但无法处于这种状态的灵人，以为我被转到另一个地方，因为除了我的声音和属于这声音的东西外，他们无法像以前那样理解任何事物。由此引发了一场关于地方的讨论；这次经历告诉我们，地方并非固定的，尽管许多人能同时在一个地方；地方只是人可以说能被带入其中的某种气场的状态，无论他在什么地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 221</h4><p>221. About the happy state of infants<p>This morning before I arose, I came into a calm state and remained in it for some time; and I spoke with someone during that time about this state - for it was extremely calm, and approached closely to peace. But that it was not the peace I had previously felt, was because my attention was always being drawn to other matters, and specifically to a pain which certain spirits caused me in the region of the loins and had now held me in for a second day - and things of that kind.<p>I spoke with him about that happy state of infants, who were said to live in that pleasurable state. I also spoke about that state [of calm]. The spirits who were round about and able to hear the speaking, but not be in that same state, thought I had been transferred to a different place, because they were not able to grasp anything at all as before, except the sound and its effects. Thence arose a discussion of place, and we were taught by the experience that [a place there] is not a specific location - even though many at the same time can be in one place - but that it is a state belonging to a given realm, if you will, into which one can be brought, in whatever place one may be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 221</h4><p>221. THE HAPPY STATE OF LITTLE CHILDREN <p>This morning before I arose, I came into a tranquil state in which I remained for some time, during which I spoke with a certain one concerning this state, for it was a very tranquil one, and almost amounted to peace. But it was hardly the peace which I perceived before; inasmuch as I was all the time intent upon other matters, and also upon a kind of pain which certain spirits produced around my loins, and in which they have now kept me through another day. I also spoke with that spirit similar things concerning that happy state of little children who were said to live in such a state and in delight; in like manner I spoke concerning that state. The spirits who were round about, and who could hear my speech but could not be in such a state, supposed that I had been transferred to another place because they could not, as before, perceive anything whatever except the sound [of my voice] and things pertaining to sound. As a result of this there was talk about place. By this experience we were taught that place is not fixed, although many can be together in one place; but it is the state of some sphere, as it were, into which man can be carried, in whatever place he may be. 1747, Oct. 27, o.s. </p>
