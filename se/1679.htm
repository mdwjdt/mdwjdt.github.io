I spoke with them further about their offspring, and they said that they have at most 3 or four children, and that their homes are separated from one another. They are content to live in small rooms, one of which was displayed to me. The architecture was very fine, and in a rounded area was a fireplace that shed light to the whole room, where a table stood. At the sides are their beds, but it is only one continuous bed, as long as the wall, and there they lie, one after the other. There was a bedspread, dark orange in color. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;A figure is drawn to the right of this passage that is a rough floor plan. </p>

It was of beautiful architecture, having in a kind of rotunda a hearth that supplied light to the whole apartment, in which was a table. Their sleeping-places are at the sides, where there is one single bed continuously extended, like a wall, where they lie one after another. There was a cover-lid of an obscurely golden color.) </p>
