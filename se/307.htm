<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>307.关于那些被提升至更内层天堂的人。今天又有两个人被提到内层天堂的一个前院，他们从那里与我交谈，大声说，眼睛从未看见，心里从未明白这类事物！我甚至能在自己里面感知到一点点这种幸福本身；事实上，在更内层的天堂，我能感受到被转到那里的一个人所发出的某种快乐；他大声说，他若不被放下去，就无法承受这种喜乐；不过，他因被弥赛亚神的天使所围绕，故能留在那里。（1747年12月5日）<p>在那些被引入更内层天堂的某些居所的人当中，有一个大声说，他正在感受快乐的不断变化，伴随着一种极深的喜乐感。在他们中间还有一个人作为天使的随从被提上去，但他却说，他没有看见这类事物；因此，表面的高度无济于事，只有天堂的内在和更内在的品质才能产生这一切。但上述这二人只在更内层天堂的边缘地带，因为他们死去的时间不长，尚未预备好进入更内在的地方。他们又大声说，快乐的种类多得数不胜数，以至于无法用任何语言来表达它们。他们的确想描述最奇妙的和谐，但却做不到。他们觉得自己似乎被提入第三层天堂，但这只是更内层天堂的前院，如我现在被告知的。（1747年12月5日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 307</h4><p>307. About some who were raised up into the very inward heaven<p>Today again two were raised up into a certain forecourt of the very inward heaven, and from there they spoke with me, saying in a loud voice that the eye had never seen, nor could the mind ever grasp, such things! I even felt the happiness itself in me for a time, as well as a sort of waft of pleasure felt in the very inward heaven by one who had been transferred there, and who cried out, saying that he could not bear the joy, if he were not let down; but being surrounded by angels of God the Messiah, he was able to stay there [cf. 293]. 1747, the 5th day of December.<p>One of them, guided into certain habitations of the very inward heaven, cried out, saying that he was feeling an unceasing variation of delights, accompanied by a very deep sense of joy.<p>Someone was also raised up with them as an angelic companion, but he said that he noticed nothing of the kind; so that apparent height does not accomplish anything, but only the inward and more inward qualities of heaven.<p>But those two were only at the outskirts of the very inward heaven, because, not having been dead for very long, they were still not prepared to enter more inwardly. They cried out again, saying there are countless different kinds of delights, so many that no language could ever give expression to them. They really wanted to describe the very wonderful harmony, but could not. They seemed to themselves to have been caught up into the third heaven, but it was only the forecourt of the very inward heaven, as I am now being told. 1747, the 5th day of December.  </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 307</h4><p>307. CONCERNING THOSE WHO WERE RAISED UP INTO THE MORE INTERIOR HEAVEN <p>Today also two were carried up into a certain court of the interior heaven, and thence spoke with me; and they said in a loud voice that the eye never sees, nor can the mind perceive such things. Indeed, to a small extent I perceived the actual happiness in myself. <sup>1</sup>Even in the more interior heaven I had felt a certain delight breathing forth from him who had been translated thither, who exclaimed and said that he could not sustain the joy if he were not sent down; but having been surrounded by the angels of God Messiah, he was able to tarry there. 1747, Dec. 5. One of these who had been conducted to certain habitations of the more interior heaven, crying out, said that he perceived continued varieties of delights with quite an interior perception of the joy. There was also a certain one taken up with them as an angelic attendant, but yet he said that no such thing was seen by him; so that the apparent height effects nothing, but only the interior and more interior things of heaven. But the two spoken of above were only at the beginning of the more interior heaven, because they had not been dead very long, so that they were not as yet prepared to enter more interiorly. They again cried out, saying, that the varieties of delights were so innumerable that no tongue could ever utter them; they indeed wanted to describe that most wonderful harmony, but could not. They seemed to themselves to be snatched up into the third heaven, but it was only the court of the more interior heaven, as I am now told. 1747, Dec. 5. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Crossed out: "So that I can the more certainly confirm it." </p>

De iis qui in intimius coelum sublati sunt<p>Hodie quoque bini in interioris coeli atrium quoddam sublati sunt, et inde mecum loquuti, et alta voce dicebant, quod nusquam oculus talia vidit, aut mens percipere possit! ipsam felicitatem etiam aliquantis per in me percipiebam, etiam in intimiori coelo sensatam <sup>1</sup></p><p>quandam anhelationem jucundam ab eo qui illuc erat translatus, clamans et dicens, quod non sustinere possit gaudium, si non dimitteretur, sed angelis Dei Messiae circumdatus, ibi potuit morari 1747 die 5 Dec. Unus ex iis in quasdam mansiones intimioris coeli perductus, clamans dicebat, quod continuas varietates delitiarum, cum intimiori perceptione gaudii, perciperet.Quidam etiam cum iis erat quoque ut comes angelicus sublatus, sed usque ei nihil tale visum esse dicebat, sic ut altitudo apparens nihil efficiat, sed modo interiora et intimiora coeli. Sed bini illi erant modo in principio intimioris coeli, quia non ita diu erant mortui, sic ut ad huc non praeparati intimius intrare; iterum clamabant dicentes, quod delitiarum innumerabiles varietates essent <sup>2</sup></p><p>, ut nusquam aliqua loquela eas enuntiare possit; harmoniam mirabilissimam describere quidem volebant, sed non potuerunt. Videbantur sibi in tertium coelum rapti, sed modo erat atrium intimioris coeli, sicut nunc mihi dicitur. 1747, d. 5 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript in sensatam emendatum fuisse nobis videtur<p>2.&nbsp;In the Manuscript esset in essent emendatum esse videtur </p>
