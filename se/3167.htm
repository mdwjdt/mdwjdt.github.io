<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3167</h4><p>3167. Respect of persons is also observed in the other life, when they are good<p>Many times I have observed that persons who had been endowed in the world with the highest dignity, such as kings, who were born kings and derived this from infancy, are endowed with dignity [in the other life] and are above others, being unable to hide or cast off that aura until after many years, perhaps 100, 1000. Nevertheless, the aura of that dignity is joined with the aura of uprightness and goodness in such a way that it does not trouble anyone. To those who were born such and are upright and good, a certain kind of appropriate subordination is shown by moral spirits, for an upright spirit has the quality of hurting no one, and being favorable to everyone.<p>For this reason I was inspired to tell a certain spirit who did not have the appropriate aura [of subordination], when he was found out to be different, that there was something lacking in him by way of outer restraint, and that when this is lacking, he easily falls into his own nature. 1748, 15 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3167</h4><p>3167. THAT RESPECT OF PERSONS IS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE OTHER LIFE WHEN THEY ARE GOOD. <p>(It was many times observed, that persons [who] in the world [were] endowed with the greatest dignity, for instance, kings, who are born kings, and have derived from infancy [their] endowment with dignity and superiority to others, that these cannot conceal or throw off that sphere, until after many years, perhaps 100 [or] 1000. But still the sphere of that dignity is so conjoined with the sphere of probity and goodness, as not to be troublesome to anyone. To those who are born so, and are upright and good, there is also shown a certain kind of corresponding subordination by moral spirits: for it [belongs] to a good spirit to injure no one, but to do a favor to everyone. Wherefore, a certain one, who did not have such a corresponding sphere, being discovered to be of another character, it was given to tell him, that there was something lacking to him in external bonds: which, as it was lacking, he easily rushed into his own nature. - 1748, September 15.) </p>
