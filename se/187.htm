<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>187.关于灵人，分开和结合。大多数情况下，灵人作为一个社群与许多同类一起行动。他们还经常作为一个社群与我交谈，我能清楚觉察这一事实。此外，还有些灵人是分开的，他们似乎靠自己说话。不过，他们分开的目的是为了接受其他人和许多同类的推理，将其集合起来，从而与我交谈。当这些灵人似乎离开我时，他们觉得又回到自己的同类那里，以便过一种与他们结合的生活。不同的种类通过许多迹象加以区分，甚至通过他们说话的声音来区分；当一起交谈和做事时，他们就通过某种不同的低语和噪声来区分彼此。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 187</h4><p>187. About spirits when apart, and when together<p>For the most part, spirits act in company with many of the same species. With me also they have many times spoken in company - a fact I was enabled to perceive plainly. But besides this, there are spirits apart, seemingly speaking on their own, but who are apart for the purpose of taking in and, let us say, collecting the reasonings of others - in fact, of many species belonging to their own kind - and then of speaking with me.<p>When these spirits seemed to have departed from me, they fell back to their own species in order to pursue a compatible life with them. The diverse species are distinguishable by many indications. They are also differentiated by the sounds of their speech and, when they are conversing and doing things together, by a characteristic murmuring noise. 1747, the 28th day of August (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 187</h4><p>187. CONCERNING SPIRITS, SEPARATE AND CONJOINED <p>For the most part, spirits act as a society with many of the same species. They have also as a society frequently spoken with me, which it was given me manifestly to perceive. But there are, in addition, separate spirits who speak as it were from themselves; but they were separated in order that they might receive and gather together, as it were, the reasonings of others and indeed of very many species of the same kind and so speak with me. When these spirits seemed to have departed from me, they fell back again to their own species, that they might lead a life conjointly with them. Different species, moreover, distinguish themselves by many indications, even by the sounds of their speech; and when they are together and converse and act, they are distinguished one from another by a certain differing murmuring and noise. 1747, Aug. 28, o.s. </p>

Species diversae, praeterea quod distinguant se, per plura indicia, etiam ex sonis eorum loquelae, et dum simul sunt, colloquuntur et agunt, ex quodam differenti murmuratione et constrepitu, interstinguuntur. 1747, die 28 Aug. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has mihil </p>
