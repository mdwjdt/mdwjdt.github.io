<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2481</h4><p>2481. For this is the nature of evil spirits. Whatever there is of good and truth, from an innate urge they at once resist, reject-rejecting them as falsities, and eagerly accepting untruths, which are extremely flattering to them because they agree with and favor them. 1748, 1 July.<p>Their resistance I was prompted to compare with smells, for their aura contrary to truths makes up their character, so that the moment a truth comes along there is something unpleasant that strikes the sense of smell. This they also are now hearing and cannot help acknowledging, for they have at times been told that they produce an aura of that kind, because I have been made to sensate it. So these things have been told from pure experience. 1748, 1 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2481</h4><p>2481. For such are evil spirits, that whatever good and true there is they immediately from an innate principle resist [and] reject, - reject amongst falsities, and willingly accept falses, because these are exceedingly satisfactory to their [arrident iis], inasmuch as they agree, and are conformable. - 1748, July 1. - It is given to compare their aversion with smells, for their disposition forms a sphere contrary to truths; wherefore, immediately when a truth approaches that sphere, there is, as it were, something injurious [iniquum] that strikes the smell; which they also now hear, and cannot but acknowledge, inasmuch as it is sometimes told them that they form such a sphere, because it [was] made sensible to me: thus these things are told from pure experience. - 1748, July 1. </p>
