<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4713</h4><p>4713. I then also spoke with certain ones in a city that they traveled to over a long, paved bridge. Certain prelates came, and I spoke with them about the Lord, saying that in Him the Trinity is completed, which I also demonstrated from the Word, and that as a result there is one God, not many, as is the case for those who in their thinking separate God into persons. Then the elders there said that they acknowledge one God, but only the Father, and that they use the names Son and Holy Spirit. However, they do not think of these as gods. But I asked them whether they had any idea of the Father. I discerned that they had none other than of something like the infinite universe, without limit. But it was said that in that case thought cannot be focused and fixed, still less affection. The simple said that they wanted to have a God about whom they can think, who receives their thoughts, and by whom they can be touched with love, and that this can never be possible if their idea of God is like one of the universe without limit. It was shown to them further that this idea falls entirely into nature and as a result the acknowledgment of God perishes. And It was shown to them that when they thought about nature in general, their idea slid down into the same thing when they thought about God, which I have commented on earlier, with the result that for them nature is God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4713</h4><p>4713. I also spoke, at that time, with certain ones in a city, to which they proceeded over a long, level bridge. Certain prelates came; and I spoke with them concerning the Lord, that in Him is a perfect Trine, which was also shown from the Word, and that, therefore, God is one, not several, as He is in the thought of those who divide Him into persons. Thereupon, the elders there said that they acknowledge one God, but only the Father; and that they name the Son and Holy Spirit, but do not think of these as of Gods; but they were asked, whether they had any idea concerning the Father? It was perceived that they had no other, than, as it were, of an infinite universe, without boundary; but it was said that thought cannot then be determined and fixed, still less the affection. The simple said that they wished to have a God of whom they can think, and who receives their thoughts, and by whom they can be affected with love; and that they can by no means do so, if God, in the idea, is such as a universe without a boundary. It was further shown that this idea falls wholly into nature; and thus the acknowledgment of God perishes. Then it was shown, that, when they thought concerning nature in general, the idea fell into a similar notion with that they entertain about God whereof I have written before; so that, to them, nature is God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4713 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4713. Loquutus etiam tunc sum cum quibusdam in urbe, ad quam progrediebantur super pontem stratum longum, quidam antistites venerunt, et cum illis loquutus sum de Domino, quod in Ipso Trinum perfectum sit, quod etiam ex Verbo ostensum, et quod sic unus Deus sit, non plures sicut est illis cogitatione qui distinguunt in personas, dein presbyteri ibi dicebant quod agnoscant unum Deum sed solum Patrem, et quod nominent Filium et Spiritum sanctum, sed non cogitent de his ut de diis, sed dictum illis, num aliquam ideam de Patre haberent, percipiebatur quod non aliam quam sicut de universo infinito, absque termino, sed dictum quod tunc cogitatio non determinari et figi queat, minus affectio, dicebant simplices, quod illi velint habere Deum de quo cogitare possint, et qui recipit cogitationes suas, et quo affici amore possint, et quod nequaquam possint si Deus sit in idea talis qualis est universum absque termino: ostensum porro, quod haec idea cadat omnino in naturam, et sic pereat agnitio Dei: dein ostensum cum cogitarent de natura in communi, quod caderet idea in simile cum Deo, de qua prius, sic ut illis natura sit Deus. </p>
