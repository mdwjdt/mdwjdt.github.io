<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2146</h4><p>2146. When a spirit is speaking in a way that he is unaware that it is not he alone speaking, and that there are others who are speaking the same things at the same time, it can be called simultaneous speech.<p>There were some who spoke in this way, and I spoke at the same time, and those who heard said afterwards that I had spoken, while one who was speaking the same words thought that it was he alone, not knowing that others were saying the same words at the same time. 1748, 31 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2146</h4><p>2146. Whilst a spirit speaks, in order that he may not know different than that it is he alone who speaks, although there are others who simultaneously speak the same, a speech [occurs] that may be called simultaneous speech. There were some who thus spoke, and I at the same time, and such as heard afterwards said that it was I who spoke, and he who thus addressed me was thinking that he was alone, and did not know that others simultaneously were saying the same thing. - 1748, May 31. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2146 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2146. Dum spiritus loquitur, ut nesciat aliter quam quod solus sit, qui loquitur, et tamen alii sint, qui simul idem loquuntur, vocari potest loquela simultanea; fuerunt qui loquuti sunt ita, et ego simul, et dixerunt postea, qui audiverunt, quod ego loquutus sum, cum is qui loquebatur similes voces, putabat quod solus esset, non sciens quod alii simul idem loquerentur. 1748, 31 Maj. </p>
