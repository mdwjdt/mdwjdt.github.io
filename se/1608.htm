<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1608</h4><p>1608. Since only belief must be present in everything as action,<p>it follows that the Lord Alone must be in each and every aspect of a person<p>It was shown before [<a href="1471.htm">1471</a>] how the heavenly [angels] in one idea conceive of acts of charity, of charity, and of belief based on understanding, namely, that there is nothing but belief, <sup>1</sup>the other things not appearing. Hence it follows that the Lord Alone must be in each and every aspect because the belief is in Him, and the belief is from Him, therefore the belief is the Lord, and from this follow those matters of belief that few perceive. 1748, 20 March. At the same time it follows from this that the Lord Alone lives, and that heaven, the world and the earth are dead, and live from Him.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the number referred to, it says "nothing but affection," and in the index under the words Amor, Angelus, Dominus and Fides, it says "they know nothing in charity and works than only affection or belief." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1608</h4><p>1608. BECAUSE FAITH WILL BE [ERIT] ACTUALLY OR VIRTUALLY THE ONLY PRINCIPLE IN ALL THINGS [PERTAINING TO SPIRITUAL LIFE], IT FOLLOWS THAT THE LORD ONLY WILL BE IN ALL AND SINGULAR THE THINGS OF MAN. <p>It has been previously shown how the celestials perceive in idea the works of charity, charity itself, and faith in the understanding namely, that there is nothing else [in them] than faith, other qualities not appearing; it hence follows that the Lord alone is in all and singular things, because faith [is to be directed] to Him, faith is from Him, and therefore the Lord is faith itself; hence follow the various things of faith, which few perceive. - 1748, March 20. It is at the same time hence also that the Lord alone lives, and heaven, the world, and the earth are [in themselves] dead, deriving life solely from Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1608 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1608. Quia sola fides erit in omnibus, in actu, sequitur quod Solus Dominus erit in omni et singulis hominis<p>Prius ostensum est [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1608/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1471" target=_top>1471</a>], quomodo coelestes idea percipiunt opera charitatis, charitatem fidem intellectu, nempe quod nihil sit nisi fides, caetera non apparent {a}: inde sequitur quod Solus Dominus erit in omnibus singulis quia in Ipsum fides ab Ipso fides, ideo fides est Dominus, inde sequuntur ea fidei, quae pauci percipiunt. 1748, 20 Martius. Simul inde [sequitur], quod Dominus Solus vivit coelum, mundus terra, mortui sunt ab Ipso vivunt. </p>
