<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4035</h4><p>4035. While those mucus spirits were flowing in, I noticed that they were moving my tongue toward a decayed tooth; at the same time I also felt at the back of my neck a bite like that of lice; then also an itching on the buttocks, caused by them.<p>4035. 1/2.<p>They spoke with me further also as if in the throat or windpipe, without any tone, only a kind of vibrating wind, saying that their speech with people on earth was like this, within. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4035</h4><p>4035. When those mucus-spirits flowed in, it was perceived that they moved my tongue towards a decayed tooth; there was then also on the back of the neck a sense of biting as of lice; then an itching in the nates; all which was from them.<p>4035a. 1-2. They farther spoke with me also as if in the throat or trachea, yet without sound, and solely by a certain self-vibrating wind, saying that such was their inward speech with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4035 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4035. Cum muci isti influerent, tunc perceptum quod moverent linguam versus dentem putridum; tum quoque ad collum posterius sentitus morsus sicut pediculorum; tum in natibus titillatio; quae ab iis.<p>4035b. Porro loquuti quoque mecum sicut in gutture seu trachea, absque sono, solum quodam vibrante se vento, dicentes, quod talis eorum loquela cum homine erat intus. </p>
