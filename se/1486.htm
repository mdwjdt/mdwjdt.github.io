<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1486</h4><p>1486. This is the punishment of those who do not say what they are thinking, but play tricks under the guise of speaking true things. They are the kind who, on coming into the other life and realizing that they must not speak differently than they think, and that their companion spirits, as well as others, are aware of their thoughts, then strive to free themselves of this problem by speaking truths, but still as a ruse so that they can mix into good societies and then carry out the cunning practices they had followed in life. By these tricks they imagine they are being let in, even thinking that no one sees this, when yet it appears very openly. These spirits are driven into those swirls, and become like hanging garments, without a body. 1748, 18 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1486</h4><p>1486. This is the punishment of those who do not say what they think, but plan schemes under the cover of speaking truths. For they are those who when they enter the other life, and perceive that they must not speak otherwise than as they think, and that their companions and other spirits perceive their thoughts, then study how to free themselves from this by speaking truths. But they do this with the design that they may thus be among good societies, and so be able to practice the artifices which they had practiced during their life. By means of such schemes they suppose that they are admitted, and even suppose that no one perceives it, when nevertheless it appears most obviously. These spirits are tossed about in such whirls, and become like hanging garments without a body. 1748, Mar. 18. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1486 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1486. Poena est eorum, quo non dicunt quod cogitant, sed <sup>1</sup></p><p>technas condunt, sub eo, quod vera loquantur, sunt enim, qui dum in alteram vitam veniunt, et percipiunt quod non aliter loquendum quam quod cogitant, cum percipiunt quod spiritus socii aliique cogitata eorum percipiant, tunc se liberare student ex eo, quod vera loquantur, sed usque per technam, ut sic interese possint societatibus bonis, et sic artificia sua, quae exercuerunt in vita, exercere, per tales technas putant se admitti, et quidem putant quod nullus id percipiat, quod tamen manifetissime apparet; ii in tales verticillos aguntur, et fiunt sicut vestimenta pendula, absque corpore. 1748, 18 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has cogitant; sed </p>
