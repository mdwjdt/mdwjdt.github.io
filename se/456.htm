<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第456节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>456.当善灵被提升到更内在的天堂，然后回来时，他们觉得好像与一个人同在，这个人进入甜蜜的睡眠，并如同在完全清醒的状态下那样看见更内在的事物和他们的荣耀。你会看到前面（319-21节）所提到的，灵人被转入许多醒着和睡眠的状态。在我看来，有一个善灵似乎进入甜蜜的睡眠；有几次当灵人的状态传我时，我被恩准体验这一点。这位天使一醒来，或在我看来一醒来，就讲述说，他一直在观看弥赛亚神的荣耀，这是我在他的睡眠中被允许隐隐约约看到的。我由此能断定：将灵人转入天堂，或将天上的人转入更内在的天堂，就其较低的官能而言，就像一场睡眠。我从经历可以证明，在这样的睡眠中，事物看上来就像当一个人完全清醒时那样鲜活。因此，当更内在的心智被夺走时，它的较低官能就变得静止，好像它不存在一样，因为较低之物不能被转入较高之物。（1748年1月8日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 456</h4><p>456. When good spirits are raised up into a more inward heaven then return, it seems just as if the person [they are with] has fallen into a sweet sleep sees the more inward regions their glory, as if in complete wakefulness That spirits also are transferred into very many states of waking sleeping, you may told [<a href="319.htm">319-321</a>]. It appeared me as if a particular good spirit had fallen into a sweet sleep - something I have been allowed experience several times when the state of spirits has been communicated me. This angel, upon awakening (or so it seemed me) reported that he had beheld the glory of God the Messiah, which I was allowed to very dimly in his sleep. Hence I was able infer that the transfer of spirits into heaven, or of heavenly beings into a more inward heaven, is like a sleep as their <sup>1</sup>lower mental powers. And I can testify from experience, that during that sleep, things seem just as plainly alive as when one is wide awake. Therefore, the lower mental power comes to rest, as though it did not exist, when the more inward mind is raised up. For what is lower cannot be transferred into what is higher. 1748, the 8th day of January.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original has "ejus," "his." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 456</h4><p>456. THAT WHEN GOOD SPIRITS WHO HAVE BEEN CARRIED AWAY INTO THE MORE INTERIOR HEAVEN RETURN, IT SEEMS [TO THEM] AS IT IS WITH A MAN WHO HAS FALLEN INTO A SWEET SLEEP IN WHICH HE SEES, AS IN FULLEST WAKEFULNESS, THINGS MORE INTERIOR, AND THE GLORY OF THEM <p>You will see it stated above [nos. <a href="../se/319.htm">319-320</a>, that spirits are transferred into very many states of wakefulness and sleep. A certain good spirit seemed to me to have fallen as if into a sweet sleep, which was sometimes granted me to perceive by the communication of the state of those who were with me. When he, who was an angel, awoke, as it seemed to me, he related that he had been contemplating the Glory of God Messiah, which it was granted me to see very obscurely in his sleep. Hence it can be concluded that the translation of spirits into heaven, or of the heavenly ones into a more interior heaven, resembles sleep in respect to his lower faculties; and that in such sleep, things appear just as manifestly alive as in fullest wakefulness. This I can testify from experience. Therefore, when the more interior mind is taken away, its lower faculty becomes quiescent as though it did not exist, for that which is lower cannot be transferred into that which is higher. 1748, Jan. 8. </p>
