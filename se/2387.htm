<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2387</h4><p>2387. About the state of the world of spirits before the coming of the Lord<p>I spoke with those in heaven about the state of spirits or the world of spirits before the coming of the Lord into the world, saying that it was in like condition as was faith with people on earth at that time-especially with the Jews, who were in possession of higher knowledge-namely, that the greater part had not known there is a life after death, which many openly denied. Nor were the Pharisees who defended it convinced of the resurrection of the dead, as is evident from the Word of the Lord [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_27.htm">Luke 20:27-38</a>].<p>Such, in the first place, were the spirits in the world of spirits before the coming of the Lord. In the second place, they absolutely did not know that the Messiah was to come in order to save them to eternity, in a Kingdom that would last to eternity, only thinking that He would make them lords on earth, and so would raise up with them the uppermost earthly kingdom. This kind of notion flourishes at the present day, and therefore neither did the spirits know that the Lord was to come for the salvation of souls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2387</h4><p>2387. CONCERNING THE STATE OF THE WORLD OF SPIRITS BEFORE THE ADVENT OF THE LORD. <p>I spoke with those in heaven, concerning the state of spirits, or of the world of spirits, before the Lord's advent into the world; that it had been of such a quality as was then the faith of men on earth, especially among the Jews, who were in knowledges, to wit, that many had been ignorant that there is a life after death. Very many openly denied it. The Pharisees who defended it were not such as were persuaded of the resurrection of the body, as appears from the Lord's Word. Such were the spirits in the world of spirits before the advent of the Lord. I saw this firstly. Another point was, that they were wholly ignorant that Messiah was to come, in order to save them to eternity, in a kingdom that would last to eternity, but only that he would make them lords in the world, and thus they were ignorant the Lord would come, on account of the salvation of souls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2387 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2387. De statu mundi spirituum ante adventum Domini<p>Loquutus sum cum iis in coelo, de statu spirituum seu mundi spirituum ante adventum Domini in mundum, quod fuerit talis, qualis hominum fides tunc fuit in terra, cumprimis apud Judaeos, qui in cognitionibus essent, nempe, quod ignoraverint plerique quod vita post mortem, quam plures aperte negarunt; Pharisaei qui defendebant, nec tales erant, ut persuasi essent, sicut constat ex Verbo Domini de resurrectione mortuorum [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2387/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_20_27-38" target=_top>Luc. XX: 27-38</a>]: tales primum fuerunt spiritus in mundo spirituum ante Domini adventum. Alterum erat, quod nescirent prorsus, Messiam venturum, ut salvaret eos in aeternum, in Regno in aeternum duraturo, sed solum quod eos dominos faceret in terris, et sic regnum terrestre ad summum <sup>1</sup></p><p>apud eos extolleret <sup>2</sup></p><p>: qualis opinio ad hodiernum diem viget, quare tales fuerunt spiritus, quod nescirent Dominum venturum, ob salutem animarum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has sumnum<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has extollerit </p>
