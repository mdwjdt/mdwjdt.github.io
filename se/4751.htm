<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4751</h4><p>4751. I observed that he, C[harles] XII, had a greater ability to take note of things than others, for when he was engaged in inner thought he was able to go through a hundred things in the glance of an eye and consider what their nature was in relation to his goal, which was to be in control, and to see how he could manage them, which he did, in his favor. From this is evident what acumen and so-to-speak intelligence the evil enjoy, particularly the deceitful. But they are purged nevertheless to the point that they become greater fools than others.</p><p>[2] The goal of C[harles] XII's life, which he pursued with supreme obstinacy, was to harness what is Divine for the sake of his own power to the point that he wanted to die like Sampson. For the sake of this, he hurled himself from the back side into a cloud where there were Anakim or evil ones of the most ancient Church, wanting to stir them up and so gain power. There he was then desolated by them as to his intellect because to be joined with them is to perish as regards everything having to do with the intellect. But because he had gone only a little way into the cloud, he continued on for the purpose of persecuting the Divine, although he was stupid [to do so], because his resolve, his will, remained unchanged. This happened above the swamp on the right side, which no one can cross without being suffocated. There he lost what remained of his intellect, that is to say, his ability to think, and in the end he was led back to a cave that is on the outskirts of both and was sunk down there, where he is more of a fool than others in the degree of his desire to exercise control, even over the Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4751</h4><p>4751. It was observed that he (Charles XII) excelled others in the faculty of taking inward note of things; for, when he was in interior thought, he could, almost with a glance of the eye, go over a hundred things, and examine of what quality they were in relation to his end, which was dominion; also, how he might be able to dispose them, which, too, he did, to suit himself. Hence it was evident what acuteness and, as it were, intellectual power the malignant enjoy, especially the deceitful; but they are vastated to such a degree as to become more foolish than others. Charles XII's end in life was to most obstinately insist on subjugating the Divine, for the sake of his own rule, and this to such a pitch, that he wished to die like Samson; wherefore he cast himself into a cloud, at the hinder part, where were the Anakim, or evil ones of the Most Ancient Church; and he wished to stir them up, and so prevail. In that place, he was then vastated, by them, as to his intellectual faculty; for to be conjoined with them is to perish as to everything intellectual. But as he came only slightly into the cloud, he proceeded, although he was stupid, to pursue the Divine still farther, - for, his resolution or will remained - and this he did over a pond on the right side, which no one can pass over without being suffocated. In that place, he utterly lost the remainder of the intellectual, or of thought, and was at length brought to a cave which is in the confines of both [the cloud and pool], and was there plunged beneath, where he is foolish above others in the degree of the cupidity of ruling, even over the Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4751 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4751. Observatum quod ille C: XII facultate appercipiendi polluerit prae aliis, nam cum in interiori cogitatione fuit, potuit ictu oculi paene pertransire centum, et lustrare quales essent respective ad finem qui fuit dominium, tum quomodo illos disponere posset, quod etiam fecit ad sui favorem, inde patuit, quo acumine et quasi intellectuali gaudent maligni, imprimis dolosi, sed vastantur usque adeo ut fiant fatui prae aliis.<p>[2] Finis vitae C. XII, erat quod obstinatissime insisteret subjugare Divinum, sui dominii causa, usque ut vellet sicut Simson mori, quare conjecit se a parte posteriore in nubem ubi Enakim seu mali ab antiquissima Ecclesia, et voluit illos excitare et sic valere, ibi tunc quoad intellectuale suum ab illis devastatus est, nam conjungi cum illis, est perire quoad omne intellectuale; sed quia solum venit parum in nubem, pergebat ulterius ad persequendum Divinum, tametsi stupidus, nam remanebat resolutio seu voluntas, et hoc super stagnum ad latus dextrum, quod nemo transire potest, nisi suffocetur, ibi reliquum intellectualis seu cogitationis deperdidit, et tandem reductus est ad antrum, quod in confinio utriusque, et ibi demersus, ubi est fatuus prae reliquis, in gradu cupiditatis dominandi, etiam super Divinum. </p>
