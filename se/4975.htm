<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4975</h4><p>4975. Because this was the case, this mountain, together with the mountains around it where there was similar religion, sank from its height to the level of the horizon, where after this they wandered about. And they were no longer able from their all-around view from the height to exercise control over the lands round about, because when they exercised control, they did all kinds of harm to those who did not want to worship them and their deities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4975</h4><p>4975. Because this was the case, that mountain, with the mountains round about, where was a similar religion, sank down from its altitude even to the plane of the horizon, where they afterwards wandered; nor were they longer able, by looking abroad from the height, to rule over the lands round about; for when they ruled, they did all kinds of evil to those who were not willing to worship them and their deities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4975 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4975. Quia ita erat, mons ille, cum montibus circumcirca, ubi similis religio, subsidit ex altitudine sua usque ad horizontis planum ubi postea vagabantur, nec amplius ex circumspectione ab altitudine potuerunt dominari super terras circumcirca, cum enim dominabantur, omnia mala fecerunt illis qui non eos et numina eorum colere vellent. </p>
