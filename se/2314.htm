<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2314</h4><p>2314. when this matter was being shown by means of figurative spiritual mental imagery, and yet when these [reasonings] are removed, the light appears. So it is impossible for someone to see any truth while sunk into such reasonings, whereas the light is plainly visible to boys and girls, to women, and to those called the uneducated.<p>These points were so well demonstrated by figurative spiritual mental imagery, and consequently I see in such clear light that this is the case, that it is quite impossible to deny it. But how spiritual truths are not only overclouded, so as to be as none, but also how they are distorted, will be told elsewhere, if the Lord finds it fitting. 1748, 12 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2314</h4><p>2314. Since such things were exhibited by representative spiritual ideas, and yet the light can appear when these things are removed, therefore that it is impossible for any truth to be seen by him who is immersed in such things, when yet the light can appear to boys, women, and the untaught who give heed; this was so demonstrated by spiritual representative ideas, and therefore [shown] me in clear light that such was the case, that it can never be denied. But how spiritual truths are not only obscured so as to be, as it were, none, but are also perverted, [I shall treat] elsewhere, if the Lord think worthy. - 1748, June 12. </p>
