<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2630</h4><p>2630. But these do not appear to the person as necessities, for he or she seem to themselves to think and act on their own, and of course for the reason that they are led by what they love, or the objects of their love, consequently by what they desire, and so they are bent toward goodness. Whatever is done from some love or desire appears to a person as free, hence it appears as not a necessity, when yet it is through such necessities that the person is led and bent by the Lord toward whatever good is possible in view of his or her life and the spiritual and heavenly qualities of life. 1748, 17 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2630</h4><p>2630. But they do not appear to man as necessities, for he seems to himself to think of himself and act of himself, and indeed for the reason that by those things which he loves, or which belong to his loves, therefore which he desires, he is led and so bent to good; whatever happens from any love or cupidity this appears to man [as] free, therefore appears as if [it were] not a necessity, when yet such are the necessities by which man is led, and he is bent by the Lord to such good [for him] [ejus] as is at all possible in respect to his life and the spiritual and celestial things of life. - 1748, July 17. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2630 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2630. Sed non apparent homini ut necessitates, nam ex se cogitare, et ex se agere, sibi videtur, et quidem ex causa, quod per ea, quae amat, seu quae ejus amoris sunt, proinde quae cupit [ducatur] <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et sic flectitur ad bonum; quodcunque fit ex aliquo amore, seu cupiditate, hoc apparet homini liberum, proinde apparet sicut nulla necessitas, cum tamen tales necessitates sunt per quas homo ducitur, et flectitur a Domino in bonum ejus, tale, quod usquam possibile est respective ad ejus vitam, et vitae spiritualia et coelestia. 1748, 17 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
