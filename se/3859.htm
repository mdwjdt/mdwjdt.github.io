<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3859</h4><p>3859. They who lie in wait at night<p>There were some who were lying in wait for me at night, when I was sleeping. Upon awakening, I felt a large man at my back, who was therefore gently thrust down, and while being thrust down, was constantly uttering a sound of hoarse speech. The spirits were wondering to what place he would be thrust down, it was felt to be toward the buttocks, and from there into an excremental hell. For to attack a person at night when he is sleeping, is abominable, for which reason such draw this kind of punishment to themselves. 1748, 4 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3859</h4><p>3859. WHO LIE IN WAIT BY NIGHT.<p>There were those who plotted against me by night, whilst I slept. Having awoke, I felt a certain large man behind, who was gently thrust down, and while in the act of detrusion, he continually uttered the sound of a hoarse speech. The spirits wondering whither he would be thrust, he was felt towards the posteriors, and that he would then be cast into a disgusting hell; for to plot against man when he is asleep is abominable, wherefore such draw down punishment upon themselves. - 1748, November 4. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3859 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3859. Qui noctu insidiantur<p>Erant qui noctu insidiabantur mihi, cum dormirem, evigilatus, sentiebam magnum quendam a tergo, qui ideo detrusus lente, et dum in detrusione erat sonabat jugiter rauca loquela, spiritus mirati ubinam detruderetur, sentiebatur versus nates, quod ibi in infernum excrementitium; nam insidiari noctu homini cum dormit, est abominabile, quare talem poenam sibi attrahunt. 1748, 4 Nov. </p>
