<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2459</h4><p>2459. People should never be judged in respect to their life after death on the basis of outward behavior<p>Clear examples were demonstrated of people I had known in the life of the body, showing that those about whom people had judged evilly in the other life are good, and those about whom people had judged well in the life of the body, are evil, because people do not know how to judge except from the outsides. Nor do they know whether [others acted] out of ignorance, nor from what motive. For the motive is known to the Lord Alone. 1748, 30 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2459</h4><p>2459. THAT MAN CAN NEVER BE JUDGED FROM EXTERNAL HABITS [habitu] AS TO WHAT HIS LIFE WILL BE AFTER DEATH. <p>Manifest examples of those whom I have known in the life of the body were shown [to prove] that they of whom men judged harshly are good in the other life, and they of whom men judged well in the life of the body are evil, because men do not know how to judge but from externals; nor do they know whether [persons] act from ignorance, and what was their end; for the end is known to the Lord alone. - -1748, June 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2459 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2459. Quod ab externo habitu, nusquam de homine judicandum quoad vitam ejus post mortem<p>Manifesta exempla eorum quos cognovi in vita corporis, ostensa sunt, quod ii, de quibus male judicarunt homines, quod in altera vita, sint boni, et de quibus homines in vita corporis judicarunt bene, quod mali sint, quia homines non norunt nisi ab externis judicare; nec sciunt num ab ignorantia, et ex quo fine, finis enim notus est Soli Domino. 1748, 30 Junius. </p>
