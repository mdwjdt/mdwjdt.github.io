<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2059</h4><p>2059. They also learned how people's mental images that are mixed with opposite and foreign elements must be separated and set aside, for these recur in their every thought; and there being so many spirits, some arouse this mixed image, some that one, and the result is confusion.<p>Of course, this is not so harmful in bodily and earthly matters as it is in spiritual ones. When spiritual matters become mixed in with and contaminated by filthy terrestrial, bodily, and earthly elements, this prevents a soul from being able to be transferred into heavenly societies. For the societies, being a communion of the ideas of many spirits, sense at once whatever they abominate and abhor. Whatever has been mixed in with a given mental image, which the spirit thinks to be hidden, they nonetheless plainly see, for which reason that spirit cannot but be removed from that society until the polluted mental images are purified. For heavenly spirits are gifted with a most exquisite perception of all the components [of an idea], and if [an opposing component] is not noticed in one state, still it will be in another, and the more plainly as it more closely approaches the state opposite to the filthy mental images.<p>So the soul can certainly be let into heaven, but only in certain states, and into certain societies, many additional precautions being taken through the way in which the spirits are arranged. 1748, 23 May. This the spirits also confessed who had been raised up into heaven, and they did so in a tone of voice as if they were entirely convinced. # # </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2059</h4><p>2059. CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO WAS RAPT AND BORNE AWAY TO HEAVEN. <p>They perceived also how the ideas of a man, that are mixed up with those that are contrary and foreign, are to be entirely separated and distinguished, for they recur in all their train of thought. And since there are so many spirits, some excite one mixed idea, and some another, whence confusion arises, which, however, is not so hurtful in corporeal and natural things as in spiritual, where spiritual ideas are mixed up and infected with foul, terrestrial, corporeal, and natural ones, as this hinders the soul from being transferred into celestial societies; for the societies at once perceive those things which they abominate, and they are filled with abhorrence, inasmuch as there is a communion of ideas among many, and whatever there is of a mixed nature in any one idea, though it may be thought to be concealed, yet it is manifestly perceived, wherefore it cannot be otherwise than that it should be removed from that society, and the pollution occasioned by it be removed; for a most exquisite perception is given to the celestials of all composites, which if they are not perceived in one state they are in another, and the more manifestly, the nearer to the state which is contrary to defiled ideas. In this way a soul may be admitted into heaven, but only in certain states and among certain societies, with numerous precautions effected by the ordering of spirits (1748, May 23); which they who were raised into heaven acknowledged and in a voice that indicated a full persuasion.) <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup></p>
