<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>435.关于通过头巾所施的惩罚，经历这种惩罚的人由于加与他们的幻觉而觉得自己似乎在一种伸展到很远的地方，可能有好几英里的头巾之下。这种头巾就像一层薄薄而连贯的云，这云照着幻觉的力量而变得更加密集。在它下面的那些人因此焦躁不安，沿着它的长宽到处跑来跑去，试图从头巾中挣脱出来。他们以不同的速度和不同的力量突围，直到最后筋疲力尽，要么躺下，要么双脚朝上，头朝下。这一过程可能会持续很长一段时间，直到他们的愤怒止息。这样一种头巾被引入那些尽管看见真理，却由于从他们的爱所迸发出的各种理由，如他们所承认的，而无法获得真理之人的幻觉。但由于他们因这些理由而不断生气，以致他们与自己所看到的真理作斗争。这样的头巾就对应于他们的幻觉。现在他们告诉我说，他们正在被解救自己的欲望，一种在他们里面被点燃的欲望悲惨地折磨。（1747年12月31日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 435</h4><p>435. As for punishment by means of the veil, those undergoing it seem to themselves, because of the illusions imposed upon them, to be under a veil stretching out to a great distance, sometimes for miles. The veil is like a thin but unbroken cloud, which thickens according to the power of the illusion. And so they get upset and run about, here and there, far and wide, trying to break out of the veil. They go at varying speeds and with varying force, until finally, exhausted, they either lie down, or are held feet upward and head downward - which can last for a long time, until their indignation has ceased.<p>A veil of this kind is introduced into the fantasy of those who, though they see the truth, yet - due to all kinds of reasons bursting from their loves - cannot manage to acknowledge it. But since they are constantly becoming displeased for those reasons, so much that they fight against the truth which they nevertheless see, such a veil is suited to their fantasy. And they tell me now that they are being tormented miserably by a longing to extricate themselves - a longing that is flaming up [within them]. 1747, the 31st day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 435</h4><p>435. With regard to the punishment by the veil, it is such that through the phantasies impressed upon them, they seem to themselves to be each under his own veil which is extended a great distance, it may be for miles. The veil is, as it were, a thin coherent cloud which becomes denser according to the governance of the phantasy. [Those under it] also excite themselves so that they run about hither and thither throughout its length and breadth, that they may burst forth from the veil, thus with diverse velocity and with diverse force, until at length, overcome with fatigue, they lie down, or are held with their feet upwards, and their head downwards. This may last a long time, even until their indignation has ceased. Such a veil is prepared in the phantasy of those who, although they see the truth, nevertheless of themselves cannot obtain it; there are many reasons within themselves, bursting forth from their loves, as they acknowledge, but from those reasons they are continually indignant, so that they fight against the truth which, however, they see. Such a veil corresponds to their phantasy. And they now tell me that they are miserably tormented by the desire of extricating themselves, which desire is inflamed. 1747, Dec. 31. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The entry in the Index (s.v. Velum) is: "Concerning a wide band in which some are enveloped and they can scarcely be unrolled for the band is still lengthened. Concerning the veil which is thrown over them, under which they run about desiring ardently to extricate themselves and burst forth, but in vain, from whom there is much trouble for those who remain in the external things of the Word and consequently do not want to be enlightened by interior things. Those also under the veil have their feet upwards and their head downwards." See also AC 963. </p>
