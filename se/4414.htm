<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4414</h4><p>4414. It is magical to want to make oneself good from an evil motive<p>To want to become good, indeed to make oneself good, when one is of good intent - this is good, when they do not know that it is from the Lord, for then they receive a heavenly self. But those who want to make themselves good on account of an evil purpose, of ruling over others, of destroying others, and so on, with these it is magical, the former being from heaven, the latter from hell.<p>One devoted to magic wanted to become good by his own power (Adlerheim), discovering this device, that he summoned certain good spirits to himself, and kept them around him, so that they would make him good. But this turned for him into a hell, for his purpose was by that means to commit evil, thus something still more magical, and he was then pressed down more toward the lower regions, out of which he was unable to lift himself. This shows that such a device is magical, about which I spoke with him, characterizing it as such. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4414</h4><p>4414. THAT IT IS MAGICAL TO WILL TO MAKE ONE'S SELF GOOD FROM AN EVIL END.<p>To will to become good, nay, to make one's self good, when good is intended, this is good, though it is not known that it is from the Lord; for thus there is received a celestial proprium. But those who wish to make themselves good for an evil end, as of ruling others, of destroying others, and so forth, to these it is magical; the former is from heaven, the latter from hell. A certain one given to magic willed to become good from himself (:Alderheim:); he hit upon the plan of drawing to himself certain good spirits, and of having them about himself, that they might make him good; but this was turned into hell to him, for his end was to do evil by that means, thus to do what was yet more magical. He was then depressed yet lower, [to a place] whence he could not elevate himself. Hence it is manifest that such a thing is magical; I spoke concerning it that such is its character. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4414 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4414. Quod magicum sit velle se facere bonum ex fine malo<p>Velle fieri bonus, imo se facere bonum, cum intendit bonum, hoc bonum est, cum ignorant quod a Domino, sic enim proprium coeleste accipiunt: at qui se bonos volunt facere ab finem malum, imperandi aliis, perdendi alios, et porro, iis est hoc magicum, illud ex coelo, hoc ex inferno: unus magicus voluit bonus fieri ex se Adlerheim) , invenit id, quod arcesseret ad se bonos quosdam, et haberet circum se, ut facerent eum bonum; sed versum hoc ei est in infernum, nam finis erat faciendi malum per illud, ita plus magicum; et depressus tunc versus inferiora magis, unde se elevare non potuit: inde patet quod tale sit magicum; loquutus de eo quod tale sit. </p>
