<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第402节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>402.有许多种类的灵人从遥远的外邦人那里通过他们的偶像而受到教育。一个灵魂从世上带来对他在世时所拜偶像的崇拜；因此，偶像崇拜者被引到他们活在肉身期间所崇敬的人那里，好叫他们能在那里被教导，逐渐摆脱他们的偶像崇拜。有一个种族聚集在它的酋长周围。我被告知，他们来自印度群岛，崇拜至高神。他们通过这种仪式来拜，当他们崇拜祂时，会以某种方式放大自己，紧接着出于他们曾经所持的观点，像小虫子一样俯伏在地。此外，以下观念被植入他们，即他们认为整个人类都在天堂里旋转，而在高处的伟大的神也跟随他们，注视着他们在做什么。因此，他们认为祂在场热心地注视着这个旋转的领域。祂的灵人们被如此教导，以致他们有可能给他们的贵胄带来一种呼吸。祂的灵人们也来到我这里，给我带来类似呼吸，好叫我能通过经历了解这一切。他们友善、顺服，行事简单朴素。他们的漩涡流动起来就像这类灵人的品性一样，很容易进行。后来，其他灵人来了，他们似乎更完美地执行了这个动作。（1747年12月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 402</h4><p>402. From peoples afar, many kinds of spirits are being educated by means of their idols<p>A soul brings along with him from the world the adoration of whatever idol he had worshipped in the world. Accordingly, souls are guided right to those whom they had venerated during the life of the body, so as to be instructed there and gradually put off their idolization.<p>There was one people gathered around their chief - I was told they were from the Indies - worshipping the greatest God. They did this by a ceremony in which, while they were adoring Him, they were magnifying themselves in a certain way, and then straightway prostrating themselves as little worms, due to a notion they had kept with them.<p>Moreover, it had been more or less instilled into them to visualize the whole human race as being whirled around in heaven, and the great God following along with them from above, watching what they were doing. So [they thought of Him as being] present, zealously watching over the whirling realm.<p>His spirits had been taught a way of bringing upon their magnate a kind of breathing. His spirits came also to me, and brought the same thing upon me so that I would know this from experience. They were kind, and obedient, and behaving with their simple candor. Their spiraling flow, characteristic of such spirits, proceeded with ease. Later, different ones arrived, who seemed to execute this [action] even more flawlessly. 1747, the 26th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 402</h4><p>402. THAT FROM THE DISTANT GENTILES MANY SPECIES OF SPIRITS ARE FORMED THROUGH THEIR IDOLS <p>A soul takes with him from the world the adoration of that idol which he has worshipped in the body; thus [idolaters] are led to those whom they have venerated in the life of the body, in order that they may there be initiated, and successively put off their idolatry. There was one race gathered around its primate. It was told me that they were from the Indies. They worshipped the Greatest God, and indeed with this rite, that when they adored Him, they then magnified themselves in a certain manner, and immediately afterwards, from the idea they had with themselves, prostrated themselves as little worms. Moreover, it was, as it were, implanted in them to regard the whole human race as circumgyrating in heaven, and the Great God on high following with them and watching what they were doing, thus as if He were present and brooded over the circumgyrated sphere. His spirits were so instructed that they might induce upon their Magnate a kind of respiration. His spirits also came to me and induced a like respiration upon me that I might know this from experience. They were modest and obedient, and were acting in their simplicity. Their vortical flow, like that of such spirits, proceeded easily. Afterwards others drew near who settled this in a manner as it were still more simply. 1747, Dec. 26. </p>

Quod ex gentibus longinquis plures species spirituum per eorum idola formentur<p>Anima secum a mundo trahit adorationem istius idoli quod in corpore coluit, ita etiam perducuntur ad eos quos venerati sunt in vita corporis, ut ibi initientur, et exuant successive idololatriam; una gens erat circum suum primatem collecta, mihi dictum quod ex Indiis essent, colebant maximum Deum, et quidem eo ritu, quod dum adorarent Ipsum, tunc se certo modo magnifaciebant, et mox inde se sicut vermiculos substraverunt, ex idea, quam habuerunt secum; praeterea iis erat quasi insitum spectare universum genus humanum in coelo circumgyratum, et magnum Deum sequentem superne secum et spectantem quid agerent, sic ut praesens esset <sup>1</sup></p><p>, qui sic incubuit sphaerae circumgyratae; spiritus ejus ita instructi erant, ut inducerent suo magnati speciem respirationis, ejus spiritus etiam ad me venerunt, et simile mihi inducebant, ut scirem id ab experientia, erant modesti, et obedientes, ac in simplicitate sua agentes; eorum fluxio vorticalis, qualis est talium spirituum, facile procedebat: postea alii advenerunt <sup>2</sup></p><p>, qui adhuc quasi purius id pangebant. 1747, die 26 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
