<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4199</h4><p>4199. But of these spirits there are many kinds, and many species, there being indeed also some who had loved the world, but who had not at the same time made the delight of their life to consist in the acquisition of its goods - these are not at once eager to return to it. There are also others who had loved the world, but are kept in a state of sleep until worldly delight has also fallen asleep, so that they have forgotten the world. These are simple spirits, and indeed, good ones. 1749, 3 April. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4199</h4><p>4199. Of these, however, there are numerous classes, generic and specific, as some who have loved the world have not, at the same time, made the delight of their life to consist in its good things; and these are not at once prompted to return to it. Others again have loved the world, but they are kept in a state of sleep until the principle of worldly delight is also laid asleep, and the world forgotten; these are the simple, and in some cases the good. - 1749, April 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4199 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4199. Sed horum sunt plura genera, et plures species, quidam quidem etiam qui amarunt mundum, sed non ita jucunditatem vitae sibi acquisiverunt in mundo, illi statim non volunt; alii sunt qui etiam amarunt mundum, sed tenentur in statu somni, usque dum jucundum mundi desopitum sit, ut obliti sint mundi, ii simplices sunt, et quidem boni. 1749, 3 April. </p>
