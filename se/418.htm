<p>418.许可：它们是如何通过自然界来表现的。天堂中的许可在自然界中是通过三重或四重大气来表现的，并且照着层级一层比另一层更纯净；在后的每一层都是由在先的那一层构成的，并且既从内，也从外直接作用于所构成的下一层大气；因此，在最后一层大气的每一个部分中都有存在于自己秩序中的在先的大气。当最后一层大气被暴风雨等恶劣天气扰乱时，先于它的那层大气便在它的最小部分，因而既在部分也在整体中从外从内非常平静地运行。先于这层大气的大气同样如此，而且运行更加平静；第一层大气的运行是最平静或平安的，因为它是随后所有大气层的全部中的全部，无论部分还是整体。在先的大气，尤其第一层大气以这种方式通过产生一种平静而作用于随后到来的大气，并通过这些随后的大气层而作用于最后一层大气，从而使最后的大气层恢复平衡，无论它由于风或暴风雨而变得多么混乱。天上的生命与可以说形成有暴风雨的最后一层大气的灵人之间也是如此。凡站在那里的人都会以为整个天堂会因暴风雨、雾气、乌云的出现而倾倒灭亡；然而，它们爆发之后，仍遵从弥赛亚神的命令和旨意而平安地被带回到安息之中。这些事是思想过的，但却是当着灵人的面写下来的。（1747年12月29日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 418</h4><p>418. How permissions are portrayed in nature<p>Permissions in Heaven are pictured in nature by the threefold or fourfold atmospheres, the one being a step purer than the other. Each subsequent one is composed from the one before, and acts upon the next composed atmosphere both from within and from without - so that in each single part of the last atmosphere, the prior ones are present in their order.<p>While the last atmosphere is troubled by harsh weather, the one immediately prior to it is working quite calmly both from without and from within in its least parts, thus in the part and in the whole. The atmosphere prior to that does likewise, still more calmly, and the first one most calmly or peacefully, it being the all in all of the following atmospheres both in their parts and in the whole. In this way, by producing a calm, a prior atmosphere, and especially, the first, acts upon the following atmospheres, and through these upon the last one, and restores equilibrium, however turbulent the last atmosphere may be from wind or storm.<p>So it is in the heavens between the heavenly beings, and the spirits who form as it were a last atmosphere, where there are storms. One standing there would think that the whole heaven was falling because of the appearing storms, downpours, black clouds; yet after their assault, they are peacefully brought back to rest in response to the nod and will of God the Messiah.<p>These things were thought, but written down in the presence of spirits. 1747, the 29th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 418</h4><p>418. PERMISSIONS: HOW THEY ARE REPRESENTED BY NATURE <p>Permissions in heaven are represented in nature by the threefold, or fourfold atmospheres, the one purer than the other according to degrees, the one that follows being compounded from the prior, which acts proximately upon the compound within and without; thus in each single part of the ultimate atmosphere, there are the prior atmospheres in their order. When the ultimate atmosphere is disturbed by a tempest, then the next prior atmosphere acts tranquilly enough, both without and within, in the single parts, thus in the part and in the whole; the atmosphere which is prior to that acts still more tranquilly; and the first, which is the all in all of the following atmospheres in the part and in the whole, acts most tranquilly or pacifically. Thus the prior, and especially the first atmosphere operates with tranquil action upon the following atmospheres, and by these upon the ultimate, and reduces that ultimate atmosphere to equilibrium, however tumultuous it may be owing to wind or tempest. So is it in the heavens among the heavenly lives and the spirits, who are, as it were, the ultimate atmosphere where there are tempests. Anyone who stands there supposes that the whole heaven will perish because the storms, mists, black clouds are clearly seen; but still after their outburst they are quietly reduced to rest in accordance with the behest and will of God Messiah. These things have been thought and written in the presence of spirits. 1747, Dec. 29. </p>

Permissiones quomodo per naturam repraesentantur<p>In natura repraesentantur permissiones in Coelo, per atmosphaeras triplices vel quadruplices, unam puriorem secundum gradus altera, sequentem compositam a priori, quae in proxime compositam agit intus et extra, ita in unaquavis parte atmosphaerae ultimae ordine sunt priores; dum ultima atmosphaera turbatur tempestate, tunc proxime prior tranquille satis agit, tam extus quam intus in singulo, sic in parte et in communi, prior adhuc atmosphaera adhuc tranquillius, et prima tranquillissime seu pacifice, quae est omnis in omnibus sequentibus in parte et communi, ita per tranquillum actum prior, et cumprimis prima atmosphaera agit in sequentes, et per has in ultimam, redigitque ad aequilibrium, utcunque tumultuat atmosphaera ultima vento seu tempestate, ita in coelis inter vitas coelestes, et spiritus, qui sunt quasi ultima atmosphaera, ubi tempestates: ibi qui stat, putat, quod totum coelum rueret, quia procellae, nimbi, nubes atrae conspiciuntur, sed usque post eorum excursum, pacifice rediguntur ad quietem, convenientem nutui ac voluntati Dei Messiae.
