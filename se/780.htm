<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 780</h4><p>780. To strive after any honor on earth or among people on earth, is not heavenly<p>I spoke with some who had died not so many years earlier, but were still among good spirits not yet let into heaven, who inwardly still desired honor in the world, or some kind of acclaim for their name among mortals on earth. I was also enabled to feel this their ambition. Then I spoke with them, and I said that this is something worldly still remaining, and that a heavenly attitude is to desire nothing of the kind, but rather to scorn it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 780</h4><p>780. TO SEEK AFTER ANY HONOR ON EARTH, OR AMONG MEN ON EARTH, IS NOT HEAVENLY <p>I spoke with some who died not so many years ago, who were still among good spirits, but not as yet admitted into heaven. They still interiorly desired honor in the world, or a name of some renown among mortals on earth, which cupidity I was also given to perceive with them. Therefore, I spoke with them saying, that this is something worldly that still remains, and that what is heavenly desires nothing of the kind, but rather regards it as vile. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 780 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>780. Affectare aliquem honorem in terra, seu inter homines terrae, non est coeleste<p>Loquutus sum cum iis, qui non ita ante tam multos annos mortui sunt, sed usque inter bonos spiritus, nondum admissi in coelum, qui adhuc interius cupiebant honorem in mundo, seu nominis quandam celebrationem, apud mortales in terra, quam cupidinem dabatur mihi apud eos quoque percipere, inde loquutus sum cum iis, quod hoc adhuc mundanum est quod remanet, et quod coeleste, nihil tale cupiat sed potius id vilipendat. </p>
