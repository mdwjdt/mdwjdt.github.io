<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5733</h4><p>5733. At the end, when the most part had been thrown down, it came to those leaders who were from [those who profess belief in] faith alone. Certain of these among them became black as devils, inside and out, so that they were no longer recognized as people but were wholly as the blackest devils, and as such were thrown into hell, although each according to their personal evil way of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5733</h4><p>5733. At length, when the great bulk were cast down, those leaders who were of faith alone were reached: wherefore, certain of them became black like devils, from within and also without; so that they could no longer be recognized as men, but wholly as the blackest devils, and so were cast into hells; everyone, nevertheless, according to his own evil of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5733 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5733. Tandem cum multa pars dejecta est, ventum est ad antesignanos illos qui e sola fide, quorum quidam inter illos facti sunt nigri sicut diaboli ab intus et extus, sic ut non amplius agnoscerentur pro hominibus, sed prorsus pro nigerrimis diabolis, et sic conjecti in inferna, quisque tamen secundum suum malum vitae. </p>
