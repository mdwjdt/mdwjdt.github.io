<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2379</h4><p>2379. I was also enabled to learn how it is when spirits are not close to a person, and yet there is an influence from certain societies. There was a certain general driving force that cannot be described, but it cannot appear to anyone, for it is miraculous. A person who is not in order, but against order, cannot exist unless there are spirits joined to him or her, and by means of them channels of communication with whatever societies agree with the person's life. For I have also been shown what sort of societies had been joined to people in the other life, similar to themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2379</h4><p>2379. It was also given me to know how it is when there are societies. There was a sort of common acting principle which cannot be expressed. But such cannot exist with everyone, for it is miraculous. Man who is not in order, but contrary to order, cannot be without spirits adjoined to himself and through them, by communications with such societies as agree with his life; for in the other life it is also shown what sort of societies had been adjoined to man, which were similar to him. </p>

Dabatur mihi quoque scire, quomodo se habet, cum spiritus non sint prope hominem, sed usque quod influxus sit a quibusdam societatibus, erat commune quoddam agens, quod non exprimi potest; sed tale existere non potest cuiquam, nam miraculosum est, homo qui non est in ordine, sed contra ordinem, non potest esse absque spiritibus <sup>1</sup></p><p>sibi adjunctis, et per eos, communicationibus cum talibus societatibus, quae conveniunt ejus vitae, nam quales societates homini adjunctae fuerint, ei similes, in altera vita quoque ostensum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has spiritus </p>
