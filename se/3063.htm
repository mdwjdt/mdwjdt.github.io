<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3063</h4><p>3063. The reason why spirits are carried on high, and downwards<p>Sometimes spirits are carried on high, and then instantaneously down deep, which surprised them. The reason, which I have just heard, is only a changing of the societies that are attached to them through the fantasies of others, and as soon as these withdraw, [the spirits] fall back into the former society.<p>The fantasy of one spirit together with his companions sometimes drives another forcibly on high or down deep, yet this is only an appearance; but when their fantasy is attached to the other, then there is a transfer according to the fantasy. 1748, 5 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3063</h4><p>3063. THE REASON WHY SPIRITS ARE BORNE [CARRIED] ALOFT, AND [THEN] DOWNWARDS. <p>The reason why spirits are borne aloft, and [then] in a moment to a great depth, whereat they marveled, is as I have now heard, that there is merely a change of societies adjoined by the phantasies of others, who, as soon as they desist, fall back into [their] former society. Sometimes the phantasy of one, together with his associates, forcibly puts another aloft or below [profundum]: but this is only an appearance: but when their phantasy adjoins them, then the translation is according to the phantasy. - 1748 September 5. </p>
