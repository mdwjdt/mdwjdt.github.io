<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第581节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>581.当我读约翰福音17章时，一些来自木星的灵人和我在一起，他们听见了。令他们惊讶的是，独一主变成了一个人，并且和其他人一样在地球上。但后来他们说，他们所听到的一切都是神性。我们地球上一些系不信者的灵人不断暗示祂是一个人，被钉在十字架上，并且祂生来就是一个人，和其他人一样等等。木星灵听了这话，什么也没说。然而，后来他们声称，这些灵人完全就是魔鬼，因为他们从世俗、肉体和类似事物的角度吸取他们所说的话，而木星灵自己则把这些事物当作渣滓而加以弃绝，视它们为虚无；这些地球灵想出于这类事物、因而出于渣滓说话，而这些渣滓会将心智变瞎，使黑暗笼罩真理之光。现在他们告诫我们地球灵，他们只要留在这些瓦砾中，由此形成他们的论据和判断，就和他们自己（木星灵）的魔鬼没什么两样，他们将这些魔鬼从所有社群中驱逐出来，扔在脚下，吐出去如同吐在淤泥里。木星灵从以下事实也能判断出他们邪恶的秉性，即：我们地球灵从所听到关于他们的一切信息当中，只想象他们的赤身裸体；至于其它的事，也就是天上的事，他们甚至连想都不想；他们由此得出结论说，他们里面几乎没有什么天上的东西。（1748年1月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 581</h4><p>581. There were some spirits from that earth who listened as I was reading Chapter 17 of John. They were surprised that the One Only Lord had become a human being, and had been on earth like another human being, but still they said afterwards that all things [they heard] are Divine. Spirits of our earth, who were disbelievers, were constantly interjecting that He was human, that He was crucified, that He was born human, and was like any other human being.<p>They listened to these remarks without saying anything. Later, however, they declared that these spirits were altogether devils, because they take the things they are saying from what is worldly, bodily, and the like, which they on their earth reject as waste and consider as nothing. On such refuse these spirits like to base their speaking, which blinds minds and casts darkness over the light of truth.<p>And now they are warning the spirits of our earth that so long as they stay in such rubble, and develop their arguments therefrom, or judge therefrom, they are no different from their own devils, whom they completely reject from society, casting and spewing them out beneath their feet, or into the mud.<p>The spirits of Jupiter could also judge their evil character from the fact that of all that the spirits of our earth had heard about them, they entertained in fantasy nothing else but the fact of their nakedness. Other matters, which are heavenly, they do not even think about, which leads to the conclusion that there is almost nothing heavenly in them. 1748, 26 January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 581</h4><p>581. There were certain spirits from that earth [with me] when I was reading John xvii, and they heard it. They wondered that the One Only Lord became a Man, and had been upon earth as any other man. But still, they later said that all things are Divine. Spirits of our earth who were infidels continually suggested that He was a man, that He was crucified, that He was born a man, and like another man, and similar things. The spirits of Jupiter heard this without saying anything. Afterwards, however, they said that such spirits are altogether devils, taking what they say from the things that are mundane, corporeal, and the like, which they themselves reject as dross, and esteem as nothing; they want to speak from such things, thus from dross, which blinds the mind and casts darkness over the light of truth. They now admonish the spirits of our earth that as long as they remain in such things and from them form their arguments and judge, they are no different from their devils whom they cast out from all consociation; they cast them beneath their feet and spit them out as into the mire. They could also judge their evil genius from this, that in their phantasy our spirits dwelt upon nothing else concerning them, than their nakedness; the other things which they had heard concerning them, which are heavenly, they do not even think about; hence they conclude that there is almost nothing heavenly in them. 1748, Jan. 26. </p>
