<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2244</h4><p>2244. Some spirit said that when in their company, he would tell them all kinds of clever sayings, and produce fantasies that delighted them, because he was even able to bring forth visions in front of them to entertain them. But still, he said, he would afterwards hurt them, twisting the visions into evil, one of which they portrayed to me. So while they certainly wanted to have him among them, yet because he was like that, they could not bear it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2244</h4><p>2244. A certain spirit said that he was such a one in their company as dictates very many ingenious things, and produces phantasies, which would delight them, because he was also able to produce visions in their presence to amuse them, but yet would afterwards hurt them, and these would be turned [torquerentur] into evil. A certain vision was also represented by them to me; wherefore they were willing indeed to have him amongst themselves, but as he was of such a character, they could not endure [him]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2244 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2244. Quidam spiritus dicebat, quod is in eorum consortio talis esset, ut iis perplura ingeniosa dictet, et phantasias producat, quae eos delectarent, quia producere quoque potuit visiones coram iis, quibus oblectaret <sup>1</sup></p><p>, sed usque quod postea eos laederet, et in malum torquerentur, quaedam visio ab iis mihi quoque est repraesentata, quare eum quidem inter se habere volebant, sed quia talis non potuerunt sufferre.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
