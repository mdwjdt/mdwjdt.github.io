<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 727</h4><p>727. Presently others appeared, three in a row, among whom there was even one woman. They were cunningly awaiting the opportunity to steal something. One, at the left, secretly looking for my purse, wanted to slip his hand into it. Another, facing me, was cunningly saying he did not want to take away anything, yet his craftiness was apparent from his speech. His looks were not unattractive, nor were the woman's. Whether she had been sent out as a decoy, I do not know for sure.<p>Someone also appeared who was taking away boxes as though he were carrying off plunder. 1748, 11 February. </p>

Mox alii apparuerunt, ordine tres, inter eos etiam una faemina, qui insidiati sunt subdole, si quid possent latrocinari, unus a sinistra clandestine, qui crumenam meam quaerens <sup>1</sup></p><p>, immittere clam voluit manum, alter ante faciem subdole, dicens, quod nihil vellet auferre, insidiatio ex sermone usque elucebat, erat facie non invenusta, sicut nec mulier, num haec emissa insidiationis causa, non pro certo scio. Quidam etiam apparuit, qui cistas auferebat, sicut spolia, quae auferret. 1748, 11 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
