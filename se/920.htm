<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 920</h4><p>920. Those who relate to bones, on which vital motions come to rest as on their fulcrums<p>There are some in bodily life, or after bodily life in the other life as well, who, for special reasons, think only in a general manner, or do not keep their thought directed toward anything definite. Thus they are withdrawn, as if they were not in the body.<p>Spirits of this kind brought to me a similar general mental image, without objects to which the thought might be directed. Such are those who relate to bones in man. They are also slow and dull-witted, nor can anything become fixed in their memory, nor, consequently, drawn forth from it, except in a focussed state.<p>There is in them not only a sluggishness in performing their functions, but also an inertia in coming to judgment and action - yet no disquietude. For worries do not really penetrate [to them], but disperse so to speak into a generality, and pass away. And they are not malicious. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 920</h4><p>920. THOSE WHO RELATE TO THE BONES IN WHICH THE VITAL MOTIONS TERMINATE AS IN THEIR FULCRA <p>There are some in the life of the body, and also in the other life after the life of the body, who, from causes in themselves, think only in a general manner, or do not have their thought determined to any definite thing; thus they are as distracted as though they were not in the body. Such spirits have induced upon me a similar general idea, without any objects to which the thought might be determined. Such are those who relate to the bones in man. They are also slow and dull-witted nor can anything be fixed in their memory except in a determinate state, consequently neither can anything be brought forth therefrom. 1748, Feb. 21. <p>There is with them not only a sluggishness in their employments, but also a dullness in judging and acting. Still, there is nothing intranquil; for cares do not penetrate, being dissipated as it were into a general idea and perishing. They are not malicious. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 920 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>920. Qui ossa referunt, in quae vitales motus ut in sua hypomochlia terminantur<p>Sunt quidam in vita corporis, aut etiam post vitam corporis in altera vita, ex causis suis, communiter solum cogitantes, seu [qui] non habent cogitationem determinatam ad quoddam certum, ita usque distracti, sicut non in corpore, tales mihi similem induxerunt ideam communem, absque objectis, in quae cogitatio determinata esset, tales sunt, qui <sup>1</sup></p><p>ossa in homine referunt, sunt quoque lenti, ac ingenii hebetis, nec nisi quam in statu determinato aliquid eorum memoriae infigi potest, proinde nec ab ea depromi. 1748, 21 Febr.<p>Est penes eos non solum tarditas in eorum muneribus sed etiam torpor in judicandis, agendisque, usque non intranquillum, quia curae non ita penetrant, quasi dissipantur in communem ideam, et pereunt <sup>2</sup></p><p>; nec sunt malitiosi.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quae<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has perit </p>
