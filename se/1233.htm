<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1233</h4><p>1233. Certain spirits of the urinary group were trying to harass them there, but were unable to get into that place. Just by coming to the edge of that region, they spread out like a little, fine cloud that moved around the region, at the right side from my viewpoint. This fine cloud curled around, finally [moving] upwards in a spiral or helical form, and withdrew. Meanwhile those spirits began wailing that they had been carried along winding paths and did not know where they were going. Those in that place are safe, and are not permitted to be harassed by that bodily and material judgment [see <a href="1206.htm">1206</a>]. 1748, 8 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1233</h4><p>1233. Some spirits of the urinary group desired to worry them there, but they could not enter that place. As soon as they approached the boundary of that region they were expanded like a small thin cloud which [extended] itself round about that region, on the right side in respect to me. This thin cloud at length coiled itself into the forth of a spiral or helix, thus upwards, and so it departed. In the meanwhile, the spirits began to lament that they were being carried away by winding paths, and did not know where they were going. Therefore the spirits in that place are safe, nor are they permitted to be harassed by that corporeal and material judgment. 1748, Mar. 8. </p>

Quidam spiritus cupiebant eos ibi lacessere, ex familia urinatoriorum, sed non potuerunt in locum illum intrare, modo cum ad peripheriam istius regionis veniebant, expandebantur sicut tenuis nubecula, quae se circum eam regionem a parte dextra, respectu mei [movebat,] <sup>1</sup></p><p>quae nubes tenuis se sinuabat, et tandem in spiralis seu helicis formam, et sic sursum, ac recessit <sup>2</sup></p><p>, interea spiritus incipiebant lamentari, quod per ambages lati, nescirent quo vaderent: quare ii in loco isto tuti sunt, nec a judicio isto corporeo et materiali lacessi permittuntur. 1748, 8 <sup>3</sup></p><p>Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
