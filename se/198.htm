<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第198节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>198.所有灵人和世人都被束缚。我经常发现，所有灵人都被束缚，也就是受到各种约束，免得他们冲进各种欲望和激情，没有哪两种灵人所受的束缚是一样的。只要得到允许，他们就会冲进各种欲望和激情，若非被弥赛亚神保持在适当的约束中，简直无以复加。天使也一样，因为他们每一个都和世人一样，从根上就是邪恶的。今天我还发现，一个灵人当其束缚被松开时，便飞到高处，还想飞得更高；如果他被允许随心所欲地往前飞，我毫不怀疑他会爆炸，或化为乌有。因为灵人和世人一样，若被允许照其欲望的冲动爆发，就不会停止其贪欲的热情，直到他爆炸。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 198</h4><p>198. All spirits and people on earth are held in bonds<p>Something I have very often noticed was that all spirits were held in bonds, that is, in the kinds of restraints that withheld them from breaking out into lusts and passions - each species of spirits in a bond different from that of another. And to the extent that they are given the liberty, they rush into lusts and passions beyond measure, unless held in suitable restraints by God the Messiah. Likewise also the angels, for each one of them, like people on earth, is evil to the core.<p>Today I also found out that one spirit, when his bond was loosened, flew up on high, and wanted to go still higher, and if he had been allowed to fly forth in pursuit of his lust, I do not doubt but that he would have burst, or else fallen to nothing. For a spirit, like a person in the world, if given the liberty to break away and follow the impulse of his lust, does not abstain from the ardor of his passion until he bursts. 1747, the 5th day of September (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 198</h4><p>198. THAT ALL SPIRITS AND MEN ARE HELD IN BONDS <p>What I have frequently observed is that all spirits are held in bonds, namely, in such bonds as restrain them from bursting forth into lusts and cupidities, the bonds of one species of spirits being different from those of another; and so far as they are allowed they rush headlong, and unless they were held in suitable bonds by God Messiah it would be beyond measure. The angels would also do likewise, for every one of them like man, is radically evil. Today I also found that one spirit, when his bond was relaxed, flew on high and desired to go higher still, and if he had been allowed to fly according to his inclination, I have no doubt that he would have burst or fallen to nothing; for if license be granted a spirit to burst forth according to the impetuosity of his lust, he, like man, does not desist from the heat of his cupidity until he is broken. 1747, Sept. 5, o.s. </p>
