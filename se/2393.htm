<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2393</h4><p>2393. Why spirits do not show themselves to people and teach people about the existence and nature of spirits<p>There are very many reasons residing in the secret sanctuary of the Lord why such things do not take place. I am permitted to tell only that they cannot be shown to people who have not higher knowledge of true faith, because when they do, the Lord can be present and take care that spirits, who flit around in gangs and armies, wanting nothing else than to corrupt, even to kill humankind, do not bring harm upon their body and soul. For when it is granted them to show themselves, they then also work themselves perceptibly into people's mental images and their will. It is different with those who have higher knowledge of true faith, for then the Lord takes care that they do not bring such harm on them.<p>Besides, to show spirits and souls of the dead to the eyes of a person on earth and thereby urge them to believe, is also contrary to the wisdom of the Lord, Who does not break anyone, but bends [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_3.htm">Is. 42:3</a>]. 1748, 23 June: these words were written in the presence of spirits, and of angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2393</h4><p>2393. WHY SPIRITS DO NOT MANIFEST THEMSELVES BEFORE MEN, AND INSTRUCT MEN CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE AND QUALITY OF SPIRITS. <p>There are very many causes which are in the Lord's secret and sanctuary, why such things do not exist. It is permitted to relate only that they cannot be manifested to a man who is not in the knowledges of true faith, because the Lord can thus be present, and take care that spirits, inasmuch as they fly around in troops and squadrons, and desire nothing else than to pervert man, yea, kill him, may not bring harm to man, as regards his body and soul; for when it is allowed them to manifest themselves, then they also operate to the manifest sense, upon the ideas and will of man. It is different with those who are in the knowledges of true faith. The Lord then takes care that such things may not be brought on man. Moreover, to raise spirits and souls of the dead before the eyes of man, and thus urge him to believe, this also is contrary to the Lord's wisdom, who does not break man but bends him. These things in the presence of spirits and angels. - 1748, June 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2393 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2393. Cur non spiritus se manifestent coram hominibus, et de existentia et qualitate spirituum homines instruant<p>Sunt perplures causae, quae in arcano et sanctuario Domini, quod talia non existant, memorare licet solum, quod manifestari nequeant homini, qui non est in cognitionibus verae fidei, quia sic adesse potest Dominus, et praecavere ne spiritus, quia turmatim <sup>1</sup></p><p>et agminatim circumvolitant, et nihil aliud cupiunt quam hominem pervertere, imo interficere, homini damnum inferant quoad corpus et animam, dum enim iis conceditur se manifestare, tunc quoque operantur ad manifestum sensum in ideas, et voluntatem hominis; aliter qui in cognitionibus verae fidei sunt, tunc Dominus praecavet ne talia inferantur homini. Praeterea, spiritus et animas mortuorum oculis hominis sistere, et sic urgere ad credendum, hoc quoque repugnat sapientiae Domini, Qui non frangit hominem, sed flectit eum, 1748, 23 Junius: haec in praesentia spirituum, et angelorum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
