<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2463</h4><p>2463. Certain ones from the families of spirits were thinking about the things written just now [<a href="2462.htm">2462</a>], that is that the [very inward and innermost parts] are incomprehensible and ineffable, and thus that it cannot be seen except from outer effects that they originate from things cohering in most beautiful connection and following along in a wonderful order - as can be seen from the outer human parts, also from actions, in that the tissues are arranged in a most beautiful order due to which an action composed of so many elements can come forth.<p>So I was prompted to respond to them that they cannot reason about the matter at all as to whether it is so or not, unless they have seen these regions and been in them - yes, and think from them - just as one cannot see how so countlessly many muscles and tissues are connected that present one action composed of thousands of elements, nor can one know how a person can live in the body without having examined and become acquainted with the muscles, internal organs, and many other inward parts of the body. The case is no different here, if one wants to reason whether these matters are so from outer things when one has never seen inner ones, or known that inner ones exist, much less what they are like. 1748, 30 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2463</h4><p>2463. Certain of the families of spirits thought about those things which are now written respecting incomprehensible and ineffable things, as that it cannot be seen save from externals and effects, that from such arise those which cohere in most beautiful connection and follow in order. For example [it may appear] from those things which are the externals of man, and from [his] actions that the fibers are thus disposed in most beautiful order, from so many of which an action is composed and can exist of such a sort; wherefore it was given to reply to them, that they may by no means reason concerning it whether it is so or not, unless they should see these things and be therein, yea, think therefrom: like as man cannot see how so innumerable muscles and fibers are connected, as present an action composed from a thousand things, nor can he know how a man can live in the body unless he has first inspected and become acquainted with the muscles, viscera, and many things of the interiors of the body. The case is not different as regards the wishing to reason from externals whether [more interior and inmost things] are so, when he has never seen internals, or known that there are internals, still less what their quality is. - 1748, June 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2463 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2463. Quidam ex spirituum familiis cogitabant de iis quae scripta nunc sunt [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2463/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2462" target=_top>2462</a>], quod incomprehensibilia ineffabilia, sic quod non nisi ab externis effectibus videri possit, quod ex talibus oriantur, quae pulcherrimo nexu cohaerent mirabili ordine consequuntur, sicut ab iis quae externa sunt hominis, etiam ex actionibus, quod fibrae sint ordine pulcherrimo ita dispositae, ex quibus actio ex tam multis composita existere talis possit: quare eis respondere dabatur, quod neutiquam possint ratiocinari de eo, num ita sit vel non, nisi ea viderint, inque iis fuerint, imo ex iis cogitent, sicut nec homo videre possit, quomodo musculi fibrae tam innumerae connexae sint, quae sistunt actionem a millibus compositam, nec scire possst, quomodo corpore vivere possit homo, nisi prius inspexerit notum sibi fecerit musculos, viscera plura interiorum corporis, aliter non hic se habet velle ratiocinari num ita se habeant, ab externis, cum nusquam interna viderit, aut noverit quod interna sint, minus qualia sint. 1748, 30 Junius. </p>
