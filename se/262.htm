<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第262节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>262.第三层天堂有一些宁静的气场，它们要被称为无知的气场。今天早晨，我被引入一些所谓的第三层天堂的气场，事实上被引入它的至内层。因为每层天堂都有其至内层、内层和外层。刚从坑里出来的灵人被告知，他们要在那里逗留一阵子。那里有宁静，根本感觉不到任何悲伤；所以这里有宁静，这宁静在内在层级上对应于至内在区域的平安。后来，在像圆柱一样的某种东西包围下，我被引入可以说内层天堂的其它气场，以及无知的天堂（每层天堂都分为它自己的众天堂）；那里听不见任何声音，很宁静。这些就是弥赛亚神所说的住处（约翰福音14:2），它们在此被称为气场。最后，我被引入另一个无知的天堂；该天堂是由那些对异端邪说毫不关心的人组成的，他们既不肯定，也不否认任何东西，声称每个人都珍视自己的观点。然而，这里并不那么平静。这就像是有人想要用斧头打碎一堵墙，而每个人都说他害怕那人最后闯进来袭击他。这些天堂被分开，严加看管；因此，在众天堂，没有什么东西是杂乱无章的，除非照着低层天堂的表象来看。低层天堂不再被称为内层天堂，而是被称为低层天堂。那里住着一群在地狱之上行为放荡的灵人（1747年11月21日）。内层天堂中的无知天堂对应于更内层和至内层天堂中的纯真。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 262</h4><p>262. There are realms of calmness, which are to be called auras of ignorance, in the third heaven<p>This morning I was guided into several realms, so to speak, of the third heaven, <sup>1</sup>and in fact to its innermost region (for each heaven has its innermost, very inward, and inward parts) where spirits were said to sojourn who are recently delivered from the pit. There was calmness, and nothing sad was noticeable; so that here is the calmness that in the inward degree corresponds to peace in the innermost regions </p><p>[41]. Afterwards, surrounded by something like a column, I was guided into other auras, so to speak, of the inward Heaven, and indeed, to the heaven of ignorance (every heaven is distinguishable into its heavens), where not a sound was heard, but it was calm.<p>mThese are the habitations or mansions about which God the Messiah [spoke] [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_2.htm">John 14:2</a>], which are here called auras.n <sup>2</sup><p>Finally [I was conducted] to another heaven of ignorance, consisting of the kind of people who are unconcerned about heresies, and who neither affirm nor deny anything, saying that every person fosters his own opinion. Yet here it was not so calm. It was as if someone wanted to smash the wall with an axe, and someone said that he feared that person might finally strike him.<p>These heavens are separate, and well guarded, so nothing in the heavens is disarranged, except as to appearance in the inward heaven - which is no longer to be called the inward, but the lower heaven. <sup>3</sup>There abides a gang of lower spirits above hell who carry on licentiously. 1747, the 21st day of November (old calendar). - Obs. The heaven of ignorance in the inward heaven interacts with that of Innocence in the very inward and innermost heavens. <sup>4</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. in descending order.<br><br>2.&nbsp;The Latin word is "sphaerae."<br><br>3.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the author continues to call it the inward heaven for some time.<br><br>4.&nbsp;This sentence is emphasized by the words "Obs. Obs." written in the margin. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 262</h4><p>262. THAT THERE ARE TRANQUIL SPHERES IN THE THIRD HEAVEN WHICH ARE TO BE CALLED SPHERES OF IGNORANCE <p>This morning I was led into some so-called spheres of the third heaven, and indeed to its inmost, for each heaven has its inmost, its more interior, and its exterior. The spirits who were recently taken out of the pit were told to tarry there for a little time. There was tranquillity there, nor was anything at all sad perceived; wherefore here is the tranquillity which, in the interior degree, corresponds to peace in the inmost. Afterwards having been encompassed as if with [an angelic] column, I was led into other spheres as it were of the interior heaven, and also into the heaven of ignorance. (Each heaven can be distinguished into its own heavens.) Nothing whatever was heard there, but it was tranquil. At length I was led into another heaven of ignorance, consisting of such as cared nothing about heresies, and who neither affirm nor, deny anything whatever, saying that everyone cherishes his own opinion. There, however, it was not so tranquil. It was as if someone wanted to break down the wall with an axe, of whom everyone said he was afraid lest he should at length break in. These heavens are separate and well guarded: thus nothing in the heavens is indistinct, except according to the appearance in the lower heaven, which is no longer to be called the interior, but the lower, heaven, where there is a crowd of lower spirits above hell, who act licentiously. 1747, Nov. 21, o.s. <p>The heaven of ignorance in the interior heaven, corresponds to Innocence in the more interior and inmost. <sup>1</sup><p>mThese are the habitations or mansions of heaven, of which God Messiah speaks (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_2.htm">John 14:2</a>), which are here called spheres.n <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the margin: "obs. obs." </p>
