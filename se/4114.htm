<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4114</h4><p>4114. About the most ancient Church<p>I was shown a flaming light above the forehead, and spirits from the most ancient Church spoke with me, saying that there is such a light, in which they are, and that it is much more intense. 1748, 7 Dec.<p>About both lives of a spirit </p><p>[2] With a spirit there are two lives that he has carried with him from the body which remain, since it is not granted to him to use the bodily memory, namely the life of convictions and the life of passions. As for the life of convictions, I was surprised that spirits are able to converse among themselves as they do, and to confirm whatever they are thinking and saying by so many reasons or reasonings that no one on earth could believe it. For they bring in so many, and such varied supporting arguments that they have ready, that I have very often been surprised. I was instructed that those confirmations so varied and diverse which they have ready and in their presence, so to speak, come from their life of convictions; for when a spirit is in a state of conviction, then he at once arouses out of man's memory confirmations that are there - for conviction on a matter arouses, as everyone well knows, and hence their conversations are so rich with multitudes of confirmations.</p><p>[3] But with people in whom the way is not opened for them to be able to speak with spirits, it is a different matter, for to them such spirits are attached who are of about the same conviction. For if two opposite convictions were present, they would not agree. It is different with me so that I may learn what the spirits are like. When people change their conviction, then other spirits are attached to them, so that whatever the person's conviction is, such is the spirit's conviction, and the spirit is constantly arousing confirmatory arguments. And, moreover, a spirit with a person is led away into the person's conviction and adopts it, as I have also experienced.<p>The life of passions is a distinct one, but when a passion puts on a conviction, then both lives act [at the same time].<p>Therefore it is good that a person does not become convinced of falsities, but is confirmed in truths, for it is not easy to be led away from a conviction once it is assumed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4114</h4><p>4114. CONCERNING THE MOST ANCIENT CHURCH.<p>There was exhibited to me a flamy light above the forehead, and those of the Most Ancient Church spoke with me, saying, that they have such a light, and much more intense, in which they dwell. - 1748, December 7.<p>4114. 1-2. CONCERNING EACH KIND OF LIFE OF A SPIRIT.<p>There are with a spirit two lives which he takes with him from the body, and which remain, as it is not given him to use the corporeal memory; namely, the life of persuasion and the life of cupidities. As respects the life of persuasions, I wondered that spirits could converse with each other, as they do, and that whatever they think and speak they are able to confirm by so many reasons or reasonings as a man could scarcely believe; for they adduce so many and so various confirmations, which they have at hand, that I have often been filled with wonder [at witnessing it]. I was given to understand, that confirmations so various and manifold, which are ever in readiness and, as it were, present to them, are from the life of persuasions; for when a spirit is in persuasion, he immediately excites or suggests confirmations from a man's memory, that is from the things stored up in his memory; for the persuasion of a thing excites, as anyone may be aware [who reflects]. Hence proceed their discourses replete with such multiplied confirmations.<p>But with men whose interiors are not opened so that one can speak with spirits, the case is different; for to him such spirits apply themselves as are of a nearly similar persuasion; for if two contrary persuasions were present, there would be a discord. With me it is otherwise, in order that I may know the qualities of spirits. When a man changes his persuasions then other spirits apply themselves to him; wherefore, whatever be the man's persuasion, such is the persuasion of the spirit, and the spirit continually excites confirmations. Moreover the spirit that is with a man is led into his persuasion, and adopts a similar, as I have learnt by experience.<p>The life of cupidities is distinct from this, but wherever cupidity has induced a persuasion, then each life acts. Wherefore it is good for a man not to be persuaded concerning falsities, but to be confirmed in truths; for he is not easily brought to renounce a pre-assumed persuasion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4114 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4114. De antiquissima Ecclesia<p>Ostensa est mihi lux flammea supra frontem, et loquuti mecum ab antiquissima Ecclesia, dicentes, quod talis iis lux, et multo intensior, in qua sunt. 1748, 7 Dec.<p>[2] De utraque vita spiritus<p>Apud spiritum sunt binae vitae, quas secum a corpore traxit, quae manent cum nulla ei corporea memoria uti datur, nempe vita persuasionum et vita cupiditatum; quod vitam persuasionum attinet, miratus sum, quod spiritus ita inter se loqui possint, et quodcunque cogitant et loquuntur, confirmare tot rationibus, aut ratiociniis, ut nemo hominum id possit credere, nam tot confirmantia adducunt et tam varia, quae iis in promptu sunt, ut saepius miratus sim; instructus, quod confirmantia tam varia et diversa, quae in promptu sunt, et quasi in praesenti, sint ex vita persuasionum; dum enim in persuasione est spiritus, tunc excitat illico e memoria hominis confirmantia, quae in hominis memoria sunt, nam persuasio rei excitat, ut cuivis etiam notum esse potest, inde eorum colloquia tam multiplicibus confirmantibus referta.<p>[3] At apud homines, quibus non apertum est ut loqui possit cum spiritibus, est alia res, nam ei applicantur tales spiritus qui similis fere persuasionis sunt, nam si binae persuasiones adessent contrariae, non concordarent; aliter apud me, ut scirem quales spiritus sunt: homo dum mutat persuasionis, tunc alii spiritus ei applicantur: quare qualis est persuasio hominis, talis est persuasio spiritus, spiritus excitat continuo confirmantia: et praeterea, spiritus apud hominem abducitur in ejus persuasionem, et induit similem, quod etiam expertus sum. Vita cupiditatum est distincta, at quando cupiditas induxit persuasionem, tunc utraque vita agit. Quare bonum est homini ut non persuadeatur de falsis; sed confirmetur in veris; nam a persuasione capta non facile abducitur. </p>
