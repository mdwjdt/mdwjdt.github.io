<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1195</h4><p>1195. About a Rabbi appearing<p>Some dim spirit appeared, or rather, some dim thing, because it was coming from that region such as the filthy city of Jerusalem, near Gehenna, spoken of earlier [745-754, 843-855]. A sort of gate was opened, and he approached in the light of a starry night, and as he entered by the opened gate, there were wandering stars there, rather dim ones, flying around him, especially on his left.<p>As he came towards me, I did not take him to be a spirit, but a dark cloud. He approached ever closer and came right up to my left ear, from above, which he touched with his mouth, to speak with me. He did not speak out loud, but as if within himself. Still, I heard him quite clearly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1195</h4><p>1195. CONCERNING A RABBI WHO APPEARED <p>A certain obscure one appeared, or rather some obscure thing, because it was coming from that region where is the filthy city Jerusalem, in the neighborhood of Gehenna, concerning which see above [nos. <a href="../se/636.htm">636</a>, <a href="../se/750.htm">750</a>, <a href="../se/843.htm">843</a>. But a gate was as it were opened, and he came in the shade of night or in star-light, and when the gate had been opened, he entered. In that place there were rather obscure wandering stars, and they flew around him especially on his left. As he approached me I did not suppose that he was a spirit, but rather a dark cloud; still he drew nearer and applied himself from above to my left ear which he touched with his mouth, so that he might speak with me. He did not speak with a sonorous voice, but as if inwardly within himself; still I heard him plainly enough. </p>

De Rabbino qui apparuit<p>Apparuit quidam obscurus, seu potius aliquod obscurum, quia ex regione ista veniebat, ut urbe Hierosolyma coenosa, circa Gehennam, de qua prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1195/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_745" target=_top>745-754</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1195/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_843" target=_top>843-855</a>], sed aperiebatur tanquam porta, ac veniebat in luce nocturna seu stellifera, cumque aperta porta, intraret, errantes stellae sed obscuriores in eo erant, et volabant circum eum a sinistro ejus imprimis; hic accedens ad me, non <sup>1</sup></p><p>autumabam, quod aliquis spiritus esset, sed tenebrosa nubes, sed usque accessit propius, seque adplicuit sinistrae meae auri, superne, quam tangebat ore, ut mecum loqueretur, sed non loquutus est voce sonora, sed quasi intus in se, usque tamen eum audiebam, satis manifeste.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
