<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1951</h4><p>1951. Such people, moreover, in spite of being most skilled in languages such as Hebrew, nevertheless have hallucinated, and do hallucinate much more in their translation of holy scripture than translators who had not been critics, even if they had less understanding of grammar. This could be proven in many instances, even though a contrary opinion has a firm hold on human minds. 1748, 13 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1951</h4><p>1951. Such, also, although they are most skilful in languages, as in the Hebrew, have, nevertheless, much more blundered [hallucinati sunt], and do still blunder, in translating the Holy Scripture, than those who have not been critics, although they may have less understood grammatical [points]; which can be demonstrated by very many considerations, although [I am aware] that in human minds there is a settled opinion to the contrary. <sup>1</sup>- 1748, May 13. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Mr. Smithson, from whose translation we copy Nos. 1950-1955, here inserts the following note: "From these observations of the author, it must not be supposed that a thorough grammatical and philological knowledge of the Hebrew and of other languages is to be disregarded or lightly esteemed, because accuracy and certainty can only be obtained by such means. But the author's observations relate to those who make that which is formal and secondary essential and primary, or who make intelligence and wisdom consist in such things as are but the lowest means of acquiring them." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1951 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1951. Tales quoque, licet in linguis peritissimi, sicut in Hebraea, usque tamen multo magis hallucinati sunt, et hallucinantur in translatione scripturae sanctae, quam qui non critici fuerunt, tametsi minus intellexerint grammaticalia, quod perplurimis demonstrari potest, tametsi alia opinio insedit mentibus humanis. 1748, 13 Maj. </p>
