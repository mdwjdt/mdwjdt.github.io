<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>427.出于一种特殊的怜悯，有些人通过深度睡眠，以及睡眠中滋生的梦境而做好准备。还有一个灵人不停地说“我沉默”、“我说话”这一句话，并且说得相当频繁。我问他这话是什么意思，他没有给出其它回答。不过，我从别人那里听说，他已经被送入睡眠状态；我被指教，有些人被送入这种睡眠状态，通过梦境，或许还通过短暂的清醒而经历洁净，直到他们摆脱从世上所带来的幻象。（1747年12月30日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 427</h4><p>427. Some, due to a special mercy, are prepared by means of deep sleep, and in the sleep by troubling dreams<p>There was also one who kept on saying only, "I am silent," and "I am speaking," and this quite frequently. Upon being asked what this was, he gave no other reply. But I heard from others that he had been let into sleep, and I was taught that some are let into these sleeps and undergo purgings by means of dreams, perhaps also by short awakenings, until they are rid of the fantasies they had carried with them. 1747, the 30th day of December. </p>

THAT FROM A PECULIAR MERCY CERTAIN SPIRITS ARE PREPARED [FOR HEAVEN] BY MEANS OF DEEP SLEEP, AND BY INFESTING DREAMS DURING SLEEP <p>There was also a certain spirit who said nothing else than "I am silent", and "I speak": and this pretty frequently. When I inquired what he meant, he said nothing else in reply, but I heard from others that he had been sent to sleep, and I was instructed that some were sent into such states of sleep and sustain vastations through dreams, perhaps also through brief intervals of wakefulness, until they have been deprived of the phantasies which they have drawn with them [from the world]. 1747, Dec. 30. </p>
