<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 999</h4><p>999. About the provinces of the renal spirits<p>It is known that there is a whole series of secretions of the blood's liquid components occurring in the general region from the kidneys to the bladder, and that the ducts called renal pelves widen out. It is also known that these secretions of liquid components range in series from the smallest particles of that kind, to the medium ones, to the last ones-those in the ureter, where a cortical-like tissue passes into a striated one. Through these substances the medium liquid components are discharged.<p>999. 1/2.<p>Because the secretions follow like this in a series, those spirits who are in the renal provinces do likewise. Those relating to the medium liquid components are near the side, below the elbow, and speak with a rather harsh, cracked voice. They also try to make their way inside, but it is only an attempt, the act does not follow. They do nothing but think, reviewing the things in their experience that they have observed in other souls and spirits, whom they picture to themselves in recognizable mental images, thereby portraying them as if they were those very souls and spirits. In this way, by drawing out their thoughts and examining them, they investigate whether they share anything in common. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 999</h4><p>999. CONCERNING THE PROVINCES OF THE KIDNEYS <p>It is well known that there is a complete series of secretions of the serosities of the blood, namely, in general, from the kidneys even to the bladder; also that the vessels or pelves increase in size; further, that the secretions of the serosities are likewise in a series from the least, the middle, and the last particles of that kind, thus [they end] in the ureter. Where there is as it were a cortical substance from which a striate substance proceeds, it is in these that the mediate serosities are secreted. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See the author's work, The Animal Kingdom, nos. 287 note r, and 289. <p>999 1/2. Because there is this succession in series, the spirits who are in the renal provinces are also in a certain series. Those who relate to the middle serosity are near the side beneath the elbow, and speak with a kind of hoarse or cracked voice, as it were. They desire to introduce themselves inwardly, but it is only an endeavor, the act does not follow. They merely think, and present to themselves, the things which have been found by experience, or which they have observed with other souls or spirits. They represent to themselves the images of these things as to what the others have thought, in order that they may be recognized. They then represent to themselves that they are, as it were, the same persons. In this way by thus attracting and exploring the thoughts of others, they explore as to whether there is anything in agreement. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 999 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>999. De provinciis renalium<p>Notum est quod integra series secretionum sit serositatum sanguinis, nempe in communi a renibus usque in vesicam, et quod vasa seu pelves <sup>1</sup></p><p>magnitudine crescant, tum quoque quod secretiones serositatum sint quoque in seriebus, a particulis minimis istius generis, mediis, et extremis, ita in uretere, ubi substantia quasi corticalis, e qua prodit striata, per eas mediae serositates excernuntur.<p>999a. Quia ita succedunt in serie, etiam ii qui in provinciis renalibus sunt, etiam in serie quadam sunt, qui mediam serositatem referunt, prope lateri infra ulnam sunt, et quadam voce quasi rauca seu bifida loquuntur, seque etiam inferre cupiunt intrinsecus, sed est modo conatus, actus non sequitur, ii modo cogitant, et sibi sistunt ea quae per experientiam, apud alios, animas seu spiritus observarunt, quorum imagines sibi quoad cogitata repraesentant, sic ut agnosci queant; repraesentant sibi tunc quod <sup>2</sup></p><p>quasi iidem sunt, ita explorant num aliquid conveniat, sic alliciendo eorum cogitata, et explorando. <sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has se<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has reperti<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quod quod </p>
