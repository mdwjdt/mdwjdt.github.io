<p>241.关于更内在的事物，或更内在事物的形式；它永远不会被打破，而是抵挡一切攻击，始终更坚定。它不同于内在形式，更不同于低层的属世形式。何为没有属天元素的属灵元素：它会被打破了。<p>⑴我正在思考形式，事实上正在思考更内在事物的形式，也就是属灵形式。它具有这样的性质：它抵挡一切攻击。属灵形式的属性是这样：它能通过焦虑和逼迫转化为一切可能，因而转化为无限的形式；它能依附于一切形式，甚至依附于低级气场中的形式，事实上仿佛对它们毫不关心，无论住在低级气场中的人如何以为它有麻烦，因为他们凭自己进行推理，并且越证实，就越紧张。由数量无限的事物构成的一样事物为保护另一样事物会聚在一起，并联结起来；因为总体事物里面没有任何事物不受个体事物，事实上不受最个体事物（甚至数目不可估量，事实上无限）的保护，因而被永远维系在一起，以致它永远不会被伤。从该形式的稳定性逻辑推理出的更多事物也能在它的完美性方面被推论出来。它的总体保护个体成分，一切个体成分都联结起来支持总体；事实上，这个形式越产出，或正在产出，换句话说，越柔软，就越坚定；因为那时，无论普遍还是个体事物中的至内在之物，也就是它的普遍元素会绑在一起等等。此外，没有任何事物如此得不理性，以致它不能追溯到某种理性事物，因而不能在有限元素的无限事物，也就是无限者，即弥赛亚神里面找到一个位置。<p>⑵这些就是今天早晨我关于形式的思维；更内在天堂和至内在天堂的天使，如我所想的那样注意到了它们，但这适用于作为一个整体的天堂，以及天使抵制、稳定、耐心和其它类似品质的状态，这些状态都是属灵和属天的；因此，他们通过传到我这里的声音证实说，他们惊奇于这类事物竟能进入人类的头脑。所以当人类头脑知道真理时，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，这种知道会进入更内在和至内在的天堂。<p>⑶当有虚假时，这在属世事物中是完全不同的，因为如今学术界利用虚假反对真理，以致几乎没有人知道何为真理，何为良善，无论属世事物上的，还是道德事物上的；因此，与更内在天堂，进而与至内在天堂的交流被夺走。当我正要写这些东西时，却发现找不到令人满意的属世词语，因为它们包含更多我头脑中无法轻易被除去，以便更清楚地揭示属灵元素的属世元素。<p>⑷然而，当它到达含有被伤的属世元素（创世记3:15）的内在形式时，情况就不同了。这内在形式与低层的属世形式，或与变得不完美的形式联系得如此紧密，以致它们能轻易被打破，并且它们越属世，就容易被打破。一切内在形式的连续性皆来自更内在的形式，更内在形式的连续性则来自至内在形式，进而来自弥赛亚神。事实上，属灵元素本身若没有至内在元素充满它，可以说就会被打破。我以多种方式，事实上通过奇妙的代表，以及经历获知这一点。如今正是这种属灵元素在人里面占据主导地位，并制造一种表象，仿佛它是更内在的；而事实上，它仅仅是内在的。因此，它被称为思维，但它纯粹是推理；因为理性事物本身内在拥有属灵元素在里面，这属灵元素反过来又内在拥有属天元素在里面。(1747年11月6日)</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 241</h4><p>241. About very inward things, or the form of very inward things, <sup>1</sup>which can never be broken through, but withstands every assault, and emerges ever firmer: differently from an inward form, and still more, from lower earthly forms<p>[Marginal Note: What the spiritual is without the heavenly: it is broken]<p>1.) I was in thought about forms and in fact about that of very inward things, which is the spiritual form. It is of such a nature that it withstands every assault.<p>The properties of that spiritual form are: that it can be reduced by anxieties and pressures into all possible, thus an infinite number, of forms; it can be attached to all forms whatsoever in a lower region, and really be hardly troubled by them at all (however much those inhabiting the lower realm may think it is [troubled], because they reason from self); <sup>2</sup>and it becomes all the firmer, the more stress it comes under. Each one of an immeasurably great number comes together and unites for the protection of the other; for there is nothing in a community that is not protected by the individual, in fact most individual components - even up to an immeasurably great, indeed infinite number - and thus held fast forever, so that it can never be harmed.<p>And many of the things deduced logically from the stability of that form, may also be deduced in regard to its perfection. Collectively it protects the individual component, and every individual component joins together in support of the community; and it is a fact that the more this form yields, or is yielding, or in other words, the softer it is, the more firmly it stands - for then what is innermost, both universally and in the individual parts, which is its universal element, joins in, and so on, etc., etc. <p>[Marginal Note: And that there is nothing so irrational, that it is not traced back to something rational, thus which does not have a place in the immeasurably great number of finite elements, i.e. in the infinite - that is in God the Messiah.]<p>2.) These were my thoughts this morning on the subject of forms; and the angels of the very inward heaven, and of the innermost one, received [them] I believe, but as applied to heaven as a whole and the angels' modes of resistance, stability, patience, and other like qualities, which are spiritual and heavenly; and so they confirmed these things by a voice that reached me, saying they were amazed that such a thought had ever been able to come into a human mind. So when human minds know truths, then from the mercy of God the Messiah, this passes over to the very inward and the innermost heavens.<p>3.) It is entirely different in the case of falsities, even in natural science, for which the learned world today is so avidly grasping that hardly anyone knows what is true and what is good, either in matters of natural science or of morality - as a result of which, communication with the very inward, and thus with the innermost heaven, is being taken away.<p>When I was writing these things, [I noticed that] earthly words are not adequate, because they contain more of the earthly element in my mind than could be removed so as to reveal what is spiritual more clearly.<p>4.) However, it is a different matter when it comes to the inward form, <sup>1</sup>which contains that earthly element that was bruised [cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_15.htm">Gen. 3:15</a>]: this form communicates so closely with the lower earthly forms, or forms that have become imperfect, that they can easily be broken - and the more earthly they are, the more easily. All its perpetuity comes from the very inward form, whose perpetuity in turn comes from the innermost, and thus from God the Messiah.<p>In fact, the spiritual element itself, without the innermost filling it up, so to speak, is broken. This I have learned in many ways, and indeed, by wonderful symbolic displays, as well as experiences. This is the spiritual element that dominates in man today and creates the impression of being more inward, when it is only inward. Therefore it is called thinking, but it is [mere] reasoning; for anything rational is accompanied by the true spiritual inwardly within it, and this in turn by the heavenly within it [cf. 209]. 1747, the 6th day of November (old calendar).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The manuscript has "interiorum," but the context calls for "intimiorum."<br><br>2.&nbsp;That is, from the point of view of self-love, which would be troubled. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 241</h4><p>241. CONCERNING THE MORE INTERIOR THINGS, OR THE FORM OF INTERIOR THINGS IT CAN NEVER BE OVERCOME BUT IT RESISTS EVERY ASSAULT AND ALWAYS REMAINS THE FIRMER. IT IS OTHERWISE WITH THE INTERIOR FORM: THUS STILL LESS WITH THE LOWER NATURAL FORMS. mWHAT THE SPIRITUAL IS WITHOUT THE CELESTIAL IT IS BROKENn <p>I was thinking about forms, and indeed about the form of the more interior things, which is the spiritual form. It is of such a nature that it resists every assault; and its properties are such that by means of anxieties and straitnesses, it can be reduced into all possible, thus infinite forms; it can be applied to all forms, even to those in a lower sphere, and indeed, as if it cared nothing about them, however much those who dwell in the lower sphere may suppose otherwise because they reason from themselves, and also because the more they are confirmed, so much the more are they straitened. One thing consisting of an indefinite number of things concurs and unites itself for the defence of another; for there is nothing in the general which is not defended by the single, indeed by the most single things, even to what is indefinite, yea to what is infinite, and is thus held together to eternity, so that it can never be injured; and many more things, deduced according to order from the constancy of that form, can be deduced in regard to its perfections. Its general defends the particular, and every particular conspires to the firm establishment of the general; and indeed the more it yields, or is yielding, and as I may say, the softer it is, the more firmly does it stand: for then the inmost in the universal and in the single things, which is its universal, binds together and so forth, etc. <p>mMoreover there is nothing so irrational that it may not be reduced to something rational, and thus be found in the indefinite things of the finite, that is, in the Infinite: here in God Messiah.n <sup>1</sup><p>These were my thoughts about forms this morning, and the angels of the more interior and of the inmost heaven, as I believe, took note of it, but as applied to the whole heaven and to their [states of] resistance and constancy, to their patience and similar things which are spiritual and celestial; and thus they confirmed them by a voice conveyed to me, saying, that they marveled that such a thing could ever enter the human mind. Thus when human minds know verities, then of the mercy of God Messiah, that [knowledge] passes over to the more interior and inmost heavens. It is indeed altogether different in natural things when there are falsities, by which the learned world is at this day so opposed [to the truth], that scarcely anyone knows what truth is and what good, either in natural or in moral things: hence, also, communication with the more interior heaven, and thus with the inmost, is taken away. When I would write these things, natural expressions cannot be satisfactory, because they contain more of the natural in my mind than could have easily been removed, and so have the spiritual presented more purely. It is, however, different in the interior from where is the natural which is injured; this so communicates with the lower natural things, or with forms rendered imperfect, that they can be easily broken, and the more natural they are, the more easily are they broken. All the continuity of the interior form comes from the more interior, and this from the inmost, and thus from God Messiah. Indeed, the spiritual itself, without the inmost as it were infilling it, is broken, as I have discovered in many ways, and by wonderful representations, and also by experiences. It is this spiritual which as yet dominates in man, and induces an appearance as though it were the more interior, when yet it is the interior; so it is called thought, but it is only reasoning: for the rational has with itself the true spiritual inwardly within it, and this the celestial inwardly within it. 1747, Nov. 6, o.s. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;These words were added by the author in the margin of the MS. and seem to belong here. They are thus referred to in the Index (s.v. Dominus): "There is nothing so irrational that it cannot be bent into what is rational by Infinite Power, that is, by the Lord." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 241 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>241. De intimioribus, seu forma interiorum, quod nusquam expugnari possit, sed quod resistat unicuique insultui, et semper maneat firmior: aliter forma interior, ita minus adhuc naturales inferiores. [m] Quid spirituale absque coelesti, quod frangatur. [n]<p>In cogitatione fui de formis, et quidem intimiorum, quae forma spiritualis est, quod talis sit, ut omni insultui resistat, et quod ejus proprietates sint, ut [possit] redigi <sup>1</sup></p><p>, per anxietates et angustationes in omnes usquam dabiles sic infinitas formas, applicari ad omnes usque in inferiori sphaera, et quidem eas quasi nihil curare, utcunque ii qui in inferiori sphaera habitant, id putent, quia ex se ratiocinantur, tum quod eo magis confirmentur, quo magis angustantur; unum ex indefinitis concurrit seque unit ad defensionem alterius, nam nihil est in communi quod non a singulis imo a singularissimis usque [ad] <sup>2</sup></p><p>indefinitum, imo ad infinitum defendatur, et sic in aeternum contineatur, ut nusquam laedi queat; et plura, quae ex formae istius constantia per ordinem deducta deduci queunt, quo spectat ejus perfectiones: commune ejus defendit particulare, et omne particulare conspirat ad constabiliendum commune, et quidem quo plus cedit, seu cedens est ac ut ita dicam, mollius, eo firmius constat, nam tunc intimum in universali ac in singulis, quod est ejus universale, conjurat, et sic porro, etc. etc.; m. tum <sup>3</sup></p><p>quod nihil tam irrationale sit, quod non in rationale reducatur, et sic non: inveniatur in indefinitis finitorum, id est, in infinito, h.e. in Deo Messia. n.. Haec cogitata sunt hodie mane ex formis, et angeli intimioris coeli, ac intimi, id ut credo, apperceperunt sed applicata ad totum coelum et eorum resistentias et constantias, ad patientias et similia quae spiritualia e coelestia sunt, ac ita confirmarunt ea, voce ad me perlata quod mirati sint, quod usquam tale in mentem humanam venire potuisset, ita quum mentes humanae veritates sciunt tunc ex Dei Messiae misericordia, id transit ad intimiores coelos et intimos; aliter prorsus dum falsitates, etiam in naturalibus, quibus eruditus orbis hodie ita appassus <sup>4</sup></p><p>est, ut nemo fere sciat quid verum et quid bonum in naturalibus nec in moralibus, inde quoque communicatio cum coelo intimiori, et sic cum intimo aufertur. Cum haec scriberem etiam voces naturales nec possunt satisfacere, quia plus naturalis in mente mea continent, quam ut id ita auferri potuisset, et sic spirituale purius sisti. Aliter autem est in forma interiori, ubi naturale, quod laesum est, hoc communicat ita cum naturalibus inferioribus, seu cum formis imperfectis factis, ut facile frangi queant, et quo plus naturale adhuc, eo facilius, omnis perpetuitas ejus venit ab intimiori, et hujus ab intimo, et sic a Deo Messia, imo ipsum spirituale, absque intimo, quasi implente illud, frangitur, quod multis expertus, et quidem per mirabiles repraesentationes, tum per experientias, hoc spirituale est quod dominatur in homine adhuc, et speciem inducit tanquam sit intimius, cum tamen est interius, ita vocatur cogitatio, sed est ratiocinatio, nam rationale secum habet verum spirituale intus in se, et hoc coeleste intus in se. 1747, die 6 Nov. st. v.<p>4<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ut redigi, in J.F.I.
