<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2429</h4><p>2429. About those who trust in their own prudence<p>I spoke with souls about whom I knew, that during their life they had inwardly been of the firm opinion that all things down to the very least depend on and spring from their own prudence - an opinion the greatest part of humanity tends to hold. To this I was prompted to say that from very many experiences if not some hundred, recurring almost daily, I know for certain that those who trust in themselves and their own wisdom, spirits are permitted to lead, to persuade, and to inspire with desire, so that the person may desire something most intensely. And they add confirmatory things so that the person is convinced that nothing is truer than what he or she is thinking, and anything that goes contrary to it, those people either do not see at all, or they reject, or they refute. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2429</h4><p>2429. CONCERNING THOSE WHO TRUST TO SELF-DERIVED [propriae] PRUDENCE. <p>I spoke with souls who I knew had during their life held this to be a stable truth, that each and all things depend on and flow from their prudence, as is the custom with the greatest part of mankind; to whom [cui for quibus I think] it was granted to say that from very many if not several hundred experiences, recurring almost daily, I know for certain that those who trust in themselves and their own prudence it is permitted to spirits to lead, to persuade, to induce cupidity, so that [the man] may very much desire [the thing] [it]: they add confirmations, so that the man is persuaded that nothing is more true than that which he thinks, then also they either do not see, or reject or refute entirely those things which contradict. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2429 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2429. De iis qui confidunt propriae prudentiae<p>Locutus sum cum animabus, quas novi, quod in vita sua habuerint eam opinionem in se firmam, quod omnia et singula dependeant et fluant ex prudentia eorum, sicut maxima pars hominum solet habere <sup>1</sup></p><p>, cui dicere dabatur, quod ab experientiis permultis si non aliquot centum, quotidie fere recurrentibus, pro certo sciam, quod qui sibi suaeque prudentiae confidunt, permittatur spiritibus eos ducere, iis persuadere, cupiditatem inducere; ut id cupiat quam maxime, adjiciant confirmantia, sic ut persuasus sit homo, quod nihil verius sit, quam quod is cogitet, tunc quoque ea quae contradicunt, prorsus vel non vident, vel<p>(2430.) rejiciunt, vel refutant; quod talis spirituum operatio in homines qui sibi suaeque prudentiae fidunt, sit, hoc innumeris experientiis scire mihi datum est, sic ut veritas sit, cui fides habenda, cum tamen non est nisi permissio malorum spirituum ita homini persuadendi, et cum talis sit homo, quod omnia consilia eorum <sup>2</sup></p><p>ita credita [sint] firme, in ejus et communis rei perniciem tendunt, nam quae a malis spiritibus ut a se, omnia in perniciem <sup>3</sup></p><p>tendunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has esse<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ejus<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has pernicium </p>
