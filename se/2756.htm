<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2756</h4><p>2756. About the soul<p>It was granted me to speak with angels about the soul, saying that the human race today does not know what the soul is, and that they develop various hypotheses for themselves about the soul, in ignorance as to what the soul is. I was therefore instructed that if by the soul is meant life, then the Lord Alone is life, but that if by the soul are meant inward human minds, then all those organic substances are called souls that are nearest to and beginnings of the things that follow in order, as that the earthly mind is the nearest soul to those things that belong to the body, that the spiritual mind is the soul of those things that belong to the earthly mind, and that there is a still more inward human soul, unknown to humanity, which is the soul of those things that belong to the spiritual mind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2756</h4><p>2756. CONCERNING THE SOUL. <p>It was granted me to speak this day with angels, concerning the soul, that the human race at this day does not know what the soul [is] and form for themselves various hypotheses concerning the soul, in [their] ignorance [of] what the soul [is]; I am therefore instructed that if by soul is understood life, then the Lord alone is life: but if by soul are understood the interior minds of man, that all those organic substances which are proximate [next] [proximoe] and their principles which follow in order may be called souls: for instance, that the natural mind is the proximate soul of those things which properly belong to the body; that the spiritual mind is the source of those things which belong to the natural mind, and that there is a still more interior soul in man, which is the soul of the things which belong to the spiritual mind. Man is ignorant thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2756 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2756. De anima<p>Cum angelis loqui datum est de anima, quod genus humanum hodie non sciat quid anima, et quod varias hypotheses sibi de anima, in ignorantia quid anima, forment, ideo instructus sum, quod si per animam intelligatur vita, quod tunc Dominus Solus sit vita, at si per animam intelligantur mentes interiores hominis, quod animae dicantur omnes istae organicae substantiae quae proximae sunt, et principia eorum quae in ordine consequuntur, sicut quod mens naturalis sit anima proxima eorum, quae proprie corporis sunt; quod mens spiritualis sit anima eorum quae sunt mentis naturalis, et quod adhuc intimior anima sit in homine, quae est anima eorum quae sunt mentis spiritualis, quam homo ignorat. </p>
