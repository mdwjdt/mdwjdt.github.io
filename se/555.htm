<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>555.他们的月亮照耀着他们，所以他们生活在光明中。那些想得到敬拜（见519节），自称为至圣的人呼求“至高主”，并将主称为“至高主”，而不像其他人那样称为“独一主”；他们不喜欢称太阳为“太阳”，因为他们相信，太阳是他们至高主的居所。因此，他们是拜自然的人。也正因如此，他们想变得如火一般，甚至看上去就是火；他们之所以不断向我暗示“至高主”（549节），是因为他们也强烈地渴望被称为主。他们是那些不愿称呼太阳名字的人。其他人说，他们在撒谎，因为他们知道太阳比他们的月亮或大星更亮，而且有巨大的热量，他们躲到帐篷里设法避开这热。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 555</h4><p>555. Their Moons shine on them, so that they live in light. Those who want to be worshipped [see <a href="519.htm">519</a>] - being those who call themselves the holiest ones, and who call and name [the Lord] "the highest lord" and not, like the others, "the one only Lord" - do not like to call the sun "sun," for they believe it is the dwelling place of their Lord most high.<p>They are therefore nature worshippers. It is also for this reason that they want to be fiery, as they even appear to be, and why they have continually suggested to me "the most high Lord" [<a href="549.htm">549</a>], because they strongly desire also to be called lords. These are the ones who do not want to call the sun by name. The others said that they are lying, because they know that the sun shines larger than their moons, or great stars, and with intense heat, which they seek to avoid by withdrawing into their tents. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 555</h4><p>555. Their moons shine upon them, so that they live in light. Those who want themselves to be adored, and call themselves most holy, call upon and speak of the "Supreme Lord" and not, as the others do, of the "One Only Lord". They are unwilling to name the sun, for they suppose the habitation of their Supreme Lord to be there; thus they are worshippers of nature, on which account they want to be fiery, as they also appear; and they continually suggest to me the "Supreme Lord", because they also seek to be called lords themselves. These are they who are unwilling to name the sun. The others said that they lie, because they know that the sun shines more than their moons or great stars, and with much heat, which they seek to avoid by betaking themselves to their tents. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 555 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>555. Eorum Lunae, lucent iis, sic ut vivant in luce; ii qui se adorari volunt, et sunt qui se vocant sanctissimos, ac supremum dominum non <sup>1</sup></p><p>ut alii "unicum Dominum" vocant <sup>2</sup></p><p>et dicunt, ii nolunt nominare solem, nam ibi putant habitaculum esse supremi sui Domini, quare sunt cultores naturae, quapropter etiam ignei esse volunt, sicut etiam apparent, et continue mihi suggerunt, "supremum Dominum," quia se dominos quoque vocari ambiunt, hi sunt qui non nominare volunt solem: caeteri dixerunt, quod ii mentiantur, quia norunt, quod sol major lunis suis, seu magnis stellis, luceat, et cum multo aestu, quem evitare studentes, in sua tentoria se conferunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has dominum, non<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Dominum, vocant </p>
