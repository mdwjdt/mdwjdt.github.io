<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2977</h4><p>2977. The realms cannot, I suppose, be recognized and consequently be understood except by those who have inner sight [<a href="1769.htm">1769</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2734.htm">2734</a>], for they are realms of spirits and of angels that have been seen quite plainly by me, as well as by spirits, and I have spoken with them about those realms quite at length, after which they and I were shown by actual experience what they are like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2977</h4><p>2977. The spheres cannot I think be thoroughly known [cognosci], and therefore cannot be understood, save by those who have perception, for [they] are the spheres of spirits and angels. They have been quite plainly perceived by me, as also by spirits, and I have spoken with them to a considerable extent concerning these spheres, and it was then shown by living experience, to them and to me, of what nature they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2977 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2977. Sphaerae non reor cognosci possunt proinde nec intelligi, nisi ab iis quibus perceptio, nam sunt sphaerae spirituum, et angelorum, a me satis manifeste perceptae sunt, tum etiam a spiritibus, et cum iis de sphaeris istis satis multum loquutus, et tunc per vivam experientiam iis et mihi demonstratum quales sunt. </p>
