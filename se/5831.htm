<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5831</h4><p>5831. About those who were thrown down from on high and from heaven<p>All were explored as to whether they looked down from on high into lower regions and roundabout, and all who had looked down with desire were thrown down for the reason that by doing so their thinking was extended into other things than pertained to their society, and their consciousness was occupied either by mere curiosity or by the desire to exert control and also to harm others, which they did not dare do as long as they were in a society. This continued for a long time; consequently they were thrown down from the prior heaven, and in this way societies of heaven were cleansed. It was frequently said to them that by doing this they appear to evil spirits who are below who know how to attach themselves to them, and when they once are attached, they cannot be separated, in this way admitting a hellish crowd in among the society.</p><p>[2] Those who perform useful services and love what is good for society do not know what it is to look around and downward. There is a resistance when they think about this. And all those who are like this are invisible to everyone roundabout, for by so doing they turn their back to such activities. They look down in various ways, all around. These there are those who are on the other side of their lowest region, and most have in mind controlling some and harming others. This has happened thousands and thousands of times. In this way they were thrown down from the prior heaven. In this way the followers of the Dragon and those who had only faith and not a life of faith were thrown down, and many others likewise. All those who look down have a temperament different from the temperaments of [those in] the society. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5831</h4><p>5831. THOSE WHO ARE CAST DOWN FROM ON HIGH AND FROM HEAVEN. <p>All were explored as to whether they look down from on high into the lower levels, and roundabout; and all who, from lust, looked down, were cast down. The reason was, because their minds were thus spread abroad into other places than those which are of the society [where they are]; and there was fixed in their purpose either mere curiosity, or else the lust of ruling and also of injuring others; which they durst not attempt as long as they are in a society. This lasted a long time. They were thus cast down from the former heaven, and the societies of heaven were thereby purged. It was frequently said to them, that, in this way, they appear to the evil spirits who are beneath, who know how to adjoin them to themselves; and when they have once adjoined them, they cannot be separated: thus admitting the infernal crew within society. Those who perform uses, and love the good of the society, do not know what looking round and down is: there is resistance when they think it. All, moreover, who are of such a character [as this last], are invisible to all roundabout; for they thus turn the back upon such things. - They look down, roundabout, in different ways. There are those who look across their own territory; and the majority cherish in the mind, ruling over others and injuring others. This happened thousands and thousands of times. Thus they were cast down out of the former heaven. In this way were the dragonists cast down; likewise, those who were in faith alone and not in any life of faith; also many others. All who look down are of a disposition foreign to the dispositions of the society. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5831 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5831. De illis qui dejecti de alto et de coelo<p>Explorati sunt omnes, num despiciant in inferiora, et circumcirca ex alto, et omnes qui ex cupidine despexerunt, dejecti sunt, causa erat, quia sic mentes eorum diffusae erant in alia quam quae societatis sunt, et animo insideret vel mera curiositas, vel cupiditas imperandi, et quoque laedendi alios, quod non ausi sunt quamdiu in societate sunt, hoc perstitit diu, sic dejecti e priori coelo, et sic repurgatae societates coeli, dictum iis saepe quod sic appareant spiritibus malis qui infra, qui sciunt adjungere eos sibi, et cum semel adjunxerunt, non possint separari, ita admittentes turbam infernalem intra societatem: illi qui usus faciunt, et amant bonum societatis, non sciunt quid sit circumspicere et despicere, est contranisus cum id cogitant; et omnes qui tales sunt, inconspicui sunt omnibus circumcirca, sic enim vertunt tergum ad talia. - Despiciunt variis modis, circumcirca, sunt qui trans fundum suum, et plerique animo gerunt imperare aliis, et laedere alios, hoc millies et millies factum, ita dejecti sunt e coelo priori, ita draconiaci, et qui in sola fide et nulla vita fidei, et plures alii. Omnes qui despiciunt alieno animo sunt a societatis animis. </p>
