<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5155</h4><p>5155. About heaven and its joy<p>All joy, bliss, happiness, felicity, and delight in the heavens comes from the affection for use for the sake of use, and is according to the nature and amount of the affection and according to the nature of the use, because heaven is a kingdom of uses. If anything is regarded for any other purpose than use, for example, for the sake of eminence, personal glory, profit, if it looks elsewhere than to use itself, thus, if it looks to self and to the world on account of self, then in the degree it does so it dies as to the affection [for uses]. Its nature is changed in the degree that it does this since it is the use to self that is the end in view, and in the degree this is looked to, in the same degree a person is not in heaven and lacks the life of heaven. If use to self is the governing factor, then one is no longer in heaven, but in hell, when use to self is the governing factor, there is no reception of any happiness and inner felicity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5155</h4><p>5155. CONCERNING HEAVEN AND ITS JOY.<p>All joy, bliss, prosperity, happiness and delight, in the heavens, is in the affection of use for the sake of use, and is according to the quality and quantity of the affection, and according to the quality of the use; in fact, heaven is a kingdom of uses; and if anything else than use is regarded as an end, as eminence, self-glory, or gain, which looks elsewhere than to use itself, thus [any end] which regards self, and the world for the sake of self - then, in proportion to the extent to which it [i.e. the end of use for the sake of use] perishes from the affection, in the same proportion is the quality of the affection changed; since it is use on account of self which is the end; and, as far as this is regarded, so far is [a man] not in heaven, and is destitute of the life of heaven. And if use for the sake of self has dominion, then he is no longer in heaven, but in hell and, then, he enjoys no reception of any prosperity, or happiness, interiorly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5155 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5155. De coelo et ejus gaudio<p>Omne gaudium, beatum, faustum, felix et jucundum in coelis est ex affectione usus propter usum, et est secundum quale et quantum affectionis, et secundum quale usus, nam coelum est regnum usuum; si spectatur aliud pro fine quam usus, ut propter eminentiam, gloriam sui, lucrum, quod spectat aliunde quam ad ipsum usum, ita quod spectat se, et mundum propter se, tunc tantum perit in affectione, mutatur quale ejus secundum id, quoniam est usus pro se quod pro fine est, et quantum id spectatur tantum non in coelo est, et absque vita coeli: sique usus pro se dominatur, tunc non amplius in coelo, sed in inferno, et tunc non receptio alicujus fausti et felicis interius. </p>
