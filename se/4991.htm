<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4991</h4><p>4991. She was with me for many weeks and she brought this [aura] with me wherever she wanted. She drew it out, let it sink down from the cerebrum and held it below, besides many other things. She remained fixed in a place near the occiput, between the cerebrum and cerebellum, and could not be driven away, which was also due to the fact that she was skilled in using wicked tricks from an inflow from those who were from eastern India. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4991</h4><p>4991. She was with me for many weeks, and took this [sphere of hers <sup>1</sup>] along with me wherever she wished. She led it forth; she drew it out from the cerebrum; she held it below, besides doing many other things. She fixed herself in a place near the occiput, between the cerebrum and cerebellum, and could not be driven away: which also was on account of the fact that she was skilled in abominable arts, from the influx from those who were from Eastern India.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See above, No. 4989: "She had a sphere of a certain species of good." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4991 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4991. Illa fuerat apud me per plures septimanas, et ducebat hanc [sphaeram] mecum, quocunque vellet, educebat, deprimebat e cerebro, tenebat infra, praeter plura alia: inhaerebat loco ad occipitium, inter cerebrum et cerebellum, et non potuit abigi, etiam ex causa quia callebat artes nefandas, ex influxu ab illis qui ab India orientali. </p>
