<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3894</h4><p>3894. About auras<p>Just as when the dung of horses was seen I observed that certain spirits could not stand the aura arising from it - namely, of reasonings in the case of evil ones, and perhaps of scientific confirmations with the good - so it is in other instances, as when I was eating buttered bread, then certain spirits, or societies of spirits, were displeased even to the point of threatening to harm my tongue, saying that they could not stand it, for the reason that butter symbolizes what is heavenly, thus the aura of the good, which the evil could not bear. Therefore I had to abstain from butter for a long time; likewise that one kind of tea was more pleasing than another just because they drew from it an aura that had less of a spiritual quality. So it was in regard to many other things that I ate, or drank, such as milk, and other drinks, all of which showed that on being seen, they brought about the corresponding spiritual, or heavenly, aura, which was unbearable. There occurred many similar instances, on which it was not granted me to reflect. 1748, 6 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3894</h4><p>3894. CONCERNING SPHERES.<p>It was observed, that as when the dung of horses was seen, certain spirits could not endure the sphere thence arising, [from its corresponding to] that of reasonings with the evil, and perhaps as being confirmatory of scientifics with good; so also in other things, as when I ate butter upon bread, then certain spirits, or a society of spirits, were so indignant that they threatened evil to my tongue, saying that they could not endure it, for the reason that butter signifies the celestial, whence arises the sphere of the good which the evil cannot bear; wherefore I ought [they said] for a long time to abstain from butter; likewise that one vessel ["thee"] was more agreeable than another, for the sole reason that they thence contracted a sphere which was less spiritual. So also in regard to many other things which I ate and drank, as milk and the like; from which it appeared that the seen correspondence of the spiritual or celestial sphere should be preserved, which [however] could not be endured. Many similar things occurred, upon which it is not given to reflect. - 1748, November 6. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3894 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3894. De sphaeris<p>Observatum est, sicut dum fimus equorum visus, quod quidam spiritus non sufferre possent sphaeram inde oriundam, nempe ratiociniorum apud malos, et forte confirmantium scientificorum apud bonos; ita in aliis, sicut cum butyrum super pane ederem, tunc spiritus quidam, seu societates spirituum indignati usque ut linguae intentarent malum, dicentes quod non sufferre possent, ex causa quia butyrum significat coeleste, inde sphaera bonorum, quam mali non sufferre possent, quare diu abstinere debui a butyro; similiter quod unum (thee) magis placeret quam alterum, solum ideo, quod inde traherent [talem] sphaeram quod minus spirituale [inesset]. Ita in pluribus aliis, quae comederem, et biberem, sicut lac, et alia, ex quibus constabat, quod visa correspondentem sphaeram spiritualem, aut coelestem causarentur, quae non sufferri posset; plura similia obvenerunt, super quae non reflectere datur. 1748, 6 Nov. </p>
