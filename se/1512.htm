<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1512</h4><p>1512. Kings and great Personages are treated the same way as people of the lowest lot<p>In the heaven of spirits, where people come as souls, no distinction exists for kings and great personages, thus there is no regard for person. I have known some beclad with great dignity and power, with whom I associated and conversed for quite a long time, who had been treated by spirits with as much disrespect as if they had been of the lowest lot. As they themselves admitted, it is absolutely nothing to be powerful, great, learned in the world. 1748, 18 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1512</h4><p>1512. THAT KINGS AND MAGNATES ARE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY AS MEN OF THE LOWEST CLASS <p>When souls come into the heaven of spirits no distinction is made in regard to kings and magnates, thus there is no respect of persons. I have known some of great dignity and power with whom I associated and conversed for a long time. They were treated by spirits with as much indignity as if they were of the lowest class, so that at length they themselves confessed that to be powerful, great, or learned in the world is of no account whatever. 1748, Mar. 18. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1512 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1512. Quod Reges, Magnates, similiter ac infimae sortis homines tractentur<p>In spirituum coelo, in quod dum animae veniunt, nullum discrimen habetur regum et magnatum, sic nullus respectus personarum, cognovi quosdam magnae dignitatis et potentiae, cum quibus diu satis interfui, et loquutus sum, ii tam indigne a spiritibus tractati sunt, ac si essent infimae sortis, ut tandem iidem fassi sint, quod ihil prorsus sit in mundo esse potens, magnus, doctus. 1748, 18 Martius. </p>
