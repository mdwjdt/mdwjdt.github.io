<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2359</h4><p>2359. Spirits who were unwilling to believe this and wanted, as usual, to guess at the reason, were clinging somewhat to their doubt about whether this was really the case, even though from their location these same spirits were able to observe and determine the same thing, and could not deny it. But because the reason evaded them and the phenomenon had been previously unknown to them, and because it is an illusion, I was prompted to tell them that one should believe a sensory and visible experience. As in bodily life there are innumerable phenomena whose cause we do not know, but when we have sensory, as well as ocular, experience, we nevertheless no longer doubt, but believe. That they are innumerable is obvious from the countless phenomena that occur in the mineral, </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2359</h4><p>2359. Spirits who were unwilling to believe this, wishing, as is their custom, to conjecture the reason [thereof], doubted considerably whether matters were so, although from their situation the same spirits could have observed and known the same, and not been able to deny it; but because the reason was hidden from them, and because the thing was previously unknown and was an appearance, it was granted to tell them that sensual and visible experience should be believed. Like as in the life of the body, innumerable things are therein [ibi] of whose cause we are ignorant, but when they have the experience of the senses and ocular experience, they do not any longer doubt, but believe. That there are innumerable such things, </p>

Spiritus, qui hoc credere noluerunt, volentes, ut solitum iis, conjectare causas, aliquantum in dubio haerebant, num ita se res haberent, tametsi ex situ iidem potuerunt idem observare et scire, nec negare potuerunt, sed quia causa latuit eos, et quia prius ignotum, et [ignotum] quod apparentia, iis dicere dabatur, quod experientiae sensuali et visibili credendum; sicut in vita corporis, ibi innumerabilia sunt, quorum causam ignoramus, sed cum experientia sensuum est, et ocularis, usque tamen non amplius dubitant, sed credunt; quod innumerabilia talia sint, constare potest<p>(2360.) ab innumerabilibus quae in regno minerali, vegetabili, animali <sup>1</sup></p><p>, atmosphaeris existunt, sicut quod in corpore humano fluida non quaerant secundum pondera sua, altitudines et situs, [sed] quod sursum sit ubi peripheriae, sicut in globo telluris, et corporibus <sup>2</sup></p><p>circumactis, quod plantae a semine crescant, quod flores colorati, pulchri inde, quod odores, quod gustus, quod visus et auditus, quod cogitatio, et innumerabilia alia, si non crederentur cum ab experientia [sunt] vera <sup>3</sup></p><p>, tunc nihil crederetur; nunc familiare iis factum est, quare plures credunt. 1748, 18 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
