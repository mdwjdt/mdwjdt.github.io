<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2406</h4><p>2406. The condition of people in bodily life is different from that of souls after death<p>Besides many observations to be found elsewhere, as the Lord sees fit, there are also these: souls after death have means of salvation, they have buildings for instruction, they have books from which they are taught, they have the Word of the Lord, and many other things, except that their condition is different in regard to the circles they choose and are able to choose, and that their senses display to them many objects, so their understanding and will are controlled by different means. For in bodily life they are left to themselves to a much greater degree than after the life of the body, and are thus on a broader field of freedom, through which they are led about. 1748, 25 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2406</h4><p>2406. THE CONDITION OF MEN IN THE LIFE OF THE BODY IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF SOULS AFTER DEATH. <p>Besides many things of which, the Lord thinking worthy, [I shall treat] elsewhere, there are also these things: they have means of health [media salutis], have edifices where they are instructed, books out of which they are instructed, [and] the Word of the Lord, and many other things. Besides which, their condition is different in reference to societies which they select, and are able to choose, as also that the senses represent many objects to them, and thus by other means is their will and intellect ruled. For in the life of the body they are much more left to themselves than after the life of the body, thus [during life] are in a more spacious field of liberty, through which they are led around. - 1748, June 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2406 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2406. Alia conditio hominum in vita corporis quam animarum post mortem<p>Praeter multa, quae alibi dignante Domino, etiam sunt haec, quod habeant media salutis, habeant aedes, ubi instruantur, habeant libros, e quibus instruantur, habeant Verbum Domini; et plura alia, praeter quod alia conditio eorum, quoad societates, quas eligunt, et eligere possunt, tum quod sensus iis multa objecta repraesentent, et quod sic per alia media eorum intellectus et voluntas regatur, sunt enim in vita corporis multo magis sibi relicti, quam post vitam corporis, ita in spatiosiori campo libertatis, per quem circumducuntur [cf. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2406/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2365" target=_top>2365</a>]. 1748, 25 Junius. </p>
