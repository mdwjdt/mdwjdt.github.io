<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4750</h4><p>4750. The nature of self-love can be evident from this, for inwardly C[harles] XII had more self-love than all others, and it infected him in his life and doctrinal thought, specifically: <p>1) he wanted not only to put hell under his control and become the greatest devil, but also <p>2) put heaven under his control and place his throne above the Divine, <p>3) entirely deny the Divine, and believe that it is nothing more than what thinks and wills in man, thus it is man. <p>4) They (who love themselves) root God out of their hearts and deny Him with the result that they condemn those to death who from conscience maintain [otherwise], which I actually heard him frightfully do when he heard someone [expressing belief]. <p>5) He denies all good and truth, thus all faith and charity. Such is the nature of those whose inner person's life is self-love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4750</h4><p>4750. It could hence be evident of what quality is self-love for Charles XII was interiorly in self-love beyond all men, and had imbued it in life and doctrine; in that, namely, first, he not only wished to subjugate hell and become the greatest devil; but also, secondly, to subjugate heaven and place his throne above the Divine; thirdly, wholly to deny the Divine, and to believe it no other than that, in man, which thinks and wills, thus man; fourthly, in that [all such] thus root out God Himself from their hearts, and deny Him, so as to sentence, as it were, to death, those that deliberately affirm a God - which, also, he himself did in a dreadful manner, when he heard a certain one do so; and fifthly, in that he denies all things of good and truth, thus all things of faith and charity. Such are those, the life of whose internal man is self-love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4750 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4750. Qualis est amor sui, inde constare potuit, nam Carl. XII prae omnibus in amore sui interius fuerat, et eum imbuerat vita et doctrina, quod nempe<p>1) non solum subjugare vellet infernum, et fieri maximus diabolus: sed etiam<p>2) subjugare coelum, et ponere thronum supra Divinum.<p>3) Prorsus negare Divinum, et credere id non aliud esse, quam quod in homine cogitat et vult, ita homo.<p>4) Quod ipsum Deum eradicent corde suo ita, ac negent, ut devoveant quasi morti illos qui ex animo statuunt, quod etiam ipse fecit dire cum audivit quendam.<p>5) Quod neget omnia boni et veri, ita omnia fidei et charitatis. Tales sunt quorum vita interni hominis est amor sui. </p>
