<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5174</h4><p>5174. They also said that when they go out and see changes in their houses, in their clothing and in their gardens or fields, and if the changes are for the worse, either they don't appear or appear dimly, or other things replace earlier ones, they know that they have done something wrong. Then, they said, they examine themselves, they search, and from this discover their evil and repent. When this is done, their prior appearance returns, and if they become better than before, then they appear better. Also, they especially explore such things from how they appear. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5174</h4><p>5174. They also said, that, when they go out, and behold the changes in their houses, in their garments and in their gardens or fields - if the changes are for the worse, so that the objects either do not appear or appear obscurely, or if other things have succeeded in place of the former, they know they have done something evil; and that they then examine and investigate in themselves, and hence find out their evil and perform the work of repentance. When this is done, the former appearance of things returns; and, if they have become better than before, then the appearances are better. At such a time, they explore such a matter, principally from their faces. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5174 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5174. Dixerunt etiam quod cum exeunt, et vident mutationes in suis domibus, in suis vestibus, inque suis hortis, aut campis, si mutationes sint in deterius, quod vel non appareant, vel obscure appareant, vel alia loco priorum successerunt, sciunt quod aliquid mali fecerint, quod illi apud se examinant, et explorant, et inde inveniant suum malum, et poenitentiam agant: quod cum factum redit prior aspectus, et si meliores facti quam prius, tunc meliores aspectus sunt. Imprimis tum explorant tale ex faciebus illorum. </p>
