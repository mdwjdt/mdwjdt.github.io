<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>430.有些人有耶稣与他们同在，并因此而相信。在离我今天所在的气场，也就是灵人的气场很远的地方，有许多人出现，聚集到一处，声称他们有耶稣与他们同在，并且天天看见祂；他们是那些有得救之信的人。在这些人对面或下面也有许多人，他们也声称他们有基督与他们同在；他们有基于理解力的得救之信。因此，在圣言中，前者由亚伯拉罕和以撒来代表；而离他们很远的后者则由亚比米勒来代表。因为亚比米勒在立约之后离开了亚伯拉罕和以撒（创世记21:32，26:31，参看AC 3004-3011）。（1747年12月30日）</p>

There are some who have Jesus with them, and therefore believe<p>At a great distance from the realm (that is, the realm of spirits) in which I was today, there were many gathered into one, who appeared, and said that they had Jesus with them, and saw Him daily; and they are those who have saving belief.<p>Opposite to them, or below, there were likewise many, who were also saying that they had Christ with them; and they have saving belief based on understanding.<p>Thus the former are portrayed in the Word by Abraham and Isaac, but the latter, who were at a distance from them, by Abimelech. For Abimelech departed from Abraham and Isaac after the covenant had been ratified [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_32.htm">Gen. 21:32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_26_31.htm">26:31</a>]. <sup16_11747">11747</sup>, the 30th day of December.<p><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3004.htm">AC 3004-3011</a> </p>

THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE JESUS WITH THEM, AND THEY SO BELIEVE <p>There were many at a great distance from the sphere in which I have been today or from the sphere of spirits, who appeared gathered together into one place, and they said that they had Jesus with them, and saw Him daily: these are they who are in saving faith. Opposite to them, or beneath, there were likewise many who also said that they had Christ with them: they are of intellectual saving faith. The former are thus represented in the Word by Abraham and Isaac, but the latter, who were at a distance, by Abimelech; for Abimelech departed from Abraham and Isaac after their covenant was ratified.
