<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1462</h4><p>1462. These things seem to refer to the educated, who are superficial people, and who grasp and teach only outward matters and thus insist on the literal [meaning of the Word], explaining it according to their own mind. They now take it literally, now inwardly, thus distorting, and using both meanings to support their opinions.<p>Such people seem to be meant here, who pursue the inward and very inward meaning of the Word, especially those who consider themselves more educated than the rest, despising others in comparison with themselves, and who are likewise arrogant, coveting things of the body and the world. It appears to mean that these pursued him who portrays the inward meaning.<p>Whether something of this kind will redound on the doctrine, I do not yet know. At least I know that the uneducated do not do this. 1748, 16, 17 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1462</h4><p>1462. These things seem to signify that the learned who are exterior men apprehend and teach nothing but exterior things. Thus they insist upon the literal expressions which they explain according to their own bias, at one time taking exterior, at another interior things, and thus distorting and making use of either sense so as to bend it to their own opinions. The persons who seem to be understood here are they who persecute the interior and more interior sense of the Word, especially they who consider themselves more learned than others. They despise others in comparison with themselves and at the same time are proud, and they desire the things of the body and the world. That such spirits persecuted him who represented the interior sense is what seems to be signified. Whether any such thing will again flow into the doctrine, I do not as yet know; at least the unlearned do not act in this way. 1748, Mar. 16, 17. </p>
