<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5942</h4><p>5942. About Inflow<p>I perceived an inflow at one time of sadness, at another of cheerfulness, and other [feelings], and I perceived that there were lower spirits who were exploring what saddens me and were speaking about these things among themselves, except that I heard [what they were saying], And as a result what had been unpleasant to me earlier, I [now] felt in myself as unpleasant, and so on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5942</h4><p>5942. INFLUX. <p>I have perceived, with others as well [as myself], an influx sometimes of sadness, at others of cheerfulness; and have perceived that there were spirits beneath, who sought out whatever of sadness is with me, and spoke of those things to each other. Moreover, I have heard it. And hence the undelightfulness that was with me formerly, was perceived in me as undelightful [at these times]; and so forth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5942 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5942. De Influxu<p>Percepi influxum nunc tristitiae, nunc hilaritatis, et alios, et percepi quod essent spiritus inferius, qui explorarunt quid mihi tristitiae est, et de iis inter se loquuti sint, praeter quod audiverim, et inde quod mihi prius injucundum fuit, perceptum in me ut injucundum, et sic porro. </p>
