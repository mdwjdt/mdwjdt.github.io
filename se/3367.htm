<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3367</h4><p>3367. While they were operating at that halfway point of the rock, there was heard a constant drilling sound, as though very many large drills were at work, and only the crude sound of them was heard. That sound spread out not only toward me but to a great distance from me toward the right, where those good spirits still were, thus far away at a great distance, so that they might talk with me. So the arrangement of the grand man in the world of spirits seemed to have been changed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3367</h4><p>3367. (When they operated in that middle distance of the rock, then there was continually perceived a sound of boring, as if very many large augers [terebroe] were operating, and only the rough [rudis] sound of such things was heard. This sound not only flowed [effundebat se] forth to me, but to a considerable distance from me, on the right hand, where at that time were good spirits thus were removed to a considerable distance so that they might speak with me; thus was the constitution of the Grand Man changed, as it were, in the world of spirits.) </p>

Cum operabantur in media ista distantia petrae, tunc perceptus continue erat sonus terebrosus, sicut permultae terebrae magnae operarentuu, et solum sonus rudis talium audiretur <sup>1</sup></p><p>, qui sonus non solum ad me sed ad multam distantiam a me dextrorsum se effundebat, ubi tunc erant spiritus isti boni, sic remoti ad multam distantiam, ut mecum loquerentur, ita quasi mutata esset constitutio magni hominis <sup>2</sup></p><p>in mundo spirituum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
