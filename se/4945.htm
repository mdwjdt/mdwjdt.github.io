<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4945</h4><p>4945. The other city was not sinking but was transferred to another place. This was going on for a considerable distance. The transfer at the time took a circuitous route and looked like a cloud being borne along, and when it reached its destination, it too sank down in that way in another place. Before it was transferred, all who were in it were struck with a certain type of stupor, for there was a general change of state. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4945</h4><p>4945. The other city did not sink down, but was transferred to another place which was at quite a remarkable distance. The removal then proceeded in a circuit, and it appeared as though a cloud was transferred; and when it came to its destination, it likewise sank down in this place, in the manner already related. Before it was transferred, all who were in it were put into a sort of stupor; for there was a general change of state. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4945 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4945. Altera urbs non subsidebat, sed translata est ad alium locum, quod fiebat ad insignem satis distantiam, pergebat tunc translatio in circuitu, et apparuit sicut nubes transferretur, et cum ad finem perventum est, subsidebat etiam ita alibi. Antequam transferebatur, omnes qui inibi in quandam stuporis speciem acti sunt, nam erat status mutatio generalis. </p>
