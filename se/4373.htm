<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4373</h4><p>4373. The arts of sirens<p>Upon exploration as to how sirens operate besides by filthy sorcery, it was found that they steal into the feelings, taking from a feeling whatever they think they can benefit by. This they imitate like monkeys, and this again and again, so that if someone were with a friend whom he liked, then in order to destroy the friendship, they take hold of his affection itself toward the friend. Feelings all vary according to the persons concerned, and this spontaneously depending on the states of mind that are in some way known to them, or can be inferred from a known one. These qualities they take on, and indeed, one after another, and copy so as to impersonate him and to destroy the other, thus employing innumerable methods. This is their nature, like that of monkeys, and they delight in this behavior, wandering all around like a band of tartars. 1749, 24 Aug. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Saturn, meaning Saturday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4373</h4><p>4373. THE ARTS OF SIRENS.<p>Besides the vile magical arts of sirens it was found upon exploring them that they work by insinuating themselves into affections, and taking thence what they think they can turn to account, they act feignedly with it like apes, and that again and again, so that if they would destroy the friendship which subsists between an individual and one whom he loves, they will seize hold of that very affection to accomplish it. These affections are then varied by them according to the persons they would represent, and this very naturally in accordance with the states that are in any way known to them, or such as may be inferred from what are known. These semblances they will assume, one after another, and act one person so as to destroy another, and that by innumerable modes. Their very nature is that of apes; their delight is in these deceitful arts, and they wander about everywhere as a lawless multitude. - 1749, August 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4373 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4373. Sirenum artes<p>Exploratum quomodo agunt sirenes praeter spurca magica, quod insinuent se in affectiones, sumunt ex affectione quod iis prodesse putant, hoc fingunt sicut simiae, et hoc iterum et iterum, ut si quis cum amico esset quem amaret, ut destruant amicitias, captant ipsam ejus affectionem erga eum, affectiones variantur omnes secundum personas, et hoc naturaliter secundum ejus status qui noti sunt aliquo modo, aut sequuntur ex noto; haec desumunt, et quidem unum post alium, et effingunt, ut agere possint ejus personam, et alterum perdere; ita innumeris modis, natura eorum talis est, qualis simiae, in his delectantur, sic vagantur sicut turba tartarica circumcircum. 1749, Aug. </p>
