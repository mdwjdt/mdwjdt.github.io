<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4095</h4><p>4095. On the inflow of life from the Lord, and His Providence in the very least things<p>When I was writing about the Lord's inflow and of His Providence in the very least things, I realized more clearly than ever before, and confirmed by various considerations, that this is the case, and that it cannot possibly be otherwise, even if thousands of arguments should fallaciously affirm the contrary, but to expound all of them would be too much; therefore it is preferable to believe. 1748, 28 Nov.</p><p>[2] For since angelic mental imagery embraces innumerably many details, in such a way that there only appears to be one general something, and since it is figurative and parabolic, from which innumerable details emerge, it is then received according to the states of conviction and passion of the receiver - seven things opposite, depending upon the states of reception, also things in between, so that almost all things can be displayed from an angelic mental image containing so innumerably many details. What then can be said of the life of the Lord, in which is the Infinite - so that nothing can ever be lacking in anyone to prevent them from receiving mental imagery from that source? - and what especially of His mercy, which extends itself to all aspects of love, and all of faith? - so they are received by the corrupt in an opposite manner, with countless variety.<p>4095. 1/2. Since the mental imagery of one person speaking, while a thousand are listening, is received in diverse ways, even though it is at the same level - then what about inward mental imagery, which compared to outer imagery contains details beyond number; and since inward imagery comes forth from very inward imagery, containing comparatively still more countless details; and these from innermost imagery - and since all of these are finite in number, then what can be said of the Lord, Who is Infinite, in comparison to Whom every one of countless innermost details is as nothing, and so on? 1748, 28 Nov.<p>Consider the Divine, to Whom all the very least things are in the present from eternity, whether anything can exist that is not accessible to everyone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4095</h4><p>4095. CONCERNING THE INFLUX OF LIFE FROM THE LORD, AND HIS PROVIDENCE IN THE MINUTEST PARTICULARS.<p>While writing concerning the influx of the Lord's life and of His Providence into the most particular things, it was perceived more clearly than on any former occasion, and confirmed in various ways, that the fact is so, and that it cannot possibly be otherwise, notwithstanding that thousands of fallacious arguments should affirm the contrary. But it would be too much to attempt to explain the whole subject; wherefore it is better simply to believe. - 1748, November 28. The generals [communia] of an angelic idea contain such innumerable co-existing particulars, that they appear only as one general something; and these ideas may be representative and parabolic, from which are innumerable results. These ideas are then received according to the recipient's state of persuasion and cupidities, thence also their contraries according as the states of the recipient may be; then likewise the intermediates; thus nearly everything may be presented from an angelic idea, which contains things thus innumerable. What then shall be said of the life of the Lord, in which is the Infinite, so that nothing can ever be wanting in anyone to prevent his thence receiving ideas? What especially shall be said of His mercy, which extends itself to all things of love and all things of faith? By the perverse they are also received in a contrary manner with indefinite diversity.<p>4095. 1-2. Since the ideas of one man speaking, while a thousand hear, are diversely received, though still in the same degree, how much more does this hold of interior ideas, which, in comparison with exterior, contain indefinite particulars? And as interior ideas exist from more interior, which in respect to the former contain still more indefinite things, and as these are from inmost ideas, all which are yet finite, what shall be said of the Lord who is Infinite, and in respect to whom every indefinite inmost is as nothing and so on? - 1748, November 28. Just consider the Divine, to whom all the most singular things are present from eternity, and see whether anything can be conceived which may not be made to be present to anyone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4095 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4095. De influxu vitae a Domino, et Providentia Ipsius in singularissimis.<p>Cum scriberem de influxu vitae Domini et Providentiae Ipsius in singularissima, perceptum manifestius quam alioquin, et confirmatum variis, quod ita prorsus se habeat, et quod nunquam aliter sit, tametsi millia ratiocinationum, propter fallacias, aliud sistant, sed omnia exponere foret permultum; quare praestat credere. 1748, 28 Nov. Cum enim ideae angelicae tam innumerabilia simul comprehendunt, ut modo sicut commune quoddam appareat, et sint repraesentativae, et parabolicae, ex quibus innumerabilia - tum eae secundum recipientium status persuasionis et cupiditatum recipiuntur, etiam contraria inde, sicut status recipientes sunt, tum intermedia, ita fere omnia sisti possint ab idea angelica, quae tam innumerabilia continet - quid non vita Domini, in qua est Infinitum? sic ut nihil usquam sit, quod deficere possit in unoquovis, quin inde recipiat ideas, et imprimis misericordia Ipsius, quae se extendit ad omnia amoris, et omnia fidei, sic recipiuntur a perversis contrario modo indefinita diversitate.<p>4095b. Cum ideae unius hominis loquentis, dum mille audiunt, diversimode recipiuntur, quae tamen sunt in eodem gradu, quomodo non ideae interiores, quae respective ad exteriores indefinita continent? et cum ideae interiores existunt ab intimioribus, quae adhuc indefinita continent respective, et haec ab intimis, quae tamen omnia sunt finita, quid non Dominus, Qui Infinitus, Cujus respectu ut nihil est, omne indefinitum intimum? et sic porro. 1748, 28 Nov. Considera modo Divinum, Cui in praesenti sunt singularissima ab aeterno, an quicquam dari queat, quod non sistatur unicuivis. </p>
