<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2260</h4><p>2260. About the Jews<p>I heard someone speaking about the Jews, saying that they are a nation entirely different from other nations, and that it is ingrained in them to try to break down and corrupt everything of society, in small matters as well as great. Whenever the opportunity arises, they mix in, and they find nothing more enjoyable than to break down the laws of order, those of society. The reason for this is the hatred they have acquired against Love and Order Itself, Which is the Lord. Such are their chief goals. And I know these things from being taught by much, in fact two years', experience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2260</h4><p>2260. CONCERNING THE JEWS. <p>I heard someone speaking of the Jews, that it is such a nation as to be wholly different from other nations, and that it is innate [insitum] in that people [e. i.] to attempt to destroy and pervert whatever belongs to society, even in small as in great things, for wherever the occasion is furnished they intermix themselves, and have not a greater delight in anything else than in destroying the laws of order, that is, the laws of society. The reason is [that they] have taken up hatred against love and order itself which is the Lord; and that their heads are such. These things also I do know, having been instructed by much experience, in fact, that of two years. - 1748, June 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2260 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2260. De Judaeis<p>Audivi aliquem loquentem de Judaeis, quod talis natio sit, quae prorsus ab aliis nationibus diversa, eique insitum, ut quicquid societatis <sup>1</sup></p><p>est, destruere et pervertere conentur, etiam in parvis sicut in magnis, nam ubicunque datur occasio, se intermiscent, nec in alio majorem delectationem habent, quam ut ordinis leges, hoc est, societatis leges destruant, causa est, odium acquisitum contra Ipsum Amorem et Ordinem, Qui est Dominus; et quod capita eorum talia sint: haec quoque ex multa, et quidem 2 annorum experientia instructus scio. 1748, 9 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has socitatis </p>
