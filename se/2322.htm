<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2322</h4><p>2322. So that I might know this by actual, sensate experience, a condition was brought upon me by the Lord whereby I would have some sort of perception as if innumerable beings were endeavoring and acting. It kept on for more than an hour, if not for two, during which time I was clearly seeing how the most minute details were proceeding in their right order, so that not one spirit among so many, whom I saw as if beyond number, could even open his mouth or do the least thing, except in that series and in that order that pleased the Lord. All details were so clear, and proceeded that clearly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2322</h4><p>2322. That this might be known by living experience, and to the perception, such a state was induced by the Lord, as that there might be a certain perception, as it were, of innumerable [persons] who endeavored and acted. This lasted over an hour, if not for two hours; and meanwhile it was plainly perceived how the minutest things proceeded in their order, so that among so many who were, as it were, perceived by me to be innumerable, not even one could have hissed, or do the least thing, save in that series and that order which suited the Lord's good pleasure, all things were so distinct, and proceeded distinctly; a most manifest proof that the Lord rules the universe, than which I have not yet perceived a more manifest one. Likewise, also, certain spirits who are around me confess it, and yet such is the state of the spiritual world, that if a single spirit thinks otherwise than in his order, straightway his neighbors, and so forth, are thereby disturbed for so many are the objects of their thoughts, and so many the causes of excitement [excitamenta] of their endeavors [conatuum], and forces, and cupidities, which nevertheless were now held, as it were, suspended and restrained so that nothing could be excited by one that could disturb the series of thoughts of any [other] one. - 1748, June 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2322 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2322. Hoc ut per experientiam vivam, adque perceptionem sciretur, a Domino talis status inducebatur, ut quaedam perceptio esset quasi innumerabilium conantium et agentium, quod persistebat ultra horam, si non bihorium; ac interea manifeste percipiebatur, quomodo minutissima suo ordine procederent, sic ut unus, inter tot, qui innumerabiles mihi quasi percepti, ne quidem hiscere, aut minimum agere potuisset, nisi in ea serie, et in eo ordine, quo beneplacuit Domino, omnia ita distincta erant, et distincte procedebant;<p>(2323.) manifestissimum indicium, quod Dominus regat universum, quo manifestius, nondum percepi; sicut etiam fatentur quidam spiritus, qui circum me. Cum tamen talis status est mundi spiritualis, ut si unus spiritus cogitat aliter ac in ordine, quod illico vicini, et sic porro, inde disturbentur, nam totidem sunt objecta eorum cogitationum, et totidem excitamenta eorum conatuum, virium, et cupiditatum, quae tamen nunc quasi suspensa tenebantur, et coercita, ut nihil ab uno excitari potuit, quod turbaret cujusdam <sup>1</sup></p><p>seriem cogitationum. 1748, 13 Junius.<p>2323a. <sup>1</sup></p><p>In mundo spirituum, cumprimis animarum, quandoque iis datur licentia, et solvitur quasi vinculum, sic ut cupiditatibus eorum relaxetur fraenum, raro autem falsitatibus; tunc putant ii, quod ea {a} se longe et quidem per universum coelum extenderet, et turbaret non solum totum mundum spirituum, sed etiam coelos; sed est fallacia sensus, sphaera activitatis eorum, non procul se extendit, illico desinit, ad paucam peripheriam quasi, nam tale est aequilibrium, ut ita loquar, ut sistatur illico, si vel maxima turba apparens; quod satis constare potest ab humano genere, quod turba maxima penes quosdam, non late se extendat, et usque reguntur omnes per spiritus mundi spirituum. 1748, 13 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has cujusdem<p>1.&nbsp;sic in the Manuscript bis 2323. </p>
