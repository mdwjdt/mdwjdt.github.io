<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5651</h4><p>5651. After the visitation was made on those mountains that were more toward the north, where those were who are from lower Italy, they were found to be such that when left to their inner nature they went entirely into idolatrous worship and made idols of various kinds for themselves of such things that are in the sea, on land, and in the sky, and began to worship these, saying that the ancients on earth had done so, and also gentiles with whom it is well, and these had learned from experience which idol's worship was the more successful, and what was successful they preferred. So that promiscuous gang worshiped idols of such kinds, fashioned entirely on the model of all things that are in the sea, on land, and in the sky, and animals of various kinds, birds, fishes, snakes, an image of the moon and of the sun, and so on. They even left out the saints they had worshiped in the world, having learned from experience that these were of no help. Such worship is innate in them from the worship of images on earth. Therefore when it was found that they were idolaters, entirely worse than idolaters on earth in that they had denied the Divine and had believed that such things were of help, because [they worked] through correspondences, then the last judgment came on those mountains; in fact, there was first an earthquake which appeared like an enormous wave in the sea, and then the cities there and the palaces there were shaken, and they collapsed. After this happened, the mountain was overturned, thus swelling over them, and they were thus entirely carried away off the face of the earth. How deeply they were cast down it was not granted to know. (Concerning their inquisition see the other page.) <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Following the author's instruction we have transposed <a href="5656.htm">5656</a>, the other page, here.<p>5656. They are in the habit of treating everyone they come across in the following way. With their cunning art they are able to lead whomever they see to themselves and make him present with them, however much he resists; and then they uncover his evils, because evil spirits can do this, especially sirens, and so they accuse and condemn him to hell. If he is not then driven to accepting their worship, either the worship of the Devil or on the other hand acting hypocritically holy, they hurl them into dusky caves around their mountain. Nevertheless, they are taken out by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5651</h4><p>5651. After this, visitation was made upon those who were more towards the north, where those were who are from lower Italy; and it was found, that, when left to their interiors, they betook themselves wholly to idolatrous worship, and made themselves idols of various kinds from such things as are in the sea, on earth and in heaven, and began to worship them, saying that the ancients on earth did so, and gentiles also with whom it is well and proved, by various kinds of worships, the idol the worship of which was the more successful, and that which was successful, chose. Thus the mixed multitude worshipped idols of such kinds, and made entirely after the pattern of all things which are in the sea, earth and heaven; and animals of various kinds; birds, fishes, serpents; representations of the moon and of the sun; and so forth. They also passed by the saints, whom they worshipped in the world, having proved that they are of no use. Such worship is ingrained in them, from the worship of images on earth. When, therefore, it was found that they were complete idolaters - worse than the idolaters on earth, in respect to the fact that they have denied the Divine and believe that such things avail, because through correspondences, - then, the Last Judgment came upon those mountains. Some, an earthquake first fell upon, which appeared like vast billows of the sea; and then, the towns there were shattered, and the palaces there, and fell to the ground; which being done, the mountainous [surrounding] was rolled back, thus moving to and fro over them; and so they were altogether carried off from the face of the earth. It is not granted to know whither they have been deeply cast down. (# About their inquisition see another page; [no. <a href="../se/5656.htm">5656</a>, which we here immediately subjoin].) </p>

Postea visitatio facta est super illos montes qui versus septentrionem magis, ubi illi qui ab inferiori Italia, et illi inventi quod cum relicti interioribus suis, prorsus ad cultum idololatricum se contulerint, et fecerint sibi idola varii generis, ex talibus quae in mari, in terra, et in coelo, et illa coeperunt colere, dicentes quod antiqui in tellure ita fecerint, et gentiles quoque quibus bene est, et experti per varios cultus, cujusnam idoli cultus succederet magis, et quod successit, praetulerunt, ita promiscua turba colebat idola, talium generum, et prorsus facta secundum imaginem omnium quae in mari, terra et coelo, et animalia varii generis, aves, pisces, serpentes, instar lunae et solis, et sic porro, praeterierunt etiam sanctos, quos coluerunt in mundo, experti quod nihil juvarent; cultus talis innatus est illis, ex cultu imaginum in terra; cum itaque inventum quod prorsus idololatrae essent pejores idololatris in terra, in eo quod negaverint Divinum, et crediderint quod talia juvarent, quia per correspondentias, tunc venit ultimum judicium super illos montes quidem occupavit primum terrae motus, qui apparebat sicut ingentes fluctus maris, et tunc concussae sunt urbes ibi, et palatia ibi, et corruerunt, quo facto revolvebatur montanum sic fluctuans super illos, et illi sic prorsus a facie terrae sublati, quo profunde dejecti sunt, non scire datum est.
