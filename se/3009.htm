<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3009</h4><p>3009. The reason why people's fantasies are turned in the other life into the shapes of animals and the like<p>The reason was slipped into my mind why many fantasies in the life of the body are turned into the shapes of animals and many like things: when they are examined from the heavens, or when heaven flows in, then, no differently than in the world of spirits, as we see in prophetical passages, and in dreams, they are turned into such animals and into such shapes as are the lowest in the order, like those on earth that portray the lowest things-as when the witch was examined and turned into a snakey ball [<a href="232.htm">232</a>]. For the correspondences are such that it cannot be otherwise, when they are carried through the order from bodily life, which remains, and thus farther upwards, but that their fantasies should appear in this way. Otherwise the fantasies cannot be taken away, and they themselves reformed. 1748, 31 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3009</h4><p>3009. THE REASON THAT THE PHANTASIES OF MEN ARE, IN THE OTHER LIFE, TURNED INTO SPECIES OF ANIMALS, AND THE LIKE. <p>There was insinuated into me the reason why many phantasies, in the life of the body, are turned into forms of animals, and of many similar things, [so] that when they are inspected from the heavens, or there is influx, then [these phantasies] are turned into such animals and such forms, not different from what occurs in the world of spirits, [and] like as appears, from prophetics, and in sleep. (They are turned into such forms) as are the ultimates of order; such as also [exist] in the earth, and are the ultimates of representations. For instance [sicut], when a sorceress being inspected, was turned into a ball of serpents [glomum serpentinum]; for correspondences are such that it cannot be otherwise, than what when borne through order from a corporeal life, which remains, and so still upwards that in the beginning their phantasies so appear, otherwise, phantasies cannot be taken from them, and they reformed. - 1748, August 31. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3009 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3009. Causa quod phantasiae hominum in altera vita in species animalium, et similia vertantur<p>Causa mihi insinuata est, quod phantasiae plures in vita corporis vertantur in formas <sup>1</sup></p><p>animalium et plurium similium, [nempe] quod cum e coelis inspiciuntur <sup>2</sup></p><p>, vel influit [coelum], tunc non aliter ac in mundo spirituum, sicut a propheticis apparet, et in somniis <sup>3</sup></p><p>, in talia animalia et in tales formas vertantur, quae sunt ultima ordinis, qualia quoque in tellure, quae sunt ultima repraesentationum; sicut dum praestigiatrix inspecta in glomum serpentinum versa est [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3009/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_232" target=_top>232</a>], nam correspondentiae tales sunt, ut non possit aliter, quam dum feruntur per ordinem a vita corporea, quae remanet sic sursum magis, quod principio phantasiae eorum appareant tales; alioquin non possunt phantasiae iis adimi ii reformari. 1748, 31 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has inspeiuntur<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has somnis </p>
