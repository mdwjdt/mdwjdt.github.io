<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4789</h4><p>4789. When I awoke, it came to me that it was Bonoschold, and the marshy pool was his nature acquired in the world. The quality of this nature was also shown by a spiritual mental image. It was such that he valued people only according to profit, and not according to his or her merits, or rather, not putting life ahead of other considerations. On the contrary, he was often disposed to prefer and to praise those from whom he had profited or could have profited, and he insultingly attacked those from whom he had not or could not get a profit. Such was his disposition and nature. Consequently he was utterly foolish, believing that the world was everything. This marshy place is in the other life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4789</h4><p>4789. When I awaked, it was then granted me to know that it was Boneauschold, and that the marshy pond was his nature, which he acquired to himself in the world. It was also shown, by a spiritual idea, of what quality that nature was. It was such that he thought about men only in reference to his advantage, and not in reference to their merit, or superiority of life above others; but, in his mind, he frequently preferred and praised him from whom he received, or might be able to receive, gain, and slandered him from whom he did not, or could not, get gain. Such was his mind and nature. Hence he was quite silly, believing that the world was everything. This is the marshy place in the other life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4789 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4789. Cum evigilatus sum, tunc scire dabatur quod esset Bonöschöld, et quod paludinosum stagnum esset ejus natura quam sibi acquisivit in mundo, natura illa etiam ostensa est qualis esset per ideam spiritualem; erat talis, ut de hominibus cogitaret solum secundum lucrum, et non secundum ejus meritum aut vitae praeferentiam prae aliis, sed animo saepe praetulit illum, et laudavit, a quo lucrum accepit vel accipere posset, et vituperabat illum a quo non lucrum captavit vel captare posset, talis fuit animus et natura ejus, inde prorsus insipiens, credens quod mundus esset omne, hoc paludinosum est in altera vita. </p>
