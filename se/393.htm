<p>393.他们因着频繁的杀戮和攻击而厌倦了这种生活之后，便进入一种更好的状态，以致他们觉得自己似乎在人体中；但他们的脸是猴子或类人猿的脸，可以前后转动，他们因此能环顾四周，以免受到他们所逃避的敌人的伤害。然后，他们住在美丽的房子里，就像小宫殿一样；他们在这种生活中度过他们的时光之后，就消失了，因为他们完成了洁净，完全忘记了他们以前在世上的生活，从而忘记他们的偶像崇拜；他们还接受教导，从而得以更新。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 393</h4><p>393. After they have become disgusted with this life of repeated lacerations and attacks, then they are transferred into a better condition, and indeed, as it seems to them, into human bodies, but having faces of monkeys or apes, which they can turn forward or backward, and thus look all around them to see that no harm befalls them from their enemies, whom they had fled. Then they live in beautiful houses, like small palaces, and after they have passed through this life, they vanish, because their purging is then completed and they have entirely forgotten their former life in the world, thus their idol worship, and they are instructed, then renewed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 393</h4><p>393. After they have became wearied with that life, from the frequent butcheries and infestations, they are then transmitted into a better state, so that they seem to themselves to be in human bodies, indeed, but their faces are those of monkeys or apes [singarum vel apinior], which can be turned forwards and backwards, and thus they can look around them lest any injury should happen to them from the enemies from whom they flee. They then inhabit beautiful houses and as it were little palaces: and after they have passed their time in this kind of life, they vanish, for their vastation is then completed, and they entirely forget their former life in the world, thus their idolatry; and they are also instructed and thus renewed. </p>
