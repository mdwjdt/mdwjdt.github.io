<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2295</h4><p>2295. Mental images are perceived with complete variety<p>There was something I said that certain spirits afterwards said was not as good as they imagined, but I was prompted to reply that it is never possible for everyone to take in the idea of another in the same way, but everyone perceives it according to their own character. So one person never grasps an idea, or the sense of ideas, in the same way as another, but each person receives it according to his or her own character, and some cannot grasp at all, due to their character, anything cheerful and good that the thought contained. They judge it from their own qualities. For in a single mental image there are countless elements, all of which are understood according to the quality of the receiver. There are both general elements and fine details, there are inward elements, and more inward ones.<p>This [difference of reception] was shown to me in an instant, when certain spirits were present from among those who like to punish, and when they began, I portrayed feathers in their hands, then palm branches, and they immediately said, "What are we holding in our hands? only twigs, having no leaves." This happened so that I would learn how mental images are diversely received, according to characters. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2295</h4><p>2295. THAT IDEAS ARE PERCEIVED WITH ALL VARIETY. <p>Something was said by me, which certain spirits afterwards said was not so good as they imagined; but it was given me to reply that it can never happen that one perceives similarly the idea of another; everyone [perceives] according to his disposition, so that the same idea or sense of ideas is never received by one like as by another, as also that everyone receives according to his disposition, and some cannot, because of such quality, [perceive] what there was cheerful and good in the idea; thus they conclude from their own [ideas], for in a single idea are indefinite things; therefore they perceive [each] according to the quality of him who receives. Such is the case with regard to generals as well as singulars, interiors as well as more interior things. This was forthwith shown me. [There were] certain spirits among them who desire to punish, and when they began, I represented plumes in their hands, then palms; they immediately said that we hold in our hands only rods, that is, without leaves, which was done that I might know how ideas are received according to different dispositions. - 1748, June 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2295 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2295. Quod ideae percipiantur cum omni varietate<p>Quoddam a me dictum erat, quod quidam spiritus dicebant postea, quod non ita hoc bonum, sicut autumabant, sed respondere mihi dabatur, quod nusquam ita esse possit, ut unus similiter ideam alterius percipiat, [sed] quisque secundum suam indolem, sic ut una idea, vel sensus idearum, nusquam similiter recipiatur ab uno sicut ab altero, tum quod quisque secundum suam indolem recipit, et quidam non possunt [percipere], quia tales, quid laeti bonique in idea fuit, ita ex suis concludunt, nam in una idea indefinita sunt, quare percipiuntur <sup>1</sup></p><p>secundum qualitatem ejus qui recipit-sunt <sup>2</sup></p><p>tam communia, quam singularia, tum interiora ac intimiora-quod <sup>3</sup></p><p>illico mihi ostensum: quidam spiritus inter eos [erant], qui punire cupiunt, cumque inciperent, repraesentabam in manibus eorum plumas, mox palmas, ii illico dicebant, "quid tenemus in manibus? modo virgas, nempe absque foliis," quod factum, ut scirem, quomodo ideae recipiuntur secundum diversas indoles. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
