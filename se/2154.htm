<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2154</h4><p>2154. About the inward memory, and its influence on the outward memory.<p>Here it is permitted only to make note of this, that there is an inward memory of such a nature that all and the least details are written on it that a person has done, spoken or thought, and a more inward memory, which could better be called the character. Even the minutest components of ideas are there. So there is not the least thing that a person has thought from earliest childhood to the last moment of life that is not as it were written down on it and preserved. A person on earth may hardly be able to believe this, being acquainted only with the bodily memory. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2154</h4><p>2154. CONCERNING THE INTERIOR MEMORY, AND ITS INFLUX INTO THE EXTERIOR MEMORY. <p>This only it may be proper to notice concerning these, that there is such an interior memory as has therein inscribed each and all that man has done, spoken, and thought, and a more interior memory which should rather be called a disposition; also the minutest elements of the ideas are there, so that there is nothing at all, which man has thought from earliest infancy to the last of life, that is not, as it were, inscribed or retained there. Man can scarce credit this, because he possesses only the knowledge of the corporeal memory. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2154 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2154. De memoria interiori, ejusque influxu in memoriam exteriorem<p>Hoc solum hic liceat annotare, quod talis sit memoria interior, ut ei inscripta sint omnia et singula, quae homo egit, loquutus et cogitavit, et memoria intimior, quae potius indoles dicenda, etiam ibi idearum minutissima, sic ut ne hilum sit, quod homo cogitaverit a prima infantia ad ultimum vitae, quod non ibi sit, quasi inscriptum, seu retentum, quod vix homo possit credere, quia solum memoriae corporeae cognitionem habet. </p>
