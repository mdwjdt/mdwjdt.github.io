<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4507</h4><p>4507. About magical arts<p>There are female magicians, both of modern times and of antiquity, toward the front and toward the left side in the hell under the earth. Some of these, called forth from there, appeared toward the front up above toward the left side, and spoke. The speech that remained with them was almost a monotone, like the sound of a flute, but stronger. They admitted that they had been magicians, and that they have little of life remaining. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4507</h4><p>4507. CONCERNING THINGS MAGICAL.<p>There are female magicians or witches, some of modern and some of ancient times, in front at the left, in a hell under the earth. Some of them being called forth thence, they appeared in front, above, to the left, and spoke. The speech of their residuum was almost monotonous, like the deeper notes of a flute; they confessed that they were of the character above mentioned, and that they have little of life left. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4507 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4507. De magicis<p>Sunt magae, tam hodiernae quaedam, quam antiquae antrorsum ad sinistrum in inferno sub terra, inde quaedam evocatae apparuerunt antrorsum superne ad sinistrum, et loquutae, loquela residua earum erat unius fere toni, sicut tibialis sed major, confessae sunt quod tales fuerunt, et quod parum vitae residuum habeant. </p>
