<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3478</h4><p>3478. Certain corporeal spirits when they were in that fantasy said they could not conceive of time from eternity, for while they conceive of an eternity to come, in the sense that there may be no end of time, thus time without end, they do not conceive of time from eternity; and when they stretch their reasoning in that direction, then they fall into such absurdities. Hence the naturalists confirm themselves to the utmost [in the idea] that nature is God, and God came forth from nature. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3478</h4><p>3478. Some corporeal spirits, when they were in such a phantasy, were unable to perceive time from eternity. They could indeed perceive an eternity to come from this, that there is no end of time, and that thus it is time without end; but time from eternity [past] they do not conceive; and when their reasonings extend in that direction, they fall into such absurdities; whence the naturalists confirm themselves to the utmost that nature is God, and God from nature. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"Men cannot but confound the Divine Infinity with infinity of space; and as they cannot conceive of the infinity of space as being other than a mere nothing, as it really is, they disbelieve the Divine Infinity. The case is similar in respect to eternity, which men cannot conceive of otherwise than as eternity of time, it being presented to the mind under the idea of time with those who are in time. The real idea of the Divine Infinity is insinuated into the angels by this, that in an instant they are present under the Lord's view, even from the farthest extremity of the universe, without intervening space or time. The real idea of the Divine Eternity is insinuated into them by this, that thousands of years do not appear to them as time, but scarce otherwise than as if the had lived a minute. Both ideas are insinuated into them by this, that in their NOW they have together things past and future; hence they have no solitude about things to come, nor have they ever any idea of death, but only an idea of life: thus in all their NOW there is the Eternity and Infinity of the Lord." - AC 1382. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3478 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3478. Quidam corporei spiritus cum essent in ea phantasia [dicebant], quod tempus ab aeterno non percipere possent, nam quod aeternum venturum hoc percipiunt ab eo quod nullus sit finis temporis, sic quod tempus absque fine; sed quod tempus ab aeterno non concipiunt, et cum ratiocinia extendunt illuc, tunc cadunt in tales absurditates, inde confirmant se naturalistae quam maxime, quod natura sit Deus, et ex natura Deus. </p>
