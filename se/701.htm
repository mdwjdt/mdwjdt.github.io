<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 701</h4><p>701. After these events, they were introduced into the inward heaven, <sup>1</sup>as I was told by a clear voice saying that they were admitted in this way when they had been in the heaven of spirits for a certain length of time. Therefore no one more could be let in, however much they cried out and insisted. This is what is meant by those who had come too late, because they had lacked oil in their lamps. They received the reply that they could no longer be admitted, whereupon they were turned away.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262 and footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 701</h4><p>701. After these things, they were introduced into the interior heaven. It was told me in a distinct voice that in this manner they were admitted after they have been in the heaven of spirits for some time. Thus no one further could be admitted, howsoever they might cry out and desire it. By this is signified those who came too late, because they lacked oil in their lamps. Reply was made that they can no longer be admitted; therefore they were then rejected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 701 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>701. Post haec introducebantur hi in coelum interius, quod mihi clara voce dicebatur, quod sic admitterentur, quando fuerint in coelo spirituum per aliquantum tempus, sic nemo amplius potuit intromitti, quamvis clamarent et vellent, per haec significantur ii qui serius venerunt, quia defecerat oleum in lampadibus; responsum tulerunt quod non amplius admitti possint, ideo tunc erant rejecti. </p>
