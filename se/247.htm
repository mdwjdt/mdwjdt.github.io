<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第247节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>247.一些口头宣称怜悯和神圣的灵人的极端残忍。今夜，有极为残忍的事被展现给我；人若稍微察觉一点点，必不寒而栗。所以我想在提到它的时候放过纯洁的眼睛和耳朵。某些灵人向弥赛亚神呼求怜悯，他们唯独为自己索要怜悯。由于一些微不足道的原因，如我向他们所解释的，他们似乎想为了报复而向纯真本身下最残忍的手；不过，是以那些以为他们通过幻想所想起的东西真实存在的灵人的方式。他们就这样做出完全违反怜悯的事；但谁都能判断出他们是否有怜悯和仁爱，因为他们自己做出违反怜悯和仁爱的事，只是为了报复纯真，而不是报复邪恶，或出于好的动机。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 247</h4><p>247. The extreme cruelty of some who nevertheless profess mercy and holiness with the mouth<p>Something so very cruel was depicted to me this night, that anyone would shudder if he should get even a slight notion of it. Therefore I want to spare chaste eyes and ears an account of the details. They were proclaiming the mercy of God the Messiah, which they arrogated to themselves alone. For some quite trivial reason, as I explained to them, they seemed to want to lay a most cruel hand upon innocence itself, for the sake of revenge (but in the manner of spirits, who believe that what they conjure up by fantasy is really there). So they were occupied with an act entirely opposite to mercy, but whether they have any mercy, and charity, anyone can judge, since they themselves committed an act contrary to mercy and charity, just for the sake of vengeance against innocence - not against wickedness, or with a good motive. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 247</h4><p>247. THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF CERTAIN SPIRITS, WHO NEVERTHELESS PROFESS MERCY AND HOLINESS WITH THE MOUTH <p>This night something so very cruel was represented to me, that if anyone perceived but a slight idea of it, he would be horrified; wherefore I wish to spare chaste eyes and ears in referring to it. Certain spirits, from some very trifling cause, cried out for the mercy of God Messiah, which they claimed for themselves alone, as I also explained to them; for they seemed to lay a most cruel hand upon innocence itself for the sake of revenge; but it was only those spirits who suppose that what they apprehend in phantasy exists; thus they committed an act altogether opposed to mercy. But whether they have any mercy and charity anyone can judge, since of themselves they committed an act contrary thereto, solely for the sake of revenge against innocence, not against wickedness from a good end. </p>
