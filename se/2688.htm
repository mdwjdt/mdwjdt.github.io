<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2688</h4><p>2688. One who lives with faith in the Lord, and so lives in the Lord, cannot possibly suffer violence from evil spirits, being in the order of earthly, spiritual and heavenly things<p>Due to a general spiritual mental image I am given the insight that one who lives in order cannot possibly suffer violence from evil. For the whole of heaven is held in order by the Lord Alone, because He Alone is order. There is an order of heavenly, from that of spiritual, and from that of earthly things. In this order the universal heaven is kept by the Lord, and if it were not kept in order by the Lord Alone, the whole of it would perish, for all things to the very least have their beginnings from Him.<p>The order of spiritual and heavenly things is faith and all facets of belief in the Lord. Earthly things are like vessels, instruments and tools, and truths of nature, which regard earthly uses and goals, are the vessels into which spiritual, and into these heavenly things are slipped, without anyone's knowledge and consciousness of when and how, by the Lord Alone - not by the angelic heaven, for the Lord is the All in all things of goodness and truth. 1748, 26 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2688</h4><p>2688. THAT HE WHO LIVES IN FAITH IN THE LORD, THUS IN THE LORD CANNOT AT ALL BE VIOLATED BY THE EVIL, BECAUSE [HE IS] IN THE ORDER OF NATURAL, SPIRITUAL AND CELESTIAL THINGS. <p>It is granted to see from a spiritual general [communi] idea, that he who lives in order can by no means be violated by evil; for the universal heaven is held [kept] in order by the Lord alone, because He alone is order. There is an order of celestial, hence of spiritual, hence of natural things, in which order the universal heaven is held by the Lord, which unless it were held in order by the Lord alone, the universe would perish: for from Him, each and all things derive their principles [beginning]. The order of celestial and spiritual things is faith, and whatever pertains to faith in the Lord: Naturals are as it were, vessels, instruments, and organs [organica] and natural truths, which concern natural uses and ends are such vessels wherein spirituals are insinuated, and in these celestials, by the Lord, no one knowing [sciente et cognoscente] when and how. It is not [done] by the angelic heaven, for the Lord is the all in all of the good and true. - 1748, July 26. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2688 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2688. Qui in fide in Dominum, ita in Domino, vivit, quod violari a malis, nequaquam possit, quia in ordine naturalium, spiritualium, et coelestium<p>Ex idea spirituali communi videre datur, quod, qui in ordine vivit, nequaquam violari possit, a malo; nam universum coelum in ordine a Domino Solo tenetur, quia Ipse Solus est ordo; ordo est coelestium, inde spiritualium, et inde naturalium, in quo ordine tenetur universum coelum a Domino, quod nisi teneretur in ordine a Domino Solo, periret universum, nam ab Ipso trahunt omnia et singula sua principia, ordo spiritualium et coelestium est fides, et quae sunt fidei in Dominum; naturalia sunt quasi vasa, instrumenta, et organica, et veritates naturales, quae concernunt usus et fines naturales, sunt talia vasa, quibus spiritualia, et his coelestia, insinuantur, nemine sciente et cognoscente, quando et quomodo, a Solo Domino; non ab angelico coelo, nam Dominus, est omne in omnibus boni et veri. 1748, 26 Julius. </p>
