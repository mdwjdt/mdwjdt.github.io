<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4087</h4><p>4087. On change of places<p>I realized that unless societies were in divine order, so arranged that they interact with every single thing - every mental image as well as every fantasy - a spirit would in no wise be able to move from place to place, which fact was portrayed by an immoveable and inanimate object; also that the result of the Divine ordering of societies is that man is able to have mental imagery, consequently to think and to speak, and thus to appear to be moved from place to place - which transference and progression is an appearance and a fallacy, but occurs according to the variations of imagery or fantasy, thus of interacting societies that flow in, and from which they who are in the imagery or fantasy receive such impressions. From this come apparent changes of place, and other things, such as bodily progressions, rotations, as well as foldings, dismemberments, and such. 1748, 27 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4087</h4><p>4087. CONCERNING THE CHANGE OF PLACES.<p>It was perceived that unless societies are in divine order and so constituted as to correspond to every variety of idea as well as of phantasy, spirits could by no means remove themselves from place to place, which fact was represented by a certain immovable and inanimate something. It was perceived also that the divine ordination of societies is the cause that a man is able to have ideas, hence to think and to speak, and consequently to appear to be removed from place to place, which translation and progress is an appearance and a fallacy, but it is governed by the variation of idea or phantasy, and thence of corresponding societies, which flow in, and from which they who are in the idea or phantasy receive such [influences]. Hence are apparent mutations of place and other things, such as bodily progressions, circumrotations, foldings, lacerations, and the like. - 1748, November 27. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4087 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4087. De mutatione locorum<p>Perceptum, nisi societates in divino ordine essent, ita ordinatae, ut unicuique rei, cujusvis ideae, ut et phantasiae, correspondeant, quod nequaquam spiritus se movere posset a loco in locum, repraesentatum sicut immobile quid et inanimatum, tum quod ordinatio Divina societatum efficiat, ut homo ideas habere possit, proinde cogitare et loqui, et consequenter apparere, moveri a loco ad locum, quae translatio et progressio, est apparentia et fallacia, sed se habet secundum variationes ideae seu phantasiae, proinde societatum correspondentium, quae influunt, et a quibus talia recipiunt ii qui in idea seu phantasia, inde apparent mutationes loci, et alia, sicut progressiones corporis, circumrotationes, tum plicationes, lacerationes, et talia. 1748, 27 Nov. </p>
