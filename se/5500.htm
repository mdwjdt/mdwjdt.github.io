<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5500</h4><p>5500. They are those who have willfully and purposefully been murderers and have trained themselves in murder for a long time and afterward taken delight in it and at the same time been crafty and malicious, appearing outwardly as if they were honest men. Because they are like this, they are extremely dangerous in the other life. They can corrupt simple good spirits. Thus they are those who kill people in cold blood and not in heat, as it is said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5500</h4><p>5500. These are such as were murderers from will and deliberate intention, and accustomed themselves to it for a long time, and afterwards experienced delight in it, and at the same time were crafty and wicked, [though] exteriorly appearing as if honorable; for such ones are exceedingly dangerous in the other life: they are able to infest the simple-good. Thus, they are such as slay men in cold and not in hot blood - as was said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5500 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5500. Sunt illi qui homicidae fuerunt ex voluntate et proposito, seque diu exercuerunt in eo, et postea jucundum in eo acceperunt, et simul astuti fuerunt et malitiosi, exterius apparentes sicut sinceri, quia tales maxime periculosi in altera vita, possunt infectare simplices bonos, ita qui interfecerunt homines sanguine frigido et non calido, ut dicitur. </p>
