<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2369</h4><p>2369. Certain spirits who had had no preconceived opinion about matter, place, extension, parts without parts, or what substance is, grasped at once that it would be absurd to say that spirits were not basic substances. But those who had been learned, who were also around me and had a preconceived opinion about these matters, could not grasp it as well, clinging, of course, to their own meanings and definitions of such terms. In fact, when I was permitted by a spiritual mental image to separate thought from fine material organic substance, they were indignant, thinking that thus they would vanish into nothing.<p>They want to add that such things are a mockery that those called learned fabricate for themselves in definitions of certain terms, and that they thus close for themselves the way to an understanding of inward matters, remaining in the lowest, sensual and bodily regions. 1748, 20 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2369</h4><p>2369. Certain spirits who had no preconceived opinion of matter, place, extension, parts without parts, and what substance is, these perceived immediately that it was absurd to say that spirits were not subjects that are substances; but those who were learned, who were also around me, and had a preconceived opinion about these things, could not perceive it so well, inhering indeed in their significations and definitions of such words); yea, when it was permitted by means of a spiritual idea, to separate thought from an organic substance which was material and subtle, they were indignant, and supposed they should thus vanish into nothing; they wish to add that such things are jests [ludicra] which those called learned fashion for themselves in definitions of certain words so that they close to themselves the way for understanding interiors, remaining therefore in ultimates, sensuals, and corporeals. - 1748, June 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2369 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2369. Spiritus quidam, qui nullam praeconceptam opinionem habuerunt de materia, de loco, de extensione, de partibus extra partes, de substantia quid, ii illico perceperunt, quod id absonum esset dicere, quod spiritus non essent subjecta, quae substantiae, at vero qui docti, qui etiam circum me, et praeconceptam opinionem de iis habuerunt, non potuerunt id percipere tam bene, inhaerentes quippe significationibus suis et definitionibus talium vocum; imo cum per ideam spiritualem liceret separare cogitationem a substantia organica, subtili materiali, indignati sunt, et putarunt quod sic evanescerent in nihilum; volunt addere, quod ludicra sint talia, quae sibi in vocum quarundam definitionibus fingunt ii qui docti vocantur, sic quod claudant sibi viam ad intelligendum quae interiora, manentibus sic in ultimis, sensualibus et corporeis. 1748, 20 Junius. </p>
