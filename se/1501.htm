<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1501</h4><p>1501. Those eager for revenge can nevertheless pray devoutly<p>I noticed also while praying that sometimes [recent] souls, and spirits, were then even allowed to pray with me, so that I was allowed to see what belief and devotion they expressed in their prayers - for these qualities were communicated to me at the time. I realized that those who feel delight in revenge can nonetheless pray devoutly, as if from belief. And I could sense that there was no pretense in it, which surprised me. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1501</h4><p>1501. THAT THOSE DESIROUS OF REVENGE CAN ALSO PRAY DEVOUTLY <p>I have also perceived while I was praying that it was sometimes granted certain souls and spirits to pray with me. I was thence enabled to perceive in what faith and in what devotion they are and had been when praying, for this was communicated to me at the time. I perceived that those who feel delights in revenge could also pray devoutly, as if from faith, nor could I perceive that there was anything simulated therein. I wondered at this. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1501 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1501. Quod vindictae cupidi, etiam devote orare possint<p>Percepi quoque, dum orarem, quandoque etiam tunc concessum est, ut mecum orarent quaedam animae, ac spiritus, inde licuit mihi percipere, qua fide et qua devotione sunt ac fuerant in eorum orationibus, ea enim tunc mecum communicata sunt, et percepi quod ii, qui in vindictis delitias percipiunt, etiam devote orare potuerint, quasi ex fide; nec quod simulatum quid inesset, potui percipere, quod miratus. </p>
