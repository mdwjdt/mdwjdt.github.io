<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 931</h4><p>931. This cannot be illustrated in any other way than by comparison with an aura of effluvia emanating from the body, being such that when anything strikes against it, it either repels it, or changes it to agree with its own character or nature. So they themselves do not know that they are like this, and have this effect.<p>All spirits are surrounded with this kind of aura, such as those who frighten, or strike with fear, and the like. Nothing is allowed to enter within that aura that is repugnant, or opposes, unless it is an aura having a stronger action, in which case it causes pain, because the person and the aura make one. However, enlightened knowledge that does not approach with passion is able to enter it, and to be received. 1748, 22 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 931</h4><p>931. This can be represented no otherwise than by the sphere of the effluvia from the body. This sphere is such that when anything impinges upon it, it either reflects it, or bends it, in accordance with its own genius or nature; wherefore, these spirits do not know that they are such and that they produce such an effect. All spirits are as it were encompassed by such a sphere, as, for instance, those who terrify and inspire fear and the like. Within that sphere nothing is admitted that is repugnant or contrary, unless it be a sphere acting more powerfully; then it is done with suffering, because the spirit and his sphere make a one. Cognitions, however, which do not flow in with cupidity, can enter and be received. 1748, Feb. 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 931 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>931. Non aliter repraesentari queat, quam per sphaeram effluviorum e corpore, quae talis est, ut dum aliquid ei impingit, vel reflectat, vel flectat secundum genium seu naturam ejus, quare nesciunt ii, quod tales sint, et tale efficiant, tali quasi sphaera omnes spiritus circumdati sunt, sicut ii qui terrificant, qui incutiunt timorem, et similia. Intra sphaeram istam nihil admittitur quod repugnat, aut contrariatur, nisi sit sphaera fortius agens, tunc fit cum dolore, quia ipse et sphaera unum faciunt. Cognitiones <sup>1</sup></p><p>vero, quae non cum cupiditate alluunt, intrare possunt, et recipi. 1748, 22 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
