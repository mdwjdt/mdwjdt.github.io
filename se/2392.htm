<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2392</h4><p>2392. About the evident operations of spirits<p>From time to time I have observed, as discussed elsewhere, that spirits produced an effect on my body that was completely perceptible to every sense, just like objects outside of me. For example, they quite often spread odors, offensive or pleasant [<a href="323.htm">323</a>, <a href="618.htm">618</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>]. And we spoke about it, that they had maltreated my body to the point of considerably severe pain, and had done so on several occasions [<a href="318.htm">318</a>[a], <a href="153.htm">153</a>]. They had brought on feelings of cold or heat in a very obvious manner, and coldness more often [<a href="318.htm">318</a>, <a href="324.htm">324</a>, <a href="406.htm">406</a>, <a href="1855.htm">1855-1862</a>]. They had come at me like a gust of wind. I felt the wind plainly, and it even made the flame of the candle flicker.<p>So there can be no doubt that spirits are organic substances, and not just thought, as some like to conceive of them, apart from underlying substances [<a href="2366.htm">2366</a>, <a href="2369.htm">2369</a>], and almost persuade others to conceive of them by their descriptions of spirits, whom they deprive of every possible attribute. When all attributes are taken away, people cannot have any thought image of spirits, so they doubt, and they deny, not realizing that spirits in the body, or spirits separated from the body, are real substances, and in people on earth, substances that are joined with their physical material elements, and from which they cannot be separated as long as they live on earth. But the nature of this conjunction can also be dealt with. 1748, 23 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2392</h4><p>2392. CONCERNING MANIFEST OPERATIONS OF SPIRITS. <p>It has been observed here and there, as to which (see, elsewhere, that spirits have produced on my body effects entirely perceptible to sense [sensibilem prorsus], as regards every sense, just as external objects [do]: for instance, they have scattered disagreeable and sweet odors often enough and I have spoken of these things [namely] that they have maltreated my body [so as to cause] very grievous pain, and this on several occasions; have most manifestly induced cold and heat, and cold more frequently have, as it were, driven along blasts of wind: I have felt the wind plainly, yea, so as to cause the flame of the candle to flicker. Wherefore, it should not be doubted that they are organic substances, and not merely thought, as some [are wont] to conceive them abstractly from subject substances, and almost persuade others to conceive, by descriptions of spirits, from whom they abstract everything that can yet be predicated: these abstractions being made, man can no longer have any idea of them. Wherefore, they doubt and hesitate, and are ignorant that spirits in the body, or spirits separated from the body, are real substances, and such substances in man as are conjoined to the material [parts] of his body; for from these, whilst man lives, he cannot be separated. But of what sort is the conjunction, can also be related. - 1748, June 23. </p>
