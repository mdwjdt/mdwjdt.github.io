<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5426</h4><p>5426. The dragons, under the influence of those higher up, were conspiring against the heavenly doctrine, which they wanted to totally destroy. This rebellious action was discovered, and then the dragons, of whom there were many, were hurled toward the southeastern corner, quite far away, so far that they scarcely appeared. As a result of this it was then seen that an enormous number of spirits like this who were in heaven had fallen out of the heavens in every direction, far and wide; and the multitude that had fallen appeared like a starry mass like the Milky Way, which is described by the tail of the Dragon dragging the third part of the stars of heaven to earth [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Rev. 12:4</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5426</h4><p>5426. The dragons, from influx from the higher ones, conspired against the heavenly doctrine, which they wished utterly to destroy. That conspiracy was discovered, and, then, the dragons, who were very numerous, were cast a very great distance towards the south-eastern angle, until they were scarcely visible. Consequently on this, it was then seen that a vast multitude of such ones who were in heaven, fell down from the heavens on every side for the entire distance; and the fallen multitude appeared like a starry mass, as it were a Milky-way. This is described by the dragon drawing down the third part of the stars of heaven upon the earth. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Rev. 12:4</a>. -ED. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5426 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5426. Conspirabant dracones ex influxu a superioribus contra Doctrinam coelestem, quam prorsus destruere vellent, seditio illa detecta est, et tunc dracones qui multi fuerunt, conjecti sunt versus angulum orientali meridionalem admodum remotum, usque ut vix apparerent; inde tunc visum quod e coelis undequaque ad omnem distantiam delapsa sit ingens multitudo talium qui fuerunt in coelo, et apparebat multitudo delapsa sicut stellulosa quasi viae lacteae, quod describitur per quod cauda draconis detracti sint ad tertiam partem stellarum coeli in terram [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5426/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_4" target=_top>Apoc. XII: 4</a>]. </p>
