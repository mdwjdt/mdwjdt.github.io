<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 711</h4><p>711. A decoration was shown to me which then came up - just a decoration on a gate by itself. It was, by its constant variation, of a kind to surpass beyond measure all human imagination. For one decoration follows upon another, in entire processions, as far as the eye can see. This is now being displayed to them, as well as its continual changes one after another, and its seemingly live mobility. In short, it cannot be described, nor conceived of, and this is only the least and first [kind]. The yet deeper kinds are even more ineffable, not to mention the very inward and innermost kinds. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 711</h4><p>711. There was shown me simply a decoration which followed. It was only the decoration of a door which was such as indefinitely to surpass all human imagination by its endless variety. Thus one thing follows another, and so on through whole regions, as far as the eye can see. This is now represented to them, and this with a continually succeeding variety, and with a mobility as though it were living. In a word, it can neither be described nor conceived, and this is only the least and first [appearance]; those which are interior to these are still more ineffable, and even more so those which are more interior and inmost. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 711 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>711. Solum mihi ostensum est, decoramentum, quod successit, modo decoramentum portae, quod tale erat, ut cum perennante varietate superet omnem humanam imaginationem indefinities, sic unum excipit alterum, et sic per integros tractus, quousque oculus se extendit, quod nunc iis repraesentatur, tum <sup>1</sup></p><p>quoque cum varietate succedente continua, et cum mobilitate quasi viva; verbo, non describi potest, nec concipi, et hoc modo est minimum, ac primum; quae interiora adhuc sunt, adhuc minus effabilia sunt, minus quae intimiora ac intima.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition sic </p>
