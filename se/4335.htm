<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4335</h4><p>4335. The memory of spirits<p>Spirits do not speak among themselves out of any other memory than the inner one pertaining to their faculty of reason while they live in the body. But a person living in the world speaks out of the bodily memory. This is why spirits are able to speak with each other, and spirits of whatever land, region or tongue, can associate together, and converse. This is the language that comes down with me into a speech of words, which is not unlike the reasoning faculty with people on earth, out of which they think, and which likewise comes down into words, for their thinking spontaneously comes down into the speech of words. 1749, 30 July. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4335</h4><p>4335. THE MEMORY OF SPIRITS.<p>Spirits speak among themselves from no other than the internal memory, which is their rational while they live in the body; but man, while in the world, speaks from the memory of the body. Hence it is that spirits can speak with each other, and that all souls from whatever earth, region and language can dwell and converse together. This speech is what falls into the speech of words with me; it is something not dissimilar to the rational with man from which he thinks. This falls in like manner into words, for when one thinks his thought falls spontaneously into the speech of words. - 1749, July 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4335 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4335. Memoria spirituum<p>Spiritus non ex alia memoria loquuntur inter se, quam ex interiori, quae est rationalis eorum, cum vivunt in corpore, at homo, cum est in mundo, loquitur ex memoria corporis; inde est, quod spiritus inter se loqui possint, et omnes animae, cujuscunque terrae, regionis et linguae sunt, conversari queant, et colloqui; haec loquela est, quae cadit in loquelam vocum apud me; quod non dissimile est rationali apud hominem, ex quo cogitat, similiter cadit in voces, nam cum cogitat sponte in loquelam vocum cadit. 1749, 30 Julius. </p>
