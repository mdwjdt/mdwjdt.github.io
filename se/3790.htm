<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3790</h4><p>3790. About the dwelling of the Quakers<p>In sleep their dwelling appeared to me, having a spacious kitchen furnished with wide beds, one above another. In the higher one they lie when sleeping. I saw a man betaking himself thither and lying down. A maidservant approached him, laying herself at his side, but he turned away from her crosswise, as did others. Later some others were seen lying down there, all naked. In the bed below no one was lying. Underneath under this bed lay their little children, but they were boys.<p>In the same kitchen there was seen at the side a miserable wheel driven by water. In the middle were jars, covered, so I did not see whether they contained warm water. The covers of the jars caught fire, but they said they could easily put it out, so they were not worried.<p>On awakening I remembered the dream, and him who lay in the upper bed, who also then awoke from sleep and spoke with me, about both the wheel and the kitchen jars. Thus I was able to learn from this dream about their dwellings. What the beds symbolize, I do not yet know, except that they conform with their religiosity, thus that lying together in the upper bed pertains to their religion. Whether the lower bed where there was no one - unless my father and I were lying there - symbolized the Word; what was the lower layer far below, where their children were, I do not yet know. The miserable wheel driven by water symbolized their spiritual qualities. The fire kindled in the jar covers, which did not worry them, their heavenly qualities. What was in the jars, I do not know. 1748, 1 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3790</h4><p>3790. CONCERNING A QUAKER HOUSEHOLD.<p>Their household appointments were exhibited to me in sleep. There is a kitchen of ample dimensions, in which beds are arranged one above another. In the upper one they lie when they retire to rest. A man was seen to convey himself thither and to lie down. A maid-servant approached and laid herself by his side, but he turned away from her transversely [across the bed], as did also the others. Afterwards certain others were seen to lie down, all of them disrobed. In the bed below no one lay. Lower still under this bed were laid their children, but these were boys. In the same kitchen, on one side was seen a miserable wheel moved by water. In the center were covered casks, but whether containing warm water I did not observe. A fire seized the covers of the casks, but they said it could be easily extinguished, and cared nothing about it. When I awoke I recollected the dream, and him who lay in the upper bed, who also then awoke from sleep, and spoke with me both concerning the wheel and the kitchen casks, so that I was thence able to know that their households were ordered as I have described. What the beds signify I do not yet know, except that they agree with their religion, thus that the lying together in the upper bed has reference to their religion; also that the lower bed in which no one lay, unless my father and myself, signified the Word which was below. As to the couch still lower, where their children [reposed], I do not yet know [its import]. The miserable wheel driven by water signifies their spiritual things. The fire that caught upon the covers of the casks, which they did not heed, signifies celestial things. What was in the casks I do not know. <sup>1</sup>- 1748, November 1.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;What is here and elsewhere said of the Quakers is doubtless calculated, at first blush, to create an impression unfavorable to the charity and liberality of Swedenborg as the teacher of the doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church. It will probably be difficult for many readers to conceive how the principles of the Quakers, which are usually seen to ultimate themselves in a harmless, gentle, and blameless life, can be justly liable to such imputations as are virtually cast upon them by the tenor of these narratives. But it is important to remark that Swedenborg's disclosures have reference to the interior life and soul of every system of doctrines professing to be an embodiment of the truths of inspiration. "The nature and quality," says he, "of the Lord's church on the earth, cannot be seen by any man so long as he lives in the world; and still less, how, in process of time, it hath declined from good to evil; the reason whereof is, because man, during his life in the world is in externals, and only sees what is before his natural eyes: but the quality of the church as to spiritual things, which constitute its internals, is not apparent in the world, although in heaven it appears as in clear daylight. - (Last Judgement, No. 41.)<p>It is also to be observed that according to the tenor of his revelations, the Last Judgment was executed in the spiritual world - the first, or intermediate state after death - upon those who had not previously been consigned, by the character of their lives, to heaven or hell. Consequently the really good of this and every other sect had been previously put in possession of celestial bliss, and it is plainly to be inferred from what he says of Penn, that his condition was good, for he disclaimed all participation in the enormities ascribed to multitudes that bore the Quaker name. But surely we may suppose that the spirit of Penn actuated many of his followers, and that their state is equally good. Let then what is here said of the Quakers be understood of those only to whom it fairly applies. These are they who during their life in the world had lived in external sanctity, destitute of that which is internal, who had been just and sincere in obedience to civil and moral laws, but not in obedience to those which are divine, and who had consequently been external or natural men, and not internal or spiritual men. It may safely be presumed that such persons have always existed among the Quakers, as well as in other religious bodies. -Tr. </p>

De domicilio Quakerorum<p>In somno visum mihi est domicilium eorum, est ampla culina, ibi lati lecti, unus superior altero, in superiori jacent ii cum dormiunt, visus vir qui se contulit illuc, et cubavit, ad eum accessit ancilla, se adplicans lateri ejus, sed se concubare, et omnes nudi, in lecto infra nemo jacuit, infra sub hoc lecto jacebant infantes eorum, sed erant pueri; in eadem culina visa ad latus quaedam miserabilis rota acta ab aquis; in medio erant cadi, tecti, si aqua calida inibi non vidi, ignis arripiebat tegumenta cadorum, sed dicebant facile eum exstingui, ita nihil curabant; cum evigilatus, recordatus somnii, et ejus qui in superiori lecto jacebat, qui tunc evigilatus a somno, et mecum inde loquutus, etiam de rota et cadis culinae, sic ut inde scire possim, quod talia eorum domicilia, quid significent lecti nondum scio, praeter quod conveniant sic eorum religioni, sic quod cubatio simul in lecto superiori, eorum religionem; quod lectus inferior ubi nemo, nisi pater meus et ego jacebant, significabat Verbum, quod inferius erat stratum longe infra, ubi liberi eorum; nondum scio; rota miserabilis acta ab aquis significat eorum spiritualia; ignis accensus, in tegumentis cadorum, quem non curabant, [eorum] coelestia: quid in cadis non scio. 1748, 1 Nov. </p>
