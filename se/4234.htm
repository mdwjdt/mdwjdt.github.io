<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4234</h4><p>4234. I was with these spirits last night, and I slept there, and then when I woke up, I spoke with them there, and I saw that there are many such societies. When I was departing, they portrayed to me an aura composed of carriages and horses, appearing as small, and numerous, just as if there were such an aura, stately horses and carriages, together with something of sky blue, saying that they do this for guests who are taking leave of them. 1749, 23 April. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4234</h4><p>4234. I have been with these spirits during this night, and was among them in my sleep, and after awaking conversed with them there, and I perceived that such societies were numerous. As I was taking my leave of them, they represented, for my sake, an aura composed of chariots and horses, which were thus seen, apparently small and in great numbers, just as if there was actually such an aura composed of beautiful horses and chariots, together with something of the cerulean hue [of the sky]. They said they were accustomed to treat their departing guests in this manner. - 1749, April 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4234 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4234. Apud hos fui hac nocte, et ibi dormivi, et locutus dein cum evigilatus cum iis, ibi, et percepi quod plures tales societates sint, cum discederem repraesentabant mihi auram ex curribus et equis, ita visis, sicut parvi, et permulti, sic [visi] quasi ut talis aura, equi et currus decori; tum etiam aliquid coerulei; dicentes, ita facere hospitibus cum ab iis discedunt. 1749, 23 April. </p>
