<p>457.一大帮恶灵想要偷窃。我因被灵人迫使去感受他们的贪婪，所以发现他们经常想鼓动我去偷窃，即便是一些诸如商铺里几乎没有价值的东西；我发现这种意愿和这种努力来自灵人，他们甚至试图移动我的手。从这些事，以及一个活生生的声音，我知道他们曾是商人，在做生意的时候阴险狡诈，利用合法或非法手段为自己索取他人财物；这种秉性被保留下来。因此，这些灵人四处游荡，无论往哪里去，都觉得自己似乎在偷东西，不想其它。不过，他们被罚款，或者通过罚款被赶走。有些灵人则使用他们在世时所用过的狡诈手段，据说他们不想让人们知道这一切。（1748年1月11日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 457</h4><p>457. An enormous gang of evil spirits desire to steal<p>Because I was being forced by spirits into a sense of their greed, I observed that many times they wanted to incite me to steal, even such things as are of little value, such as are in their market shops. And I saw that this intention and this impulse came from the spirits, who were even trying to move my hand.<p>From these things as well as from an actual voice, I know that those who had been merchants and were deceitful in their business dealings, trying by any means, right or wrong, to get hold of the goods of others, retain this character. Consequently, such spirits wander about, and wherever they go, seem to themselves to be stealing, thinking about nothing else. But they are penalized, or driven away by punishments. Some use the same cunning they had used in life, so that they do not want people to know this. 1748, the 11th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 457</h4><p>457. THAT A GREAT CROWD OF EVIL SPIRITS DESIRE TO STEAL <p>Because I was impelled by spirits to sensate their cupidity, I have observed that they often wanted to excite me to steal, even such things as were of little value, such as are in their traders shops, and I have perceived that this was the intention and the endeavor of the spirits, who were also intent upon moving my hand. From them, and also by a living voice, I know that they were those who have been merchants, and in their business have made use of cunning, and wanted by means lawful and unlawful to claim for themselves the goods of others; that nature is retained. Such spirits, therefore, wander about, and wherever they go they seem to themselves to steal, thinking about nothing else. But they are fined, or are driven away by fines. Some make use of cunning similar to that which they had employed during their life. [It was said] that they do not want men to know this. 1748, Jan. 11. </p>

Quod plurima turba spirituum malorum furari cupiant<p>Quia agebar a spiritibus ad sensationem eorum cupiditatis, observavi, quod multoties excitare me vellent ad furandum, etiam talia, quae parvi pretii sunt, sicut in eorum officinis mercatoriis, et percepi quod ea intentio, ac is conatus esset spirituum, qui manum meam quoque movere intenderent; ex iis, tum a viva voce, scio, quod iis <sup>1</sup></p><p>, qui mercatores fuerunt, et in suis negotiis astu uterentur, seu per fas et nefas sibi aliorum bona vindicare <sup>2</sup></p><p>vellent, quod ea indoles retineatur; quare tales circumambulant, et ubicunque veniunt, furari sibi videntur, nihil aliud cogitantes, sed mulctantur, seu mulctis abiguntur; quidam simili astu utuntur, quo in vita, quod <sup>3</sup></p><p>nolint, ut homines id sciant. 1748, die 11 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ii<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has vendicare<p>3.&nbsp;hoc est sic ut </p>
