<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1854</h4><p>1854. This is like the case of spirits who were brought to believe that Aaron, with his sons, was holy when he had washed his feet and hands, and had put on that priestly attire [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_1.htm">Ex. 40</a>], no matter how defiled he had become. This was only persuasion by outer means regarding inner conditions, to the effect that he was holy.<p>To this end everything was set up outwardly in such a way that spirits would be persuaded. 1748, 6 April. There was a portrayal of the Lord, both in the attire and in all the rest of his actions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1854</h4><p>1854. (Similar is the case of certain spirits who were induced to believe that Aaron and his sons, however really defiled, were holy when they washed their feet and hands, and were clothed with the priestly robes. The idea of sanctity in this case was a mere persuasion concerning internals drawn from externals. Indeed, everything [in that dispensation] was thus externally instituted that spirits might [if they would] be persuaded by them. - 1748, April 6. There was in everything which was done, whether in respect to the garments or other things, a representation of the Lord.) </p>

Similiter ac spiritus, qui inducebantur credere, quod Aharon et filii ejus sanctus esset, quum lavasset pedes et manus, et indutus esset amictu isto sacerdotali [Exod. XL], utcunque erat conspurcatus; solum erat persuasio ab externis de internis, quod sanctus esset, ideo omnia ita externe instituta sunt, ut spiritus persuaderentur. 1748, 6 April. Erat <sup>1</sup></p><p>in omnibus repraesentatio Domini, tam in amictu et caeteris, quae faciebat.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
