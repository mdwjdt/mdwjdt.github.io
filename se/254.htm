<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>254.成千上万，事实上无数灵人和天使促成一个人的思维，弥赛亚神按次序排列并掌管他们。这一点在世人看来似乎是一个悖论；世人以为一个思维就是一个简单的单一事物，而不是由形成它的无数事物构成的。但自然界的众多事物可以证明：成千上万，事实上无数肌肉和纤维，甚至最细微的纤维从大脑到行为，一路促成一个行为。整个自然界都有类似现象，无数光线有助于形成一个物体，也有助于植物的繁殖。类似的事也适用于人的思维和情感，这一点更看似一个悖论，因为灵人和天使对人类心智的运作和流注还没有被经验证实。不过，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，我能凭经历说明：成千上万的灵人和天使促成一个思维，尽管只有其中一些灵人和天使在这个人身边。我不能解释这些经历，只能说；这一事实既通过视觉，也通过感觉被指示给我。我甚至察觉他们的运作，虽然有些模糊，但也很明确，以致我能确切地肯定它。我以不同的方式、在不同的时间察觉他们，既通过感觉，也通过低语。但他们的情况和状态照弥赛亚神的美意而各不相同。这一点对任何有学问的人来说并不奇怪，只要他正确对比自然界的事物和天堂的事物。（1747年11月19日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 254</h4><p>254. To one human thought, thousands, in fact a myriad, of spirits and angels contribute, all of whom God the Messiah arranges in order and governs<p>This cannot but appear as a paradox to a person on earth, who supposes that a thought is a simple unit, and not formed from tens of thousands of components. But even though it can be demonstrated by very many things in nature - [as] that to one action, thousands in fact myriads of muscles, as well as of the tiniest fibres all the way from the brain to the action, contribute, or, that throughout nature, myriads of rays contribute to the formation of one single object, as also to the propagation of growing things - still it appears as a paradox that something similar applies to a person's thoughts, and feelings, because the operation and influence of spirits and angels upon human minds has not been attested by experience.<p>But from experience, through the mercy of God the Messiah, I am able to say that thousands of spirits and angels contribute, even though only a few are very close by. I am unable to explain the experiences, but can only say that this fact has been shown to me on several occasions, by sight and also by sense. I have even perceived their operations, somewhat obscurely, but so tangibly that I can affirm the matter with certainty. I perceived them both by sensation and from the murmur, in different ways and at different times, but their situations and states vary, according to the good pleasure of God the Messiah. And this will not be strange to any educated person if he only rightly compares the things in nature with those which must be in the heavens. 1747, the 19th day of November (old calendar).<p>Like [the experience when] one spoke, and there was shown a bright cloud round about, so that I might see how much flowed in, also [how much] from his speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 254</h4><p>254. THAT THOUSANDS, YEA, MYRIADS OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS CONCUR IN ONE HUMAN THOUGHT, ALL OF WHOM GOD MESSIAH DIRECTS AND DISPOSES <p>This cannot but appear as a paradox to the man who supposes that a thought is simply one single thing, and not composed of myriads of things which form it. But it can be demonstrated from very many things in nature, as that for a single action thousands, yea, myriads of muscles and fibers and even the least fibers concur, from the brain even to the action itself. Similarly in all of nature, myriads of rays concur to the formation of one object; so likewise with plants, for their propagation. But that the like takes place in the case of man's thoughts and affections appears as a paradox, because the operation and influx of spirits and angels into human minds has not been confirmed by experience; but by the mercy of God Messiah, I can say from experience that thousands of spirits and angels concur in the production of a thought, although only some of them are near the man. I cannot set forth these experiences, save this only, that it has sometimes been shown to me visibly and sensibly as well. I have also perceived the operations obscurely, yet so distinctly to the apprehension that I am able to affirm it with certainty. I have perceived them in several ways and with alternations, both by sense and by a murmuring; but their situations and states were varied at the good-pleasure of God Messiah. Nor would this be wonderful to any learned person if he but rightly compare those things which are in nature, with those which must be in the heavens. 1747, Nov. 19, o.s. Like the spirit who spoke, and there was shown a bright cloud round about, in order that I might see to what extent he inflowed; also from the speech, etc. </p>

Quod ad unam cogitationem humanam concurrant millia imo myrias spirituum, et angelorum, quos omnes disponit et dirigit Deus Messias<p>Hoc ut paradoxon non potest non apparere homini, qui putat quod cogitatio sit simpliciter una, nec composita a myriadibus, quae eam formant, sed praeter quod a perplurimis in natura demonstrari queat, quod ad unam actionem concurrant millia imo myriades musculorum, et fibrarum etiam minimarum a cerebro usque ad actionem similiter in universa natura ad <sup>1</sup></p><p>unum objectum formandum myriades radiorum, ita in vegetatis ad propagationem eorum; sed quod simile fiat in cogitationibus hominis. ejusque affectionibus, id <sup>2</sup></p><p>, ut paradoxon apparet, quia spirituum et angelorum operatio ac influxus in mentes humanas per experientiam non confirmata est, sed ab experientia, per Dei Messiae misericordiam, dicere possum, quod millia spirituum et angelorum concurrant, tametsi aliqui solum proximi sunt; experientias exponere <sup>3</sup></p><p>non possum, sed id solum, quod id mihi ad oculum, tum ad sensum, aliquoties ostensum est; percepi etiam operationes, etiam obscure sed ad captum ita distincte, ut id affirmare queam pro certo, percepi et sensu, et ex murmure, aliquibus modis, et vicibus, sed situs et status eorum variantur ex beneplacito Dei Messiae; nec hoc mirum esse alicui docto poterit, si modo rite comparet ea quae in natura sunt, cum Iis, quae esse debent in coelis, 1747, die 19 Nov. st. v. sicut is qui loquutus et ostensus <sup>4</sup></p><p>candidus nimbus circum, ut viderem quantum influxit, et ex loquela etiam. <sup>5</sup></p><p>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
