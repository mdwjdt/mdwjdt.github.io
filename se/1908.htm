<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1908</h4><p>1908. A calm state of mind, and about heavenly states generally<p>A state of peace is on the higher level, a calm state of mind on the lower. Since early this morning, I have been allowed to learn from experience what a calm state of mind is like. There was a kind of drawing toward, or drawing upward to inner regions, toward spirits who were in a calm state, and had been through the entire night. This state lasted until morning, and afterwards for more than an hour, and I was thus allowed to find out how sweet that state is, and how incalculably many are the states of joy in heaven.<p>While in that state, I was then given to reflect on those people who like to live with the cares and worries involving bodily and worldly affairs, how miserable they are, though they imagine that they are then in their veriest joy. I was likewise given to reflect on how that [calm] state is little by little supplanted in the mind by a state of worries, like clouds in a fair sky.<p>This state, however, as well as many others belonging to those who are heavenly, cannot be felt, because they are unknown to the unknowing, consequently cannot be expressed credibly. In order to believe, they must have some knowledge that will enable them to believe. Nevertheless, I am able to say with certainty that the states of joy in the heavens are unlimited in respect to pleasantness and delights of all kinds, completely inconceivable to a person on earth, but nonetheless, these joys, even the very least of them, are such that when one feels them, one does not want ever to be in the body again, and engrossed in bodily and worldly cares. 1748, 9 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1908</h4><p>1908. A STATE OF MENTAL QUIET; CONCERNING CELESTIAL STATES IN GENERAL. <p>A state of peace is in a higher degree, a state of mental quiet in a lower. Today, from an early hour in the morning, it was given me to learn from experience the nature of a state of mental quiet, and, indeed, by a species of attraction or subtraction towards the interiors, and towards spirits who were in this quiet state, and that, too, for a whole night, the state continuing till morning, and afterwards for more than an hour. It was thus given to know how sweet the state is, and how indefinite are the states of joy in heaven. It was also given me, in that state, to reflect upon those who desire to live in cares and solicitudes pertaining to corporeal and worldly things, how miserable they are, though they imagine they are in their fullest delight. It was given also to reflect how this state [of quiet] might be supplanted by a state of solicitude, which are like clouds in a serene sky. States of this kind, however, together with many others which are peculiar to the celestials, cannot be perceived [by every one], for they are unknown to the unknowing; neither can they be so expressed in words as to be credible. A certain degree of knowledge may contribute something towards credence, but I can affirm that the states of joy are indefinite as to all things that are pleasant and delightful in the heavens, which yet no one, as a mere man [on the earth], can apprehend, but which still are such that, if one had a sense of them, even of the least, he would never more desire to be in the body, or in corporeal or worldly cares. - 1748, May 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1908 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1908. Status quietis animi, in genere de statibus coelestibus<p>Status pacis est in superiori gradu, status quietis animi in inferiori; hodie a mane ab experientia discere mihi dabatur qualis est status quietis animi, et quidem per speciem attractionis seu subtractionis versus interiora, ad spiritus qui in quiete erant, idque per integram noctem, qui status perstabat ad mane, et postea per horam, quod excedit, sic dabatur cognoscere, quam dulcis is status sit, et quam indefiniti status gaudii sint in coelo, tum in eo reflectere super eos qui in curis et rebus sollicitis de corporeis et mundanis cupiunt vivere, quam miseri sunt, tametsi ii putant esse tunc in suomet gaudio; reflectere etiam dabatur, quomodo status hic paullatim occuparetur a statu sollicitorum in animo, quae sunt sicut nubes in sereno; praeterea status hic, cum multis aliis, qui sunt coelestium, non percipi possunt, quia ignota ignotis, proinde non possunt verbis exprimi ad fidem, quia ut credant, ex scientia aliquid habebunt, ut inde credere possint; usque tamen asseverare possum, quod indefiniti sint status gaudii, quoad omnia jucunda et delitiosa, in coelis, quos <sup>1</sup></p><p>nusquam aliquis capere ut homo potest, sed qui tamen tales, imo minimus eorum talis est, ut dum eum sentit, nusquam velit in corpore esse, et in corporeis ac mundanis curis. 1748, 9 Maj.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quae </p>
