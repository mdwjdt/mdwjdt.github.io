<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2299</h4><p>2299. About those who would enter into the Divine mysteries through earthly philosophy, or physical things<p>There was someone who, when spiritual things were being discussed, conceived of them in a material way, which I saw by a spiritual mental image as little white lines - a sign that spiritual things are being conceived of in a material way - which, however are not material, being forces proceeding from substances. And so, when they want to enter from physical philosophy into matters that are spiritual and pertain to the faith, then their material ideas remain, which are thus displayed in the other life.<p>When truths of the faith are heard in the other life, such persons are extremely distressed, even to the point of anxiety, and they think they can hardly be cured. I was enabled to learn this today from experience on the part of a certain spirit, who was distressed for so long that they were despairing of his ever being cured. But no incurable illness or evil exists, because the power of the Lord is infinite. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2299</h4><p>2299. CONCERNING THOSE WHO WISH TO ENTER INTO DIVINE MYSTERIES BY NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, OR THE THINGS OF PHYSICS. <p>When the discourse was concerning spirituals, that which was perceived by me with a spiritual idea was perceived by a certain one materially; as it were, small white lines, which was a sign that spirituals are conceived of materially, which yet are not material things, because they are the powers of substances. When, therefore, they [who depend] on physics or philosophy desire hence to enter into those things that are spiritual and belong to faith, then their material ideas remain which are thus represented in the other life. Such persons are very greatly afflicted in the other life when they hear the truths of faith, yea, even to [that pitch] of anxiety, that they suppose they can scarcely be cured. This was given me to know today by experience, from a certain spirit who was so long afflicted that they despaired of his [cerum for ejus, I think] being cured. But no disease or irremediable evil is given, because the power of the Lord is infinite. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2299 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2299. De iis qui in Divina mysteria per philosophiam naturalem seu physicalia intrare [volunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>]<p>Quidam cum de spiritualibus sermo esset, materialiter id percipiebat, quod percepi idea spirituali sicut lineolas albas, quod signum est, materialiter concipi spiritualia, quae tamen non materialia sunt, quia sunt vires ex substantiis; cum itaque ii qui ex physica seu philosophia inde volunt intrare in ea quae spiritualia sunt, et fidei, tunc materiales ideae manent, quae sic repraesentantur in altera vita; tales quam maxime anguntur in altera vita, cum veritates fidei audiunt, imo usque ad anxietatem, ut vix putent se posse sanari, quod ab experientia ex quodam spiritu hodie nosse mihi datum, qui ita diu angebatur, ut desperarent de ejus sanatione; sed nullus datur morbus seu malum irremediabile, quia potentia Domini est infinita.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;hoc verbum manu B.
