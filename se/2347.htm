<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2347</h4><p>2347. But after the flood it is another matter. People after death lose nothing of their own life, but it is tempered, and what is theirs is bent toward pleasantness and goodness, and everything appears as theirs but bent toward goodness, yet it is the Lord's. These are they who have not profaned what is holy, and who are not forms of hatred joined with deceit. This is the state of the people after the flood, which is therefore compared to a rainbow, of whose colors the black is mankind's, but the light is the Lord's, together with whiteness, and without the light and whiteness, there is no color; nor is there color without black, for color is the mixing and blending of those two produced by the light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2347</h4><p>2347. But after the flood things are different. A man after death loses nothing of his own life, but it is so tempered, and what there is of it bent to what is pleasant and good, that all thereof appears his but as bent to good, but it is the Lord's. Such are they who have not profaned sacred things, and who are not hatreds and treachery. Such is the state of the post-diluvians, who are therefore compared to the rainbow, in whose colors black belongs to man, but the light with the white is the Lord's; and without light and white there is no color, nor does color exist without black, for it is a mixture and tempering of these effected by light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2347 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2347. At vero post diluvium alia res est, homo post mortem, nihil amittit ex suamet vita, sed ita temperatur illa, et flectitur quod ejus est in jucundum et bonum, ut ejus appareat omne, sed flexum in bonum, sed est Domini; tales sunt, qui non prophanarunt sancta, et qui non odia cum dolo sunt, talis est status postdiluvianorum, qui ideo comparatur iridi, in cujus coloribus nigrum est hominis, sed lux est Domini, cum candido, et absque luce et candido nullus color, nec color existit absque nigro, nam est mixtura et temperatura istorum, efficiente luce. </p>
