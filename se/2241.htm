<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2241</h4><p>2241. While I was in that sleep, and when they had been plunged under water, one of whom I saw beginning to emerge, suddenly I awoke. Several spirits were lamenting that they had been in the ship and submerged. They seemed to themselves just like people coming out of the water, their hair streaming and soaked with water, not knowing but that they were perishing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2241</h4><p>2241. While I was in that sleep, and while they were submerged, of whom I saw one slightly emerging form the waters, suddenly I waked. Some spirits lamented that they should have been in the ship and been submerged. To themselves they appear quite like those who emerge from the waters with flowing hair, and surrounded with water, not knowing other than that they would perish. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2241 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2241. Cum in somno isto eram, et cum submersi [erant], quorum unum vidi paulum emergentem, in aquis, [ego] subito expergefactus, lamentabantur aliqui spiritus, quod ii fuerint in navi et submersi, sibi visi prorsus sicut qui ex aquis emergunt, capillis fluentibus, et aqua circumfusi, nescientes aliter, quam quod perirent. </p>
