<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2290</h4><p>2290. Meanwhile, I was inspired with the thought that the Lord grants them such portrayals for the sake of their reformation, meaning that some yearn and long for displays of this kind just like little children, and that then an innocent state of mind is imparted to them, along with thoughts about heaven, symbolized by the land into which they were crossing over, all of which I also experienced. So through delightful play, they were not only being inspired with deeper knowledge of what the Jordan, the ark, the land of Canaan symbolize, but He was actually implanting those qualities in them under the mantle of that innocent, childish joy.<p>Therefore, those who were laughing at them, and would not stop doing so, were never able to achieve anything at all. To them it is being imparted that there are childish games like this that are useful, because they have the true purpose in them, the Lord, Who is the Innocent One Himself, and furthermore, that no earthly human's or any spirit's fantasies are like these, but are so evil that there can be no comparison. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2290</h4><p>2290. Meanwhile it was given me to think that the Lord grants such things to them for the sake of reformation, to wit, that certain long for such things and desire them out of innocence, just like infants, and that then they are endued with a state of innocence, together with thoughts about the heaven, signified by the land to which they were passing over. This also I perceived. Thus through delights was insinuated not only the knowledge of what [was meant] by the Jordan, the ark, [and] the land of Canaan, but at the same time under such infantile joy that was innocent he implanted similar things in them. Wherefore they who divided and did not refrain could never effect aught - in whom it is also insinuated that such infantile sports are of use, because they have in themselves the true end, or the Lord, who is Innocence itself [Ipse Innocens] and moreover, that the phantasies of no man and spirit, if considered, were like [theirs], which are so evil as not to bear comparison therewith. - 1748, June 11. </p>

Interea mihi dabatur cogitare, quod Dominus talia iis concedat reformationis causa, nempe quod quidam ex innocentia talia avent et desiderant, sicut infantes, et quod tunc iis indatur innocentiae status, una cum cogitationibus de coelo significato per terram in quam transirent, quod quoque percepi; ita insinuabatur per delitias non solum {a} cognitio, quid Jordanes, quid arca, quid terra Canaan, sed <sup>1</sup></p><p>simul sub tali infantili gaudio, quod innocens erat, plantabat similia in iis; quare ii qui subsannabant, et non desistebant [subsannare], nihil usquam perficere poterant; quibus quoque insinuatur, quod similes ludi infantiles sint qui usum ferunt, quia in se habent verum finem, seu Dominum, Qui est Ipse Innocens; et quod praeterea nullius hominis et spiritus phantasiae, si spectentur, sint tales-quae <sup>2</sup></p><p>ita malae sunt, ut cum iis comparari nequeant. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has et<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has tales quae </p>
