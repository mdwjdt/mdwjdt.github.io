<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>245.关于用“未泡透的灰所抹的墙”（以西结书13:10-15）来歪曲神圣事物的灵人。今天我再次被指示最坏的灵人如何歪曲神圣事物，即他们利用神圣事物如同它们就是自己的，好像拿它们来抹墙，以这种方式把它们带到人的感知面前；因此，单纯的人很容易被说服相信，这些神圣事物是从他们内心流出的；而事实上，这纯粹是“未泡透的灰”，如以西结书（13:10）所描述的。一开始我以为对内在事物的感觉来源于他们；但后来我得到更好的指教，被允许通过言语和代表向他们揭露这些灵人的欺骗。这一点惹恼了他们，即对良善的感知能从邪恶产生，对真理的感知能从虚假产生。“抹灰的墙”（参看以西结书13:10）也是这样来解释的（1747年11月12日）。他们起誓时自以为是良善和神圣的，就像圣言时而所论及的龙一样；然而，他们却心怀恶毒，尽管在这种状态下他们不知道这一点。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 245</h4><p>245. About spirits who distort holy things by "plastering with untempered mortar" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_13_10.htm">Ezek. 13:10-15</a>]<p>Today again, I was shown how the worst spirits distort holy things, namely that they bring holy things to bear as if they were their own, and as it were plaster them over, and bring them in this form to human consciousness; consequently, innocent people can easily be persuaded that the very inward holy things come from those spirits, when yet it is mere "untempered mortar," as described in Ezekiel [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_13_10.htm">13:10</a>].<p>At first I considered that the sensation of very inward things originated from them, but afterwards, when better informed, I was allowed to expose their deceptions to them through conversation and symbolic depiction. This angered them, especially the fact that from something evil a perception of goodness can result, and one of truth from something false. Along these lines the clay wall [v.10] was also explained. 1747, the 12th day of November (old calendar).<p>They imagine they are good and holy when they are declaring their vows, like the dragon now and then, when yet inwardly they harbor malice, although in that state they do not know it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 245</h4><p>245. CONCERNING SPIRITS WHO PERVERT HOLY THINGS BY PLASTERING THEM OVER WITH "UNTEMPERED [MORTAR]" <p>It was also shown me today how the worst spirits pervert holy things, namely, that they apply those things that are holy just as if they were their own, and as it were plaster them over, and in this way bring them to man's perception, so that those who are innocent can easily be persuaded that the holy things which are more interior flow from them, when yet it is mere "untempered mortar", as is described in Ezekiel [ <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_13_10.htm">xiii 10</a>. At first I supposed that the sensation of the more interior things came forth from them; but after I had been better instructed, it was given me to expose their deceits to them, by speech and representations. This made them angry, namely, that in this way a perception of good can be produced from evil, and of truth from falsity. Thus also was the "plastered wall" explained. [See Ezekiel <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_13_10.htm">xiii 10</a> ]. 1747, Nov. 12, o.s. <p>They think themselves good and holy when they are making profession, like the dragon here and there [spoken of in the Word], when yet inwardly they cherish malice, although in that state they do not know it. </p>

De spiritibus, qui pervertunt sancta, per incrustationem inepti<p>Hodie etiam mihi ostensum est, quomodo pessimi spiritus pervertunt sancta, quod nempe ea quae sancta sunt, applicent tanquam sua, atque ea incrustant quasi, et sic ad perceptionem hominis perducunt, sic ut qui innocentes sunt, facile possint persuaderi, quod sancta quae intimiora sunt, ab iis fluant, cum tamen sit mera "incrustatio inepti," sicut describitur in Ezechele [XIII: 10-[16]; arbitratus sum principio quod intimiorum sensatio ab iis proveniret, sed postea melius edoctus, dabatur mihi dolos eorum iis exponere per loquelam et repraesentationes, quibus irati sunt, nempe quod sic induci queat perceptio boni a malo, et veri a falso, ita quoque luteus paries [v. [10] explica batur. 1747, die 12 Nov. st. v.
