<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 996</h4><p>996. Truth frightens<p>In the other life, such terror can strike people that they almost melt away, even those who during their life had not experienced any terror. Actually, the terror results from truth devoid of goodness, or mercy. This terror then penetrates to the marrows, and almost breaks the bones. For truth condemns, and indeed, to the lowest hell, and without any end in sight.<p>But this terror did not come over these spirits; for truth, or the terror of truth, invaded only one, who had been the kind that thought he could never be frightened. But afterwards he admitted that all his courage had been taken away, and he had been brought very low. In the same way terror is also brought on by an arm, a naked one, spoken of earlier [<a href="881.htm">881-882</a>]. 1748, 25 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 996</h4><p>996. THAT TRUTH TERRIFIES <p>In the other life spirits may be struck with such great terror - even those who during their life had lived almost without feeling terror - that they, as it were, dissolve. Indeed, the terror arises from truth wherein is no goodness or mercy. This terror then penetrates the marrows and as it were breaks the bones; for truth condemns even to the lowest hell, with no perceptible ending. But such terror was not present with those spirits [spoken of above, n. <a href="../se/995.htm">995</a>, for the truth, or the terror of the truth, invaded only one, and he had been such that he supposed he could never be terrified. But he confessed afterwards that all his courage was taken away and he became utterly abject. So also, terror is brought by a naked arm, as before mentioned [nos. <a href="../se/881.htm">881-882</a>. 1748, Feb. 25. </p>

Quod veritas terrificat<p>In altera vita tantum terroris incuti potest, ut quasi diffluant, etiam ii qui in vita fere absque terrore vixerunt, et quidem terror existit a veritate, in qua non bonitas, seu misericordia, tunc talis terror penetrat medullas, et quasi frangit ossa, nam veritas condemnat et quidem ad infimum infernum, et absque percepto fine {a}, sed talis terror his non affuit, modo enim veritas seu veritatis terror unum invasit, qui talis fuerat, ut putare <sup>1</sup></p><p>se nusquam potuisse terrificari, sed postea fassus est, quod omnis animositas ablata sit, et vilissimus factus.
