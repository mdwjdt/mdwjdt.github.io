<p>364.灵魂和灵人当中不仅盛行感官谬误，还盛行大量幻觉和想象；因此，一个显而易见的事实。值得注意的是，灵魂和灵人拥有感觉，完全如同在肉体中那样。他们如在肉体中那样有触觉，如他们触摸自己衣服时的情形。这同样适用于他们的欲望、食欲、热、冷，甚至出汗，它们如同在肉体中那样真实；然而，这时它们只能被称为幻觉。但由于感觉如在肉体中那样真实，所以它们也如同真实的。类似的事通过一个心理投射的过程在他们身上引发，我能通过许多例子证实这一点。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 364</h4><p>364. There are not only fallacies of sense, but also much illusion and imagination prevailing among souls and spirits, consequently an apparent actuality<p>It is remarkable, but souls and spirits have sensation altogether as in the body - touch, as in the body, like when they feel their clothes. The same is true of strong desires and appetites, heat, cold, even sweat, which are just as actual as they are in the body, when yet they cannot be called anything but illusions. But because the sensation is as real as it is in the body, they are as if real.<p>Conditions of this kind are brought on by a process of mental projection, as I can corroborate by very many instances. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 364</h4><p>364. THERE ARE NOT ONLY FALLACIES OF THE SENSES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO PHANTASIES AND IMAGINATIONS WHICH REIGN AMONG SOULS AND SPIRITS; HENCE THE APPARENT ACTUALITY <p>It is astonishing that souls and spirits have sensation altogether as in the body. They have the sense of touch as in the body, as when they touch their garments; it is similar with regard to their lusts and appetites, heat, cold, and even sweats, which are as actual as they are in the body, when yet they can be called nothing else than phantasies: but because the sense is real, like that in the body, they are as if real. Similar things are induced upon them by an imaginative direction, which can be confirmed from very many things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 364 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>364. Quod non modo sint fallaciae sensus, sed etiam phantasiae ac imaginationes, quae inter animas et spiritus regnant, inde apparens actualitas<p>Mirificum est, quod animae ac spiritus sensum prorsus ut in corpore habeant, tactum sicut in corpore, sicut si tangunt vestes, similiter quoad concupiscentias, et appetitus, calores, frigora, imo sudores, quae ita actuales sunt, ut sunt in corpore, cum tamen non aliter possunt appellari ac phantasiae, sed quia sensus est realis qualis in corpore, sunt quasi reales; iis similia inducuntur per directionem imaginativam, quod perpluribus constare potest. </p>
