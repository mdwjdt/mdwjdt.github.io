<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2918</h4><p>2918. How mankind is also led to good goals, even by the evil<p>It was noted today that evil spirits who were controlling my thoughts were pouring in goals or uses from their standpoint for the sake of evil, but [which were turned] by the Lord to a good purpose, so that the intention of the evil hardly appeared. For they want a thing, this or that use, for an evil motive, but the use was being directed by the Lord toward a good purpose, so that the evil spirit's intention or purpose was hardly discernible. Thus is mankind by means of evil spirits, directed by the Lord toward good. 1748, 25 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2918</h4><p>2918. HOW MAN IS ALSO LED TO GOOD ENDS, EVEN BY THE EVIL. <p>It was observed, today, that evil spirits who ruled the thoughts, infused ends or uses, with [in] them, on account of evil, but [that it is turned] by the Lord to a good end, so that there scarce appeared the intention of evils [the evil]; for they only desire this, to wit, this or that use, from an evil end; but the use was determined by the Lord to a good end, so that there was scarcely perceived the intention or end of evils [the evil]. Thus man is directed by the Lord, through evil spirits, to good. - 1748, August 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2918 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2918. Quomodo etiam homo ad bonos fines, etiam ducitur a malis<p>Observatum hodie, quod spiritus mali, qui regebant cogitationes, quod infunderent fines seu usus, apud eos, propter malum, sed a Domino ad finem bonum, sic ut vix apparuerit malorum intentio, solum enim hoc seu hunc aut eum usum volunt ex malo fine, sed usus determinabatur a Domino ad finem bonum, sic ut vix perciperetur malorum intentio seu finis; ita per malos spiritus a Domino regitur homo ad bonum. 1748, 25 Aug. </p>
