<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3910</h4><p>3910. Those who have a conscience can be improved in the other life<p>I was told, and also realized, that those involved in fantasies, and in falsities, provided they have kept marriage love holy and have had a conscience especially in that respect, can be improved in the other life, even though they might have been obstinate, or might have stuck obstinately to their own opinions and falsities. But those on the other hand who did not have a conscience, especially those who had considered adulteries as nothing, and in other matters during their life had acted in a criminal manner without conscience, their life appears in the other life as if without restraint, thus without any connection with heaven. Those having no conscience in regard to adulteries, are so to speak bereft of every bond. These are the ones who cannot be improved, so as to be able to come among the heavenly, except as beings scarcely conscious of themselves - that is, as bones, in which there must still be life, for a bone without something living is of no use in the human body. 1748, 9 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3910</h4><p>3910. THOSE WHO HAVE CONSCIENCE MAY BE AMENDED IN THE OTHER LIFE.<p>It was said to me, and perceived likewise, that those who are in phantasies and in falsities, provided they have held conjugial love sacred and have had conscience, especially if they have been in it and who have thus had conscience that such in the other life are capable of amendment, even though they might have been obstinate, or might obstinately have inhered in their opinions and falsities; but that those who had not conscience, especially if they accounted adulteries as nothing, and in other things were during their life without conscience, they appear in the other life, as it were, without [any] restraining bond, and thus without connection with heaven. Those who have had no conscience in regard to adulteries, and thus have been as it were without bond, they are those who cannot be amended so as to be able to come among the celestials, except as those that are scarcely self-conscious, that is, as bones in which there may yet be life, for a bone without vitality can serve to no use in the human body. - 1748, November 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3910 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3910. Qui conscientiam habent quod in altera vita emendabiles<p>Dictum mihi, et perceptum quoque, quod qui in phantasiis sunt, et in falsitatibus, modo amorem conjugialem sanctum habuerint, et conscientiam habuerint, in eo cumprimis, ita qui conscientiam habuerint, quod ii in altera vita emendabiles sint, tametsi contumaces essent, seu contumaciter inhaererent suis opinionibus et falsitatibus; at vero qui non habuerunt conscientiam, cumprimis qui adulteria pro nihilo aestimaverant, et in reliquis nefas absque conscientia facere, eorum vita apparet in altera vita quasi absque vinculo, ita absque nexu cum coelo, qui nullam conscientiam pro adulteriis, ii quasi soluti omni vinculo, ii sunt, qui non possunt emendari, ut inter coelestes venire possint, nisi sicut sui vix conscii, ut nempe ossa, in quibus usque erit vita, nam os absque vitali non inservit usui in corpore humano. 1748, 9 Nov. </p>
