<p>380.除此之外，还有其它折磨灵魂的状态。除了前面（377节）所提到的幻象状态外，还有其它状态；例如，灵魂以为他们正背着人，这些人不停地问他们，直到找到一个真正的答案。他们觉得背这些灵人是一种负担，也不能在分离的时间到来之前把他们从身上放下来。有些灵人则受到不同的折磨：他们仰卧在下坡上，想要留在那里；那里有人安慰他们，但这些人满足于自己的命运，因为极端的痛苦已经消除了。也有些人四处游荡，无论往哪里去，总是问有什么需要他们做的工作；在被回答没有工作之后，他们继续往前走，直到找到工作为止。（1747年12月23日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 380</h4><p>380. There are other states besides that afflict souls<p>Aside from the states [of fantasy] mentioned [<a href="377.htm">377</a>], there are also other ones, like thinking they are carrying people on their backs who interrogate them unceasingly until they have gotten the right answer. Carrying such [spirits] is burdensome for them, and they cannot get rid of them before the time for release has come.<p>Some [are afflicted] differently: they lie on their backs on a downward slope, and there they want to stay. There are some there who comfort them, but they are content with their lot; for their outermost part has been removed.<p>There are also those who wander about, and wherever they come, ask whether there is any work for them that needs doing. After being answered that there is no work, they go on farther, and they keep this up until they find work. 1747, the 23rd day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 380</h4><p>380. MOREOVER THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHICH AFFLICT SOULS <p>Besides the states mentioned, there are also others; for instance, [souls] suppose that they are carrying men on their back, who question them without stopping until they have found a true reply; they carry them as a burden, nor can they be released from them before the time of separation comes. Some are [afflicted] differently: they lie on their back on a downward slope, and there they desire to stay; there are those there who comfort them, but these are content with their lot, for the extreme [suffering] has been removed. There are also those who wander about, and wherever they go they inquire whether there is any work for them which ought to be done; after a reply that there is no work, they go on further, and this until they find some. 1747, Dec. 23. </p>

Praeterea <sup>1</sup></p><p>sunt alii status, qui affligunt animas Praeter status memoratos, etiam sunt alii, nempe quod se putent gestare homines a tergo, qui eos interrogant, nec omittunt antequam invenerint responsum verum, tales portant cum onere, nec ab iis dissolvi possunt, antequam tempus solutionis venit. Quidam aliter, jacent supinati, et in declivi deorsum, ac ibi morari cupiunt, sunt qui eos ibi consolantur, sed ii sunt contenti sorte sua; extimum enim amotum est. Sunt etiam qui pervagantur, et ubicunque veniunt, quaerunt, num aliquis labor iis, qui faciendus; post responsum, quod nullus labor, ulterius pergunt, et sic usque dum inveniunt. 1747, d. 23 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Praetereae </p>
