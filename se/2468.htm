<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2468</h4><p>2468. That symbolic display, as if the outer part of the head is being raised up, results only from the fact that association is taken away from them with spirits in the outer parts, who interact in their own way, and when these are taken away this drawing up of the skull or outward part of the head appears. Then his inward parts show themselves, and they explore the quality of his nearest inward, or earthly parts.<p>But this happens very seldom, for this kind of exploration is not permitted except for definite reasons, as that they may be instructed about things that serve a use to them, as well as for the reason that they may not hurt the spirit concerned, because then he is not harmed. 1748, 30 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2468</h4><p>2468. The representation of the abstraction of the outer part of the head arises only from this - that from them is taken away association [societas] in externals, with spirits that correspond in their manner when being removed. Such a raising up of the head, or of the outer part of the head, appears; then his interiors become manifest; hence is he explored of what quality are his next interior things, or naturals; but this [occurs] very rarely, for such exploration is not permitted save for certain reasons, that they may be instructed concerning such things as serve them for use; also for the reason that they may not hurt such a spirit, because at such time he is not hurt. - 1748, June 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2468 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2468. Repraesentatio ea, quod subducatur externa pars capitis, existit solum ex eo, quod iis adimatur societas cum spiritibus in externis, qui correspondent suo modo, quibus ablatis, talis sublevatio cranii, seu exterioris partis capitis apparet, tunc interiora ejus se manifestant, inde exploratur, qualia sunt proxima ejus interiora, seu naturalia, sed hoc rarissime, nam talis exploratio non permittitur, nisi ex causis certis, ut instruantur de iis, quae iis usus cedunt, etiam ex causis, ne laedant talem spiritum, quia tunc non laeditur. 1748, 30 Junius. </p>
