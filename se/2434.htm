<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2434</h4><p>2434. But at this day it is not so - open miracles have ceased, and miracles have taken their place that are unknown to us and do not appear, except to those to whom the Lord reveals them. For all things that happen, the all in all things, in the greatest whole, in collective entities, in individual ones, in the very least things, are miracles, but invisible, and likewise continuous. These do not appear because open miracles have ceased for the reason that no belief is acquired by miracles. This is the reason they do not appear to people on earth, whose nature it is to distort and apply to earthly interests, thus to evil, whatever they see openly. So they are kept in ignorance, for to distort these things when open and visible is to profane them, and people would thereby jeopardize the possibility of their salvation - especially someone who knows deeper matters of faith. 1748, 28 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2434</h4><p>2434. But at this day it is not so; manifest miracles have ceased, and miracles have succeeded which are unknown to man, and do not appear but to those to whom the Lord reveals them, for all contingencies, which are all in all, in the most general [communissimo], in the general, in singulars, [and] in most singular things, are miracles, but are invisible and continual, which inasmuch as manifest miracles should cease, are not patent, because no faith [is based] on miracles. Thus man, who is of such a nature, that whatever he manifestly sees, still perverts, and bends to natural causes, thus to evil, for which reason [miracles] are not patent, as well as that man is kept in ignorance, because to pervert those things which are manifest and visible is to profane [them], thus man would undergo danger, [if indeed] he could ever be saved. Especially [is there danger] to the man who knows the interiors of faith. - 1748, June 28. </p>

Sed hodie non ita, cessarunt miracula manifesta, et successerunt miracula, quae homini ignota sunt, et non apparent, nisi iis, quibus Dominus revelat, omnia enim contingentia, quae omne in omnibus sunt, in communissimo, in communibus, in singulis, in singularissimis, sunt miracula, sed invisibilia, et continua, quae quia miracula manifesta cessarent, non patent, quia ex miraculis fides nulla, ita homini <sup>1</sup></p><p>, qui talis est, ut quicquid manifeste videt, usque pervertat, et in naturales causas flectat, sic in malum, non patescunt, tum ut homo teneatur in ignorantia, nam pervertere ea quae manifesta et visibilia sunt, est prophanare, ita homo periculum subiret, si usquam salvari posset; imprimis apud hominem {a} qui interiora fidei novit. 1748, 28 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has homo; cf. indicem ad Miraculum </p>
