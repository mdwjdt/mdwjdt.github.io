<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2341</h4><p>2341. About speaking at times outside of the group<p>At times I have been in conversation, and the others spoke without my taking in what they were saying, as is happening now. This is a sign that at that moment one is not speaking in that group, but with a different society of spirits. For one who is in a group hears what is said. One who speaks, but not paying attention to the things being said [in reply], is speaking with spirits farther away from the group. So from the way the speaking is being received, one can even judge whether one is in the group, or outside of it, or nearer or farther in between. 1748, 17 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2341</h4><p>2341. CONCERNING SPEECH ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITHOUT [extra] THE SOCIETY. <p>When I spoke, and others spoke, by perceiving nothing that they said, they did not happen to know that it is a sign they do not then speak in society, but with another society of spirits, for he who is in society perceives what is said, and speaks so as not then to attend to what is said; he speaks with those who are more remote from the society. Wherefore from the perception of speech it may also be decided whether he is within or without the society, or in an intermediate station, near, or remote. - 1748, June 17. </p>

De loquela aliquoties extra societatem<p>Quandoque loquutus sum, et alii loquuti, nihil percipiendo quid diceret, sicut nunc <sup>1</sup></p><p>contigit, quod signum est, non loqui tunc in societate, sed cum alia societate spirituum, nam qui in societate, is percipit quid dicitur; qui loquitur ut non tunc intendat iis quae dicuntur, is loquitur cum remotioribus a societate, quare ex perceptione loquelae judicare etiam potest, num intra societatem, aut extra, aut intermidie, prope vel remote. 1748, 17 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript; in J.F.I.
