<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2272</h4><p>2272. About the action of spirits on the prophets of old<p>We know from the Word of the Lord that the prophets of old made various gestures which, if they lived today and had done the same, would mark them as obsessed-such as Saul's lying naked [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_19_24.htm">1 Sam. 19:24</a>], and other such actions. This leads to the conclusion that they had been entirely obsessed by spirits, who took possession of their body and all the senses and functions of their body, to the point where they imagined themselves to be the prophet's body entirely. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2272</h4><p>2272. CONCERNING THE ACTION OF SPIRITS IN [INTO] THE PROPHETS IN FORMER TIMES. <p>It is known from the Word of the Lord that the prophets in former times [used many postures], had various gestures, and that if they had lived today and performed such things they would be regarded as obsessed: take, for instance [sicut], that Saul laid down naked, and many such things; from which it may be concluded that they were wholly obsessed by spirits, who occupied their body, and all the senses and functions of the body, so that they thought that they were wholly his body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2272 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2272. De actione spirituum olim in prophetas<p>Notum est ex Verbo Domini, quod prophetae olim varios gestus habuerint, sique hodie vixissent, et talia effecissent, quod sicut obsessi reputarentur, sicut quod Saulus nudus jacuerit [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2272/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_19_24" target=_top>I Sam. XIX: 24</a>], et plura similia: ex quibus concludi potest quod prorsus obsessi fuerint a spiritibus, qui corpus eorum et omnes sensus, et functiones corporis occuparunt, ut putarent se corpus ejus prorsus esse. </p>
