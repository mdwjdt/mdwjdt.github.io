<p>343.试探和净化的状态：弥赛亚神不试探任何人。我还通过活生生的经历被指示，试探如何由内在的痛苦折磨，同时由内在的疼痛产生；同样，在这种状态下，他们多么想知道他们当信什么；他们总是想来自他们自己的东西，即：通过试探，他们想索求某种功德，从而进入天堂，以及其它我无法发现的想法。此外，我被指示当时其想法的性质，即：凡他们所听见、看见的，都一文不值，都是虚空，几乎不是真的；他们的良心或多或少认同这些想法。因此，我被允许观察他们如何从这种试探当中走出来。简言之，我发现，他们只能以为弥赛亚神容许试探；然而，这种想法依然含有祂试探人的意思。（1747年12月15日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 343</h4><p>343. The state of temptation and purging: God the Messiah tempts no one<p>I was also shown by actual experience how temptations are caused by inner torments of distress, and at the same time, inward grief; likewise, how they long when they are in that state to know what should be believed, and how that [thought] keeps coming up that they [act] from themselves, and they therefore want to claim some merit for undergoing temptations, and thus enter heaven - as well as other thoughts I could not observe.<p>In addition, [I was shown] what their thinking was like at the time - as that everything they had heard and seen was of little value, empty, almost untrue - to which thoughts their conscience more or less assented. Thus it was allowed to observe how they were when emerging from that state - in short, they could not but think that God the Messiah permits temptations, which still involves [the idea] that He tempts. 1747, the 15th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 343</h4><p>343. THE STATE OF TEMPTATION AND VASTATION. THAT GOD MESSIAH TEMPTS NO ONE <p>It has also been shown me by living experience, how temptations are brought about by the internal torments of anguish, and at the same time by interior pains: likewise how in that state they want to know what they ought to believe: and that which is from themselves always occurs to them, namely, that by temptations they want to merit something, and so to enter into heaven, besides other things which I could not observe. I was also shown the nature of their thought at the time, namely, that whatever they have heard and perceived is nothing, vain, almost untrue, with a certain consent of conscience. I was then allowed to observe how they emerged from such temptation. In short, I observed that they could not suppose otherwise than that God Messiah permits temptations, which involves, however, that He tempts. 1747, Dec. 15. </p>
