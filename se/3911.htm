<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3911</h4><p>3911. About lewd [spirits]<p>There appeared a sky blue starry heaven, and below it something dark like a rugged rock, out of which a spirit was arising, who flew out from there above my head, and spoke with me. But he spoke like those who have not much rationality, which is recognizable from the speech, which is like the speech of those who are not in a spiritual state, but an earthly one. Then the spirits above my head came, who affected the brain like a gentle, almost watery rolling thing. I did not know of what quality they were. The spirits said they certainly imagined that they spoke among themselves, but did not understand their speech. The spoke now and then, but how much they knew of what was said, I could not really tell, because I was not reflecting on the matter. That wavy rolling thing adhered to my head in various ways, and more tenaciously than the rest, even so as to occupy the bones of the skull, from which point they were trying to penetrate more deeply, but were not able - only in fantasy, so that they would seem to themselves to be doing so, when yet they were in the bones of the skull. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3911</h4><p>3911. CONCERNING THE LASCIVIOUS.<p>There appeared a cerulean starry heaven, and underneath a dark cloudy something like a cragged rock from which arose a spirit who soared upwards from thence above the head, and thence spoke with me; but he spoke as one who had little of the rational, which was known from his speech, it being that of those who are in a natural and not in a spiritual state. There then came spirits above my head, who affected the brain as a soft and almost watery mass or volume, of whose quality I was ignorant. The [other] spirits said that they supposed that they spoke among themselves, but they did not understand their speech. They one and all spoke, but whatever the [other] spirits knew as to their speech, I could not thus know it, because I did not reflect upon it. This undulating mass adhered variously to the head, and more tenaciously than others, even so as to occupy the bones of the cranium, whence they wished [to pass] more interiorly, but they were not able, except by phantasies, so that they seemed to themselves [to have entered in], when yet [they merely clung] to the cranial bones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3911 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3911. De Lascivis<p>Visum erat coelum coeruleum stelliferum, et intra tenebrosum quid sicut rupes inaequalis, e qua assurgebat spiritus, qui inde evolabat supra caput, et inde mecum loquutus, sed loquutus sicut qui non multum rationale habent, quod cognoscitur ex loquela, sicut qui non in spirituali statu sunt, sed in naturali: tunc venerunt spiritus supra caput meum, qui sicut volumen molle fere aqueum afficiebant cerebrum, non sciebam quales, spiritus dicebant, quod quidem putarent eos loqui inter se, sed quod non intelligerent eorum loquelam; passim loquebantur; sed quantum sciebant quid loquuti, non ita scire potui, quia non reflectebam super id: volumen hoc undulans varie adhaesit capiti, et tenacius reliquis, usque ut occuparent ossa cranii, inde volebant interius, sed non poterant, solum per phantasias, ut sibi viderentur, cum tamen in ossibus cranii. </p>
