<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1426</h4><p>1426. One spirit was able to speak skillfully with them. While he spoke with them, I, being in the body, was not able to portray things to them so swiftly, so that although they would say it was going fine, they nevertheless at once judged that this was done with too much polish, or that too cleverly, and so on, thus not approving it as being to their mind. This is certainly a property of inner sensation, for inner sensation has its own perception, and judges things at once, spontaneously, and from its own character.<p>From the perception belonging to that sensation, one could conclude that those spirits constituted the inner sensations in the greatest body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1426</h4><p>1426. There was a certain spirit <sup>1</sup>who could talk with them in a ready manner - since I was in the body I could not represent things to them so quickly - and when he spoke with them, they then indeed said that this was well. Nevertheless, they at once judged that this was said too elegantly, that too cleverly, and so forth, so that they did not approve it as being in accordance with their mind. This is also a property of the internal sense, for this sense has its own perception, and these spirits immediately judge from themselves and their own nature. From the perception of that sense it could likewise be concluded that these spirits constituted the internal senses in the Grand Body. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;From parallel passages in AC 6924 and EU 23, it is evident that this spirit was from another planet. </p>

Cumque spiritus quidam <sup>1</sup></p><p>qui dextre cum iis loqui potuit, loqueretur cum iis, quia non potui tam celeriter, ego iis repraesentare res, quia in corpore, tunc dicebant quidem, quod hoc bene, sed usque judicabant illico, quod hoc nimis eleganter, hoc nimis scite, et sic, sic ut non approbarent esse ex eorum mente, quod etiam proprium est sensus interni, nam sensus internus suam perceptionem habet, et illico ex se et sua indole judicant; ex perceptione istius sensus quoque concludi potuit, quod sensus internos in maximo corpore, constituerent.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
