<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第339节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>339.关于穆罕默德和伊斯兰教徒。由于在天堂入口处的死人当中，有一些人愤愤地离开，去寻求另一个天堂，所以他们以为，除了弥赛亚神之外，还有别神在掌权，最后觉得自己似乎找到了另一个天堂，一个穆罕默德掌权的天堂。毫无疑问，他们曾与几年前死去的伊斯兰教徒交谈过。当他们将要把这个天堂指给他们想要迷惑的其他人看时，在我看来，好像在深渊处的另一个所谓天堂正在被打开。我从那里能听见他们说话。这时，我被教导说，他们是伊斯兰教徒，以为自己正来到自己的天堂，也就是说，要留在那里。我与他们交谈了一会儿后，弥赛亚神通过一位天使在荣耀中向他们显现。于是，他们俯伏在地，虔诚地崇拜。后来，穆罕默德（这个穆罕默德似乎不是《真实的基督教》所提到的写《古兰经》的那个穆罕默德，而是《最后的审判续》中所提到的那个）从那里被提上来，与我在一起，并谈了很多；我能见证，当他被教导关于弥赛亚神的事时，他说话谦逊，的确比许多基督徒谦逊多了。我能感觉他所说的就是他所想的。他还教导那些在深渊里的人说，他不能凭自己做任何事，并认识到他不是神，只是一个简单人，或许有些灵人与他交谈过了。他还想在正信的教义上接受指教。我甚至从两边，以及内部将阿姆斯特丹这个城市和那里的市政厅指给他看；他为大量的大理石雕像而感到惊奇。现在他就在场并肯定这个事实。（1747年12月14日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 339</h4><p>339. About Mohammed, and the Mohammedans<p>Because certain ones of the dead at the entrance to heaven drew away angrily in search of a different heaven, so they thought, where someone other than God the Messiah reigned, finally they imagined they had found another heaven, one where Mohammed reigned (no doubt they had talked to Mohammedans who had died some years before).<p>When they were about to show this heaven to others whom they wanted to lead away, it appeared to me as if another so-called heaven in the depth was being opened, from which I could hear them speaking. I was then informed that they were Mohammedans who imagined they were coming there to their own heaven, to stay there. After I had spoken with them for a while, God the Messiah appeared to them in glory, through an Angel, whereupon they fell on their faces in devout adoration.<p>After this Mohammed was quickly raised up from there, and was present with me and spoke with me at length; and I can bear witness that when he had been instructed about God the Messiah, he spoke kindly - and more kindly than many Christians (I could feel that he was speaking as he was thinking), and he instructed those who were in the depth that he could do nothing whatever from himself, and that he realized that he was no God, but a simple man, and that certain spirits had chanced to speak with him. He also wants to be instructed in the doctrine of true faith.<p>I even showed him the city of Amsterdam and the Town Hall there <sup>1</sup>from two sides, as well as inside, and he was amazed at the great number of marble works. He is now also present and affirms this fact. 1747, the 14th day of December.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. the Stadhuis. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 339</h4><p>339. CONCERNING MAHOMED <sup>1</sup>AND THE MAHOMEDANS <p>Because certain of the dead who were in the entrance to heaven were indignant, they went away to seek another heaven, as they supposed, where another than God Messiah reined, and at length they seemed to themselves to have found another heaven, namely, one over which Mahomed reigned. No doubt they spoke with Mahomedans who had been dead some years. When they wished to point this out to others whom they wanted to seduce, it then seemed to me that another so-called heaven was opened in the depth, whence I could hear them talking, and I was then instructed that they were Mahomedans who supposed that they were come there to their own heaven, that is, to be there. When I had spoken with them for some time, God Messiah appeared to them in glory by means of an angel. They then fell upon their faces and adored devoutly. Afterwards Mahomed was quickly raised up thence and was with me and spoke much with me, and I can testify that when he was instructed concerning God Messiah he spoke modestly, indeed more modestly than many Christians. I could feel that he thought in like manner. He also instructed these who were in the depth that he could do nothing whatever of himself, and that he perceived that he was no god, but a simple man, and that perhaps certain spirits had spoken with him. He also wants to be instructed in the doctrine of the true faith. I also showed him the city of Amsterdam and the City Hall <sup>2</sup>there from two aspects, also the interior, and he was surprised at the great number of marble [statues]. He is now also present and declares the same thing. 1747, Dec. 14. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Mahomed here spoken of seems to be the same as the one referred to in <a href="../clj/71.htm">Last Judgment (Posthumous) 71</a>, and is not the Mahomed who wrote the Koran and founded Islam. See <a href="../cl/344.htm">Conjugial Love 344</a>. <p>2.&nbsp;The City Hall (curia) here referred to is the Stadhuis which is said to be one of the finest buildings in Europe. Its walls are lined with Italian marble and adorned with many marble sculptures. </p>
