<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 630</h4><p>630. The angels must ever be perfected, and can never be perfect or holy<p>However it may be that souls are admitted into the very inward and the innermost heaven, yet they are not perfect, but some earthly element always clings to them which must be corrected. This is done when they are let back among spirits. Then it appears at once what residue from a rooted in nature they still retain, which is then corrected; and this betterment goes on by their being let back many times.<p>Therefore it is a rule that an angel can never be perfected to a point where he can be called perfect and holy, thus never to eternity. The only perfect and holy person is the Lord, Who is Perfection and Holiness Itself. 1748, the 2nd day of February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 630</h4><p>630. THAT THE ANGELS ARE ALWAYS BEING PERFECTED, BUT THEY CAN NEVER BE PERFECT OR HOLY <p>However much souls are admitted into the more interior and inmost heaven, still they are not perfect, but there always adheres something natural which must be amended. This is effected when they are sent back among spirits. It then at once appears what residue from the natural root they still retain, and this is then amended. And so it continues through many times of being sent back, so that it is a rule that an angel can never be so perfected to eternity that he can be said to be perfect and holy. The only one who is perfect and holy is the Lord who is Perfection and Holiness itself. 1748, Feb. 2. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 630 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>630. De angelis, quod semper perficiendi et quod nusquam perfecti seu sancti esse queant<p>Utcunque in coelum intimius ac intimum admittuntur animae, usque non perfecti sunt, sed semper aliquid naturale adhaeret, quod emendandum, quod fit, dum inter spiritus remittuntur, tunc illico apparet, quid residui ex naturali radice adhuc retinent, quod tunc emendatur, et sic porro, per plures remissionis vices, sic ut regula sit, quod nusque <sup>1</sup></p><p>perfici queat angelus, ut perfectus et sanctus dici possit, sic nusquam in aeternum, solus perfectus et <sup>2</sup></p><p>sanctus est Dominus, Qui est Ipsa Pertectio et Sanctitas. 1748, d. 2 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
