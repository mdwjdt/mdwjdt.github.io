<p>325.魔鬼团伙不仅完全没有能力，而且还能意识到这一事实，承认并认可它，甚至似乎没什么不情愿。我今天从经历获知，就连在信之真理的事上最为愚蠢的魔鬼团伙的灵人也不得不承认，他们知道这是事实，即：他们凭自己什么也做不了。他们完全承认这一点，事实上不仅口头上承认，甚至出于一种确信承认。然而，后来他们感到羞愧。（1747年12月9日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 325</h4><p>325. The diabolic gang are not only utterly powerless, but can even realize it is true, and admit and acknowledge it - even as if it were not against their will to do so<p>This I learned today from experience, that even spirits of the diabolic gang who are otherwise most stupid in matters of true belief, were nevertheless forced to admit that they knew it was true they could do nothing from themselves. They fully acknowledged this, and in fact, not [just] with the mouth, but even from a certain conviction. Afterwards, however, they were ashamed. 1747, the 9th day of December. </p>

This they altogether acknowledged, and indeed not [only] from the mouth, but also from a certain persuasion. Afterwards, however, they were ashamed. 1747, Dec. 9. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The number commences in the MS. with the following words crossed out: "There were certain of the devil's crew around me, who to a certain one not long dead..." </p>

Quod diaboli turba non solum nihil valeant, sed etiam percipere possint quid verum, et id fateri et agnoscere, et quidem tanquam non invito<p>Hoc hodie ab experientia edoctus sum, quod etiam ii ex diaboli turba, quae alioquin in iis quae verae fidei sunt, stupidissimi, usque redigebantur fateri quod scirent id verum esse, quod nihil possent a semet, quod agnoscebant prorsus, et quidem non ex ore, sed etiam ex quadam persuasione; postea tamen pudefacti sunt. 1747, die 9 Dec. </p>
