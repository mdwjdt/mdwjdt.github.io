<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第600节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>600.关于天堂里的一种总体荣耀。在相当长的一段时间里，我一直被保持在一种总体的广阔视野中，这几乎使我退离了个人或物质的观念。可以说，附近出现了一道活泼、耀眼的光芒，就像钻石的光芒，而且持续了很长一段时间。我无法以其它任何方式来描述这种光，因为它是非常普遍的，它把我引离肉体的观念，事实上从肉体中抽离出来。当我在它里面时，我看见肉体事物仿佛在我下面；我的确感觉到它们，但好像它们从我身上被移走了，不属于我，因而不是我的一部分。有几次灵人和魔鬼说我不在他们身边，他们不知道我在哪里，也不知道我在想什么。他们抱怨说，我就这样从他们那里被移走了，因为他们与我交谈，并通过直接交流与我为一的乐趣消失了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 600</h4><p>600. About a collective glorification in the heavens<p>For quite a long time I was kept in a broad vision, which almost withdrew me from personal ideas, or those on the bodily plane. There appeared a kind of lively sparkling of light nearby, like the light of diamonds, and this continued for quite a long time. I cannot describe that light in any other way, for it was very general, and it drew me away from ideas on the bodily plane, in fact, from the body. When I was in it, then I was looking at bodily things as if below me, and I did feel them, but as if remote from me and not belonging to me, and thus not being part of me.<p>Several times, the spirits and demons said that I was absent from them, and that they did not know where I was, nor what I was thinking. They complained that because of this, I was being removed from them, and thus the gladness which they had felt from speaking with me, and from being one with me through direct communication, had passed away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 600</h4><p>600. CONCERNING A GENERAL GLORYING IN HEAVEN <p>For quite a time I was kept in a general vision which almost withdrew me from particular or corporeal ideas. There appeared, as it were, a vivid sparkling of light nearby, as though it were an adamantine light, and this for quite a time. I am unable to describe that light in any other manner, for it was general, and it withdrew me from corporeal ideas, indeed, from the body. When I was in it, I regarded corporeal things as beneath me; I indeed felt them but as if they were removed from, and did not pertain to me, thus as not communicating with me. The spirits and genii sometimes said that I was absent from them, and they did not know where I was, nor what I was thinking. They complained that I was thus removed from them, for the pleasure they had in speaking with me, and being one with me by immediate communications, perished. </p>

De gloriatione communi in coelis<p>Diu satis detentus sum in visione communi, quae paene abduxit me ab ideis particularibus, seu corporeis, apparuit quasi scintillatio viva lucis contigua <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quasi lux adamantina, et hoc satis diu, istam lucem non possum describere aliter, nam communis erat, et abduxit me ab ideis corporeis, imo a corpore; quando in illa essem, tunc spectabam corporea tanquam infra me, quae quidem sentiebam, sed sicut remota a me, et ad me non pertinentia, sic mecum non communicantia, dicebant spiritus et genii, aliquoties, quod abessem ab illis, et nescirent <sup>2</sup></p><p>ubinam essem, et quid cogitarem; conquesti, quod sic removerer ab iis, sic periit eorum laetitia, quam habuerunt mecum loquendi <sup>3</sup></p><p>, et unum esse mecum per communicationes immediatas.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has lucis qs, contigua; J.F.l. in Tafel's edition: "lucis pro lucis se"<p>2.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
