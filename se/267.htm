<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>267.被派到一个世人那里的灵人以他们就是那个他们所来到的那个人。一些灵人升到我这里，声称他们从一开始就与我在一起，因此他们就是那些从起初与我说话的人。我因不认识他们，所以很是愤慨，并斥责了他们。最终他们承认，他们刚刚是第一次来，但他们可以说披上他们所来到的那人的一切，以致他们以为自己从一开始就与他\她在一起。令人惊奇的是，一个灵人瞬间就能披上属于此人的一切，他的知识、语言等等，就好像他从一开始就拥有它们。我与灵人还时不时地谈论这个话题。（1747年11月24日)</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 267</h4><p>267. Spirits who are sent to a person on earth think they are the person to whom they come<p>Certain spirits, by ascending, came to me, saying that they had been with me from the beginning, thus that they were the ones who have spoken with me from the start. When I became indignant and rebuked them, because I did not recognize them, they finally admitted that they had just come for the first time, but that they put on, so to speak, everything of the person, so that they think they had been with him or her from the beginning.<p>It is amazing, but a spirit puts on in a moment a person's characteristics, knowledge, language, and the like, just as if he had possessed them from the beginning. About this subject I have conversed with spirits also from time to time. 1747, the 24th day of November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 267</h4><p>267. SPIRITS WHO ARE SENT TO MAN SUPPOSE THAT THEY ARE THE MAN TO WHOM THEY COME <p>Certain spirits, ascending, came to me today saying that they had been with me from the beginning, thus that they were those who had spoken with me from the first; at this I was indignant and scolded them, for I did not acknowledge it. They at length confessed that they had now first come, but that they put on as it were all things of the man to whom they come, so that they suppose that they have been with him from the beginning. It is marvelous that in a moment a spirit puts on the things which are of the man - his knowledges, his language and the like - just as though he had possessed them from the beginning; concerning these things I have also spoken with spirits on various occasions. 1747, Nov. 24, o.s. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 267 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>267. Spiritus qui ad hominem mittuntur, putant se hominem esse, ad quem veniunt<p>Spiritus quidam hodie venerunt ad me ascendendo dicentes quod apud me fuerint a principio, ita quod ii essent, qui a primis loquuti mecum sint, quod cum indignatus, eos increpans, quia non agnoscebam, tandem fassi sunt, quod nunc primum venissent, sed quod induerent quasi omnia hominis, ut putarent se apud eum a principio fuisse; mirabile est, quod spiritus momento induat ea quae hominis sunt ejus scientifica, linguam, et similia, sicut ea possedisset a principio, de quibus etiam cum spiritibus passim loquutus sum. 1747, die 24 Nov. st. v. </p>
