<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4374</h4><p>4374. About innocence, and about hell<p>About a hypocrite<p>In a conversation on the state of innocence, a hypocrite - because he had learned to imitate innocence during his life, even to copy the very feeling, so that those who were immersed in outer qualities would be attracted by an appearance of goodness and innocence - was told that he cannot so much as approach toward a state of innocence without encountering a more severe hell than he could ever think possible. He was also shown, because he was also a speaker of falsehood, that it would be as if thousands of points sharper than swords and spears would inwardly pierce him if he only came near to it, so that a more severe hell awaits him than others, for he had had no conscience in killing innocent people, a deed which he had twice considered. 1749, 24 Aug.<p>He was led to the first threshold of the state of goodness, and there he was so strongly affected with anguish of mind that he cried out that he was fainting, even though he had imitated goodness, and had been able to imitate it with the mouth and outer feeling. And it was strange, that there was outer, but not inward feeling, for when filthy inward qualities passed to outer ones, they were changed in this way. 1749, 24 Aug. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Saturn, meaning Saturday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4374</h4><p>4374. CONCERNING INNOCENCE, AND CONCERNING HELL. CONCERNING A HYPOCRITE.<p>While conversing respecting the state of innocence, it was said to a hypocrite who had learned in his life time to feign innocence, even the very affection itself, that although those who were in [decent] externals, might, under the show of goodness and innocence, be somewhat drawn [heavenwards]; yet, that as to himself he could not even approach to the state of innocence, but would find upon attempting it a more grievous hell than he was able to conceive. It was shown, moreover, as he was addicted to false speaking, that if he approximated thither, he would be inwardly pierced, as it were, by a thousand needles, swords, and spears, so that a severer hell would await him than others, inasmuch as he had no conscience to withhold him from murdering the innocent, respecting which he had in fact twice entertained the thought. - 1749, August 24. Being led to the threshold of the state of goodness, he was seized with such anguish of mind as forced him to cry out that he should swoon away. Still he was one that could and did feign goodness both in countenance and external affection; and it was indeed surprising that so much external affection could be present, while the internal was wholly lacking; but defiled interiors, when they pass to exteriors, often assume this aspect. - 1749, August 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4374 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4374. De innocentia, et de inferno<p>De hypocrita<p>Cum sermo de innocentiae statu, dictum hypocritae, quia innocentiam effingere didicit in vita, imo ita ut fingere ipsam affectionem, ut qui in externis essent, attraherentur sub specie bonitatis et innocentiae, sed ei dictum quod ne quidem approximare ad innocentiae statum possit, quod ibi offenderet gravius infernum quam usquam cogitare posset, ostensum etiam, quia falsiloquus etiam, quod sicut millia acutiorum quam ensium, et cuspidum eum intus lacerarent, si modo approximaret illuc, quare gravius infernum eum manet quam alios, nam nullam conscientiam habuit insontes necare, de quo etiam bis consultavit. 1749, 24 Aug. Ductus ad primum limen ubi status bonitatis, et ibi angustia animi ita affectus, ut clamaret quod deficeret, tametsi bonitatem effinxit, et effingere potuisset ore et externa affectione, et mirum, quod externa affectio esset, sed non interior, nam spurca interiora cum transirent ad externa, ita mutabantur. 1749, 24 Aug. </p>
