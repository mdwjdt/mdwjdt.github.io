<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2279</h4><p>2279. This all made it clear to me that such obsessions by spirits cannot work at this day in the same way on one who has faith, that is to say, one does not behave as an insane person, or act as the prophets of old did, who were out of control. But one could still be similarly possessed by spirits, and yet be in control, that is, of one's own understanding and one's own will. For those who have faith in the Lord cannot be possessed by spirits in regard to their faculties of thinking and acting. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2279</h4><p>2279. From these things it could also be plain to me that such obsessions of spirits at this day could not act similarly in a man who is in faith, to wit, that he himself does not carry on insanely [non insanum gerere], and is not such as the prophets of old who had no power over themselves [qui impotes sue erant], but that yet he could be similarly possessed by spirits, and notwithstanding be his own master [sui juris], that is to say, of his intellect and his will; for those who are in faith in the Lord cannot be possessed by spirits as to their faculty [ejus for eorum, I think] of thought and action. - 1748, June 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2279 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2279. Ex iis mihi quoque constare potuit, quod tales spirituum obsessiones hodie, non similiter agere possint in homine, qui in fide, scilicet semet non insanum gerere [possit], et talis esse, quales prophetae veteres, qui impotes sui erant, sed quod usque similiter potuerit possideri a spiritibus, et nihilominus sui juris esse, nempe sui intellectus, et suae voluntatis, nam qui in fide in Dominum, non possideri possunt a spiritibus quoad suam <sup>1</sup></p><p>facultatem cogitandi, agendique. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ejus </p>
