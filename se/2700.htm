<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2700</h4><p>2700. Such spirits were with me, (Solomon), and when he was present, all the spirits were compelled to go away to a distance so as not to be veiled over by that misty aura spoken of earlier [<a href="2681.htm">2681</a>, <a href="2683.htm">2683-2685</a>]. But as long as they were there, close above my head, or standing with their feet on my head, the spirits were extremely distressed, as they said several times. They could not bear anything that those [haughty] spirits were saying, being thus dislodged from their licentious state into a state of a kind of servitude that they absolutely could not endure. The auras in the spiritual world are arranged according to their inclinations and attitudes, and so are others in respect to them, thus with infinite variety. In human affairs likewise, for those who want to be free cannot stand the society of such people, either, but tear themselves away, being distressed in their company. 1748, 28 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2700</h4><p>2700. Lest they should be covered up with such a cloudy [nebulosa] sphere as was previously described: but so long as these [proud ones] were above my head, near [me] with [their] feet standing on my head, spirits as they several times said, were very greatly distressed: they could not endure anything which [such proud ones spoke]: the state of their freedom [licentioe] into a state of a kind of servitude, which they were not at all able to endure. Thus spheres in the spiritual world are circumstanced according to their genius and mind, and thus are others respectively related to them: thus with infinite variety. It is similar amongst men, for they who wish to be free, cannot endure the society of those who are of such a nature, but take themselves away, for they are distressed in their society. - 1748, July 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2700 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2700. Tales fuerunt apud me, (Salomo), et cum aderat is, omnes spiritus in longinquum cogebantur abire, ne obvelarentur tali sphaera nebulosa, de qua prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2700/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2681" target=_top>2681</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2700/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2683" target=_top>2683-2685</a>], sed quamdiu ii erant, super capite meo, prope, pedibus insistentes capiti, spiritus, sicut aliquoties dicebant, quammaxime angebantur, non potuerunt sustinere quicquam quod [ii] loquerentur, e statu suae licentiae, ita deturbati, in statum generis servitutis, quam sufferere {a} nequaquam poterant; ita habent se sphaerae in mundo spirituali, secundum genios et animos eorum, et ita se habent alii respective ad eos, ita cum infinita varietate; similiter se habet res inter homines, qui enim liberi volunt esse, nec sustinent societatem eorum, qui tales sunt, sed se eripiunt, nam anguntur in societate eorum. 1748, 28 Julius. </p>
