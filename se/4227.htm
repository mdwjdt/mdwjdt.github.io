<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4227</h4><p>4227. Discussion with those who had believed that faith alone saves, without works<p>It was shown me how numerous those were who had so believed. They are above around the left side of the brain, quite high up. First I was shown the region in front, and from these progressing almost all the way around, where I spoke with them. They were the kind who had believed that faith alone saves apart from good works. Because I had said that charity saves, and had proffered many other points regarding charity, they had been attacking me throughout the night, for those of this faith, especially their priests, are strongly vindictive, (which they were also told), and it seldom fails, if anyone comes up against them, but that he or she is punished; so they are unforgiving. This was also evident to me from how tenaciously they persisted in attacking me the whole night long, and in the morning wanted to repeat even more stubbornly that they had been doing before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4227</h4><p>4227. A DISCOURSE WITH THOSE WHO BELIEVED THAT FAITH ALONE WITHOUT WORKS WERE SAVING.<p>It was shown me how numerous they are who entertain this belief. They are above and round about the left region of the brain at a very considerable height. Their aspect in front was first shown me, and from these I was led almost round [to the opposite side], and then spoke with them; they were such as believed in salvation by faith alone without good works. From my saying that charity was what saved, and from dwelling at some length upon charity, they infested me during the whole night, for they are strongly vindictive, as is the case with priests who are in that faith, as was said to them, nor do they fail, if one does aught in opposition to them, to inflict punishment upon them. That they are thus unforgiving was clearly evinced to me from the fact, that they persisted so tenaciously in infesting me during the whole night, and that in the morning they were just as intent upon it as before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4227 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4227. Sermo cum iis qui crediderunt solam fidem absque operibus salvare<p>Ostensum mihi quam multi essent, qui ita crediderunt, sunt supra circum sinistram partem cerebri alte satis, ostensum mihi primum antrorsum, tunc ab iis progrediendo fere circum circum, et cum iis loquutus, fuerunt tales qui solam fidem salvare absque bonis operibus crediderunt; ii ex eo quod charitatem dixi salvare, et quia plura de charitate, infestarunt me tota nocte, nam tenaces vindictae sunt, ut plurimum sacerdotes, qui tali fide sunt, quod etiam iis dictum, raro omittunt, si quis contra eos quid facit, quin puniatur, ita non condonant, id quoque constabat mihi ex eo, quod tam tenaciter inhaerebant tota nocte me infestare, et quod mane repetere vellent tenacius id quod prius. </p>
