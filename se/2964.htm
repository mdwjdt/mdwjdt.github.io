<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2964</h4><p>2964. What the bonds are that hold spirits<p>I spoke with spirits about the restraints in which they are held. They neither know nor therefore acknowledge that they are held in bonds. In order that an idea of bonds may be had, a bond was suggested by which people are customarily held in everyday life, as when one lends to someone, demanding nothing in return, then the other is held in the bond of speaking, and of thinking well of him, and of respecting him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2964</h4><p>2964. WHAT [ARE] THE BONDS, WHEREBY [IN] SPIRITS ARE HELD. <p>I spoke with spirits concerning the bonds wherein they are held. They do not know, and, therefore, do not acknowledge that they are held in bonds. In order that the idea of bonds may be entertained [habeatur] there was presented a bond wherein men are accustomed to be held in general life, as when [anyone] gives mutually to another, and does not demand a return; the other is then held in bond to speak and think well of him, and to highly esteem him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2964 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2964. Quid vincula quibus tenentur spiritus<p>Loquutus cum spiritibus de vinculis in quibus tenentur, nec sciunt, nec ideo agnoscunt, quod teneantur in vinculis; ut idea vinculorum habeatur, proponebatur vinculum quo teneri solent homines in vita communi, sicut dum [unus] mutuo alicui dat, nec reposcit, alter tunc tenetur in vinculo de eo bene loquendi, cogitandique, aestimandique. </p>
