<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5816</h4><p>5816. After this all these who were in heaven were sent down. And it was shown that those on the mountains and hills had elevated themselves to higher positions through fantasies, and that they were not there; for to the angels of heaven who were with me they appeared below me in their own place and not above. This was because the angels did not see them where they were through fantasies, but where they were bodily, and this was below such [angels] down at ground level. When they were there, they were seen. Even now they were concealed in a cloud of falsities, and after that by earth, and thus were covered. Those who were not so evil were there, up to many thousands; those who were evil beneath them in a deeper similar place were seen by me; they appeared to be in mountains. When I looked there from an angel's point of view, then those who had appeared above and high up earlier were now all lower down. The evil, when so seen, were quite deep in the hells. Those who were kept hidden underground in this way were for the most part those who were roundabout under the world of spirits, some around the southwestern region, some to the northwestern region, and so forth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5816</h4><p>5816. After this, all who were in that heaven were let down; and it was shown that those in the mountains and hills raised themselves up thither by means of phantasies, and that they were not there; for they appeared, before the angels of heaven who were with me, below me, in their own places, and not above; because these did not see them where they were by phantasies, but where they were in the body; and this was beneath such ones, on the level of the ground. When they were seen there, they were also hidden in a cloud arising from their falsities, and afterwards in the ground; and thus were covered up - in that place, those who were not so bad, to the number of many myriads, and those who were bad, below these, in a similar depth, which was seen by me. When I looked from angelic sight, upon those who appeared in the mountains, those who previously appeared above and on high, were all beneath. The evil, when so seen, were quite deep in the hells. Those who were thus hidden under the earths, were mostly those who were good - these were roundabout under the world of spirits; others were about the south-western quarter; others to the north-western quarter; and so forth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5816 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5816. Postea omnes qui in coelo illo erant, demissi sunt, et ostensum est quod illi in montes et colles se evexerint per phantasias, et quod non ibi essent, nam apparebant coram angelis coeli qui apud me infra me in suo loco, et non supra, quia ibi non videbant illos ubi erant per phantasias, sed ubi corpore, et hoc erat infra tales ad terram planam, cum ibi visi sunt, etiam operti sunt nube ex falsis, et postea terra, et sic cooperti, qui non ita mali ibi, ad plures myriades, qui mali infra illos in profundiore simile visum a me [,] qui in montibus apparebant, cum intuebar illuc ex visu angelico, tunc erant omnes infra, qui prius apparuerunt supra et alte. Mali cum ita visi erant satis profunde in infernis. Qui ita sub terris recondebantur erant plerique qui boni circumcirca sub mundo spirituum, alii circa plagam meridionalem occidentalem, alii ad plagam occidentalem septentrionalem, et sic porro. </p>
