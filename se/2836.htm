These faculties in mankind appear as one, and by those who do not know better, they are attributed to the body alone and thought not to be distinct from each other, consequently not separable. Nevertheless, I am able to reveal that I know from manifold experience that this is so, and that the life of the outward faculties belongs to the inward ones next in order, and the life of the inward ones to the more inward, [and the life of the more inward to the innermost,] and that the life of these [all] belongs to the Lord Alone. Thus people think they live from themselves, just as their inward spirit thinks it is living in the body. 1748, 16 Aug. </p>

These faculties in man appear as one, and by the ignorant are attributed to the body alone, and [they suppose] that they are not distinct from each other, hence, not separable; when yet I can acknowledge that I know from manifold experience that it is so, and that the life of the exteriors is [from] the order of the interiors, and the interior life is of the more interior [lives], and that the life of man is of the Lord Alone. Thus man supposes he lives from himself, like as his interior spirit supposes that it lives in the body. - 1748, August 16. </p>
