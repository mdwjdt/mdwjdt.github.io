<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1470</h4><p>1470. About the speech of the heavenly angels<p>The language of the heavenly angels is different from that of the spiritual. The heavenly hardly let anything spiritual enter, for it at once appears as hard or material.<p>This is done by portrayals. For example, when the human mind is portrayed as being in two parts, understanding and will, and when the understanding is depicted and then the will, then it appears hard to them and they will not allow it to enter, because they have no mental image of it. But when affection is portrayed, then immediately everything hard and material passes away, and they let it enter.<p>And then when it is portrayed that affection is within the understanding so that nothing of intellect shows, and that intellect is the form of affection, so that it becomes will, and thus the spiritual or intellectual mental image of will passes away, then it is understood by them what will is.<p>Likewise, when action is then portrayed as being affection that is within the understanding, then in the will, and from there in action, so that there is nothing but affection-provided this affection constitutes its more inward aspects and thus actually is the first and the following-only then is it understood by them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1470</h4><p>1470. CONCERNING THE SPEECH OF THE CELESTIAL ANGELS <p>The speech of the celestial angels is different from that of the spiritual. The celestial admit scarcely anything spiritual, for what is spiritual at once appears as something hard or material. This is effected by representations, as when the human mind is represented as to its two parts, namely the understanding and will. When the understanding is represented, and then the will, it appears to them as something hard which they do not admit for they have no idea of it; but when affection is represented everything hard and material immediately perishes, and this they do admit. When it is represented in such a manner that affection is within the understanding so that nothing intellectual appears - the intellectual being the form of the affection and thus becoming the will, so that the spiritual or intellectual idea of the will perishes - then do the celestial angels understand what the will is. It is similar when action is so represented that it is such as is the affection which is in the understanding, and thus in the will, and hence in the action, so that there is nothing but affection; provided that the affection constitutes its more interior things, and so is the one and the other. Then first is this understood by them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1470 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1470. De loquela angelorum coelestium<p>Loquela angelorum coelestium alia est quam spiritualium, coelestes aegre admittunt aliquid spirituale, nam id illico ut durum seu materiale apparet, fit per repraesentationes, sicut, cum repraesentatur mens humana, quod ejus binae sint partes, nempe intellectus et voluntas, quando repraesentatur intellectus, tum voluntas, tunc iis ut durum apparet, nec admittunt, quia ejus non habent ideam; at dum [repraesentetur] affectio, tunc illico omne durum et materiale perit, hoc admittunt; cumque sic repraesentatur, quod affectio insit intellectui, ut sic nihil intellectuale appareat, et sic intellectuale forma affectionis, et sic quod inde fiat voluntas, et sic voluntatis idea spiritualis seu intellectualis pereat, ita intelligitur ab iis, quid voluntas: similiter dum actio sic repraesentetur, quod talis sit affectio, quae est in intellectu, et sic in voluntate, inde in actione, sic ut nihil sit nisi affectio-modo <sup>1</sup></p><p>haec constituat intimiora <sup>2</sup></p><p>ejus, et sic sit unum et alterum {a}-tunc <sup>3</sup></p><p>primum ab iis intelligitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has affectio, modo<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has primum intimiora<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has alterum, tunc </p>
