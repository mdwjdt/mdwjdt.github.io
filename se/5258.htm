I saw that they were brought down from the west. And those who were round about there, amounting a great multitude, were brought the east by a northward way, on what appeared be a circular route; along the route those who were evil were thrown outside this region, where there is a vast space.

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE MOHAMMEDANS AND THEIR LAST JUDGMENT. <p>It has been stated above [No. <a href="../se/5240.htm">5240</a> that these constitute a circle around the Christians, who form a nucleus. I saw that they were brought from the west; and they who were round about there, as much as a great multitude, were brought along a way towards the north-east, apparently in a circular track; and, on the way, those who were evil were cast outside that sphere, where is a space of great extent. These were separated from the rest. There was a desert there, also marshes and ponds, and woods as well; and into these those who led an evil life were cast. This space was at the back of that mountain of which I have spoken just above, where was such a multitude of monasteries which were destroyed with the mountain. At the side of that space, towards the north, was an immense and broad gulf, into which many were cast - of whom below. </p>

Continuatio de Mahumedanis et eorum ultimo judicio<p>Dictum supra quod illi ambitum faciant circum Christianos, qui faciunt nucleum; vidi quod illi deducti sint ab occidente, et qui ibi circumcirca ad multam multitudinem per viam versus septentrionem, ad orientem, in circulari via ad apparentiam, et qui mali in via conjecti sunt extra sphaeram illam, ubi spatium multae extensionis, qui separabantur a reliquis, ibi erat desertum, et ibi paludes, et stagna, tum sylvae, in illa conjecti sunt illi qui malam vitam egerunt; hoc spatium erat a tergo montis illius, de quo mox supra [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5258/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5249" target=_top>5249-5257</a>] ubi tanta multitudo monasteriorum, quae deleta cum monte; a latere spatii illius versus septentrionem erat vorago ingens et extensa, in quam conjecti plures, de quibus infra. </p>
