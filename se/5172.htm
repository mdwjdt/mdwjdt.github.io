<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5172</h4><p>5172. About the state of the lowest heaven<p>I spoke with them about their state. They said that there are various kinds of people among them, but that they were told apart by the fact that each kind always goes about in its characteristic attire, without changing except on the customary days, and that their houses and the way they look do not change much either outside or inside, and that they are judged [on the basis of these characteristics]. The reason is that those people act in a definite way and always turn to their own personal loves. But when they see someone's appearance and clothing change, they know that is not good to be with them. They call them delusional, because they change their clothing and appearance according to the region. They change themselves without a particular purpose. Such people appear there sometimes, but in a short time they disappear. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5172</h4><p>5172. CONCERNING THE STATE OF THE LOWEST HEAVEN.<p>I spoke with them concerning their state. They said that there are men of various kinds amongst them; but that they are distinguished by this: - that they who constantly walk about in their own proper clothing, without change, except on the customary days, and with whom the house, and outer and inner prospect, do not vary much, are esteemed. The reason is, because these act determinately, and turn themselves to their own loves, constantly. But, when they see certain ones changed, as regards the clothing and face, they know it is not well with them. They call those who change their clothing and their face according to the regions [they are in], and turn themselves undecidedly, fantastics. Such appear, there, sometimes; but they shortly vanish. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5172 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5172. De statu coeli ultimi<p>Loquutus sum cum illis de statu eorum; dicebant quod apud illos sint homines varii generis, sed quod dignoscantur ex eo, quod qui in vestitu suo constanter ambulant, absque mutatione, solum diebus solennibus, et apud quos domus et prospectus extra et intra non variant multum, quod illi aestimentur, causa est, quia illi determinate agunt, seque vertunt ad suos amores constanter: at quum vident aliquos mutari quoad vestes, et quoad facies, quod sciant cum illis non bene esse, vocant illos phantastas, quia mutant suas vestes, et suas facies secundum plagas, vertunt se absque determinatione, tales apparent ibi quandoque, sed evanescunt brevi. </p>
