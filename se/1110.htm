<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1110</h4><p>1110. Those who for some selfish reason want to kill innocent people,<p>or hurt them in any way, are hurrying along the road to hell<p>There were spirits whom I took to be good, because they were in company with good ones. From some covetous desire to claim for themselves things belonging to good and innocent people, which was their intent while they were still in company with the good, they suddenly hurried onto a road at the back, toward hell. I was surprised at this, because I had suspected no such thing.<p>I was told that every attempt and intention of this kind, namely, of grabbing innocent people's life and rightful possessions away from them, has hell within it. This is the reason they hurried onto a road toward hell. 1748, 1 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1110</h4><p>1110. THOSE WHO WANT TO KILL THE INNOCENT OR TO INJURE THEM IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER FOR THE SAKE OF THEMSELVES, SEIZE UPON THE WAY TOWARDS HELL <p>Some spirits whom I deemed to be good because they were in the company of good spirits, suddenly, from the cupidity of claiming to themselves the things which pertain to the good and innocent, with which desire they were imbued when still in the company of the good spirits, betook themselves to the way at the back, towards hell. This surprised me, as I had not suspected any such thing. It was said to me that every such effort and purpose, namely, the effort and purpose of depriving the innocent of their life and of the rights which they justly possess, has hell in itself, which is the reason that those spirits seized upon the way towards hell. 1748, Mar. 1. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1110 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1110. Qui innocentes volunt interimere, aut quocunque modo laedere, sui causa, viam versus infernum corripiunt<p>Erant spiritus, quos opinatus sum bonos, quia in consortio cum bonis, ii ex quadam cupiditate vindicandi sibi ea, quae ad bonos ac innocentes pertinebant, quo animo praediti, cum adhuc in consortio cum bonis essent, subito corripiebant viam a tergo, versus infernum, quod miratus, quia tale non suspicatus, dictum est mihi, quod omnis talis conatus et animus, nempe praeripiendi innocentibus eorum vitam, et quod possident jure, in se habeat, infernum, quae causa est, quod viam versus infernum corripuerint. 1748, 1 Martius. </p>
