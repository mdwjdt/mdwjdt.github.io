<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3530</h4><p>3530. Mutual love in heaven is such that they love the neighbor more than themselves<p>This can be seen as in a reflected image from true marriage love, in that a husband loves his partner more than himself, undergoes death for her sake, bestows on her all his goods, would rather give to her than have for himself. It can also be seen from the love of parents for their children, evident to everyone, in that a mother would rather suffer hunger herself than let her little child so suffer. The same is true of wild beasts and birds, which look after their offspring before themselves. The same applies again to true friendships, in that people will suffer death for a friend, would rather serve the friend than themselves; then out of common courtesy, which derives from mutual love, showing it outwardly, when people serve others the better portions, taking the poorer ones for themselves. Then also it is seen in the case of deposits and loans, in that those who are upright guard and preserve the neighbor's assets better than their own. 1748, 10 Oct.<p>It is also seen from the very nature of love, which is such that it wishes to give of itself to others, that one's joy is in serving the other, not oneself. When there is a plurality of such, then there is mutual love, because a similar love reciprocates. But they cannot grasp this who love themselves above others and are eager for gain, least of all the greedy. Therefore those having mutual love are images of the Lord. These words were written in the presence of spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3530</h4><p>3530. THAT MUTUAL LOVE IN HEAVEN IS TO LOVE THE NEIGHBOR BETTER THAN ONE'S SELF.<p>This may be seen in shadow from true conjugial love, in that a husband loves his partner better than himself; that he will undergo death for her; that he will lay out upon her all his goods; that he will give to her rather than [take for] himself. So also from the love of parents towards their children, as it is known to everyone, that a mother will suffer hunger herself rather than that her infant shall go without food. The beasts and birds, in like manner, are more solicitous for their offspring than for themselves. Thus too from true friendships, when one will die for his friend, and will serve him in every way before himself. So likewise from common civility, which draws its origin from this source, and in which mutual love is externally evinced by giving better portions, dishes, &c., to another, and taking the poorer to one's self. And finally from deposits and loans, when those that are upright will guard and preserve what belongs to their neighbor more carefully than they do what is their own. - 1748, October 10. The same thing appears from the nature of love, which is such that it wishes to give itself to others, and its joy is to serve another and not itself: when there are many such there is mutual love, for what is similar is reciprocal. But they cannot receive this who love themselves supremely, or who are greedy of lucre, least of all the avaricious. Thus is the Lord [in his love] shadowed forth. These things are said in the presence of spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3530 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3530. Quod amor mutuus in coelo sit, ut ament proximum prae semet<p>Hoc in imagine videri potest, ab amore conjugiali vero, quod conjugem amet prae se, pro ea mortem subeat, omnia bona sua impendat, det ei potius quam sibi; ex amore parentum erga liberos, quod constat unicuique, quod mater potius famem patiatur, quam ut infans, simile apud bestias et aves quae prolem prospiciunt prae se: in amicitiis veris similiter, quod mortem pro amico subeant; quod ei potius inserviant quam sibi; tum ex civilitate communi, inde trahente originem, quia sic ostenditur externe amor mutuus, quod portiones meliores eis dent, et sibi viliores sumant: tum ex depositis et mutuis, [quod] qui sinceri sunt, quod proximi custodiant et conservent melius, quam suum. 1748, 10 Oct. Tum ex natura amoris, qui talis ut semet dare velit aliis; et quod gaudium ejus sit, non sibi sed alii inservire: cum plures tales, tunc est amor mutuus, quia reciprocus similis. Sed hoc non possunt capere, qui se amant prae aliis, et lucri avidi sunt, minime omnium avari: ita sunt imagines Domini. Haec in praesentia spirituum. </p>
