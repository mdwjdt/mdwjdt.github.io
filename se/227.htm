<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>227.关于神迹：若没有信仰，它们不会产生任何效果。我与一位天使交谈，还谈到神迹这个话题，即：对不信的人来说，它们不会产生任何效果，就像一吹即散的风，因为这类人里面没有任何与神迹有关的东西。雅各的后代在出了埃及，靠近红海，以及后来越过红海之后就是这种不信的人。一些灵人声称他们想看到神迹，这样他们就会相信；但他们得到的答复是：信仰是内在的东西，扎根于人的内在；而人的内在毫不关心神迹，甚至鄙视它们；但对那些没有信仰的人来说，神迹从来生不出任何根来。当与灵人讨论这些和类似的事时，灵人能很好且更充分地理解它们。他们能看到完整的意义，连同前因后果；这意义还能通过一种代表和想象而加固；代表和想象是天使言语的形式。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 227</h4><p>227. About miracles: they accomplish nothing where there is no faith<p>I spoke with a certain angel, and the subject of miracles also came up, [namely,] that they accomplish nothing whatever in disbelievers, being like a wind that touches, and is dispelled. For there is nothing within such persons to which [the miracles] relate. The descendents of Jacob were such [disbelievers] right after the exit from Egypt, near the sea of Suph; <sup>1</sup>and also later, when they had crossed over the sea.<p>Certain spirits said that miracles were what they wanted to see so that they would believe, and they received the reply, yes, but belief is on the inside, and takes root in the inner parts of a person; it does not care for miracles, it despises them, but in those who do not have faith, miracles can never produce any root.<p>These and similar matters are better and more fully grasped when discussed with spirits, who see the entire meaning, together with the antecedents and consequents; also, the meaning is reinforced by a kind of symbolic display and imagery, which is a form of angelic speech. 1747, the 30th day of October (old calendar).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. the Red Sea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 227</h4><p>227. CONCERNING MIRACLES WITHOUT FAITH THEY EFFECT NOTHING <p>I spoke with a certain angel, and there came up the subject of miracles, that they never effect anything with unbelievers. They are like wind which touches and is gone, for within there is nothing to which they may refer themselves, as it was with the posterity of Jacob immediately after they went forth out of Egypt, in the region of the Sea Suph, and also afterwards when they had crossed that sea. Certain spirits said that they wanted to see miracles in order that they might believe; and they were answered in this way: faith is something intrinsic, and it fixes its root in the internal of man; it cares nothing for miracles, it despises them; but with those who have no faith, even miracles can never produce any root. These and similar things are better and more fully apprehended when there is conversation with spirits. They perceive the full sense together with the antecedents and the consequents; the sense is also assisted by a kind of representation and imagination, which is a kind of angelic speech. 1747, Oct. 30, <sup>1</sup>o.s. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The manuscript has Oct. 23, but since in nos. 226, 229, and 331, the date 22 is crossed out and 29 written above, it seems evident that the author omitted to make the change here. For the same reason, in the first line of n. 228 we have changed 22 and 23 to 29 and 30, as the author himself did in the last line. In n. 230 we have twice changed 23 and 24 to 30 and 31. </p>
