<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4107</h4><p>4107. About a state of courtesy<p>There are in the other life those who live in a state of politeness, so called, which is agreeable and pleasant, in which I was for some time. They fear no one, living in their pleasant and agreeable condition. When some not good spirit comes along, they speak civilly with him, as if he were so good as not to say or do anything amiss, thereby bringing that spirit also into a state of courtesy, who then either behaves as a good person, or else departs. For the attitude of one affects the other.<p>Those in that state never say that the other is bad. But it is not a state of pretense, but is rather a sincere one, for they speak courteously, and it is the state of those who had lived in the world happily and well in marriages, and had loved little children. 1748, 1 Dec. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4107</h4><p>4107. CONCERNING A CIVIL STATE.<p>There are those in the other life who live in a so-called civil state, which is pleasant and agreeable, and in which I was for some time. Living in their own agreeable and pleasant sphere, they fear no one, and when any spirit not good approaches, they speak civilly with him as one who is too good to say or do aught that is amiss; such a spirit is then himself also reduced into a civil state, and either demeans himself as good, or departs, for the mind or disposition of the one affects the other. They never in that state say that anyone is bad; though still it is not a state of dissimulation, but of sincerity, for they speak from civil promptings, and it is the state of those who in the world have lived happily and well in the conjugial relation, and have loved children. - 1748, December 1. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4107 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4107. De statu civili<p>Sunt in altera vita, qui in statu sic dicto civili vivunt, qui est amaenus et dulcis, in quo aliquamdiu fui, nullum timent, in suo dulci et amaeno viventes, cum aliquis spiritus non bonus venit, cum eo civiliter loquuntur, sicut ut sit tam bonus ut non hoc dicat, aut faciat, inde redigitur etiam spiritus in statum quoque civilem, et se vel bonum gerit, vel discedit, nam unius animus afficit alterum, nusquam in eo statu, dicunt, quod sit malus; sed non est status simulatorius, sed est usque sincerus, nam per civilia loquuntur, estque eorum, qui in mundo vixerunt feliciter et bene in conjugiis; et infantes amarunt. 1748, 1 Dec. </p>
