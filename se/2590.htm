<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2590</h4><p>2590. By reflection spirits know they are present<p>It has happened on many occasions when someone was being thought about, that the person was presented at hand, and when not thought about, it was as if the person were absent. In fact, when people were thought of, they were at once beside me, right at my head. The most obvious reason to me seemed to be that when they were present, they did not know without reflection that they were present, as commonly happens [to me] in bodily life in groups, even though they are present, still without reflection I do not know what is present. All this also shows what reflection accomplishes in the other life, where they are not visible to each other through the sight of the body. 1748, 13 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2590</h4><p>2590. THAT SPIRITS KNOW FROM REFLECTION THAT THEY ARE PRESENT. <p>It had happened many times when I was thinking concerning anyone that he was displayed [as] present, and when I was not thinking [concerning him] that [he was] as it were absent; and indeed when I was thinking [concerning him], he was immediately near me, yea, at [my] head. I have seen the proximate cause [thereof], that when they were present they have not known without reflection that they were present, as is wont to happen in the life of the body, in societies, although [they] are present, yet without reflection it is not known what is present: from which it may also be manifest what reflection affects in the other life, where they are visible to themselves, in such a manner, by the sight of the body. - 1748, July 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2590 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2590. Quod spiritus ex reflexione sciant quod praesentes<p>Contigerat multoties, cum cogitaretur de aliquo, quod praesens sisteretur, et cum non cogitaretur, quod quasi absens; et quidem cum cogitaretur, quod illico juxta me, imo ad caput; causa proxima mihi visa est, quod cum adessent, absque reflexione non sciverint ii quod adessent, sicut solet fieri in vita corporis, in societatibus, tametsi adsunt, usque absque reflexione non noscitur quod adest, ex quibus quoque constare potest, quid reflexio in altera vita efficiat, ubi non ita per visum corporis sibimet conspicui sunt. 1748, 13 Julius. </p>
