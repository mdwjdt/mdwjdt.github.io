<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第433节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>433.灵人也比世人更有能力通过各种方法去探究并查看某个人是哪种人，或说具有何种品质。这些方法通过各种事物来表现。除了前面所说（400节）的灵人的能力，即灵人掌握人的一切语言，如同自己的母语，并取得他的记忆，如同他们自己的之外，他们还从弥赛亚神那里拥有这样的能力：探究并查看一个人里面属于他生命的最小细节。然而，这一切表现为某些事物从某个人那里被拿走，比如水泡和类似东西，这些东西似乎被拿走了。他们仿佛以这种方式得到指示，立即就说这是什么。有一次，这一切还表现为从一个灵魂那里被拿走的一朵云的形像，而与此同时，这个人仍继续处于另一种状态。他们似乎也从我这里拿走了类似的小水泡，尽管这只是一种象征性的表现，他们由此看到我生命的特殊细节。所以他们从一个小水泡或一个小部分来看待这类事物。此外，他们也深思爱、倾向、情感，以及清晰呈现在眼前的保留在记忆中的事物。对此，我感到非常惊讶，因为他们的眼睛不仅能看见任何人的单个观念，甚至还能看见他最细微的情感。属灵生命是这样：这些事物能被提取出来以进行深入思考，而身体的生命不是这样。（1747年12月30日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 433</h4><p>433. Spirits also have the ability, more than people on earth, by various methods to look into and see what kind of a person someone had been, the methods being pictured in different ways<p>Besides the abilities of spirits spoken of before [<a href="400.htm">400</a>], namely, of possessing every human language as their own mother tongue, and of putting on a person's memory as their own, they also have from God the Messiah, the ability to look into people and see the least details pertaining to their life.<p>Now this was portrayed by some objects being removed from someone, like a bubble, and objects resembling a bubble that also seemed to be taken away; and as if they had been informed in this manner, they at once told what it was. One time this was also done by what looked like a cloud removed from a soul, while in the meantime, the person continues in an altered condition. From me too they removed little bubbles like these (although they are only a symbolic portrayal), and then they saw specific details of my life. So they see such things from one little bubble or part.<p>Moreover, they also look intently at loves, inclinations, and feelings, as well as matters retained in the memory that are clearly displayed to the eye. I was extremely surprised when [I realized] that they had been able to see with their eyes not only someone's single mental images, but even their tiniest feelings. Spiritual life is such that these things can be brought out for scrutiny, unlike the life of the body. 1747, the 30th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 433</h4><p>433. IT IS ALSO GIVEN TO SPIRITS, MORE THAN TO MEN, TO BE ABLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO VIEW INTERIORLY OF WHAT QUALITY A MAN HAS BEEN. THESE WAYS WERE REPRESENTED BY VARIOUS THINGS <p>Besides the things said above, namely, that spirits possess all a man's language as their native tongue and also put on his memory as though it were their own [n. <a href="../se/400.htm">400</a> ]; they can also, when it is granted by God Messiah, view interiorly the single things in a man which concern his life. This, however, has been represented by some things that they have taken from the many, as by a bladder <sup>1</sup>and similar things, which seemed to be taken away. In this way, as though instructed, they have immediately said what it was. Once it was also represented by the likeness of a cloud taken away from a soul, whilst in the meanwhile the man remains in another state. [They seemed] to take away from me also similar little bladders, although it was only a representation by means of like things, and thence they saw the special things of my life; thus they view interiorly such things from one little bladder or part. Moreover, they also contemplate the loves, inclinations, affections, besides the things of the memory represented clearly before the eye, at which I was very greatly surprised, since they could view with their eyes, not only the single ideas of anyone, but also his least affections. The spiritual life is such that these things can be presented for contemplation; not so the life of the body. 1747, Dec. 30. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Index (s.v. Sapientia) it is said to be "a water bubble". </p>
