<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5883</h4><p>5883. About those who were able to convince those who are simple and bring them over to their side simply through a sincere way of speaking<p>It was shown by many things and over a long period of time that just a sincere way of speaking or a sound of sincerity deceived those who are simple and those who are focused on outer things. This was shown over a long time by Lars Benzelstierna, <sup>1</sup>who was able to draw entire groups and parties to his side simply through this sound of sincerity, and by joining with them was able to harm whomever he wished. He said nothing other than "gjor mig til wiljes,Ԫ <sup>1</sup>and gave no reason. From this it is evident how countlessly many there are who give attention only to the way things are said and not at all to the reasons. From this can also be seen how hell can deceive such people.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See footnoted information on him in passage <a href="4851.htm">4851</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5883</h4><p>5883. THOSE WHO, BY SINCERE SPEECH ALONE, ARE ABLE TO WIN OVER THE SIMPLE, AND BRING THEM ON TO THEIR SIDE. <p>It was shown by many things, and for a long time, that sincere speech alone, or that which has the ring of sincerity, could deceive the simple and those who were in externals. This was shown, for a considerable time, in the case of Lars Benzelstierna; who was able to draw to his side entire multitudes and companies, solely by a tone of sincerity, and, through conjunction with them, to inflict injury upon whomsoever he wished. He said nothing else but, "Do me this favor"; <sup>1</sup>nor did he state any reason. It was hence manifest, how innumerable they are who attend only to speech, and not at all to reasons; from which, also, it could be evident in what way hell is able to deceive such ones. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish, gjor mig til wiljes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5883 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5883. De illis qui per solam loquelam sinceram persuadere potuerunt simplicibus, et adducere in sui partes<p>Multis, et per multum temporis ostensum est, quod solum loquela sincera seu sonans ex sincera falleret simplices, et illos qui in externis fuerunt, hoc per multum temporis ostensum est per Lars Benzelstierna, qui potuit integras turmas et cohortes per solum sonum sinceri ad sui partes trahere, et per conjunctionem cum illis malum inferre cuicunque vellet; nihil aliud dixit, quam "gjor mig til wiljes," <sup>1</sup></p><p>nec aliquam rationem dixit, inde patuit, quam innumeri sunt, qui solum ad loquelam attendunt, et nihil ad rationes, unde quoque constare potuit, quomodo infernum tales fallere potest.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;= "gratificeris mihi hoc" (verba suecica) </p>
