<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5724</h4><p>5724. Those who are part of the dragon but who are from the Catholic religion are the beast of the sea and of the land, spoken of in Revelation [13:1, 11]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5724</h4><p>5724. These are of the dragon; but those who are from the Catholic religion are the beast <sup>1</sup>of the sea and of the earth, which are mentioned in the Apocalypse. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See SS 25. <p>5729a. <sup>1</sup>THE MOGUL: ALSO THE LAST JUDGMENT. <p>The Mongols are at the southern side beyond the Christian region. They are haughty, and desire to be distinguished above all others. They are also hostile to Christians. I saw that they were likewise cast down into hells. There were many mountains there, on which they dwell; and they were cast down. The part sank. Those from some of them were cast down into the hells: those on others, to certain places in the desert. They are haughty on account of being rich. There is a diamond mine with them; also, gold with them. All those underwent such judgment who think only about Mohammed and little about God; as all there do who are in the love of self. <p>1.&nbsp;There are no nos. 5725-5729 in the original. -TR. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5724 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5724. Illi sunt draconis, sed qui e Catholica religione sunt bestia maris et terrae, de qua in Apocalypsi [XIII: 1, [11]. </p>
