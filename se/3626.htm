<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3626</h4><p>3626. Some are so far misled by spirits that they cannot return into truths but have let their fantasies take root so deeply that whenever they fall into those thoughts, they are entirely immersed in them, so that they cannot thereafter be dispelled by means of diversions, but remain in the conviction that things are such, or that they are so. Cases of this kind, when they appear before the world, are called obvious insanities, for from that kind of insanity or fantasy they do not allow themselves to be brought back, though they are apparently sane in other respects. Many are insane in this manner. It is a kind of insanity like that of two in Stockholm, one carrying papers, whom the other imagines to be winged. But there are many who do not openly appear insane. All hallucinations regarding spiritual matters originate from this cause, to the degree that the spirits have induced persuasion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3626</h4><p>3626. Some persons are led by spirits to that degree, that they cannot return to what is true, but their phantasies have become so deeply rooted, that as often as they fall into those thoughts, they are so completely absorbed in them that they cannot be dispelled by change of circumstances, but they remain in the persuasion that things are as they imagine, and themselves also. When cases of this kind are obvious to the world, they are called open insanities, for from such insanity or phantasy they do not suffer themselves to be recovered, though apparently sane on all other subjects, as many insane persons are. It is a particular species of insanity, like that of a couple of men at Helm, one of whom carries about written papers, the other supposed himself to be a bird; though there are many of this character who are not generally regarded as such. All phantasies respecting spiritual things derive their origin from this source, and which prevail so far as they have induced persuasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3626 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3626. Quidam eo perducuntur a spiritibus, ut redire nequeant in vera, sed phantasiam in tantum radicaverunt, ut quoties labitur in eas cogitationes, iis prorsus immergatur, sic ut non per varietates discuti dein queant, sed in persuasione sunt, quod res tales, vel ii tales, ejuscemodi cum coram hominibus patent, vocantur insaniae apertae, nam ab insania seu phantasia ista se reduci non patiuntur, in caeteris apparentes sani, sicut plures insani sunt, estque species insaniae, sicut apud binos Holmiae, unum qui chartas portat, alterum qui [eum] putat alitem, sed sunt perplures tales qui non manifeste apparent; omnes phantasiae de spiritualibus, inde quoque trahunt originem, quantum persuasionem induxerunt. </p>
