<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>315.一个人的思维和观念在天堂会变得如此明显可见，在那里的人能清清楚楚地看见它们流入此人，使他说话，并且如此明显，以致人无法想象还有比这更明显的了。有一个灵魂被恶灵包围，如我所判断的，这个灵魂从来没有想到别的，只以为他所思所行的一切皆来自他自己。那时所发生的一件事，向站在他周围的灵魂和灵人清楚表明一个灵魂如何被引导，除了通过他看不见的灵人所流入的东西外，他说不出，也讲不出任何东西，这事是这样：有人只说了一句琐碎的话，如在属灵天堂通常所发生的情形，它就变得可见，并被听见。这句话被传了下去，在灵人们中间滚来滚去，因而来到正在说话的所有人那里。因此，在中间的那个灵魂以为他正从自己说话，他也不知道别的，如他现在所声称的。不久之后，他被恩准以同样的方式照他的思维说话，但说得更快，以至于它能表明这些事在更内层的天堂看得、听得有多么清楚。说话很快，有时稍慢一些，如当一个人正在思考的时候。那时可以注意到，被如此包围的那个灵魂不知道别的，只知道是他在思考和说话。（1747年12月8日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 315</h4><p>315. A person's thoughts and mental images become so plainly visible in the heavens, and those who are there can so plainly see them streaming toward the person and causing him to speak, that one could not imagine anything more obvious<p>There was one soul surrounded by evil spirits who, as far as I can judge, had never believed differently than that each and every thing he thought and did was from himself. Then something happened to show clearly to the souls and spirits standing around him, how such a soul is led, and that he says and speaks nothing whatever but what flows in through the spirits around him, unseen by him: one little word only was spoken, and it became visible as is usual in the spiritual heaven; and it was heard how the word that was let down rolled around among the spirits and thus came to all those who were speaking. So the soul in the middle imagined he was speaking from himself, nor could he tell otherwise, he now declares.<p>Presently it was granted him to speak his thoughts in a similar way, but more quickly, so as to show how plainly they can be seen and heard in still more inward regions. The speaking went quickly, just as when a person is thinking - only a little more slowly. It happened in the same way, but then one could see that this encircled soul could not tell otherwise than that it was he who was thinking and speaking. 1747, the 8th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 315</h4><p>315. THAT MAN'S THOUGHTS AND IDEAS APPEAR SO MANIFEST IN THE HEAVENS, AND [THOSE THERE] CAN SEE THEM INFLOWING INTO THE MAN AND LEADING HIM TO SPEAK, SO MANIFESTLY, THAT THE MAN CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYTHING MORE MANIFEST IS POSSIBLE <p>There was a certain soul with evil spirits around him, who, as I can surmise, never supposed otherwise than that he thought and did each and all things of himself. In order that it might appear clearly before the souls and spirits standing around how such a soul is led, and that he speaks and says nothing whatever except what inflows through the spirits who are around him, and invisible to him, there was dictated a merely trifling expression, and - as usually happens in the spiritual heaven - it appeared and was heard. This word, having been sent down, rolled about among the spirits, and thus came to all who were speaking; and the soul in the midst thus supposed that he spoke from himself, nor could he know otherwise, as he now says. Soon afterwards it was granted him to speak in like manner according to his thoughts, but more quickly, so that it might be shown how the same things can be more manifestly noticed and heard in the still more interior [heavens]. The speech, coming forth in a like manner, was done quickly, and sometimes more slowly, as when a man is thinking; but it could then be noticed that that soul, being so surrounded, could know no otherwise than that it was he who thought and spoke. 1747, Dec. 8. </p>
