<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2297</h4><p>2297. About the Countlessness in everything<p>A spirit was angry because I had said several times that nothing exists in the constitution of the universe that is not a most general thing, containing within itself countless elements - not even the idea of a single word, or even of several ideas of a word. To him this meant he understood nothing, because each thing contained a countlessness, such as for example the word "fear."<p>But I was prompted to reply to him that there was not only a countlessness, but a countlessness of countlessnesses of countlessnesses and still of countlessnesses - thus any natural countlessness whatever multiplied by so many countlessnesses multiplied by themselves. At this point he was occupied somewhat by a spiritual mental image, whereupon he declared that in this case he was nothing, consequently knew nothing. This was corroborated by angels. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2297</h4><p>2297. CONCERNING THE INDEFINITE [indefinitate] OF ALL THINGS. <p>Inasmuch as it has been said several times that there is nothing given in the nature of things which is not a certain very general principle, and contains in itself indefinite things, not even the idea of a single word; still more: one made up of many ideas, a spirit, was indignant that he therefore comprehended nothing because [there prevailed] the indefinite in everything, as [for instance] now, in fear. But it was given to reply to him that not only is there the indefinite, but an indefinite of indefinites, of indefinities and still of indefinities so that every natural indefinite is multiplied by indefinities multiplied so many times together and then at the same time he was somewhat stirred by a spiritual idea to say that then he was nothing, therefore knew nothing, which is confirmed by the angels. - 1748, June 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2297 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2297. De Indefinitate omnium<p>Quia aliquoties dictum, quod nihil detur in rerum natura, quod non est communissimum quoddam, et in se contineat indefinita-ne <sup>1</sup></p><p>quidem idea vocis unius, magis adhuc, quae ex pluribus ideis-indignatus <sup>2</sup></p><p>spiritus, quod sic nihil comprehenderet, quia indefinitum in quacunque re, sicut nunc in timore; sed respondere ei dabatur, quod non solum indefinitum sit, sed indefinitas, indefinitatum, indefinitatum, et adhuc indefinitatum, ita quodcunque indefinitum naturale multiplicatum per toties in se multiplicandas indefinitates; et simul tunc idea spiritualis paulum occupabat eum, ut diceret quod tunc nihil esset, proinde nihil sciret, quod confirmatum est ab angelis. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has indefinita, ne<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ideis, indignatus </p>
