<p>347.在伊斯兰教徒当中，只有小孩子立即进入天堂，但男孩和女孩不行。我心中升起疑问，想知道在伊斯兰教徒当中，好几岁的男孩和女孩是否也被带到弥赛亚神的天堂。我被告知，他们的小孩子被提上去，但10岁左右的男孩和女孩照他们所受的教育、能力和本性被提上去。后者不是立刻被提入天堂，而是转到他们的灵人当中，然后逐渐被完善和提升。我还听说，他们不知道他们以前所认识的人当中的许多人去了哪里。我还发觉男孩和女孩为何不能立刻被提上去，即：他们被牢牢地强行灌输了异教思想。（1747年12月15日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 347</h4><p>347. Only the little children of Mohammedans come immediately into heaven, but not the boys and girls.<p>When a concern arose in my mind about the little children of Mohammedans, whether their boys and girls of a few years old will be taken away to the heaven of God the Messiah, I was told that their little children are raised up, but that boys and girls 10 years of age, more or less - depending upon education, ability, character - are not at once elevated into heaven, but are transferred among their spirits, and then gradually perfected and raised up. What I have also heard said is that they did not know where many of them had gone whom they had known before, and I realized that the reason, [namely] that boys and girls cannot be raised up quickly enough to avoid being firmly indoctrinated in heathenism. 1747, 15 December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 347</h4><p>347. THAT ONLY THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF MAHOMEDANS COME INTO HEAVEN IMMEDIATELY, BUT NOT SO THE BOYS AND GIRLS <p>A misgiving arose with regard to Mahomedan children, whether their boys and girls of a few years old were also carried away into the heaven of God Messiah. I was told, however, that their little children were taken up, but the boys and girls about ten years old, more or less, were taken up according to their education, capacity and nature. The latter are not immediately elevated into heaven, but are transferred to their spirits, and thus are gradually perfected, and raised up. I also heard it said that they did not know whither many of those they had before known have gone. I also perceived that the reason why the boys and girls cannot be taken up so quickly is that they are firmly imbued with paganism. 1747, Dec. 15. </p>
