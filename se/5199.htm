<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5199</h4><p>5199. About spiders<p>I saw many women who appeared like spiders who let themselves down by threads, who were thrown out of heaven. It was their affections that appeared like this. They were those who in their speech, gesture and appearance seemed pious and devout, but inwardly were overflowing with adulteries, thefts, and every kind of malice and deceit. Consequently their inward aspects were full of poison. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5199</h4><p>5199. CONCERNING SPIDERS.<p>I saw many females who were cast down from heaven, and who appeared like spiders letting themselves down by threads. It was their affections which appeared so. They were such persons, as, in speech, gestures and face, seemed pious and devout, but inwardly abounded in adulteries, thefts and all wickedness and deceit: thus, their interiors were full of venom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5199 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5199. De araneis<p>Vidi plures quae apparebant sicut araneae quae se demittunt per fila, quae e coelo dejiciebantur, erant affectiones earum quae sic apparebant, erant illae quae in loquela, gestibus et facie visae sunt piae et devotae, sed quae intus scatebant adulteriis, furtis, et omni malitia, dolo, ita interiora earum erant plena venenis. </p>
