<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2450</h4><p>2450. About greed<p>I spoke with spirits about the possession of money without use, some spirits being such from their life in the body that they want to possess money for the sake of money, not for the sake of any other use than that they delight in money. When I asked them, on account of what use, whether for clothing, houses, or food, they said for the pleasure of the sight of money, silver, and gold, thus not for any use from it.<p>This cupidity is called greed, and it is most foul because it is very gross. For money is for the sake of use, just as anything possessed in the life of the body must be for the sake of use. When use perishes, it is entirely dead, a corpse. So all things to the very least are judged by purpose. It is purpose that forms character, it is purpose according to which they are judged in the other life. Purpose is the all in all of character. The purpose of purposes of all things must be the Lord. 1748, 30 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2450</h4><p>2450. CONCERNING AVARICE. <p>I spoke with spirits concerning the possession of money without use. Certain spirits are of such a character [derived] from the life of the body, that they wish to possess money, for money's sake, not for any other use, than to be delighted with monies. When I have inquired, on account of what use, whether on account of garments, houses, or food, they have said, that [they have desired it] on account of delight at the sight of monies, silver and gold, therefore on account of no use from these. Such a cupidity is called avarice, and is most base, because most gross; for money is for the sake of use, like as whatever is possessed in the life of the body should be for the sake of use. When the use perishes it is wholly dead, and a carcass. Thus it is from the end that each and all things are judged; the end is what forms the disposition; it is the end according to which they are judged in the other life; the end is the all in all of the disposition; the end of all ends should be the Lord. - 1748, June 30, </p>

De avaritia<p>Loquutus sum cum spiritibus, de possessione pecuniae absque usu, quidam spiritus tales sunt ex vita corporis, quod possidere velint pecuniam, propter pecuniam, non propter alium usum, quam ut delectentur pecuniis, cum quaesivi propter quem usum, num propter vestes, domos, aut cibum, dixerunt quod propter oblectationem ex visis pecuniis, argento et auro, sic propter nullum usum ex iis; talis cupiditas vocatur avaritia, estque foedissima, quia crassissima, nam pecunia est usus gratia, sicut quicquid possidetur in vita corporis erit usus gratia, pereunte usu, est prorsus mortuum, et cadaver, sic ex fine omnia et singula judicantur, finis est, qui format indolem, finis est, secundum quem in altera vita judicantur, finis est omne in omnibus <sup>1</sup></p><p>indolis, finis finium omnium erit Dominus. 1748, 30 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has omnis in omnibus; sic etiam in indice ad Avarita, Finis, Indoles, Usus, sed vide 2451 initium </p>
