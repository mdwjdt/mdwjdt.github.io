<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>318.魔鬼扭曲真理与良善的狡诈难以尽述。现在，我通过活生生的经历也获知，魔鬼团伙的狡诈如此之大，以致若有可能，他们甚至能败坏天人或天使灵。因为我被众多诡诈、凶恶的魔鬼团伙包围，他们伙同在天堂与他们勾结在一起的其他人扭曲我那时从弥赛亚神的圣言所思想的一切。事实上，他们能在一瞬间抓住我心里所明白的真理，并极其巧妙地把它们转变为虚假，以致离那个地方有段距离的天人开始受到烦扰，直到他们再也无法忍受，甚至以为他们也有可能被败坏。我能从他们的哭泣和抱怨意识到这一点。所以，被囚在地狱里的魔鬼，其狡诈具有这样的性质：他以为自己甚至能败坏天人；然而，天人是最安全的，尽管他们自己感到害怕。我被这种魔鬼团伙包围，对此，我不仅从天人那里得以听说，还通过清晰的感觉意识到了。因为每当他们聚在一起时，我就感到一阵冷风袭来，又感到侵袭我的寒冷，还模模糊糊地感到他们正在行动，也就是说，正在将真理扭曲为虚假，以及听见他们大声责骂和他们的回答。我同样从那时在我周围的人那里听说这一点，他们说，在此期间，他们一直在地狱，并看到最可怕的事。直到末了，这些灵人才意识到他们一直在我附近。因为地狱并不在某个地方，而是和天堂一样无处不在；事实上，所有天堂和弥赛亚神都是无处不在的。（1747年12月8日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 318</h4><p>318. The cunning of the devil in distorting truths and goodness cannot be adequately expressed<p>Now from actual experience I have also learned that the cunning of the diabolic gang is so great that they could even corrupt the heavenly, if it were possible. For I was surrounded by very many of the devil's deceitful and pernicious gang, which, together with others in heaven collaborating with them, was distorting all thoughts from the Word of God the Messiah at that time. Indeed, they were able in an instant to seize from my mind truths that I understood; and they were turning them so skillfully into falsities, that the heavenly beings who were at some distance from that place began to be upset, until they could bear it no longer, thinking that even they had been able to be corrupted. This I was enabled to realize from their weeping and complaining.<p>So the cunning of the devil, who is held bound in hell, is such that he imagines himself able to corrupt even the heavenly, who, even though they are most safe, are nevertheless fearful.<p>That I was surrounded by such a diabolic gang, I was not only given to hear from the heavenly ones but also [to know] because of a clear sensation that came over me - of cool wind, whenever they were gathering together, and again, of a coldness that touched me; likewise by a vague sensation when they were in action, that is, when they were distorting truths into falsities, as well as by a loud voice scolding them, and from their replies. I heard it also from those who were then around me, who were saying that during this time they had been in hell, and had seen most dreadful things, and toward the end realized that they had been close to me. For hell is not in one place, but everywhere, as is heaven, too - in fact all the heavens, and God the Messiah. 1747, the 8th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 318</h4><p>318. THAT THE CUNNING OF THE DEVIL IN PERVERTING TRUTHS AND GOODS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY EXPRESSED <p>From living experience I have also now learnt that the cunning of the diabolic crew is so great that it would pervert even the heavenly ones <sup>1</sup>if it were possible. For I was encompassed by a great many of the devil's deceitful and pernicious crew who, with others in heaven in communication with them, perverted all the things I thought, which at the time were from the Word of God Messiah, and were indeed truths which my mind apprehended: and they were able in a moment to take them from my mind, and they turned them into falsities so craftily that the heavenly ones, who were some distance away, began to be disturbed to the point that they could bear it no longer, supposing that they also might be perverted. This was given me to perceive from their lamentation and complaint. Such, therefore, is the cunning of the devil who is held bound in hell, that he supposes that he is even capable of perverting the heavenly ones, who, although they are most safe, still fear for themselves. That I was encompassed by such a diabolic crew, not only was I granted to hear from the heavenly ones, but also I was aware of it from manifest sensation. This was effected by a somewhat cold wind as often as they were gathered together, and again by the coldness affecting me, likewise by an obscure sensation that they were operating, that is to say, perverting truths into falsities, and also by their scolding in a loud voice, and from their replies. This was felt in like manner by those who were then around me, who said that in the meanwhile they had been in hell, and had seen most dreadful things. Towards the end, these spirits knew that they had been near me: for hell is not in any one place, but everywhere, as also is heaven, yea the heavens and God Messiah. 1747, Dec. 8. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Index (s.v. Angelus) they are called "Angelic Spirits". </p>
