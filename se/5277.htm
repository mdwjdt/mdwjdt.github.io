<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5277</h4><p>5277. About the eastern quagmire<p>After this I was brought down to an eastern quagmire and I saw that everything there was arranged in orderly fashion. Every evil spirit was given a place of his own, and those who would take care of them were put in charge; and the gang that was not so malicious was taken away and transported elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5277</h4><p>5277. CONCERNING THE EASTERN GULF. <p>Afterwards, I was brought to the eastern gulf, and I saw that all things there were appointed and arranged, that every evil one was allotted his place, and that some were placed over them to have charge; and the crew that was not quite so wicked was removed from there and carried away elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5277 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5277. De voragine orientali<p>Postea deductus sum ad voraginem orientalem, et vidi quod omnia ibi ordinarentur, et disponerentur, darentur cuivis malo sua loca, et praeficerentur qui curam haberent; et turba quae non ita malitiosa, ibi exemta et alibi delata. </p>
