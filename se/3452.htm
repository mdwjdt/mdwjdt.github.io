<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3452</h4><p>3452. When the king's preacher had thus been exposed as a participant, the rest confessed that he had participated, but that they had also engaged in such intercourse without him, and then with <sup>1</sup>less shame.<p>A house was also shown, which was of a yellow color, and the entrance, but the entrance was soon covered over by a cloud. He said that he had his wife there.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The autograph has absque, but we believe the author intended to amend absque, "without," into minore, "with less."-Tr. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3452</h4><p>3452. When this preacher of the king was thus detected as having been concerned [in the abomination], the rest confessed that such was the fact, but that still, independent of him, they had had such intercourse, but that on account of his participation, they had done it with less shame. The house also, which was of a yellow color, was shown, together with the entrance, but the entrance was presently covered by a cloud: he said that he had his wife there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3452 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3452. Cum ita detectus praedicator regis, quod interfuerit, confessi caeteri quod interfuerit, sed quod absque eo etiam habuerint tales congressus, et tunc absque minore pudore: domus etiam ostensa, quae flavi coloris, et introitus, sed introitus nube mox obtectus: quod uxorem suam ibi habuerit, dixit. </p>
