<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2291</h4><p>2291. There is constant preparation for Life from the Lord, but never Life<p>I had a conversation with angels about the question whether they obtain anything of life, or whether all things to the very least that the Lord works in earthly humans, [newly arrived] souls, spirits and angels are nothing but preparations for life. That they can never obtain life as their own, is an established truth. That they are only instruments or substances instrumental to life, or vessels of life, is also a truth. So it is also a truth that they are only being prepared for receiving life, not for possessing it.<p>By a spiritual mental image, the preparation was then pictured by forms of receiving, which depictions cannot come down into a human mental image while one is in the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2291</h4><p>2291. THAT THERE IS CONTINUALLY [continuatio for continuo, I think] [GIVEN] BY THE LORD A PREPARATION [TO RECEIVE] LIFE, AND NEVER LIFE [ITSELF]. <p>I was in discourse with the angels concerning this, whether they receive aught of life, or whether each and all that the Lord operates in men, souls, spirits, and angels are only preparations (for receiving life); that they could never receive life as their own is a truth and confirmed; that they are only organs or organic substances of life, or vessels of life, this also life, not to possess it, this also is a truth. By a spiritual idea the preparation was thus represented, as it were, by kinds [species] of receptions [recipiendi] destitute of life, and that they are only such kinds of receptions these representations cannot fall into human idea while [man] is in the body. </p>

Quod sit continua <sup>1</sup></p><p>praeparatio ad Vitam a Domino, et nusquam Vita<p>Cum angelis eram in sermone de eo, num aliquid vitae accipiant, aut num solum omnia et singula, quae operatur Dominus in hominibus, animabus, spiritibus, et angelis, sint modo praeparationes ad vitam; quod vitam nusquam accipere possint ut suam, est veritas et confirmata, quod solum sint organa seu substantiae organicae vitae <sup>2</sup></p><p>, seu vasa vitae, hoc quoque veritas, sic quod praeparentur modo ad recipiendam vitam, non possidendam, hoc quoque veritas: per ideam spiritualem repraesentabatur sic praeparatio quasi per species <sup>3</sup></p><p>recipiendi, absque vita, et quod tantummodo sint species tales recipiendi, quae repraesentationes non cadere possunt in ideam humanam, dum in corpore est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has continuatio<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has vita<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has spcies </p>
