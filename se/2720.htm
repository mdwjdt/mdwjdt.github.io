<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2720</h4><p>2720. About the variety of happy states in the heavens<p>There are souls who, being raised up into a certain heavenly joy, spoke with me about the heavenly joy. I was prompted to tell them that any soul may experience heavenly joy, even the evil, but one or another state of it, and that there are countless most general states with their variations. So they cannot experience other than very few of the joys of heaven, others none at all. I was also inspired to say that the variations of general states also have their own order, or that there is an order of general states, as well as perpetual changes to eternity, but entirely according to the Lord's good pleasure. 1748, 1 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2720</h4><p>2720. CONCERNING THE VARIETIES OF FELICITIES IN THE HEAVENS. <p>There are souls, who have been raised up into a sort of heavenly joy, that spoke with me concerning heavenly joy, to whom it was granted me to say that every soul, even the evil, can be in heavenly Joy in some state or other; and that there are indefinite states, and their variations of a most general kind [communissimi], so that they cannot be in the joys of heaven save in a very few [states], [and] in others not at all. It was also granted to say, that the variations of general states also have their order, or that there is an order of general states, as also that the changes are perpetual to eternity, but wholly out of the Lord's good pleasure. - 1748, August 1. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2720 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2720. De varietate felicitatum in coelis<p>Sunt animae, quae in gaudium quoddam coeleste, sublati sunt, qui mecum loquuti de gaudio coelesti, quibus dicere mihi dabatur, quod esse possint in gaudio coelesti, omnis anima, etiam mali, sed in uno alterove statu, et quod indefiniti status communissimi sunt, et eorum variationes, ita quod non possint in gaudiis coeli esse, quam in paucissimis, in aliis nequaquam; dicere etiam datum, quod statuum communium variationes quoque suum ordinem habeant, seu quod statuum communium ordo est, tum quoque mutationes perennes in aeternum, sed prorsus ex beneplacito Domini. 1748, 1 Aug. </p>
