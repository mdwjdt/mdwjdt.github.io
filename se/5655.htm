They have books containing the doctrines of their worship and books based on them. One and another of these books was taken out and read before others. The doctrinal teaching there was to the effect that they should ask God the Father to forgive them for devoting themselves to the devil, because He does not want to bring them help, and they know that they receive help from the devil, on which account they devote themselves to him and establish worship, calling him their patron; another book was opened, which was written simply in characters following the style used in the heavenly Kingdom, this being done with round lines and merely curves. When this was unraveled, it was [a statement] that nothing is done by the Divine, but everything by the devil. Their religion was like this inwardly when they had lived in the world, although outwardly it appeared otherwise. They were asked why they do this when they have whatever they need, things like a house, food and clothing, and they can also live among themselves just as in the world. What more do they want, that they devote themselves to the worship of the devil? They said they do this so that they can have control of everyone around them and possess everything </p>

They had books in which the doctrine of their worship was, and books in agreement therewith; and one book and another was taken away from them, and read before others. In it, was a doctrinal of this kind: that they should beseech God the Father that He would excuse them for having recourse to a devil, because He is not willing to assist them, and they know that they obtain aid from the devil; wherefore, they have recourse to him, and set up his worship, calling him their patron. And the other book was opened, which was written in mere characters after the manner which prevails in the celestial kingdom, and this by means of curves and simple inflections; and it was deciphered. It was, that nothing was from the Divine, but everything from the devil such, also, had been their interior religion when they lived in the world, although the exterior appeared different. They were asked why they so behave; since they have whatever is necessary, as houses, food and clothing, and likewise were able to live among each other as in the world what more they want, that they should betake themselves to the worship of a devil. They answered that it is in order that they may rule over all others round about and possess all # <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No. 5656, is placed between nos. 5851 and 5652. -ED. </p>

Quod essent cultores diaboli detectum etiam est, habebant libros, ubi doctrina illorum cultus, et libros secundum illa, et unus et alter liber ab illis exemtus est, et lectus coram aliis, ibi doctrinale erat tale, quod peterent Deum Patrem ut excuset eos, quod se conferant ad diabolum, quia non vult opem ferre, et sciunt quod opem ferant a diabolo, quare ad illum se conferunt, et ei instituunt cultum, vocando illum suum patronum; et alius liber apertus est, qui scriptus meris characteribus secundum modum quo in Regno coelesti, et hoc per volutiones et meras inflexiones, et ille extricatus, erat quod nihil a Divino, sed omne a diabolo, talis quoque eorum religio interior fuerat cum vixerunt in mundo, tametsi exterior apparebat aliud, quaerebantur cur ita faciunt, cum habeant quicquid opus est, ut domos, victus et amictus, et quoque vivere inter se possent, sicut in mundo, quid amplius velint, quod semet conferant ad cultum diaboli, dicebant, quod sit, ut possint dominari supra omnes alios circumcirca, et possidere omnia </p>
