<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1258</h4><p>1258. Someone was brought out to me from there and spoke with me, and from many indications I could certainly tell that he was extremely deceitful, from both his cloaked and his obvious schemes, and also from his energy field, by which a spirit is also recognized, spoken of elsewhere [<a href="152.htm">152</a>, <a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="973.htm">973-982</a>]. However, I was not able to reach any sure conclusion, particularly for the reason that we must not attribute evil to anyone, still less judge them, because no one but the Lord Alone knows a person's inward qualities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1258</h4><p>1258. This spirit was thence brought to me and spoke with me, and I perceived from many things that he was most deceitful, both from his crafty schemes and from those that were open, as well as from the sphere of his activity by which a spirit is also recognized, concerning which see elsewhere [n. <a href="../se/973.htm">973</a>. However, I could not conclude from this anything for certain, especially for the reason that nothing of evil ought to be attributed to anyone, still less ought he to be judged, for no one but the Lord alone knows man's interiors. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1258 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1258. Quidam inde ad me adductus est, et mecum loquutus, et quidem ex multis percepi, quod dolosissimus esset, tam ex subdolis ejus machinationibus, quam ex apertis, tum ex sphaera ejus activitatis, ex qua spiritus quoque cognoscitur, de qua alibi [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1258/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_973" target=_top>973-982</a>]; sed usque non potui inde aliquid certe <sup>1</sup></p><p>concludere; cumprimis quia nulli tribuendum est aliquid mali, minus judicandum; quia interiora hominis nullus nisi Solus Dominus novit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
