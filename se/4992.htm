When she was discovered, she had a room on the right which was fashioned into a spiral, and she entered by the spiral and sat in the middle and from there ruled in all directions, harassing in many ways. She also had another room made in the form of a labyrinth, where she also carried on criminal activity. Forward a little to the left she also had another from which she also directed things in similar fashion. And she did all these things representatively in accord with the inflow of those spirits from Eastern India. </p>

When detected, she had, at the right hand, a room which was formed into a spire, and she entered by a spire, and sat in the middle, and thence ruled on all sides, and harassed her victims in numerous ways. She had also another room, formed into a labyrinthine shape, from whence also she perpetrated wickednesses. She also had another, in front, a little to the left, from whence, also, she directed things in a similar manner; and she did all things in a representative way, according to influx from those evil ones from Eastern India. </p>

Habebat etiam aliud conclave factum in formam labyrintheam, unde etiam scelesta patrabat; habebat quoque antrorsum paulo ad sinistrum aliud, unde etiam similiter dirigebat, et omnia faciebat repraesentative secundum influxum a malis illis ex Orientali India. </p>
