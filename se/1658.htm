<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1658</h4><p>1658. Moreover, they also spoke through my gums, so that the gums together with the teeth received it with an almost painful sensation. There was a clear sensation of tightening of the gums, so that even the teeth, though of course not hurting, still came close to doing so. They said that this kind of speech with their own people does squeeze the teeth in a way that they feel pain from it, and that it was the speech of the kind of spirits who had not yet become angels, thus who had recently come into the other life. Evidently, the sound of speaking streams in by a different route, namely, the Eustachian tube <sup>1</sup>[see <a href="1541.htm">1541</a>].<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the index at Loqui: ". . . the speech entered into the ear through the Eustachian tube." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1658</h4><p>1658. They spoke, moreover, through my gums, so that the gums and teeth perceived it almost with a sense of pain. There was a peculiar constriction, and so manifestly sensible, that although the teeth did not actually ache, yet it came but little short of it. They said, indeed, that this kind of speech among them constringed the teeth in such a way as to cause a sensation of pain, and that it was the speech of spirits who had not yet become angels, consequently of those who had recently come into the other life. The sound of the speech, as was manifestly apparent, flowed in through another way, to wit, through the Eustachian tube. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1658 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1658. Praeterea etiam loquebantur per gingivas meas, sic ut gingivae cum dentibus paene cum sensu alicujus doloris, id perciperent; constringebantur, ad manifestum sensum, ita ut quoque dentes non quidem dolerent, sed usque ut possent dolere, dicebant enim, quod talis loquela apud suos ita constringat dentes, ut dolores inde percipiant; et quod loquela talium spirituum esset, qui nondum angeli facti, proinde qui nuper in alteram vitam veniunt: quod sonus loquelae sic per aliam viam influat, constare potest, nempe per tubam Eustachianam [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1658/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1541" target=_top>1541</a>]. </p>
