<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4041</h4><p>4041. They have nothing from themselves<p>I was leading the spirits overhead to speak, solely by means of thought and its [power of] guiding around - which they supposed to be entirely from themselves. Even though what they were saying was not in keeping with their nature, still they imagined it to be from themselves, such as that we should not do so and so, because it would not go well, and we would be reputed as insane. These words they said from themselves, so that they did not know better until later. Desire and conviction did not appear, but were perhaps breathed in, as usual.</p><p>[2] it was solely thought, that is, a directing of the vessels of the memory alone that caused them to speak as if from themselves. This shows how they make mediums speak by means of thought alone, which the medium follows and utters. This was proven also by others, who even led the deceitful ones to speak. One said that he only thought, then they spoke as he thought, but where his thought came from, he said he did not know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4041</h4><p>4041. THAT NOTHING IS FROM ITSELF.<p>The deceitful spirits over the head, by means solely of their roundabout leading of thought, prompted the spirits that were above me to speak, which they supposed to be wholly from themselves, although it was not congenial to their nature, yet they supposed it to be from themselves; as, for instance, that I should not do so and so, because it did not succeed, and that I should ascribe it to insanity. This they said as from themselves, so that they knew not the contrary till afterwards. Cupidity and persuasion appeared, but this was perhaps breathed in, as it usually is. It was thought alone [that operated], and this is merely a directing of the vessels of the memory, which caused the speaking to be as if from themselves. It thus appeared how it is that they move subjects to speak, viz., by means of thought alone, which the subject follows and utters. This was shown from others who led the deceitful also to speak; one thus prompted said that he simply thought, and as he thought he spoke, but whence came his thought he said he did not know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4041 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4041. Quod nihil ex se Spiritus dolosos supra caput per solam cogitationem et ejus circumductionem ducebam ad loquendum, quod putabant prorsus a semet, tametsi non erat conforme eorum naturae, usque putabant esse ex se, sicut, quod non faceremus ita, quia non succedit, et reputaremur ut insaniae, ea dicebant ex semet, sic ut non aliter scirent quam postea, cupiditas et persuasio non apparebat, sed forte insufflabatur, ut solet; erat sola cogitatio, hoc est sola vasorum memoriae directio, quae faciebat ut loquerentur sicut a se, ita constabat, quomodo agant subjecta ad loquendum, per solam cogitationem, quam sequitur subjectum et eloquitur, ostensum hoc ab aliis, qui ducebant quoque dolosos ad loquendum, dicebat [unus] quod modo cogitaret, sic loquerentur sicut cogitat, sed unde cogitatio sua venit, non nosse se dicebat. </p>
