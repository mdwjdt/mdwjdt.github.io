<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2298</h4><p>2298. Afterwards it was said by those who were with me at the time that if there were no microscopes by which people can look at things too small for the eye to see as it sees larger parts of matter, then because they could not see the interiors of those parts, they would also think of them as a unit, not consisting of countless components. Microscopes have discovered that things formerly thought to have been units contain innumerable parts, as that a little worm scarcely visible to the closest focus of the eye has sense organs, internal organs, just as many as a large animal, that it has a brain, spinal marrows, pulmonary pipes, generative organs, and thus is not a single unit.<p>And what about each of these members? No microscope has yet detected whether or not they consist of follicles, little tubes, vessels, tissues, and in these whether there is not a vital fluid, and so on. This shows how much lies concealed only in bodily and earthly things; but what about in purer things? for any vital element coming from them, comes by means of organic substances. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2298</h4><p>2298. Afterwards it was said by those then with me that if it had not been for the microscope, by which things could be viewed that were too minute for the eye to see, that they would have supposed, for instance, the greater parts of the body, because they could not see their interiors to be a one; still less [would have supposed] it to consist of indefinites. The microscope revealed that those things they previously supposed to have been a unit contain innumerable things; for instance, that a little worm, scarce visible to the minutest ray of sight, possessed organs of sense, viscera, as many as a large animal, cerebrum, spinal marrows, pulmonary pipes, organs of generation; so that there is not a single thing, not any member whatever, but could yet be detected by the microscope as to whether or no it consisted of follicles, pipes, vessels, fibers, and whether or no a vital fluid was therein, and so forth. Thus it must be evident how much is latent only in those things that are merely corporeal and natural. What therefore may not be latent in fewer things; for whatever vital principle arises hence happens by mediate organic substances. - 1748, June 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2298 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2298. Dictum postea, ab iis qui tunc mecum, quod si non microscopia fuissent, per quae intuerentur ea, quae minutiora sunt, quam ut oculus videret, sicut [videt] majores partes corporis, quia non interiora eorum videre possent, quod etiam ea putarent esse unum, minus constare ab indefinitis; microscopia detexerunt, quod ea, quae putarunt prius unum fuisse, quod innumera contineant, sicut vermiculus vix visus radio minimo obvius, quod organa sensus haberet, quod viscera, quot animal magnum, [quod] cerebrum, medullas spinales, pulmonares fistulas, organa generationis-sic <sup>1</sup></p><p>[quod] non unum: quid non unumquodvis membrum, quod nullo microscopio adhuc detectum, annon constaret folliculis, fistulis, vasis, fibris, et in his nonne fluidum vitale, et sic porro? ita constare potest, quantum latet in iis solum, quae mere corporea et naturalia sunt: quid non in purioribus! nam <sup>2</sup></p><p>quicquid inde vitale venit, hoc mediis substantiis organicis accidit. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has generationis, sic<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has purioribus; nam </p>
