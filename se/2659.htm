<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2659</h4><p>2659. About the obsessed<p>Evil spirits long for nothing more eagerly than to completely control an earthly human, both the inward regions and most of all the body. Thereby they seem to themselves to return to the life of the body, for they then absolutely imagine they have returned. But what the difference is when it happens not so evidently as with me, and when it happens with someone else who is not such as I am, I do not yet know.<p>In any case, when they come into a person in such a way that they know for sure they are there and thus control the person's body and members, then this is called obsessing the person. For no spirit is given the ability to control the body as they do with me unless the person had been obsessed - for there are some assigned to that function who do not at all know that they control the body, because only their urge comes into working there, but with the obsessed not only the urge, but also the act [of the obsessing spirit] is present.<p>So there are spirits not assigned to that function who, when they take possession of a body in this way, it is obsession, while with those who are assigned to it, it is not obsession, for then everything is done in an orderly way, and the person does not know this. With the obsessed it is not done in an orderly way, but contrary to order, consequently by evil spirits.<p>But it is amazing that I have been obsessed, and yet it did me no harm whatever. I was able to exercise my rational mind just as if they were not present. 1748, 20 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2659</h4><p>2659. CONCERNING THE OBSESSED. <p>Evil spirits crave nothing more fondly than to wholly rule man, as to his interiors and especially as to his body: they thus seem to themselves to return to the life of the body, for they then suppose they have wholly returned. But what the difference is, when it is not so manifest as in my case, and when [it occurs] with another who is not of such a nature, I do not yet know. Meanwhile when they thus enter a man so as to quite know that they are therein [ibi], and so rule the body and members of man, then this is called obsessing man: for no spirit is granted to rule [a man's] body as they do mine, unless [that man] had been obsessed: for there are those who are devoted to that office, who know nothing concerning their ruling the body, because their endeavors [conatus] only, there come into act: but with the obsessed, not only the endeavor, but also the act is present [to the spirit]. Wherefore there are spirits, who are not devoted to that office, who when they thus obsess the body, it is obsession: but when they are devoted, it is not obsession: for all things thus happen in order, and man is ignorant thereof. When any are obsessed, it occurs not in order but against order; wherefore is produced by evil spirits. But it is wonderful that I have been obsessed, and yet nothing has ever injured me - further I could enjoy my rational mind, just as if they were not present. - 1748, July 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2659 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2659. De obsessis<p>Spiritus mali nihil libentius exoptant, quam ut prorsus regant hominem, tam ejus interiora, quam maxime corpus, sic redire sibi videntur in vitam corporis, nam putant prorsus tunc quod redierint; sed quod discrimen est, cum non ita manifeste, sicut apud me, et cum apud alium, qui non talis, nondum scio; interim, cum ita in hominem veniunt, ut prorsus sciant quod ibi sint, et sic regant hominis corpus, et membra, tunc hoc vocatur obsidere hominem, nam nulli spiritui datur copia regere ita corpus sicut apud me, nisi fuisset obsessus, sunt enim qui muneri isti dicati sunt, qui nihil sciunt de eo, quod regant corpus, quia conatus eorum solum ibi in actum venit, sed apud obsessos, non solum conatus, sed etiam actus adest; quare sunt spiritus, qui non dicati sunt muneri isti, qui dum ita corpus obsident, est obsessio, at cum ii qui dicati sunt, non est obsessio: nam sic ordine fiunt omnia, et homo id nescit; [apud eos] qui obsessi, non ordine fit, sed contra ordinem; quare a malis spiritibus; sed mirabile est, quod obsessus fuerim, et tamen nihil usquam mihi nocuit; tam mente rationali frui potui, sicut si non adessent. 1748, 20 Julius. </p>
