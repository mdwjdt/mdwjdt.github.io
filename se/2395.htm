<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2395</h4><p>2395. What their power of understanding and becoming wise is like can also be inferred from other considerations, for example, that if they only so much as look at or focus their sight upon an evil spirit, then he feels a torment as if he were in the deepest hell. For the force of wisdom is so penetrating that there is nothing in the spirit that does not seem to dissolve. Once an evil spirit who was looked into only slightly by angels began to lament and supplicate as if he were in the throes of death. One spirit appeared to me to be turned into a ball of snakes, because of a single look and the penetrating force of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2395</h4><p>2395. Of what quality is their faculty of understanding and being wise, may also be concluded from other things, as from this that if they only view or penetrate with the sight into an evil spirit, he is then tortured as though he were in the deepest hell; for the force of wisdom so penetrates that there is nothing of the spirits that does not seem to him, as it were, dissolved: so once upon a time a certain evil spirit who was only slightly inspected by angels, began to lament and supplicate, as if in the anguish of death. He appeared to me to be twined into coils of snakes. [This followed] from the glance only [of those angels] and hence the penetrating force thereof. </p>

Qualis facultas intelligendi sapiendique, etiam ex aliis concludi potest, sicut ex eo, si modo intuentur seu visu penetrant in spiritum malum, tunc is ita angitur, sicut in profundissimo inferno esset, nam penetrat ita sapientiae vis, ut nihil apud spiritum non quasi ei videatur dissolvi; ut quondam malus spiritus, qui ab angelis inspectus modo leviter, incepit lamentari et supplicare, quasi in agone <sup>1</sup></p><p>mortis; quidam mihi apparebat in anguium glomerationes verti; ex solo intuitu, et inde penetrante vi.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has angone, quod in J.F.I.
