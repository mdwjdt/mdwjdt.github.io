<p>545.他们的灵人当中还有一类灵人（见541节），这些灵人在责备他们的同时，也教导他们。此类灵人也显得很黑，就像穿着粗麻布，也来到他们的左侧，更朝前。有这种灵人来到我左侧，与我说话。他说，他虽以恐吓吓唬他们，但没有祸害他们。但当人们害怕时，他就会教导他们当如何思考和生活。所以这类灵人是教导他们的。<p>545 1/2.此外，我还看到一个死人的头，或秃头。头顶光秃，骨瘦如柴。据说，凡在一年之内就要死去的，都会看见这种死人的头，以便他们能为死亡做好准备。当然，他们并不害怕死亡，只是怕撇下他们的朋友、父母和孩子；不过，他们知道自己要上天堂，所以并不为此感到悲伤。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 545</h4><p>545. The second kind [see <a href="541.htm">541</a>] of these spirits who reprove, and at the same time teach them, also appear dark, as if they were dressed in sackcloth. These also come up to their left side, more to the front; and such a one came up to my side and spoke with me, saying that while he does frighten them with threats, he nevertheless brings no evil upon them. But when the people are afraid, he teaches them how they should think, and live. So these are their instructors.<p>545. 1/2. Moreover, I was also shown a dead head, or a skull. The highest part of the head was bald, bony. It was said that those see such a head who will die within a year, so that they may prepare themselves for death. They do not, of course, fear death, except because of leaving behind their friends, parents and children; but knowing that they are going away to heaven, they are not saddened by it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 545</h4><p>545. There is another kind of their spirits who rebuke and at the same time teach them. They also appear dark as if clothed in sack-cloth; they, too, apply themselves to their left side, more to the front. Such a one also applied himself to my left side, and spoke with me. He said that he does indeed terrify a man with threats, nevertheless he does not bring evil upon him; but when the man is in a state of fear he instructs him how he ought to think and live. Thus such spirits are their instructors. <p>545 1/2. Moreover, there was also shown me a dead head, or a bald scalp so that the top part of the head was bald and bony; and it was said that those who were to die within a year see such a dead head, so that they may prepare themselves for death. They do not indeed fear death, except on account of their friends, parents and children whom they leave behind; but they know that they are going to heaven, hence they are not made sad on that account. </p>
