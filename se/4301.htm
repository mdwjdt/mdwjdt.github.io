<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4301</h4><p>4301. Other spirits also imagine that they are people on earth, as they have done with me on many occasions, but with a great deal of difference. This is inspired into them, so that they may be of service to mankind, but when they are allowed to reflect on the matter, they know that they are spirits, as has been proved in very many instances, when they have spoken with me about it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4301</h4><p>4301. Other spirits also suppose themselves to be men, as was often proved by my experience, but with great difference. It is impressed upon these that they are to be subservient to man, but when reflection is granted them they know that they are spirits, which was in many ways evinced and conversed about with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4301 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4301. Alii spiritus quoque putant se esse homines, ut apud me multoties, sed cum multa differentia, hoc iis inditur, ut inserviant homini, sed cum datur iis reflexio, sciunt quod sint spiritus, quod permultis ostensum; et loquuti sunt mecum de eo. </p>
