<p>553.关于木星居民续。后来，一个恶灵站在我旁边（参看541节），他们的天使以前面所描述的方式（542节）占据我的头，使灵人远离，防止他给我带来任何祸事。天使唱诗班一个接一个地从我们的天使天堂而来，表演了悦耳、有代表性的涡旋，令这些天使如此快乐，以致他们以为自己被带到更高的天堂，他们想把这一切告诉他们的其他天使。我隐约感受到他们的快乐。此外，一个接一个的唱诗班来了，因而如他们所看到的那样，形成了一种令他们深感快乐的整个天堂。这天堂使他们感到深深的快乐，以致他们坦承，他们的独一主掌管星空中的一切。那些悦耳动听的天使唱诗班持续了大约一个小时，在场的木星灵既感到惊奇，又被深深打动。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 553</h4><p>553. Continuation about the inhabitants of Jupiter<p>After the evil spirit had come up to me [<a href="541.htm">541</a>] and their angels were keeping hold of my head in the way described [<a href="542.htm">542</a>], restraining the spirit from bringing on anything evil, angelic choirs came from our angelic heaven. One after another, they performed their harmonious pictorial gyres, and delighted [their angels] so much that they decided they had been swept up into a higher heaven - I could faintly feel their delights - and they wanted to tell this to their other angels.<p>Moreover, one choir after another kept coming, and thus, as it appeared to them, the entire heaven. This delighted them most deeply, so that they confessed that their One Only Lord governs all in the starry universe. Those melodious angelic choirs continued for around an hour, and [the spirits of Jupiter] were present, and they were amazed, and were deeply moved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 553</h4><p>553. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF JUPITER <p>Afterwards an evil spirit stood near me [see n. <a href="../se/542.htm">542</a> ], and their angels so occupied my head and kept the spirit off that he did not bring any evil upon me. Angelic choirs, one after another, came from our interior heaven, and performed their tuneful, representative gyres, and delighted these angels so much, that they supposed that they had been snatched up into a higher heaven, and they wanted to tell this to their other angels. I felt their delight obscurely. Moreover, there came one choir after another, and thus, as it appeared to them, [formed] a kind of entire heaven which delighted them inmostly, so that they confessed that their One Only Lord governs all in the starry universe. Those tuneful angelic choirs continued about an hour, and those who were present, both wondered and were very greatly affected. </p>
