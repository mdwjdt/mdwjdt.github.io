<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5682</h4><p>5682. That things like angels in human form, dwellings, churches and many other things have appeared to the prophets, these are believed; but if attention is centered on these things, they are thought to be visions, in which there is nothing real.<p>But those of a simple nature do not center in this way and investigate whether it is so, on which account those of them who are not entirely bodily-minded and worldly believe, the learned less so, and the more learned they are the less they believe.<p>But that these things nevertheless really are like this has been granted me to know from many years actual association [with spirits]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5682</h4><p>5682. They believe that such things appeared to the prophets as, for example, angels in the human form, dwellings, temples and many other things; but, if they are placed immediately under their observation, the thought comes up that they are visions in which is no reality. <p>But the simple do not place a material thing under the midst in this way, and investigate whether it is so. Wherefore, those of them who are not altogether corporeal and worldly, believe: the learned to a less extent, and the more learned they are, the less do they believe such things. <p>But, still, it has been granted me to know from the living interaction of many years that those things are really so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5682 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5682. Quod talia apparuerunt prophetis, ut angeli in forma humana, habitacula, templa et plura, haec creduntur, sed si sub intuitione media ponuntur, cogitatur quod sint visiones, in quibus non reale.<p>Sed simplices non ita ponunt res sub medio, et disquirunt num ita sit, quare qui eorum non prorsus corporei et mundani, credunt, minus eruditi, et quo eruditiores eo minus.<p>Sed quod usque illa realiter talia sint, ex plurium annorum viva conversatione scire datum. </p>
