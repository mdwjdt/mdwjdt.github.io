<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5077</h4><p>5077. Continuation about the last judgment<p>It was noted that sometimes the worst spirits gather on the rocks and on the mountains, and I wondered why this happened, when yet such spirits ought to be hidden below in the hells. But the reason is that in the world they have observed the holy things of the Church. They have attended church regularly and gone to the holy supper and have many times heard about heaven and about eternal salvation and also that they themselves are saved by faith alone, not knowing that there is an oral profession of faith and a faith of the heart, or that the knowledge of doctrinal matters is different from faith, nor have they known what conviction is and where it comes from. From this they also have gotten the idea that they could actually enter heaven. Those who have this idea are allowed onto the rocks and the mountains because they believe that heaven is there because it is high up and because heaven too is on mountains and rocks. It is on this account that so many of the worst gather and live there, to the point that when the city then becomes full of such spirits, there is then a visitation, and then such a city falls into hell, which is where they actually dwell. Thus they come to their own dwelling places. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5077</h4><p>5077. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT.<p>It was observed, that, sometimes, the worst spirits assemble themselves upon the rocks and upon the mountains; and I wondered why this happened so, when yet such ones ought to be hidden below, in hell. But the reason is, that, in the world, they have conformed to the holy things of the Church, frequented churches and the Holy Supper, and have heard, as often as they have attended, about heaven and eternal salvation, and, also that they should be saved by faith alone; not knowing what faith of the mouth and faith of the heart is, nor that a knowledge of doctrinals is a different thing to faith, nor what and whence persuasion is. Hence, likewise, they have caught up the opinion, that they could also come into heaven. They who are in this idea are admitted to the rocks and mountains; for they believe that heaven is there, because that is on high, and because heaven also is upon mountains and rocks. Therefore do so many of the worst ones repair thither, and dwell there, until the city becomes full of such, when visitation takes place; and, then, such a city sinks down into hell, where they actually dwell: thus [they reach] their own abodes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5077 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5077. Continuatio de ultimo judicio<p>Observatum est, quod super petras et super montes se quandoque conferant pessimi, et miratus sum cur ita factum, cum tamen tales infra in inferno debeant recondi, sed causa est, quia in mundo sancta Ecclesiae obiverunt, templa frequentarunt, et sanctam coenam, et audiverunt toties de coelo et de salute aeterna, et quoque quod ipsi salvarentur per solam fidem, non scientes quid fides oris, ac fides cordis, nec quid differt scientia doctrinalium a fide, et quid persuasio et unde haec, inde quoque captarunt opinionem, quod etiam illi in coelum venire possent; qui in hac idea sunt, admittuntur in petras et in montes, nam credunt quod ibi sit coelum, quia in alto, et quia coelum quoque est super montibus et petris, ideo illuc se conferunt tam multi inter pessimos, et habitant ibi, usque dum urbs plena talibus fiat, cum visitatio, et tunc talis urbs decidit in infernum, ubi actualiter habitant, ita ad sua domicilia. </p>
