<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5920</h4><p>5920. About Melancthon and persuasion, and Calvin<p>The origin of the Leek<p>I spoke with Melancthon and a little with Calvin, but the latter withdrew because he was not like Melancthon, for Calvin had led a Christian life. But Melancthon had confirmed himself in faith alone, and scarcely wanted to hear about charity and its goodness, consequently his thought was full of things like this and on the basis of these, he justified his persuasion [regarding faith alone]. His persuasion was certainly not strong, yet still it was such that it extinguished the light of understanding in others, with the result that then they could not see truths in any light, as earlier.</p><p>[2] And because the outward appearance of his persuasion was such that it looked snow-white, therefore, when he was unable to convince others about faith alone using rational arguments, he then looked into their eyes and poured in his persuasion, and as a result they were unable to bring up anything against him. Nevertheless, they told him this is a trick to prevent them from grasping things as they did earlier. So he left them, knowing quite well that that he had used such a ploy. On account of this, certain ones complained about him saying, Ԉe poured this sort of persuasive belief into us too, and likewise tried to draw shade over the light of truth, but because this </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5920</h4><p>5920. MELANCTHON AND THE PERSUASIVE [FACULTY]; ALSO CALVIN. THE ORIGIN OF THE LEEK. <p>I conversed with Melancthon, and a little with Calvin but the latter withdrew, because he was not such [as Melancthon] for he led a Christian life; but Melancthon confirmed himself in faith alone, and was scarcely willing to hear of charity and the good thereof - wherefore, his thought was full of things of such a kind, and hence he acquired a Persuasive, which, indeed, was not strong, but still such that it extinguished intellectual life in others, so that they were not then able to see truths in any light, as previously; and, as his species of persuasion, which appeared snow-white, was of such a nature, therefore, when he was not able to convince people concerning faith alone by arguments, he fixed his eyes upon them, and directed his Persuasive into their eyes, and thus they were unable to bring forth anything in opposition to him. They told him, however, that this is an artifice, in order that they may not perceive what they did before. He, therefore, went away from them, knowing well that he employed such artifice. Wherefore some complained of him. He also directed such Persuasive into us, and in a similar way endeavored to overshadow the light of truth; </p>

De Melanctone et persuasivo, et Calvino<p>Porrum unde<p>Loquutus sum cum Melanchtone, et parum cum Calvino, sed hic recessit, quia non fuit talis, vitam enim Christianam egit, sed Melancton confirmavit se in sola fide, et vix voluit audire de charitate et bono ejus, quapropter cogitatio ejus plena fuit talibus, et inde comparavit sibi persuasivum, quod quidem non forte, sed usque tale ut exstingueret lucem intellectualem apud alios, ut tunc non videre possent vera in aliqua luce, ut prius, et quia ejus persuasionis species, quae apparebat nivea, talis erat, ideo cum non potuit aliquos per ratiocinia evincere de sola fide, tunc inspexit in illos, et effudit persuasivum suum in oculos illorum, et sic non potuerunt depromere aliquid contra illum, dixerunt usque ad illum, quod hoc artificiale sit, ut non percipiant quae prius, quare discessit ab illis, sciens probe quod tali arte usus sit; quare quidam conquesti sunt de illo; tale persuasivum effudit etiam in nos, et similiter inducere umbram luci veri tentavit, sed quia hoc </p>
