<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1172</h4><p>1172.<p>I also saw a portrayal of his quality, namely that he lived in a long, arcade-like room, but of a light green color. Then I saw that clouds were hovering in it, which were somewhat white, but which drew their pale tinge from the green. This color they especially enjoy, but not sky blue.<p>In short, since he was versatile and flexible, he could be in the company of good spirits, with the hope that he could be bent toward good. </p>

I also saw a representation of his quality, namely, that he dwelt in a long and, as it were, arched chamber, but of a green color. Clouds also flitted about which were to some extent white, but still they derived their paleness from green with which color they are very greatly delighted, but not with blue. In a word, because he was versatile and pliable he could therefore be in the company of good spirits, in the hope that he could be turned towards good. </p>
