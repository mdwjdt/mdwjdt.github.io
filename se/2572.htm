<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2572</h4><p>2572. <sup>1</sup>Besides those inclinations spoken of above ([<a href="2566.htm">2566-2567</a>]) they also have numerous varieties resulting from them, namely, that they desire to destroy the human race and its life, thus that they are cruel. In their passions they are just like Neros, wanting to take all from their neighbors, laughing at their poverty and misery even if they were dying before their eyes, in fact deriving enjoyments from that, because they are against all compassion, just as the deceitful are against all innocence. Moreover they also very much delight in being able to destroy friendships, and especially marriage loves, engineering enmity between the partners and enticing the wives of others to adulteries, and things of that nature that necessarily result from those two sources, the love of self and the love of the world. 1748, 9 July.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Paragraphs <a href="2572.htm">2572</a>, <a href="2573.htm">2573</a>, and <a href="2574.htm">2574</a> are each marginally emphasized by the word obs.

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2572</h4><p>2572. Besides those inclinations, of which [I have treated] above, they also have such as with manifold variety follow therefrom; to wit, that they desire to destroy the human race as to their life, so that they are entirely as cruel as Neros in their minds; that they desire to take away everything from the neighbor, deriding their poverty and misery, yea, even should they die before their eyes, they hence derive delight; because they are opposed to all mercy, like as the deceitful are opposed to all innocence. Besides, they also [hence] delight much in being able to destroy friendships, and especially conjugial loves, by devising enmities between husband and wife [conjuges], and by alluring [enticing] the wives of others to adulteries, and the like, which necessarily flow from these two fountains, self-love and love of the world. - 1748, July 9. [Marg. Note: "obs."] </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2572 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2572. Praeter eas inclinationes de quibus supra [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2572/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2566" target=_top>2566-2567</a>], etiam eas habent, cum multiplici varietate, quae ex iis consequuntur, nempe quod destruere cupiant genus humanum, quoad vitam eorum, ita quod crudeles sint, prorsus ut Nerones animis suis, quod omnia auferre cupiant proximo, ridentes ad eorum paupertatem et miseriam, si vel ante oculos eorum [mn obs:]morerentur, imo inde oblectamenta capiunt, quia contra omnem misericordiam; sicut dolosi sunt contra omnem innocentiam: praeterea etiam inde multum delectantur, ut destruere possint amicitias, et cumprimis amores conjugiales, inimicitias machinando inter conjuges, et uxores aliorum ad adulteria allectando <sup>1</sup></p><p>{a}, et similia, quae ex binis istis fontibus, amore sui et amore mundi necessario consequuntur. 1748, 9 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
