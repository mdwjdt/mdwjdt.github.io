<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3708</h4><p>3708. In the other life they are not restored to any different life than the kind they had acquired by their actions<p>Spirits were surprised that in the other life they learn and practice new arts, assuming that by [carrying evil] into act they contract a worse life, thus adding evils to evil. But I realized, and told them, that they are not restored into a different life than the one they had acquired by their actions. When they are engaged in that life, whether they practice new arts or former ones, it makes no difference, for no matter what evil they commit, new or old, they are not thereby acquiring a worse life, but only leading the life they had acquired by their actions. For the Lord guards against their going beyond it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3708</h4><p>3708. THAT IN THE OTHER LIFE [SPIRITS] ARE NOT REMITTED INTO ANY DIFFERENT LIFE FROM THAT WHICH THEY HAVE BY ACTUALITY ACQUIRED TO THEMSELVES.<p>[Certain spirits] were moved with wonder that in the other life they should learn and exercise new arts [of wickedness] supposing thence that by actuality they contracted a worse life, so as to add evils to evil. But it was perceived and said, that they were not remitted into any other life than that which they had by actuality acquired to themselves; while the are in that life, whether they exercise new arts or former ones, it is the same thing, for it amounts to the same whatever evil they do, whether new or old; thus it is not acquiring a worse life, but exercising a life acquired by actuality; for it is provided by the Lord that they should not go beyond [their already acquired life]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3708 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3708. Quod in altera vita, non in aliam vitam remittantur, quam in eam, quam sibi actualitate acquisiverant<p>Mirati, quod in altera vita novas artes addiscant, et exerceant, inde putantes quod actualitate contrahant vitam pejorem, sic ut adjiciant mala, malo; sed perceptum et dictum, quod non in aliam vitam remittantur, quam in eam, quam sibi actualitate acquisiverant, cum in ea vita sunt, sive exercent novas artes sive priores perinde est, nam perinde est, quid malum faciant, novum seu vetus, sic non acquirendo vitam pejorem, sed exercendo vitam, actualitate acquisitam, nam a Domino cavetur, ne ulterius eant. </p>
