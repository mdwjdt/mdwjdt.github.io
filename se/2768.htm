<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2768</h4><p>2768. <sup>1</sup>But it is different with the human being. If the father and mother know their children are their own, or if they think they are even if they are not, still they love them as their own, so there is no aura of love conjoining them except their thinking they are their own-no other than the aura of love of self and the world. Neither do the children recognize the parents unless they have been so instructed, differently from brute animals-a clear sign that the life of the human being is against the order of nature; besides countless other confirmations. This good spirits also acknowledged to be true.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;2767 is lacking in the original. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2768</h4><p>2768. But it is different with man. Mothers and fathers, if they know that they are their children or think they are, although they are not, still love them as their own, so that no sphere of love except what they suppose to pertain to themselves, conjoins them, but the sphere of self-love and love of the world. Nor do children acknowledge [recognize] [their] parents, unless instructed: different from brute animals. Which is a manifest proof that the life of man is contrary to nature. Innumerable other [facts] besides [confirm this]. Thus the good spirits also acknowledged, that it is true. </p>
