<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1696</h4><p>1696. There is a punishment, which I saw - and I was grieved at seeing it (I did not know who it was). In front of the spirits he has distressed and offended, he is stretched out horizontally and rolled like a scroll from the left to the right, quite rapidly, then across in a different position, and so on, in almost every position, so that he is seen by all. Sometimes he is half-naked, dressed in clothes with which he tries to cover himself up, because he had been of that character in life. Thus he is turned in a horizontal position toward many quarters, being rolled around with the spirits looking on, and in this manner he is made to feel shame - evident from the fact that he does not want to be stripped of clothing.<p>He is likewise rolled around in another way, namely, head over heels, thus in a manner as when the axis is revolved not along the axis but crosswise to the axis. Then again, he is also rolled horizontally both to the right side and to the left, and then - and this is painful-to the right, like an axle being restrained. For two forces are in action, one turning around, the other going counter to it, being thus held back from the direction it is turning. This causes a pulling apart, and thus pain, due to the action of two forces while turning in one direction. The punishment develops from his defect and its fantasy and is a result of it, thus it comes from the defect and images it, which is amazing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1696</h4><p>1696. (There is a punishment [appointed for such] which I saw, and grieved at beholding it. A certain offender, I know not who he was, was thrown down into a horizontal posture, in the presence of the spirits whom he had thus wounded and scandalized, and was made to revolve with a quick motion like a roller, from left to right, and then transversely in another position, and so on in almost every posture, and so as to be apparent to all. Sometimes he was clothed with garments with which he would fain conceal himself because such had been his character in his lifetime, and again he was half naked. In this manner he was turned horizontally towards several quarters and made to revolve in full view of spirits, till a degree of shame was inspired into him, which appeared from the circumstance of his not wishing to be divested of his clothes. Again he was made to rotate in a different manner, to wit, from the head to the feet as if round an axis, being violently whirled round not with his length parallel to the axis, but transversely or perpendicularly to it. He was then subjected again to a horizontal motion back and forth from left to right, and right to left; then again with extreme pain towards the right, like a hinge, with resistance, for two forces are then acting, one roundwise and the other backwards, so that he was violently forced towards the part to which he was made to revolve; and as he was thus acted upon by two forces, and yet driven in one direction, the result was a kind of rending asunder accompanied with excruciating pain. The punishment thus evolved itself from the offence, and thence also the phantasy, which flows as a consequence from the crime, thus being an image of it, which is wonderful. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1696 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1696. Poena est, quam vidi, et indolui quod viderem-nescivi <sup>1</sup></p><p>quisnam esset-quod <sup>2</sup></p><p>nempe coram spiritibus, quos laeserat, et quibus candalum dedit, sternatur horizontaliter, et circumvolvatur sicut volumen a sinistro in dextrum, et hoc satis festine, tum transversim alio situ, et sic porro fere in omni situ, ut appareat cunctis; quandoque vestibus indutus est-quibus <sup>3</sup></p><p>se obtegere vult, quia in vita talis fuit-seminudus <sup>4</sup></p><p>; ita vertitur horizontaliter, ad plures plagas, et volvitur circum, spectantibus spiritibus, pudor sic ei incutitur <sup>5</sup></p><p>, quod patet inde, quia vestibus nudari non vult; similiter etiam alio modo circumvolvitur, nempe a capite et pedibus, ita in modum axeos {a}, dum projicitur circum, non secundum axem, sed transversaliter ad axem; porro quoque horizontaliter tam ad dextrum quam ad sinistrum; tum, quod fit cum dolore, in dextrum, instar axeos, cum renisu, nam binae vires agunt, una circum, et altera retro, sic ut coacte in partem in quam volvitur, quod quia a duabus viribus, usque in unam partem, fit cum distractione, ita cum dolore. Poena sic se evolvit, ex vitio, et inde phantasia, est consequens ejus, ita consequitur ex vitio, ut sit imago ejus, quod mirum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has viderem, nescivi<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has esset, quod<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has est, quibus<p>4.&nbsp;The Manuscript has fuit, partim seminudus<p>5.&nbsp;The Manuscript has incutititur </p>
