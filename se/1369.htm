<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1369</h4><p>1369. Unclean and evil spirits were very angered, and are angry, when I did not want to acknowledge them as the Holy Spirit - even to the point, in fact, that they threatened to punish me. In the beginning they were so threatening, that before I knew it, they had greatly frightened me. But later I was instructed - and say this boldly before all of heaven, in the hearing of the angels-that those who are truly angels, and sanctified spirits, testify that they never want to be called the Holy Spirit, because Holiness is of the Lord Alone. 1748, 14 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1369</h4><p>1369. Unclean and evil spirits were and are very indignant when I was unwilling to acknowledge them as the Holy Spirit, so much so that they threatened to punish me. At first they so threatened me, that before I knew it I was terrified, but after having been instructed, I say this boldly before the whole heaven in the hearing of the angels. Those who are truly angels and sanctified spirits testify to the fact that they never want to be called the Holy Spirit, for holiness is of the Lord alone. 1748, Mar. 14. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1369 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1369. Spiritus immundi et mali valde indignati sunt, et indignantur, quando eos non ut spiritum sanctum agnoscere voluerim, imo eo usque, ut minati sint me punire, initio ita minati, ut antequam scirem, me valde terrefecerint, sed postea instructus, audacter hoc coram toto coelo, audientibus angelis, dico, et qui vere angeli sunt, et spiritus sanctificati, ii id contestantur, quod nusquam velint Spiritus Sanctus dici, quia Sanctitas est Solius Domini. 1748, 14 Martius. </p>
