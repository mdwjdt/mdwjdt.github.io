<p>305.像天上众星那样的核心和根基在每个天堂都为数众多。每个天堂都有许多核心和根基，直接的交流通过它们存在于众天堂与弥赛亚神之间。它们处于一种极为平静的状态，只能拿人体内的神经中枢和大脑节点来相比，无数纤维流入其中，在那里可以说重新形成；因此，它们周围的事物照着存在于初始物质中的目的而被归入秩序。故一切事物都唯独被弥赛亚神以最完美的秩序和最完美的形式排列。（1747年12月5日）</p>

Centers and bases, which are like stars of the heavens, are very numerous in each heaven.<p>There are many centers and bases in each heaven, and by means of them, direct communications exist between the heavens, and with God the Messiah. They are in a very calm state, and cannot be compared to anything more aptly than to the ganglia in the human body and to the nodes in the brain, into which countless tissues run, and where they are as it were renewed, and thus the things around them are put into order to accord with the purposes present in the first substances. <sup>1</sup>Therefore everything is arranged in a most perfect order and a most perfect form by God the Messiah Alone. 1747, the 5th day of December.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"fines in principiis," perhaps comparable to seeds which are beginning substances containing every future stage in potency. </p>

IN EACH HEAVEN THERE ARE VERY MANY CENTERS AND BASES WHICH ARE LIKE THE STARS OF THE HEAVENS <p>There are many centers and bases in each heaven, by means of which there are immediate communications between the heavens, and with God Messiah. They are in a most tranquil state: nor can they be more aptly likened than to the ganglia in the human body, and to the nodes in the brain, into which innumerable fibers inflow and where they are formed as it were anew; and thus the things that are round about are disposed in accordance with the ends in the beginnings, and all of them therefore in a most perfect order and form by God Messiah alone. 1747, Dec. 5. </p>
