<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3912</h4><p>3912. Throughout the night they hung on there, some imagining, and they themselves, that they were so tightly fastened that they could never be detached. I realized that they were the kind through whom others were operating who had been lewd men, lewd women, having no other purpose than to delight in their lasciviousness - thus not like whores, whose end is profit, but those who were streaming in through the women, had in view only the practice of lewdness. I was told later that those spirits who were clinging to the bones of the skull were the mediums of those lechers, and that they could only serve as mediums having little life, thus but little understanding.</p><p>[2] And it was said that they were people from before the flood who, having been purged, were able to serve as mediums, not retaining any life of their own except only as much life as the bony parts in the human body - in this case, in the head. For those who are of the antediluvians are purged, and become as skeletons, as mentioned above [<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>], or lifeless appendages, and after that a life is breathed into them such </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3912</h4><p>3912. They still adhered there during the whole night, some supposing, and they also, that they were so infixed that they could never be detached. I perceived that they were such that others operated through them, -the lascivious of both sexes, particularly females who were prompted by no other impulse than that of the delight of lewdness, not [however] as harlots prostituting themselves for gain as an end, but [on the contrary] those who flowed through them had lasciviousness only for an end. It was afterwards said that those spirits who thus inhered in the bones of the cranium, were the subjects of these lechers, and that they could only serve them as subjects, having little of life, and thus but little of understanding; and that they were antediluvians, who, being vastated, could serve as subjects, retaining no more of their own life than there is of life in the osseous parts of the human body. These were in the head; for those who were of the antediluvians are vastated and become as skeletons, as before remarked, or as lifeless appendages, and life is afterwards breathed into them, as they are scarcely self-conscious or in an degree sensible, and thus they serve as bones, into whom other spirits can flow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3912 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3912. Per totam noctem ibi adhaeserunt, putantes aliqui et ii, quod ita infixi, ut nusquam separari possent; percepi quod tales essent, per quos alii operabantur, qui lascivi, lascivae fuerunt, ex nullo alio fine quam ut delectarent earum lascivia, sic non ut scorta, quae lucrum pro fine habent, ii autem qui influebant per eas, solam lasciviam pro fine; dictum postea, quod spiritus isti qui in ossibus cranii ita inhaerebant, essent subjecta talium qui lascivi ita, et quod solum pro subjectis inservire possent, parum vitae habentes, ita nec intellecti qualis; et quod essent antediluviani, qui vastati pro subjectis inservire possent, nec aliquid vitae suae retinentes, nisi solum tantum vitae, quantum ossea in corpore humano; hi in capite; nam qui ex antediluvianis vastantur, et fiunt ut sceleta, ut prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3912/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3900" target=_top>3900</a>], seu pendula exanimata postea iis vita inspiratur, </p>
