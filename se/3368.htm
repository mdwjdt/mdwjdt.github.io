<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3368</h4><p>3368. Moreover, there was a spirit toward the right who thought all these things were real-that the Lord had been tormented by them in this way, that they had carried off all my acquaintances, and many more things of which he was persuaded. Yet he was not evil, because the tone of despair in his voice had been caused by a gust of their dreadful persuasion, from afar. All these things occurred in a wakeful state. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3368</h4><p>3368. Moreover there was a spirit at the right, who supposed all these things were real [vera], that the Lord was thus tormented by them, that all my acquaintances were carried away by them, and very many things [besides]; such was his persuasion. But yet he was not evil, inasmuch as such sound of despair, and such speech arose from a certain [sort of] afflatus of their dreadful persuasion, afar off. All these things occurred in wakefulness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3368 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3368. Praeterea spiritus erat, ad dextrum, qui putabat omnia vera: quod Dominus ita ab iis cruciatus, quod omnes mei noti ab iis ablati, et perplura, erat in persuasione; sed usque non malus, quia talis desperationis sonus et loquela erat, orta ex afflatu quodam e longinquo eorum persuasionis dirae. Haec omnia in vigilia. </p>
