For I realized that he could thus be in companies of angelic spirits, while otherwise he would not have been able to.<p>But this is only the first plane into which they are thus inaugurated, for there still remain thoughts and desires as before, but in the absence of this plane, by means of which bodily qualities are most closely adapted to inward ones, he is not allowed by the Lord to be among the angelic in regard to thoughts and feelings. That he could now even be released from lower spirits as to the whole body, was also shown to me by windings and at the same time foldings of his small body - also like a human one in color, which was found to be so flexible that it then could not be hurt by lower spirits, thus by evil ones, because, as I perceived, they could not flow in through fantasies and bring on any pain to his body as they are used to doing to those who have not yet been prepared to be released from such spirits. </p>

But this is only the first plane wherein they are thus inaugurated; for thoughts and cupidities still remain as before. But unless this plane be given, so that thus corporeals may be accommodated [adapted] to the next interiors, it is not granted by the Lord to be present with angelic [spirits] even as to thoughts and affections. That he could now also be taken from inferior spirits, as to the whole body, was also shown me by means of circumvolutions, and, at the same time, foldings of his small body, similar also to the human as regards color, which was shown to be thus capable of folding [plicabile], so that he could [might] not be injured by inferior spirits, therefore by the evil; inasmuch as it was perceived that they could not inflow, and induce any pain on his body, through phantasies, as is usual with those who are not yet so prepared that they can be taken away from such [inferior spirits]. </p>
