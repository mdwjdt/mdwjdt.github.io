<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2407</h4><p>2407. The inward and very inward contents of the Lord's Word are of universal application, at all times and places<p>I spoke with angels about the contents of the Word of the Lord, [saying] that they are also applicable to the Churches of our time, as they were to the most ancient and ancient ones. Consequently, they apply to the Churches of every period, yet with variation, according to the changes that are bound to arise. Because there are so many varieties, the Churches are just like families, in which there is always a certain commonly prevailing characteristic that distinguishes one family from another.<p>I added that the Church is like a single individual, whose head is the Lord, just as every society is said to be a composite person. 1748, 25 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2407</h4><p>2407. THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERIOR AND MORE INTERIOR THINGS OF THE LORD'S WORD IS UNIVERSAL, AND IN ALL TIMES AND PLACES. <p>I spoke with angels concerning those things that are in the Lord's Word, that they apply also to the churches of our time, as well as to the Most Ancient and Ancient, therefore to the churches of all times, but with a variety according to the changes that arise and because the varieties are so many, they are circumstanced like families, in which there is always some characteristic prevailing in its common principle, that distinguishes one from another, as well as that the church is, as it were a man whose head is the Lord, like as every society is called a composite person. - 1748, June 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2407 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2407. Quod applicatio interiorum et intimiorum Verbi Domini sit universalis et omni tempore et loco<p>Loquutus cum angelis, de iis quae in Verbo Domini, quod applicentur quoque ad nostri temporis Ecclesias, sicut quoque ad antiquissimam, et antiquam, sic quod ad Ecclesias omnis temporis, sed cum varietate secundum mutationes oriundas, et quia tot sunt varietates, eae se habent sicut familiae, in quibus semper aliquod characteristicum <sup>1</sup></p><p>est, quod distinguit unam ab ltera, quod regnat in ejus communi, tum quod Ecclesia sit quasi homo, cujus caput est Dominus, sicut omnis societas dicitur persona composita. 1748, 25 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has charastericum </p>
