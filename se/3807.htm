<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3807</h4><p>3807. After that he was wound up horizontally around a staff as an axis, into a plate, and rolled into a long, dark, thick plate, presently so long that it could not be unrolled from that axis or staff because of its length, for so much always remained. This was their punishment for claiming to be from eternity, so it is turned into something that is without end, thus a perpetual earthly action. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3807</h4><p>3807. Being afterwards made to revolve [or to be rolled] around an axis or staff transversely placed, [he was, as it were, flattened or thinned out] to a kind of lamina [or plate], and continuing to be thus rolled he became a lamina more and more extended, and at the same time obscure and dense, till finally its length precluded its being any further rolled upon the same cylinder, for [however much of it was rolled] till just so much always remained; which was the punishment for saying that they were from eternity, viz., this being turned into something without end, thus [denoting] a perpetual natural. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3807 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3807. Postea circumvolutus circum axem seu baculum transverse positum, in laminam, et revolutus in laminam longam obscuram densam, mox tam longam, ut ab axe seu baculo isto non revolvi posset, prae longitudine, nam tantum semper remanebat, quod est poena quod ab aeterno se dicant, ita vertitur in tale quod est absque fine, sic quod perpetuum naturale. </p>
