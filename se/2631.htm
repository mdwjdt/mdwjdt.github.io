<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2631</h4><p>2631. The Hebrew Language has nothing artificial, [but is] as when spirits are speaking<p>The Hebrew Language is such as to embrace ideas, and in fact each of the words contain many ideas, so that they are general ideas more than the words of any other language. This is clear from many considerations, among others that there had been no vowels there so that the meaning of the letter would be known from the inward meaning, but not the inward meaning from the meaning of the letter, which is what happens instead when vowels are attached [see <a href="2414.htm">2414</a>]. Therefore, one who sees the meaning of the letter from the inward meaning understands better without vowels what was written by Hebrew letters, than with them.<p>Therefore also words that are names are not signaled by initial capitals, therefore neither is there any punctuation by means of commas, and the like, as in languages in which the attention is on the meaning of the letter. Furthermore, the mode of speaking in the Word is natural, not artificial, as is clearly evident from many things, as for example that they speak almost everywhere as if the very person were speaking, and it is not said that he spoke thus, but [it is] as if he himself were speaking. So in other cases. 1748, 17 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2631</h4><p>2631. THAT THE HEBREW LANGUAGE IS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT THERE IS NOTHING ARTIFICIAL [THEREIN], AS IN THE SPEECH OF SPIRITS. <p>That the Hebrew language is of such a nature as to comprehend ideas, yea, the words such that in everyone there are many ideas, so that they are general [communes] ideas rather than words of another language, may be apparent from many things, as also that in it [ibi] there have been no vowels, so that the sense of the letter was known from the interior sense, but not the interior sense from the sense of the letter, which the rather happens when the vowels are adjoined; wherefore he who perceives the sense of the letter from the interior sense better understands what is written in the Hebrew language without vowels than with them. Therefore names also [voces nominum] are not distinguished by capital initials [initalibus majoribus]; therefore also there is no distinction by means of commas, and the like as in languages in which the sense of the letter is regarded [attenditur]. Besides also the mode of speaking in the Word is natural, not artificial, as may be plainly apparent from many things; to wit, that nearly everywhere they speak as if the person himself spoke: it is not said that he thus spoke, but [it is] as if he were speaking, and so forth [ita in aliis]. - 1748, July 17. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2631 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2631. Quod Lingua Hebraica talis, ut nihil artificiale sit, sicut dum loquuntur spiritus<p>Quod Lingua Hebraica talis sit, ut comprehendat ideas, et quidem tales sint voces, ut in unaquavis sint ideae plures, sic ut sint ideae communes magis quam voces linguae alius, constare potest ex multis, tum quoque quod vocales ibi nullae fuerint, ut sensus literae ex sensu interiori nosceretur, non autem sensus interior a sensu littrae, quod fit potius, dum vocales sunt adjunctae <sup>1</sup></p><p>[vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2631/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2414" target=_top>2414</a>]; quare qui sensum literae ex sensu interiori percipit, is melius intelligit quid scriptum litera hebraea absque vocalibus, quam cum iis; ideo quoque voces nominum nec distinguuntur initialibus majoribus, ideo quoque nec distinctio per commata, et similia, quae in linguis, in quibus attenditur ad sensum literae: praeterea etiam naturalis est modus loquendi in Verbo, non artificialis, sicut manifeste constare potest a multis, quod nempe loquantur ubivis fere, sicut persona ipsa loqueretur, et non dicitur, quod sic loquutus, sed quasi ille loqueretur, ita in aliis. 1748, 17 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
