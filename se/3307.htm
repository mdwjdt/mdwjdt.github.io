<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3307</h4><p>3307. About a woman who desired promiscuous sex<p>There was a woman who, not knowing what the marriage debt is, i.e., that only one wife and one husband make a marriage, was examined, and found to be the kind to desire promiscuous sex. Because she was at the same time deceitful, she was chastised by means of a long snake that entered, and then - because she was unwilling to stop defending [the practice] - by the snake taking away her tongue, after which she was sent to Gehenna. 1748, 24 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3307</h4><p>3307. CONCERNING A WOMAN WHO DESIRED PROMISCUOUS VENERY.<p>There was a woman, who was ignorant that the conjugial debt requires that but one wife, and one husband, shall be united in marriage. She was explored and discovered to be such a one as desired promiscuous venery. Inasmuch as she was deceitful, she was at the same time chastised [castigata] by means of a long serpent, which entered; and then because she was not willing to refrain from defending [her conduct] [she was punished] by a serpent, which took away her tongue; and afterwards she was sent to Gehenna. - 1748, September 24. </p>
