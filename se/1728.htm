<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1728</h4><p>1728. I heard them speaking, and they were unassuming, peaceful, saying that in bodily life they had been the kind who do not trust their own thinking very much and consequently cannot make up their minds, but are gullible, allowing themselves to be easily convinced by others of anything at all and acting on their suggestions without questioning their worth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1728</h4><p>1728. I heard them speaking: they were modest and peaceable, and said that in the life of the body they were such as trusted but little to their own thought, or determined themselves but were prone to credulity, and easily suffered themselves to be persuaded by others to almost anything, acting from their suggestions, and not canvassing the quality of their advice. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1728 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1728. Audivi eos loquentes, modesti erant, pacifici, et dicebant, quod in vita corporis fuerint ii, qui non multum suae cogitationi fidunt, et sic [non multum] se determinant, sed creduli sint, et facile ad quodcunque ab aliis persuaderi se patiuntur, a quorum consiliis agunt, non ventilantes quale sit. </p>
