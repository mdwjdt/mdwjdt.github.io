<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3992</h4><p>3992. Today there is no faith<p>And concerning the modern tree of knowledge<p>Being under attack throughout the night by cruel evil spirits, to a point that I awoke several times, I saw boys whom they were correcting, whom they were combing so cruelly, as if with saws, that blood was flowing from their heads, and they were hitting severely on the back. Intensely cruel were these fantasies all night long, from which I could not get free. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3992</h4><p>3992. THAT AT THIS DAY THERE IS NO FAITH; AND CONCERNING THE MODERN TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.<p>I was infested during the whole night by evil and cruel spirits, insomuch that being occasionally awakened, I saw parents who would reform their children combing them as cruelly as if with saws, so that the blood ran from their head, besides which they lashed them severely on the back. Their phantasies, which were continued through the whole night, were cruel to the last degree, and held me in a state of subjection from which I was unable to liberate myself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3992 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3992. Quod hodie nulla fides, deque hodierna arbore scientiae<p>A malis spiritibus et crudelibus per totam noctem infestatus, adeo ut aliquoties expergefactus, visi pueri, quos emendarent, quos pecterent, tam crudeliter, quasi securibus, ut sanguis e capite flueret, et dorsum percuterent, in summum crudeles erant phantasiae, per totam noctem, e qua liberari non potui. </p>
