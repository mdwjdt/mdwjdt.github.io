<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4951</h4><p>4951. In a word, such magicians and such who flow in of their own accord are unworthy of life, because they are the ruin of the human race.<p>I spoke with those in the city. They said that they are such that they cannot be forced to become better there, saying that they do what is good and then evil of itself reacts in opposition and that the league of them is so great that when they say these things, they cannot be hurt in any way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4951</h4><p>4951. In a word, such magicians and such as inflow into the voluntary part [i. e. those from whom the magicians received their influx] are not worthy to live, because they are destroyers of the human race. I spoke with those in the city, who said that such ones cannot there be constrained to become better, for they say that they do good, and also that evils are crushed by them, and that their connection [with the magicians] is so close that when they speak thus they cannot be hurt in any wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4951 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4951. Verbo tales magi, et tales qui voluntarie influunt, non digni sunt ut vivant, quia sunt pernicies generis humani. Loquutus cum illis in urbe, qui dicebant, quod tales sint ut non possint ibi adstringi ad meliorationem, dicendo quod faciant bonum, et dein quod contranitatur e se malum, et quod eorum tanta liga sit, ut cum ita dicunt, non possint ullo modo laedi. </p>
