<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4183</h4><p>4183. <sup>1</sup>About mankind before the flood<p>At a considerable distance overhead, there were many who were streaming into my thoughts and as it were holding them bound, and thereby in obscurity, pressing down upon me quite heavily. The spirits with me were likewise being held by them as if bound, so that they were hardly able to think except what streamed in from them, this to the point of indignation.<p>I was told that these were those who had lived just before the flood, from whom the Nephilim came, spoken of in the Word, for it is evident in the Word that those who were from the Nephilim had lived before the flood. From such an inflow as I have described, I discovered that their power of persuasion was very strong, but not equal to that of those who perished. 1749, 26 March. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph in the autograph is emphasized marginally by a wavy vertical line.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4183</h4><p>4183. CONCERNING MAN BEFORE THE FLOOD.<p>At a considerable distance above the head were numbers who flowed into my thoughts and held them as it were bound, and thus in obscurity, with the sensation of a strong pressing down upon me. The spirits with me were held by them as if bound in a similar manner, so that they were scarcely able to think except as from their influx, which excited indignation. It was said to me that these were they who lived immediately before the flood, of whom were the Nephilim [giants] spoken of in the Word, which makes particular mention of the living of these Nephilim before the flood. From such an influx as I have described it was discovered that their persuasive principle was very strong, but not equal to that of those who perished. - 1749, March 26. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4183 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4183. De homine ante diluvium<p>Supra caput ad aliquam altitudinem fuerunt plures, qui influebant in cogitationes meas, et eas quasi vinctas tenebant, et sic in obscuro, satis valide incumbentes, spiritus apud me, similiter quasi vincti ab iis tenebantur, ut parum cogitare possent, nisi quod ab iis influebat, et hoc usque ad indignationem; mihi dictum, quod illi essent, qui vixerunt proxime ante diluvium, ex quibus Nephilim, de quibus in Verbo, nam quod vixerint, qui a Nephilim, qui ante diluvium, constat ibi; compertum quod apud hos persuasivum satis forte erat, ex influxu tali, sed non tantum, quantum apud eos, qui perierunt. 1749, 26 Martius. </p>
