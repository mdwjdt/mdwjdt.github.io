<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4896</h4><p>4896. After this I was led back by a steep descent and in fact into the valley where I had been before.

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4896</h4><p>4896. I was afterwards brought back, through a great descent and, in fact, into a valley where I had been previously. From these are visible, here and there, some who are on the mountains, as if they were in a height to which there is no slope - when yet there are slopes on every side, by which it may be ascended. </p>
