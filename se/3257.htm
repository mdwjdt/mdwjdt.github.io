<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3257</h4><p>3257. And because they were growing angry, in order to signal their anger, they brought on a painful kind of contraction on the right side of the head as far as the ear, imagining they had been able to do this on their own power. Moreover, when they were going away, they distanced themselves little by little, but going down lower, because they were now being compelled to humble themselves. 1748, 22 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3257</h4><p>3257. And inasmuch as they were angry, in order that they might signify their anger, they brought upon [into] the right part of the head, as far as the ear, a certain kind of contraction and pain, supposing that they must have done it from themselves. Moreover, when they departed, they removed themselves [se elongaboet] by degrees, but deep below [profundius], inasmuch as they were thus compelled to humble themselves. -l748, September 22.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3257 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3257. Et quia irascebantur, ut iracundiam suam significarent, dextrae parti capitis usque ad aurem inferebant quandam contractionis speciem et dolorem, putantes quod id potuissent facere ex semet; praeterea cum abirent, se elongabant paullatim sed profundius, quia se humiliare sic adigebantur. 1748, 22 Sept. </p>
