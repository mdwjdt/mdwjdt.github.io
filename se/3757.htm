<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3757</h4><p>3757. As regards life in the body, about which I spoke next with spirits - saying, for instance, that some know the streets of the city, some how to cleanse the filth of the streets, others how to make shoes - then they said that still these people live. But I was prompted to reply that this is the life of brute animals, for animals know more and better the things pertaining to their body than people do, and if they had needed shoes, they would have made them much better than people do for themselves, as is evident from the nests of birds which they build so neatly, but because they have no need of shoes, they do not develop that skill. So that kind of life is the life of brute animals, because it consists of bodily things. If they had need of garments, they would be able to make them more fittingly than people, so they even do clothe themselves in much more beautiful garments than people. Hence they came to the conclusion that things belonging to the body are what we have in common with beasts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3757</h4><p>3757. As to what pertains to the life of the body, concerning which I afterwards spoke with spirits [remarking] for instance that some were acquainted with the streets of cities, some know how to cleanse its filth, others how to make shoes, they then said that such persons still lived; but it was given to reply, that this is the life of brutes, for they know all these things and many more pertaining to their bodies than man does, and if they were so framed as to have had need of shoes, they would have made them much better than man makes his, as is evident from the nests of birds, which they construct with so much ingenuity; but inasmuch as they have no need of these things, they have no skill in them; wherefore the life of the brutes is such as it is, because they are corporeal. If they had had need of garments, they could have made them much more expertly than man, as appears from their being clad in more beautiful raiment than he is. It is hence given to conclude that such things as pertain to the body are the things which are common to the beasts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3757 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3757. Quod vitam corporis attinet, de qua cum spiritibus loquutus dein, sicut quod aliqui sciunt plateas urbis, aliquis sordes platearum abstergere, alii calceamenta facere, tunc dicebant, quod ii usque vivant, sed respondere datum, quod haec vita est brutorum, nam ea sciunt plura ac meliora talia quae ad corpus eorum pertinent, quam homo, et si opus habuissent calceamentis, quod multo melius ea fecissent quam homo sibi, sicut constat ex nidis eorum, quos ita concinne construunt, sed quia non opus habent, non callent, quare talis vita est brutorum vita, quia corporeorum; si opus habuissent vestibus, potuissent concinnius eas facere quam homines, quare etiam pulchrioribus multo vestibus amiciuntur quam homo; inde concludere datum, quod talia quae ad corpus pertinent, sint talia quae communia sunt cum bestiis. </p>
