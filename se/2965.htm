<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2965</h4><p>2965. As regards those bonds by which spirits are held in the world of spirits, they are recognized by the same characteristic: they are given the liberty to act according to their desires, but are nevertheless led in such a way that [they obtain] what they desire by a letting go, and presently by a drawing in of the reins, so to speak, so that what opposes [their desires] is constantly streaming in from others, and this they do not know. So they imagine that they are living their own life and are in freedom, for they are so led along the sequences of their desires, but not beyond the limits whereby good may result, for themselves and for the rest. 1748, 28 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2965</h4><p>2965. As respects the bonds wherein spirits are held in the world of spirits, they are known from the resemblance [just mentioned], that liberty of acting according to [their] cupidities is granted them, but still they are led so that what they desire is with admission and next with restriction, as it were: thus continually inflows from others what is opposed [to their cupidities], [though] they are ignorant of this. Therefore they think they live their own life, and are in liberty; for they are led by series of their cupidities, but not beyond limits, in such a manner that, hence, good may exist to them and the rest. - 1748, August 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2965 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2965. Quod vincula attinet ea, quibus tenentur spiritus in mundo spirituum, noscuntur ex simili, qoud detur iis libertas agendi secundum cupiditates, sed usque [ita] ducuntur, ut quod cupiunt, it cum admissione, et mox cum restrictione quasi, sic continue, et hoc nesciunt, ab aliis influit quod opponitur; sic vivere putant se suam vitam, et in libertate esse, nam per cupiditatum suarum series ita ducuntur, sed non ultra limites, quin bonum inde existat, ad eos, et caeteros. 1748, 28 Aug. </p>
