<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3951</h4><p>3951. When he was asked how he had conceived of the supreme deity, there appeared to me Someone up above at the left, with a human face, and girded about the head with a kind of radiant circle. It was said that he had had a mental image of God as being such, and had so conceived of Him, that having thought of God in this way, he consequently had had some idea of the Lord, Whom he now, like all good spirits, confesses, saying that He governs the universe, for he who governs heaven rules the universe - the one cannot be separated from the other. These also are his words. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3951</h4><p>3951. I asked him what idea he had of the supreme Deity. There appeared to me a certain [form] at the left above, having a human face, and his head surrounded with a kind of radiant circle. It was said that he had such an idea concerning God, having exhibited Him to himself somewhat in this form. He said that he had so thought of God, and thus had some idea of the Lord; yet he now, as a good spirit acknowledges him, and says that he rules the universe, for he that rules heaven rules the universe; the one cannot be separated from the other. These also are his sayings. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3951 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3951. Quaesitum qualem ideam habuerit de summo numine, visus mihi Quidam ad sinistrum supra, facie humana et circum caput cinctus circulo quodam radioso, dictum quod talem ideam habuerit, de Deo, quod talis, sicut stiterit sibi Ipsum, dixit quod ita cogitaverit de Deo, proinde quod aliquam ideam habuerit Domini, Quem nunc, ut boni spiritus confitetur, et dicit quod Ipse regat universum, nam qui coelum regit, regit universum, unum ab altero separari nequit; haec quoque ejus sunt. </p>
