<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5624</h4><p>5624. I spoke with some like this and asked what space is and what is time is, but they did not know at all. They called the spaces, from the variety of their appearance, either beautiful or not beautiful; and [speak of] times in another way; they were qualities of life. It is important to know that there are still spaces and times, but from the foregoing it follows that they have no [time-based] concept of them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5624</h4><p>5624. I spoke with some such ones, and I asked what space is, and what time; but they were entirely unaware. They called spaces, after the variation of appearance, either beautiful or not beautiful; but times differently, saying that they were qualities of life. It must be known, however, that they are still spaces and times; but it is owing to the reasons here assigned that the angels have not any notion of them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5624 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5624. Loquutus sum quibusdam talibus, et interrogabam quid spatium, et quid tempus, sed nesciebant prorsus, vocabant spatia ex visus varietate, vel pulchra, vel non pulchra; et tempora aliter, quod essent qualitates vitae. At sciendum quod usque sint spatia et tempora, sed inde est, quod nullam eorum notionem habeant. </p>
