<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2078</h4><p>2078. When this spirit had been examined, it was said that he could not be bent around toward any goodness, thus that it was his inborn nature to do this. This must first be rooted out, and to root it out would be a long job, for it is a subtle poison that he finds very sweet; so he is unable to desist. It consisted in behaving deceptively under the guise of another person's pleasantness, which he had so to speak appropriated to himself. 1748, 25 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2078</h4><p>2078. After the examination of that spirit, it was said that he could not be inclined to aught that was good, therefore that it was his innate nature so to act; which must first be extirpated. To extirpate this would require much time, for it is a subtle poison, which to him seems the sweetest thing; wherefore he cannot desist, as is manifest from his treacherously acting in, as it were, appropriating to himself the delight of another. - 1748, May 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2078 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2078. Spiritus is examinatus, dicebatur, quod non potuit flecti ad aliquod bonum, sic quod innatum naturae ejus sit, ita facere, quod prius exstirpandum, quo exstirpando multo tempore opus, nam est subtile venenum, quod ei dulcissimum sentitur, quare non desistere potest, constabat in eo quod sub amaenitate alterius sibi quasi adpropriata dolose faceret. 1748, 25 Maj. </p>
