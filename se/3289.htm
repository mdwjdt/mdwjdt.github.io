<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3289</h4><p>3289.

Angered on this account, they said angrily that I know nothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3289</h4><p>3289. But yet they cannot know from other spirits more than the Lord grants; which was also shown them in my case; although previously it was granted them to know something, as well by their exploring as by living voice, it was now suddenly closed, so that they could know nothing from me; wherefore, being angry they said angrily that I knew nothing. </p>
