<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5452</h4><p>5452. About the Russian People<p>The Russian people dwell in the southeastern quarter, right in the corner under the earth there. They are in greater obscurity than the rest. I was led there and first I saw a dirty place where there were many who were deliberating about matters pertaining to their kingdom, indeed, about the nature of liberty in other places. But they were not seen, they were entirely undercover. Then I heard one saying that they were afraid of the czar and that the czar was everywhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5452</h4><p>5452. ABOUT THE RUSSIAN NATION <p>The Russian nation dwells in the south-eastern angle - right in the angle - under the earth there. They are in greater darkness than the rest. I was conveyed to that part; and, at first, I saw a dirty place where were many who deliberated about matters relating to their kingdom, and indeed about liberty such as [is enjoyed] in other countries; but they did not show themselves; they were in complete concealment. I afterwards heard one saying that they feared the Czar, and that the Czar was everywhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5452 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5452. De Gente Russica<p>Gens Russica habitat ad angulum orientali meridionalem prorsus in angulo sub terra ibi, est illis obscurum prae reliquis; perlatus sum illuc, et vidi primum locum immundum, ubi plures erant qui consultabant de rebus regni sui, et quidem de libertate qualis alibi, sed non apparebant, erant prorsus in incognito, dein audivi dicentem quod caesarem timerent, et quod caesar esset ubivis. </p>
