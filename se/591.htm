<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第591节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>591.我还以此处哲学化的方式与另一个星球的灵人交谈，也就是说，当描述灵人、灵魂和类似不可见的实体时，他们移除了人的观念能够把握的一切元素，比如地方、组成部分、形状等等，以至于没有留下任何概念，因而也没有留下任何术语用来表达那些与灵人和类似东西有关的事物，称它们为非物质的等等。他们就这样将它们包裹在术语之中，最后赋予它们玄妙的属性。于是。他们最终怀疑在那些感官所理解的事物里面或之外究竟有没有什么东西，许多人是否认（至少心里否认）的。因此，他们否认灵人的存在，否认属灵事物，否认天上的事物，以为自己将要和其它动物一样死去，他们甚至不知道如何将自己和动物区分开来；尽管如此，他们竟然还想被视为学识渊博！此外，他们将这类术语联系在一起，从而开发许多主题，而这些主题纯粹是学术术语；它们若被展开，就会展现出一种简单、易于表达的含义。木星灵嘲笑这些和类似东西，并再次称这些人为疯子；如果他们的思维沉浸于这类事物，被它们缠住或网罗的话，他们会说这些人是粪堆。（1748年1月28日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 591</h4><p>591. There was also conversation with spirits of the other earth on the manner of philosophizing here, namely, that when those here are describing spirits, souls, and similar invisible entities, they remove all elements on which human ideas can have a grip, such as locality, components, shapes, and the like, and leave no idea and consequently no term, by which to express those things which have to do with spirits and the like, calling them immaterial, etc., thus wrapping them in terms, finally [assigning them] occult properties. Thus they end up doubting whether there is anything within, or beyond, those things which the senses grasp, and many deny that there is (at least at heart). So they deny the existence of spirits, they deny spiritual things, they deny heavenly things, supposing that they will die, as all other animals do, from which they do not even know to distinguish themselves - and nevertheless they want to be thought learned. Moreover, they connect together their terms and thereby develop many themes that are nothing but scholarly terminology which, if unwrapped, exhibits a simple, easily expressible meaning.<p>The spirits of the planet Jupiter laugh about these and similar matters, and again they are calling such people insane - and manure, if their thinking is immersed and bound up, or entrapped, in such things.<p>1748, the 28th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 591</h4><p>591. I also spoke with spirits of another earth on the way they philosophize here, namely, that when they describe spirits, souls, and like things which are invisible, they then remove all things upon which human ideas may affix themselves, as place, parts, figures, and similar things, so that they leave no idea, consequently no word by which to express those things that have regard to spirits and similar things, and call them immaterial, and the like. They so involve them in terms, and at length in occult qualities, that they finally come to doubt whether there is anything within those things which the senses apprehend, which very many deny, at least inwardly. Thus they deny the existence of spirits, they deny the existence of spiritual things, they deny the existence of celestial things, so they suppose that they will die like other animals, from which they do not even know how to distinguish themselves. And yet they still want to be called learned! Moreover, they connect such terms and hence bundle many things together which are mere scholastic terms, which, if unfolded, would exhibit a simple sense easily expressible. The spirits of the planet Jupiter laugh at these and like things, and again called such men insane, and, if their thoughts are such that they are immersed in and entangled or ensnared by such things, dung. 1748, Jan. 28. </p>
