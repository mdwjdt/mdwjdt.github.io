<p>263.关于灵人的教导性，关于巫术。除了很长时间以来我所拥有的一个接一个的许多经历外，我今天还通过一个罕见的经历获知：灵人是可教导人的，事实上，他们急切地抓住超出想象的东西；埃及人在自然层面的巫术正是由于这个原因。有众多灵人试图说出这些事，但由于这样做是可憎的、亵渎的，所以他们的口立刻被封上，并被赶出那里的社群。对那里的社群来说，他们就是可憎的害虫，故被关在一个他们无法再将其巫术传给其他人的地方。他们只是为了试探才被允许到我这里来。（1747年11月23日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 263</h4><p>263. About the teachability of spirits, and about magic<p>Besides the many experiences I have had one after another over a long period, I have also today learned through some unique ones that spirits are teachable, and in fact avidly seize upon things that are beyond imagination; also, that the Egyptians' magic on the plane of nature resulted from this fact. For there are very many spirits who try to utter such things, but because it is abominable and profane to do so, their mouth is immediately closed up, and they are cast out from the society. Since they are abominable pests to societies there, they are kept in a place where they are no longer able to communicate their magical powers to others. They are only given access to me for the purpose of temptation. 1747, 23 November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 263</h4><p>263. CONCERNING THE TEACHABLENESS [docilitas] OF SPIRITS, AND CONCERNING MAGIC <p>Besides the many experiences I have had repeatedly for a long time, I have also learnt today by a certain particular experience, that spirits are teachable [docilis], and indeed eagerly seize upon those things which no one can imagine for himself; and also that the natural magic of the Egyptians was due to that cause. For there are very many spirits who try to say similar things, but because it is abominable and profane their mouth is immediately closed, and they are cast out of the society; for they are abominable pests of societies there, consequently they are held in a place where they can no longer communicate their magical arts to others. They were only admitted to me for the sake of temptation. 1747, Nov. 23, o.s. </p>
