<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4422</h4><p>4422. In what manner many will receive what is being written through me<p>I received a letter saying that not more than four copies <sup>1</sup>had been sold within 2 months, and when this was made known to the angels, they were indeed surprised, but they said that it must be left to the Providence of the Lord, and that it is such that it compels no one - which could have been done, but that it is not fitting that any others should read it first than those who have faith, and that this is also known from the Lord's coming into the world, who also could have compelled them to receive His words, and Himself, but compelled no one, as was also the case afterwards by means of the apostles. But still those were found who received, being those who had faith, to whom the apostles were also sent.<p>It was also shown how it was with the rest in the Christian world by their being let into the state in which they had been in their bodily life, and they were prompted to think on those things which have been written - about the other life, and in the unfolding of the inner sense - and they felt as if they would vomit, spitting out all those things, which they also told, and admitted.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The book here referred to is Arcana Coelestia First Part, published in London, 1749. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4422</h4><p>4422. IN WHAT MANNER THAT WILL BE RECEIVED BY MANY WHICH IS WRITTEN THROUGH ME.<p>I received letters [informing me] that not more than four copies had been sold in two months, and this was made known to the angels: they wondered indeed, but said that it should be left to the Providence of the Lord, which was such as to compel no one, though it might be done, but that it was not fitting that [any others] should read [my work] first but those who were in faith; and that this might be known from [what happened at] the coming of the Lord into the world, who was able to compel men to receive His words and Himself, but [yet] compelled no one, as was also the case afterwards in regard to the apostles; but still there were found those who would receive, to wit, those who were in faith, to whom also the apostles were sent. It was thus shown, moreover, how the case is with others in the Christian world, by the circumstance that [some spirits] were remitted into the state in which they were in the life of the body, it being then given them to think concerning those things which were written about the other life, and in explication of the internal sense, and they were then as if they would vomit; thus rejecting all those things, which they also said [they did], and thus confessed the truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4422 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4422. Quomodo multi recepturi illud quod scribitur per me<p>Accepi literas quod non plura exemplaria inter 2 menses vendita sint quam quatuor <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et hoc notum factum angelis, mirati quidem sunt, sed dixerunt, quod Providentiae Domini relinquendum, et quod illa talis sit, quod neminem cogat, quod fieri potuisset, sed non conveniat, ut illud legant primum, quam illi qui in fide sunt; et quod tale quoque notum sit a Domini adventu in mundum, Qui etiam cogere potuit illos ad recipienda verba Ipsius, et Ipsum, sed neminem coegit, ita postea per apostolos, sed usque inventi sunt qui receperunt, quod fuerint illi qui in fide, ad quos quoque apostoli missi sunt: ostensum porro quomodo [se] habet cum caeteris, in orbe Christiano, per id, quod missi in statum in quo fuerunt in vita corporis, et iis tunc datum cogitare de illis quae scripta sunt, de altera vita et in explicatione de sensu interno, ii tunc fuerunt sicut vomerent, ita respuentes omnia illa, quod etiam ii dicebant et fassi sunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;refert hic ad opus Arcana Coelestia, Partem Primam, Londini 1749 editiam </p>
