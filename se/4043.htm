<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4043</h4><p>4043. The vessels of the memory are arranged, with those who have faith, by the Lord, with all by the Lord through the angels in community, there being a variety of communities, without which angels could not be present. The particulars of the communities consist of mankind or of spirits, so there cannot be any other particulars than those pertaining to the communities or generals, as otherwise nothing particular can exist in the whole of nature.</p><p>[2] Every general has countless particulars having different tonalities, as in the case of musical instruments, even discordant ones, constituting a general aura, which is more or less extended. Not only the communities themselves are changed by the Lord, but there are also countless groupings of communities or generals, so that groupings of many general communities constitute one community, as is also the case with blendings of desires, and </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4043</h4><p>4043. The vessels of the memory, with those that are in faith, are disposed by the Lord; with all by the Lord through angels, in a general way [in communi], with a variation of generals, as otherwise angels could not be present. The particulars of generals belong to men or spirits; thus no other particulars can coincide than such as pertain to generals, as otherwise nothing particular could exist in universal nature. Every general has indefinite particulars, though some are discordant and opposite, as in musical instruments; thus arises a general sphere, which exists more or less extended. These generals are not only changed by the Lord, but there are also indefinite consociations of generals, so that the generals of many things constitute one general, as there are also mixtures of cupidities and indefinite consociations of affections. </p>
