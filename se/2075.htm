<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2075</h4><p>2075. About more subtle spirits<p>There was a spirit who was operating more subtly than others, entering into good feelings, appropriating them to himself, and then deceiving. This was a natural trait for him, and for those who kept him company, but his subtlety could nevertheless do him no good, for it was immediately noticed and seen through - even more so by the angels. He is now being examined. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2075</h4><p>2075. CONCERNING THE MORE SUBTLE SPIRITS. <p>There was a spirit who acted in a more subtle manner than others, by entering good affections, appropriating them to himself, and thus deceiving, which was natural to him and to those who were with him in company; but never could his subtlety avail aught. It was immediately discovered and perceived by good spirits, much more by angels. He is now undergoing examination. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2075 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2075. De spiritibus subtilioribus<p>Erat spiritus, qui subtilius aliis agebat, intrando in affectiones bonas, eas sibi appropriando, et sic decipiendo, quod ei naturale erat, ac iis qui cum eo in consortio, sed usque subtilitas ejus nihil prodesse potuit, a spiritibus bonis illico animadversa et percepta est, multo magis ab angelis; is nunc examinatur. </p>
