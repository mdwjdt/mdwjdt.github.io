<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4365</h4><p>4365. About the hypocrite<p>While he was moving many who were toward the front with his poisonous talk, who were seen as if reclining at a table filled with dainties, and listening to him, whose poisonous discourse they were finding delightful, then suddenly their table was thrown forward into their faces, and instead of dainties, a snake skin drifted into their faces from his speech, and they were cast out and dispersed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4365</h4><p>4365. CONCERNING THE HYPOCRITE [ABOVE MENTIONED].<p>While he was working by his poisonous discourse upon many who were in front and who seemed to be sitting at a table filled with dainties and listening to him with great deference, having been powerfully wrought upon by his specious but venomous talk, all of a sudden the table was thrown in their faces, and instead of their dainties a kind of serpent-slaver flowed from his speech into their faces, and they were themselves cast out and dissipated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4365 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4365. De hypocrita<p>Cum affecerit venenata sua loquela plures qui antrorsum, qui visi tunc accumbere quasi ad mensam cum delitiis et auscultare eum, cujus loquela venenata <sup>1</sup></p><p>deliciabantur, tunc eorum mensa subito projecta in facies eorum, et loco deliciarum, ormrem <sup>2</sup></p><p>in facies ejus a loquela ejus influebat, et illi projecti et dissipati.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;= hypocrita, cumprimis qualis pietatem affectat (vox gallica, a Tartuffe, persona principali in comoedia Molieris, 1664)<p>2.&nbsp;= exuviae serpentis (vox suecica) </p>
