<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>403.伊斯兰教的灵人非常温顺并服从他们的穆罕默德，发自内心为他履行一切职责，这与基督教界的许多灵人不同。我再次与穆罕默德交谈（参看339,344节），这时，那些接受不同教导，也就是被教导如何以一种不同的新方式取悦穆罕默德，或如何使他快乐的灵人被派到我这里。他说，他想把这种快乐和愉悦传给我，但这事没有被允许。不过，他说，他获得允许打发一些灵人过来，以便他能向我展示他们是何等地可教并顺服。然后，这些灵人被教导说，他们应当单单崇拜弥赛亚神，事实上无论是小是大；因为每个人都被赋予崇拜掌管宇宙的弥赛亚神的特权。他们被这一指示所激发，极其谦卑地向神献上感谢，并承认说，他们会这事放在心里。（1747年12月26日）<p>他们被教导要从头到脚愉快地进行一种沐浴。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 403</h4><p>403. Mohammedan spirits are very teachable, obedient to their Mohammed, doing him every kindness from the heart, differently from many spirits in the Christian world<p>Once again I spoke with Mohammed [see <a href="339.htm">339</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>], and then spirits were sent to me who had been taught differently, that is, who had been taught how to delight Mohammed in a different and new way, or how to cause him pleasure. He said that he had wanted to pass this delight and pleasure on to me, but it was not permitted. However, he said that he did manage to send over spirits, so that he could show me how teachable and obedient they were.<p>These spirits were then taught that they should adore God the Messiah Alone, and indeed, both small and great; for everyone is given the privilege to adore God the Messiah, Who governs the universe. By this instruction they were excited, and gave thanks to God most humbly, promising they would take this to heart. 1747, the 26th day of December.<p>They were taught to cause a kind of washing from the head to the feet, with the accompanying enjoyment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 403</h4><p>403. THAT MAHOMEDAN SPIRITS ARE VERY DOCILE AND OBEDIENT TO THEIR MAHOMED, AND PERFORM ALL OFFICES TO HIM FROM THE HEART; IT IS OTHERWISE WITH MANY SPIRITS IN CHRISTENDOM <p>I again spoke with Mahomed [see nos. <a href="../se/339.htm">339</a>, <a href="../se/344.htm">344</a>, and spirits who were obstructed differently were thence sent to me. These had been instructed in another and new way of making delights for Mahomed, or of introducing enjoyments, which he said he wanted to have transmitted to me: but it was not permitted. But he said that he had obtained permission to transmit spirits that he might show their docility and obedience. These were then instructed that they should adore God Messiah alone, and indeed both the small and the great, for to everyone leave is given to adore God Messiah Who governs the universe. By this instruction they were entitled, and gave thanks to God most humbly, promising that it should be in their heart. 1747, Dec. 26. <p>They have been taught to induce a kind of bath from head to foot, with delight. </p>
