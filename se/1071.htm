<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1071</h4><p>1071. On the punishment of one who wanted to do everything of himself,<p>as if it were he alone; and who was deceitful as well<p>A certain spirit, who is present even now at a distance almost above the forehead, wanted to manage all things by himself, and speak as if it were he alone. So he was not anxious whether there were other spirits [involved], but indeed wanted to arrange every detail from his own brain. At the same time, he was also adept at mixing, and he was permitted to slip into several societies of the inward heaven. For he had been in the habit of mixing in with married partners in order to seduce the wives or unwed daughters, so his social mixing was deceitful as well. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1071</h4><p>1071. CONCERNING THE PUNISHMENT OF A CERTAIN ONE WHO DESIRED TO DO EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF AS THOUGH HE ALONE WAS; AT THE SAME TIME HE IS DECEITFUL <p>A certain spirit, who is now present at a distance almost above the forehead, wanted to arrange all things from himself and to speak as if he were the only one; thus he was not concerned whether other spirits were also present, because he wanted to arrange everything from his own brain. He was also an insinuator and was permitted to insinuate himself into some societies of the interior heaven, for he was accustomed to insinuate himself amongst married consorts in order that he might entice wives or unmarried daughters to whoredom. Thus his insinuations were at the same time also deceitful. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1071 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1071. De punitione cujusdam, qui ex se agere omne cupiit, quasi solus esset, et simul dolosus<p>Quidam spiritus, qui nunc etiam adest, ad distantiam super frontem paene, is omnia voluit ordinare a semet, et loqui sicut solus esset, sic ut sollicitus non esset, an alii spiritus uoque essent, quin singula ex suo cerebro vellet disponere, simul etiam is insinuatorius erat, nam permissum ei erat, se insinuare in aliquas societates coeli interioris, nam assuefactus est insinuationibus apud conjuges, ut pelliceret uxores aut filias innuptas ad scortandum, sic quoque insinuationes ejus simul quoque erant dolosae. </p>
