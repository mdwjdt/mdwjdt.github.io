<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1318</h4><p>1318. The second kind, which followed, was at the left temple, below me, resounding upwards. It was like that of a multitude of carriages and horses, as when one hears that sound of an army of very many chariots and horses on the streets. I was told that this was the clash between reasoned arguments and truths that they were unwilling to believe, for this is how reasoning clashes with truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1318</h4><p>1318. The second kind of tumult which followed was at the left temple sounding from beneath me upwards. It was like that of a very great number of carriages and horses, as when the sound of the carriages and horses of an army is heard, or of a very great number of them in the streets. I was told that this was a conflict of reasonings about truths in which they were unwilling to believe, for thus do reasonings conflict. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1318 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1318. Alterum genus erat, quod successit; erat ad sinistrum tempus, sub me, sursum sonans, sicut curruum et equorum, permultorum, sicut dum similis sonus curruum et equorum exercitus auditur, aut permulti in plateis; hoc dicebatur mihi, quod esset conflictio ratiocinationum de veritatibus, quibus non fidem habere vellent, ita enim confligunt ratiocinationes. </p>
