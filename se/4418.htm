<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4418</h4><p>4418. About Augustus<p>I spoke with Augustus, who was an upright man, but having a special air of authority that made him unwilling to have anyone speak [in his presence]. Due to his air of authority, he so inhibited me that I did not dare to speak, perhaps because he might think this would be too presumptuous toward him.<p>He showed me a round or oval window that he had in his Palace, saying that he would look through it at those who were outside, and would explore their character without them knowing it, and on anyone whom he found to be pleasing to him, he would bestow positions and honors, while the person as yet knew nothing about it.<p>He was with me for several hours. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4418</h4><p>4418. CONCERNING AUGUSTUS.<p>I spoke with Augustus; he was an upright man, but he had a peculiar sphere of authority which made him unwilling that anyone should speak to him. He so restrained me by this sphere of authority that I did not dare to address him; perhaps because he thought this would savor of undue boldness towards him. He showed me a round or oval window which he had in his palace, saying that through it he looked at those who were without, and explored their quality without their being aware of it, and that when he found anyone who pleased him, he gave him functions and honors, when as yet the man knew and expected nothing. He was with me several hours. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4418 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4418. De Augusto<p>Loquutus cum Augusto, erat vir probus, sed auctoritatis sphaeram peculiarem habebat, quod non vellet ut aliquis loqueretur, inhibebat ex sphaera auctoritatis, sic ut non auderem, forte quia hoc nimis audaciae contra eum putabat fore; ostendebat mihi rotundam fenestram, seu ovalem, quam habuit in Palatio suo, dicens quod per illam spectaverit illos qui extra fuerunt, et exploraverit quales essent, et quod hoc nesciverint, et quem invenit talem, ut sibi placeret, quod ei, cum nondum quicquam scivit, functiones et honores dederit; fuit per aliquot horas apud me. </p>
