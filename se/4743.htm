<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4743</h4><p>4743. One of those in the universe came to me. He was short and bulky with a round, woolen hat. The angel said that he was from there, and that they are extremely stubborn but yet such that they are alternately in hell and in a bright world. They were compared to marsh flies that fly up in clouds and the next moment are in the marsh. It was said that they do not know about any god. But when they are up above they call the light they see God, and when down below [they call] the darkness the Devil. Thus they acknowledge truth as God, and falsity as the devil, as also he (C[harles] XII) did.</p><p>[2] Later a certain one, the same one, came with a cup of liquid in his hand and extended it to me. It was immediately scattered in all directions. They said that they draw liquid like this in some place or other that they were unable to name, and said that they extend it to spirits when they are being dreadfully obstinate and stubborn. If the spirits then accept it, it is an indication that they are not letting up, but if they do not take it, is an indication that they are letting up. So it is that they investigate stubborn attitudes there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4743</h4><p>4743. There came one to me from those in the universe. He was a short, gross man, with a round felt hat. It was said by the angels that he was thence, and that they are of the most obstinate character, but, still, such that they are alternately in hell and in a world of brightness. They were compared to marshflies that fly upwards, in troops, and afterwards are in the marsh. It was said that they have no knowledge of any God; but that they call the light, which they see when they are above, God, and the darkness, when below, the devil thus that they acknowledge truth as God, and the false as the devil - as also he (Charles XII) did.<p>Afterwards, there came a certain one, the same I have mentioned, with a bowl of liquid in his hand, and threw the liquid towards me. It was immediately dissipated. They said, that, in a certain place, they drink such a liquid, which they could not designate; and that they throw it at spirits, when they are in their obstinacy and stubbornness: if, then, those spirits receive it, that is a sign that they should not desist from [their purpose]; but, if they do not receive, that is a sign that they should desist. Consequently, that they thus explore contumacies there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4743 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4743. Ex illis in universo unus ad me venit, erat vir curtus et crassus, cum pileo ex lana circum, dicebatur ab angelis quod ille esset inde, et quod illi sint obstinatissimi, sed usque tales ut alternis sint in inferno, alternis in mundo lucido, comparabantur muscis paludum quae sursum volant agminatim et dein in palude sunt, dicebatur quod non sciant de aliquo deo, sed quod lucem, quam vident cum supra sunt, dicant Deum, et tenebras cum infra diabolum, ita quod verum pro Deo agnoscant, et falsum pro diabolo, sicut etiam is (C: XII).<p>[2] Postea venit quidam idem cum calice liquoris in manu, et projecit liquorem versus me, qui illico dissipabatur, dicebant quod talem liquorem hauriant in quodam loco, quem non potuerunt designare, et quod projiciant in spiritus cum in sua dira obstinatione et contumacia sunt, si tunc recipiunt illum, quod signum sit quod non desistant, at si non recipiunt, quod signum sit quod desistant, proinde quod ita explorent contumacias ibi. </p>
