<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4047</h4><p>4047. About candles and lights<p>Very often I have seen candles, and the light from them round about, as if from candles [in the world]I cannot tell how many times, because it was so often - then also flames of various size and color. Yesterday I saw a dry fire in the coals of the fireplace, as I had also seen at other times, sometimes more, sometimes less dry. When it was most dry, it approached the color of coal, so that it was scarcely more than black coal, which I had also seen at times. Yesterday I saw also a hearth fire kindled with wood, and the light from it, then also two candles with bright flames, and the light coming from them. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4047</h4><p>4047. CONCERNING CANDLES AND LIGHTS.<p>Candles were often seen by me, and a light issuing from them round about as from candles [in this world]; indeed so often that I cannot recount the times. I have seen also flames of various size and color. Yesterday I beheld the dry light of a coal fire, as I have also done at other times. Occasionally the light or fire was more or less dry, but when the most so, it approached to a coal-heat, so that there was scarcely anything visible but a black coal, which also was frequently seen. Yesterday I saw the fire of a hearth kindled with wood, and the light thence; then also two candles, whereof the flame was white, and thence there shone such a light. - 1748, November 23. </p>

De candelis et luminibus<p>Perquam saepe mihi visae sunt candelae, et ab iis lumen, circum sicut a candelis, vices scire non possum, quia tam saepe: tum etiam flammas varias magnitudine et colore; heri vidi ignem foci siccum in carbonibus, sicut alioquin quoque, quandoque magis minusve siccus, cum maxime siccus, ad carbonarium colorem accedit, sic ut vix sit nisi niger carbo: quod passim quoque visum; heri vidi etiam ignem foci accensum in lignis, et lux inde; tum quoque [visae] candelae binae, quarum flamma erat candida, inde talis lux. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
