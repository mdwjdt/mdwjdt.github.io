<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2422</h4><p>2422. About drunkenness<p>I spoke with spirits about drunkenness, and they confirmed that it is an enormous sin, both because a person becomes like a brute, no longer human - because being human consists in the faculty of understanding, so one becomes like a brute - and also because it brings harm on the body and thus hastens death, besides wasting by excess resources that could be useful for many purposes. 1748, 27 June. And it appeared to them so impure that they shrank away from such a life - which mortals, however, have persuaded themselves to be civil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2422</h4><p>2422. CONCERNING DRUNKENNESS. <p>I spoke with spirits concerning drunkenness, and it was confirmed by them that it is an enormous sin, as well as that man becomes a brute, [and] no longer a man; because that man is a man lies in his intellectual faculty, thus he becomes a brute, besides which he brings damage on his body, and so hastens his death, besides wasting in extravagance what might be of use to many. - 1748, June 27. And it appeared to them so filthy that they abhorred such a life, which mortals nevertheless have introduced amongst themselves as a civil life. </p>
