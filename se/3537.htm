<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3537</h4><p>3537. About truths, and that circumstances extenuate<p>I spoke with spirits regarding the point of view that circumstances vary a situation, causing some to suppose that there is therefore no absolute truth either, for the reason that circumstances change a situation, and that Pilate said to the Lord, "What is truth?" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_38.htm">John 18:38</a>]. I was inspired to reply that all higher knowledge of faith consists of truths, and now I add, of eternal truths, and that every facet of the truth of faith is an eternal truth. But [I continued] while circumstances extenuate, they do not take away truths. For example, given that Adam was the first and only man, and his sons and daughters could be joined in marriage; this does not take away from the eternal truth that such marriages are unlawful.</p><p>[2] Then the fact that it is better to contract marriages at a youthful age than to keep a mistress is an eternal truth, but the fact that as societies are constituted today, marriages cannot be entered into before they are able to raise children, does not take away the truth.<p>About the Jews and the gentiles: it was said that Jewish young people not rightly instructed, due to their parents' persuasion, suppose that the Lord is not the Messiah, because circumstances exist that make the young people unable to believe it, but it does not take away the fact that for them the Lord is the promised Messiah.<p>Regarding the gentiles who are ignorant of the fact that the Lord rules the universe, because such ignorance is a circumstance, it does not take away the fact that they are saved, and instructed in the other life. There are many other examples as well. 1748, 11 Oct. Thus statements in the sense of the letter of the Word, that the Lord does evil things, kills, becomes angry; then that man does good, and many similar statements appearing in the Old Testament, do not take away the fact that the inward meaning is the truth. 1748. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3537</h4><p>3537. CONCERNING TRUTHS, AND THEIR BEING VARIED BY CIRCUMSTANCES<p>I spoke with spirits respecting the position, that the character of a thing is often varied by circumstances. They suppose that no absolute truth is given, and maintain that from the power of circumstances to alter the character of a fact, Pilate said to the Lord, "What is truth?" It was given to reply, that all the knowledges of faith are verities, that truths are eternal, and that whatever is of the truth of faith is an eternal truth; but that while circumstances may affect, they do not take away truths; as, for instance, let it be granted that Adam was the first and only man, and that his sons and daughters might be joined in marriage, yet this does not nullify the eternal truth that such marriages are unlawful. Again, let it be assumed that it is better to enter into marriage in the season of youth than to practice concubinage previously; this does not take away the truth, that as society is constituted, such marriages cannot be contracted before they are able to bring up children. So in regard to the Jews and Gentiles; [as for instance] concerning the Jewish children who, from the persuasion of their parents that the Lord is not the Messiah, are not instructed to believe it; yet as it is owing simply to circumstances that the children cannot believe otherwise than they do, this does not abolish with them the truth, that the Lord is the promised Messiah. And thus as to the Gentiles who are in ignorance, not knowing that the Lord rules the universe; this ignorance, being a circumstance, does not preclude their being instructed in the other life, and thus saved; besides many other things. - 1748, October 11. Thus the literal sense of the Word [implying] that the Lord does evil, that he slays, that he is angry; as also that man does good, and other similar things in the Old Testament, do not affect the position, that the interior sense is the truth. - 1748. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3537 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3537. De veritatibus, quod circumstantiae varient<p>Loquutus sum cum spiritibus, quod circumstantiae varient rem, quidam putant sic nullam dari certam veritatem, etiam ex ea ratiocinatione quod circumstantiae varient rem, tum quod Pilatus dixit ad Dominum, "quid veritas?" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3537/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_18_38" target=_top>Joh. XVIII: 38</a>] et dicere datum, quod omnes cognitiones fidei sint veritates, et nunc, quod veritates aeternae, et quodcunque est veritatis fidei, est veritas aeterna; at quod circumstantiae varient, non tollunt veritates, sicut, posito quod Adamus fuisset primus et unicus homo, quod ejus filii et filiae conjugia potuissent jungere, quod usque non tollit, quin veritas aeterna sit, quod talia conjugia non sint licita: tum quod melius sit tempore adolescentiae conjugia jungere, quam concubinas prius habere; est veritas aeterna, at quia societates tales sunt, ut non contrahi possint, antequam possunt liberos educare, quare istud non tollit veritatem; dictum est, de Judeis et gentibus, de judeis pueris non instructis ex persuasione parentum quod putent Dominum non esse Messiam, quia circumstantiae sunt, quod pueri non aliter credere possint, id non tollit apud eos, quin Dominus sit Messias promissus: de gentibus qui in ignorantia sunt, quod non sciant Dominum regere universum, quia ignorantia talis circumstantia est, non tollit, quin salventur, instructi in altera vita; praeter plura alia. 1748, 11 Oct. Ita sensus literalis Verbi, quod Dominus faciat mala, occidat, irascatur; tum quod bonum faciat homo: et plura similia, quae in Veteri Testamento, nec tollunt quin sensus interior sit veritas. 1748. </p>
