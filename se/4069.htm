<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4069</h4><p>4069. Those from the noble offspring of the most ancient Church spoke, saying that it was granted them to control the most deceitful ones, and that when deprived of their haughty spirit and pride, which keep them in their highest place, they then slip down, which was the cause of their weighing down my head with such gravity. At this those most deceitful ones could not open their mouths.<p>About themselves those offspring said that they indeed were also on high, but did not on this account have a haughty spirit, but that they had been allotted a place there by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4069</h4><p>4069. Those of the noble offspring of the Most Ancient Church spoke with me saying that it was given them to rule the most deceitful, and whenever they took away from them their elation and haughtiness of mind, which fully possessed them in their greatest elevation, they then sank downwards, which was the cause of their pressing with such a weight upon my head. These most deceitful, therefore, could not boast of having accomplished their ends. As to themselves, they said they also were in an elevated position, not because they were lofty minded, but because the Lord had there assigned them a place. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4069 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4069. Loquuti sunt ii a prole nobili Ecclesiae antiquissimae, quod datum iis regere dolosissimos, et cum demerent iis eorum elatum animum aut superbiam, quae eos tenet in altissimo suo, quod tunc delabantur, quae causa quod ita cum gravitate incumberent capiti; tunc nec dolosissimi hiscere potuerunt; de se quod quidem in altis quoque sint, sed non ideo quod elato animo, sed quod ibi sortiti a Domino locum. </p>
