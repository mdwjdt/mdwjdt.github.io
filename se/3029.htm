About the joy of happiness in heaven of those glorifying the Lord<p>Just now very many of the good were glorifying the Lord on account of His coming and their liberation from hell, and there was so great a joy of happiness that some were saying they could not endure it. 1748, 1 Sept. There was as it were a general glorification, so that even from some in hell there was also a desire to glorify, as I heard from certain ones who came from there, but from those who [dwell] in latrines. 1748, 1 Sept.<p>The next morning, all things were in a state of tranquility, so that I felt nothing but calmness, around me, silence, which still continues. 1748, 2 Sept. </p>
