<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3484</h4><p>3484. Therefore, so that I would not be held captive in those very last and most finite things, there was given me by the Lord a notion of forms that transcend geometric forms. For geometry terminates in a circle, and in curves that relate to a circle, which are only earthly, not even including the lowest atmospheric, not even aqueous forms. From those lowest or earthly forms, through removals of imperfections, such as those causing gravity, rest, cold, and so on, it was granted me to perceive in a most general way forms that did not labor with such imperfections.<p>Now there still remained forms that labored less, and some still less - so that there were finally forms in which one could find no trace of anything but a center in every point, so that it consisted of only center - seven all the peripheries of the circle, whose points all were nevertheless centers, and from the centers all looked to the same end.</p><p>[2] Therefore when the lowest form had been removed in which those boundaries stood, symbolizing the boundaries of space and of time, I finally saw myself transferred into forms almost devoid of boundaries, thus devoid of spaces and times. Yet all these forms are nevertheless finite, because an idea of them can be conceived through a certain removal of those things that are more finite, but they still remain finite. So all those forms are still within nature and are devoid of life; so also, as long as the mind sticks or is kept in those forms, it is still obviously without life; while the things within or above them, are living, from the Lord, but nevertheless organic, because they have nothing of life in themselves, just as the forms within nature.<p>One can never, therefore, by some kind of removal, have any conception of the forms within the earthly ones, as I now realize, having written about forms on this page [<a href="3482.htm">3482</a>] that within the most subtle ones of nature there are spiritual forms, completely beyond understanding. 1748, 5 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3484</h4><p>3484. Wherefore, that I might not be held in things so extremely ultimated and finite by the Lord, there was given me a notion of forms entirely transcending all geometrical forms, for geometry is terminated in the circle, or in curves referring themselves to the circle, which are merely terrestrial, and do not embrace even the lowest of the atmospheric and aqueous forms. From these lowest or terrestrial forms, it was given, by the removal of imperfections, such as the causes of gravity, rest, <sup>1</sup>cold, and so on, to perceive forms which were free from the operation of such causes; and that then there remained forms still more free from them, and others freer still, till at length forms were given in which nothing could be conceived but centers in every point, so that they consisted of mere centers from whence were all circles and peripheries, each of the points of which represented centers, and from these centers still had respect to similars, till the lower form being removed, in which were those termini signifying the boundaries of space and of time, I saw myself carried forward to forms almost entirely void of limits and thus taken out of relative to spaces and time. But all these forms are yet finite, because an idea of them can be conceived by a certain abstraction of those things that are more finited, though they yet remain finite; wherefore all such forms are still within nature, and are without life. Consequently as long as the mind detains itself or is detained in such forms, it still falls short of the sphere of life; but the things that are within or above them, are living from the Lord, but still organic, because even they have no life of themselves, any more than the forms within nature. Wherefore no one by any kind of abstraction can conceive of the forms that are within the natural, as I now perceive while writing concerning forms on the paper before me, being forced thus to confess that there are spiritual forms within the most subtle forms of nature which are never perceptible. - 1748, October 5.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;From this, and from what occurs elsewhere in the philosophy of Swedenborg, it appears that motion is to be regarded as a more native state of elementary matter than rest. -Tr. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3484 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3484. Quare ne tenerer in ultimis iis, et finitissimis, a Domino, data mihi notio est formarum quae transcendunt formas geometricas, nam geometria terminatur in circulo, et curvis, quae se ad circulum referunt, quae sunt modo terrestria, et ne hilum quidem atmospherica infima, ne quidem aquea: ex formis istis infimis seu terrestribus per remotiones imperfectionum, ut quae causantur gravitatem, quietem, frigus, et sic porro, datum communissime percipere formas quae talibus non laborarent: et quia usque remanebant, adhuc formas, quae minus laborarent, et sic quae adhuc minus, sic ut darentur tandem formae, in quibus non concipi posset nisi centrum in quocunque puncto, sic ut constaret ex meris centris, inde omnes circuli peripheriae, quarum omnia puncta usque centra referrent, et a centris respicerent jugiter similia: quare remota forma infima, in qua termini isti, significantes terminos spatii, et temporis, tandem viderem me, transferri in formas, quae fere absque terminis, ita absque spatiis et temporibus: sed omnes hae formae usque finitae sunt, quia earum idea concipi potest, per quandam amotionem eorum quae magis finita sunt, sed usque manent finita, quare omnes tales formae usque sunt intra naturam, et sunt absque vita, quare etiam quamdiu mens in talibus formis se detinet seu detinetur, [constat,] quod usque sit absque vita, at quae intra seu supra eas sunt, sunt viva, a Domino, sed usque organica, quia in se nihil vitae habent, sicut formae intra naturam; quare nusquam quis per remotionem quamcunque aliquem conceptum habere potest de formis quae intra naturales, sicut nunc percipio, cum de formis scripserim, in folio [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3484/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3482" target=_top>3482</a> seqq.], quod tandem fassus, quod intra subtilissimas naturae dentur formae spirituales, nusquam perceptibiles. 1748, 5 Oct. </p>
