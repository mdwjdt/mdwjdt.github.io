<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5824</h4><p>5824. Fallacies of the senses in spiritual matters: <p>1) That a person cannot appear as a person after death, nor be endowed with the senses as before, still less that angels and spirits can do so. <p>2) That the soul is only a vital something, purely ethereal, of which people can have no idea. <p>3) That it is only the body that feels and sees. <p>4) That man is similar to a beast, except that man can speak from thought, and that beasts are able to think in the same way. <p>5) That nature is the all and is the primary entity from which all things are derived. <p>6) That man absorbs and learns to think through the inflow of nature's inward element and its order. <p>7) That there is nothing spiritual, and if there is, it is a purer natural something. <p>8) That man cannot enjoy any blessedness when removed from the delights of the loves of glory, honor, gain, and the pleasures of the world. <p>9) That conscience is only a weakness of the spirit resulting from failures and weakness of the mind from a weakness of the body. <p>10) That the Lord's Divine Love is the love of glory. <p>11) That there is no Providence. <p>12) That all things flow from one's own prudence and intelligence, besides other [thoughts] like this. These [ideas] are held by the person who has greater self-love than others; and not so much by those who have a love for the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5824</h4><p>5824. Fallacies of the senses in spiritual things, are, <p>(1) that man cannot appear as man after death, nor enjoy the senses as before; still less that angels and spirits can. <p>(2) That the soul is only a vital something, purely ethereal, of which none can have any idea. <p>(3) That it is only the body which feels and sees. <p>(4) That man is like the beasts save that man is able to speak from his thought; also, that beasts are similarly able to think. <p>(5) That nature is all, and the first from which all things are. <p>(6) That man makes the attempt to think, and learns to do so, by an influx of interior nature and its order. <p>(7) That there is not a spiritual, and if there is, that it is a purer natural. <p>(8) That man is not able to enjoy any blessedness, when cut off from the delights of the love of glory, honor, gain and the pleasures of the world. <p>(9) That conscience is only distress of mind on account of non-success, and arises from infirmity of mind, resulting from infirmity of body. <p>(10) That the Lord's Divine Love is the love of glory. <p>(11) That there is no Providence. <p>(12) That all things flow from self-prudence and intelligence: besides other like things. In these is the man who is in the love of self above others: not so much so he who is in the love of the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5824 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5824. Fallaciae sensuum in spiritualibus,<p>1) Quod homo non possit apparere ut homo post mortem, nec gaudere sensibus sicut prius, minus quod angeli et spiritus.<p>2) Quod anima sit modo aliquid vitale, pure aethereum, cujus ideam non possunt habere.<p>3) Quod solum corpus sit quod sentit, videt.<p>4) Quod homo sit similis bestiae, modo quod homo possit loqui ex cogitatione, et quod bestiae similiter cogitare possint.<p>5) Quod natura sit omne et primum ex quo omnia.<p>6) Quod homo imbuat et discat cogitare per influxum interioris naturae et ejus ordinis.<p>7) Quod spirituale non sit, et si est, quod sit purius naturale.<p>8) Quod homo non possit frui aliqua beatitudine, ablatis jucundis amoris gloriae, honoris, lucri, et amaenis mundi.<p>9) Quod conscientia sit modo aegritudo animi ex non successibus, et ex infirmitate animi ex infirmitate corporis.<p>10) Quod Amor Divinus Domini sit amor gloriae.<p>11) Quod Providentia non sit.<p>12) quod ex propria prudentia et intelligentia omnia fluant, praeter alia similia. In his est homo qui in amore sui prae aliis, non tantum qui in amore mundi. </p>
