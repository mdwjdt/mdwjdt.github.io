<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2262</h4><p>2262. Most universal and universal meaning, kind, species, type, individual, least component<p>Within the meaning of the Lord's Word there are everywhere universal meanings, and most particular ones. They can be apparent from the following example:<p>The "nations," <sup>1</sup>when standing for those who are to be called to the Kingdom of the Lord, thus in a good sense, in the most universal meaning are all in the universe, the heavens and the earths, both those who are, and those who have been and are to come, on all planets in the universe.<p>In the universal meaning they are those on one planet, such as ours, in whatever country, who have been and are to come.<p>Of kinds there are as many as there are countries, or religious doctrines, and so on each planet.<p>Then of each kind, there are species, that is, each country or race has its various tribes, which may be many.<p>Particular types within each species are even more numerous.<p>These consist of individuals having their own way of understanding, and their own will.<p>The least components consist of each mental image and the least feeling pertaining to it, 1748, 9 June. These words [were written] in the presence of spirits, listening.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin is Gentes, which may also be translated "gentiles." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2262</h4><p>2262. THE MOST UNIVERSAL SENSE, THE UNIVERSAL [SENSE], GENUS, SPECIES, THE PARTICULAR, THE INDIVIDUAL, THE MOST SINGLE [singularissimum]. <p>In the sense of the Lord's Word are everywhere given universal and singular senses, which may be apparent from this example [the word] Gentiles [gentes]; when it stands for those who are to be brought into the Lord's kingdom, therefore in a good sense [it means] in the most universal sense, all in the universe, in the heavens and earths [terres], as well [those] who are [now], as those who have been, and those who are to come, in all worlds, in the universe; in the universal sense [it stands] for those [who are], have been, and are to come, in one world, as in ours, in every kingdom. The genera are more numerous; they are like kingdoms [or] doctrines, thus [those] in every world. Next are given species of these. In every kingdom, or every genus, are species, consequently they are very numerous. Particulars are still more numerous [belonging] to every species. Individuals [individua] belong to every man, as to his intellectuals and voluntary things; the most single [singularissima] belong to every idea and little affection [affectiunculae] of an idea. - 1748, June 9. These things [are written] in presence of spirits who hear [them]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2262 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2262. Sensus universalissimus, universalis, genus, species, particulare, individuum, singularissimum<p>In sensu Verbi Domini dantur ubivis sensus universales et singulares, qui constare possunt ab hoc exemplo: "Gentes," dum pro iis qui arcessendi ad Regnum Domini, ita in sensu bono, in sensu universalissimo sunt omnes in universo, in coelis et in terris, tam qui sunt, quam qui fuerunt et venturi, in omnibus telluribus, in universo. In sensu universali, [sunt] pro iis qui in una tellure, sicut in nostra, in quocunque regno, qui fuerunt et venturi. Genera sunt plura, sunt sicut sunt Regna, doctrinae, sic in quacunque tellure; species dantur dein eorum; in quocunque regno seu quocunque genere sunt species, ita perplures: particularia adhuc plura <sup>1</sup></p><p>, cujuscunque speciei, individua sunt cujusvis hominis, quoad ejus intellectualia <sup>2</sup></p><p>et voluntaria; singularissima sunt cujusvis ideae, et affectiunculae ideae, 1748, 9 Junius; haec <sup>3</sup></p><p>in praesentia spirituum audientium.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
