<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2428</h4><p>2428. A human on earth and a spirit understand nothing of deeper things on their own<p>From a spiritual mental image displayed as earlier [<a href="2423.htm">2423</a>] as very crude vessels into which spiritual and heavenly things were poured by the Lord - from that same mental picture I and the spirits were enabled to see that a human on earth and a spirit from such outward vessels as those, can never know, much less fathom, what is within, consequently what their inward qualities are. For vessels cannot know this from themselves, but when spiritual and heavenly qualities are slipped in by the Lord and those outer receiving vessels are put to the service of receiving them, so as to be as it were nothing in themselves or transparent (as in the spiritual mental image), then it is allowed them to know somewhat and to perceive what has been imparted, and its quality. 1748, 28 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2428</h4><p>2428. THAT MEN AND SPIRITS UNDERSTAND NOTHING [THAT IS] IN INTERIORS, FROM THEMSELVES. <p>[It was given to see] from a represented spiritual idea, as before, that they were as the rudest vessels, wherein the Lord infused spirituals and celestials; it was given me and spirits to see from the same idea that men and spirits from these exteriors, such vessels can never know anything, still less penetrate what is within, therefore [know] what and of what quality are their interiors, for vessels cannot know it from vessels; but when spirituals and celestials are insinuated by the Lord, and these external recipient vessels are fitted to receive, [they then can know] that they are, as it were, nothing, only [vessels] fitted [to receive], thus, as it were, pellucid vessels) (according to the spiritual idea). Then it is given to know and perceive in some manner what and of what quality is that which is insinuated. - 1748, June 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2428 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2428. Quod homo et spiritus nihil in interioribus intelligat ex se<p>Ex idea spirituali repraesentata, ut prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2428/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2423" target=_top>2423</a>], quod essent ut rudissima vasa, quibus a Domino infunderentur ea quae spiritualia coelestia essent, ex eadem idea videre mihi spiritibus dabatur, quod homo spiritus ab exterioribus istis, talibus vasis, nihil usquam scire minus penetrare possit, quid intus, proinde quae qualia interiora ejus <sup>1</sup></p><p>, nam vasa non id scire possunt ex vasis, sed cum a Domino insinuantur <sup>2</sup></p><p>spiritualia et coelestia, et vasa ista externa seu recipientia accommodata sunt ad recipiendum, ut quasi nihil sint, modo accommodata, sic quasi pellucida (secundum ideam spiritualem), tunc <sup>3</sup></p><p>scire aliquatenus et percipere datur, quid et quale id est, quod insinuatum. 1748, 28 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;nisi legeris<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
