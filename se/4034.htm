<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4034</h4><p>4034. I noticed just now, as I often had earlier, that evil spirits were under constraint to speak the things that were to be observed by me, although they do not know for what reason. Those mucus spirits are now also displeased that they should be speaking in this way, not knowing why, and that they were telling the things that were to be recorded by me, or to be observed as coming from them. At such a time there is also given a perception as to what is to be noted.<p>Therefore the evil spirits, as they have just declared, do not know where those things come from, some even wanting to abstain from speaking, lest something come of it. All of this showed that those things that I have learned by means of evil spirits, I have learned from the Lord Alone, even though spirits have spoken them. It was different when good spirits have spoken, at which time they have openly declared how the matter stands. 1748, 22 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4034</h4><p>4034. It was now observed, as previously remarked above, that evil spirits were constrained to utter the things that were to be noted [and recorded] by me, although ignorant of the reason of the constraint; on which account even those mucus-spirits became indignant that they should speak thus, not knowing that it was for such a purpose or that they spoke what I was to note down as coming from them. There was then given also a perception of what was to be observed, and yet evil spirits, as they have now said, know not whence it came, and are disposed to abstain from uttering certain things for the reason that they dislike that anything should be divulged concerning them, from all which it appeared, that even those things which I have learned by means of evil spirits, I have learned from the Lord alone, though the spirits spoke. It was otherwise when good spirits spoke; they declared openly how the truth was. - 1748, November 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4034 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4034. Observatum nunc, ut saepe prius, quod mali spiritus teneantur loqui ea, quae mihi observanda sunt, sed quod nesciant, quod ideo, indignati sunt nunc quoque muci isti, quod sic loquerentur, nescientes quod ideo et talia loquerentur, quae mihi observanda, seu ex iis observanda, datur tunc quoque perceptio, quid observandum, sic mali spiritus, sicut nunc dixerunt, nesciant unde illa veniant, quidam etiam abstinere voluerunt loqui, ex ea causa, ne inde aliquid: quibus constabat, quod illa, quae per malos spiritus quoque didici, a Solo Domino id didicerim, tametsi spiritus loquuti; aliter cum spiritus boni loquuti, tunc aperte dixerunt quomodo se res habeat. 1748, 22 Nov. </p>
