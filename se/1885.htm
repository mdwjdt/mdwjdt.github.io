<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1885</h4><p>1885. About Providence<p>I spoke with spirits about providence, some of whom maintain that it had been predestined that they had lived in the world as they did, and afterwards had undergone punishments as they did, as well as the fact that some are in lower circumstances than others. But the truth of the matter is that there is nothing that is not foreseen, that is, as to its outcome, because the person is of such or such a nature. It is also foreseen that if things were different, he would perish, and therefore it was provided that it would be permitted that the Lord would bend all things toward a universal purpose, thus toward the best outcome. This I learned also by actual experience. 1748, 10 April. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1885</h4><p>1885. CONCERNING PROVIDENCE. <p>Conversing with spirits concerning Providence some would have it that it was predestinated that they should live as they did in the world, and that afterwards they should undergo such punishments as they did, as also that some should be inferior to others. But the case is this, that nothing occurs but what is provided to happen just as it does, because man is of such a quality as he is, it being foreseen that if the case were otherwise he would perish; wherefore it is provided that that should be permitted, in order that the Lord might bend [everything] to a universal end, or to the greatest good. This also I have learned by lively experience. - 1748, April 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1885 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1885. De Providentia<p>Loquutus sum cum spiritibus de providentia, quidam volunt, quod ita sit praedestinatum, quod ita vixerint in mundo, et postea, quod tales poenas subeant, ut et quod quidam inferiores aliis sint: at res ita se habet, quod nihil non praevisum sit, quod nempe ita eveniet, quia talis homo est, praevisum etiam si aliter, quod periret, quare provisum, ut id permitteretur, quod Dominus flecteret ad finem universalem, seu ad optimum. Hoc quoque per vivam experientiam didici. 1748, 10 April. </p>
