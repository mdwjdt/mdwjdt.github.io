<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>458.在灵人的天堂有一个窒息我的阴谋形成，以及它似乎表示什么。<p>当我上床睡觉时，得到警告：一些灵人正在密谋反对我，目的是要杀了我；不过，我很安全，并不担心它，和对待他们的其它威胁一样，所以就去睡了。半夜醒来后，我觉得我不是在凭自己的力量呼吸，而是如我所相信的，是通过天堂呼吸；我明显感知这一点，以致呼吸不是我的。当时分明有人对我说，灵人的整个天堂都在密谋对付我，目的是让我窒息；就在他们设法执行其企图的那一刻，天堂的呼吸立即开始了；因此他们不得不放弃他们的企图。我被告知，那是灵人的整个天堂。那些在最前面的灵人的名字还被提及，只是不可以说出他们的名字；只有两个例外，他们代表仁爱和仁爱的果子；他们的确在场，但并不同意。然而，他们认为灵人的整个天堂都在他们一边，因为他们引诱每一个来到的人到他们那一边，声称他们说那些能进入天堂的人不能进入了，除非我先被杀死；因此，这一阴谋就形成了，但最终被挫败。这两个代表仁爱和仁爱果子的灵人退出了，事实上去到右边，而这个事件是在左边发生的。但当阴谋者受到惩罚时，他们被赶走并受到严厉的对待，除了他们的领袖之外，这些领袖凭天堂的命令而留下来。在我看来，这一切似乎表示当今被接受教义的内在元素正如此密谋反对他们所不愿信的圣言更内在和至内在的事物；不过，弥赛亚神维持这些更内在和至内在事物的生命。这生命由来自天堂的呼吸在我里面持续来表示，绝不是凭我自己，而是凭天堂，因而凭弥赛亚神，唯独祂是天堂。后来，一个似乎是他们旗手的人（尽管人们认为他不在场），试图进入我身体的内部器官，并渗透到心脏；在他的幻想中，他还以为他拥有心脏，以便攻击更内在的事物，或如他所说的，与它们行淫。（1748年1月8日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 458</h4><p>458. In the heaven of spirits a plot was formed to suffocate me, and what it seems to mean<p>When I was going to bed and about to sleep, warning was given that certain spirits were plotting against me with the intent to kill me; but because I was composed, not worrying about it any more than I did about their other threats, I fell asleep. In the night just after midnight, on waking up, I felt that I was not breathing on my own power, but, as I believed, from heaven, which I clearly perceived, so that the breathing was not mine. It was then clearly said to me that the whole heaven of spirits had plotted against me with the purpose of suffocating me, and that just at that moment, when they were trying to carry out their attempts, the heavenly breathing commenced, and so they had to give up on that try. I was told that it was the whole heaven of spirits. (The names of those who were at the forefront were also mentioned, but it is not permitted to name them, except for two, who portrayed charity and the fruits of charity. These were in fact present, but were not agreeing to it.)<p>Nevertheless, because they thought the whole heaven of spirits was on their side - for everyone who came, they allured over to their side by saying that those whom they claimed the power to let into heaven could not be admitted unless I were first killed - therefore that plot was formed, which ended up thwarted.<p>Those two who represented charity and the fruit of charity, withdrew, and in fact to the right side, while that incident occurred at the left side. But while the conspirators were being punished, they were driven off, except for their leaders, and treated harshly, while the leaders remained by command of the heavens.<p>This all seemed to me to signify that the inward elements of the accepted doctrine at the present day, were thus plotting against very inward and innermost things, to which they wanted to attach no belief; but that God the Messiah sustains the life of the very inward and innermost things. That life is symbolized by the breathing that was continued in me by heaven, in no wise by myself but by the heavens, consequently by God the Messiah, Who Alone is the Heavens.<p>Afterwards, one who seemed to be their standard-bearer, although he was not thought to be present, tried to enter the internal organs of my body and penetrate to the heart, which in his fantasies he still thinks he owns, so as to attack the more inward things, or, as he says, whore with them. 1748, the 8th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 458</h4><p>458. THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY MADE IN HEAVEN OF SPIRITS TO SUFFOCATE ME: AND WHAT IT SEEMED TO SIGNIFY <p>When I was in bed, about to go to sleep, it was foretold that certain spirits were conspiring against me with the purpose of killing me, but because I was secure, caring no more for that than for their other threats, I went to sleep. Having awakened about the middle of the night, I felt that I was not breathing of myself, but, as I believed, from heaven, which I manifestly perceived, so that the respiration was not mine. It was then plainly said to me, that the whole heaven of spirits had conspired against me with the purpose of suffocating me, and that as soon as they wanted to carry out their endeavors, the heavenly respiration at once came into existence, and so they had to desist from their attempt. It was said that it was the whole heaven of spirits. Who those were who presided over them were indeed mentioned by name, but it is not allowable to name them, with the exception of two, who represented charity and the fruit of charity who were indeed present but they did not consent. Nevertheless, they supposed that the whole heaven of spirits was of their party, because they allured those who came over to their side by claiming, that those whom they said they were able to admit into heaven could not be admitted, unless I was previously murdered; hence the conspiracy was made which, being in vain, ceased. Those two who represented charity and the fruit of charity receded, and indeed to the right; that conspiracy was made at the left. But when the conspirators suffered punishment they were then driven away and treated severely, except their leaders, who, by the command of the heavens, remained. It appeared to me that by this was signified that the interiors of the doctrine received at this day in this way conspired against the more interior and inmost things [of the Word], in which they were unwilling to have any faith; but that God Messiah sustains the life of these more interior and inmost things. This is what is signified by the respiration from heaven being continued in me - by no means from myself, but from the heavens, consequently, from God Messiah, Who alone is the heavens. <sup>1</sup>Afterwards their leader, as it seemed, although he was not thought to be present, tried to enter the viscera of my body and penetrate to the heart, which by phantasies he still supposes he possesses, that thus he may infest the more interior things, or, as he said, he wanted to commit whoredom with them. 1748, Jan. 8. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Or, "Who alone is [the God] of heaven." (Qui Solus est caeli.) </p>
