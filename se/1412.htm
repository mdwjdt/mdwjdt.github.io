<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1412</h4><p>1412. Later this veil was changed into a thicker one, like the (mattor giorda af sadant som Hollenska mattorna pa golfwet, derest jag vis ar <sup>1</sup>), a veil verging on yellow. Finally, when she still would not desist from her tenacity, she was completely rolled up in it, into quite a thick volume, which was thrown toward the back as if she were contemptible. But later, near me, she was rolled back in upright position, as if on a different axis, and then freed; for afterwards she spoke, and I noticed that she was compelling herself not to be like that, so this time she had been corrected to some extent.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "carpets made of the same material as Dutch carpets on the floor, if I am right." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1412</h4><p>1412. Moreover, this veil was changed into a coarser one, like (rugs made of such [material] as the Dutch rugs on the floor where I now am). <sup>1</sup>The veil was verging to a yellow color. And at length, since she would still not desist from her tenacity she was completely rolled up in this veil into quite a thick roll, which was projected toward the back of the body, as though she was being projected. But later, and near me, the roll was revolved vertically, as though on another axis. Then she was liberated; for she afterwards spoke with me, and I perceived that she forced herself not to be of such a nature. Thus she was for this time amended to some extent. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The words in parentheses were written in Swedish: (mattor giorda af sadant som Hollenska mattorna pa golfwet derest jag nu ar.) </p>
