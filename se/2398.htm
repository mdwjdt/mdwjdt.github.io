<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2398</h4><p>2398. Evil spirits are just like brute animals equipped with the power of reasoning, thus like rational brutes<p>At times I have told evil spirits, and have also thought, and they then read my thoughts, that they are only brutes - and of course rational brutes, in the sense that they possess the power of reasoning - but they are unable to exercise that power for good.<p>Therefore it is necessary that they should nevertheless be devoid of bodily memory such as they had during the life of the body, and that they should be kept in that state. For of themselves they dash into the worst things and are much viler than brute animals, because they are against order and hasten to corrupt order in themselves and in the community. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2398</h4><p>2398. THAT EVIL SPIRITS ARE ENTIRELY LIKE BRUTES THAT HAVE A FACULTY OF REASONING, THUS ARE, AS IT WERE, RATIONAL BRUTES. <p>I have sometimes said to evil spirits, and thus have also thought, they then perceiving my thoughts, that they are only brutes, and indeed rational in this sense, that they enjoy a reasoning faculty, but cannot exercise it for good; wherefore it is necessary that they be without a corporeal memory, such as they possessed in the life of the body, or that they be held in that state; for of themselves they rush into the worst things, and are viler than brute animals, because they rush contrary to order, and to pervert order in themselves, and in the common [sphere]. </p>

Quod mali spiritus sint prorsus sicut bruta, quibus facultas ratiocinandi, ita quasi bruta rationalia<p>Aliquoties ad malos spiritus dixi, et sic quoque cogitavi, ii tunc percipientes cogitationes, quod sint modo bruta, et quidem rationalia in eo sensu, quod facultate ratiocinandi gaudeant, sed nequeunt facultatem eam in bonum exercere, quare necessarium est, ut tamen sint absque memoria corporea, sicut in vita corporis, seu teneantur in eo statu, nam ex se ruunt in pessima, et sunt multo viliora brutis animantibus, quia contra ordinem, et ad pervertendum ordinem <sup>1</sup></p><p>in se et in communi ruunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ordine </p>
