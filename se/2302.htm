<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2302</h4><p>2302. There is no need to venerate any spirit<p>Spirits were told [this], because I realized by a spiritual mental image, that they are never to be venerated; for they constantly want it, insisting that they should be feared and that others including people on earth should venerate them. This is their greatest pursuit. But because their state of mind is continually changing, and they can neither think nor speak on their own power, nor recall any matter on their own, nor punish, nor reward, they are therefore not to be venerated. Only the Lord must be venerated, Who knows all and the least things, and rules the universal heaven and earth, Who rewards, and does what is good.<p>Angels, likewise, are not to be worshiped, much less adored, for the good they do is not theirs, but the Lord's, as all angels confess. Otherwise they are not angels. Yet honor is shown them, to the degree that they are the Lord's. 1748, 12 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2302</h4><p>2302. THAT THERE IS NO NEED OF REVERING ANY SPIRIT. <p>It was said by spirits, because perceived by a spiritual idea, that they should never be revered, for they continually desire and insist upon it that they may be feared, and others and men revere them, for it is their greatest desire [studiumn]; but inasmuch as their state is continually changed, they cannot think nor speak of themselves, nor remember anything of themselves, nor punish, nor reward; therefore they should not be revered. The Lord alone is to be revered, who knows each and all things, and rules the universal heaven and earth, [and] rewards and makes good. Angels likewise are not to be worshipped, still less adored, for the good they do is not theirs, but the Lord's, which all the angels confess; otherwise they are not angels: yet honor is done them so far as they are the Lord's. - 1748, June 12. </p>

Quod non opus sit ullum spiritum vereri<p>Dictum spiritibus, quia perceptum idea spirituali, quod nusquam verendi sunt, ii enim jugiter id cupiunt et insistunt, ut timeantur, et eos vereantur alii, et homines, id eorum <sup>1</sup></p><p>maximum studium; sed quia eorum status continue mutatur, nec possunt cogitare, nec loqui a se, nec reminisci cujusvis rei a se, nec <sup>2</sup></p><p>punire nec remunerare, proinde non verendi; Solus Dominus verendus, Qui omnia et singula novit, et universum coelum et terram regit, remunerat, et bonum facit.<p>Angeli similiter, non colendi, minus adorandi, nam bonum quod faciunt, non est eorum, sed Domini, quod omnes angeli fatentur, alioquin non sunt angeli, iis usque honor fit, quatenus Domini sunt. 1748, 12 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
