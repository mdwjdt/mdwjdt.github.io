<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1312</h4><p>1312. If truths are taken as premises or principles, then countless confirmatory truths are discovered<p>It is known that whatever theory a person embraces as a principle, or as a leading truth, many seemingly true confirmations join with it. In this way falsities are finally born, very many from one. But if a truth is taken as a premise, there is nothing that does not confirm it.<p>Take, for example, what I proposed to spirits: When the truth is accepted that a spirit does not possess the kind of memory that man has, thus does not know what is past and gone, then, because this has been Divinely ordained and established, innumerable affirming truths join with it. For thus his highest happiness is realized, and otherwise no happiness, and no heaven, and everyone would be made anxious by things past, about things to come. He would long for them, and every day be depressed by worries, as those on earth are. Then he would trust in himself, not letting himself to be ruled by the Lord, and [be influenced by] countless other factors contrary to a condition of happiness. Therefore the Lord commanded that man should not be depressed by such cares, by worrying about the morrow [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_34.htm">Matt 6:34</a>] <sup>1</sup>. 1748, 12 March.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Printed version has 4:34, which is an error. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1312</h4><p>1312. IF VERITIES BE ASSUMED AS A THESIS OR PRINCIPLE, INNUMERABLE VERITIES ARE THEN DISCOVERED AND ALL THINGS CONFIRM <p>It is well known that whatever thesis or thought a man takes as a principle or as the truth of a proposition, very many confirming things which resemble truths are added; in this way very many falsities are at length born from one. But if a verity is taken as a thesis, there is then nothing which does not confirm. Take the following, which I proposed to spirits, as an example: When it is assumed as a verity that a spirit does not enjoy such a memory as man has, so that he does not know what has happened in the past, then, because this is Divinely ordered and instituted, innumerable affirming truths are added therefrom as that in this way a spirit has his greatest happiness and otherwise there would be neither any happiness nor any heaven, for then every one from the past would be anxious concerning the future, he would be filled with desires and be worried with daily cares, as man is. Thus he would trust in himself, and would not suffer himself to be governed by the Lord, besides innumerable other things which are contrary to a state of happiness. Therefore the Lord commanded that man should not be concerned with such cares in thinking about the morrow [Matthew <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_34.htm">xi 34</a>. 1748, Mar. 12. </p>
