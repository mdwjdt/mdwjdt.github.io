<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2391</h4><p>2391. About those who only study the literal meaning of the Lord's Word, and collect passages from it<p>Some were with me of those who had collected passages from the literal meaning of the Lord's Word. While I was collecting passages in the Lord's Word and at the same time directing my mind to their inward meaning, they were attending only to the meaning of the letter. And I can confess, there was such darkness, and there was such repugnance, so to speak, and strain, it was like walking in deep sand and having to lift up the feet each step. When I wanted to lift my mind, they pulled me back, so that it was extremely tiring both for them and for myself, for it was a labor that wearied both parties.<p>This prompts me to infer how those will be who cling only to the letter and study it, when they are about to hear the inward parts of the Word: there will be constant repugnance, and constant laboring, besides the pleasure they take in the letters, as in scattered sand, where they like to walk, not longing to elevate themselves toward inward regions. It also shows with what difficulty they are lifted up in the other life toward inward regions and toward heaven. For in the other life, the letter and literal meaning is nothing, and must be blotted out, just as the body must be with respect to the soul, before they can be lifted up toward heaven. 1748, 23 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2391</h4><p>2391. CONCERNING THOSE WHO ONLY STUDY THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE LORD'S WORD, AND HENCE MAKE COLLECTIONS. <p>There were with me certain of those who collected those things that belonged only to the sense of the letter in the Lord's Word. When I collected those things which were in the Lord's Word, and then at the same time attended to the interior sense, they only [studied] the sense of the letter, and I must acknowledge that there was such obscurity and such repugnance, as it were, and labor, as is usual when anyone walks [vadit] in deep sand, needs raise his feet at every step. They drew back, when I wished to elevate my mind, so that it was very irksome both to them and to me; for it was a labor which fatigued both parties. Hence it is given to conclude how they will be who inhere only in letters, and study them, when they should give ear to the interiors of the Word, [and] that there is a continual repugnance and continual labor, besides which they delight in letters, as in the strewn sand, and desire to walk there, and do not want to be elevated towards interiors. Hence also it must be evident what sort of difficulty they have in the other life, to be elevated towards interiors and heaven: for in the other life letters and the literal sense of the Word is nothing, but they are destroyed like the body of the soul, before they can be elevated towards heaven. - 1748, June 23. </p>

De iis, qui solum sensui literae Verbi Domini student, et collectiones inde faciunt<p>Erant apud me quidam ex iis qui collegerunt ea quae essent sensus literae solum in Verbo Domini, dum ego colligerem ea quae in Verbo Domini essent, et simul tunc intenderem sensui interiori, ii solum sensui literae; et fateri possum, quod talis obscuritas, et talis esset repugnantia quasi, et labor, sicut, ut solet, dum quis vadit in arena profunda, et elevare debeat singulis passibus pedes: retrahebant, cum vellem mentem elevare, sic ut taediosum maxime esset, et iis et mihi, nam labor erat, qui fatigabat utrumque; exinde concludere datur, quomodo futuri ii, qui solum literis inhaerent, et iis student, dum interiora Verbi audituri, quod continua repugnantia, et continuus labor, praeter quod delectentur in literis, sicut in arena sparsa, ibique vadere cupiunt, nec elevari se versus interiora desiderant: exinde etiam constare potest, qualis difficultas <sup>1</sup></p><p>iis in altera vita, ut eleventur versus interiora et coelum, nam in altera vita literae et literalis sensus Verbi, nihil est, sed delendus, sicut corpus animae {a}, antequam versus coelum elevari possint. 1748, 23 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has diffulcultas </p>
