<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2880</h4><p>2880. Evil spirits could not live if they did not serve for temptations, punishments, and the like, from which good results<p>It is clear that the life of evil spirits consists in thinking and doing evils, for in this they find the enjoyment of their life. Whatever belongs to their love belongs to their life, so that if they were compelled and held forcibly to [doing] good, then not only could they not live, but neither could they be reformed, that is, bent to good. So they are permitted to serve in such ways, so that the evil may undergo correction, as by punishments, purgings, temptations.<p>That they cannot live without such activities, and that their life would be taken away if their wicked practices were taken away, I have been inspired to tell them several times, nor could they deny it, but they affirm it. For example even today, they also feel comfort from hope: for while they are plotting and wanting to do something fraudulent, and cherish the hope of doing evil, then they have consolation, and grow calm. This was shown to me today, so they, too, have a restful life due to hope. 1748, 22 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2880</h4><p>2880. THAT EVIL SPIRITS COULD NOT HAVE LIVED, UNLESS THEY MIGHT SERVE FOR TEMPTATIONS, PUNISHMENTS, AND THE LIKE, FROM WHICH GOOD ARISES. <p>Inasmuch as the life of evil spirits consists in thinking and doing evil, for in these they place pleasantness of life, whatever belongs to their love belongs to their life, therefore were they checked in those things, and held forcibly to good, then not only could they not live, but also could not be reformed, that is, bended to good. Wherefore it is permitted them; that to serve for such [things] for the end that the evil may be emended, for instance through punishments, vastations, temptations. That they could not live apart from such [things], and that life would be taken away from them, were their malicious practices taken away, it was granted to tell them several times, and they could not deny, but affirm [it]. In like manner this day also, that they also have their consolation [derived] from hope, to wit when they intend any fraud, and desire and have hope, of doing evil, then they have consolation and are quiet; which was also shown me today. Wherefore they also possess a quiet life, [derived] from hope. - 1748, August 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2880 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2880. Quod mali spiritus non potuissent vivere <sup>1</sup></p><p>, nisi inservirent tentationibus, poenis, et similibus, ex quibus bonum<p>Quod vita malorum spirituum consistat in cogitando agendoque mala <sup>2</sup></p><p>, [constat,] nam in iis jucunditatem vitae ponunt, quicquid amoris eorum est, est vitae eorum, quare si coercerentur in iis, et tenerentur ad bonum coacte, tunc <sup>3</sup></p><p>non solum non vivere possent, sed etiam nec ii reformari hoc est flecti in bonum; quare permittitur iis, ut inserviant talibus, ob finem, ut mali emendentur, sicut per poenas, vastationes, tentationes: quod vivere non possint absque talibus, et quod adimeretur iis vita, si adimerentur malitiae eorum, iis aliquoties dicere datum est, nec negare potuerunt, sed affirmant; sicut etiam hodie, quod ii quoque suum solatium habeant a spe, nempe cum aliquid fraudis intendunt, et cupiunt, et spem habent malum faciendi, tunc solatium habent, et quiescunt, quod hodie mihi ostensum est, quare vitam quoque quietam ex spe habent. 1748, 22 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;stilo B.
