<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2683</h4><p>2683. About those who constitute the region of the foot-sole<p>These you may see discussed earlier [<a href="2678.htm">2678-2679</a>]. They are of an upright kind who during their bodily life had lived for worldly enjoyment, delighting in the things of the world, loving to live lavishly, but doing so only from an outer, bodily craving. They take pleasure in an attractive table and such things, and still they are upright, not of a haughty spirit, putting themselves above others, even if they are in a position of dignity, even if they are kings.<p>For they are responding only to the body, not the inward mind, nor do they reject, still less deny, the teachings regarding faith in the Lord. They just do not concern themselves so much with them, because the life of the world draws them, saying in their heart, it may be as they tell us. And they can even pray and make supplication humbly without self-induced darkness-in such people the way to heaven lies open. In short, compassion, charity, uprightness, piety, righteousness, are inseminated by the Lord within them, even though others who trust in themselves and imagine themselves to be most keenly intelligent regard them as simple and worthless when it comes to deeper matters. 1748, 25 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2683</h4><p>2683. CONCERNING THOSE WHO CONSTITUTE THE REGION OF THE FOOT. <p>Concerning these see above. Such are [those] who [are upright], who in the life of the body have lived for the world an inclination [genio], delighted in those things, which belong to the world, loved to live splendidly, but only from an external cupidity, or [that] of the body, delight in a splendid table, and the like, and yet nevertheless are upright, not boasting in mind [animo] by preferring themselves to others, although they are in dignity, although they might be Kings: do not care so much [for them] because the life of the world delights them - they say in their hearts, that it may be so, as also they say [with the mouth]: yea also free from the darkness brought on themselves, can pray and supplicate in an humble manner. In such, the way to heaven is open: In a word, inwardly is inseminated by the Lord, mercy, charity, probity, piety, justice, although others who trust in themselves, and suppose they are most subtly prudent, regard these as simple and of no account [pretii] as to interiors. - 1748, July 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2683 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2683. De iis, qui plantae pedis regionem constituunt<p>De iis vide prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2683/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2678" target=_top>2678-2679</a>]; sunt tales, qui probi, qui in vita corporis vixerunt mundo et genio, delectati in iis quae sunt mundi, amantes vivere splendide, sed modo ex cupiditate externa seu corporis, qui delectantur mensa splendida, et similibus, et usque tamen probi sunt, non superbientes animo, se aliis praeferendo, tametsi in dignitate sunt, etiamsi essent reges; nam ex solo corpore agunt, non ex mente interiori, tales non rejiciunt, minus negant doctrinalia fidei in Dominum, sed modo non curant tantum, quia vita mundi eos oblectat, corde suo dicentes, quod ita possit esse, sicut dicunt {a}, imo etiam absque tenebris sibi inductis, possunt humiliter orare et supplicare: in talibus aperta est via ad coelum; verbo intus a Domino inseminatur misericordia, charitas, probitas, pietas, justitia, tametsi alii <sup>1</sup></p><p>qui sibi fidunt, et putant se acutissime prudentes esse, aestimant eos ut simplices et nullius pretii quoad interiora. 1748, 25 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has aliis </p>
