<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第210节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>210.关于由弥赛亚神国度中的那些事物所产生的普遍气场。没有什么比被告知以下事实更令人惊奇和难以置信的：有些普遍气场可以说由构成弥赛亚神国度的事物发出，对应于人类心智中的事物，无论更内在的还是内在的，它们都在弥赛亚神的国度。这些气场无法描述，不过，对它们的观念可通过某些对比来说明。一般来说，气场既有属天的，也有属灵的；既有高级的，也有低级的。只要恶灵被允许住在最低级的气场，该气场就被毁灭。然而，它甚至上升到理性气场那里，并干扰它。今天，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，我以这种方式被置于理性气场，即：我的推理部分与该气场和谐一致，所以它没有像其它时候那样被干扰。这时，在该气场的灵人却感到压抑、遭受痛苦，声称他们无法在里面存活，就像空中的鸟儿没有空气，只有以太，或像空气中的鱼儿，他们想要逃离。我由此知道，当弥赛亚神的国度到来时，恶灵必被赶出去，因为他们在该气场几乎不能呼吸；当我祷告，尤其念诵主祷文时，就被接入这气场，于是我得以清楚发觉祷告的更内在的内容。所有属天和属灵的气场都关注弥赛亚神的国度，因为它们来自弥赛亚神，祂是神的国。由此可知，必须有一个普遍气场，以便有个体气场；因为这些个体气场若不在一个普遍气场里面，就无法存在；所有个体事物都与总体事物有关，总体事物反过来引导个体事物，最终把它们引入总体所在的次序。否则，个体元素必从总体元素那里被逐出。这些都是哲学界所知并普遍有效的规则。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 210</h4><p>210. About general fields arising from everything in the Kingdom of God the Messiah<p>Nothing more amazing and unbelievable can be told than that there are seemingly general realms or fields of those properties which constitute God the Messiah's Kingdom, that interact with those in human minds, both the more inward and the inward, which are in the Kingdom of God the Messiah. These fields cannot be described, but the matter could be illustrated by a comparison.<p>In general, there are higher and lower heavenly, as well as spiritual, fields. The lowest realm has been ruined as long as it is allowed for evil spirits to inhabit it, and this field still rises up even to the rational realm, and disturbs it.<p>Today, by the mercy of God the Messiah, I was placed in that rational field in such a way that the reasoning part of me was in harmony with that realm, which was therefore not disturbed as at other times. Then the spirits in it felt oppressed, saying that they could not live in it, as a bird in an atmosphere where there is no air, but [only] ether, or as a fish in air, but wanted to flee away. This tells me that when the Kingdom of God the Messiah comes, then evil spirits are necessarily cast out, for they are almost unable to draw breath in it, as just said. 1747, 20 October (old calendar).<p>When I was praying, especially the Lord's prayer, I was received into that realm, which enabled me to view the more inward content of that prayer.<p>All those heavenly and spiritual realms look to the Kingdom of God the Messiah, because they are from God the Messiah, Who is the Kingdom of God. It follows from all this that there must surely be a general realm, in order for there to be individual ones, which cannot exist except in community; and that all individual things relate back to collective ones, which in turn guide the individual ones - ultimately into the order they themselves are in. Otherwise individual elements must necessarily be cast out of the community. These are rules known to Philosophy, and universally valid. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 210</h4><p>210. CONCERNING THE GENERAL SPHERES ARISING FROM THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD MESSIAH <p>Nothing can be said to be more wonderful and incredible than that there are general spheres, as it were, of the things which are of the Kingdom of God Messiah, corresponding to the things in human minds, both the more interior and the interior which are in the Kingdom of God Messiah. These spheres cannot be described, but an idea of them can be presented by some comparison. The spheres in general are celestial, also spiritual, higher and lower. The lowest is destroyed so long as evil spirits are permitted to dwell therein this sphere, as yet, ascend even to the rational sphere, and disturbs it. Today, by the mercy of God Messiah, I was present in the rational sphere in such a way that any rational might be in agreement with that sphere, and so it was not disturbed, as it otherwise would have been. The spirits who were in that sphere then suffered anguish, and said they could not live in it; it was as if a bird were in a sphere where there was no air, but ether, or as a fish in the air, and they wanted to flee away. From this I could know that when the Kingdom of God Messiah comes, evil spirits are then of necessity expelled, for they are, as it were, unable to breathe in that sphere as was said. 1747, Oct. 20, o.s. When I was praying, especially when praying the Lord's Prayer, I have been received into that sphere, and then it was given me to perceive clearly the more interior things of the prayer. <p>[210a] All those celestial and spiritual spheres have regard to the Kingdom of God Messiah, because they are from God Messiah, Who is the Kingdom of God. From these things it can be concluded that there must assuredly be a general sphere in order that there may be particular ones, which could not exist unless they were within a general: and that all the particulars refer themselves to the generals, and the generals direct the particulars, and at length direct them into that order in which the generals are; otherwise they would of necessity be expelled from the general. These are rules with which philosophy is acquainted, and which govern in the universe. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 210 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>210. De sphaeris communibus oriundis ab iis quae sunt Regni Dei Messiae<p>Nihil mirabilius et incredibilius potest dici, quam quod sint quasi sphaerae communes eorum quae sunt Regni Dei Messiae, quae correspondent iis in mentibus humanis, tam intimiori quam interiori, quae sunt in Regno Dei Messiae hae sphaerae describi non possunt, sed per aliquam comparationem potuisset sisti: sunt sphaerae in genere coelestes, tum spirituales, superiores et inferiores, infima destructa est, quamdiu malis spiritibus permissum est eam inhabitare, quae sphaera adhuc ascendit usque ad sphaeram rationalem, et eam perturbat; hodie per Dei Messiae misericordiam sistebar in sphaera rationali, sic ut rationale apud me concordaret cum ista sphaera, nec sic perturbaretur, ut alioquin, tunc spiritus qui inibi erant angebantur, dicebantque quod non vivere inibi possent, tanquam avis [in] <sup>1</sup></p><p>sphaera ubi non aer, sed aether <sup>2</sup></p><p>, aut sicut piscis in aere, sed volebant aufugere; ex iis scire possum, quod, quum Regnum Dei Messiae venit, quod tunc mali spiritus necessario expellantur, nam inibi quasi animam trahere nequeunt, ut dictum est. 1747, 20 Oct. st. v.<p>Quando orarem, cumprimis orationem Dominicam, in eam sphaeram receptus sum, et tunc intimiora orationis perspicere mihi dabatur. Sphaerae istae omnes coelestes et spirituales spectant Regnum Dei Messiae, quia sunt a Deo Messia, Qui est Regnum Dei. Ex his deduci potest, quod omnino sphaera communis dari debeat, ut sint particularia, quae non dari queant nisi in communi, et quod omnia <sup>3</sup></p><p>particularia referant se ad communia, et communia dirigant particularia, et tandem in eum ordinem in quo sunt communia, alioquin necessario expelluntur a communi--hae <sup>4</sup></p><p>sunt regulae, quas Philosophia novit, et quae regnant in universo.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
