<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1289</h4><p>1289. About a vampire<p>There was a certain one, so spirits told, who when he died, they told, had thought about vampires and was obsessed with the insane wish, if he should die, to do the same [as they] and thus be raised up by the life [in blood]. He was with me and was trying the same thing where the larger veins flow down along the neck and dorsal spine. But because no evil can befall me, the attempt was in vain.<p>This happened, they said, because in the hour of death he had thought about sucking blood, and this thought returned to him when he found out that he was with a person living in the body. 1748, 10 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1289</h4><p>1289. CONCERNING A CERTAIN VAMPIRE <p>As it was related by spirits, a certain person when he was dying was said to have been thinking about vampires, and was then excited with the insane lust, that if he died he would act likewise, and in this way would be raised again from the life [of the body]. He was with me and endeavored to do this where the larger veins flow down near the neck and dorsal spine, but because no evil can happen to me the effort was in vain. This was said to have happened, because in the hour of his death he thought of such a suction, and this thought returned to him when he knew he was with a man living in the body. 1748, Mar. 10. </p>
