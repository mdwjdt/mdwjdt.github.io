<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4955</h4><p>4955. They were seen several times. And then when this happens, an aura as if it were of the Lord, produced from their fantasy, appears around them, and they virtually want to be adored as the Lord. They were indignant when I merely looked at them. But then angered, they talked it over among themselves; and after this they were driven off the mountain by a back way and, because they were evil, cast into hell. This happened several times. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4955</h4><p>4955. They were seen several times; and, when seen, there appears around them, from phantasy, a sphere as if it were the Lord's; and they wish to be adored almost like the Lord. They were indignant when I looked at them; but then, being angry, they consulted together; and, afterwards, they were driven off by a back way from the mountain, and, as they were evil, they were cast into hell. Thus it happened on several occasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4955 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4955. Visi aliquoties, et tunc apparet ex phantasia sphaera quasi Domini circum illos, et volunt paene adorari ut Dominus, indignati sunt cum modo aspiciebam illos, sed tunc irati, consultabant inter se, et dein abacti per viam posteriorem e monte, et quia mali, conjecti in infernum; ita factum aliquoties. </p>
