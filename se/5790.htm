<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5790</h4><p>5790. All those were the sort of spirits that took away the government of the Lord from everyone they met, for they claimed it to themselves and reached the point of believing themselves to be gods and that the Divine is nothing else than that the Lord rules the whole and they the details, thus that they are gods and this is heaven. To exercise control is, they say, heaven, because this is the very delight of their life. They never defer to the Lord, nor receive anything obediently; they want to do everything of themselves.<p>[5790] 1.2. Those who are not like this are satisfied with their dwellings, are content with their own, and do the duties asked of them. These are those who enjoy heavenly joy, because it is in them, not outside them. I spoke with certain spirits like this, and I said that if they wanted to govern others and the objects before their eyes, it would as if one fiber in the body wanted to claim everything of the will to itself and did not want to obey the will except of itself, and if many fibers were to do so, all action would entirely cease. It would not receive the inflow of the will but would separate itself [from it] and utterly destroy everything below. Because these [truths] came down into the ideas of the spirits, they acknowledged that it was so. But still they did not desist, because love is what drives each spirit there, and it is futile to change it, for it is from it that he or she is a person, or spirit, spirits are nothing but their own love.<p>[5790] 1.3. Most spirits like this are hypocrites. As long as they are able to exercise control, they acknowledge the Divine, but as soon as they are deprived of control they deny it. This [denial] is what they have in their hearts; the acknowledgement they have only in their mouths. That people in the world are also like this is a known fact, especially among the Catholic community. They worship the Lord with their mouth and regard Him as so holy that at the host's mere presence when it is borne around and when its emblem is displayed from the altar, they make all fall upon their knees and worship Him most holily, when in fact at heart they deny Him, saying that the Lord has no power because all power has been given to them, thus that the Lord rules from them. How a certain one was lifted up from hell was also shown, and there power over many was given to him and it was said [to him] that he would have the use and enjoyment of this power if he acknowledged the Lord. He then acknowledged the Lord with such fervor that another could scarcely have done more so. But as soon as he was deprived of dominion, he denied. Such are all </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5790</h4><p>5790. All these are of such a quality, that they take away the government of the Lord from every one whom they assail; for they arrogate it to themselves, and rise up even to the point that they believe that they are gods, and that the Divine is not anything, but that the Lord rules universally and they in details; thus, that they are deities, and that this is heaven. They say that ruling is heaven, because this is the very delight of their life. They therefore never submit to the Lord, nor receive anything of obedience: they wish to do all things from proprium. <p>5790a. Those who are not such keep quiet in their own houses. They are content with their own possessions, and perform the duties enjoined upon them. These are the ones who enjoy heavenly gladness, because it is in themselves and not outside them. I spoke with some who were such, and said that if they wished to rule others, and over subject-spirits, by their eyes, it would be as if one fiber in the body wished to arrogate to itself all things of the will, and not to obey the will save from itself, and that if many fibers did thus, all action would stand still utterly, would not receive the influx of the will, but would separate itself and utterly destroy lower things. Inasmuch as these [observations] fell into the ideas of the spirits, they acknowledged that it was so; but still they did not desist; for the love is what actuates every one there, and it is vain to try to change it; for a man, or spirit, is from it, and is nothing else than his love. <p>5790b. The majority of such ones are hypocrites. As long as they are able to rule, they acknowledge the Divine; but as soon as they are deprived of dominion, they deny it. They carry this [denial] in the heart: the acknowledgment they carry only in the mouth. It is well known that there are such also in the world, especially among the Catholic community. They adore the Lord with the mouth, and affect sanctity to such a degree that merely at the presence of the host when it is borne round, and when they exhibit that symbol from the altar, they compel all to fall upon their knees and to be in the holiest worship of Him; when, nevertheless, in their heart, they deny Him, even saying that the Lord has no power, because it has all been given to themselves: thus, that the Lord rules by virtue of them. It was shown, also, that a certain one was taken up out of hell, and power was there given him over many; and it was said that he would enjoy that power if he acknowledged the Lord: and then he acknowledged with such great fervor as scarcely anyone could exceed; but, as soon as he was deprived of dominion, he denied Him. Of such a character are all those who adore the Divine for the sake of dominion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5790 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5790. Omnes illi tales sunt, ut auferant unicuique, quem offendunt, regimen Domini, nam vindicant id sibi, et scandunt usque eo, quod credant se deos esse, et quod Divinum non aliud sit, quam quod Dominus regat universaliter et illi singulariter, sic quod dii sint, et quod hoc sit coelum, dominari dicunt esse coelum, quia id ipsum jucundum vitae eorum est; ideo nusquam obtemperant Domino, nec recipiunt quicquam obedientia, ex proprio volunt omnia facere,<p>[5[790] 1/2. qui non tales sunt, illi acquiescunt in suis domibus, contenti suis sunt faciunt functiones sibi injunctas, illi sunt qui fruuntur gaudio coelesti, quia in ipsis non extra illos; loquutus sum cum quibusdam talibus dicebam quod si illi vellent regere alios subjectos oculis eorum, quod foret sicut una fibra in corpore vellet arrogare sibi omnia voluntatis non obedire voluntati, nisi ex se si plures fibrae ita facerent, quod omnino omnis actio subsisteret, non reciperet voluntatis influxum, sed separaret se prorsus destrueret omnia inferiora, haec quia cadebant in ideas spirituum, agnoscebant quod ita esset: sed usque non desistebant, nam amor est qui agit unumquemvis ibi incassum est illum mutare, nam est inde homo seu spiritus, qui non est nisi quam suus amor. <p>[5[790] 1/3. Plerique ex talibus sunt hypocritae, quamdiu dominari possunt, agnoscunt Divinum, sed ut primum privantur dominio, negant id, hoc corde ferunt, quod agnoscant modo ore ferunt: quod tales etiam sint homines in mundo notum est, imprimis apud Catholicam gentem, adorant Dominum ore tam sanctum faciunt, ut modo praesentiam illius cum circumfertur hostia cum insigne id ex altari ostendunt, quod omnes super genua labi cogantur in sanctissimo Ipsius cultu esse, cum tamen corde suo negant illum, dicentes etiam quod Domino nulla potestas, quia omnis sibi data est; sic ut Dominus regat ex illis; ostensum etiam quod quidam ex inferno sublatus sit ibi data est ei potestas super plures dictum quod illa potestate frueretur si agnosceret Dominum tunc tanto fervore agnovit, ut vix magis alius, sed utprimum privatus est dominio, negavit: tales sunt omnes </p>
