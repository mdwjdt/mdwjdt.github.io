<p>376.恶魔般的灵人通过他们的幻觉不仅给彼此，还给世人带来极其强烈的痛苦和折磨感。出于许多原因，我可以断言，灵魂和灵人只通过幻觉不仅能给彼此，还能给世人带来痛苦折磨。没有人会相信这一点，尽管它如此地真实，以致我不仅能通过大量且频繁的亲身经历，还能通过正遭受折磨的灵魂和灵人的经历，以及灵魂通过类似幻觉所体验到的强烈感觉（他们对这种感觉最为肯定）充分证明这一事实。因为在灵魂里面所产生的每种感觉都是一种肉体感觉，如视觉、嗅觉、触觉、听觉，甚至情欲和食欲，并且如此强烈，以致它们几乎如同在肉体本身中那样强烈。因此，这也适用于疼痛感。若非弥赛亚神将灵魂从这种地狱中拯救出来，魔鬼团伙就会带来这些最可怕的疼痛。（1747年12月21日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 376</h4><p>376. Diabolic spirits, by their fantasies, bring not only upon each other, but also upon people on earth, very strongly felt pains and torments<p>For many reasons I can assert that souls and spirits, by mere fantasies, were able to bring painful torments not only upon each other, but even upon people on earth. No one may ever believe this, but still it is so true that I can fully affirm it from experience not only in myself - indeed, quite much and frequent experience - but also from [that of] souls and spirits when they were being tormented, as well as from the strong sensation the souls [experienced] from fantasies like these - which they affirm most emphatically. For every kind of sense is produced in souls as if it were a physical one, such as sight, smell, taste, hearing, yes even desires and appetites - so strong, that they hardly occur in the body so strongly.<p>So this applies also to sensations of pain. Most violent ones would be brought on by the diabolic gang, if God the Messiah did not save souls from such a hell. 1747, the 21st day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 376</h4><p>376. THAT DIABOLIC SPIRITS BY THEIR PHANTASIES BRING NOT ONLY UPON THEMSELVES, BUT ALSO UPON MEN, MOST SENSIBLY FELT TORMENTS AND TORTURES <p>From many things I can declare that souls and spirits from phantasies alone were able to bring upon themselves, and also upon men, painful torments which no one could ever believe, although it is nevertheless so true that I can fully testify to the fact, not only from experience sufficiently abundant and frequent in myself, but also from the souls and spirits when they were being tortured; also from the sensibility of souls through similar phantasies, as is most fully testified. For with souls any sense whatever, such as sight, smell, touch, hearing, even cupidities and appetites, is induced so strongly, that they scarcely exist as strongly in the body itself; consequently, the sense of pain, which most atrocious pains would be induced by the devil's crew, unless God Messiah saved souls from such a hell. 1747, Dec. 21. </p>
