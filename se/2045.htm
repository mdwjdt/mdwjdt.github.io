<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2045</h4><p>2045. When they came into a wakeful state, however, they began to return again to their own nature, which was devoted to plotting subtle deceptions. So I was told that they had been able to be like that in a sleeping state, but not yet in a wakeful one, when their awareness and sensations are also awake and increasing. For all things awaken and increase in one's normal state, that of wakefulness and light. 1748, 22 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2045</h4><p>2045. But when they came into a state of wakefulness, they began to return again to their nature, which was given to the contrivance of subtle deceits, wherefore it was said to me that they could be of such a quality in a state of sleep, but not so well in a state of waking, in which the perceptions and sensations are also awake, and of greater vividness, for they are observant of everything, and are vivid according to the common state of wakefulness and light. - 1748, May 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2045 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2045. Sed cum venirent in statum vigiliae, iterum ceperunt {a} ad naturam suam redire, quae erat machinatrix dolorum subtilium, quare dictum mihi, quod potuissent tales esse in statu somni, sed non adhuc in statu vigiliae, in quo perceptiones et sensationes quoque vigilarent, et augescerent, nam vigilant omnia, et augescunt secundum statum communem, vigiliae et lucis. 1748, 22 Maj. </p>
