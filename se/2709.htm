<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2709</h4><p>2709. suddenly it appears to them as if they are in a prostitute woman's belly, and the woman seems immediately to change into a great dragon or snake, such as some of the heathen worship, and there the person remains covered over, in torment. For they seem to themselves covered over, and then seem to be without breath - and so they are devastated. This punishment recurs many times, and I was told even for many years, if not centuries and millennia, until they no longer remember those lusts, and not even themselves to the extent they had made life to consist therein. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2709</h4><p>2709. and then suddenly it appears to them, as if (they were in the belly of a meretricious woman, who, shortly [ilico] seems to them to be changed into a great dragon or serpent, such as some of the Gentiles adore [worship], and there [such a spirit] remains in [cum] torment, covered up; for he seems to himself covered up, and thus seems to be without respiration; and thus they are vastated. This punishment recurs many times, and I was told for many years, if not hundreds or thousands of years, until they no longer remember such cupidities; and not even themselves [qui], no matter how much of life they have passed [habuerint] in such things.) </p>
