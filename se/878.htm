<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 878</h4><p>878. About some rooms belonging to good spirits of the female sex<p>Rooms belonging to certain spirits of the female sex were shown to me, which are fashioned for them, and which they see as clearly as people on earth see theirs. There are entryways that open into their longer sides. They sit in the room to the side of the entrance, so as not to be gazed at. The walls are designed in many patterns, with floral combinations and similar lovely displays spread out across the wall; but I cannot describe the various scenes because they are countless, following in turn one upon another, with now brighter now lesser degrees of light, in different colors, sprouting forth delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 878</h4><p>878. CONCERNING CERTAIN ROOMS OF GOOD SPIRITS OF THE FEMALE SEX <p>The rooms of certain spirits of the female sex were shown me. They were formed for them and they see them as clearly as men on earth see theirs. There are long entrances which lead into them. They sit in the room at the side of the entrance so as not to be observed. The walls are formed with much variety by flowers joined together, and similar beautiful things, which extend transversely along the wall. I cannot, however, describe the varieties, for they are innumerable and succeed each other alternately, in clearer and less clear light, with various colors, and with delightfulness springing forth from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 878 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>878. De conclavibus quibusdam spirituum bonorum, sexus faeminini<p>Ostensa mihi sunt conclavia quorundam spirituum sexus faeminini, quae iis formantur, et quae vident tam clare, ac homines suamet; sunt introitus qui patent versus ea in longitudinem, in conclavi sedent a latere introitus, sic ut non conspiciantur, parietes formantur multa varietate, per flores combinatos, et similia, quae pulchra sunt, quae se extendunt transversim per parietem, sed varietates describere non possum, quia innumerabiles sunt, et succedunt, per vices, clariori luce, et minore luce, variis coloribus, cum delectatione ex iis pullulante. </p>
