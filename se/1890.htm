<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1890</h4><p>1890. Spirits insist on controlling people<p>There was a great dispute with spirits about the fact that they wanted to control me. For they are concerned with having the greatest power, and this has happened so frequently that I can hardly number the occasions. They try to hold a person in submission to themselves, doing so sometimes with such great persistence that they would not let up. They would even plot treachery, angered against any others who approached, whom they considered were about to seize control. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1890</h4><p>1890. THAT SPIRITS PRESS ON TO OBTAIN DOMINION OVER MAN. <p>There was a great dispute among the spirits growing out of the fact that they wished to rule me, for it is their aim to obtain the utmost stretch of power, and this was manifested so many times that I could scarcely number them. They burn to have man subjected to them, and that sometimes with such pertinacious eagerness that they can scarcely bring themselves to desist; yea, they had recourse to insidious wiles and were indignant towards certain others who approached, for the reason that they supposed they were designing to rob them of their dominion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1890 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1890. Quod spiritus instent, ut regant hominem<p>Cum spiritibus maxima disceptatio fuit, de eo, quod me regere vellent, nam apud eos est, ut summam potestatem habeant, et hoc ita multoties, ut vix numerare possim, hominem enim sibi subjectum habere cupiunt, idque quandoque cum tanta pertinacia, ut vix desistere vellent, imo insidiis egerunt; irati in quoscunque alios, qui accesserunt, ob causam, quod arbitrarentur eos dominatum iis erepturos. </p>
