<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>244.被囚之人从坑里得释放，就像女人腹中即将出生，已来到子宫口的未出生的婴儿。这是天国的一个奥秘，对此，我有几次被指教：先知们多次提到的被囚在坑里的人，或消磨的人不会从那里得以释放，除非惩罚或消磨结束。当这一切结束时，释放就像经历产痛的妇人分娩一样接着到来；有一种不能再抵抗的确切必要性敦促他们要继续奋斗，从奴役当中释放出来。但在这方面，关于那些正被消磨或惩罚之人的状态的许多事会照着消磨和惩罚，照着他们为之奋斗的释放状态，以及被释放的方式而发生；这些事会占用很多篇幅，不过我不认为这些事真的使信仰增加。天堂的状态具有这样的性质：它们若被解释给世人听，不但不会被世人相信，反而会把他们逼疯。这是由于那些除了自己所理解的外什么也不愿相信的人会怀疑；他们连离肉体感官最近的属世因素都不能理解，又如何能理解如此遥远的属灵和属天的事物呢？事实上，属灵和属天的事物距离感官最为遥远，然而他们却想通过感官来探究它们。（1747年11月12日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 244</h4><p>244. The liberation of the bound from the pit is like the coming of the unborn babe to the mouth of the womb in a woman about to give birth<p>A heavenly secret I have been instructed about several times, is that those who had been bound in the pit, or purged, of whom the prophets spoke so many times, are not set free from thence until their punishment or chastening has been completed. When this is completed, liberation ensues like [the delivery] with a woman in labor, in the sense that there is a certain necessity which can no longer be resisted, urging them to struggle forth, and to be set free from slavery.<p>But in this connection very many things come to mind about the condition of those who are being purged, or punished - regarding [the nature of] their chastening and punishment, and the state of liberty into which they struggle, and the modes by which they are set free - which would fill many pages, but which I do not think would really increase belief.<p>Heavenly states are of such a nature that if they were laid bare to anyone living in the world, they would not be believed, but would drive them crazy. This is due to the incredulity of those who want to believe nothing but what they understand, and [yet] are not able to understand the causes in nature that lie nearest to their physical senses. How then could they understand spiritual and heavenly things so remote, in fact the most remote, from the senses which they nevertheless want to use to investigate them? 1747, 12 November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 244</h4><p>244. THE DELIVERANCE OF THE BOUND FROM THE PIT, IS LIKE UNTO A WOMAN IN LABOR WHEN THE FOETUS COMES TO THE MOUTH OF THE WOMB <p>It is a heavenly arcanum concerning which I have sometimes been instructed, that those who were bound in the pit, or vastated, of whom the prophets so frequently speak, are not liberated therefrom until the punishment or vastation has been consummated. When this is ended the deliverance resembles that of a woman in labor in this respect, that there is a certain necessity which can no longer be resisted, which urges that they should struggle forth, and thus be delivered from bondage and set at liberty. But here very many things occur respecting the condition of those who are being vastated or punished, according to the vastation and punishment, according to the state of liberty for which they are striving, and according to the modes by which they are being liberated; these things would fill many pages, but nevertheless, I imagine, would never increase belief. Heavenly states are such that if they were explained to man they would not be believed but would drive him to madness, on account of the incredulity of those who are unwilling to believe anything except what they understand: and as they cannot understand the natural causes nearest to their senses, how can they understand spiritual and celestial things so remote, yea most remote from the senses, by which nevertheless they want to explore them. 1747, Nov. 12, o.s. </p>

Liberatio vinctorum a fovea, quod se habeat instar parturientis, cum foetus venit ad matricis os<p>Arcanum coeleste est, de quo aliquoties doctus sum quod ii, qui vincti sunt in fovea, seu vastati, de quibus toties prophetae, non prius inde liberentur, quam dum consummata sit punitio seu vastatio, qua consummata liberatio se instar parturientis habet, in eo, quod si quaedam necessitas, cui opponi amplius nequit, quae urget ut enitantur, et sic a servitute in libertatem vindicentur, sed hic perplura occurrunt, circa conditionem eorum qui vastantur aut puniuntur, secundum vastationem et punitionem, tum secundum statum libertatis in quem enituntur, tum secundum modos, quibus liberantur, quae plures paginas implerent, sed tamen nusquam, ut reor, fidem adjicerent; status coelestes tales sunt, ut si homini exponerentur, non crederentur, sed eum in deliria abducerent, propter incredulitatem eorum, qui nihil credere volunt, nisi quod intelligunt, nec intelligere possunt causas naturales proximas sensibus: quomodo tunc spiritualia et coelestia tam remota, imo remotissima a sensibus, quibus tamen ea explorare volunt? 1747 <sup>1</sup></p><p>, 12 Nov. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has volunt; 1747 </p>
