<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2320</h4><p>2320. Offenses could not but come [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_7.htm">Matt. 18:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_1.htm">Luke 17:1</a>]<p>I just realized by a spiritual mental image that offenses could not but come, since humankind has only a most general idea of truths, such as that the Lord rules all things. Because there are so countlessly many ideas conflicting with that very general one, causing people to question, How, then, could so many evils exist? - among many other objections - these cannot but arise in one's mind to break down that truth. For the mind understands nothing except by way of the bodily senses, believing itself capable on its own of acquiring faith, which the Lord Alone gives. So neither can the person have faith.<p>By a spiritual mental image I saw that such persons cannot but create for themselves objections one after another, and thus demolish truths of the faith. 1748, 13 June. If ignorance did not excuse, it would be finished with humankind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2320</h4><p>2320. THAT OFFENCES COULD NOT BUT COME. <p>I have now perceived by a spiritual idea that offences could not but come, since man is in a very general idea of truths; for instance, take that most general idea, that the Lord rules all things; inasmuch, then, as there are innumerable things which conflict [repugnant], causing man to doubt, as how thus can all evils exist, and very many other things; there cannot but be something to rise in the mind and destroy that truth, because he understands nothing except from sensuals and corporeals, and supposes himself able from these [ipsi for ipsis, I think] to acquire to himself faith, which the Lord alone bestows; therefore he cannot have faith. I saw in spiritual idea that there must be such as make for themselves continual conflicts [of mind], and so destroy the truths of faith. - 1748, June 13. Unless ignorance excused, it could be all over with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2320 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2320. Quod scandala <sup>1</sup></p><p>non potuerunt non venire [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2320/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_18_7" target=_top>Matth.

XVII: 1</a>]<p>Nunc idea spirituali percepi, quod scandala non potuerint non venire, cum homo in communissima idea est veritatum, sicut quod Dominus regat omnia: communissimam illam ideam <sup>2</sup></p><p>, quia tum innumera sunt, quae repugnant, quae faciunt hominem dubitare-sicut <sup>3</sup></p><p>quomodo omnia mala sic existere possunt, et alia perplurima-[haec] non <sup>4</sup></p><p>possunt non assurgere in mentem ejus <sup>5</sup></p><p>, et veritatem istam destruere, quia nihil intelligit, [nisi] solum <sup>6</sup></p><p>ex sensualibus et corporeis, et <sup>7</sup></p><p>quia <sup>8</sup></p><p>sibi ipsi fidem comparare [se] posse putat, quam Solus Dominus dat; ita nec potest habere fidem; in idea spirituali vidi, quod tales non possint, quin continuas sibi faciant repugnantias, et sic fidei veritates destruant; 1748, 13 Junius. Nisi ignorantiae excusarent, actum foret de homine.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has scandula<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has communissima illa idea<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has dubitare, sicut<p>4.&nbsp;The Manuscript has perplurima, non<p>5.&nbsp;The Manuscript has esse ut apparet<p>6.&nbsp;The Manuscript has intelligit; solum<p>7.&nbsp;The Manuscript has corporeis; et<p>8.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quod </p>
