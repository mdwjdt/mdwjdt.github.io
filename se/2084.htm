<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2084</h4><p>2084. A kind of repugnance is noticeable between people who eat foods that are mutually repugnant to them<p>It is a known fact that little children love Milk, but that adults become unaccustomed to it, and some cannot even take it without harmful results. So it is even a rule of doctors that Milk is harmful in sickness.<p>The reason it is harmful, when yet it is the simplest and most innocuous of all foods, is that people become used to drinks that are ill-tasting, especially beers, and when their stomach and intestines, as well as their blood, get used to these, then they cannot stand dairy food. When such people are first brought together in the other life, there is a kind of repugnance between them. For I smelled a distinct odor of beer coming from certain spirits, when I had drunk milk. 1748, 26 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2084</h4><p>2084. THAT THERE IS OBSERVABLE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE AMONGST THOSE WHO LIVE ON FOOD FOR WHICH THEY HAVE NOT A TASTE. <p>It is known that infants love milk, and that adults are unaccustomed thereto, so that some will not indeed admit but that it does them harm; wherefore also it is a rule of the physicians that milk is injurious in case of sickness. The reason why it is hurtful, although it is the simplest diet, and above all things free from harm, is that men accustom themselves to drinks for which they have not a taste, especially to malt liquors, hence their stomach and bowels grow accustomed thereto as well as the blood, which therefore cannot bear a milk diet. When such persons are first associated in the other life there is a sort of repugnance; for I perceived manifestly the odor of ale from certain [of them] when I drank milk. - 1748, May 26. </p>
