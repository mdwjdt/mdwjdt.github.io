<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2424</h4><p>2424. About hereditary evil<p>By spiritual imagery I clearly saw, as did the souls and spirits who were present at the same time, that hereditary evil comes from the first human being, increased by all the succeeding fathers and mothers one after the other, and to be sure, by each one in a successive series, by their own acquired evils derived into their children and at length acquired by everyone for themselves. So it was also made clear that in the human being, due to hereditary evil, there is nothing but evil thus multiplied. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2424</h4><p>2424. CONCERNING HEREDITARY EVIL <p>I perceived plainly by a spiritual idea, [as did] also at the same time the souls and spirits present, that hereditary evil is increased from the first man through all succeeding fathers and mothers in order, and indeed through everyone in successive series, by proper [propria] acquired evils, derived into children, and at length also acquired by themselves. Therefore was it also manifested that in man there is nothing but evil thus multiplied [proceeding] from hereditary evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2424 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2424. De malo haereditario<p>Per ideam spiritualem manifeste percepi, simul etiam animae et spiritus, qui aderant, quod malum haereditarium sit a primo homine, per omnes ordine succedentes patres et matres auctum, et quidem per unumquemvis in serie successiva, per propria mala acquisita, quae derivata in liberos, et tandem quisque per se acquisita {a}, ita, quoque manifestatum quod in homine ex malo haereditario nihil sit nisi malum ita multiplicatum. </p>
