<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3027</h4><p>3027. from love in the will. So he was told that he could try and see how it would go. Therefore he sought for a society of the kind who were absorbed in love, and finally he found them, saying that he had found them. Then he was raised up into heaven.<p>While awaiting to see what would happen, I was speaking with the rest of the spirits, saying that if he was the kind who could receive love from the Lord, he would be able to stay among them, otherwise he would not be able. While we were waiting, he was seen, or some were seen rolling themselves down from heaven, which is a sign that they are tearing themselves away from a society because they cannot endure it there, just as in an atmosphere in which they cannot live.<p>He is now with spirits overhead, saying that he had been there, yet could not live there, but was in great anguish, so he is extremely happy that he was able to be liberated from there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3027</h4><p>3027. Wherefore it was told [him], that he might attempt how he could succeed; therefore he sought for a society which was of such a character, to wit, [one] that was in love; and at last found [one], and said that he has found it; thus was raised up into heaven. I expected what would take place, [and] meanwhile spoke with the remaining spirits [to the effect] that if he was of such a nature that he can receive love from the Lord, he would be able to subsist amongst them, otherwise, that he would not be able. While we expected [what would happen], [he] was seen, or [they] were seen who rolled themselves from heaven; which is a proof that they snatch themselves forth from a society because they cannot subsist there, as if [they were] in a sphere wherein they cannot subsist. He [is] now with [spirits] above the head, [and] says that he was there, but could not live there, but that he was greatly distressed, so that he greatly rejoices that he could thence have been liberated. - 1748, September 1. </p>
