<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2653</h4><p>2653. and the goodness of their works to themselves, denying them to the Lord. Thus the more one does this, the farther one distances oneself from heaven.<p>This is a well established truth and can be corroborated in many ways by them in the other life, for in so doing they interpose a kind of chasm between two mountains, so that they cannot cross over onto the other mountain without falling headlong into the chasm, or else an intervening sea into which a person plunges, shipwrecked, who wants in this way to cross over into heaven-who must therefore go back, and be led by a different way by the Lord. 1748, 19 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2653</h4><p>2653. and attributes to himself faith, charity, and the goodness of his good works: therefore the more he does so, the farther he puts himself [from heaven]. This is a confirmed truth, and may be confirmed in many [ways] by them in the other life; thus they also interpose for themselves, as it were, [fauces] between two mountains, so that [such a one] [cannot] pass over to the other mountain without falling headlong into the [fauces], or, as it were, an intervening sea, wherein being ship wrecked he precipitates [drowns] himself if he wishes to cross thus to heaven, wherefore he must go back, and is led by the Lord through another way. - 1748, July 19. </p>
