<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4191</h4><p>4191. About a correspondence<p>Again certain ones spoke within the aura of angelic spirits while I was sleeping, and I dreamt that my father in life was falling into the water, so that he was under water, and I pulled him up and carried him. When I woke up, they said that they had spoken about my writings out of the Word. The Word with me had previously been portrayed by my father in life, so that their conversation was falling into this portrayal. 1749, 1 April. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Jupiter, meaning Thursday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4191</h4><p>4191. CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCE.<p>Again certain ones spoke within the sphere of angelic spirits, while I was asleep, in consequence of which I dreamed that my father in his life-time had fallen into the water and sunk to a considerable depth, but that I had, lifted him up, and brought him to the shore. Upon my awaking they said that they were speaking of the things which I had written from the Word; the Word with me was represented in the first instance by my father in his life-time; thus their discourses fell into such a representative. - 1749, April 1. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4191 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4191. De correspondentia<p>Iterum quidam loquuti intra sphaeram spirituum angelicorum, cum in somno essem, et somniavi, quod pater meus in vita caderet in aquas, sic ut immersus, et ego inde eum sustuli, et portavi, cum expergefactus dicebant se loquutos de illis quae scripsi, ex Verbo, Verbum apud me repraesentatum fuit prius per patrem meum in vita, ita sermo eorum cadebat in tale repraesentativum. 1749, 1 April. </p>
