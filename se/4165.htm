<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4165</h4><p>4165. About a flood of evils<p>I have very often experienced being withheld and raised up, so to speak, that is toward inward regions, thus into the company of good spirits, and then withheld from evil spirits, and I realized, and felt, that if I were to be let go of even very slightly, evil spirits would flood me with their persuasions and principles of falsity and evil, and I realized and felt that to the extent that I was let go of, they would inundate me. 1749, 9 Mar. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Jupiter, meaning Thursday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4165</h4><p>4165. CONCERNING THE INUNDATION ARISING FROM EVIL SPIRITS.<p>I have often experienced that I was withheld, and, as it were, elevated, that is, towards interior things, thus into the societies of the good, and in this manner kept from evil spirits. I have also perceived and felt that if I had been let down but a little, the evil spirits would have inundated me with their persuasions and false and evil principles; I also perceived that in proportion as I was let down, they did inundate me. - 1749, March 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4165 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4165. De inundatione malorum<p>Expertus saepius quod detentus sim et quasi sublatus, hoc est versus intriora, ita in consortia bonorum, et sic a malis spiritibus detentus, et percepi et sensi, si aliquantisper remitteretur, quod inundarent mali spiritus cum suis persuasionibus et principiis falsi et mali, et percepi et sensi, quod quantum remitterentur, inundarent. 1749, 9 Mart </p>
