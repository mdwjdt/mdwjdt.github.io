<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2263</h4><p>2263. Human Philosophy consists only of terminology<p>I spoke with spirits about the Philosophy of the world, which is regarded as wisdom, saying that it is only vocabulary. It discusses qualities, accidents, forces, substances, and the like, also spirits and other like concepts; but they have no other concern but to know what those words mean, such as what are accidents, substances, and many more, debating the meaning of the words, as if there were something real in them, when yet they are only words.<p>Likewise, when they find a meaning, they debate whether the words mean something that can be comprehended by one word, thus a single mental image. While they who do this have numerous truths, because they had been able to see a thing from experience in themselves and the world, because they dispute about them, to them everything becomes confused, becomes trivia to which they cling, consequently material and bodily things, so nothing comes of it but a putting out of the true light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2263</h4><p>2263. THAT THE PHILOSOPHY OF MEN IS ONLY A VOCABULARY. <p>I spoke with spirits concerning the philosophy of the world, wherein they place wisdom, [to the effect] that it is but a vocabulary; for it is there treated as of qualities, accidents, forces [viribus] substances, and the like, as also of spirits, and other such matters, and they care for nothing else than to know what these words signify, as [for instance], what [is signified] by accidents, substances, and many other [words], and they dispute concerning the signification of words, as if there was anything real therein, when yet they are only words. In like manner when any signification is found out [invenitur] whether or no they signify it, so that they may be comprehended by one word, therefore by one idea. But those who do this possess many truths, because they were able to see it from experience in themselves and the world but because they dispute about these things, everything becomes confused and dust, and they inhere therein, consequently in material and corporeal things, so that hence [results] nothing but darkening [obfuscatio] the true light [lumen]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2263 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2263. Quod Philosophia hominum sit modo vocabularium<p>Cum spiritibus loquutus sum de Philosophia mundi, in qua ponunt sapientiam, quod solum sit vocabularium, nam agitur ibi de qualitatibus, accidentibus, viribus, substantiis et similiter <sup>1</sup></p><p>, tum de spiritibus, aliisque similibus, et nihil aliud curant, quam ut sciant, quid voces istae significant, sicut quid accidentia, substantiae, et plura alia, ac de significatione vocum disputant, sicut aliquid reale in iis esset, cum tamen sint modo voces; similiter dum significatio invenitur, annon id {a} significent, ut comprehendi possunt una voce, sic una idea; sed qui hoc faciunt, veritates plures habent, quia ab experientia in semet et mundo id videre potuerunt, sed quia disputant de iis, omnia fiunt confusa, et pulvis, et iis<p>(2264.) inhaerent, proinde materialibus, et corporeis, ita nihil inde, nisi obfuscatio veri luminis, quare dum per talia in spiritualia et coelestia velint intrare, in meras umbras se praecipitant, sicut dum pulvis velit [intrare] in claram lucem, ita obfuscatur lux, quasi nimbo, nube, tenebris, caligine, in quibus dein ponunt lucem, et sapientiam, quare sapientia eorum est mera obtenebratio luminis, ita occoecant semet, et nulli mortalium sunt minus sapientes, quam qui ita procedunt, et ex philosophia tali, quae est pulvis talis, velint in spiritualia intrare-sicut <sup>2</sup></p><p>pro exemplo, quod spiritus sit substantia-quibus <sup>3</sup></p><p>non modi adscribendi; cum disputatur de substantia et modis, quid sunt, quid inde nisi merae caligines, sic errores, proinde negationes? 1748, 9 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has intrare, sicut<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has substantia, quibus </p>
