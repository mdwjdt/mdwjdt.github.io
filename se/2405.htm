<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2405</h4><p>2405. Then there was also a discussion of unity. A oneness can never exist that can be said to have any power and character, if it does not consist of many, or a group of many, in fact groups of groups of many, as well as groups of a higher order, that flow in. And a unity can never exist, nor the resulting happiness, if all do not love the neighbor more than themselves, and esteem themselves as nothing in comparison with their neighbor. And this kind of love can never exist except from the Love of the Lord, Who Alone is Love. 1748, 25 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2405</h4><p>2405. Then was there also discourse concerning union, as that never a single thing can be given of which any faculty and quality may be predicated, unless there are many, or a society of many - yea, societies of societies of many, and still greater numbers [superiores], that inflow as well as that union is never capable of being given [dabilis], hence felicity [derived] thence, unless everyone loves his neighbor more than himself and esteems himself as nothing in respect to his neighbor; and that such love is never capable of being given, except from the love of the Lord, who alone is love. - 1748, June 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2405 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2405. Tum quoque sermo fuit, de unione, quod nusquam unum dari queat, de quo facultas aliqua ac qualitas praedicari possit, nisi sint plures, aut societas plurium, imo societates societatum plurium, et adhuc superiores, quae influunt; tum quod unio nusquam dabilis sit, proinde felicitas inde, nisi quisque amet proximum plus quam semet, et se nihil aestimet respective ad proximum; et quod talis amor nusquam dabilis sit, nisi ex Amore Domini, Qui unicus est Amor. 1748, 25 Junius. </p>
