<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2312</h4><p>2312. I was given to see and feel how this wells up from deep within spirits, and likewise from humans on earth, and that its root is a hatred of truth and goodness, consequently, anger. The anger was so subtle, sensitive, and at the same time, general, that I could not tell where it was coming from, or that it was coming from an urge common to all. So that I would be in a state of fine sensitivity, this happened just when I was awakening from sleep. At this sensitive time there was an awareness of things in the world of spirits different from when I have been awake for a long time, for when one first wakes up, all things down to the very least are discerned restfully for what they are, but not in a time of commotion. Thoughts of the spirit are also aroused and stirred up by the commotion of wakefulness, so there is at that time not such a fine sensitivity as at first awakening. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2312</h4><p>2312. Then was it given to perceive that hatred of the true and the good, consequently that anger [proceeds] from the interior of spirits, consequently of men, thus is inrooted; for it was so subtle, perceptive [perceptiva] and common at the same time, that it could not have been distinguished whence [it came], therefore because [it proceeded] from the conatus of all. In order that I might be [gifted] with subtle perception, it happened as soon as I awoke from sleep, at which time there was a subtle perception of those things which [are] in the world of spirits; it is otherwise when I [have been] long awake, for when first awake, then all things are perceived in repose of what quality they are; but [this is not the case] during a disturbance [turba]. The thoughts of spirits are also excited and disturbed by the confusion [turba] of wakefulness, wherefore perception is not so subtle at that time as at the first waking. </p>
