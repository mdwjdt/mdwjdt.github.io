<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2202</h4><p>2202. I also observed that when they have discovered someone's character to a certain extent as a result of some experience, they then learn more about what he or she is like. The ability is almost inborn in them to draw conclusions from one fact about a further one, thinking that if they are such in this situation, it follows that they will be like this in others. So they lead a soul or spirit through various situations, which tally with their previous judgment. Nevertheless, they are sometimes mistaken, because they judge by only bodily and earthly standards and do not know the person's inward and more inward parts, which the Lord Alone knows. 1748, 5 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2202</h4><p>2202. It is also observed that when they became cognizant in any manner of any one's disposition [genius] from whatever experience, that then they knew better of what quality he is; for this is, as it were, innate [connatus] [with them] to conclude one thing from another, and because he is such in this, that it follows he is such in others. Thus they lead the soul or spirit through various things, which accord with the assumed judgment. Yet they are sometimes mistaken, because they judge by corporeals and naturals solely, and do not know his interior and more interior things, which are known to the Lord alone. - 1748, June 5. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2202 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2202. Observatum etiam est, quod dum norunt aliqualiter alicujus genium, ex quacunque experientia, quod tunc sciant plura, qualis est, nam hoc quasi connatum est, quod ex uno concludatur de alio, et quia talis est in hoc, talis sequatur quod sit in aliis, ita animam seu spiritum ducunt per varia, quae praecepto judicio congruunt, tametsi quandoque falluntur, quia a solis corporeis et naturalibus judicant, nec sciunt ejus interiora, et intimiora, quae Solus Dominus novit. 1748, 5 Junius. </p>
