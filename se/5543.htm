<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5543</h4><p>5543. ABOUT THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THE NEW JERUSALEM<p>I saw an enormous multitude sent down from heaven toward the east and allotted a place there toward the front. Those who were evil were allotted places in uninhabited areas round about and thrown into hells. Those who were good received houses to live in. After this I heard an enormous multitude who had been sent down from heaven to all the remaining quarters round about, the western, southern, and northern, with whom the same thing happened; and those who were good were allotted houses and dwellings there. This went on for several hours, through the whole night. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5543</h4><p>5543. ABOUT THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THE NEW JERUSALEM. <p>I saw that a vast multitude was let down out of heaven eastwards, and there allotted a place towards the front. Those who were evil were cast round about into deserts and into hells: those who were good lighted upon mansions there, to dwell in. Afterwards, I heard an immense concourse, which was let down out of heaven to all the rest of the quarters round about, to the western, southern and northern, with whom it fell out in like manner; and those who were good were allotted mansions and dwellings there. This lasted through several hours, during the whole night. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5543 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5543. DE ULTIMO JUDICIO ET NOVA HIEROSOLYMA<p>Vidi quod ingens multitudo e coelis demissa sit versus orientem, et ibi antrorsus locum sortita, qui mali circumcirca in deserta et in inferna conjecti, qui boni ibi nacti mansiones ad habitandum. Postea audivi ingentem multitudinem, quae demissa est e coelo ad omnes reliquas plagas circum circa, ad occidentalem, meridionalem et septentrionalem, cum quibus similiter factum, et qui boni sortiti ibi mansiones, et habitationes; hoc perstabat per plures horas, per totam noctem. </p>
