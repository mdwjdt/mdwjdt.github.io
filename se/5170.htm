<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5170</h4><p>5170. About the hell of those who are outwardly innocent but inwardly evil, wolves<p>Some were detected, from far behind on the left, to the north there, who had a custom of sending spirits out from themselves and presenting them naked from head to heel, by which they showed that they were innocent, and because they made themselves [appear] innocent they deceived others. On this account I too was turned in that direction, so that it could be known what this is like, and I spoke with them. They said that they present themselves to be seen in this way by others, they were then on a rock, and that by doing this they are able to communicate with everyone all around far into the distance, and that by so doing they are accepted by the simple good, through whom they do everything evil they want. They communicate with them and by so doing they have control and enlist all who are of such a nature. And what they do, they do secretly. Because their nature is such, they are stripped of their outer innocence, which was seen happening, and they were then dispersed and cast into hell, everyone according to his evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5170</h4><p>5170. CONCERNING THE HELL OF THOSE WHO ARE OUTWARDLY INNOCENT, BUT INWARDLY EVIL AND WOLVES.<p>There were detected some, at a distance behind, on the left, in the north there, who were in the habit of sending forth spirits from themselves, and presenting them naked from head to heel. By this they signified that they were innocent; and, inasmuch as they made themselves out innocent in order to deceive others, therefore, also, I was carried thither, so that the nature of this thing might be known. I also spoke with them; and they said that they thus present themselves to the view of others. They were then on a rock. [They said], also, that they are, in this way, able to hold communication with all who are round about, to a distance; that, by this means, they are received by the simple good, and, through their [viz., the simple good] doing all that the evil wish, they communicate with them, and hence have dominion over them. [They said], moreover, that they take to themselves all who are of such a character; and that what they do, they do secretly. Because they are of such a character, therefore external innocence is taken away from them, as was seen; and then they are dispersed, and cast into hells, everyone according to his evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5170 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5170. De inferno eorum qui extrinsecus innocentes sunt, sed intus mali, lupi<p>Detecti sunt quidam e longinquo retro ad sinistrum ad septentrionem ibi, qui pro more habebant ex se emittere spiritus, et sistere eos nudos a capite ad calcem, per quod significabnt quod essent innocentes, et quia se faciebant innocentes, ut deciperent alios, ideo etiam illuc vectus sum, ut sciretur quale hoc est, et loquutus sum cum illis, qui dicebant, quod ita sistant se ad conspectum aliorum, erant tunc in petra, et quod sic possint communicationem habere cum cunctis circum circa, in longinquum, quod per id recipiantur a simplicibus bonis, per quos faciant omnia quae mali volunt, communicent cum illis, inde illis dominium; tum quod recipiant ad se omnes qui tales sunt, et quod agunt, clam agant; quia tales, ideo innocentia externa illis adempta est, quod visum, et tunc dissipati, et conjecti in inferna quisque secundum malum suum. </p>
