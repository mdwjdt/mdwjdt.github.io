<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4420</h4><p>4420. About sirens when they are laying snares at night, and trying to obsess man, and their punishments<p>There were sirens around me for weeks, toward the left up above, on several occasions right overhead, but for the most part toward the left, higher up. By means of their magical arts and profane adulteries, they had harassed me, finally arriving at the point where they spoke exactly as if in the body. From their conversation I realized that they imagined they were completely in the world, which I also heard them declare and I told to the others. And this is the sign that they wish completely to return into the world, thus completely to obsess a personas they indeed attempted to do to me at night when I was sleeping. They labored by various arts to enter into and to obsess me, and, as said, to cast out my spirit, and station their own there. It was clearly seen that they wanted to do this. Overhead toward the front they cast themselves in. I even touched their hands in that state, among other things. But they were punished most severely, by the harsh punishment of being torn to pieces as to the head and bones, which were entirely broken, with immense pain, and this lasted for a long time, for hours. They wanted to escape by similar tricks that they had practiced in the world, by lying, pretending to be something else, but they were told that this is futile in the other life, for the thoughts and deeds of all are known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4420</h4><p>4420. CONCERNING THE SIRENS WHEN THEY LAY SNARES BY NIGHT AND SEEK TO OBSESS MAN; AND CONCERNING THEIR PUNISHMENTS.<p>There were [male] sirens about me for several weeks, to the left above; and sometimes entirely above the head, but for the most part to the left above; these harassed me by their magic arts and profane adulteries, and at length went so far as to speak just as if in the body. I perceived from their speech that they thought themselves to be altogether in the world, which they also said [they were]; this I heard and mentioned to others. This is an inclination that they wish actually to return into the world, thus wholly to obsess man, which they also attempted with me by night while I was asleep. They labored by various arts to enter into me, and thus to obsess me and, as was said, to cast out my spirit and to substitute their own. The fact of their having this desire was perfectly evident; they, as it were, cast themselves into me, from their station above the head in front. I touched their hands in that state, besides other things which might be mentioned. But they were punished very severely, by a peculiar punishment of laceration as to the head and bones, which were in fact completely broken, with excessive pain - a punishment continued for a long time, even for hours. They wished to escape by arts like those which they practiced in the world, by lying and urging various pretexts; but it was told them that this was in vain in the other life, for that all thoughts and actions were known there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4420 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4420. De sirenibus cum insidiantur noctu et obsidere hominem volunt et poenis earum<p>Fuerunt sirenes per septimanas circum me, ad sinistrum superne, aliquoties prorsus supra caput, sed utplurimum ad sinistrum superius, ii per suas magicas artes, et prophana adulteria, me lacesserunt; et tandem venerunt eo usque ut loquerentur prorsus sicut in corpore, ex loquela percipiebam quod putarent prorsus esse in mundo, quod et dixerunt, auditum, et dictum aliis; et hoc indicium est, quod prorsus redire in mundum velint, ita obsidere hominem prorsus, quod et nocte tentarunt apud me cum dormirem, variis artibus allaborabant intrare in me, et sic obsidere, ac ut dictum, meum spiritum ejicere, et suum ibi habere, visi etiam prorsus quod ita vellent, supra caput antrorsum se injiciebant, tetigi etiam in statu illo manus earum, praeter plura: sed puniti sunt gravissime, per atrocem poenam lacerationis quoad caput et ossa, quae iis prorsus frangerentur, cum dolore immani, et hoc perstabat diu, per horas; volebant eludere per similia, quae exercuerunt in mundo, mentiendo, alia fingendo, sed iis dictum, quod hoc incassum in altera, nam omnium cogitata et facta sciuntur. </p>
