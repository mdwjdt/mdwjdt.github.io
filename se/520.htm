<p>520.这些最低级的灵人当中有一个被带到我这里，好叫我了解他们是何品质。至于他的情况，这个灵人发黑，他觉得自己似乎张开双臂在天上飞翔，就像在水中游泳的人一样。这起因于以下事实：活在肉身期间，他们不是直立行走，而是爬行，不过脸向前看，而不是向下看；向下看对他们来说是一种耻辱，是最卑贱的那类人的一个标志。他们将那些向下看的人称为受诅咒的，这种人被逐出去，到别的地方为自己寻找食物。此外，他们像我们地球人那样坐在座位上，然后直起身来。因此，被称为圣徒的第二类灵人，他们的脸看上去是火红的，不像第一类那样看似在天上游泳，而是坐着。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 520</h4><p>520. One of their spirits of the lowest kind was brought to me, so that I might learn from him what they are like. As to his condition, this one was from among those who are dark, who seem to themselves to be flying in heaven, like swimmers in water, with their arms outstretched. This comes from the fact that in the life of the body, they do not walk upright, but creep, yet with their face looking straight forward, but not down, which to them is a disgrace, and characteristic of the very lowest kind. Those who look downward, they call the damned, and they are banished, to seek sustenance for themselves elsewhere. Besides this, like the people of our planet, they sit on seats, and are then upright. Therefore the second kind, called saintly, whose face looks fiery, do not swim in heaven like [the first], but sit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 520</h4><p>520. One of their spirits of the lowest kind was brought to me that I might thence know of what quality they are. As to his state he was dark, and he seemed to himself to be flying in heaven with arms extended, like swimmers in water. This arises from the fact that in the life of the body they do not walk erect, but creep, yet with the face looking forwards, but not downwards which with them is disgraceful and a mark of the vilest kind. Those who look downwards they called damned, and such are banished that they may seek food for themselves elsewhere. Moreover, like the men of our earth they sit upon seats, and then they are erect; hence the other kind which is called holy, and in whose face there is as it were something fiery, do not thus swim in heaven, but are seated. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;According to the Index (s.v. Foviales), "In the life of the body they creep in their own fashion." Cf. AC 8371. </p>

Unus eorum spiritus ex genere infimo ad me allatus est, ut inde scirem, quales sint, is, quoad ejus statum, erat [ex] obscuris, et [hi] sibi videntur volare in coelo, sicut natatores in aquis, brachiis extensis, quod inde venit, quia in vita corporis non erecti ambulant, sed repunt, antrorsum tamen facie eorum <sup>1</sup></p><p>spectante, non vero deorsum, quod apud eos est turpe, et generis vilissimi; qui deorsum spectant, eos vocant damnatos, et exterminantur, ut sibi victum quaerant aliunde, praeterea sedent sicut homines nostrae telluris super sedibus, et tunc erecti sunt, inde alterum genus, quod vocatur sanctum, et facie est quasi igneum, non sic natant in coelo, sed sedent.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has orum </p>
