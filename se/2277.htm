<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2277</h4><p>2277. From that vivid experience lasting several hours, I was later taught by what I believe with conviction was an actual voice, that the prophets of old had been obsessed in this manner, so that spirits at that time, when they took possession of them, took over their whole body, and it was then as if nothing of the person was left, while spirits possessed all things down to the very least, and hence conducted themselves so insanely. The Lord, however, was guiding them so that they would not bring evil on anyone. Thus nothing at all belonging to those who were obsessed was left to them.<p>Whether it was the same with the prophets who wrote, and knew nothing of the things being spoken, or how much they knew-whether it was only words they had not understood-I do not yet know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2277</h4><p>2277. By that living experience, of some hours' [duration], I was afterwards instructed by a living voice, as I admit, with persuasion, that in a similar manner were the prophets of old [veteres] obsessed, to wit, that when spirits occupied them they occupied the whole of their body, and then that there was nothing of man left, as it were, but that the spirits possessed each and all of his [parts], and hence directed themselves so insanely; the Lord nevertheless directing that they might not bring mischief on anyone. Thus those who were obsessed had nothing of themselves left [ita nihil eorum, qui obsessi erant, relquum sibi habuerunt]. Whether it had been the same with the prophets who wrote, and who knew nothing of those things which they spoke, or how much they had known whether [it was] only words which they had not understood, I do not yet know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2277 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2277. Ab experientia ista viva, aliquot horarum, instruebar postea viva voce ut reor, cum persuasione, quod similiter prophetae veteres fuerint obsessi, nempe quod spiritus tunc cum occuparent eos, occuparent totum eorum corpus, et quod tunc nihil hominis esset quasi reliquum, sed spiritus possiderent omnia et singula ejus, et inde tam insane se dirigebant, Domino tamen dirigente, ne cuiquam malum inferrent: ita nihil prorsus eorum, qui obsessi erant, reliquum sibi habuerunt: num similiter fuerit cum prophetis qui scripserunt, et nihil sciverunt ex iis, quae loquebantur, vel quantum scivissent, si modo verba, quae non intellexissent, nondum scio. </p>
