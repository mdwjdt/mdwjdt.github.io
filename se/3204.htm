They read from afar what was written<p>When some were moved, as it appeared, far away, and in fact, to such a distance that they were only faintly heard, they were then reading what was written from there better than I myself, being almost orally present with me. This all shows that distance is an imaginary something. 1748, 19 Sept. </p>

THAT THEY HAVE READ [MY] WRITING FROM AFAR. <p>When certain were removed, according to appearance, to a distance, yea to such a distance that they were but slightly heard, they then read [my] writing from thence by [with] their mouth [acting] in [apud] me, better than I [could]. Since they were thus able to see thence, from which it is apparent that distance is an imaginary thing. - 1748, September 19. </p>
