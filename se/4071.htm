<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4071</h4><p>4071. Later they were seen separated from their parents. They were not content to be there, wishing to withdraw for the reason that they would then be separated. From this one might conclude that they also were of a haughty spirit. # # # #<p># # # # Later it was shown of what kind was the still later progeny, and how the Church was corrupted. This was shown by means of an inflow into the right [side of the] face, that focused on the right eye, where feelings reside, and twisted around to the right and to the left, for the life of their feelings was turned into a life of passions. The ancient Church preserved its axis, which was Noah, but the rest were thus portrayed, and wandered away into various passions. They were not gathered into kingdoms, but into families and nations, which families and nations in this manner receded from goodness and consequently from truth. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph, written at the bottom of a page, first bore the number 4078, which was later corrected into 4071, so that 4078 is lacking. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4071</h4><p>4071. Being soon afterwards separated from their parents, they were not content to remain where they were, but wished to recede still further; the reason was that they had previously become so separated, whence it may be concluded that they were of lofty mind. * * * * * * * * * * It was afterwards shown of what quality was the still later progeny, and how the Church was perverted; viz. by an influx into the right side of the face, which was concentrated about the right eye, where the affections are seated, and was then cedeflected to the right and left, for the life of their affections was turned into the life of cupidities. The Ancient Church preserved its axis, who was Noah, but the rest were thus represented, and were borne away into various cupidities. They were not collected into kingdoms, but into families and nations, which families and nations in this manner receded from good and consequently from truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4071 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4071. Postea visi separati a parentibus suis, erant non contenti quod ibi essent, secedere volentes, ex causa, quia separarentur, inde concludi potuit, quod quoque animo elato. <p># # # # # # # # Postea ostensum est qualis proles adhuc sequens, et quomodo Ecclesia perversa, per influxum in faciem dextram, quae concentrabatur ad oculum dextrum, ubi affectiones, et circumtorquebatur ad dextrum et sinistrum; nam vita eorum affectionum versa est in vitam cupiditatum. Ecclesia antiqua servavit suum axem, qui erat Noachus, at caeteri ita repraesentati sunt, et vagati in varias cupiditates, non erant in regna collecti, sed in familias et gentes, quae familiae et gentes ita recesserunt a bono, et sic a vero. <sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;haec paragraphus ad imam paginam scripta, primum numerum 4078 tulit, qui serius in 4071 emendatus est, quare etiam 4078 desit </p>
