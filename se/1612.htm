<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1612</h4><p>1612. They then spoke with me through spirits. The spirits at the time could not help speaking, even though, when they reflected on the fact that they were being led by those in the inward heaven, they were conscious of being compelled and wanted to be separated from them. Normally, when not reflecting, they think when they are being activated, that they are in control, on which subject I also spoke with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1612</h4><p>1612. They then spoke with me through spirits, who could not do otherwise than speak, although they reflected upon the fact that they were led by those who were in the interior heaven, perceived the compulsion, and desired to be separated from them. On other occasions reflection is dormant, and while thus impelled they suppose themselves to be under their own control, on which subject I also spoke with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1612 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1612. Loquuti dein mecum sunt per spiritus, tunc spiritus non potuerunt aliter ac loqui, tametsi, cum reflecterent super id, quod ducerentur per eos qui in coelo interiori, coactionem perceperunt, et ab iis separari cupiebant, alioquin absque reflexione, dum aguntur, putant sui juris esse, de quibus cum iis quoque loquutus sum. <sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has est </p>
