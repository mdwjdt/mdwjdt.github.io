<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1903</h4><p>1903. Souls after death are unaware of being in the other life, when they are not enabled to reflect<p>Souls have lost nothing whatever of the properties they had had in their bodily life, as you may see stated here and there [<a href="207.htm">207</a>, <a href="364.htm">364</a>, <a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="1243.htm">1243</a>, <a href="1719.htm">1719</a>], and consequently they cannot realize and do not know that they are in the other life, but think they are in the world. This is because they lack the reflection which is aroused by memories, and this fact is not aroused in their memory except by objects. There are not any objects unless presented by those who are in company with them. Reflection is given, of course, that they are in the other life, but by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1903</h4><p>1903. THAT SOULS AFTER DEATH DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN THE OTHER LIFE, UNLESS BY MEANS OF REFLECTION GRANTED THEM. <p>That souls lose nothing of the things which they had in the life of the body, you will see everywhere affirmed; thus they neither know nor can know that they are in the other life, but [suppose] that they are in the world, inasmuch as they are without that reflection which is excited by things stored up in the memory, nor is that which is in the memory excited except by means of objects, and objects are not presented unless by those who are in society together. Reflection is also given, but by the Lord, that they are in the other life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1903 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1903. Quod animae post mortem non sciant quod in altera vita sint, absque data iis reflexione<p>Quod animae nihil amiserint ex iis, quae habuerunt in vita corporis, passim dictum videas [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1903/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_207" target=_top>207</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1903/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_364" target=_top>364</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1903/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_400" target=_top>400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1903/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1243" target=_top>1243</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1903/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1719" target=_top>1719</a>], ita nec scire possunt, nec sciunt quod in altera vita sunt, sed [putant] quod in mundo, quia absque reflexione, quae exsuscitatur ab iis quae in memoria, nec exsuscitatur id in eorum memoria, nisi ab objectis, objecta non sunt, nisi quae ab iis in societate. Datur quoque reflexio, sed a Domino, quod in altera vita sint. </p>
