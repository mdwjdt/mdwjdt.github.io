<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5899</h4><p>5899. About cats<p>Viewed by angels certain ones appear as cats. They are those who can be in the Divine aura and not be tormented, which amazed me. There was a certain one like this who was in the above-mentioned aura, even interiorly, and did not withdraw, and I was told from heaven that spirits like this can ascend into certain heavens and be present there and not be driven off by the wisdom of the angels like others; however there are those there who speak and order them to go away, and so they go away. Those who order them have power from the Lord. The reason that spirits like this are cats is because those are cats who have been outwardly religious, lived morally and gone to church, listened to the preaching but paid no attention to what was being preached; and so they are those who have not taken in any concepts about what is true and good. They have not listened to these things but only heard the sound without thinking. B[aron] Stjerncrona <sup>1</sup>too was like this. He only sang amen and gave no attention to any concepts.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See footnoted information on him in passage <a href="4754.htm">4754</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5899</h4><p>5899. CATS. <p>Some, when explored by the angels, appear as cats. They are those who are able to be in the sphere of the Divine without being tortured; at which I marveled. There was one such in the sphere mentioned above, and interiorly in it; nor did he retire. It was also told me out of heaven, that such ones are able to ascend into certain heavens and stay, nor can they be driven away by the angelic sphere, like others; but there are some there who command them, by word of mouth, to begone, and thus they go away. Those who so command are in power from the Lord. The reason that such are cats, is, because those are cats who have been in external worship and have lived morally, and also attended church, and listened to the sermons, but have given no heed whatever to the things that were preached, and who thus did not imbibe any knowledges of truth and good; - to which they had paid no attention, but only to the speech without the sense. Such, moreover, was B[aron] Stjerncrona, who merely sang, Amen, but paid no attention to any knowledges. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5899 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5899. De felibus<p>Quidam inspecti ab angelis apparent sicut feles, qui sunt qui possunt in sphaera Divini esse et non cruciari, quod miratus sum, erat quidam talis in sphaera supradicta, etiam interius, nec recessit, et dictum mihi e coelo, quod tales possunt ascendere in quosdam coelos ac interesse, nec abigi possunt sicut alii per sapientiam angelicam; sed sunt ibi qui ore mandant illis ut abeant, et sic abeunt, illi qui mandant sunt in potentia a Domino: causa quod feles tales sint, causa est, quia illi feles sunt, qui in cultu externo fuerunt, et moraliter vixerunt, et quoque in templis, et auscultaverunt praedicationes, sed prorsus non attenderunt ad illa quae praedicata sunt, et sic qui nullas cognitiones veri et boni hauserunt, ad quas nec audiverant, sed solum ad vocem absque cogitatione, talis quoque fuit B. Stierncrona, qui solum cantavit amen, nec attenderat ad aliquas cognitiones. </p>
