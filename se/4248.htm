<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4248</h4><p>4248. I have also sometimes observed, when angelic spirits wanted to pray from me, then to know what it was I was reading, that they stole the thought away from me by various methods, so as to hold my attention on various objects round about, so that my mental imagery would be darkened. Hence they were in light, so that they were in a greater light of understanding in proportion as I was in a lesser one, and as it were in darkness. </p>
