<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2400</h4><p>2400. About a state of fear<p>All evil spirits, whoever they are, can be brought down to humbling themselves - making themselves nothing, supplicating, acknowledging that they are filthy, and to every sentiment belonging to true faith - by means of fear. And the more people love themselves, and the world, the more readily they can be brought to acknowledging and confessing, because they fear for themselves and the loss of those things they love so much. But this state is not one of real reformation, for as soon as they relapse, they are like their former selves.<p>So other states must follow, of which there are many, so that a person, without fear or distress, may acknowledge those things that are [the essentials] of true faith. Therefore the Lord rarely allows [the use of] fears of different kinds. 1748, 24 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2400</h4><p>2400. CONCERNING THE STATE OF FEAR. <p>All evil spirits whoever they are, can be reduced to humiliation, self-annihilation, supplication, self-acknowledgment that they are filthy, and to everything that belongs to true faith, by means of fear; and the more anyone loves himself and the world, the more [easily can he be reduced] to acknowledgment and confession; because he fears for himself, and the loss of those things which he so greatly loves. But that state is not the state of his reformation, for as soon as they relapse they are like what they were before. Wherefore other states will transpire [erunt] which are numerous [plures], in order that man, when without fear and pain, or melancholy, may acknowledge those things that belong to true faith. Wherefore the Lord rarely admits fears and their species. - 1748, June 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2400 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2400. De statu timoris<p>Omnes mali spiritus, quicunque usquam sunt, redigi possunt ad humiliationem, sui annihilationem, supplicationem, agnitionem sui, quod spurci sint, et ad omnia quae verae fidei sunt, per timorem, et quo magis quis semet amat, et mundum, eo magis ad agnitionem et confessionem, quia timet sibi <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et jacturae eorum, quae tam valde amat, sed is status non est status ipsius reformationis, nam ut primum relabuntur, sibi similes sunt, ut prius fuerunt; quare alii status erunt, qui sunt plures, ut homo, dum absque timore et dolore, seu melancholia, agnoscat illa quae sunt verae fidei, quare Dominus raro timores et eorum species admittit. 1748, 24 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
