<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2802</h4><p>2802. Those they call saints, venerate and adore, both ancient and modern, cannot help anyone in the other life at all<p>It has frequently been granted me to speak with some of those they consider holy and people they worship as saints, but this I can aver, both from their own mouth and what I know from actual experience, that they are anything but saints, and cannot even in the least ways help themselves, let alone anyone else - not by prayers, nor by intercession. For in the other life, prayers for someone else are not answered, not even in the other life for oneself. In fact, neither is someone benefited by the reflection on the part of others, or on the part of saints, that they should be loved-more likely the opposite happens. This I can aver, they can help no one, not even themselves, as they told me in a loud voice, coming toward me to declare it. 1748, 12 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2802</h4><p>2802. THAT THEY WHOM THEY CALL SAINTS [sanctos] [AND] VENERATE AND ADORE AS [SUCH], AS WELL THOSE OF ANCIENT TIMES AS OF THE PRESENT DAY, CAN YIELD NO ASSISTANCE AT ALL TO ANYONE IN THE OTHER LIFE. <p>It has been often granted me to speak with certain of those whom men regard and adore as saints. But this I can testify, and from their mouth, and from those things which I know from living experience, that they are anything else than saints, and that they cannot even help themselves in the least, still less someone [else]: neither by prayers nor intercession; for in the other life [their] prayers in behalf of anyone are not granted, not indeed in the other life in behalf of themselves: yea no one is well treated by means of the reflection that someone may be loved [by the Lord] for other's sake, or for the sake of saints - rather the reverse happens. I can testify that they are able to help no one, nor themselves. This they have told me with living voice, coming to me in order to declare it. - 1748, August 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2802 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2802. Quod ii quos sanctos vocant, venerantur et adorant, tam priscos quam <sup>1</sup></p><p>hodiernos, nihil quicquam in altera vita aliquem juvare possint<p>Cum quibusdam eorum, quos sanctos putant et pro sanctis adorant homines, mihi datum est saepe loqui; sed hoc possum testari, et ex ore eorum, et ab iis quae ex viva experientia scio, quod nihil minus quam sancti sint, et quod ne quidem semet in minimis juvare possint, minus aliquem; nec precibus, nec intercessione, nam in altera vita preces pro aliquo non concessae sunt, in altera vita, ne quidem pro semet, imo nec cuiquam bene fit, per reflexionem, quod ametur aliquis propter alios, aut propter sanctos, potius contrarium fit; id testari possum, quod nullum juvare possint, nec semet, quod dixerunt mihi viva voce, venientes ad me, ut declararent illud. 1748, 12 Aug.<p>De mutatione indolis humanae in vita corporis<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I. Tafel's edition: "quam pro quod" </p>
