<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>372.人的推理和理解的能力能照弥赛亚神的美意而被削弱，甚至能从一个人或灵魂那里被夺走（也可参看326节）。我通过明显的经历获知，灵魂能几乎完全或部分地被夺去推理和理解能力，也同样能再次恢复它们；因为理解和推理能力是唯独由弥赛亚神赐下的礼物。当推理和理解能力被夺走时，灵魂就变成了魔鬼，只通过一种属世本能行动，事实上如同沉睡。当这些能力恢复时，他们只知道他们一直在睡觉。这些事被演示了好多天。在这种状态下，当理解力被夺走时，他们就照着植根于他们里面的邪恶行事，各人照着其根的性质而行，当然是违反秩序，违反天堂及其真理的。简言之，他们是不同品质的魔鬼。这种理解力从他们那里被夺走，这一点非常清楚地被指示出来，后来他们的属世本能同样被清楚指示出来。这些本能不像野兽的本能，而是从恶魔般的冲动发出的。还表明，他们不断反对属灵和属天事物，那时以为他们凭自己能做一切事。（1747年12月21日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 372</h4><p>372. The human power of reasoning and understanding can be diminished, and even taken away from a person or soul, at the good pleasure of God the Messiah [see also <a href="326.htm">326</a>]<p>From revealing Experience, I have learned that souls can be deprived almost entirely, or partially, of their reasoning and understanding abilities, and likewise have them restored again; for the understanding and reasoning faculty is a gift of God the Messiah Alone. When the reasoning and understanding abilities are taken away, the souls are devils, and they act only from a kind of natural instinct, and just as if in sleep. When these abilities are restored to them, they do not know but that they had been asleep. These facts were demonstrated over a period of many days.<p>When understanding has been taken away, they behave in that state in accordance with the evil rooted in them - each one according to the nature of their root, and to be sure, against order, against heaven, and its truths. In short, they are devils of diverse qualities.<p>It was visibly shown that it was taken away from them, as were their natural instincts afterwards. These are not like the instincts of brute animals, but issue from the diabolic impulse to strive continually against things spiritual and heavenly, and to think they have power, and do everything, from themselves. 1747, the 21st day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 372</h4><p>372. <sup>1</sup>THE RATIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL OF MAN CAN BE DIMINISHED AND ALSO TAKEN AWAY FROM MAN AND SOUL, ACCORDING TO THE GOOD PLEASURE OF GOD MESSIAH <p>I have been taught from manifest experience that the rational and intellectual of souls can be taken away from them almost wholly or in part, and in like manner be restored to them again; for the intellectual and the rational is a gift of God Messiah alone. When the rational and the intellectual is taken away, the souls are then devils and act only from a certain natural instinct, and indeed as if in sleep; when it is restored, they know no otherwise than that they have been in sleep. These things were shown for many days. In that state, when the intellectual has been taken away, they act according to their inrooted evil, each one according to the quality of the root, and indeed contrary to order in contrary to heaven and its truths; in a word, they are devils of diverse quality. That this intellectual was taken away from them was very clearly shown, and afterwards their natural instincts, which are not like the instincts of brutes, but from something diabolical. It was also shown that they continually act against spiritual and celestial things, and they then suppose that they are able from themselves to do all things. 1747, Dec. <a href="../se/326.htm">326</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the margin: "See earlier 326." However, there is some doubt whether the handwriting here is Swedenborg's. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 372 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>372. Quod rationale ac intellectuale hominis diminui, et quoque auferri homini ac animae possit, secundum beneplacitum Dei Messiae <sup>1</sup></p><p>Ab Experientia manifesta edoctus sum, quod animabus possit adimi fere quoad totum, et ad partem, eorum rationale et intellectuale, ac iis similiter restitui, nam intellectuale et rationale est donum Solius Dei Messiae; quum rationale et intellectuale aufertur, tunc animae sunt diaboli, et solum ex instinctu quodam naturali agunt, et quidem sicut in somno; dum iis restituitur, sciunt non aliter, quam quod in somno fuerint, haec per plures dies ostensa sunt; in statu isto, dum intellectuale ablatum est, agunt secundum radicale eorum malum, quilibet secundum qualitatem radicis, et quidem contra ordinem, contra coelum, et ejus veritates, verbo sunt diaboli diversa qualitate; quod ablatum iis sit, conspicue ostensum est, et eorum naturales instinctus postea, qui non sunt sicut brutorum instinctus, sed ex diabolico, quod continue agant contra spiritualia, et coelestia, ac putent se tunc omnia ex se posse, et agere. 1747, die 21 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;ad sinistrum capitis manu B.
