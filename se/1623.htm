<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1623</h4><p>1623. How hardening [of the heart] appears<p>We read here and there that "the heart was hardened." A hardening does actually appear, is even felt - not of course, in the heart, because the heart symbolizes everything pertaining to the feelings. So it appears where principles lodge, and that is in the brain. When souls after their decease appear in the world of spirits, the brains of some appear as if they had hardened, as you may see described elsewhere [<a href="862.htm">862</a>, <a href="958.htm">958</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>], so that the outermost crust is almost hard, or glued tight. This is viewed by a spiritual mental image, and thus shown clearly. This hard crust must be softened. Such is the case in the absence of belief.<p>I was enabled to experience this same phenomenon, that is, of feeling hard spots at the left side of the brain, like rather large, hard lumps, which were the seat of a blunt, dull pain. I was told that these hard spots showed that there are still elements at variance with true belief. From this it is apparent that a hardness is actually produced in the organic substances when belief is lacking, and the greater the hardening, the less of conscience there is. Therefore, in those who have nothing of conscience, which condition shows itself in the form of anxieties, their brain after their decease seems to be hardened on the very outside. This must first soften, and this takes place along with excruciating pain. 1748, 21 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1623</h4><p>1623. HOW INDURATION APPEARS. <p>We read in a great many places that the heart is hardened; this hardening is also manifestly apparent, yea, it is felt, not indeed in the [literal] heart, for the heart signifies what pertains to the affections. It takes place, therefore, where first principles exist, to wit, in the brain. When the souls of the recently deceased appear after death in the world of spirits, the brains of some of them seem to be hardened, like things that you see elsewhere, so that the exterior or crustal portion is, as it were, hard and conglutinated. This is seen by a spiritual idea, and thus plainly exhibited, as also its softening. Thus it is without faith. Something similar it was given me to experience, namely, a hardness in the left region of the cerebrum, as if occasioned by somewhat large and hard lumps which were the seat of an obscure dull pain, and I was informed that it was thence perceived, namely, from these hardenings, that there yet remained something not belonging to true faith. It appears hence that an actual hardness does exist in the organicals [of the body] when faith is wanting, and that the greater the obduration, the less the conscience, so that those who have no conscience, manifesting itself in anxieties, seem to have their brain, after death, externally hardened, which was formerly soft, and this is attended with pains and torture. - 1748, March 21. </p>
