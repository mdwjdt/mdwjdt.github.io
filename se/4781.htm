<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4781</h4><p>4781. About our earth, why the Lord was born there<p>Continuation. There was a conversation about why the Lord was born on this earth and not on some other, [and it was said] that the reason was that the doctrine made known from heaven could be spread abroad through the whole world and remains for thousands of years. This is because on this earth since ancient times such things have been entrusted to writing and after this to type, and it is possible to spread these abroad through the whole globe and for them to remain. This is possible because there are such forms of communication and permanence on this earth and not elsewhere. Elsewhere the inhabitants are divided into tribes, families, and households, and do not know how to put the things that they know into writing, nor how to share them with others. Besides this, it is also the case that when the heavenly doctrine about the Lord is known on one earth, the rest can know about it when they become spirits and angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4781</h4><p>4781. CONCERNING OUR EARTH - WHY THEY LORD WAS BORN THERE.<p>Continuation. There was a talk concerning the Lord, why He was born in this earth and not in some other; and [it was seen] that the reason was, because, in this earth, doctrine communicated from heaven, could be propagated throughout the whole world, and remain for thousands of years; for, in this earth, from ancient times, such things have been committed to writings, and, afterward, to types, and these can be spread throughout the whole world, and also remain; for such communications and travellings exist in this earth, and not elsewhere; for, elsewhere, the inhabitants are distinguished into nations, families and houses, and do not know how to commit to writings the thing which they know, nor how to communicate with all. Besides, also, when the heavenly doctrine concerning the Lord is known in one earth, the rest are thus able to know it, when they become spirits and angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4781 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4781. De Tellure nostra cur ibi Dominus natus<p>Continuatio. Loquela fuit de Domino cur natus in hac tellure, et non in alia aliqua, et quod causa esset, quia in hac tellure doctrina vulgata e coelo posset propagari per universum orbem, et permanere in millia annorum, nam in hac tellure ab antiquis temporibus talia mandata sunt chartis, et dein typis, et illa per universum orbem propagari possunt, et quoque permanere, nam communicationes tales dantur in hac tellure, et perennationes, et non alibi; nam alibi sunt incolae distinctae in gentes, familias et domos, et nesciunt mandare chartis quae sciunt, nec communicare cum omnibus. Praeterea etiam cum in una tellure doctrina coelestis de Domino nota est, possunt sic reliqui scire cum spiritus et angeli fiunt. </p>
