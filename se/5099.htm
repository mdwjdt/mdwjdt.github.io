<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5099</h4><p>5099. About those who are raised from the dead, and who in the last moments had professed faith [Brahe <sup>1</sup>]<p>He was executed at 10 a.m. and was seen and spoke with me at 10 p.m., thus 12 hours later, and then almost continually for several days. After two days he began to return to his previous state of life, which had been one of loving worldly things, and after three days he became just as he had been in the world and was carried into the evils that he had soaked up in the world.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Count Magnus Frederic Brahe had abetted Queen Louisa Ulrica in her attempts to subvert the constitution of Sweden. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5099</h4><p>5099. CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE RESUSCITATED FROM THE DEAD, AND WHO IN THEIR LAST MOMENTS PROFESSED FAITH ([ERIK] BRAHE).<p>He was executed at the tenth hour before noon; and I saw him, and we spoke together, at the tenth hour, in the afternoon, thus twelve hours afterwards; and, after that, for several days almost continually. After two days, he began to return to his former state of life, which was to love worldly things; and, after three days, he became just as he previously was in the world, and betook himself to the evils which he had imbibed in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5099 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5099. De illis qui resuscitantur a mortuis, et qui in ultimis confessi fidem (Brahe)<p>Ille capite mulctatus est hora decima ante meridiem, ac visus est, et mecum loquutus hora decima post meridiem, ita post 12 horas, et dein per aliquot dies paene continuo; post biduum incepit redire ad priorem suae vitae statum, qui fuit amare mundana, et post triduum fiebat sicut fuit prius in mundo, et ferebatur in mala, quae imbuerat in mundo. </p>
