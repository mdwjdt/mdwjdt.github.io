<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2367</h4><p>2367. and in fact, a finely organic one, which is the subject of the thinking. A spirit therefore also speaks, as they have with me now for several years, sometimes almost continually by day, aloud and clearly, just as in human society, in a voice heard by me, but not by my neighbors or others near me. Spirits have other things pertaining to the body, discussed elsewhere [<a href="2355.htm">2355</a>]. It was added that in the human body it is the spirit that thinks, that wills, that desires, that lives, etc. No one, therefore, who wishes to be discerning can deny that the spirit, because it is in a body, is a substance, and in a place. It is not outside of the person, but in the person's body, even if thought from the spirit goes out beyond the person, having effects even far off, such as speech, light, sight, which therefore cannot be said to be in a place, but from the spirit, which is in a place. 1748, 20 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2367</h4><p>2367. Since a spirit is a substance, and indeed a subtle organism, that is, the subject of thought, a spirit therefore also speaks; as has been the case with me now for some years, sometimes almost continually in the daytime, just as in human society, with a living and clear voice, which, though audible to me, was not so to my neighbors or others near me. Spirits have other things which are in the body, concerning which [I have treated] elsewhere. It is added that it is the spirit in the human body which thinks, which wills, which desires, which sees, etc.; wherefore, by no one who wishes to understand, can it be denied that the spirit, because in the body, is a substance, and in a place. It is not outside of a man, but in the body of man; although thought [proceeding] from the spirit diffuses itself outside thereof, yea, produces its effect at a distance, like speech, light, sight. Wherefore thought [ea] cannot be said to be in place, but from the spirit which is in place. - 1748, June 20. </p>
