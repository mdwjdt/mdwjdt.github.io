<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1593</h4><p>1593. When a spirit is carried up into heaven, then it is as if he were taken away from [other] spirits<p>Distance in the spiritual world is proportionate to inward qualities, for the more inward spirits are, the more distant they are; but apparent distance is another matter. However, when a spirit is carried up into heaven, then he is thought to have disappeared entirely by [other] spirits, even though [those carried up] are present and leading.<p>As to my inward parts, I was to a degree in heaven, as I realized because of the angels' choruses, which, of course, I did not understand, but I did realize that my inward parts were in heaven. I then heard spirits asking after me, and saying, "He is not here," not knowing where I was. They were, however, speaking by material mental images, such as pertain to the memory of personal matters, thus by voices. So I realized that I was very closely present, even [hearing] <sup>1</sup>their conversation, which they did not know.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See the index at Externa and Interiora. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1593</h4><p>1593. THAT A SPIRIT WHEN TAKEN UP INTO HEAVEN IS TAKEN AWAY, AS IT WERE, FROM [OTHER] SPIRITS. <p>Distance, in the spiritual world, exists according to interior states, as the more interior spirits are [in comparison with others] the more distant they are; apparent distance is another thing. When spirits are taken up into heaven they seemingly disappear altogether from [other] spirits, although they are in fact present to them, and lead them. I was, in my interiors, in some small degree in heaven, which I perceived from the angelic choirs. And though I did not understand these [choral exercises], yet I perceived that my interiors were in heaven. I then heard spirits inquiring for me, and saying, "He is not here," - being ignorant where I was. During this time they spoke from material ideas, such as belong to the memory of material things [particularium] thus vocally; and thus [it was shown] that I might be intimately present, even in their speech, and yet they not know it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1593 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1593. Quando spiritus in coelum aufertur, quod tunc a spiritibus quasi auferatur<p>Quod distantia in spirituali mundo se habeat sicut interiora [constat], quo enim interiores eo magis distant; sed aliud est distantiae apparentia. <sup>1</sup></p><p>Cum autem spiritus in coelum aufertur, tunc putatur prorsus disparere a spiritibus, tametsi [tales] praesentes sint, et eos ducunt; interioribus meis paulum eram in coelo, quod percepi ex angelorum choris, quos quidem non intellexi, sed percepi, quod interiora mea in coelo essent; tunc audivi spiritus, me quaerentes, dicentesque quod "non hic est," nescientes ubinam essem <sup>2</sup></p><p>, cum tamen loquebantur ideis materialibus, quales sunt memoriae particularium, ita vocibus; et sic [percepi] quod usque adessem proxime, etiam in eorum loquela, quod nesciebant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has apparentes ut videtur<p>2.&nbsp;In the Manuscript esset in essem emendatum </p>
