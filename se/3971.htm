<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3971</h4><p>3971. What they were like appeared, as they sat mounted on a large and noble black horse, but which horse was made of ebony or marble, its head, neck and frontal parts devoid of life. Later its hind parts came to view, which were enlarged, and they were animate, but full of dung. Such are they who are without direction. 1748, 13 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3971</h4><p>3971. It was seen of what quality they were from their sitting upon a black horse, apparently a large and generous animal, but of an ebony or marble aspect, and lifeless as to his head, neck, and front parts; his hinder parts were afterwards seen, which were of broad dimensions, and animated, but full of excrements. Such are they who are thus indeterminate in their character. - 1748, November 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3971 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3971. Visi quales, quod insidentes equo nigro magno et generoso, sed qui equus erat ebenus vel marmoreus, absque vita, quoad caput, collum, et anteriora ejus; visa postea ejus posteriora , quae lata facta, et ea erant animata, sed plena excrementis; tales sunt qui indeterminati sunt. 1748, 13 Nov. </p>
