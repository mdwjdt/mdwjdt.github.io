<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4693</h4><p>4693. About the simple and uneducated in the other life<p>Heaven and hell<p>Eliezer och min moster som hete Schonstrom <sup>1</sup><p>In heaven, those who have been devoted to the truths of faith and at the same time lived according to them shine more than the others, for deeper knowledge of truth and good come into the light there and are in it. But those who have deeper knowledge and have a life of evil are in hell, for the deeper knowledge they had did not go into life because it did not go into the will and thus become goodness. Those who have acquired knowledge and confirmed themselves against the truths of faith in favor of nature are in hell because inwardly they have closed to themselves the way to the light. But for those who have lived according to truths, the way to light from the Lord has been opened.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Eliezer and my maternal aunt named Schonstrom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4693</h4><p>4693. CONCERNING THE SIMPLE AND UNLEARNED IN THE OTHER LIFE. HEAVEN AND HELL. ELIEZER [SWEDBERG <sup>1</sup>] AND MY MATERNAL AUNT, WHO WAS MARRIED TO SCHONSTROM.<p>Those in heaven who shine above the rest, are those who have studied the truths of faith, and at the same time have lived according to them; for the knowledges of truth and good enter into light there, and are in the light. But they who are in knowledges, and in a life of evil, are in hell; for knowledges, with them, have not entered the life, because they have not entered the will, and thus produced good. They who are in scientifics, and have confirmed themselves against the truths of faith in favor of nature, are in hell, because they have interiorly closed against themselves the way to light. To them, however, who have lived according to truths, the way to light is opened by the Lord.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;A younger brother of Emanuel Swedenborg's. He died 1717. </p>
