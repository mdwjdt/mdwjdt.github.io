<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>396.人性与树并果实的一个比较。世界上的事物无不是天上事物的一个代表，可以说是属灵事物的一个效果。凡在植物界和动物界的所有事物，都是属灵和天上事物的代表，可以说是效果；事实上，它们具有无数种类。因为属世事物若不通过属灵事物，永远不可能存在，也不可能持续存在，这一事实能以无数方式来证明。在此我只证明人性是如何在人成长的过程中在他里面形成的。这一点可在树及其果实中清楚看出来，如苹果和其它水果。表层或果皮是果实内在部分或果仁的母体。所有内在部分都是通过表层和从表层延伸的纤维得以形成的；味道则与快乐有关。内在部分通过分支于各个方向的纤维从表层得以形成后，外壳就被分开（如与杏仁分开），而果仁则保留下来。人类发展的过程也是这样：它从认知或高等知识，因而从理性事物开始，由此获得一种性质，这种性质就像以这种方式成形的果仁。从果仁的味道明显看出汁或液，也就是此人的生命是什么样。这些事是当着天使和灵人的面写的。（1747年12月25日）<p>人类的许多本性或人类灵魂因在很大程度上就像未成熟或腐烂的果实，有一种恶臭味，所以只能被比作那些需要在好土里重新改造或生长的果实。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 396</h4><p>396. A comparison of character with trees and fruits<p>Nothing exists in the world that is not a portrayal of what is heavenly, and a result as it were of what is spiritual<p>All things whatsoever that are in the vegetable and in the animate kingdom, are portrayals and as it were results of things spiritual and heavenly, and in fact, in a countless variety. For earthly things could never have come forth nor continued, except from spiritual ones, a fact that can be demonstrated in countless ways. Here I will speak only of how character develops in a person growing up. This is seen imaged in trees and their fruits, such as apples and others: the surface or covering is the mother of the fruit in the inward parts or cores; through the surface and the fibers reaching in from it, all the inward parts are developed. The flavor images pleasantness [of character].<p>After the inward parts have developed from the surface, by means of fibers branching in from all sides, then the hard coverings are separated - as with an almond - and the kernels remain.<p>So in the comparable process of human development: it commences from higher knowledge, thus from matters of the intellect, whereby character is acquired, which is like the kernel so formed. From the flavor of the kernel it is evident what the juice or sap, that is, the life of the person, had been like. These things were written in the presence of angels and spirits. 1747, the 25th day of December.<p>Because many human characters, or souls, resemble unripe or rotten fruits, having a stinking odor, therefore they cannot be compared to anything but those fruits which must develop anew in good ground. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph seems to be deleted in the original. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 396</h4><p>396. A COMPARISON OF [MAN'S] NATURE WITH TREES AND FRUITS. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF CELESTIAL THINGS, AND, AS IT WERE, AN EFFECT OF SPIRITUAL THINGS <p>All things whatsoever in the vegetable kingdom and in the animal kingdom, are the representations, and, as it were, the effects of spiritual and celestial things, and indeed in innumerable variety; for natural things could never exist, nor thus subsist, except from things spiritual, which can be demonstrated by innumerable considerations: here it shall only be demonstrated how the nature of man is formed in him while he is growing up. <sup>1</sup>This is clearly seen in trees and their fruits, as in apples and other fruits. The surface or skin is the mother of the interiors of the fruit or of the kernels. By means of the surface, and the fibers extended therefrom, all the interiors are formed; the flavor relates to delight. After the interiors have been formed from the surface by means of the fibers ramified on every side, then the shells are separated - as in almonds - and the kernels remain. This is in the likeness of those things that take place in the formation of man from cognitions, thus from intellectual things, whence is derived a nature which is the resemblance of the kernel formed in this manner; from the flavor of the kernel, it is evident of what quality the sap or life has been. These things have been written in the presence of angels and spirits. 1747, Dec. 25. <p>Because natures or human souls are for the most part like immature and sour fruit, the odor of which is fetid, they therefore cannot be otherwise compared than to what needs to be reformed in good ground. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Crescit: the Latin text has nescit ("he is ignorant"), but the reading is doubtful. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 396 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>396. Quaecunque in regno vegetabili, et in animali sunt, repraesentationes et quasi effectus sunt spiritualium et coelestium, et quidem in innumerabili varietate, nam naturalia nusquam existere potuerunt, ita nec subsistere nisi a spiritualibus, quod innumeris potest demonstrari; hic solum quomodo indoles formatur in homine dum venit <sup>1</sup></p><p>, id conspicitur in arboribus, earumque fructibus, sicut in pomis, aliisque, superficies seu cortex est mater fructus interiorum, seu nucleorum, per superficies et inde extensas fibras, formantur omnia interiora, sapor refert jucunditatem; postquam interiora a superficie per fibras undequaque ramificatas formata sunt, tunc ut in amygdalis separantur crustae, et remanent nuclei, ad similitudinem eorum quae fiunt in hominis formatione a cognitionibus, sic ab intellectualibus, inde indoles trahitur, quae est instar nuclei ita formati, ex nuclei sapore constat qualis succus seu vita fuerit. Haec in praesentia angelorum et spirituum scripta sunt. 1747, die 25 Dec.<p>Quia indoles seu animae humanae pleraeque sunt similes immaturis et tetris fructibus, quorum odor est putidus, ideo non possunt aliter assimilari ac quod reformari debeant in bona terra. <sup>2</sup></p><p>Comparatio indolis cum arboribus et fructibus Quod nihil in mundo detur, quod non est repraesentatio coelestium, et quasi effectus spiritualium.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;hoc est crescit<p>2.&nbsp;haec paragraphus ob lineas fortiores potius deleta videtur </p>
