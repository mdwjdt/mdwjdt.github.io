<p>559.他们以这种方式走路，他们的脸朝前，脸上戴着一个宽松的遮盖物，因为他们几乎跳跃前行，在奔行中不断抬起身体，因此站起来。但当他们向前迈步时，会用手稍加协助，以这种方式保持直立。这一切事都展示给我了，而且被他们的灵人看到并证实了；除了他们的天使允许他们所说的话外，他们什么也不敢说。（1748年1月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 559</h4><p>559. When they walk, they keep their face directed frontwards, wearing a spacious covering above it, and because they are almost jumping along, repeatedly lifting themselves up in their course, they do step upon their feet. When they take steps forward, they help themselves a little with their hands, thus raising themselves up. All these things were shown to me, and were seen and confirmed by their spirits, who do not dare to say anything but what their angels allow them to say. 1748, the 26th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 559</h4><p>559. They walk in such a manner that they keep their face directed towards things in front, with a loose covering drawn over it, and because they almost spring by frequently raising themselves in their glide, they thus stand on their feet. But as they move forward a step they assist themselves in some way by their hands, and in this manner keep themselves erect. All these things were shown me, and they were also seen and confirmed by their spirits, who dare say nothing but what is granted them by their angels to speak. 1748, Jan. 26. </p>
