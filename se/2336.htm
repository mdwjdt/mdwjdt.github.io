<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2336</h4><p>2336. However, they are not always located according to their seat in the grand body, for evil spirits swollen with self-love are for the most part high up, overhead to the front, because their attitude brings them up there. But I do not yet know the reason for this difference. At the back are mostly those who like to command, for I was told that these kinds so to speak hang on a person's back. Then they also change locations, as when those who have been below for a long time appear above; but these are at length led back to a different place assigned to them, like the foul gaseous vapors in our body that likewise escape from the stomach and other parts of the body to the provinces of the head, infesting them, but are nevertheless cast down. Nor are those spirits prevented from doing so, for a reason that can be recognized by a symbolic image derived from comparable effects in the human body, especially in a body sick with some disease - namely, that when it returns to health, everything comes back into balance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2336</h4><p>2336. (Still they do not always present themselves according to situation in the Grand Man, for evil spirits who are inflated with self-love are very often on high above the head in front, because their mind [animus] carries them thither. But I do not yet know the reason of this difference. At the back, very much of the time, are such as wish to command, for it was told me that such adhere as it were to the back of man. Then also they change localities, so that those who have been long beneath are raised up above, but such at length are brought back to another place appointed for them. They are like the foul and turgid exhalations in our body that also flow [enatant] from the stomach and other parts of the body to the provinces of the head, and infest them, but yet are hence cast out, and are not thence debarred, from such a cause as may be known, by an idea of representation, from similar things in the human body, especially in the body when affected with any disease, that, when it returns to health, an equilibrium of everything occurs.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2336 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2336. Usque tamen non semper se habent secundum situm in corpore maximo, nam mali spiritus qui amore sui tumidi sunt, ut plurimum in alto sunt, supra caput antrorsum, quia animus eorum, illuc eos evehit; sed causam hujus discriminis adhuc non novi: a tergo ut plurimum sunt, qui imperare volunt, nam dictum mihi, quod tales tergo hominis quasi adhaerent. Tum quoque mutant loca, ut qui <sup>1</sup></p><p>infra diu, supra sistantur; sed tales tandem ad locum alium et iis designatum tandem reducuntur, sunt quasi in corpore nostro halitus tetri et inflati, qui quoque e ventriculo aliisque partibus corporis <sup>2</sup></p><p>enatant ad capitis provincias, et eas infestant, sed usque inde dejiciuntur; nec inde arcentur, ex causa tali, quae cognosci potest, per repraesentationis ideam, ex similibus in corpore humano: cumprimis in corpore affecto aliquo morbo, quod dum ad sanitatem redit, fit omnium aequilibrium.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;ms quae sed vide indicem ad Locus<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has corporis corporis </p>
