<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1158</h4><p>1158. The other spirit, who behaved inconspicuously and was busy [<a href="1152.htm">1152-1155</a>], was also shown to me. He was dressed in sky blue. His face indeed resembled a human face, but it was wicked. The power to remember further particulars, he has wrested from me, perhaps because they are not worthy of mention. 1748, 4 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1158</h4><p>1158. Another who acted inconspicuously and assiduously was also shown me. He was dressed in azure. His face indeed seemed human, but it was wicked. He snatched away other things that I remembered perhaps because they were not worth mentioning. 1748, Mar. 4. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Written as a heading between nos. 1158 and 1159, and then crossed out: "THAT THE SPIRITUAL ARE AVERSE TO BUTTER, BUT NOT SO TO MILK." </p>

Alter qui inconspicue agebat, et industrius quoque mihi ostensus est, erat habitu coeruleo, facie quidem humanae simili, sed scelesta, caetera reminisci {a}, is surripit, forte quia non memoratu dignum. 1748, 4 Martius. </p>
