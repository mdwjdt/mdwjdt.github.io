<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>489.关于天使和谐的赞美诗。今天，我听见众多内层天堂的天使们齐声作了一首赞美诗，并且听得清清楚楚。只是我听不懂他们在说什么，因为他们是天使；我周围的灵人也不明白。我只能出于某种内在情感的变化知道这首赞美诗里面有某种天上的东西。天使们清楚理解这些赞美诗。对我来说，它们就像连续的童声或婴儿声，类似长笛的声音。他们在一个千变万化的天堂漩涡中，一起说并代表同一件事。后来我得知他们所说的话，即：他们通过赞美诗在我们救主的头上形成了一顶嵌有钻石的金王冠，这事是通过天堂的代表和不同的观念实现的；这些观念是人类言语的开端，但不为灵人或世人理解；奇妙的是，许多人一起说并代表了这一点。没有一个人去指挥另一个人，以致没有人引导唱诗班，而是所有人一起彼此引导；事实上，人数越多，这种事就越容易做到；因为他们都受弥赛亚神掌管。这种和谐一致对世人来说，是不可思议的；然而，属灵和属天的和谐就具有这种性质。此外，天使会流动并被带进千变万化的属灵和属天漩涡中。我也被允许进入我能跟得上的一些更基本的漩涡中。不过，有人若想凭自己行动，指挥其他人，不肯让自己被引导，就绝无可能加入他们，除非强制。灵魂逐渐被带入这类和谐一致中，以便他们最终能生活在天使们中间。（1748年1月18日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 489</h4><p>489. About the harmonious hymns of the angels<p>Today I heard angels of the inward heaven, <sup>1</sup>very many of them in concert, composing a hymn, which was clearly audible to my hearing. What they were saying I could not understand, because they were angels; nor were the spirits around me able to understand what it was. Only from a certain variation of my inward feeling, I was able to learn that what is heavenly was in it. The angels clearly understood those hymns, which to me were just like a continuous childlike sound, resembling the sound of a flute. They were, to be sure, in a heavenly gyre made up of very many, saying and depicting the same thing at the same time.<p>Afterwards I was informed what they had said, namely, that by their hymns they had fashioned a golden crown set with diamonds around the Head of our Savior, which was done as well by heavenly displays as by distinct mental images, which are the beginnings of human words, unintelligible to spirit or man; and what is amazing, many say and portray this simultaneously, and one does not command the other in a way that anyone is directing the chorus, but all are mutually leading each other at the same time - in fact the more there are, the more easily it goes. For they are all ruled by God the Messiah.<p>That harmony is unbelievable to a person on earth, yet spiritual and heavenly harmony is of this nature. Moreover, the angels stream into and are turned about in spiritual and heavenly gyres in countless varying patterns. Some of the more basic ones I myself have been let into and was able to follow; but any who try to act on their own, to command the rest, unwilling to let themselves be led, cannot possibly join in except under coercion. Souls are brought gradually into harmony and unanimity of these kinds, so that they are finally able to live among angels. 1748, the 18th day of January.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See footnote number 3 at 262. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 489</h4><p>489. CONCERNING THE HARMONIC HYMNS OF THE ANGELS <p>Today, I heard angels of the interior heaven, of whom there were very many in consociation, forming a hymn which was plainly audible to me, but I could not understand what they were saying because they were angels; neither could the spirits who were about me perceive what it was. I could only recognize from a certain variety of interior affection, that there was something heavenly in it. The angels perceived those hymns clearly. To me, they were like a continuous infantile sound, resembling that of a flute: and they were in a heavenly gyre which very many form, and they say and represent the same thing together. I was afterwards informed what they had been saying, namely, that by their hymns they had been forming a golden crown with diadems about the head of our Savior, which was effected both by means of heavenly representations, and by distinct ideas which are the beginnings of human words but intelligible to no spirit or man; and what is wonderful, very many say and represent this together. Nor does one command another, so that no one leads the choir, but all together lead each other mutually, and indeed the more there are, so much the more easily is this done; because all are governed by God Messiah, that harmony is incredible to man, nevertheless such is the nature of spiritual and celestial harmony. Moreover, they flow and are carried round into spiritual and celestial gyres which are of innumerable variety. I was also admitted into certain grosser gyres which I could follow. <sup>1</sup>But he who wants to act from himself and to command the others, and is unwilling to suffer himself to be led, can by no means be among them, except compulsorily. Into such harmonies and agreements are souls reduced by degrees, so that at length they can be among the angels <sup>2</sup>1748, Jan. 18. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Crossed out: "but I am not yet [admitted] into such gyres, because I am a man; if I were admitted nothing could..." <p>2.&nbsp;Crossed out: "Otherwise, they are rejected." </p>
