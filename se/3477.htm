<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3477</h4><p>3477. From this it follows that some even induce themselves to reason from time and space concerning the creation of the universe, thus concerning God, as to what He had been doing before the creation of the universe. And because they have no other notion than a temporal one, some say that at that time He thought about how He would create the universe and the things that are in it, how He would foresee and provide all things down to the least. From this they infer absurdities - and the utterly corporeal-minded the absurdity that God had come into existence together with the universe, thus that nature is God, or that God came forth from nature; besides others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3477</h4><p>3477. Hence it is that some engage themselves in reasoning from time concerning the creation of the world, and thus concerning God, what he did prior to the creation of the world; and because they have no other notion than that of time, some say that he was then thinking how he should create the world, and the things that are in it, and how he should foresee and provide for everything in particular. Thus they draw absurd conclusions, and those of them that are altogether corporeal [infer] that God began to exist with the world, thus that nature is God, or that God existed from nature; besides other things [of the same kind]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3477 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3477. Exinde fluit, quod quidam etiam inducunt sibi ratiocinari ex tempore de mundi creatione, et sic de Deo, quid fecerit ante creationem mundi, et quia non aliam notionem habent quam temporis, quidam dicunt tunc cogitavisse quomodo crearet mundum, et similia quae in mundo, quomodo praevideret et provideret omnia et singula; inde absurditates deducunt, et eam, qui corporei prorsus sunt, quod Deus exstiterit cum mundo, sic naturam esse Deum, seu Deum exstitisse ex natura; praeter alia. </p>
