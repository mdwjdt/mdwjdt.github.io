<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6073</h4><p>6073. A cincture around the neck, halsduk <sup>1</sup><p>There was a certain one who diligently read the Word in his youth, but later put it out of mind because he did not understand it, saying to himself that moral or natural theology was a better teacher, on which account he slipped into this belief and abandoned the Word. He went to angels, and the angels told him what use the Word performed, that moral life separate from theological life did nothing [truly] useful, did not purify from evils, and by itself contributed nothing to eternal life. Listening, he assented. On this account he was given a neckband by the angels, a halsduk hwit. <sup>2</sup>Gladdened by this he returned home. But this halsduk made it almost impossible to see. Asked the reason, it was said it was because it ruptured the link between what is heavenly and what is moral, and consequently that with this neckband he could not see, but without it [he could]; because those things that pertain to heaven and the Church form the head, and moral and earthly things form the body, and the neck makes the connection. From this it was evident what the neck symbolizes, and what it's covering.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "cravat"<br><br>2.&nbsp;Swedish for "white cravat" </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6073</h4><p>6073. THE NECK-BAND (NECKTIE <sup>1</sup>). <p>There was a certain one, who, in his youth, had read the Word diligently, but afterwards, because he did not understand it, banished it from the mind, saying to himself that moral or natural theology is a, better teacher. Wherefore, he fell into that opinion, and forsook the Word. He came to angels and the angels said, What is the use of the Word and that moral life apart from theological life, does not effect any use, does not purify from evils, and by itself does not conduce to life eternal. He, on hearing this, assented; wherefore a neckband was given him by the angels - a white neck-tie; <sup>2</sup>delighted with which, he returned home. But that necktie made him almost unable to see. The cause was inquired into; and it was stated that it was because he had burst asunder the bond between heavenly and moral things, and that, consequently, with that band on, he was not able to see, but only without it; because those things which are of heaven and the church constitute the head; and moral and natural things constitute the body; and the neck constitutes their conjunction. Hence was manifest what the neck signifies, and what that which clothes it. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish, halsduk. <p>2.&nbsp;Swedish, halsduk hvit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6073 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6073. Cinctura colli, halsduk <sup>1</sup></p><p>Erat quidam qui in juventute sua diligenter legerat Verbum, at postea quia non intellexit illud, ex animo rejecit illud, dicendo secum quod theologia moralis seu naturalis doceat melius, quare in eam opinionem lapsus est, et reliquit Verbum, ille venit ad angelos, et angeli dixerunt, quem usum praestaret Verbum, quod moralis vita absque vita theologica non faceret aliquem usum, non purificaret a malis, et sola non conduceret ad vitam aeternam, ille audiens assensit, quare data est ei ab angelis cinctura colli, halsduk hwit, <sup>2</sup></p><p>quo gavisus rediit domum, sed ille halsduk faciebat ut vix videre posset, quaesita causa erat, dictum est quia vinculum inter coelestia et moralia perruperet, et sic quod cum illa cinctura non posset videre, sed absque illa, quia illa quae coeli et Ecclesiae sunt faciunt caput, et moralia ac naturalia faciunt corpus, ac collum facit conjunctionem; inde patuit quid significat collum, et quid ejus velamentum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;= focale seu fascia collaris virorum (vox suecica)<p>2.&nbsp;= album (vox suecica) </p>
