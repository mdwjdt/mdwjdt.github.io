<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4032</h4><p>4032. Twice, also, there occupied the upper parts of my forehead, toward the top of my nose, and my whole forehead together with the upper part of my nose, the heat of a bath so intense, that it was as if I were in the bath. This heat I perceived so entirely, that I was surprised, and I was told that such is the heat of those who reside there, and that there are also little children among them, but little ones of a few years. I realized that the woman seen in the bath, who became a cloud and disappeared, spoken of earlier [<a href="4024.htm">4024</a>], symbolized those women who stole in with treacherous intent, who were the mucus of the nostrils spoken of, and who were therefore cast out like mucus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4032</h4><p>4032. On two occasions also the heat of a bath, as great as if I actually had been immersed in one, pervaded the upper region of my forehead towards the origins of the nose, and thus over the whole forehead and the higher part of the nose, which heat I perceived so distinctly as to wonder at it. It was said to me that such is the heat of those who reside there, and that there are infants also among them, but infants of some years. It was perceived that the woman seen in the bath, who disappeared in the form of a cloud, of whom I spoke above, signified those who covertly insinuate themselves, and who are the mucus of the nostrils before mentioned, and who were therefore driven away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4032 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4032. Bis quoque frontis meae superiora, versus principia nasi, et totam frontem cum nasi superiori, calor balnei ita magnus occupabat, sicut essem in balneo, quem calorem percepi ita prorsus, quod miratus, mihi dicebatur, quod talis iis calor sit, qui ibi; et quod infantes quoque penes eas sint; sed infantes aliquot annorum; perceptum quod faemina visa in balneo, quae facta nubes, disparuit, de qua prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4032/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4024" target=_top>4024</a>], significaret eas quae se insidiose insinuarent, quae mucus narium essent, de quibus quae ideo ut mucus expulsae sunt. </p>
