<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3952</h4><p>3952. A woman appeared to me, stretching out her hand, wishing to stroke my cheek. As I wondered what this could mean, I was told that such a woman had appeared to him at times, when his eyes were closed, who stroked his cheek, whose hand was lovely, and I spoke with angelic spirits about her, who told that such women are what were called Pallases - not Minervas, but Pallases - and that they were spirits of that time, and of times more ancient, who delighted in mental imagery, like spirits, who gave themselves up to thinking, as is well known concerning the Stoics, and others, for in times gone by they could think much better without philosophy, and so were able to associate somewhat with spirits. Those spirits were delighted with Aristotle, because he thought rightly, for which reason such a woman was sometimes portrayed to him, who stroked his cheeks. The woman was a portrayal by male spirits who were around him and had him as their medium. So the woman was not a spirit, but was the portrayal of a woman, such as I had experienced earlier [<a href="3856.htm">3856</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3952</h4><p>3952. A woman appeared to me and extended her hand, as if to stroke my cheek, and when I wondered what could be meant thereby, it was said that such a woman, having a beautiful hand sometimes appeared to him [during his life] when his eyes were closed, who would stroke his cheek; and speaking with the angels respecting her, they said that such were those who were called Pallases - not Minervas, but Pallases - and that they were spirits of that and of more ancient times, who, as spirits, were delighted with ideas, and indulged in thoughts, as is well known in respect to the Stoics and others; for formerly they could think much better without philosophy [than with it], so that they in a certain way mingled with spirits. Such spirits were delighted with Aristotle from his thinking justly, wherefore there was sometimes represented to him such a woman stroking his cheek. The woman was a representation [effected] by male spirits who were about him and had possession of him as a subject, so that the woman was not a spirit, but the representation of a woman, as I myself just before experienced. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3952 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3952. Visa mihi mulier quae exporrigebat manum, volens genam meam mulcere, miratus, quid significaret, dictum quod visa ei quandoque, clausis oculis talis faemina, quae mulceret ejus genas, cujus manus pulchra, et cum angelicis spiritibus de ea loquutus, qui dixerunt, quod tales sunt, quae vocatae Pallades, non Minervae, sed Pallades; et quod fuerint spiritus istius temporis et ab antiquioribus, qui delectati ideis, sicut spiritus, et indulserint cogitationibus, ut de Stoicis, et caeteris notum est, quia olim absque philosophia multo melius cogitare potuerunt, sic ut interesse [possent] spiritibus quodammodo, tales spiritus delectati Aristotele, quia cogitavit juste, quare repraesentata erat ei quandoque talis faemina, quae ejus genas mulceret; faemina erat repraesentatio a spiritibus viris, qui circum eum, et habuerunt subjectum, sic ut faemina non esset spiritus, sed esset repraesentatio faeminae, sicut mihi prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3952/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3856" target=_top>3856</a>]. </p>
