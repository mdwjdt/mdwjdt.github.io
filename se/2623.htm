<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2623</h4><p>2623. who in their bodily life had not yet acquired pleasure in such things from actual deeds, yet who had received it hereditarily, thus to those men and women who in their early youth when they are touched by that pleasure also find it enjoyable, some very enjoyable. For pleasures in the other life are communicated-there are so to speak exhalations of them. If, however, the human race had not become so infected by heredity, they would not only feel no pleasure therefrom, but would feel unpleasantness and nausea, all of which shows what the human race today is like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2623</h4><p>2623. who in the life of their body have not yet acquired by actuality [any] pleasantness from such things, but still have received it by inheritance. [It has also[ extended to those who [qui et quae] [are] in their first youth, and who when affected by that pleasantness also suppose it pleasant: certain [suppose it to be] most pleasant, for in the other life pleasantnesses are communicated. There are, as it were, exhalations of them, when yet if the human race had not been so infected from inheritance, not only would they not feel any pleasantness thence, but unpleasantness and disgust [nausea]; from which may be manifest of what quality is the human race at this day. </p>
