<p>278.这些居所的排列次序。我还得以思考内层天堂居所的排列次序或位置；我突然想到，这次序排列得恰到好处，好叫它们能构成一种形式；在这个形式中，一个关注并围住另一个，只是我不能明白这种形式。因为我从上面还听见我认为在低级灵人当中的灵人在说话。因此，它们的位置并非只取决于高度，还取决于一种不可察觉的排列次序。若探究它们的排列次序，大脑腺体的排列次序似乎能说明这个问题，或说在这些居所上投下某种光明；因为一个人里面就有诸如对应于宇宙万物，甚至对应于位置和排列次序的那类事物。（1747年11月29日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 278</h4><p>278. The arrangement of the habitations<p>It was also granted me to reflect on the arrangement or situation of the habitations of the inward heaven, <sup>1</sup>and it struck me that there was a precise order, so that they formed a figure by which the one habitation faced and enclosed the other, but which I was unable to understand. For from above, I also heard spirits speaking whom I thought to be among the lower ones. So their situation is not determined by height alone, but also by some incomprehensible arrangement.<p>The arrangement of the glands in the brain would seem to be able to cast some light on this matter, if investigated; for in the individual human being are such things as interrelate, both as to situation and as to arrangement, with those in the universal human being. 1747, the 29th day of November.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262, footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 278</h4><p>278. THE ORDER OF THE HABITATIONS <p>It was also granted me to think concerning the order or situation of the habitations of the interior heaven; and it occurred to me that the order was fittingly arranged, so that they might constitute a form in which the one would regard and include the other. I could not understand this, however, for I also heard those speaking from a higher place who, I supposed, were among the lower spirits, so that their situation is not according to height alone, but also according to a kind of imperceptible order. <sup>1</sup>The order of the glands of the brain seems able to afford some light on these habitations, if their order were explored; for in an individual man there are such things as correspond to those which are in the universe, even as to situation and order. 1747, Nov. 29. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The MS. has orbem (globe, circuit), but this seems to be a slip for ordinem (order). </p>

Ordo mansionum<p>Cogitare etiam mihi concedebatur de ordine seu situ mansionum interioris coeli, et obveniebat, quod concinnus ordo esset, ita ut formarent formam, qua una spectaret, concluderetque alteram, sed quam intelligere non potui, nam e superiori etiam audiebam loquentes, quos <sup>1</sup></p><p>arbitrarer esse inter inferiores, ita ut situs eorum, non sit secundum altitudinem solam, sed etiam secundum orbem <sup>2</sup></p><p>quendam non perceptibilem; glandularum cerebri ordo videtur aliqualem lucem in his praebere posse, si ordo earum exploratus foret, nam in homine singulo sunt talia, etiam quoad situs et ordinem, quae correspondent iis in universo. 1747, die 29 Nov.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
