<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3113</h4><p>3113. About a certain proud one, inflated to the top<p>There was a certain one who, although not among the prouder sort, was still among those who had blown themselves up with arrogance in the days of their life. There was a discussion and mental image of those who despise others in comparison with themselves, and think that it is they alone who are living, and like qualities that could fit him - for there are many kinds and species of pride, as many as the fantasies from love of oneself and from despisal of others in comparison with oneself, for which reason he was allowed to be blown up by the fantasy in him at the time. He was being inflated even so as to fill up the universe to the point where there was no more room. So he was searching around himself at all sides, where to go, but as there was no longer anywhere, he could not move, saying he could not exist unless he were restored to his original size. Those who were blowing him up were at the back side of my head, and a little higher than the head.<p>The reason he was thus blown up is that he had an idea of angels as being wretched, and thus worms, creeping, which he also showed by a mental image, because those who think they live from themselves imagine all angels to be like that, thus that they alone are living. So this was his punishment. 1748, 10 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3113</h4><p>3113. CONCERNING A CERTAIN PROUD SPIRIT WHO WAS INFLATED TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. <p>There was a certain [spirit], although not amongst those of the prouder sort, [fastuosiores] but yet amongst those who have also puffed themselves [inflaverat, I think] up with pride, in the days of their life. When the discourse and idea were touching those who despise others in comparison with themselves, and [suppose] it is they alone who live, and similar [traits], which could agree with his disposition [ei]: for there are many genera and species of pride, according to phantasies [springing] from self-love and contempt of others, in comparison with self: on which account he was permitted to be inflated according to the phantasy, then belonging [penes] to him. He was [then] so inflated as to fill the universe, so that there was no more any space so that he looked around on every side, where to go: but [there being] no longer [any space] anywhere [remains] therefore immovable: and so said that he could not exist [esse], unless restored to his original magnitude. Those who blew him up [out] [insuffabant], were at the hinder part of my head: thus a little above the head. The reason why he was so blown up [out] [insuffatus], was because [his] idea concerning the angels was, that they [are] wretched [miseri] [beings], and thus [are like] crawling worms. This idea also continued, inasmuch as such [spirits] as think they live from themselves, thus that they alone live, regard all angels as such. Wherefore, this was his punishment. - 1748, September 10. </p>

De quodam fastuoso ad summum inflato<p>Erat quidam, quamvis non inter fastuosiores sed usque inter eos qui fastu quoque se inflaverant <sup>1</sup></p><p>diebus vitae suae, is cum sermo esset et idea, de iis qui alios prae se contemnunt, et se esse [putant] solos qui vivunt, et similibus <sup>2</sup></p><p>quae ei potuerunt convenire--nam <sup>3</sup></p><p>fastus plura genera et species sunt, secundum phantasias ex amore sui, et contemptu aliorum prae se, quare remissum ei ut inflaretur secundum phantasiam tunc penes eum--inflabatur <sup>4</sup></p><p>usque ut adimpleret universum, sic ut amplius non esset spatium, ut circumspiceret se undique, quo iret, sed nullibi amplius sic immotus, sic dicens quod non posset esse, nisi restitueretur ad pristinam sui magnitudinem; qui insufflabant eum, erant a parte capitis mei posteriore, sic paulum a capite superius: quod insufflatus ita causa erat, quia idea {a} erat de angelis, quod miseri et sic vermes, repentes, quod etiam idea {a} sistebat, quia omnes angelos putant tales, [ii] qui ex semet vivere putant, sic se solum vivere, quare hoc erat ejus poena. 1748, 10 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
