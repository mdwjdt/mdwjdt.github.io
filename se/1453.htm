<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1453</h4><p>1453. Those who appear on the other side of the Planet Venus are worshippers of the Lord. Some from there came here, overhead, and said that they acknowledge, and had acknowledged, only our Lord, and that He had appeared to them, and that they believe He is present with them, and more than that, that He walks among them, which they portrayed to me. They said that they see Him as if walking among them, so they pictured Him as if He were actually walking with them. They also declared that they were only cattle herders. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1453</h4><p>1453. Those who appear on the other side of the planet Venus are worshippers of the Lord. Some of them from there came hither; they were above the head. They said that they acknowledge and had acknowledged our Lord alone, and that He had appeared to them, and that they believe that He is with them, and even more that He walks among them, which they represented to me. Further, that they see Him as if He were walking among them, wherefore they thus represented Him as if to the life walking with them. They also said that they were only keepers of cattle. </p>
