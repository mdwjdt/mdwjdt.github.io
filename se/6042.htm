<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6042</h4><p>6042. About Melancthon and Luther<p>It was added that in his [Luther's] vaulted room there are many things that are shabby and depressing, and when he sees that the decor is more pleasing where others are who write, he asks why, and it is said because they think also about good works. And when he hears this, he wants to think about them too. But because he cannot, he prays to God to be able, and then something flows in from heaven, as if dictated, which he writes down. But in spite of this, when he reads it afterwards, he does not understand; and in spite of this his room then appears ornamented with various things, but they soon vanish. Many come to him from the earth, chiefly Englishmen, but he does not let them in because of the shabbiness of his room. But he has found out how to make what look like decorations by using the power of imagination. However, while he is speaking these things vanish, and things look as they usually do. So they go away and do not return.</p><p>[2] Luther later acquired a vaulted room in the vicinity of Melancthon, but it was more ornate than Melanchthon's Room because he still had spoken about good works a person should do out of obedience, although he did not place salvation in them. I heard about him several times: that he wanted to reject his principles about the separation [of faith and charity], and that he had tried, but in vain, because before this [can happen] the dense cloud that appears in his mind must be dispelled. Before this, truth, or light from heaven, cannot enter. נThe same was said to the Zinzendorfians, certain of whom had wanted to dispel their separation [of faith and good works], and had tried to accept their conjunction, but it was said to them that they could not do this because false beliefs stood in the way. These must first be dispelled, and that they are like the five virgins who had no oil in the lamps, who afterwards bought oil [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matt. 25:1</a>ֱ3].<p>Luther related that he was told by an Angel from the Lord to guard against faith, because there is nothing in it, on which account he had guarded against it for a time and recommended works, but yet he had continued to separate works from faith, and consequently abhorred the Epistle of James and rejected Revelation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6042</h4><p>6042. MELANCTHON AND LUTHER. <p>It was further said, that there are many articles in his [i.e. Melancthon's] vaulted chamber, <sup>1</sup>which are uncouth and repulsive and, when he sees, that, with others who write, there are more elegant things around them, he asks the reason; and it is stated that it is because they think of good works as well [as of faith]. When he hears this, he also wishes to think of them; but, as he cannot, he prays God that he may be able; and then something inflows from heaven, as if dictated, which he writes; but, still, when he reads it afterwards he does not understand it; and, yet, his chamber then appears adorned with various things, but they are soon removed. Many come to him from other countries, especially the English; but he does not admit them, on account of the unsightly things in his chamber. He has, however, discovered how to produce appearances of decorations by phantastic art; but these are removed while he is speaking, and things appear as usual: wherefore the visitors go away and do not come back. <p>Afterwards, Luther obtained a vaulted chamber in the neighborhood of Melancthon; but it was more elegant than Melancthon's chamber, because he constantly spoke of works which man should do from obedience, although he did not place any saving efficacy in them. I heard, several times, concerning him, that he wished to reject his principles in the separation [of faith and works], and that he has tried to, but to no purpose, because the dense cloud which appears in his mind must first be dispersed, before truth, or light, from heaven, can enter. The like was said to the Zinzendorfians, some of whom wished to discard their own separation [of faith and works], and endeavored to adopt their conjunction, but they were told that they could not, because falsities, which must first be scattered, block the way; and, also, that they are like the five virgins who had not oil in their lamps, who afterwards purchased oil. <p>Luther related that he was told by an angel, from the Lord, to beware of faith [alone], because there is nothing in that; and therefore he avoided it for some time, and recommended works; but, yet, he went on to separate the works from faith, and therefore execrated the Epistle of James, and rejected the Apocalypse. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See n, <a href="../se/6040.htm">6040</a>, above. -TR. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6042 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6042. De Melanchthone et Luthero<p>Porro dictum quod in camera ejus lacunata sint plura quae rudia et tristia, et cum videt apud alios qui scribunt, quod ibi decoratiora sint, quaerit causam, et dicitur quia cogitant etiam de bonis operibus; et cum id audit, etiam vult de illis cogitare, sed quia non potest, orat Deum ut possit, et tunc influit aliquid e coelo sicut dictatum, quod scribit, sed usque postea cum legit non intelligit, et tunc usque apparet camera ejus variis ornata, sed mox disparantur: plures ad eum ex terris veniunt praecipue Angli, sed non admittit illos propter indecora quae in ejus camera, sed invenit per artem phantasticam facere apparentias decoramentorum, verum illa inter loquendum disparantur; et apparent sicut solet, quare abeunt et non redeunt.<p>[2] Lutherus dein cameram lacunatam nactus in confinio Melanchthonis, sed illa erat ornatior Camera Melanchthonis, quia usque loquutus de operibus, quae homo facturus ex obedientia, tametsi non salvificum in illis posuerit. Audivi de illo aliquoties, quod vellet rejicere sua principia de separatione, et quod tentaverit, sed incassum, quia densum nubis, quod in ejus mente apparet, prius discutiendum est, prius non potest verum seu lux e coelo intrare. - Simile dictum est Zinzendorfianis, quorum quidam etiam voluerunt discutere suam separationem, et tentaverunt recipere conjunctionem, sed dictum eis quod non possent, quia falsa obstant, quae prius discutienda; et quod sint similes 5 virginibus, quae non oleum habebant in lampadibus, quae postea oleum emebant [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_6042/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_1-13" target=_top>Matth. XXV: 1-13</a>]. Narravit Lutherus, quod dictum sit ei per Angelum a Domino, ut caveat a fide, quia non est aliquid in ea, quare aliquo tempore cavit, et opera recommendavit, sed usque continuavit separare opera a fide, et sic Epistolam Jacobi devovit, et Apocalypsin rejecit. </p>
