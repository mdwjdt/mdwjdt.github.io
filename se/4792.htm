<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4792</h4><p>4792. But they were told that they are mistaken in believing that the Lord is a mere person when actually He is God; that loving the Lord when one doesn't have the goodness of a life based on the precepts of faith is extremely dangerous because the Lord is Holiness itself, and they, from their way of life, are filthy and profane, which cannot receive holiness. For what receives the Lord is the Divine itself, or the holiness of the Lord, that is with a person, thus the goodness that is from the Lord; and that the Lord cannot be joined to a person and cannot be received by a person other than in what is His own that the person has received. But they have absolutely no desire to do this, saying that all the things about them come from the Lord and are holy, including evils of life, by virtue of the fact that these are not noticed [by God].</p><p>[2] And they were also told that the Lord does not flow into faith's truths except through goodness, thus not into the intellect except through the will. As regards their saying that they have a feeling, they were told that this feeling is not a perception of truth but a feeling of the confirmation of their doctrine, and that this comes from an inflow of those people who had held this doctrine in the world. For such people have a greater desire than others to make proselytes because they believe that they themselves are the only ones who are happy. This is why those spirits have such a desire, and there is an inflow from which comes the feeling, as for example, with Quakers there are Quaker spirits, and with Enthusiasts there are Enthusiastic spirits, likes are attached to likes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4792</h4><p>4792. But they were told that they are in the falsity that the Lord is a mere man, when yet He is God; and that to love the Lord, if they are not in the good of life according to the precept of faith, is most perilous, because the Lord is the Holy Itself; and that it is not possible for those who are of filthy and profane life, to receive the holy; for that which receives the Lord, is the Divine Itself, or the holy of the Lord in man, thus good from the Lord; and that the Lord cannot be conjoined with man, nor be received by man, otherwise, than in that of His own, which is received by the man. But they were not at all of this opinion, saying that all things in them are holy from the Lord, even evils of life; consequently, that these are not heeded. And they were also told that the Lord does not inflow into the truths of faith, except by means of good, thus, not into the intellectual faculty, except through the will. Inasmuch as they assert themselves to have the sensation [of the Lord's influx], they were told that that sensation is not the perception of truth, but the sensation of the confirmation of their doctrine, and that it comes from the influx of those who have been in that doctrine in the world. For they possess, above others, the characteristic that they wish to make proselytes, for the reason that they believe themselves alone to be happy; hence those spirits have such a desire and influx - whence is the sensation. As, also, with Quakers are Quaker spirits, and with enthusiasts, enthusiastic spirits. Like are adjoined to like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4792 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4792. Sed illis dictum quod in falso sint quod Dominus sit purus homo, cum tamen est Deus; et quod Dominum amare, si non in bono vitae sunt secundum praecepta fidei, sit periculosissimum, quia Dominus est ipsum sanctum, et illi ex vita spurci, et prophani, quod recipere sanctum non potest, nam quod recipit Dominum est ipsum Divinum aut sanctum Domini apud hominem, ita bonum a Domino, et quod Dominus aliter non possit conjungi homini, nec recipi ab homine quam in Suo, quod ab homine recipitur. Sed hoc prorsus non volebant, dicentes quod omnia apud illos sancta sint a Domino, et quoque mala vitae, per id quod non attendantur. Et quoque illis dictum est, quod Dominus non influat in vera fidei nisi per bonum, ita non in intellectuale nisi per voluntatem. Quod dicant se sensationem habere, dictum est illis, quod sensatio illa non sit perceptio veri, sed sensatio confirmationis doctrinae illorum, et quod illa veniat ab influxu illorum qui in illa doctrina fuerunt in mundo: nam hoc prae aliis habent, quod velint proselytas facere, ex causa quia credunt se solum felices esse, inde spiritibus illis talis cupido, et influxus, unde sensatio; sicut etiam apud quakeros sunt spiritus quakeriani, et apud enthusiastas spiritus enthusiastici, similes similibus adjunguntur. </p>
