<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3876</h4><p>3876. In a silent speech I spoke with them, saying that into a higher knowledge of true faith feelings can be poured in their likeness; that thought arouses feelings; but the fact is, that when there are passions, then thoughts arouse them, but when there are feelings of true faith, then they are poured into the higher knowledge of true faith by the Lord, and are vivified. But then they become like another bird, which is a good one, but of a darker color. This showed that it symbolized the inhabitants of Mars, namely, those who are now little by little beginning to decline from a state of integrity, as they call it, and yet still imagine it to be the Lord; with whom inner sight no longer exists. 1748, 6 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3876</h4><p>3876. By a tacit speech I spoke with them, [saying], that affections of corresponding character could be infused into the knowledges of true faith; that thought might excite affections; but this holds especially in regard to cupidities which are excited by thought. But when there are affections of true faith, then they are infused by the Lord into the knowledges of true faith and vivified; but they then become like another bird of good quality, but of a darker color. It thence appeared that it signified the inhabitants of Mars, those, namely, who now begin by degree to decline from a state of integrity, as they call it, and yet think themselves to be the Lord; with whom perception no longer remains. - 1748, November 6. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3876 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3876. Tacita loquela loquutus cum iis, quod in cognitiones verae fidei infundi possint affectiones ad similitudinem earum, quod cogitatio excitet affectiones, sed hoc se habet, dum cupiditates, quod tunc cogitationes excitent eas; at cum affectiones verae fidei, tunc a Domino cognitionibus verae fidei infunduntur et vivificantur; sed tunc fiunt sicut avis altera, quae bona, sed coloris obscurioris. Inde constabat, quod significaret Martis incolas, eos nempe, qui paullatim nunc incipiunt a statu integritatis, ut illum vocant, declinare, et usque adhuc putant esse Dominum; apud quos perceptio non amplius. 1748, 6 Nov. </p>
