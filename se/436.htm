<p>436.一种四处奔跑的惩罚。有些人以这种方式被自己的幻觉惩罚，即：他们觉得自己似乎在绕着一个环行路线向后跑，或从右向左跑，或照着他们的幻觉以其它方式跑。就这样，每当他们以很短的回旋往返时，就把某种压弯他们的东西带给自己。这种惩罚会临到那些让自己被欲望引导，即便看见并承认真理，仍旧回到自己的幻觉，被自己的贪欲牵引之人。因此，他们进入了理解力的领域，承认自己所看到的真理，却被自己的欲望牵引，回过头来反对它。这一点尤其适用于女人，在女人身上，欲望通常占主导地位，她们像男人一样扰乱那些涉及信之教义的事物。（1747年12月31日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 436</h4><p>436. A kind of punishment consisting in running around<p>There are some whom fantasies punish in this way, namely by their seeming to themselves to be running around and around in a circle backwards, either from right to left, or the reverse, depending on to the fantasies. In this way, in quite short gyres, they time and again come back and go out again, carrying something with them that is weighing them down.<p>This kind of punishment comes to those who let themselves be led along by their desires, and even though they see and acknowledge truths, nevertheless go back on them, drawn by their yearnings. Thus they go forth into the field of understanding and recognize [truth], but being drawn by their desire, fall back into opposing it.<p>This is especially applicable to women, in whom desires normally take precedence, when they join in like men in matters regarding the doctrines of faith. 1747, the 31st day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 436</h4><p>436. A SPECIES OF PUNISHMENT BY RUNNING AROUND <p>There are those whom their phantasies punish in this way: namely, they seem to themselves to be running around a circuit backward, or from right to left, or by their phantasies in some other way; and thus as often as they go and return by short enough gyres, they draw something with them which aggravates them. This kind of punishment is for those who suffer themselves to be led by their cupidities, and although they see and acknowledge truths, they nevertheless still return [to their phantasies], being drawn away by their cupidities. Thus they make excursions into the intellectual field, and acknowledge [what they see], but being drawn by their cupidity they return to their repugnances. This is more applicable to women, in whom cupidities usually have predominance, who meddle with those things which concern the doctrines of faith, like men. 1747, Dec. 31. </p>
