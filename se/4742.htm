<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4742</h4><p>4742. What spirits he had communication with was shown, namely that it was with those from among two societies. [Some were] from among one [of the societies] that are azure blue [sic] from the planet Jupiter. They are good; they have as their goal always becoming more perfect. These spirits are good. Charles XII was of this nature too when in a good state; he then wanted absolutely nothing else than what is true. The other society was not far in the universe from these azure blue ones, on the right at a distance to be exact. These are of such a nature that they are the most stubborn of all and never desist from what has been proposed once they have taken it up, whether it is good or whether it is evil. And they nevertheless think it is true. These were those with whom he communicated, for such stubbornness is not found to the ends of the earth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4742</h4><p>4742. It was shown with which spirits he communicated, namely, [with spirits] from two societies; from one of which are Cerulean spirits who are from the planet Jupiter, and are good. They have for an end, that they may be continually perfected. These spirits are good, of such a quality also as Charles XII himself when in a good state; then, he altogether wished nothing else but truth. The other society was in the universe, not far from those Ceruleans, namely, on the right side, at a distance. They are such as are, of all, the most obstinate, so that they never desist from a resolution once taken, whether it is good, or bad, and yet they think according to the truth. These were those with whom he communicated for such obstinacy does not exist within the limits of this planet. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4742 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4742. Ostensum cum quibus spiritibus communicabat, nempe a binis societatibus, ab una quae coeruleae sunt, et ex Jovis tellure, qui boni, qui pro fine habent ut semper perficiantur, illi spiritus sunt boni, qualis etiam ille C: XII cum in statu bono, tunc prorsus non aliud voluit quam verum: altera societas erat, in universo non procul a coeruleis illis, nempe ad dextrum latus ad distantiam, illi tales sunt ut sint omnium obstinantissimi, et quod nusquam desistant a proposito semel capto, sive bonum sit sive malum, et tamen etiam pro vero cogitant, hi fuerunt cum quibus communicavit, nam talis obstinatio non dabatur intra hujus telluris limites. </p>
