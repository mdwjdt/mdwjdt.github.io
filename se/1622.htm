<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1622</h4><p>1622. Spirits tell very tall tales, and they lie<p>When spirits begin to speak with a person, one must take care not to believe them at all, for almost everything they say, they have made up, and they are lying. If for example they are allowed to tell what heaven is like, and how matters stand in the heavens, they would tell so many lies, with great assurance, that the person would be astounded. Therefore, I was not allowed to give credence to the spirits who were speaking in regard to anything they told. 1748, 20 March.<p>For they are very fond of fabricating, and whenever any topic of conversation is raised, they think they know all about it, and express their opinions about it one after the other, as if they knew exactly; and if anyone then listens to them and believes them, then they press on, and in various ways trick and mislead the person.<p>Or if they are allowed to tell about things to come, about things unknown in the whole heaven, about anything whatever that a person hopes for, then everything, as it is from themselves, they would say untruthfully. So such persons must take care not to believe them, this being the reason why the condition of speaking with spirits on this planet is most dangerous, unless one has true belief. They bring on such a strong persuasion that it is the Lord Himself speaking and commanding, that the person cannot help but believe, and obey. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1622</h4><p>1622. THAT SPIRITS RELATE THINGS EXCEEDINGLY FICTITIOUS, AND LIE. <p>When spirits begin to speak with man, he must beware lest he believe them in anything; for they say almost anything; things are fabricated by them, and they lie; for if they were permitted to relate what heaven is, and how things are in the heavens, they would tell so many lies, and indeed with solemn affirmation, that man would be astonished; wherefore, when spirits were speaking, I was not permitted to have faith in the things which they related. - 1748, March 20. For they are extremely fond of fabricating: and whenever any subject of discourse is proposed, they think that they know it, and give their opinions one after another, one in one way, and another in another, altogether as if they knew; and if man then listens and believes, they press on, and deceive, and seduce in divers ways: for example, if they were permitted to tell about things to come, about things unknown in the universal heaven, about all things whatsoever that man desires, yet [they would tell] all the things falsely from themselves; wherefore let men beware lest they believe them. On this account the state of speaking with spirits on this earth is most perilous, unless one is in true faith. They induce so strong a persuasion that it is the Lord Himself who speaks and who commands, that man cannot but believe and obey. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1622 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1622. Quod spiritus, valde ficta narrent et mentiantur<p>Dum spiritus incipiunt cum homine loqui, cavendum est, ne quicquam iis credant, nam quicquid dicant fere, ficta ab iis sunt, et mentiuntur, si enim iis liceret narrare <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quale sit coelum, et quomodo se habeant res <sup>1</sup></p><p>in coelis, tam multa mendacia narrarent, ut homo obstupesceret, et quidem cum asseveratione, quare spiritibus loquentibus non licuit mihi fidem habere, in iis quae narrabant. 1748, 20 Martius. Fingendi enim cupidi sunt, et quandocunque aliquid objectum est loquendi, putant id scire, et de eo opinantur <sup>1</sup></p><p>unus <sup>1</sup></p><p>post alium aliter, prorsus tanquam <sup>1</sup></p><p>scirent, et si homo tunc auscultat <sup>1</sup></p><p>et credit, tunc instant, et diversimode <sup>1</sup></p><p>decipiunt et seducunt; ut si liceret iis dicere de venturis <sup>1</sup></p><p>, de incognitis <sup>1</sup></p><p>in universo coelo, de omnibus, quaecunque homo cupit, omnia, dum <sup>1</sup></p><p>ex <sup>1</sup></p><p>se, [dicerent] mendaciter, quare sibi caveant, ut iis <sup>1</sup></p><p>credant, ideo status loquendi cum spiritibus in hac tellure, est periculosissimus, nisi in fide vera sit. Inducunt tam fortem persuasionem, quod Dominus Ipse sit, qui loquitur, et qui imperat, ut non possit homo, quin credat, et obediat <sup>1</sup></p><p>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;hoc verbum in the Manuscript manu B.
