<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4890</h4><p>4890. After this spiders were also seen dropping from the middle heaven. They were larger and had an uglier shape, and there were very many of them. However, they were not as diabolical as that first one because the wickedest ones make themselves out to be angels of light more than others do, thus to be more beautiful than the rest. They know how to hide the poison they have in themselves by using an outward breathing, restraining their inward breathing for fear it may be noticed, for as soon as their inward breathing is perceived, they are discovered, since the breathing of all in one society is alike. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4890</h4><p>4890. After this were also seen spiders of a larger and uglier form, which had come down out of the middle heaven; and there were very many of them. These, at that time, were not so diabolical as that first one; for the most wicked make themselves out angels of light beyond others, thus more beautiful than the rest. The venom which they have in themselves, they know how to conceal by means of the external respiration, holding back the internal lest it should be perceived; for as soon as that interior [respiration] is perceived they are detected, inasmuch as the respiration of all in one society is similar. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4890 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4890. Postea araneae etiam visae delapsae e coelo medio, majori et turpiori forma, et perplures eorum, qui tamen non fuerunt tam diabolici ac prior ille, nam pessimi se prae aliis faciunt lucis angelos, ita pulchriores reliquis. Venena quae in se habent sciunt recondere per respirationem externam, interna retenta ne percipiatur, nam statim ut interna percipitur, detecti sunt, quoniam respiratio omnium in una societate est similis. </p>
