<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>297.那些被弥赛亚神从低地或坑里提升至内层天堂，以及更内层天堂的人，其地方和居所以最精准的方式被分配给他们。我想知道，数千，甚至上万的人如何被弥赛亚神从坑里或低地提上来；尤其是，他们如何都能在天堂被分配自己的地方。最终，我今天获知，他们当中绝大部分觉得自己似乎被运送到马车或车辆上，去往各个地方，然后尝试这个或那个地方是否合适；也就是说，这个人与那里的灵魂是否和谐一致。如果不合适（大多数是这种情况），他们就继续，直到找到一致的，从而安歇下来；也就是说，直到他们来到与其本性和谐一致的灵魂当中。凡被弥赛亚神提上来的灵魂，没有找不到安歇之处，从而与同他们自己的本性一致的其他人相伴的。对有些人来说，这种转移会持续很长一段时间，但没有焦虑。在此期间，他们也会变得更适应和完善，以至于能住在一个天堂社群。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 297</h4><p>297. Those who are raised up from the lower part of the earth, or pit, by God the Messiah, into the inward heaven, <sup>1</sup>also into the very inward one, are allotted their own places and habitations in a most precise manner .<p>I was amazed how thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, were raised up by God the Messiah out of the pit, or lower parts of the earth, and especially how all of them were able to be allotted their own places in the heavens. Finally today, I learned that the greatest part of them seem to themselves to be transported in carriages or coaches, and to be driven around to various places, to test whether this or that place is suitable, that is, whether the person is in harmony with the souls who are there. If not, as happens in most cases, they are carried about until they find agreement, and thus rest, namely among souls who harmonize with their own character. Nor is there ever any soul raised up by God the Messiah who does not find his or her own rest, and thus a companionship with others harmonious with his or her own character.<p>This travelling from place to place can take a rather long time for some, but there is no anxiety; for in the meantime they are also being adapted, and perfected, so as to be able to live within a heavenly society.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262, footnote 3. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 297</h4><p>297. THAT THOSE WHO ARE RAISED BY GOD MESSIAH FROM THE LOWER EARTH, OR THE PIT, INTO THE INTERIOR, THEN INTO THE MORE INTERIOR HEAVEN, HAVE THEIR PLACES AND HABITATIONS ALLOTTED MOST EXACTLY <p>I have wondered how the thousands, and perhaps myriads, who were raised by God Messiah from the pit, or the lower parts of the earth, could all be allotted their own places in the heavens. At length I learnt today that the greater part of them seem to themselves as though they are conveyed in chariots or carriages and carried around to various places, to try whether this or that place is suitable, that is, whether there is agreement with the souls who are there. If there is not, as for the most part is the case, they are carried on until at length they find agreement and thus quiet, that is to say, until they are with souls who are in agreement with their nature. Nor is any soul ever raised up by God Messiah who does not find his own quiet, and thus companionship with others in conformity with his own nature. This transference may continue for a long time with some, but there is no anxiety. In the meanwhile they are also being rendered more adaptable and perfect, so that they may be able to be within a heavenly society. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 297 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>297. Quod illi, qui ab inferiori terrae seu fovea a Deo Messia,in interius coelum, tum in intimius [elevantur, ii] <sup>1</sup></p><p>sua loca, et mansiones exactissime sortiantur<p>Miratus sum, quod a Deo Messia elevati sint milleni et forte myriades ex fovea, seu inferioribus terrae, et quidem quomodo omnes eorum sua loca in coelis sortiri possint:tandem hodie edoctus, quod plurima eorum pars videantur sibi, tanquam curribus aut rhedis vehi, et ad varia loca circumferri, et tentare an hic aut ibi conveniat, hoc est, num consensus sit ejus cum animabus, quae ibi sunt, si non, [ut]ut plurimum fit, feruntur tamdiu usque dum inveniunt consensum, et sic quietem, nempe cum animabus, quae suae indoli conveniunt, nec usquam datur ulla anima a Deo Messia elevata, quae non suam quietem et sic consortium suae indoli conforme cum aliis inveniat. Translatio haec aliquibus diutius perstare potest, verum non cum anxietate,interea etiam accommodantur magis, et perficiuntur, ut interesse societati coelesti queant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition [elevantur, ibi] </p>
