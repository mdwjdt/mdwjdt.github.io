<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2352</h4><p>2352. From the mental imagery of someone on earth the angels know down to the least details what kind of spirits are in the vicinity<p>The mental images of someone on earth, as said before [<a href="2062.htm">2062</a>, <a href="2297.htm">2297</a>], contain, or have within them, near them, and farther from them, countless elements that are usually raised up. This is a fact familiar to everyone. When I have been thinking or had a mental image of one thing, the elements in it and joined to it were aroused by spirits, and, of course, a variety of elements which agreed with themselves and their own nature. Evil spirits aroused evils that matched their character, good spirits good things, and from this the angels were able to recognize immediately, the Lord granting and causing it, the kinds and species of spirits that were present, as well as where they were, at what quarter, besides other things beyond my knowledge. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2352</h4><p>2352. (THAT ANGELS KNOW FROM AN IDEA OF MAN, EVEN HIS LEAST, WHAT SORT OF SPIRITS ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.) <p>Man's ideas, as already said, contain in themselves, have in themselves, near and remote from themselves, indefinite things all of which are wont to be excited, as may be known to anyone. When I exercised thought, or had an idea of a single thing, then those things which were in or near the idea were excited by spirits and indeed variously. They excited whatever accorded with themselves and their nature; the evil, evils according to their disposition; the good, goods. Hence the angels could immediately recognize the Lord granting and doing it, of what sort of genus and species were the spirits present, also where they were, and from what region, besides other things which I do not know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2352 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2352. Quod angeli ex idea hominis, etiam minima sciant, quales sunt spiritus in vicinia<p>Ideae hominis, ut dictum prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2352/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2062" target=_top>2062</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2352/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2297" target=_top>2297</a>], indefinita in se continent, habent in se, juxta se, et remotius a se, quae omnia solent excitari, sicut cuivis notum esse potest; cum cogitavi seu unius rei ideam habui, tunc quae in idea, et juxta ideam, excitabantur a spiritibus, et quidem varie, ii [excitabant] <sup>1</sup></p><p>quae sibi suaeque naturae congruebant, mali mala secundum indolem, boni bona, inde statim cognoscere potuerunt angeli Domino id dante et agente, qualis generis et speciei [erant] spiritus [qui] adessent, tum ubi, et quanam plaga, praeter alia quae non novi.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
