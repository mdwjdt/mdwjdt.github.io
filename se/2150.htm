<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2150</h4><p>2150. Man and spirit cannot do the least thing by themselves, even if they seem to themselves able to do everything on their own power.<p>Today further experience made me realize that a spirit can do not the least thing on his own, even if he seems to himself able to think, speak, and do everything. The experience is so abundant that if all the rest should be brought forward, it would fill every page.<p>Here I can say only this, that today spirits were told that they are powerless of themselves, at which they were indignant and said that they were able to act of themselves. So they were shown that they could do nothing, although being permitted to speak.<p>I saw in a spiritual mental image that there was a kind of limited field, the boundaries of which they could not possibly overstep. So these fields were shown them, and when the spirits tried to go beyond them, or speak beyond them, they were powerless to do so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2150</h4><p>2150. THAT MEN AND SPIRITS CANNOT DO THE LEAST THING FROM SELF, THOUGH TO THEMSELVES EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FROM THEM. <p>(It was granted me today to know by much experience that spirits cannot effect the least, although it seems to them that they can think, speak, and do everything from themselves. My experience [on this head] is so copious, that if all the rest should be displayed, it would fill every page. I will only relate that it was today told the spirits that they could effect nothing from themselves, whereat being indignant, they said they were able of themselves; wherefore it was shown them that they could effect nothing, that what they spoke was permitted them. I perceived in spiritual idea that there was, as it were, a sphere having limits, beyond which they could by no means pass. Wherefore such spheres were shown; and when spirits attempted to pass beyond, or speak, they could by no means do so. </p>
