<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2243</h4><p>2243. Afterwards I saw and heard that that shipmaster, who drove that ship with horses about at will into the deep, so as to submerge those inside, had been horribly tortured by many spirits, and all his bodily members so torn apart that hardly anything was left together. This really happened, and with intense pain, so that nothing was to be seen that was not all torn apart. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2243</h4><p>2243. Afterwards I perceived and heard that that shipmaster [nauclerus], who at pleasure [voluntario] steered about [circumducebat] the ship with horses, in the deep, in order to submerge [drown] those who were therein, was miserably distorted by many spirits, and so mangled, as to all bodily parts, that scarcely anything cohered, This was done to the reality [actualiter] to his great suffering [dolor], so that there appeared to be nothing that was not all mangled [laceratum]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2243 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2243. Postea percepi et audivi quod nauclerus iste, qui voluntario circumducebat navem cum equis in profundum, ut submergeret eos qui intus, quod misere erat a pluribus spiritibus distortus, et quoad omnia ejus corporea ita dilaniatus, ut vix quicquam cohaereret, hoc fiebat actualiter, cum ingenti dolorr ejus, sic ut nihil nisi laceratum omne videretur. </p>
