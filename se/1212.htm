<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1212</h4><p>1212. Those who obtain riches by cheatery never become wealthy,<p>but become poor<p>Even though it is put on record by many writers as an established truth, and is so familiar as to be common knowledge, that "ill-gotten gains do not come to the third heir," <sup>1</sup>nevertheless many do not care at all by what methods they acquire riches-so unbelieving and blind they are.<p>However, it was corroborated for me today also by angels that it is really so that riches fraudulently acquired flow away in ways that they themselves do not know, and then others grow rich. 1748, 7 March.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Spiritual Diary, Bush/Smithson 1883: "'Male parta ad tertium haeredem non veniant': the English proverbs corresponding to this are - 'Ill-gotten good seldom prosper,' or, 'Evil gotten-evil spent'; but the Scotch proverb immediately answers to the Latin: 'Ill-won gear winna enrich the third heir.'" </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1212</h4><p>1212. THAT THOSE WHO ACQUIRE RICHES BY DECEITFUL MEANS NEVER BECOME WEALTHY, BUT BECOME POOR <p>Although this is evident as a truth from the acts of very many, and is so familiar as to be known in the common saying that, "ill-gotten gains do not come to the third heir", still for all that, very many are so incredulous and blind that they do not care by what means they acquire wealth. Today, however, it was also confirmed to me by the angels that this is so, and that ill-gotten wealth so melts away that they themselves do not know how; but others indeed are enriched. 1748, Mar. 7. </p>
