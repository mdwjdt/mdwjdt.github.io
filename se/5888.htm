The latter, although he knew a person was a friend, still took it upon himself to harm him, and did this stubbornly, wanting to destroy him.

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5888</h4><p>5888. THE QUALITY OF THOSE WHO ARE LIKE CARL BROMAN. <p>One was exhibited who resembled Carl Broman; and, although he knew that a person was a friend, he yet set to work to bring evil upon him, and this stubbornly, wishing to destroy him. He did this solely for the reason that he hoped for profit; or else he favored him by whom he thought to obtain the reputation of wealth. </p>

Quales qui similes Carl Broman<p>Ostensus qui similis Carl Broman, et is tametsi sciebat amicum esse, usque ille suscepit in se malum ei inferre, et hoc contumaciter, volendo perdere illum, faciebat hoc solum ex eo quod speraret lucrum, aut faveret ei a quo credebat lucri famam acceptare. </p>
