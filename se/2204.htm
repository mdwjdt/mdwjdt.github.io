<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2204</h4><p>2204. It had previously been unknown to me what caused this to occur so neatly and in that sequence one after another. But later it was made clear to me, also by experience, namely that there is a society like that, consisting of spirits or angels having the same kind of affection, in all its varieties. So it was the society thus showing itself, while yet there was only one who was like a center for the rest, to whom they were reflected one after the other, as they were arranged within the society. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2204</h4><p>2204. The cause was already known to me how this could exist so fitly [concinne], and in that order and series; but afterwards it was also manifested to me by experience, to wit, that the society was such a one as that therein were spirits or angels of a similar species of affection with its varieties; wherefore the society thus manifested itself when yet there was one who was, as it were, the center of the rest, to whom the rest were referred in the order in which they were in the society.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2204 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2204. Causa mihi prius ignota fuit, quomodo tam concinne, et eo ordine et serie id existeret, sed postea mihi per experientiam quoque manifestatum, quod nempe societas talis sit, in qua spiritus vel angeli similis speciei affectionis cum suis varietatibus, quare sic societas se manifestabat, cum tamen unus esset, qui erat quasi centrum reliquorum, ad quem referebantur reliqui in ordine, ut erant in societate. </p>
