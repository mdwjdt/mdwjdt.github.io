<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 793</h4><p>793. About one who is lukewarm<p>One of those who are devils, and who from hatred persecute truth and goodness the most, coming up to me, did not want to do anything [wrong] at all, behaving as though he had repented. Nor did I sense any deceit, even though I did think that he harbored deceits within, only awaiting the opportunity, but meanwhile putting himself forth as a good spirit, and converted.<p>Someone fleeing far away from him, told me that he could not bear his presence, because he smelled like vomit, which made him want to vomit. This was because he was like the one of whom it is said, that he must be spewed out [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_16.htm">Rev. 3:16</a>]. 1748, 15 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 793</h4><p>793. CONCERNING A CERTAIN LUKEWARM SPIRIT <p>One of those who are devils, and who especially from hatred persecute what is true and good, came flowing to me.

A certain spirit fleeing far away from him told me that he could not bear his presence, for he felt it like vomit, so that he wanted to vomit, because that spirit was like those of whom it is said that they were to be spewed out [Rev. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_16.htm">iii 16</a>. 1748, Feb. 15. </p>
