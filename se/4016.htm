<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4016</h4><p>4016. Concerning the omnipresence of the Lord<p>They who think in outermost and from outermost qualities are unable to grasp how the Lord can be omnipresent. But in order that this may be grasped to some extent, it must be known that in the other life there is neither space, nor time, so all are so present that they are right beside each other, even if they were in the last stretches of the universe. It is also somewhat evident from the fact that the human soul, which is man's innermost part, can be omnipresent, be everywhere, in its small body, and thus govern all the internal organs, and all the thoughts, and all things pertaining to the person, however diverse they may be, and by its omnipresence provide for all and the very least requirements, without which provision all things would fall apart in a moment. The soul acts from purpose, and because it is the innermost part of man, the Lord Alone provides through it. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4016</h4><p>4016. CONCERNING THE OMNIPRESENCE OF THE LORD.<p>Those who think in ultimates, and from ultimates, cannot comprehend how the Lord can be omnipresent. But in order to this being made in some degree intelligible, it is to be known that in the other life there is neither space nor time, thus all are as present to each other as if in the nearest proximity, even though they should really be in the extremity of the universe. It may also somewhat appear from this, that the soul of man, or his intimate [most interior] principle, may possess a kind of omnipresence by being everywhere throughout the contracted limits of his body: and so govern all the internal organs, and all the thoughts, and whatever belongs to the man, how manifold soever they may be, that everything shall fitly cohere, and also by its omnipresence provide for all and singular its parts, without which kind of providence the whole would be dissolved and dissipated in a moment. This principle [the soul] acts from an end, and because it is the intimate of man, the Lord alone provides by means of it. - 1748, November 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4016 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4016. De omnipraesentia Domini<p>Qui in ultimis et ex ultimis cogitant, non capere possunt, quomodo Dominus possit esse omnipraesens; sed hoc, ut aliquantum capiatur, sciendum, quod in altera vita, non sit spatium, nec tempus, ita omnes tam praesentes, ut juxta sint, si vel forent in ultimo universi: constare etiam potest aliquantum inde, quod anima hominis seu [id] quod ejus intimum est, possit omnipraesens esse ubivis in suo corpusculo, et omnia viscera, et omnia cogitata, et quicquid est hominis, quae tam diversissima sunt, ita regere, ut omnia cohaereant, et omnibus ac singulis omnipraesentia providere, cui si non talis providentia foret, dilaberentur omnia momento; ea ex fine agit, et quia est intimum hominis, Dominus Solus per eam providet. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
