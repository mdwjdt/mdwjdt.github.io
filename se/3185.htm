There are other spirits round about who also desire to attack them, but the good spirits do not fear them, and disperse everything belligerent just like that. So there are as it were battles and victories. All this also made it evident to me how evil spirits strive to attack a sleeping person, and how the Lord at every moment is protecting every human being. 1748, 17 Sept.<p>3185. 1/2. They said also that they could introduce sleep <sup>1</sup>whenever they wanted, which was shown by experience, but it was said, when it was allowed, thus [it was] not from them.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Somnum, "sleep," in the autograph, possibly for somnium, "a dream." </p>

There are other spirits around about, who also desire to infest them, but good spirits do not fear them, and so disperse such things as infest, so that there are, as it were, conflicts [pugnae] and victories.
