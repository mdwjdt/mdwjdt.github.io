<p>583.此外，他们当中的一些灵人与我同在，我向他们展示了地球上的居民，那时他们的脸在我看来都比平时小。这是因为他们看到我们地球人的脸比他们星球居民的脸小；他们说，这些脸不漂亮，既因为它们更小，还因为它们（由于天花、麻点而）有点变形，十分丑陋。他们补充说，在他们中间就没有发现这样的脸，也没有脸上因红粉刺之类的而带有疤痕的人，因为他们没有得病。有些脸是令人愉悦的，也就是嘴唇周围的区域有点突起的脸，还有那些一笑起来就舒展开的脸。他们不喜欢悲伤的脸，因为世俗的忧虑把这类表情印记在它们上面。因此，他们根据脸就能认出他们的品质。（1748年1月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 583</h4><p>583. Furthermore, some of their spirits were present with me, to whom I was showing the inhabitants of this planet, whose faces at the time all seemed to me smaller than usual. This happened because they were seeing the faces of the people of our earth as smaller than the faces of their earth's inhabitants, and they said that the faces were not beautiful, both because they were smaller, and because they were quite ugly on account of (koppor, kopparrig <sup>1</sup>). They said that among them such faces are not to be found, nor people who were blemished in the face by red pimples and the like, because they do not get sick. Some faces they smiled at, namely, those in which the region around the lips somewhat protruded, and those which widened so as to be laughing faces. Sad ones they did not enjoy, because worldly concerns imprint such expressions on them. Thus from the faces, they are able to recognize of what character people are. 1748, 26 January.<p>The annual movement of Jupiter is twelve years, and the diurnal movement six hours.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original, two Swedish words, "koppor, kopparrig," meaning "pustules, pock-marked," appear here in parentheses, and in the margin the Latin word "maculati," meaning "blemished." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 583</h4><p>583. Besides this, there were some of their spirits with me to whom I showed the inhabitants of this earth, and all their faces then appeared to me smaller than usual. This came about for the reason that they saw the faces of the men of our earth as smaller than the faces of the inhabitants of their earth; and they said that they were not beautiful, both because they were smaller, and because they were somewhat deformed from (small-pox, being pock-marked) <sup>1</sup>adding that such faces are not found amongst them, nor those whose faces were spotted with red pustules and the like, because they do not become sick. Certain faces were pleasing, namely, those in which the region about the lips was somewhat prominent, also those faces that were expanded as when they are laughing. Those that were sad did not please them, because worldly cares impress such things upon them. Thus from their faces they can recognize of what quality they are. 1748, Jan. 26. The annual motion of Jupiter is twelve [of our] years, and its diurnal motion six hours. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The words in brackets are written in Swedish: koppor, kopparrig. </p>

Praeterea <sup>1</sup></p><p>, fuerunt eorum spiritus apud me, quibus <sup>2</sup></p><p>ostendebam hujus telluris incolas, et omnes facies eorum tunc mihi videbantur minores solito, quod inde venit, quia ii videbant facies hominum nostrae telluris minores faciebus incolarum illorum telluris, et dicebant quod non pulchrae essent facies, tam quod minores essent, quam quod aliquantum deformes ex (koppor <sup>3</sup></p><p>, kopparrig 4), dicentes quod apud [eos] <sup>5</sup></p><p>tales non invenientur, nec qui maculati essent facie rubris pustulis, et similiter, quia non aegrotant: quaedam facies arridebant, quarum nempe regio circum labia paulum promineret, tum quae dilatarentur, nempe ut ridentes facies sint, tristes non delectabant, quia curae mundanae imprimunt talia; sic ex faciebus cognoscere possunt, quales sint. 1748, 26 Jan.<p>Motus annuus Jovis est 12 annorum, et motus diurnus est 6 horarum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
