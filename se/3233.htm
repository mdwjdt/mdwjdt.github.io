<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3233</h4><p>3233. On the spirits of Mercury<p>Again through intermediate spirits I have heard spirits of Mercury speaking voluminously, so fast that the spirit could hardly utter [their speech]. It was as if a volume of them were speaking together, but the speaking was not theirs, only the thought of the inward sense or memory, which, falling into the speech of the intermediate spirits, was so fast-likewise their grasp of my resulting thoughts. These they saw so promptly that they at once and momentaneously judged of their quality, saying this is so, that is not so, this is the quality of the deed. So their judgment was almost instantaneous. And in other ways, they were like they had been before [see <a href="1415.htm">1415-1435</a>, <a href="1441.htm">1441-1459</a>].<p>This is remarkable, that their thought was brought to me so voluminously that the spirits above me [came] rapidly in waves, as an atmosphere; also that their thought waves glided toward the left eye, even though they were toward the right at quite a distance. 1748, 21 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3233</h4><p>3233. CONCERNING THE SPIRITS OF MERCURY. <p>(I have again, by means of [through] intermediate spirits, heard the spirits of Mercury, who spoke in volume [voluminatim] so rapidly, that scarce could [an intermediate] spirit have uttered it. There was, as it were, a volume of them speaking together. But it was not their speech, [but] only the thought of the interior sense or memory that flowed into the speech of the intermediate spirit, [and was so rapid]. It was similar with the perception of those things, which were thought after that. So promptly did they perceive them, that at once, and in a moment, they judged [decided] as to the quality, saying, "This is so; this is not so; this is the quality." So that their decision [judicium] was almost instantaneous; and, moreover, they were similar to what they were before. This is remarkable, that their thought was brought to me in such volumes, that the spirits quickly undulated above me like an atmosphere; also that the cogitative undulation did not flow [labereter] towards the left eye, although they were some distance to the right. - 1748, September 21.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3233 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3233. De spiritibus Mercurii<p>Iterum per spiritus intermedios audivi spiritus Mercurii, qui volumatim loquentes [erant] ita cito, ut vix spiritus potuisset eloqui, erat quasi volumen eorum loquens simul, sed non loquela erat eorum, modo <sup>1</sup></p><p>cogitatio sensus seu memoriae interioris, quae in loquelam spiritus intermedii labens, tam cita erat, similiter perceptio eorum quae exhinc cogitata sunt, quae percipiebant tam prompte ut illico et momento judicarent quale esset, dicendo hoc ita, hoc non ita, actum quale, ita judicium eorum erat instantaneum fere; et praeterea similes sibi erant ut prius [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3233/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1415" target=_top>1415-1435</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3233/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1441" target=_top>1441-1459</a>]; hoc memorabile, quod cogitatio eorum ita volumatim ad me allata est, ut cito undularent spiritus supra me, sicut atmosphaera; tum quod undulatio cogitativa eorum laberetur versus sinistrum oculum, tametsi ii essent dextrorsum satis ad distantiam. 1748, 21 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has eorum modo </p>
