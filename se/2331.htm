<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2331</h4><p>2331. Then the conversation went on to the effect that now he has come into a kingdom that will last to eternity, and he should know what the laws of that kingdom are in order to be able to live happily to eternity. Without a deeper knowledge of the laws, no one can enter into this eternal Kingdom. Its laws are the laws of faith, consequently truths, for which people have no concern during life in the body, when yet they are laws that are eternal, and necessary to them in the Kingdom that will last to eternity. So a person should apply the mind to them, and not so much to things in the world except only to serve the needs of the body for the soul's sake, and the needs of society as a whole for the sake of their souls. This should be one's pursuit, for this is eternal, but not the physical and worldly things which when separated from things of the eternal kingdom, lead away from it and lead one to hell.<p>Such more or less was the conversation with spirits, and they are surprised that people have so little if any concern for matters that concern their souls, when yet it is on account of their souls, which live to eternity, that they are in the world. 1748, 16 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2331</h4><p>2331. Then my discourse was, that he has now come into a kingdom that should endure to eternity, and ought to know what are the laws of the kingdom, so as to be able to live happy to eternity. Without a knowledge of the laws no one can enter into this eternal kingdom; its laws are the laws of faith, consequently truths, for which they have no care during the life of the body, when yet these are the things which are eternal and necessary for him in a kingdom that was to endure to eternity, wherefore man should attend to these things, but not to such as are in the world save only to serve the body, for the sake of his soul, and [to serve] general society for the sake of their souls. This should be his aim, for this is [the] eternal; but not the corporeal and mundane, which are separate from those things that belong to the eternal kingdom. [These withdraw] and lead to hell. Such was nearly my discourse with spirits; and they wonder that they can have so little, if any, care for those things that belong to souls, when yet it is on their account that they are in the world, and these live to eternity. - 1748, June 16. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2331 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2331. Tum sermo fuit, quod nunc in regnum venit, quod duraturum in aeternum, et scire debeat, quae leges regni, ut possit felix vivere in aeternum, absque cognitione legum, nullus intrare potest in Regnum hoc aeternum, leges ejus sunt legis <sup>1</sup></p><p>fidei, proinde veritates, quarum nullam curam habent in vita corporis, cum tamen eae sunt quae aeternae, et ei necessariae in Regno in aeternum duraturo, quare iis intenderet homo, non ita iis quae in mundo, nisi modo ut inserviat corpori, animae suae causa <sup>2</sup></p><p>, et communi societati, eorum animarum causa; hoc studium esset, nam hoc aeternum, non autem corporeum et mundanum, quod separatum ab iis quae sunt regni aeterni, abducit, et inducit <sup>3</sup></p><p>in infernum; talis sermo fere erat cum spiritibus; et mirantur quod tam parvam si ullam curam habeant eorum quae sunt animarum, cum tamen eae sunt propter quas in mundo sunt, et quae in aeternum vivunt. 1748, 16 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
