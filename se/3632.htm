<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3632</h4><p>3632. Mediums are such that when many are about to speak through one, that one straightway becomes a medium. I was given to learn this from the fact that when I told a medium that others were speaking through him, and I was prompted to gaze at them, then one of them at once became a medium to the others. He was indignant that he had thus been let down into the lower realm, for now he was speaking. Therefore those become mediums who are among inward spirits, whenever others focus their thoughts on one of them: then that one comes into the world of lower spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3632</h4><p>3632. The nature of subjects is such, that when many design to speak through one, a subject is immediately made, - which it was given to know from this, that when I said to a subject that others spoke through him, and my regard was directed towards them, then one of them was immediately constituted a subject of others, who was indignant that he was thus let down into a lower sphere, and that the whole society should now speak through him. Subjects are thus made among interior spirits, and whenever others concentrate their thoughts upon one of their number, he comes into the world of inferior spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3632 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3632. Subjecta sunt talia, ut cum plures intendunt loqui per unum, tunc statim subjectum fit, quod datum scire ex eo, cum dicerem subjecto, quod alii per eum loquerentur, et data intuitione in eos, tunc unus eorum factus illico subjectum aliorum, qui indignatus, quod sic in inferiorem sphaeram demissus, quia nunc loquebatur: ita fiunt subjecta, qui inter interiores spiritus, quoties alii concentrant suas cogitationes in unum eorum, tunc venit in mundum spirituum inferiorum. </p>
