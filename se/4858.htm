<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4858</h4><p>4858. About those who pervert justice for the sake of friendship and gain<p>There were those who didn't value justice but perverted it for the sake of gain and friendship and who did so knowingly. They suffer hard times in the other life, because what is just and right is from heaven and to change this into what is unjust is to bend it toward hell. They are deprived of reason and sent among the insane. There were three who were known to me in the world (Vallerius <sup>1</sup>, L. Benzelstierna, Lilliestierna). The latter sat there as if mindless, scarcely able to think.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Gran Vallerius (d. 1744), Assessor in Swedish College of Mines. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4858</h4><p>4858. CONCERNING THOSE WHO PERVERT JUSTICE FOR THE SAKE OF FRIENDSHIP AND PROFIT.<p>There were some who have not regarded justice, but have perverted it for the sake of profit and friendship, and this knowingly. These, in the other life, suffer grievous things, because justice and right are from heaven, and to do these injustice is to bend them to hell. Reason is taken away from those [who have so acted], and they are put among the insane. There are three [of this character] who were known to me in the world (Vollerus, <sup>1</sup>Lars Benzelstierna, Lilliestie <sup>2</sup>). The last mentioned was sitting like one destitute of reason; he was scarcely able to think.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is probability in Dr. Kahl's suggestion that this is a slip of the pen for Wallerius (or Valerius) - see Narratiunculoe, p. 35 - which name occurs in No. 4830. Admitting this conjecture, however, this cannot very well be the person (Harald Wallerius) there mentioned, as he was a professor of mathematics. It is, in all probability, Goran Valerins (a son of the former one), who, as assessor in the Royal College of Mines from the year 1730, must have exercised judicial options, and thus comes within the scope of the present article. For the particulars mentioned in this note, see Dr. Tafel's Documents, pp. 711, 676.<p>2.&nbsp;Dr. Kahl suggests that Anders Lilljestierna may be the person intended. - See Narratiunculoe, p. 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4858 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4858. De illis qui justum pervertunt amicitiae et lucri causa<p>Fuerunt qui justum non aestimarunt sed perverterunt lucri et amicitiae causa, et hoc scientes, illi in altera vita dura patiuntur, quia justum et rectum est a coelo, et hoc injustum facere, est flectere ad infernum, illis adimitur ratio, et mittuntur inter insanos: sunt tres, qui mihi noti in mundo Vallerius, L. Benzelstierna, Lilliestierna), hic sedebat sicut absque ratione, vix cogitare potuit. </p>
