<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5935</h4><p>5935. About purging<p>After a spirit has completed his period of time in the world of spirits, at the end he comes to the final period which is his purging. He then appears for the most part as his nature was in the world and is sent off to go where he pleases and so comes to the point where the connection with anything spiritual is taken away. As a result he becomes foolish and casts himself into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5935</h4><p>5935. VASTATION. <p>After a spirit has completed his time in the world of spirits, he at length arrives at the last [period], which is his vastation. He then appears, for the most part, such as he was in the world, and is set at liberty to go whither he pleases; and thus he reaches a place where all conjunction with anything spiritual is taken away. He thus becomes, as it were, silly, and casts himself into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5935 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5935. De vastatione<p>Postquam spiritus in mundo spirituum suum tempus exegit, tandem venit ad ultimum, quod est vastatio ejus, tunc plerumque apparet qualis fuit in mundo, et emittitur ut eat quo libet, et sic venit ad locum, ubi conjunctio cum aliquo spirituali aufertur, sic fit sicut fatuus, et conjicit se in infernum. </p>
