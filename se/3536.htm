<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3536</h4><p>3536. Now because they are of this character due to their life's persuasion, that wherever they come they are able by the life of their persuasions as it were to corrupt other spirits in an instant when their aura begins to operate, therefore I was prompted to ask them how, if one is warm and should be packed about with ice, could one help becoming cold? or if one is in the light, and they close the windows, could one help being in darkness, and thus unable to see? </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3536</h4><p>3536. Such being the persuasions of their life, that whithersoever they come, they can, as it were, seduce other spirits by the life of their persuasions, as soon as their sphere begins to operate, it was given to ask them how, if anyone was warm and he should be surrounded with ice, he could help becoming cold? or if he was in light, and the windows should be closed, [how] he should not be enveloped in darkness, and thus unable to see? </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3536 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3536. Et quia tales sunt vitae persuasionis, ut quocunque veniunt ex sola vita persuasionum suarum alios spiritus potuerint quasi seducere, momento tamen cum operatur eorum sphaera, quare iis dicere dabatur, quomodo aliter fieri potest, si quis calescit, si gelu circumfundant eum, quod frigescat? aut si in luce sit, claudantur fenestrae, quod in obscuro et non videat? </p>
