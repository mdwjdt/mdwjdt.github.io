<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2674</h4><p>2674. They were still thinking there was something of life in them, because they are living, and experiencing pleasure, and so, that they do have a life on their own, because that life is theirs. But I was allowed to reply to them that the life within is not theirs, but it is a faculty of being able to reason and to understand what is true and good, with which human beings are endowed above the wild beasts, and is therefore properly called the human principle. It is this faculty, namely, of understanding truth and goodness, from which that smoky fieriness of theirs draws its life. 1748, 24 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2674</h4><p>2674. They still supposed that there is something of life in [them] because they live, and indeed in pleasantness, and thus that they have life from themselves, because their life is of such a nature. But it was granted to reply to them, that what is therein is not their life, but is the faculty of being able to reason and understand what is true and good, which is given to man, above the beasts, and so is properly styled the human [principle]. This faculty [to wit], of understanding the true and good, is [that] wherefrom such a smoky fiery [principle] of theirs derives its life. - 1748, July 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2674 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2674. Putabant usque quod aliquid vitae inesset, quia vivunt et quidem in jucunditate, et sic quod vitam a se habeant, quia talis vita eorum est: sed respondere iis dabatur, quod vita quae inibi est, non est eorum, sed est facultas, quod ratiocinari possint, ac intelligere quid verum et bonum, quod homini datum prae bestiis est, et sic audit proprie humanum. Haec facultas, nempe intelligendi verum et bonum, est ex qua tale eorum fumeum igneum trahit vitam suam. 1748, 24 Julius. </p>
