<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>524.在我们地球居民当中，第一个到他们那里的，是来自我们地球居民的最坏灵人之一。他无法靠近他们，他们立刻就发觉他是邪恶的，尽管他正在实施他的诡计。后来一个善灵来了；他们便接待了他，并愿意与他交谈。又有一个性情介于中间，尚未变得更好的灵人来了；他们不愿允许他进入。因此，他们能立刻察觉那些到他们这里来的人是什么性质，从而与他们保持一定距离。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 524</h4><p>524. The first from among the inhabitants of our planet to come to them was one of the worst spirits from the inhabitants of our planet. He could not approach them, for they felt at once that he was evil, even though he was practicing his cunning. Later another came who was good; him they welcomed, and liked to associate with him. Still another came, who was of an in-between character, not yet improved, and they did not want to admit him either. Thus they sense at once what those who come to them are like. So they are kept at a distance from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 524</h4><p>524. With the inhabitants of our earth who first came to them, there was a spirit who was one of the worst of the inhabitants of our earth. He was unable to draw near them. They instantly felt that he was evil, although he made use of his arts. Afterwards another came who was good; him they received and were willing to converse with him. Again another came who was of an intermediate disposition, not as yet made better; him they were unwilling to admit. In order that they may at once perceive of what quality those are who come to them, they are thus kept at a distance from them. </p>

Qui ad eos venerunt ab incolis nostri <sup>1</sup></p><p>telluris, erat primum unus pessimorum nostri <sup>2</sup></p><p>telluris incolarum spiritus, is non potuit appropinquare ad eos, sentiebant illico, quod malus esset, tametsi arte sua usus; alius postea venit, qui bonus, illum acceptabant, et cum illo volebant conversari; iterum alius qui mediae indolis erat, nondum melioratus, eum nec volebant admittere; sic ut percipiant illico, quales sint, qui ad eos veniunt, sic ad distantiam ab iis tenentur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;tellus hic ut alibi masculine dicitur<p>2.&nbsp;vide annotationem a </p>
