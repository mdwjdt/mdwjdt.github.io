<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 669</h4><p>669. There are also those who interrelate with the mouth, who likewise are afterwards transferred elsewhere. They are those who continually want to talk, from which they get their enjoyment. Insofar as that enjoyment is purified, so that they do not want to speak anything other than what is useful to their companions, to the community, to heaven, to the Lord, or insofar as the desire to regard themselves in talking, or the effort to be thought wise, passes away, so far they are raised to a more distinguished place.<p>This was shown to me today by a gold coin, which a hand representing the hand of the Lord, took and gave to one who was indignant after having been given to know that he was in the province of the mouth. <sup>1</sup>It meant that he can be transferred, and even to the region of the heart, if he is found worthy. 1748, 7 February.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original, a deleted footnote is here referred to: "He said that he had not been able to hide the coin wh..." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 669</h4><p>669. There are also those who correspond to the mouth who are likewise later transferred elsewhere, namely, those who continually want to talk, taking pleasure therein. When that pleasure is purified, so that they desire to speak nothing but what is of use to their companions, to the community, to heaven and to the Lord, or as far as the desire of regarding themselves in their speech, and of seeking to be [thought] wise, perishes, so far they are raised to a more lofty place. This was shown me today by a gold coin which a hand, representing the hand of the Lord, took and gave to one who was indignant that he was in the province of the mouth; he was given to recognize <sup>1</sup>that this signified that he was able to be transferred, and could be transferred to a place in the heart, if he was found worthy. 1748, Feb. 7. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is a sign here in the manuscript referring to the following note by the author which is crossed out: For he said he could not hide the coin wh[ich] ..." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 669 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>669. Sunt etiam qui correspondent ori, qui etiam aliunde postea transferuntur, qui nempe continue volunt loqui, in qua <sup>1</sup></p><p>voluptatem captant; cum voluptas ista purificatur, quod non aliud loqui cupiat, quam quod conducit sociis, communi, coelo, Domino, seu quantum perit cupido se spectandi in loquela, ac ambiendi quod sapiens sit, tantum evehitur sublimius. Quod mihi ostensum est hodie per nummum aureum, quem manus, repraesentans manum Domini, accipiebat, et dabat ei, qui indignabatur, quod in provincia oris esset, quod cognoscere ei datum erat, inde significans, quod transponi queat, et in locum cordis transponi. si dignus inveniatur. 1748, 7 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;hoc est qua [loquela] </p>
