<p>401.关于许可，每一件事都倾向于宇宙或所有人的利益。许可也是这样的：以为自己能力强大到足以做成任何事的灵人为自己僭取这种能力，认为他们独自就能激起人类里面的邪恶，以及其它许多不允许和非法的活动，并尝试许多方法，甚至在行奇事中所惯常用的非法的方法，因而尝试巫术而如此行。弥赛亚神从不承认这些事，但可以说祂允许他们去做。这种允许可从许多事明显看出来，如：这类灵人不断想要激起骚乱；因此，允许他们的事只是那些能有助于纠正人类、灵魂和灵人的事，其它事是不允许的；弥赛亚神如此统治和掌控其每一个和一切细节，以致这些灵人似乎经允许所做的，无不有助于许多人，因而有助于宇宙和所有人的利益。因为每个人的利益都能与宇宙所有人共享，事实上当弥赛亚的国度被牢固建立时，将会如此共享。（1747年12月25日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 401</h4><p>401. NB. NB. In regard to Permissions: every single thing tends toward the good of the universe, or of all<p>There are also permissions whereby spirits who think they are powerful enough to accomplish anything, claim to have the power on their own to arouse evils in mankind, and [engage in] other unallowable and unlawful activities, trying any of numerous methods, even unlawful ones usually employed in working wonders - thus magical arts.<p>These things God the Messiah never grants, but He is said to permit them [to do] that which, among many things, is to be permitted - as for example, their continually wanting to stir up trouble. So the only things permitted them are those which lead to the improvement of mankind, souls and spirits (other things are not permitted), each and every detail of which God the Messiah so controls and governs that there is not a whit that they do as if by permission that does not lead to the good of many, thus of the universe, and of all. For the good of each can be shared with all in the universe, and shall, in fact, be so shared, when God the Messiah's kingdom is established. 1747, the 25th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 401</h4><p>401. CONCERNING PERMISSIONS: THAT EACH SINGLE THING TENDS TO THE GOOD OF THE UNIVERSE, OR OF ALL <p>Permissions are also such that spirits, who suppose that they can do and effect all things, arrogate to themselves the power that they alone can excite evils among men, and many other things which are not allowable and are unlawful, and this by many arts which are also unlawful, by which they are wont to make signs, thus by means of magic arts. God Messiah never concedes these things, but He is said to permit them. What it is to be permitted [can be evident] from many things; as that such spirits continually want to excite disturbances; wherefore those things which are permitted them are only such as may be conducive to the emendation of man, of souls and of spirits; other things are not permitted, all and each of which God Messiah so rules and governs that there is nothing whatever that those spirits thus do as if by permission, which is not conducive to the good of many, thus to the good of the universe, consequently to the good of all; for the good of each one is communicable to all in the universe, and will indeed be communicated when the Kingdom of God Messiah shall be firmly established. 1747, Dec. 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 401 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>401. NB. NB. De Permissionibus, quod unumquodvis singulare tendat ad universi seu omnium bonum<p>Permissiones sunt tales quoque, ut spiritus, qui se putant omnia posse, et efficere, arrogent sibi eam potestatem, ut excitare mala in hominibus soli possint, ei plura, quae inconcessa sunt ac illicita, et quidem artibus pluribus, etiam illicitis, quibus solent signa facere, sic per magicas artes; haec nusquam Deus Messias concedit, sed dicitur permittere <sup>1</sup></p><p>iis, quod est [aliquid] permitti, ex pluribus, sicut quod turbas continue excitare velint, quare ea, quae iis permittuntur, sunt solum, quae ad emendationem hominis, animarum et spirituum conducunt caetera <sup>2</sup></p><p>non permittuntur quae <sup>3</sup></p><p>omnia et singula Deus Messias ita regit et gubernat, ut ne hilum sit, quod ii faciunt sic quasi permissive, quod non conducit ad multorum bonum, ita ad universi sic omnium, nam cujusvis bonum communicabile est omnibus in universo, et quidem communicabitur, quando Dei Messiae regnum constabilitur. 1747, d. 25 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript permitti ii[s] in permittere emendatum<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has conducunt, caetera<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has permittuntur, quae </p>
