Next his face was shown to me, in a light as clear as day, and in fact, just how his face had changed during his life. Around his eyes he was covered with wrinkles, and he had a quite troubled expression. His nose, which had thinned with age, was very sharp, so that hardly any nose was left but a tip. The wrinkles about the eyes had increased to the point of ugliness. He was said to have been like this in his life so that he might repent, and because of the ugliness of his face, might withdraw from his conceit; and that it was the index of his mind. 1748, 14 March. </p>

Then his face was shown me in a light like that of clear day, and indeed how his face had changed during his lifetime. It was beset with wrinkles about the eyes and was very troubled; his nose was rather pointed, and it decreased with age so that scarcely anything of it except the tip remained; the wrinkles about the eyes were increased in their deformity. It was said that he had been such during his life in order that he might then have repented and been withdrawn from his elation of mind, by reason of the deformity of his face; also, that his face was the index of his mind. 1748, Mar. 14. </p>
