<p>029.不按次序生活的恶灵也能制造快乐，因此，它们是“君王的美味”或亚设（创世记49:20）。<p>天使也照着理性信仰的多样性被划分为诸天堂，主导内在人性思维的天使也是如此，因为人拥有一个内在、更内在，甚至至内在的天堂在他周围。蒙主的神性怜悯，我得以暂时以活生生的方式与居于理解力天堂的天使分享我的思维，确切地说，通过我的思维与他们交流，通过中间人与他们对话。我甚至被允许将我的思维净化到这种程度：我能直接触及那些在信仰基于理解力的天堂中的天使。那时，我发现，他们就是“迦得”在更内在意义上所指的人。因为他们即使知道，因而能相信，唯独主通过圣灵统治他们，他们只有等到直接被唤醒时才拥有能力，却仍感到心烦意乱，起初还想引起骚乱；但与我争论一番后，他们平静下来。此外，如今蒙主的神性怜悯，我被允许以活生生的方式体验到：灵人，尽管是邪恶的，也就是说，处于颠倒的次序，也能给予“君王的美味（或快乐）”（创世记49:20）。处于这种状态下的这些灵人就是亚设在外在意义上所表示的。因为在这种状态下，他们能制造和谐的快乐，为内在天堂或内在人提供服务。这些就是此处隐藏的事。关于他们的更多详情：1747年2月8日这一天，我被允许在页边空白处记录雅各之子（创世记49章）的祝福。右下角是他对创世纪49:19-20的注释，内容如下：迦得是指更内在之人的公义，因而是指通过理解力所得信仰之公义。因为我们如每一个缺乏神性体验的人那样以为我们是我们自己的，殊不知，我们即便在最小细节上也由主掌管。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 29</h4><p>29. By evil spirits who are not living in order, delights also can be produced, so that they are "the delights of a king," or Asher [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Gen. 49:20</a>]. <sup>1</sup>[Spirit; Pleasure; Asher]<p>I could not think even the least thing, but what flowed in from the Lord. [Thought, Think; Inflow]<p>[THE "BATH FRAGMENT":] <sup>2</sup><p>....Also distinguished into heavens, according to their different kinds of mental belief, are the angels who govern inward human thoughts: for people have around them an inward, and a very inward, heaven - even an innermost one. I also was enabled by the mercy of God the Messiah actually to share my thoughts for a while with those who were in the heaven of understanding - or rather, to have contact with them through my thoughts and, by intermediaries, to speak with them. I was even allowed to purify my thoughts to the point where I directly touched those who were in the heaven of belief based on understanding. Then I saw that it was they who are meant by "Gad" in a more inward sense. For even though they know, and are therefore able to believe, that God the Messiah Alone rules them through the Holy Spirit, and that they only had power when they were directly enlivened - still they were upset and wanted at first to cause a commotion, but after some contention with me, they quieted down.<p>Moreover, I was also allowed today, by the Divine mercy of God the Messiah, actually to experience the fact that spirits, even if they are evil, that is, in upside-down order, are also able to give "the delights of a King" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Gen. 49:20</a>]. These, when they are in that state, are meant in an outward sense by "Asher," for they were able to produce harmonious pleasures, performing services to the inward heaven, or inward person.<p>These are the matters that are hidden here, and more could be said about them: 1747, the 8th day of February, on which day I was allowed to note something in the margin about the blessings of the sons of Jacob, chapter 49 of Genesis. <sup>3</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See Experiences Spirituales, Vol I, p. xxxii, locus 17.<br><br>2.&nbsp;See Experiences Spirituales, Vol I, p. xxxiii.<br><br>3.&nbsp;See Experientiae Spirituales, Vol VI, appendix E.<br><br>In the upper left hand corner of page 62 of Swedenborg's Schmidius Bible is the annotation, "About Gad and Asher, see Experiences, Tome III at the end." In the lower right hand corner are his annotations on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_19.htm">Gen. 49:19-20</a>, which read:<p>"Vers. 19.) Gad is the righteousness of the more inward person, thus of faith through understanding, in that we think we are our own, not believing we are controlled by God the Messiah in the least details, as is usual with everyone lacking Divine experience. They are the fruits of faith by understanding, thus "he whom a troop tramps upon." He "tramps upon the heel" when it is Jacob, in almost the same sense as [the prophecy] that nature tramps upon the heel, Gen. [3:15?].<p>"Vers. 20.) Asher is blessedness that is the result of loves, or Issachar, in the more inward meaning, and in the inward meaning." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 29</h4><p>29. Delights can also be produced by evil spirits who do not live in order, so that they are the "delights of a king", or Asher. (Ascher, Fucunditas, Spiritus.) I could not think even the least thing except what flowed in from God Messiah. (Cogitare, Influxus.) <p>[THE "BATH FRAGMENT"] <p>....angels also are distinguished into heavens in accordance with the varieties of intellectual faith, and so are those who rule the interior human thoughts, for man has around him a certain interior, and more interior, and even inmost heaven. It was permitted [me] by the Divine Mercy of God Messiah for a little while to share my thoughts in a living manner with those who dwell in the intellectual heaven, or to have communication with them through thoughts, and to speak with them by other means. Indeed it was given me to purify my thoughts to such a degree that those who were in the heaven of intellectual faith were brought into immediate contact. <sup>1</sup>Then it was observed that they were those who are meant in the more interior sense by Gad; for although they know, and so are able to believe, that God Messiah by the Holy Spirit alone rules them, and that they only had power as long as they were being aroused directly, yet they were upset; and at first they wanted to excite some disturbances, but after some contention with me they became quiet. Moreover, today also by the Divine mercy of God Messiah it was permitted [me] to experience in a living manner that spirits, although evil, that is to say being in an inverted order, can also give "the delights of a king" [Gen. xlix 20]. These, so long as they are in that state, are meant by Asher in the exterior sense, for they were in such a state that they might make enjoyments suitably, by rendering obedience to the interior heaven or interior man. These are matters that are arcana, and more could have been said about them. 1747, the 8th day of February, on which day it was permitted [me] to note something in the margin concerning the blessings of the sons of Jacob, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_1.htm">Genesis chap. xlix</a>. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Crossed out "who, being aroused, spoke with me today, by means of other spirits". <p>2.&nbsp;The note is: "Concerning Gad and Asher, see the experience in Tome III (of The Word Explained (Cod. 61) at the end." </p>
