<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4562</h4><p>4562. About fortune<p>Inflow<p>I have very often spoken with spirits and angels about luck, which in the world appears as if it were accidental because people don't know where it comes from, and because everything of luck appears as accidental except for what people ascribe to themselves and their own prudence. To this they also bend it and ascribe nothing to the Divine. Frequently something has happened to me that appeared to be a matter of chance, as for instance trivial misfortunes. And it was then shown by the angels that they had happened because this or that kind of spirits had been present and because their aura was prevailing over the aura coming from heaven, thus from the Divine, which was vividly demonstrated. Evil spirits as well, using their arts created an aura, and when they made it present, misfortunes happened, entirely as if they were accidents or mishaps. Because of this I also realized that everything and the very least details of everything are directed by the Divine Providence, even down to the least step and nod of the head, and that when such a thing prevails as strives against the inflow from the Divine, misfortune occurs. But the misfortune is such that it concerns the eternal blessedness and happiness of the person, not such things as are in the world; for these appear to those who are in the world as causes of happiness when yet they are harmful. I have been instructed by many experiences, which I cannot recount here, that luck and chance come from this, and that there is nothing accidental. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4562</h4><p>4562. CONCERNING FORTUNE. INFLUX.<p>(Very often have I spoken with spirits and angels concerning fortune, which, in the world, appears as if accidental, because [men] do not know whence it is, and because everything of fortune appears as if accidental; because, moreover, man attributes it to himself and his own prudence - to, which, also, he bends it - and attributes nothing to the Divine. Very often there had happened to me such an experience as appears as if it were of fortune - as, for instance, trifling misfortunes - and it was afterwards shown, by angels, that they happened because spirits of such a kind [as bring about misfortune] were present; and also because their sphere prevailed against the sphere which was from heaven, thus from the Divine. It was shown to the life. Moreover, evil spirits, by means of their arts, acquired a sphere; and, when they had accomplished this, misfortunes arose, just like accidents or mishaps. Thence, also, it was perceived, that all things, and the least parts of all things, are directed by Divine Providence, even as to the slightest step and slightest nod; and that when such a state prevails as is contrary to the influx from the Divine, misfortune happens. But [real] misfortune is such as concerns man's eternal happiness and felicity, and not that which concerns such things as are in the world; for these appear to man as happy when yet they are hurtful. That fortunate and fortuitous things are thence, and that there is no accident [strictly so-called], I was instructed by many experiences, which I cannot here adduce.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4562 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4562. De fortuna<p>Influxus<p>Saepius loquutus cum spiritibus et angelis de fortuna, quae in mundo apparet sicut fortuitum, quia non sciunt unde, et quia omne fortunae sicut fortuitum apparet, praeter [id] quod homo sibi suaeque prudentiae tribuit, quo etiam ectit illud, et nihil tribuit Divino; saepius acciderat mihi tale quod ut fortunae apparet, ut infortunata levia, et ostensum dein ab angelis, quod acciderint quia tales spiritus aderant, etiam quia sphaera eorum praevalebat contra sphaeram quae a coelo, ita a Divino, [quod] ad vivum ostensum est; etiam mali spiritus per artes suas invenerunt sphaeram quam cum sisterent, infortunata, prorsus sicut fortuita seu casus existerent, inde quoque perceptum, quod omnia et omnium minima dirigantur a Providentia Divina, etiam quoad minimum gressum et minimum nutum, et quod cum tale praevalet quod contranititur influxui a Divino quod infortunatum accidat, sed infortunatum est tale quod concernit beatitudinem et felicitatem hominis aeternam, non autem quod concernit talia quae in mundo, nam haec apparent homini ut felicia, cum tamen sunt damnosa; quod inde fortunata seu fortuita, et quod nullus casus sit, a pluribus experientiis instructus sum, quas hic adducere non possum. </p>
