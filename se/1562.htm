<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1562</h4><p>1562. About a general mental image, into which distinct mental images of others flowed<p>I was absorbed in a general mental image, which is almost an idea of everything without concentration upon anything specific. Nor am I able to describe it, because [while] this kind of mental image can be understood in the spiritual world and can indeed exist with others, that is, people on earth, yet it cannot be understood by them.<p>Into this general mental image flowed the particular or individual ones of spirits, which I understood quite clearly in a general way, while remaining absorbed in the general mental image. Thus [did I learn] that individual mental images flowed in from others, and I understood them. I was told that this [general one] is what the idea of some spirits is like. 1748, 20 March.<p>[1562 1/2.] From this it is clear that general mental images are distinct unto themselves, distinct from individual ones. And individual mental images are in a general one; yet they are unaware of being in a general one. But this general mental image was not focused to cause individual things to attach themselves to it, because [...] <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This unfinished and unnumbered paragraph appears to have been deleted in the original. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1562</h4><p>1562. CONCERNING A COMMON [OR GENERAL] IDEA INTO WHICH FLOWED THE DISTINCT IDEAS OF OTHERS. <p>Being in a common [or general] idea, which was, as it were, the idea of all, without determination to anything definite, there appeared to me [an idea] which I am unable to describe, inasmuch as it is only in the spiritual world that such an idea can be perceived. It may exist, indeed, with some men [in this world], but it is not perceived. Into this idea there flowed the particular or singular ideas of spirits, which I understood with considerable distinctness in general, remaining myself meanwhile in a general idea. In this way singular ideas from others would flow in, and I could understand them. It was said to me that such is the idea of certain spirits. - 1748, March 20. <p>(Hence it may appear that general ideas are in themselves distinct from singular ones, and yet the singular exist in the general, though singulars do not know that they are in the general. This general idea was not sufficiently determinate for singular things to apply themselves to it.) </p>

De idea communi, in quam distinctae aliorum influebant<p>Eram in idea communi, quae est quasi omnium, absque determinatione ad aliquod certum, quam <sup>1</sup></p><p>describere nec possum, quia in spirituali mundo talis percipi potest, dari quidem apud alios, nempe homines, sed non [ab iis] percipi, in hanc ideam influebant particulares seu singulares spirituum, quas intelligebam distincte satis in communi, me permanente in communi, sic quod ideae singulares ab aliis influerent, et eas intelligerem; dicebatur mihi quod talis idea sit quorundam spirituum. 1748, 20 Martius.<p>1562a. Inde constare potest, quod ideae communes in se distinctae sint, a singularibus, et singulares sint in communi, et quod singulares non sciant, quod in communi sint, sed hic communis idea, non erat determinata, ut se ei adplicarent singularia, quia [...] <sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has apparuit mihi quam<p>1.&nbsp;paragraphus haec inabsoluta ac non numerata forte potius delenda est </p>
