<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4042</h4><p>4042. That it was a directing of the vessels of the memory alone, was evident, so that when vessels of the memory are directed, the spirit who is speaking cannot speak otherwise. I experienced this also through spirits, that they would arrange the vessels of the memory more imperceptibly or more tightly, and then the [medium] spirits could not speak otherwise either. But when some others wanted to speak from themselves, then something indescribably sad and unfortunate was felt. This shows that there is a continual arranging of the vessels of man's bodily memory, for as the vessels are arranged, so the spirits speak, and so and not otherwise those are able to think who are nearest by. For the vessels of the memory are planes in which mental imagery becomes fixed, and if they are not suitable, they cannot receive, and as far as they are suitable, so far they receive. The mental images of the spirits nearest by are so to speak bound to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4042</h4><p>4042. That this was merely a directing of the vessels of the memory plainly appeared, as while the vessels of the memory are directed the spirit who speaks cannot speak otherwise. It was proved also by experience in the case of spirits, that they would imperceptibly and quickly dispose the vessels of the memory, when the spirits [acted upon] could not speak otherwise, than according [to the influence]; when they attempted it others would act upon them, and there was then perceived something unpleasant and untoward [or abortive] which cannot be described. Hence it is evident, that there is a constant disposition of the vessels of man's corporeal memory, for as the vessels are disposed, so spirits speak, and so it is also that those who are in proximity cannot think otherwise, for the vessels of the memory are planes into which ideas are determined, which vessels, if they are not fitted, cannot receive, and as they are fitted, so they receive. The ideas of the proximate spirits are, as it were, bound to these. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4042 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4042. Quod esset sola vasorum memoriae directio constabat, sic ut dum diriguntur vasa memoriae, spiritus qui loquitur, non aliter possit loqui; expertum hoc quoque per spiritus, quod imperceptibilius seu arctius disponerent vasa memoriae, tunc spiritus nec aliter potuerunt loqui; at cum vellent ex se, alii, tunc perceptum aliquod quod describi nequit triste, nec succedens: inde constat, quod continua vasorum memoriae corporeae hominis dispositio sit, nam prout disponuntur vasa, ita loquuntur spiritus, et ita nec aliter possunt cogitare, qui proximi sunt; nam vasa memoriae sunt plana in quibus determinantur ideae, quae si non aptata sint, non possunt recipere, et quomodo aptata sunt, ita recipiunt, spirituum proximorum ideae iis quasi </p>
