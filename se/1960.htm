<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1960</h4><p>1960. What the fig leaf is with which Adam girded himself<p>I spoke with spirits about the fig leaf Adam girded himself with [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_7.htm">Gen. 3:7</a>], and it was confirmed that it symbolized earthly knowledge, or faith based on reason or understanding, beneath which was nakedness, that is, filthy loves, which were concealed by that leaf. 1748, 14 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1960</h4><p>1960. <sup>1</sup>WITH WAS DENOTED BY THE FIG-TREE LEAF, WITH WHICH ADAM GIRDED HIMSELF. <p>Conversing with spirits concerning the fig-tree leaf, with which Adam girt himself around, it was confirmed to me that it signified their natural thoughts, or rational, or intellectual faith, under which were the nakednesses or filthy loves that were covered by such a fig-leaf. - 1748, May 14. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Dr. Tafel remarks that he has transposed Nos. 1960 and 1961, which he has indicated by the dotted circlets. This is evidently required by the connection. </p>
