Moreover, it seemed to me at that time that I was in that glory as to the head, but not as to the body - but in such a way that I was without a head, which had diffused itself into their common head, while the body was below that realm. From this it was granted me to learn how they who are in heaven are able to hear and see those things that come forth in the realm of spirits, namely, as being remote from them, and below them, nor are they allowed to see and know anything but what it pleases the Lord [to show them]. </p>

Moreover, it then also seemed to me that I was in that glory with my head, but not with my body, but in such a way that I was without a head which diffused itself into their common sphere with the body beneath it.

It is not granted them to perceive and know anything else than what is well-pleasing to the Lord. </p>
