<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第266节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>266.有一个灵人的社群，其中一些灵人在人的头部，一些在外面，这些事物相对应。我有时发现，当某些灵人在我外面，还与我说话时，并且当他们如此囚禁我，以致我无法摆脱他们（这种事在我身上发生过几次）时，他们同时在我的头部，要么在大脑里面，要么在大脑外面，有自己的备用灵人或成群结队的灵人。我得以通过明显的经历观察这一点，因为当在我外面，正与我说话的灵人被丢了下去时，在头里面的灵人就涌出去，事实上还发出一种像某种东西通过耳朵出去，并被推出的声音。由此明显可知，那里的灵人有很多，有时十个、二十个，或更多或更少，似乎被那些在外面、与他们仿佛在社群中被捆在一起的灵人以这种方式拉出去。由此也可以断定一个人如何被邪恶的灵人团伙捆绑，他们既在人里面，也在人外面。因此，他们关闭天使的运作。然而，天使的运作仍以一种神奇的方式悄悄进入，就像行动中的更内在的行动；所以此人得以理解真理与良善，只是很困难。（1747年11月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 266</h4><p>266. There is a group of spirits, some of whom are in a person's head, and some outside, and these interact<p>At times I have observed, when certain spirits were outside [of me] and also speaking with me, and when they were thus holding me captive so that I could not get away from them, which has happened to me several times, then at the same time they also had their auxiliary spirits or troops in the head, either within or outside the brain. It was granted me to observe this by manifest experience, for when those outside with whom I was speaking were cast down, then the ones in the head flowed out, and indeed with a sound like something going out, and being pushed out, through the ear. It was evident that there were many, from the fact that now and then ten, twenty, more or less, seemed to be drawn out in this way by those who were outside and with whom they were as if bound together in society.<p>It can also be inferred from this how a person is kept bound by an evil band of spirits, and that they are within as well as outside of the person, thus closing off the operation of angels. Nevertheless, the angels' operation slips in in a wonderful way like a more inward activity within an action, and so, the person is given to understand what is true and good, although with difficulty. 1747, the 24th day of November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 266</h4><p>266. THAT THERE IS A SOCIETY OF SPIRITS, SOME OF WHOM ARE IN MAN'S HEAD, AND SOME OUTSIDE; AND THESE THINGS CORRESPOND <p>I have sometimes observed when certain spirits were outside and also speaking with me, and while they held me captive so that I could not be loosened from them, which sometimes happened to me, they then at the same time also had their auxiliary spirits or troops in my head, either within or outside the brain. It was granted me to observe this by manifest experience, for when those who were outside of me, and with whom I was speaking, were cast down, then those who were in the head flowed forth, and indeed, with a kind of sound as of someone going out and of an expulsion through the ear. Hence it was evident that there were many spirits there, and that sometimes ten, twenty, more or less, were as it were drawn forth in that manner by those who were outside, and with whom they were as if coagulated in society. From this it can also be concluded how man is held bound by the evil crowd of spirits, and that they are both within and outside him. Hence they shut out the operation of the angels, whose operation, nevertheless, is insinuated in a marvelous manner, like the more interior action in action; and so it is given man to understand what is true and good, but with difficulty. 1747, Nov. 24, o.s. </p>
