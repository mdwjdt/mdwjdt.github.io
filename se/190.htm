<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>190.灵人没有听见或明白所思想的事。今天，有许多灵人在场，正如我凭感觉所明显觉察到的，我被允许写一些关于内在人和外在人的东西。但后来有一个灵人对我说，所思、所写的东西，他一点也不明白。因此，我通过经历被教导：除了与自己一致的事物外，灵人觉察不到任何其它事物；并且当弥赛亚神乐意时，对即将来临的事物的一切理解会与他们隔绝。</p>

Spirits had not heard or understood the thoughts<p>Today I was allowed to write something about the inner and outer person when very many spirits were present, as I clearly realized by sense. But afterwards I was told by one of them that he had understood nothing of what had been thought and written. I was thus taught by experience that spirits could not perceive any but such things as agreed with them, and that all understanding of the matters at hand would be cut off from them when it so pleases God the Messiah. 1747, the 31st day of August (old calendar). </p>

THAT SPIRITS DID NOT HEAR OR UNDERSTAND THE THINGS WHICH WERE THOUGHT <p>Today, when very many spirits were present, as I manifestly perceived by sensation, I was allowed to write <sup>1</sup>something concerning the internal and external man, but it was afterwards said to me by a certain spirit that he had perceived nothing of the things thought and written. Hence I was taught by experience that spirits could not perceive anything else than such things as are in agreement with themselves, and they were shut off from any understanding of the matters presented, when it so pleased God Messiah. 1747, Aug. 31, o.s. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Index Biblicus at Isaiah xxxvi.
