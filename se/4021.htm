<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4021</h4><p>4021. About faith and good works<p>Among those who contend that faith saves without good works [3979 ff.], I spoke with one, leading with the question whether it is not true that saving faith cannot exist without love, which he affirmed. Later, I asked whether love can exist without good works. At this he hesitated as to whether he thought of works separated from love, and because he knew that if he had given everything he possesses to the poor, and there is not love, it would amount to nothing, he understood this, and the implication that saving faith belongs to love, and that love without good works is not possible - well as that faith without good works is no faith, because it is only a gazing. For to posit a faith without good works is to posit it also without love. He seemed to maintain that love pertains to faith, not that faith pertains to love. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4021</h4><p>4021. CONCERNING FAITH AND GOOD WORKS.<p>Among those who contend that faith without good works is saving, I spoke with one, asking him if it was not true that a saving faith cannot be given without love, which he affirmed; afterwards I inquired whether love could be given without good works, on which he hesitated, because he thought of works separate from love, and because he knew that if he should have given all his goods to the poor, and yet had not love, it would amount to nothing; this he comprehended, and thence the inference, that a saving faith is of love, and that love without good works cannot exist, -as also, that faith without good works is no faith at all, as being a mere speculative [intuitiva] faith, for to suppose a faith without good works is to suppose it without love. He seemed willing to admit that love was of faith, but not that faith was of love. - 1748, November 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4021 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4021. De fide et bonis operibus<p>Qui propugnant fidem salvare absque bonis operibus [3979 ff.], cum eo loquutus iterum, ducens, annon verum est quod fides salvifica non possit dari absque amore, quod affirmabat; postea, an amor dari queat absque bonis operibus; in eo haesitabat, quin opera separata ab amore, cogitabat, et quia novit, quod si dedisset omnia quae possidet pauperibus, et non sit amor, quod usque nihil esset, hoc comprehendebat, inde deductio, quod fides salvifica sit amoris, et amor absque bonis operibus non dari queat; tum quod fides absque bonis operibus sit nulla fides, quae fides intuitiva est, quia cum ponitur absque bonis operibus, ponitur etiam absque amore: videbatur velle, quod amor esset fidei, non quod fides sit amoris. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
