<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2651</h4><p>2651. People in one city, and in one place, can nevertheless as to their spirit each be allotted an entirely different place among spirits<p>Just as it is clear that spirits in the other life, in whatever place on earth their bodies died, and in whatever place they may be, are nevertheless allotted places in the greatest body according to their qualities or abilities, the same applies to people on earth as to their spirits - neither does it make any difference that they are in one place, or that one is a friend of another. One can be in hell, among the unhappy, the other in the inward realm of upright spirits, one overhead the other below, one to the left the other to the right. Their place [on earth] does not at all determine where they are.<p>Since this is the truth, there should be no arguing about the truth of a matter for this or that reason; and if no explanations are found, the truth is not to be weakened or denied, as usually happens, but because it is the truth, it is to be believed. And if they want to investigate reasons, they may do so, it is not forbidden, only beware if they do not find a reason, or if then many insolubles stream in, that the truth is not on that account to be denied. It is just as with nearly everything in nature that we see with the eyes and grasp with the senses-if everything were to be denied because the explanations of them have not been discovered, there would be no natural truth, in any kingdom. 1748, 19 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2651</h4><p>2651. THAT ALTHOUGH MEN MAY BE IN THE SAME CITY, AND IN THE SAME PLACE, YET EVERYONE MAY BE ALLOTTED ACCORDING TO HIS SPIRIT QUITE DIFFERENT PLACES AMONGST SPIRITS. <p>(For instance, it is apparent that spirits in the other life, in whatever place in the world their dead bodies may be, and wherever their places are, still receive a situation in the Grand Man [Maximo Corpore] according to their qualities or faculties. It is similar with men upon earth; nothing causes their spirits to be in one place: for instance, of two friends, one may be in hell amongst the unhappy, the other in the interior sphere of upright spirits, one above the head, the other below, one on the left, the other on the right: the place where they are [in the world] effects nothing.) Since this is the truth there should be no arguing concerning the truth of the thing from causes, and if no causes may be discovered that the truth to be weakened or denied as is usual, but because it is the truth it should be believed; and if they wish to find out causes they may do so: it is not forbidden; only if they do not find out the cause, or if then many things inflow which cannot be explained, the truth is not on that account to be denied: it is just as in nearly everything in nature which we see with the eyes and apprehend by sense if all things were denied, because causes are not found out, there would be no natural truth in any kingdom. - 1748, July 19. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2651 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2651. Quod homines in una urbe, inque uno loco, usque [quoad] eorum spiritum, quisque potest prorsus alium locum, inter spiritus, esse sortiti <sup>1</sup></p><p>Sicut constat, quod spiritus, in altera vita, ubicunque loci in tellure mortua eorum corpora, et ii ubicunque loci sint, usque situm in corpore maximo sortiantur secundum eorum qualitates seu facultates, similiter homines in terra, eorum spiritus [sortiuntur situm], nec quicquam facit, quod in uno loco sint, sicut quod unus amicus alterius: unus potest in inferno esse, inter infelices, alter in interiori sphaera proborum spirituum, unus supra caput alter infra, unus a sinistro alter a dextro, locus, nihil efficit, ubi sunt. Hoc cum veritas, non ratiocinandum de veritate rei ex ausis, et si causae nullae inveniantur, infirmanda aut neganda veritas, ut solet, sed quia veritas, credenda <sup>2</sup></p><p>; sique causas velint investigare, id possint, non prohibetur, modo ne si causam non inveniunt, aut tunc plura influunt nonsolubilia, ideo non veritas neganda {a}; sicut in omnibus fere in natura, quae oculis videmus et sensu capimus, si omnia negarentur, quia non causae inveniuntur, nihil esset verum naturale, in ullo regno. 1748, 19 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic manuscript; vide praefationem hujus editionis sub capite "Idiosyncrasies"<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has veritas credenda </p>
