Moreover, there were two overhead speaking with me, and I was told and realized that it was Aristotle and another, whom it was not given to recognize. He spoke quite clearly, like one who had been in the spiritual world for a long time. I spoke now with him, now with those who were at the left ear, and of course about these matters.
