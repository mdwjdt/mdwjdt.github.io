<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1296</h4><p>1296. More about the black murdering spirit<p>Because that spirit [<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>] could not be let down into one of those hells, he was left free in the heaven of spirits, and in fact quite high above the forehead, for in his bodily life he had wanted to become great. But before he did, he died-perhaps because he was well known, and was not of good character. And one's character shows itself to human society, no matter how much it is concealed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1296</h4><p>1296. MORE CONCERNING THE BLACK MURDERER <p>Because that spirit [see n. <a href="../se/1293.htm">1293</a> could not be sent down into one of those hells, he was left free in the heaven of spirits, and indeed at some height above the forehead; for in the life of his body he had desired to become great, but before he became so, he died, perhaps because he was notorious and not of good character, which becomes evident in the society of men, however it may be concealed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1296 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1296. De spiritu nigro homicida, porro<p>Quia spiritus iste [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1296/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1293" target=_top>1293</a>] non dimitti potuit in unum istorum infernorum, liber in coelo spirituum relictus quidem satis alte supra frontispicium, nam in vita corporis magnus fieri cupivit; sed prius quam factus, est mortuus, forte, quia notus characteris non boni, qui, utcunque celatur, hominum societati patet. </p>
