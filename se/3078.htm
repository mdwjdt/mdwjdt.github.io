<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3078</h4><p>3078. At the same time, I was also inspired to tell evil spirits that their life is no different than the life of wild animals. For evil spirits act out of instinct, not knowing otherwise than that they are living life-like wild animals, which also act out of instinct. In one respect the life of evil spirits is worse and darker than wild animal life: they are carried by instinct against goodness and truth, which they derive from the fact, or which soul they derive from the fact that they had been born human beings. 1748, 6 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3078</h4><p>3078. At the same, it was then also given to say to evil spirits, that their life is no other than a life of beasts, for they act from instinct, and do not know other than that they live a life just like wild animals, which also act from instinct. The beast life [ferina vita] of evil spirits is worse and more obscure in this, that they are borne by instinct against the good, and the tone which they derive, or which soul they derive from their being born [as] men. - 1748, September 6. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3078 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3078. Simul etiam malis spiritibus tunc dabatur dicere, quod eorum vita non aliter sit quam ferarum vita, nam ex instinctu agunt, nec sciunt aliter quam quod vitam vivant, sicut fera animalia, quae quoque ex instinctu agunt; in eo ferina vita pejor et obscurior est [vita] spirituum malorum, quod instinctu ferantur contra bonum et verum, quod trahunt ab eo, seu quam animam trahunt ab eo, quod homines nati sint. 1748, 6 Sept. </p>
