<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>391.关于那些对他人使用暴力并以压迫他们为乐的人所受的折磨；因而关于流人血、暴力和压迫所归与的那些人（参看377节）。肉身生命结束后，由于类似生命的幻想仍旧继续，他们的内在品质通过这些幻想显示出来，所以那些无论出于什么样的驱使欲望而对邻舍施暴和压迫的人，在地狱里以下面的方式受折磨：他们迫不及待地带走他们幻想自己正在抓住的那些人，把他们撕成碎片，屠杀他们，用斧头砍他们，并以上千种不同方式折磨他们。那些嗜血的人以流人血为最大快乐，他们所施加的折磨越大，他们享受的快乐就越大；他们声称这些快乐如此之大，以致他们说，这快乐超越一切快乐。但是，这些人反过来又受到同伴们同样的折磨，他们的同伴也以同样的方式感到快乐；他们以这种方式受到折磨，并且持续很长一段时间，直到他们的同伴停止为止；由于报复的恐惧抓住他们，所以这种快乐最终会消失；因此，他们最终会摆脱它。（1747年12月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 391</h4><p>391. <sup>1</sup>About the torment of those who use violence against others, and feel joy in oppressing them; thus about those to whom is ascribed blood, violence, oppression [see <a href="377.htm">377</a>]<p>After life in the body, since life-like fantasies continue by which their inward qualities show themselves, therefore they who are violent and oppressors of their fellow man, no matter what the driving passion, are tormented in hell in the following way.<p>With the greatest eagerness, they take those whom they fantasize that they are seizing, and tear them apart, slaughter them, chop them up with an axe, and torment them in a thousand different ways. Those who are bloodthirsty derive the greatest joy from blood, and the greater the torture, the greater is their enjoyment, which is held out to be so great among them that they say it surpasses all enjoyments.<p>But then these in turn are exposed to the same torment by their companions, who are thereby, in their turn, gladdened in the same way, even until the former have been so tormented, and for such a long time, that they desist; and because a dread of retaliation seizes them, that enjoyment at length passes away, and so they are finally rid of it. 1747, the 24th day of December.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;390 is lacking in the original. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 391</h4><p>391. CONCERNING THE TORMENT OF THOSE WHO USE VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS, AND HENCE REJOICE IN OPPRESSING: THUS CONCERNING THOSE OF WHOM BLOOD, VIOLENCE, AND OPPRESSION ARE PREDICATED <p>Because corresponding phantasies remain after the life of the body, and their interiors are then laid open, therefore those who are violent and oppressors of the neighbor from cupidity of any kind, are so tormented in hell, that with the greatest cupidity, those whom they take by phantasy, they tear in pieces, slay, cut with an axe, and torment in a thousand other ways. With those who are blood-thirsty, and especially delight in blood, the greater the torment [they inflict] the greater the delight, which with them is declared to be so great, that they say it exceeds all delights. But these are in their turn exposed to similar torments by their companions, who thereby are made glad in like manner, and they are tormented in this way, and for so long, even until they desist; and since the horror of retaliation takes possession of them, that delight at length perishes; thus they are finally devastated. 1747, Dec. 24. </p>
