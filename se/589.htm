<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第589节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>589.关于木星恶灵所受的一种惩罚。他们当中最坏的所受的一种惩罚被指给我看。他们被囚在一个大酒桶里，被捆绑得根本无法移动。与此同时，他们被囚禁的可怕幻象所侵扰，摆脱囚禁的渴望被激发；由于这是徒劳的，所以这种渴望带有焦虑和折磨；他们被告知，他们必须忍受这些东西，直到他们偿还一切，甚至还清最后一文钱为止（马太福音5:26）。即便如此，他们还是被释放了。他们的脸呈现在我面前；这脸是丑陋、畸形的，可以说被撕裂了。这种惩罚对应于地狱团伙的幻觉，即：他们在一种大酒桶里（285-86节）；还有头巾的惩罚，如前所述（434-5,516节）。据说那时他们受到痛苦的折磨，但被告知，如果他们还清最后一文钱，那就要花永远的时间。因此，独一主在我们地球上承受了最残酷的折磨，为使他们可以忍受一点点时间后被释放。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 589</h4><p>589. About one kind of punishment of the evil spirits from the planet Jupiter<p>A kind of punishment that their worst undergo was shown to me. They are held as if in a tub, so bound up that they cannot move themselves at all. Meanwhile, they are troubled by dreadful fantasies about their own imprisonment, and a longing is aroused to come forth from their bonds. This being futile, the longing is joined by anxiety and torment, and they are told that they must bear these things until they have paid everything, even to "the last farthing" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_26.htm">Matt. 5:26</a>]. Even so, they are set free. The appearance of their face was brought before me, and it was ugly, and as if it had been torn apart.<p>This punishment corresponds to both of the fantasies of the hellish crowd, that of being in a kind of tub [285-286], and also that of punishment by a veil, spoken about earlier [534-535]. It is said that they are then tormented miserably; but they were told that if they had paid the very last farthing, it would have taken forever. It was for this reason that the One Only Lord bore the cruelest tortures on our earth, in order that they may thus be freed, when yet they have borne this for only a dot of time. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 589</h4><p>589. CONCERNING A CERTAIN KIND OF PUNISHMENT INFLICTED UPON THE EVIL SPIRITS OF THE PLANET JUPITER <p>I was shown a certain punishment which the worst of them suffer. They are kept as it were in a tun, so bound that they are unable to move themselves at all, and in the meanwhile they are infested by dire phantasies about their incarceration, and the desire of releasing themselves from their bonds is excited, and because this is in vain there is thence anxiety and torment with the desire; and they are told that they ought to bear these things even until they have paid everything to the last farthing [Matt. v. 26]. But still they are liberated. <sup>1</sup>The appearance of their face was exhibited to me; it was deformed, and as it were lacerated. This punishment agrees also with the phantasies of the infernal crew that they are in a certain tun; also with the punishment of the veil. See above [nos. <a href="../se/434.htm">434-435</a>, <a href="../se/516.htm">516</a>. They are then said to be miserably tormented, but they are told that if they should pay to the last farthing, it would be to eternity. Wherefore the one only Lord sustained the most cruel torments on our earth, so that they might be delivered after they have borne it for only a very little time. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong> <p>1.&nbsp;In the Index (s.v. Velum) it is said, "and when without hope, they are liberated". </p>
