<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2296</h4><p>2296. In all things that happen there is the Permission, Grace, Good Pleasure, and Will of the Lord, depending on those concerned<p>I was inspired to make a distinction between permissions (which likewise can be divided up into kinds and species), then acts of grace (which pertain to good spirits), then acts of good pleasure (which pertain to angels), and to distinguish all these into kinds and species.<p>Now since the will of the Lord prevails in all things down to the very least, because He controls all things, therefore there are acts of good pleasure, grace, or permission, depending on those concerned. Therefore when several are thinking, speaking or doing the same thing, one may do so by permission, a second by grace, a third by good pleasure, for all and the very least things happen for a purpose. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2296</h4><p>2296. THAT PERMISSION, LEAVE [venia], GOOD PLEASURE, AND THE WILL OF THE LORD ARE IN ALL THINGS WHICH HAPPEN, BUT HAVE A RELATION [APPLICATE] TO SUBJECTS. <p>It was given to make a distinction amongst permissions, which are divided also into genera, and these into species as also (to distinguish) amongst leaves [venias] which belong to good spirits, and amongst leaves [venias] which belong to angels, and [to divide] all into genera and species. Inasmuch now, as the will of the Lord reigns in each and all things, for He rules all things, therefore good pleasures, leaves, and permissions, are circumstanced according to subjects, like as when many think, speak, or do the same thing; one acts from permission, another from leave, a third from good pleasure, for each and all things are from an end. - I 748, June 11. </p>

Quod Permissio, Venia, Beneplacitum, ac Voluntas Domini in omnibus sint, quae fiunt, sed applicate ad subjecta<p>Distinguere datum est inter permissiones, quae quoque in genera, et haec in species dispescendae <sup>1</sup></p><p>, tum inter venias, quae sunt bonorum spirituum, inter beneplacita, quae sunt angelorum; et omnia in genera et species; quia nunc voluntas Domini regnat in omnibus et singulis, quia regit omnia, ita se habent beneplacita, veniae, et permissiones secundum subjecta; sic ut cum plures idem cogitent, loquantur aut agant <sup>2</sup></p><p>, unus ex permissione, alter ex venia, tertius ex beneplacito agat, nam omnia et singula ex fine. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;valde imperfectum in the Manuscript; in J.F.I.
