<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4604</h4><p>4604. About Inflow<p>To all appearances the outer senses of the body, as for instance sight and hearing, flow into the thought and arouse mental imagery there, for it appears that objects first move the outer senses and then the inner ones; and also speech. But even though this appearance may be so strong that it hardly seems possible for it to be dispelled, it is nevertheless a fallacy, for an outer quality that is gross can never flow into an inner one which is purer; this is contrary to nature.</p><p>[2] It is rather the inner sense that feels through the outer sense and disposes the organ of sensation at its nod, so that the organ of sensation also, such as of sight, accommodates itself in a moment to all objects. It does not do this from its own power, but by virtue of the inflow from within. Moreover, the thought and feeling, which pertains to the inner sense, directs the sight to objects, which it fully comprehends, and that coincide [with it]; the rest lie beyond and do not appear. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4604</h4><p>4604. CONCERNING INFLUX.<p>(It is according to all appearance that the external senses of the body, as for instance sight and hearing, inflow into the thought, and there call forth ideas; for it appears as if objects first stir the external senses, and thus the internal; and speech likewise. But, no matter even though this appearance is so strong that it seems hardly possible to be got rid of, yet is it a fallacy all the while; for the external, which is gross, can never inflow into the internal, which is purer; this is contrary to nature; but it is the internal sense, which, by means of the external sense, feels, and disposes the sensorium for receiving [the feeling] according to its nature. Wherefore, the sensorium - for instance of sight - adapts itself in a moment to all objects, which it does not from itself, but from influx out of the interior; and, moreover, thought and affection, which belong to the internal sense, determine the sight to objects, which that sense fully grasps, and which are coordinate with it. Other objects [i. e., those not co-ordinate, or on the same level with the sensorium involved], transcend it and do not appear. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4604 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4604. De Influxu<p>Secundum omnem apparentiam est, quod sensus externi corporis, sicut visus et auris, influant in cogitationem, et excitent ibi ideas, nam apparet quod objecta moveant sensus primum externos, et sic internos; et quoque loquela; sed utcunque haec apparentia tam fortis sit, ut vix videatur posse discuti, usque tamen est fallacia, externum enim quod crassum nusquam influere potest in internum quod purius, hoc contra naturam est, sed est sensus internus qui per sensum externum sentit, et disponit sensorium, ad recipiendum secundum suum nutum, quapropter etiam sensorium, ut visus, se accommodat momento ad omnia objecta, quod non facit ex se, sed ex influxu ab interiori: et praeterea, cogitatio et affectio, quae est interni sensus, determinat visum ad objecta, quae plene capit, quae coincidunt, caetera transcendunt et non apparent. </p>
