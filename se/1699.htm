<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1699</h4><p>1699. About the quarters<p>It is amazing that in the world of spirits, as also in the heavens, the very least qualities that occur and whatever kinds and species, keep to their own quarters, without ever changing them. When any spirits, or any angels, become present, or when anything appears, this happens each in its own fixed quarter. The quarters have relation to the human body, and when one knows where they are in relation to the body, one can tell who they are and what they are like. And even though dissimilar qualities do appear in the same quarter, still it can be learned unmistakably from other indications what something is, and what the spirits are like: for instance, [one knows] where the swamp is, where Gehenna is, where the unclean spirits are who are in the waste barrel, who constitute [the province of] the colon, and so on in all other cases. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1699</h4><p>1699. CONCERNING THE QUARTERS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>It is wonderful that in the world of spirits, and also in the heavens, everything that takes place, and all the genera and species of things, wherever they may be, maintain their own quarters without ever changing them; so that while any spirit or any angels appear, or anything occurs, it takes place, in regard to each, in its own fixed quarter. These quarters have respect to the human body. When it is known where [spirits] are relatively to the body, it may be known who they are, and of what quality; and although dissimilar things may exist in the same quarter, yet from other signs it may be known what and of what quality they are, and that too without mistake. Thus wherever the lake is, wherever Gehenna, wherever unclean spirits are, or those who are in the ton, or who constitute the colon [there certain quarters are to be recognized], and so in all other particulars. </p>

De plagis<p>Mirabile est, quod in mundo spirituum, ita quoque in coelis, singula quae fiunt, et ubicunque <sup>1</sup></p><p>sunt genera et species, teneant suas plagas, sic ut nusquam eas mutent; ita ut dum quidam <sup>2</sup></p><p>spiritus, aut aliqui angeli comparent, aut quicquam existit, in suismet certis plagis fiant, plagae se habent respective ad corpus humanum, quando cognoscitur ubinam sunt, respective ad corpus, sciri potest, quinam sint, et quales sint; tametsi quoque dissimilia in eadem plaga existunt, usque <sup>3</sup></p><p>ex aliis signis cognosci potest, quid sit, et quales sint, et hoc nusquam fallit: sicut ubi stagnum est, ubi Gehenna, ubi spiritus immundi, qui in tonna, qui colon constituunt, ita in reliquis omnibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
