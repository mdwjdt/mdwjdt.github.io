<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2081</h4><p>2081. This spirit, who thought himself able to do everything, they trust exceedingly, because they trust in themselves and think themselves alone to be wise, looking down on others. This is clear from the fact that they think ill of all other people, setting themselves above all the rest, but doing so in their inward thought. They are therefore like pests in the societies of good spirits, and can be tolerated least of all in societies of angels, in which everyone ought to cherish a heartfelt wish for another's enjoyment and its abundant increase. And one ought to consider oneself as less than others, setting oneself as the least, consequently envying no one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2081</h4><p>2081. This spirit supposed himself adequate to all things; for they greatly confide in themselves, and think themselves alone to be wise, inasmuch as they despise others, as is apparent from their thinking ill of all others, thus preferring themselves to all others; but this inwardly or in thought, therefore they are, as it were, pests in the societies of good spirits, and can hardly be tolerated in the societies of the angels, in which everyone must from the heart or affection favor the enjoyment of another, and increase it manifold, and deem himself less than others, thus prefer himself less than others; consequently must not hate anyone. </p>

Spiritui huic, qui omnia posse se putabat, nam sibi, maxime <sup>1</sup></p><p>fidunt, et putant [se] solos esse qui sapiunt, nam alios despiciunt, quod patet ex eo, quod sinistre cogitant de omnibus aliis, ita se aliis omnibus praeponunt, sed intus seu in cogitatione, ideo sunt quasi pestes in societatibus bonorum spirituum; ac minime tolerari possunt in societatibus angelorum, in quibus unusquisque ex corde aut affectione favere debet alterius jucunditati, et eam multis augere; et se aliis minorem autumare, sic minime se aliis praeponere: proinde nec cuiquam invidere.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has sibi maxime </p>
