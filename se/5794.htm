<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5794</h4><p>5794. Christians live in outward appearance like another: they can become rich, but not through cunning or evil practices; they can eat and drink well, but not put their life in these things and not find enjoyment in excess, or drunkenness as well, this is enjoying self-indulgence; they can reside in comfort and, depending on their status, in magnificence; they can socialize with others as others do, entertain themselves with them, chat about things going on in the world, household matters; in a word, [they live] without any difference in outward matters, to such an extent that they do not appear to be any different. Nor they have need to appear devout, with a sad-looking face, head bowing, and sighing, but rather glad and cheerful; nor do they need to give their possessions to the poor, other than so far as an affection for the neighbor leads them to do so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5794</h4><p>5794. (A Christian lives as anyone else in external form: he may grow rich, but not by craft and trickery; he may eat and drink well, but not place his very life in those things, and find his delight in superfluities and also in drunkenness, that is, live for appetite; he may be well, and even, according to his condition, handsomely, housed; he may associate with others, like other men, amuse himself in their society; discuss the affairs of the world and the various things in domestic matters: in a word, without any difference in externals, to such an extent that no difference is apparent. Neither is it necessary that he should appear devout, so as [to go about] as it were with a sorrowful countenance, and with shaking head, and with sighing; but that he be cheerful and merry; nor [need he] give his goods to the poor, except so far as the affection of the neighbor prompts him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5794 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5794. Christianus vivit in externa forma sicut alius: potest ditescere, sed non cum astu et arte mala, potest bene edere et bibere, sed non in illis ponere ipsum vitam, et [non] delectari superfluis, et quoque ebrietate, hoc est vivere genio, potest bene habitare, et secundum conditionem suam magnifice; potest conversari cum aliis sicut alii, ludere cum illis, confabulari de rebus mundi, de variis in domesticis; verbo absque omni differentia in externis; usque ut non appareat discrimen; nec opus habet, ut devotus appareat, ut quasi tristi facie, et capite nutante, et gemens, sed ut laetus et hilaris; nec dare sua pauperibus, nisi quantum illum ducit affectio proximi: debet </p>
