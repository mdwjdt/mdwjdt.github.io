<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4953</h4><p>4953. About the Catholic religion and Babel<p>There are leaders and prelates who are from that religion and have persuaded themselves that the Lord gave the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter and consequently to them and that as a result they have the power of remitting sins and are in place of the Lord. They appeared on the right on each side of where the Lord is as the sun, into which place they were raised due to their belief that they are near the Lord and consequently have from Him the power of ruling over those who are below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4953</h4><p>4953. CONCERNING THE CATHOLIC RELIGION AND BABEL.<p>The bishops and prelates of that religion, who have persuaded themselves that the Lord gave to Peter, and consequently to them, the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and, thus, that [they have] the power of remitting sin, and therefore are in the place of the Lord - these appeared at the right hand, on each side of the place where the Lord appears as a sun; to which place they are elevated by virtue of the opinion that they are next to the Lord, and therefore [have], from Him, the power of ruling over those things which are below. </p>

De religione Catholica et Babel<p>Antistites et praelati qui ex illa religione sunt, et sibi persuaserunt quod Dominus dederit Petro et consequenter illis claves regni coelorum, et quod sic potestatem remittendi peccati, et sic quod loco Domini sint, illi apparuerunt ad dextrum utrinque a latere ubi Dominus ut sol, in quem locum elati sunt ex opinione illa quod proximi Domino sint, et ab Ipso sic potestatem dominandi super illa quae infra sunt [habeant]. </p>
