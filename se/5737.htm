<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5737</h4><p>5737. About the last judgment of the residue of the Catholic nation<p>There were many from the Christian world above my head who made a show to me that they had more light than others, and more heat as well. And I realized that, because they were there and a flaming evil brightness fell in front of my forehead from there, perhaps it was not well with them, and that the light was false and the heat unclean. I then discovered the source of the heat and light they had. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5737</h4><p>5737. THE LAST JUDGMENT OF THE RESIDUE OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNION. <p>Above the head were many from the Christian world, who showed me that they were in greater light, and also in greater heat than others; and, inasmuch as there was there, and fell down thence, before my face, a flaming evil light, it was perceived, that perhaps it was not well with them, and that the light was false and the heat unclean. It was then discovered whence their heat and light was. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5737 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5737. De ultimo judicio Catholicae gentis residuae<p>Erant supra caput plures ex Christiano orbe, qui ostendebant mihi, quod in lucido essent prae aliis, et quoque in calido, et percipiebatur quod quia ibi, et inde flammeum lucidum malum decideret ante frontem meam, quod forte non bene cum illis esset, et quod lux falsa, et calor spurcus esset; detectum tunc unde illis calor et lux. </p>
