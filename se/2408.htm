<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2408</h4><p>2408. There are some in the other life who play the part of others, not of themselves<p>There was a certain spirit with me who would think and speak only under the guise of someone else, constantly portraying others whom he happened to know, thus concealing his own identity. These spirits are easily discovered, and they are troublesome, bringing with them from the life of the body this practice of always presenting themselves as others who feel and speak as they do, in order to be convincing, and in the case of some, in order the better to set up their deceptions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2408</h4><p>2408. THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ONES IN THE OTHER LIFE, OF SUCH A CHARACTER THAT THEY ACT IN THE PERSONS OF OTHERS, [AND] NOT IN THEIR OWN. <p>There was a certain one with me, who did not think and speak, save under the persons of others [sub aliis], to wit, he continually represented others whom he had happened to know; consequently concealed his own person. Such persons are easily discerned, and are troublesome, and derive it from the life of the body, that they always prefer others that feel and speak thus, in order that they may persuade. Then also some [do so] in order that they may thus the better contrive treachery. </p>

Quod quidam tales sint in altera vita, quod sub aliorum personis, non sub sua, agant<p>Fuit quidam, apud me, qui non nisi sub aliis cogitabat <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et loquebatur, nempe quod jugiter repraesentabat alios, quos nosse ei contigit, sic suam personam occultabat, tales facile discernuntur, et molesti sunt, idque a vita corporis trahunt, quod semper praeferant alios ita sentientes, et loquentes, ut persuadeant, tum quidam, ut sic melius dolos nectant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has cogitatabat </p>
