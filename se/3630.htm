<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3630</h4><p>3630. This also shows how curious spirits are, for many societies of spirits had sent mediums to me who asked most inquisitively what that heavenly flame symbolized, not being satisfied by the explanation that it meant what was just said. For there were at the time very many societies around me, so that I could see that I was in the company of very many who had observed that something flamy had fallen down to me. 1748, 21 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3630</h4><p>3630. How curious spirits are may also hence appear, for many societies of spirits sent subjects to me, and very solicitously inquired what was signified by that flaming celestial appearance. They were not content when informed that it signified what I have just said; for there was then a vast number of societies around me, so that I perceived myself in fellowship with a multitude who observed that something flaming of this kind had been conveyed to me. -l748, October 21. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3630 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3630. Quam curiosi sint spiritus inde quoque constare potuit, nam plures societates spirituum miserunt ad me subjecta, et maxime sollicite inquisiverunt, quid flammeum illud coeleste significaret, non contenti quod diceretur, quod esset illud, de quo mox prius, erant enim tunc perplures societates circum me, sic ut me tunc perciperem in consortio perplurium, qui perceperunt quod flammeum tale ad me allapsum. 1748, 21 Oct. </p>
