<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3231</h4><p>3231. The Lord does good to His enemies<p>I was overcome with sleep after the noon hour, and quite a sound sleep. When I awoke there were many around me asleep, even spirits who had wanted to entrap me were sleeping deeply, thus all those who came with the intention of harming me. When they awoke, they said they had slept; and one after the other fled away, one saying that he had not meant to fall asleep; I sensed that he had wanted to do harm. Consequently I spoke with the spirits, saying that the Lord alone watches over all, even His enemies, and does good to them. 1748, 21 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3231</h4><p>3231. THAT THE LORD DOES GOOD TO [HIS] ENEMIES. <p>I was overcome with sleep [somno eram soportus] in the afternoon, and with quite a sound [sleep]. When I awoke there were many around me asleep, [in somno] even spirits who wished to lay snares for me: these also overcome [gravita] with sleep were fast asleep [dormiebant]: so with all who came up with the purpose to injure me. When they awoke, they said that they have been asleep, and fled away one after another: one said that he had not wished to sleep; it was perceived that he wished to injure [me]. Hence I spoke with spirits [saying] that the Lord alone watches over all, even [his] enemies, and does them good. - 1748, September 21. </p>

Quod Dominus benefaciat inimicis<p>Somno eram soporatus post meridiem, et satis gravi, cum evigilatus plures circum me in somno erant, etiam spiritus qui insidiari mihi voluerunt, ii quoque somno gravati dormiebant, ita omnes ii qui adveniebant, mihi <sup>1</sup></p><p>nocendi animo; cum evigilati dixerunt quod dormiverint, et aufugiebat unus post alterum, unus dicens quod non voluisset dormire <sup>2</sup></p><p>, perceptum quod nocere voluerit; inde loquutus cum spiritibus, quod Dominus vigilet solus super omnibus etiam inimicis et iis benefaciat. 1748, 21 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has mih<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has dormivisse </p>
