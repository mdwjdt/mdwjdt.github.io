<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3659</h4><p>3659. Then David, trying to be god, betook himself among inward spirits in front and toward the right, and subdued them, being convinced that he was god and could subdue anyone at all by his cruelty, as he did during his life. So he subjugated those inward spirits who were unwilling to acknowledge him, partly by his whirling method, and also by casting them into the vat, and other tricks discussed earlier.</p><p>[2] This he did quickly, for the mental image of inward persuasion brings this with it that it be done quickly, and inward spirits are in fact of that character. So he subdued many in short order, enticing others by other methods - namely, by the persuasion of adultery, perhaps breathing into them the enjoyments that he derives from it. So he subjected all the evil inward spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3659</h4><p>3659. After this David, because he wished to be a god, conveyed himself among the interior spirits in front towards the right, and subjected them, because [he was] in the persuasion that he was a god, and could subject everyone from the cruelty in which he was during his life; wherefore he subjected those interior spirits who refused to acknowledge him for a god, which he did partly by his boring [or whirling] operations, and partly by casting them into the [infernal] tun, and by other as described above, and this very quickly, for the idea of interior persuasion involves this, that everything is done quickly, and such is the quality of interior spirits; wherefore many of them he quickly subjected, others he inveigled by other modes, as, for instance, by the persuasion of adultery, perhaps by inspiring them with his own delights thence. Thus he subjected all the interior evil spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3659 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3659. David dein quia voluit deus esse, inter interiores spiritus antrorsus versus dextrum se contulit, et eos subjugavit, quia in persuasione quod deus, et quod unumquemvis subjugare posset crudelitate, qualis in vita quoque fuit, quare spiritus interiores istos subjugavit, qui eum pro deo non volebant agnoscere, partim suis terebris, tum quod in tonnam projiceret, et artibus de quibus prius, et hoc cito, nam persuasionis interioris idea hoc secum habet, ut fiat cito, et spiritus interiores quoque tales sunt, quare plures cito subjugavit, alios pellexit aliis modis, nempe persuasione adulterii, forte inspirando iis jucunditates suas inde, ita omnes spiritus interiores malos subjugavit. </p>
