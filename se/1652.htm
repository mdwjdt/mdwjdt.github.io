<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1652</h4><p>1652. Afterwards they spoke in such a way that I would understand nothing, and yet that the angels would understood even better than I, for it was like a very rare aura, that I could distinctly feel, but what they said was too rarefied for me to make out what they were saying. So they speak with the people of their planet who are almost angels. I remember having heard this kind of speaking somewhere else, but I was unable to tell what was said. Some who were with me said they understood it very well. This language is therefore still more inward. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1652</h4><p>1652. They afterwards spoke in such a manner that I understood nothing, while the angels understood it far better than I [could possibly have done], for it was by means of a most delicate aura, which I plainly perceived, although what was said was of too great tenuity for me to comprehend. They speak thus with the men of their earth who are almost angels. I remember to have heard elsewhere a similar speech, but what was said I could not learn, although some that were with me said that they could understand it well; this is therefore a speech still more interior. </p>

Postea loquebantur ita, ut nihil intelligerem, sed usque quod angeli adhuc melius intelligerent <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quam ego, nam sicut aura erat tenuissima, quam percipiebam manifeste, sed quid dicerent, erat tenuius quam ut scirem, quid loquerentur, ita loquuntur cum hominibus suae telluris, qui angeli fere sunt; talem loquelam etiam alias memini me audivisse, sed quid diceretur, non potui scire; quidam penes me dicebant, quod bene intelligerent; ita est haec loquela adhuc interior.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
