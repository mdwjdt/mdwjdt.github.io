<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3559</h4><p>3559. About a homicidal poisoner being cast into the swamp<p>Those with him complained that he was continually wrangling with the tenets of faith, and he was toward the front, a little bit coiled for about half of his length, and then unrolled a long way toward the filthy Jerusalem. He appeared to me on the roof of the city, but was said to be cast down into the miry swamp, from where he declared that it was full of dung and filth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3559</h4><p>3559. CONCERNING A HOMICIDAL POISONER, THAT HE WAS CAST INTO A LAKE.<p>Those that were with him complained that he continually fought against the things which are of faith. He was in front, and slightly or about half enveloped as to his face; and being rolled onwards for a long distance towards the filthy Jerusalem, he appeared to me over the roof of the city, but was cast down into a airy lake, from whence he said that it was excrementitious and foul. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3559 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3559. De venefico homicida quod conjectus in stagnum<p>Conquesti sunt, qui cum eo, quod continue oppugnaret ea quae fidei, et erat antrorsum, et ibi parum vel dimidia serie involutus, et sic revolutus longa distantia versus Hierosolymam spurcam, mihi apparebat super tectum urbis, sed dictum in stagnum coenosum, unde loquutus, quod excrementitium et sordidum esset. </p>
