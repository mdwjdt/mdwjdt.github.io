<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2423</h4><p>2423. The Lord controls the universe from the inward parts one after the other<p>By a clear spiritual mental image I was shown that the Lord rules everyone, thus the universe, from the inward regions one after the other. When I was engrossed in this mental picture, one and all appeared like the crudest little vessels having no life at all, thus no powers, but that all things are arranged inwardly by the Lord. When I was absorbed in the portrayal given of this mental image, the spirits around me being also absorbed in a similar one, then they admitted they are absolutely nothing, of themselves dead, only having life from the Lord and being carried wherever it pleases the Lord. For now they clearly saw themselves to be such, when yet in their outer state of mind they are by admission so gross as to think that they can do all things. 1748, 28 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2423</h4><p>2423. THAT THE LORD RULES THE UNIVERSE FROM INTERIORS BY ORDER. <p>By a spiritual idea manifest to me, it was shown that the Lord rules all, consequently the universe, from interiors, by order. When I was in this idea, they all appeared as most rude vessels, wherein there was no life at all, hence no power [virium], but that all things are disposed inwardly by the Lord. When I was in a given representation of this idea, there were also spirits around me in a similar [idea]; they then confessed that they are wholly nothing, dead of themselves, and [their] life only from the Lord, and that they are carried [ferantur] wheresoever it pleases the Lord: for they then plainly saw themselves [to be] such, when yet they suppose [it is permitted they are so gross] in their external state, that they can [do] all things. - 1748, June 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2423 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2423. Quod Dominus ordine ab interioribus regat universum<p>Per ideam spiritualem manifestam mihi ostensum est, quod Dominus regat omnes, ita universum, ab interioribus ordine, in qua idea cum essem, apparebant omnes, sicut rudissima vascula, quibus nihil prorsus vitae, proinde nihil virium esset, sed quod omnia intus a Domino disponantur, in ideae hujus repraesentatione data cum essem, etiam spiritus circum me in simili erant, tunc confessi quod prorsus nihil sint, ex se mortui, et solum vita a Domino, quodque ferantur, quacunque Domino beneplaceat, nam tunc manifeste se videbant tales, cum tamen, licet {a} tam crassi, putent in statu suo externo, quod omnia possint. 1748, 28 Junius. </p>
