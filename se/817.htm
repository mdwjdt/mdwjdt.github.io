<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 817</h4><p>817. An appetite for eating can also be brought upon spirits<p>That spirits have desire, and induce their desire on people, I have observed clearly and frequently [cf. 597, 741], so that they desire things which are entirely unnecessary to them, such as articles of human clothing. Indeed, they burn with an uncontrollable passion for them, even while they know that such things are not for them, but for the person [they are with], as for myself for example. I spoke about this matter with a spirit, and he knew and confirmed the fact, but did not rest until I had bought a certain sort of clothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 817</h4><p>817. THE APPETITE OF EATING CAN ALSO BE INDUCED BY SPIRITS <p>That spirits have cupidity, and induce their cupidity upon man, has been manifestly and frequently observed. Thus they desire things that are not at all necessary to them, such as those which pertain to man's clothing; and they even burn with such ardour that it cannot be moderated, although they know that such things are not for them, but for man, as myself. I spoke with a spirit about this matter, and he knew and confirmed it, but he did not rest until I bought a certain kind of garment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 817 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>817. Appetitus edendi induci quoque potest spiritibus<p>Quod spiritus cupiant, ac suam cupiditatem inducant homini, manifeste et saepius observatum est, sic ut cupiant ea, quae iis prorsus non necessaria sunt, prout ea quae ad vestitum hominis pertinent, et quidem tali ardore flagrant, ut temperari nequeat, quamvis sciant, quod pro iis non sint sed pro homine, sicut pro me, de qua re cum spiritu <sup>1</sup></p><p>locutus et novit et confirmavit, sed non prius quievit, quam dum vestimenti talem sortem emerim.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has spiritus </p>
