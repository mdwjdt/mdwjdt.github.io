<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3841</h4><p>3841. Next I was shown by some conversation with them and with others, that they were the ones overhead, the deceitful ones among the more deceitful, who imagine themselves to be the holy spirit, who having found him as a medium, were acting upon him, wanting to show through him that they were the holy spirit. Hence it may be known what kind of spirits they are in the other life, who pass themselves off as the holy spirit. 1748, 3 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3841</h4><p>3841. It was afterwards shown by a certain kind of speech with them and others, that they were those above the head - the deceitful among the more deceitful - who think themselves to be the Holy Spirit and who, having obtained this one as a subject, actuated him and wished by him to make it appear that they were the Holy Spirit. Hence the quality of those who, in the other life, vaunt themselves of being the Holy Spirit, may be known. - 1748, November 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3841 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3841. Ostensum mihi dein, per quandam eum iis et aliis loquelam, quod ii essent qui supra caput, dolosi inter dolosiores, qui spiritus sanctus esse se putant; qui eum, ut subjectum, nacti, agebant, et per eum sistere vellent, quod ii spiritus sanctus essent; inde quales sunt in altera vita, qui se pro spiritu sancto venditant, sciri potest. 1748, 3 Nov. </p>
