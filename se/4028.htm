<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4028</h4><p>4028. I was informed that these are the abodes of those who constitute the inner nostrils, or the tunic of the inner nostrils, which have holes of this kind. I spoke with them, and they said that by means of those holes that they made, they were able to see whatever was below in the direction they were aimed, and because it was toward me, by means of them could see all of my mental imagery, including all that I had while sleeping, and now and then of that which was round about me. This I was unable to believe, but they said that it was so, that they see the mental imagery portrayed before them - such as something related to love by the appropriate flames, matters of understanding by appropriate lights, and so forth - and indeed by means of those holes that they induce on themselves by fantasy, and certain female spirits are able to look at. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4028</h4><p>4028. I was informed that these were the dwelling-places of those who constitute the internal nostrils, or the tunic of the internal nostrils, which are distinguished by such orifices. I spoke with them and they said that through these openings made by them they could see in any direction below, and therefore could look towards me, and by means of them could see my ideas and those also which I had in my sleep, and generally whatever there was around me. This I found it difficult to believe, but they said it was so; that they saw ideas represented before them, as for instance, ideas of love by flames suited to the nature of that principle; intellectuals by lights suited to them, and so on. Indeed they said that through these openings they could see whatever they saw fit by phantasy to array before themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4028 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4028. Dicebatur mihi, quod ibi essent domicilia eorum, qui constituunt nares internas, seu tunicam narium internarum, quarum talia sunt foramina, loquebar cum iis, dicebant, quod per foramina ista ab iis facta possent videre, quicquid infra est, ibi quo diriguntur, et quia versus me, quod per ea videre possent omnes meas ideas, tum eas quas haberem, cum dormirem, et passim earum quae circum me; quod non credere potui, sed dicebant quod ita se habeat, quod ideas videant sibi repraesentatas, sicut dum amoris quid per flammas ei convenientes, intellectualia per luces convenientes, et sic porro; et quidem per foramina ista, quae sibi phantasia inducunt, et quaedam spectare possunt. </p>
