<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1768</h4><p>1768. I noticed that they instantly caught sight of anything that could be perverted. Their eyes were extremely observant, and they at once grasp and seize at the first glance whatever is in their favor, so as to distort it, or take credit for it, or make use of it, and they did this before I could tell at all that they had observed anything in me. Thus they are sharper than others, being immersed in the life of the loves of self. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1768</h4><p>1768. I observed that they perceive as in an instant what is capable of being perverted. They have their eyes intently fixed, and instantly lay hold of, or violently seize at the first glance those things which favor them either that they may pervert or vindicate, or assume as means; and that, too, before I could have the least idea that they had noticed anything pertaining to me; thus they are more acute than others, and are in the life of their self-love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1768 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1768. Observavi, quod ii quasi in instanti percipiant, quid pervertendum; intentissimos oculos habent, et illico ea capiunt seu rapiunt, ad primum nutum, quae sibi favent, ut vel pervertant, aut vindicent, aut assumant pro mediis, et quidem antequam potui minimum scire, quod observaverint quicquam penes me; ita sunt acutiores reliquis, inque vita amorum sui. </p>
