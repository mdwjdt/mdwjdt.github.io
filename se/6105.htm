<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6105</h4><p>6105. [numbered by Tr.] Charity toward the neighbor<p>Charity toward the neighbor is specifically carrying out one's function, business, and work faithfully, honestly, and justly, the person's role in society. The reason is that this is their daily business, their life's essential activity and pleasure. On this account, when people do this honestly and justly, their lives becomes a particular kind of charity in its own place and on its own level. It can be compared to the kernel of a nut: from this as the essential the rest then proceed, which are called its signs, kindnesses and duties, and they draw their own essence [from it], for they flow from its life which is charity. But without this essence, if it has signs that are acts of piety and the like, if it has good deeds which are giving to the poor and the like, and if it has duties which are its duties that regard such matters as are in their home and outside their home, then these are all like a shell without the kernel. It is different when it has a kernel and the essence from which [they are produced].</p><p>[2] Besides this, he does good to the community and to the individuals on his own level in the community. As a result, from the community the joy of life flows into him and every necessity as well. This happens in heaven and in the societies there. He is part of the common body. From this, doing his work honestly and justly, he becomes a worthy part in the common body, because everyone in a society must engage in some work. Works create a common body and cause all things to be held in connection; for works contain in themselves everything making up the person [doing them]. On this account, they must be engaged in works in hell as well.<p>There are for example Kings, Magistrates, priests, judges, businessmen, and farm workers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6105</h4><p>6105. CHARITY TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOR. <p>Charity towards the neighbor, in a specific sense, is to perform the employment, business, and work, which belong to one's calling, faithfully, sincerely and justly. The reason is, because this is a man's daily occupation, the very activity and delight of his life. When, therefore, a man performs this sincerely and justly, his life becomes such, thus becomes a certain charity, in its place and degree. This may be compared to a germ: then, from this as the essential, the rest, which are called the signs, benevolences and obligations of charity, proceed and derive their essence; for they flow from his life, which [in this case] is charity; and, without that essence, even though he have the signs of charity, which are acts of piety and the like, though he have its benevolences, which are giving to the poor, and similar things, though he have its obligations, which are such things as are his duties at home and outside his home, then, all these are like a shell without a kernel. It is different when he has the germ and essence already described. Moreover, such a one does good to the community, and does good to the individuals in the community in their degree. Hence, from the community there flows to him delight of life and every necessary. This obtains in heaven, and in the societies there. For everyone is a part in the common body. From performing his work sincerely and justly, he becomes a worthy part in the common body. For everyone in a society must be in some work. Works produce the communion, and cause all things to be held in connection; for works contain in them all things human. Wherefore, even in hell they must be in works. <p>Take, for example, kings, magistrates, priests, judges, tradesmen, artisans, farmers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6105 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6105 [.] Charitas erga proximum<p>Charitas erga proximum in specie est, fideliter, sincere et juste agere functionem, negotium et operam, quae suae functionis est, causa est, quia hoc ejus quotidianum est, ipsum vitae activum, et jucundum, quare homo cum sincere et juste id agit, fit talis ejus vita, ita fit quaedam charitas, in suo loco et in suo gradu: hoc comparari potest nucleo, tunc ex hoc ut essentiali procedunt reliqua quae vocantur charitatis signa, beneficia, et debita, et trahunt suam essentiam, fluunt enim ex vita ejus quae est charitas: at absque illa essentia, si ei signa sunt quae sunt pia et similia, si ei beneficia quae sunt dare pauperibus et similia, si ei debita quae sunt talia quae in domo et extra domum suam ejus debita sunt, tunc haec omnia sunt sicut crusta absque nucleo, aliter cum ei nucleus et essentia est de qua.<p>[2] Praeterea facit ille bonum communi, et singulis in communi bonum in suo gradu, inde ex communi fluit ad illum jucundum vitae, et omne necessarium, hoc in coelo et in societatibus ibi. Est enim pars in communi corpore, ex eo quod faciat opus suum sincere et juste, fit pars digna in communi corpore; nam quisque in societate erit in aliquo opere, opera faciunt communionem, et faciunt ut omnia teneantur in nexu; nam opera in se continent omnia hominis. Quare etiam in inferno erunt in operibus.<p>Sint exemplo Reges, Magistratus, sacerdotes, judices, negotiatores, operarii, coloni. </p>
