<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3557</h4><p>3557. Distance in the other life is a fallacy of the sense<p>At times I have noticed, when a spirit believed he was far away, and even speaking with others at a distance, that he is all at once close by me, so that he said he did not know how it works that while speaking with another at a distance, he is all at once present, and in fact, in his proper place, and continues to think where he had left off. 1748, 13 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3557</h4><p>3557. THAT DISTANCE IN THE OTHER LIFE IS A FALLACY OF SENSE.<p>It was sometimes observed that a spirit, when he believed himself to be absent, nay, when [he seemed] to speak with others at a distance, was at once close by me, so that he could not understand how the matter was, that while speaking with another at a distance, he should be immediately present, and his thought, which was intermitted, be continued. - 1748, October 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3557 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3557. Quod distantia in altera vita sit fallacia sensus<p>Observatum quandoque, cum spiritus crederet se abesse, imo loqui cum aliis ad distantiam, illico sit prope me, sic ut dixerit, quod nesciat quomodo id se habeat, quod dum loquitur cum alio ad distantiam, illico adsit, et quidem in suo loco, et conitinuet, quod intermisit, cogitare. 1748, 13 Oct. 61 </p>
