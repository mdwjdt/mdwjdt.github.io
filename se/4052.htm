<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4052</h4><p>4052. Those, however, who have the life of conviction or confirmation that faith saves, but nevertheless live a devout and compassionate life, from a conscience based on the fact that the Lord has so commanded, and do not take credit for it, but leave that to the Lord, because He has commanded it, and said it - they in the other life are saved. I have seen the palace in which they dwell, or rather, a kind of luxuriant city, with magnificent buildings, and at one side a palace with an entryway with columns of a variegated brown color. It is beautiful, the columns placed in a circle - everything there, the buildings, the palace, and the forum, appeared large. Then the streets are extremely white, giving a snowy white appearance, symbolizing the life of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4052</h4><p>4052. But those who are in the life of persuasion or confirmation that faith [alone] is saving, and yet live mercifully from conscience, because the Lord has so commanded and place no merit in it, but ascribe all to the Lord who has thus commanded and spoken, -they are saved in the other life. Their palace where they dwell was seen by me, or rather a certain appearance of a splendid city, with magnificent buildings, and on the side one palace with an entrance of columns of variegated brown color. It was very beautiful, having the columns placed circularly. All the buildings seen there, as the palace, the forum, which appeared large, and also the streets, were exceedingly white, so as to appear like the whiteness of snow, which signifies the life of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4052 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4052. Qui autem in vita persuasionis seu confirmationis sunt, quod fides salvificat, et usque pie ac misericorditer vivunt, ex conscientia, quod ita mandatum sit a Domino, nec in eo meritum ponunt, sed relinquunt Domino, quia ita mandavit, et dixit, ii in altera vita salvantur; visum mihi eorum palatium ubi habitant, seu potius quaedam species urbis nitidae, ubi magnifica aedificia, et a latere unum palatium cum introitu, ubi columnae coloris brunei variegati, pulcher est, in rotundum positae columnae; omnia ibi tam aedificia, quam palatium, quam forum, quod visum erat magnum, tum plateae sunt niveae maxime, sic ut niveum appareat, quod significat vitam fidei. </p>
