<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3432</h4><p>3432. So his preacher or instructor was present, whom I had seen earlier. When he was with him, he was of the same opinion and conviction, still able to lead him to doing things, as well as able to convince him of anything whatsoever he pleased. Therefore he had convinced him that there is only life, not even allowing the expression "faith" or the expression "truth and good," because they pertain to faith. Whether he would allow "love" and the word for it, I doubt, because I perceive that he does not know what love is. Consequently he does not know what life is, because he does not allow the life of faith, and hardly the life of love.<p>I sensed his life therefore as being cold. But still, when he lived in the body, he did not seem to himself to have done evil, but rejected whatever he considered to be carnal and worldly, being in other respects a serious person, and shying away from playfulness and pleasure. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3432</h4><p>3432. It is consequently clear that his preacher or instructor, who appeared to me before, was present [to him by his influence]; for whenever he was with him, the spirit was in a similar opinion and persuasion, and he had the power of leading him to do [whatever he pleased], since he could persuade him into whatever he wished, [and] thus had persuaded him that life was all in all. He does not even admit the utterance of the term faith, nor that of truth and good, because they are of faith. Whether he admits love and its vocal term I doubt, for I perceive that he does not know what love is, consequently he does not know what life is, because he does not admit the life of faith, and scarcely the life of love. His life therefore is perceived as being cold; but yet while he lived in the body he did not seem to himself to have acted badly; he rejected whatever he deemed corporeal and worldly, and being of a serious turn, shunned everything sportive and pleasant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3432 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3432. Quare ejus praedicator seu instructor aderat, qui mihi prius visus, qui cum apud eum, ex simili opinione et persuasione erat, qui usque illum potuit adducere ad faciendum, tum illi potuit persuadere quicquid usquam voluit, ita persuaserat ei quod vita solum sit, admittit ne quidem vocem fidei, nec vocem veri et boni, quia sunt fidei, num amorem admittat et ejus vocem, dubito, quia percipio, quod non sciat quid amor; proinde non novit quid vita, quia non admittit vitam fidei, et vix vitam amoris; percepta itaque vita illius, quod nempe esset frigida; sed usque ille dum vixit in corpore, non malum egisse sibi visus, quicquid corporeum et mundanum putabat esse, rejecit, alioquin serius, quod lusile et jucundum, quoque recusans. </p>
