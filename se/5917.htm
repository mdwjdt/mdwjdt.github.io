<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5917</h4><p>5917. There are two states of a person, especially of a learned person<p>The people who teach and the people who argue about Divine truths have two states: one when they are teaching and thinking from doctrine, another when they are thinking for themselves outside of doctrine. When they are in the prior state, they are not in a state coming from themselves because they are merely thinking from doctrine, and when in this state they do not think otherwise than that the things they are saying are true; in this state what they are saying is drawn from their memory.<p>But when they are in the second stage, they are then thinking for themselves and think from their own will, or love, thus from their own life, and in this stage none of their thought is taken from doctrinal teachings. This state is the spirit itself of a person, because it arises from the will, that is to say, from the person's love, thus his thought stems from his life. The prior state is not his own, because it is outside the will, which constitutes the life itself. For this reason, after death people continue to have the nature of their second state, because this state is the state of their life; the prior state is not their own state because it is a state of thought coming simply from the memory. In the latter state the earlier state is dormant; however in itself the first state is inflamed, so to speak, by the love of renown. There are many examples of the fact that the thinking of those who are in their own state think in opposition to what is Divine and in opposition to everything regarding the Church; but in the first state, when they preach, they think no other than that it is so, just as they have preached it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5917</h4><p>5917. THERE ARE TWO STATES OF MAN, ESPECIALLY OF A LEARNED MAN. <p>With men who teach and who reason about Divine truths, there are two states; one when they are teaching and thinking from doctrine, the other when they think in themselves apart from doctrine. While they are in the former state, they are [not] then in a state from themselves, because only in thought from doctrine; and, as long as they are in this state, they know nothing else than that the things they are saying are true: at such times, they take the things they say from the memory. But, when they are in the second state, they are then in themselves; and they think from their will, or love, consequently from their life; and then they do not think anything from their doctrinal. This state is the proper one of a man's spirit, because he thinks from his will, or from his love, therefore from his life: the former state is not his proper one, because it is apart from the will, which constitutes the very life. After death, therefore, a man remains such as was his second state, because that state is the state of his life; but the former is not the proper state of the man, because this state is merely a state of thought from the memory. In the latter state, the former state is laid asleep; and, in that state, he is urged to speak as he then does by the love of fame. Many examples may be given of those, who, in their proper state, have thought against the Divine and against all things of the Church, but, in the former state, while they were preaching, have thought nothing else than that the truth really is as they [then] declared. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5917 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5917. Quod bini status hominis imprimis hominis docti sint<p>Hominibus qui docent, et qui ratiocinantur de veris Divinis, bini status sunt, unus cum docent et cogitant ex doctrina, alter cum in se extra doctrinam cogitant, dum in priori statu sunt, tunc [non] sunt in statu ex se, quia solum in cogitatione ex doctrina, et cum in eo statu sunt, non sciunt aliter quam quod vera sint quae loquuntur, desumunt tunc illa quae loquuntur ex memoria; at cum [in] altero statu sunt, tunc in se sunt, et cogitant ex sua voluntate seu amore, ita ex sua vita, et tunc non aliquid cogitant ex doctrinali, hic status est proprius spiritus hominis, quia ex sua voluntate seu ex suo amore, proinde ex sua vita cogitat, prior status non est proprius ejus, quia extra voluntatem quae facit ipsam vitam; homo ideo post mortem manet, qualis ejus status alter, quia is status est status vitae ejus, at prior status non est proprius hominis, quia hic status est modo status cogitationis ex memoria; in hoc statu prior status est sopitus, et in eo statu accenditur ita loqui ex amore gloriae. Exempla plura dantur, quod qui in proprio statu cogitarunt contra Divinum, et contra omnia Ecclesiae, sed in priori statu, cum praedicarunt, nihil aliud cogitaverunt, quam quod ita sit, sicut praedicarunt. </p>
