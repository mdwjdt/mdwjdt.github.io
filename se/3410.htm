<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3410</h4><p>3410. Later I was shown what light he was in, for it was told that he was in light. It was a fiery light, but a dim one, as when darkness and fiery light are mixed together.<p>I was then instructed that there were many whose medium he was who are nocturnal fiery lights, thus surrounded by such light, being those who when they see in the other life how much spirits can do with their fantasies, then not only believe that the diabolical gang can do everything - and indeed by fantasies I believe I have discussed here and there elsewhere - and so persuade themselves, but also devote themselves to such practices and learn to operate by means of fantasies so as to be able to accomplish everything, imagining that in this way they can rule all things. So they devote themselves to these practices and wish to be of this character, imagining that the universe is subject to them and their fantasies. It was also demonstrated to me that they are of this character and think themselves lords of the universe. They are nocturnal lights - indeed, rather wax lights, because in them there is more sulphur than in tallow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3410</h4><p>3410. It was afterwards shown me, in what light he was, -it was said, that he was in a light [lumine]. There was in the light a fiery [principle] but obscure, as when darkness and the light of a fire are mingled. I was then instructed that there were many of such a character whose subject he was, who are nocturnal igneous lights, thus are surrounded with such a light, and these are they who when they see in the other life that spirits can accomplish so much with their phantasies, then not only believe that the diabolic crew can accomplish everything, yea by phantasies, which, I think, [I have treated] of here and there, in other places, and so persuade themselves, [but] also addict themselves to such things, and learn to act by phantasies so that they may be able to effect all things: they thus suppose that they are able to direct all things; thus addict themselves thereto and wish to be of such a sort: thus suppose that the universe is subject to them or their phantasies. It was also shown me, that this is their character, and thus they suppose they are rulers [lords] of the universe. They are nocturnal lights, yea, waxen lights, rather, because there is in them more of sulfur than tallow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3410 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3410. Postea ostensum mihi est, in quo lumine esset, dicebatur [enim] quod in lumine esset, erat lumen <sup>1</sup></p><p>igneum, sed obscurum, sicut cum tenebrae et lumen igneum commiscentur <sup>2</sup></p><p>; instruebar tunc, quod plures tales essent, quorum is esset subjectum, qui sunt lumina nocturna ignea, ita circumfusi tali lumine; et sunt ii, qui dum vident in altera vita, quod tantum facere possint spiritus phantasiis suis, tunc non solum credant omnia posse turbam diabolicam, et quidem phantasiis, de quibus ut reor alibi passim, et sic persuadent sibi, [sed] etiam se talibus addicunt, et discunt per phantasias agere, ut possint omnia, putantes sic quod omnia queant regere, ita iis se addicant, et volunt tales esse, sic universum sibi seu suis phantasiis subjectum esse putantes, quod etiam mihi ostensum quod tales sint, et sic putant se dominos universi; ii sunt lumina nocturna, et quidem lumina potius cerea, quia in iis sulphuris plus, quam sebacea.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has lumine<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
