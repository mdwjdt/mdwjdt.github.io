<p>222.三种太阳大气在属世心智，而非内在心智中运作；但在内在心智和至内在心智中，弥赛亚神是太阳。太阳所发出的属世大气有四种。产生听觉的大气是众所周知的。通过所有物体的奇妙反射产生视觉或可见形像的，是从空气中分离出来的更纯粹的大气。目前尚不十分清楚这种大气渗入属世心智到何种程度，或它是呈现出所谓的物质观念，还是呈现出幻想和想象；但从许多考虑来看，这似乎是极有可能的。那么，这将是在属世心智中占据主导地位的第一种大气。另一种大气比以太还要纯粹，它产生磁力，不仅尤其在磁铁周围占据主导地位，还在整个地球周围占据主导地位。但没有必要描述这些力达到多远。这种大气照着世界的两极产生整个水陆球体的结构，以及关于世人所知的有关磁性增强和倾斜度的许多现象。在属世心智中，这种大气似乎产生推理；这些推理也必包含属灵之物，以便它们能够存活，正如视觉和其它每种感觉为了能够感知而必须包含属灵之物一样。最纯粹的大气是全世界普通存在的那种，它在属世心智的推理中显现；因此，该心智被称为属世的。它的内在运作若败坏，就被称为推理；若符合次序，则被称为简单推理；简单推理是对属灵流注负责的思维的一种，或思维的外在方面。这些大气属于太阳，可称作太阳大气，因而属于自然界。然而，至于更内在的心智，它里面没有这种事物，也就是属于自然界的事物，而是有属灵之物；至内在心智里面则有属天之物；这两种事物唯独由弥赛亚神产生，是活的，因而被称为属灵和属天大气。今天早晨，一位天使和我一起讨论了这个主题；所以我深信不疑。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 222</h4><p>222. The 3 solar atmospheres operate in the earthly mind, not in the very inward mind; but God the Messiah in the very inward and the innermost mind is the Sun<p>There are four earthly fields emanating from the sun. The [aerial] atmosphere that makes hearing possible is well known.<p>A purer atmosphere separate from the aerial one is what produces seeing, or sights, by wonderful reflections of all objects. How far this atmosphere penetrates into the earthly mind, or whether it presents material ideas, as they are called, or fantasies and mental images, is not yet so clear - but it seems probable from many considerations. This, then, must be the first atmosphere that governs in the earthly mind. <sup>1</sup><p>A second atmosphere, still purer than the ether, <sup>2</sup>is the one that produces the powers of magnets, which govern not only in relation to the magnet in particular, but also to the earth as a whole. But how far-reaching these forces are, it is not our job to describe. This atmosphere produces the structure of the whole terraqueous globe according to the poles of the world, and many more phenomena concerned with magnetic elevations and inclinations known to the world. In the earthly mind, it seems to produce reasonings, which must also contain what is spiritual in order to be alive, just as the sight and any other sense must, in order to perceive.<p>The purest ethereal atmosphere is that universal one in the whole world, which manifests itself in the reasonings of the same mind, whence that mind is said to be earthly. Its inward workings when corrupt are called reasonings, and when in accordance with order, simply reason, which is the outward aspect of thinking, accountable to the spiritual influence.<p>These atmospheres pertain to the sun, and can be called solar atmospheres, and thus pertaining to nature.<p>As regards the very inward mind, however, in it there is no such thing, that is, what is of nature, but what is spiritual, and in the innermost mind, what is heavenly, both of which are produced by God the Messiah Alone, and are alive; and if realms are to be given names, these should be called spiritual and heavenly ones.<p>This morning an angel and I speaking together discussed this subject, and so I became convinced. 1747, the 27th day of October (old calendar).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. what is elsewhere called "ether."

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 222</h4><p>222. THAT THREE SOLAR ATMOSPHERES OPERATE IN THE NATURAL MIND, BUT NOT IN THE MORE INTERIOR MIND: BUT THAT GOD MESSIAH IS THE SUN IN THE MORE INTERIOR AND INMOST MIND <p>There are four natural spheres arising from the sun. The atmosphere which produces hearing is known; a purer atmosphere separate from the aerial is that which produces sight or visual images by the wonderful reflections of all objects. How far this atmosphere penetrates into the natural mind, and whether it also presents material ideas, as they are called, or phantasies and imaginations, cannot as yet be quite evident, but from many things it appears highly probable. This then will be the first atmosphere that reigns in the natural mind. Another atmosphere - the still purer ether - is that which produces the forces of magnets, which reign not only about the magnet in particular, but also about the whole globe, but there is no need to describe to what extent. It there produces the situation of the whole terraqueous globe according to the poles of the world, and many things known in the world about the magnetic elevations and inclinations. In the natural mind this atmosphere seems to produce reasonings, and with these there ought still to be what is spiritual in order that they may live, as there must be in the case of sight and of each of the senses in order that they may perceive. The purest ethereal sphere is the one that is universal in the whole world, which is presented around the reasonings of the same mind; hence that mind is called the natural mind, and its interior operations, when perverse, are called reasonings, but when according to order, simply reason, and it is a species of thoughts, owing to spiritual influx. These spheres are of the sun, and may be called solar, and thus natural. As regards the more interior mind, however, in it there is nothing of such a quality, that is, natural, but there is what is spiritual, and in the inmost mind, what is celestial; these things are produced by God Messiah alone and are living, and are thus to be called spiritual and celestial spheres. We conversed this morning concerning these things, an angel speaking with me, and so I was confirmed. 1747, Oct. 27, o.s. </p>
