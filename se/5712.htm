<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5712</h4><p>5712. After this I was brought to the London, spoken of above [5012-5014, 5016, 5092, 5360], and was guided there from the back part by smaller [streets] almost as far as the Borse, <sup>1</sup>and it was said that there they were not alive; and on the other side there too that they were not alive; in Cheapside some were; and on the side of the temple <sup>2</sup>likewise. I was not taken farther. From this it was evident that few there on that side are alive.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "the exchange"<br><br>2.&nbsp;I.e., St. Paul's. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5712</h4><p>5712. Afterwards, I was led through the London which is referred to above, <sup>1</sup>and was there conducted along the back part by the meaner [thoroughfares], almost as far as the Exchange; <sup>2</sup>and it was said that neither were those there living, nor, also, those at the other part. In Cheapside, some were; and also at the part by the temple. <sup>3</sup>I was not led any farther. Hence it was plain that few at that part, there, were living. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Nos. 5012-14, 5016, 5092, and 5360. -TR. <p>2.&nbsp;Swedish, Borse. <p>3.&nbsp;Probably St. Paul's Cathedral, - unless, indeed, the locality called "The Temple" be meant. --TR. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5712 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5712. Postea deductus sum Londinum, quod supra, et perductus sum ibi a parte posteriori a minoribus usque fere ad Borse, <sup>1</sup></p><p>et dicebatur quod ibi nec vivi, ab altera parte quoque nec ibi, in Cheapside aliqui, et quoque ab illa parte templi, ulterius non perductus; inde patuit quod pauci ibi viva ab illa parte.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;= the Exchange (vox suecica) </p>
