<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5417</h4><p>5417. Soon after this, the ever-shining lamp in their treasury was revealed. It was lifted up and displayed, and then carried about everywhere so that they might see it, wondering too then where such a trick came from. It was magical, that it shone constantly. And it was discovered that it originated in a certain mountain where there were monks who had discovered this trick, about whom an account follows soon. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5417</h4><p>5417. Shortly afterwards, the ever-burning lamp in their treasury was snatched away. It was lifted up and exhibited; and afterwards it was carried around everywhere, that they might see it; inquiry being then made whence such an art that it burned continually - which was magical - originated. It has found that it was in a certain mountain where some monks were who invented that art - some account of whom immediately follows. </p>
