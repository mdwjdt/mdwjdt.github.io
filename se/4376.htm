<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4376</h4><p>4376. Why the Lord was born on this earth<p>I realized that the Lord willed to be born on this earth, because this earth would have perished if He had not been born here, and because the human race on this earth answers mainly to bodily qualities, which could not be united with inward qualities in any other way than by the Lord's becoming human, and this after the interaction [of bodily and inward qualities] had begun to perish that existed as long as there was anything of the heavenly Church left, that is, of love to the Lord. 1749, 25 Aug. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Venus, meaning Friday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4376</h4><p>4376. WHY THE LORD WAS BORN ON THIS EARTH.<p>It was perceived that the Lord willed to be born on this earth, because, if he had not done so, the earth would have perished; and as the human race inhabiting our earth corresponds for the most part to corporeal things, they could not be otherwise united with interiors than by the Lord's becoming man; especially after the correspondence had begun to perish, which continued as long as there was anything of a celestial church, that is, of love to the Lord. - 1749, August 25. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4376 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4376. Cur Dominus natus in hac tellure<p>Perceptum quod Dominus in hac tellure voluit nasci, quia periret haec tellus nisi nasceretur, et quod humanum genus hujus telluris principaliter correspondeat corporeis, quae non uniri aliter interioribus possent, quam ut Dominus fieret homo; et hoc postquam correspondentia incepit perire, quae facta erat, quamdiu aliquid coelestis Ecclesiae fuit, hoc est amoris in Dominum. 1749, 25 Aug. </p>
