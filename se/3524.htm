<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3524</h4><p>3524. Spirits have an exquisite awareness of everything coming forth from societies<p>I remember it happening twice that while I was unaware of it, spirits brought into my mind and my facial expression by a kind of indignant feeling, those things they had seen, which did not become known to me except from that effect. From this I was given to learn that spirits sense most exquisitely the changes of feelings and convictions that occur, which I could not perceive except from the effect. They brought in a kind of indignation, or of shame, the cause of which I did not really know until a little later. Who the spirits were I do not know. I don't think they were speaking, but still they are present. 1748, 10 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3524</h4><p>3524. THAT SPIRITS HAVE AN EXQUISITE PERCEPTION THE THINGS THAT EXIST FROM SOCIETIES.<p>I recollect its twice happening, that, while not aware of it, certain spirits, by means of a kind of affection or indignation induced upon my mind and my face the things which they perceived, and which were no otherwise made known to me than by that effect. It was hence given to know that spirits have a very exquisite perception of the changes of affections and persuasions which occur, but which I could perceive only from the effect. Thus they inspired a species of indignation or of shame, the cause of which I did not understand till some time afterwards. What kind of spirits they were I know not, nor do I think they spoke; still they were present. - 1748, October 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3524 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3524. Quod spiritus exquisitam perceptionem habeant eorum quae existunt ex societatibus<p>Bis memini contigisse, quod dum non scirem, spiritus mihi per affectionis seu indignationis speciem intulerunt animo meo et faciei meae ea quae perceperunt, quae non nisi quam ab effectu isto mihi nota fiebant, inde scire datum, quod spiritus percipiant perquam exquisite mutationes affectionum et persuasionum quae existunt, quae ego non potui percipere, solum ab effectu, indignationis speciem, seu pudoris intulerunt, cujus causam non ita novi, nisi postmodum paulo; quinam spiritus fuissent non novi, non reor quod loquantur, sed usque adsunt. 1748, 10 Oct. </p>
