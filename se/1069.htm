<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1069</h4><p>1069. How it is to be understood that we can do nothing to better ourselves by our own power<p>A great many spirits, almost all, cannot understand the saying that they can accomplish nothing toward their own betterment. As a result, they think they should omit trying to will, and to act- which, of course, is false. Both man and spirit can always try, and exert will power, when not being given reflection by the Lord on the fact that they can do nothing by their own powers. When not so reflecting, they seem to themselves to be acting on their own, when yet it is from the Lord, Who also gives the ability to try. But when the reflection is given, then they should acknowledge that this effort also is given by the Lord. 1748, 28 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1069</h4><p>1069. HOW IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT MAN IS ABLE TO EFFECT NOTHING TO HIS AMELIORATION BY HIS OWN PROPER POWERS <p>Very many spirits - indeed almost all - cannot understand that they can effect nothing to their amelioration. They suppose that in that case they must give up all effort to will and act; this in itself is a false idea. Man, as also a spirit, can always endeavor and will by his own powers, when it is not given him by the Lord to reflect that by his own powers he can effect nothing. When there is no reflection he then seems to himself to act from himself, when nevertheless it is from the Lord Who also grants that he should endeavor to do this. But when reflection is given he ought to acknowledge that this also is a gift from the Lord. 1748, Feb. 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1069 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1069. Quomodo intelligendum, quod homo nihil propriis viribus ad sui meliorationem efficere valeat<p>1069. Spiritus perplures, et fere omnes non possunt intelligere, quod non possint hilum efficere ad sui meliorationem, quare etiam putant, quod omittere <sup>1</sup></p><p>debeant omnem conatum volendi, agendique, quod falsum in se est; homo ut spiritus semper potest suis viribus conari et velle, quando non ei reflexio datur a Domino, quod nihil efficere valeat suis viribus, cum nulla reflexio, tunc se agere sibi videtur ex semet, cum tamen id est ex Domino, Qui etiam dat ut id conetur, at cum reflexio datur, tunc agnoscere debet, quod hoc quoque datum sit a Domino. 1748, 28 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
