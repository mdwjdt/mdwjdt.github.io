<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2321</h4><p>2321. The Lord rules the universe<p>Since there are so many myriads of spirits in the world of spirits, each one of a different nature and character, like people on earth, it may seem amazing how they can all be reduced to one, or controlled, since there are societies after societies. Moreover, one spirit or a society as a unit is quite clearly aware of the energies of the rest of the societies, many of which pant for nothing else than to kill one another, and to destroy whatever savors of society, companionship, or a social bond. For they are stirred up by self-love and the consequent hatred against everyone else, especially against all matters of faith, thus of true love, and so, against the Lord.<p>Yet in this universal and individual disagreement, all and each individually are so ruled by the Lord that one cannot even open his mouth against the other, which also shows what order, what subordination, there is, and furthermore it does not appear to them that there is a restraint, but as if there is freedom. Spirits all imagine they are able to live according to their own fantasy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2321</h4><p>2321. THAT THE LORD RULES THE UNIVERSE. <p>Since there are so many myriads of spirits in the world of spirits, and everyone of them of a different nature and disposition, just like men, it may seem wonderful how all these can be reduced to a one, or be ruled, when there are continual societies; and moreover, a single person, or the society of a single one, perceives plainly enough the activities of the remaining societies, and many of them are such that they breathe nothing else than killing one another, and destroying whatever is styled [audit] society, social principle [sociale], and bonds [restraints] [vinculum] for they are moved by self-love, and thus by hatred against every other body, especially against all that belongs to faith, consequently that belongs to true love, therefore against the Lord. In so universal and singular a discord, still all and each are so ruled by the Lord, that not even one can hiss [hiscere] against another; hence it must also be evident of what quality is order and what the subordination; and moreover, it does not appear to them that there are [any] bonds, but as if they were free; every spirit supposes that he can act according to his own phantasy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2321 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2321. Quod Dominus regat universum <sup>1</sup></p><p>Cum tot myriades spirituum sint in mundo spirituum, et unusquisque eorum diversa natura et indole, sicut homines, mirum potest videri, quomodo ii omnes possunt redigi ad unum, seu regi, cum continuae sunt societates, et praeterea unus seu unius societas percipit satis manifeste activitates societatum reliquarum, et plurimae eorum tales sint, ut nihil aliud spirent, quam interimere unus <sup>2</sup></p><p>alterum, et destruere quicquid societas, sociale, et vinculum societatis audit, nam sui amore sunt perciti, et odio sic contra omnem alium, imprimis contra omnia ea, quae sunt fidei, proinde quae sunt veri amoris, ita contra Dominum; in tali universali et singulari discidio usque omnes et singuli <sup>3</sup></p><p>ita a Dommno reguntur, ut ne unus quidem hiscere possit contra alium, inde quoque constare potest, qualis ordo, et quae subordinatio, ac praeterea non apparet iis, quod sit vinculum, sed quasi quod sit liberum, putat unusquisque spiritus, quod agere possit secundum suam phantasiam.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript post titulum, manu B.
