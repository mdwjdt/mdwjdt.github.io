<p>507.龙的性质。如前所述（501-505节），龙具有这样的性质：他全神贯注于每一个和一切事物，以致他不会放过任何东西，无论内在的还是外在的；所以他有一双警觉的眼睛，他将自己与每一件事都混在一起，通过他所知道的各种方式用自己的能力掩盖痕迹，免得从他身上露出蛛丝马迹。他也通过否认如此行，除非他公然爆发愤怒。这时，他会亵渎，心怀仇恨，不放过任何人，除非这人是崇拜他的人之一。他寻求以各种方式保障他自己，以免被推翻。当被推翻时，他就不断追求更高的东西。此外，因着不断练习，他精通各种诡计，并施行了其中的许多种，包括一些极其污秽的东西，他曾用这些东西糟蹋自己。他也在愤怒中实施这些诡计；由于这么多年的习惯，也由于大量灵人一起吹入他里面，如同吹入他们自己的集中点，他凭自己不可能做别的任何事，他沦为他们的终极媒介。事实上，有许多人同样是龙，但他们视他为他们的偶像。这就是为何他具有这样的性质，因为他若失去崇拜他的人，将一事无成。这龙是犹太人在死后生活中的领袖和神，也是所有恶人的领袖和神，甚至在所谓的基督教徒中也是，他维护所有这些人。（1748年1月22日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 507</h4><p>507. The dragon's nature <sup>1</sup>It is the nature of the dragon, spoken of [<a href="501.htm">501-505</a>], take notice of all the least things, so that he does not let anything, either inward or outward, pass him by. Thus he keeps his eyes alert, mixing into every single thing then covers up the trails by every means he knows, including denials, so it will not appear that anything came from him - except when he breaks out in overt anger. Then he blasphemes, brings forth his inner hatred, spares no one who is not a worshipper of him, seeks fortify himself in every way so as not be overthrow When thrust down, he keeps on reaching for higher things he is also skilled through continual practice in every kind of subterfuge, exercising many of them, including some that are very filthy would involve him prostituting himself. These he also practices in anger, nor could it be otherwise, due a habit of so many years due the great number of spirits together breathing into him as their own focal point, of whom he is the ultimate medium. There are, in fact, many who are likewise dragons, but they relate him as their idol. This is why he has this nature, for if he were be deprived of worshippers, he would be capable of nothing. This is the chief the God of the Jews in the life after death, as well as of all those who are evil, even among Christians so-called, all of whom he champions. 1748, the 22nd day of January. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The manuscript has no paragraph 506. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 507</h4><p>507. <sup>1</sup>THE NATURE OF THE DRAGON <p>The dragon (concerning whom see above [nos. <a href="../se/501.htm">501-505</a>) is such that he is intent upon each and everything, so that he suffers nothing to pass by whether interior or exterior; thus he has watchful eyes, and he mixes himself up with each and all things, and by every means in his power blocks up the ways lest anything should appear to be from him. He also does this by denials, except when he breaks out into open anger, and then he blasphemes, bears internal hatred, and spares no one unless he be one of his adorers. He seeks to fortify himself in every way, lest he should be overthrown. When thrust down he strives continually after higher things. Moreover, from continued practice he is skilful in all the arts, and exercises many of them; there are also those which are quite foul, with which he has prostituted himself. He also exercises those arts in anger, nor can he do anything else of himself, or from the custom of so many years, and also from so many spirits who breathe together into him as into their own center, of whom he is the ultimate subject. There are indeed many who are likewise dragons, but these refer themselves to him as their idol; hence he is of such a nature, for if he were destitute of adorers, he would be capable of nothing. This dragon is the leader and god of the Jews in the life after death, as well also as of all the evil, even among the so-called Christians, all of whom he defends. 1748, Jan. 22. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is no n. 506 in the manuscript. </p>
