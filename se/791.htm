<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 791</h4><p>791. The odor of offences<p>I perceived a general feeling of spirits that was so made up of offences, <sup>1</sup>that they would not acknowledge the Lord as the Lord of the universe and Savior of all. This was the general feeling that I sensed, so I was comparing it with a certain odor. For everything of this kind is so comparable to an odor, that it is even presented by means of an odor; and whenever it so pleases [the Lord], it is indeed smelled as an odor, both by those on earth and by spirits.<p>Then I became aware of the kind of odor like that of stinking water, or water polluted with garbage; and I was told that this is the odor [of offences]. 1748, 15 February.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. offences against the faith, or stumbling blocks. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 791</h4><p>791. THE ODOR OF SCANDALS <p>I perceived the general sentiment of spirits to be so composed of scandals, that they would not acknowledge the Lord as the Lord of the universe and the Savior of all; this was the general sentiment which I perceived. I therefore compared it to a kind of odor, for anything like this can be compared to an odor, and it is also represented by an odor. As often as it is pleasing [to the Lord], it is also sensed as an odor, both by man and by spirits. That odor was then perceived; it was like that of stinking water, or of water defiled with refuse. I sensed this, and it was told me that such is the odor of those scandals. 1748, Feb. 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 791 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>791. Odor scandalorum<p>Percepi communem sensum spirituum, quod ex scandalis ita conflatus esset, ut non agnoscerent Dominum, ut Dominum universi, et Salvatorem omnium, qui sensus erat communis <sup>1</sup></p><p>, a me perceptus, ideo comparabam eum cum odore quodam, nam quodlibet simile, comparari potest cum odore, ut etiam per odorem quoque repraesentatur, et quoties placet <sup>2</sup></p><p>, etiam per odorem, tam ab homine quam a spiritibus sentitur, dein odor iste perceptus est, qui erat similis aquae putidae, seu ex quisquiliis conspurcatae, quem sentiebam, et dicebatur mihi, quod talis odor est. 1748, 15 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
