<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4053</h4><p>4053. Later, spirits spoke with me by means of portrayals alone, and, in fact, depicting those having a life of the conviction regarding faith, that it saves without works, as well as their quality. The portrayals of the spirits, which were now their speech, were numerous - such, for example, as the coals in the fireplace, the flame within, hardly visible, only as light; then a bottle of a brown color, vanishing - it was above the fireplace, with nothing in it - shining stones of lucid color; then a man sleeping, with a white cap, awakening, and two empty tubs.<p>Afterwards wine cellars appeared, where there were certain ones such as had been where the tubs were seen, and the light, who are in confusion there, as if from wine. Then various other things appeared, such as different kinds of little houses with pulpits of different styles; then black clouds that were trying to ascend by stairs into heaven, like devils; then those who were carrying a basket of wood chips, having something luminous above, which basket they were lifting upward - besides other things that were portrayals of spirits. Thus it was a language consisting of pure portrayals. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4053</h4><p>4053. Spirits afterwards spoke with me through mere representations, such as denoted those who are in the life of the persuasion that faith without works is saving, and of what quality they are. The representatives of spirits, which were then their speech, were many, as, for instance, of coals in a furnace, with a smothered flame emitting a little light; then an empty flask of a brown color, hardly visible, placed over the furnace; whitish stones of a somewhat bright hue; then a man with white locks awakened from a sleep, and two empty tuns. Afterwards wine cellars were seen where certain persons appeared such as are seen where the tun and the light were, and who there acted confusedly, as if from the effects of wine; then divers other things, as various little rooms with pulpits or desks differently fashioned; then black clouds which would fain arise by ladders to heaven, like devils; and finally, persons carrying a basket containing chips of wood, with a certain luminous something above, which basket they lifted upwards; besides various other things, which were the representations made by spirits, and thus a kind of speech effected through mere representations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4053 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4053. Postea loquuti spiritus mecum per solas repraesentationes, et quidem repraesentantes eos, qui in vita persuasionis fidei, quod salvet absque operibus, ut et quales sunt, repraesentationes spirituum, quae tunc erant eorum loquela, erant multae, sicut quod carbones in camino, et flamma intus, vix conspicua, modo lux; tum lagena brunei coloris, evanescens, super camino erat, nihil intus: lapides candentes, coloris lucidi, tum vir dormiens cum pileo albescente, evigilatus, et tonnae binae vacuae. Postea cella vinaria, ubi ibi quidam, tales, ubi visa tonna, et lumen, qui ibi confunduntur, sicut ex vino; dein diversa alia, sicut domunculae diversae, cum pulpitis variatis; tum nubes nigrae quae ascendere vellent per scalas in coelum, sicut diaboli; tum qui portabant corbem in quo ramenta lignea, cum luminoso quodam supra, quem corbem sursum elevabant, praeter alia, quae repraesentationes erant spirituum, sic loquela per meras repraesentationes. </p>
