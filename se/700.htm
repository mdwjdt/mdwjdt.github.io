<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 700</h4><p>700. When one society after the other had declared with a loud voice, as if in song, that the Wolf had stolen them away but that the Lord had snatched them back and restored them to Himself, this saying was passed along farther away from me, from one society to the other, or to one choir after another. Also, at some distance, it was uttered by those of one choir rather doubtingly, with falling voices. This choir, however, being brought back to the proper state, was taken in by the twelfth society; they said that this was the character of the twelfth. (There had actually been eleven, but still a twelfth was also admitted.) Afterwards about eight more societies came, declaring the same thing, whom I thought to be of the other sex, or of a different kind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 700</h4><p>700. When one society after another had said as if in unison and with a raised voice, that the wolf had wanted to carry them away, but the Lord had snatched them back and restored them to Himself, such sayings were continued from one society to another, or by one choir after another, thus further and further away from me even as to distance. By some it was said more doubtingly, thus with a fading away of the words, which fading was nevertheless restored to the full. They were concluded by the twelfth society: they said that there were twelve such societies. There were indeed eleven [admitted], but yet the twelfth was also admitted [but with greater difficulty than the others]. <sup>1</sup>Afterwards there again came about eight societies speaking in like manner, which I supposed were of the other sex, or of another genus. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See AC 2130. </p>
