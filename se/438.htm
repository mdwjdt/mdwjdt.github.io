<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>438.最末层的天使天堂：那里的天使们的幸福是由相似的尘世幸福构成的。那些因厌恶天上事物的不和谐仍在他们里面占主导地位而尚未被允许进入天堂的灵人，正与我谈论天堂的幸福。由于他们对它一无所知，所以有人说，那些能在一起和谐生活，形成社群的人就住在不同的居所。事实上，在那里，出于仍与他们同在的幻觉或想象的力量，天堂的愉悦和快乐场景似乎为他们而被造，天堂的平安在这些场景中掌权。如果他们想要，他们觉得乐园也能被造，并且这些乐园里有各种各样的树木和果实：还有城市、宫殿和类似的东西；不过，这些事物不可向世人过多地描述，免得他们在幻想中寻求天上的东西。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 438</h4><p>438. The last angelic heaven: their happiness is based in settings similar to earthly ones<p>Spirits who had not yet been let into Heaven because disharmony repugnant to heavenly beings still prevailed in them, were speaking with me about heavenly happiness. Because they did not know about it, <sup>1</sup>it was said:<p>There are separate dwellings, where those are who can live together harmoniously, forming societies. In fact, from a power of illusion or imagination still remaining with them, pleasant and delightful [scenes] seem to be created for them, in which heavenly peace reigns. If they so choose, pleasure gardens also seem to be created for them containing every variety of trees and fruits; as well as cities and palaces, and the like.<p>But these things should not be described too much for the world, lest it seek what is heavenly in fantasies.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;While the original has "ignorabam," the context clearly calls for "igorabant." By prolepsis, the author wrote "ignorabam, dicebam" and then changed "dicebam" to "dicebatur." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 438</h4><p>438. THE ULTIMATE ANGELIC HEAVEN: THAT THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE WHO ARE THERE CONSISTS OF SIMILAR NATURAL VARIETIES <p>Spirits who had not as yet been admitted into heaven because discord, which is repugnant to the heavenly ones, still dominated, spoke with me concerning heavenly happiness. Because I was ignorant about it, it was said that there are distinct abodes, where are those who can live conjoined, and they form societies; and there, indeed, from the phantasy or imagination still remaining, heavenly pleasantnesses and delights appear to them to be formed, in which heavenly peace reigns. If they also wish it for themselves, paradises also appear to them to be formed with every variety of trees and fruits: and also cities, palaces, and similar things; but these things are not to be written in this way for the world lest they seek heavenly things in phantasies. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 438 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>438. Ultimum (1) coelum angelicum quod ex varietatibus naturalibus similibus felicitas eorum consistat<p>Spiritus, qui nondum admissi in Coelum sunt, quia discordia, quae repugnat coelestibus, dominabatur adhuc, de coelesti felicitate mecum loquebantur, quam quia ignorabam, dicebatur, quod distincta sint domicilia, ubi ii qui conjuncte <sup>2</sup></p><p>vivere possunt, sint, et forment societates, et quidem ibi ex remanente adhuc phantasia seu imaginatione, sibi videantur formari amaenitates et delitiae coelestes <sup>3</sup></p><p>, in quibus pax coelestis regnat; si etiam optant sibi, etiam sibi videntur formari paradisi, cum omni varietate arborum et fructuum, tum etiam civitates et palatia, ac similia, sed haec non ita scribenda sunt orbi, ne in phantasiis quaerat coelestia.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition conjuncti </p>
