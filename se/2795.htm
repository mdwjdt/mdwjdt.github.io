<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2795</h4><p>2795. How truths look to those immersed in falsity<p>I was inspired to say that to those immersed in falsity, truths look like falsities when they are convinced that their falsity is a truth. This was shown instantaneously by actual experience, and in fact by a general mental image of truths, which appeared to one who had a false idea that he thought to be true, as mere falsities. And besides, I was shown by a spiritual mental image that truths cannot possibly enter into the aura of such people, but are either considered as mere falsities, or as mere theories. 1748, 11 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2795</h4><p>2795. OF WHAT NATURE DO TRUTHS APPEAR THOSE WHO ARE IN FALSITY. <p>It was granted me to say that to those who are in falsities truths appear [to be] falsities, when persuaded that their falsity is the truth. This was immediately shown by living experience, and indeed by a general [communem] idea of truths, which general idea appeared like mere falsities to him who was in a false idea which he regarded [as] true. And it was moreover shown me by a spiritual idea that truths can by no means enter into the sphere of such: but are regarded partly as mere falsities or as mere hypotheses. - 1748, August 11. </p>

Quales veritates apparent iis, qui in falsitate sunt<p>Dicere dabatur mihi, quod veritates appareant iis qui in falsitate sunt, sicut falsitates, cum persuasi sunt quod falsitas eorum sit veritas, quod illico ostensum per vivam experientiam, et quidem per ideam communem veritatum, quae idea communis apparebat ei, qui in <sup>1</sup></p><p>falsa idea erat, quam veram putabat, sicut merae falsitates, et praeterea per ideam spiritualem mihi ostensum, quod veritates in sphaeram talium nequaquam intrare possunt; sed putantur partim ut merae falsitates, vel ut merae hypotheses. 1748, 11 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
