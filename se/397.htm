<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>397.白天的一个异象，是关于那些贪图大吃大喝，从而放纵肉体之人的。<p>中午，大约午餐时分，一位与我同在的天使告诫我说，不要在餐桌上放纵自己的肚腹。当他和我在一起时，我清楚地看到一种蒸汽从我身体的毛孔中渗出来，就像某种水状物，极其清晰；它似乎滑落地板，那里有一块地毯，蒸汽在地毯上集聚起来，变成各种各样的小虫子。这些小虫子聚集在桌子下面，顷刻之间就被烧尽，还发出噼噼啪啪的响声。我看见里面的火光，听见声音，判断因过度的食欲而生成的所有小虫子都从我身上被赶出去，因而被烧尽了；现在我已经洁除了它们。从这次经历可以推断，奢华的生活和类似事物里面都潜藏着什么。（1745年4月，这一经历虽发生在1745年，但在1747年被记录在此）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 397</h4><p>397. A vision by day, about those who are given to feasting, and thus devoted to the flesh<p>At midday, around lunch time, an angel who was with me cautioned me not to overindulge my stomach at table. While he was with me, a kind of vapor clearly appeared to me to be issuing from the pores of my body, having a visibly very watery quality. It seemed to sink down toward the floor, where there was a carpet on which the vapor, coming together, turned into different kinds of tiny worms. These, gathered together under the table, in an instant, and with a crackling sound, just burned up.<p>I saw the fiery flash, and heard the noise, and judged that all the little worms that can be generated by an immoderate appetite had thus been cast out of my body and burned up, and that I had now been cleansed of them. From this experience, one may infer what sumptuous living and the like, harbor within them. 1745, April. [see <a href="93.htm">93</a>a]. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See also R.L. Tafel, Documents, vol. II, pp. 35-36. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 397</h4><p>397. A VISION BY DAY CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE DEVOTED TO THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE, AND WHO THUS INDULGE THE FLESH <p>At mid-day, about dinner time, an angel who was with me spoke to me saying that I was not to indulge the belly too much at the table. While he was with me there then clearly appeared to me, as it were, a vapor exuding from the pores of my body like something watery, in the highest degree visible, which slipped down to the ground where a carpet was seen upon which the collected vapor was turned into various little worms, which being gathered together under the table, were burnt up in a moment, with a loud noise or sound: the fiery light therein was seen by me and the sound heard. I suppose that in this way all the little worms which can be generated by an immoderate appetite were cast out of my body, and thus were consumed, and that I was then cleansed from them. Hence it can be concluded what sumptuous fare and such like things carry in their bosom. 1745, April. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This experience, though occurring in 1745, was here recorded in 1747. There is an earlier description of apparently the same occurrence in WE 3557, written about April 1746 in connection with the plague of frogs in Egypt. The two descriptions are listed together in the Index, s.v. Edere and Vermis. There is another account in Apoc. 5, n. 15, Vol. I, p. 35. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 397 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>397. Visio diurna, de iis qui comessationibus dediti sunt, et sic carni indulgent<p>In media die circa prandium, mecum loquutus est angelus, qui mecum, quod non nimis indulgerem ventri circa mensam; dum penes me erat, tunc apparuit mihi clare sicut vapor exundans e poris corporis, sicut aqueus maxime visibilis, qui versus terram delapsus, ubi tapete <sup>1</sup></p><p>erat visus, super quem collectus vapor in vermiculos diversos vertebatur, qui collecti sub mensam, momento cum strepitu seu sonitu deflagrabant; lumen igneum visum est mihi, et sonitus auditus, [ego] arbitrans <sup>2</sup></p><p>quod sic omnes vermiculi e corpore meo ejecti, qui ex appetitu immodico possunt generari, combusti essent, et quod ego tunc ab iis mundatus fuerim. Inde concludi potest, quid lautitiae et similia in sinu ferunt. 1745, April.
