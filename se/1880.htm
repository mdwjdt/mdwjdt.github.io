<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1880</h4><p>1880. There appeared there, and it was indeed at Uppsala, a stage cast, consisting of brown-colored statues placed about in the manner of a theater, not unbecoming in appearance. While I was looking on, one or a couple of the statues, like skeletons of the same color, moved, and began to behave as though they were putting on a theatrical play. I wondered whether all the statues made like these were also mobile, and would now put on a play. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1880</h4><p>1880. There appeared as if at Upsal a theater formed consisting of statues of brown color, which were placed around in the fashion of a theater having a somewhat handsome appearance. While looking upon the scene, one or two of them, as if they had been brown colored skeletons, moved themselves, and made a beginning as if they would have instituted a theatrical play, and I wondered whether all the statues would be made thus movable and enter upon the play. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1880 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1880. Ibi apparuit theatrum formatum, et quidem Upsaliae, constans ex statuis coloris brunei, quae in theatri formam circumpositae, ad apparentiam non impulchram; cumque inspicerem, una seu binae earum, sicut sceleta, ejusdem coloris, se movebant, et initium faciebant, ut instituerent ludum theatralem, nam miratus anne omnes statuae ita factae essent mobiles, et sic ludum instituerent. </p>
