<p>437.一种通过表现出孩子般的诚实而进行的洁净。一种温和的洁净过程被应用于某些人身上，好把他们带回一种孩子般的诚实，他们是那种受到仁慈对待的人。但由于他们的幻觉，这种诚实里面也存在一种在理解力上胜过别人的强烈渴望。然而，他们的理解力被囚禁并受到约束，因为他们要么热爱自己的想法，几乎不能容忍别人说出比他们自己更真实、更好的想法，要么不想让自己的团体，因而自己的好名声被减损。他们也以这种方式出于自己胜过别人的想法行事。在这种诚实的诱导状态下，他们被隐藏的欲望如此折磨，以致他们热切地想要摆脱它，回到他们原先的状态。然而，对其他人来说，在这种孩子般的状态下，一个人可以是快乐的，因为这时他在忧虑不安的状态之外。（1747年12月31日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 437</h4><p>437. A kind of purging by bringing on a childlike uprightness<p>Now to some, a kind of gentle purging process is applied that brings them back into a kind of childlike uprightness, these being the sort who are treated leniently. But in that uprightness there is also, due to their fantasy, a strong desire to surpass others in understanding. Their understanding, however, is taken captive and tied up, for the reason either that they love their own [thoughts], and then can hardly bear it when others utter truer or better ones, or that they do not want the good repute of their own group, consequently of themselves, to be detracted from - thus also because of [a desire] for eminence of self above others.<p>Being in this state of induced uprightness, they are so tormented by that hidden desire, that they ardently want to be released from it and to return into their original condition. Yet for others, in this [childlike] state one can be happy, because one is then outside of the worrying state. 1747, the 31st day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 437</h4><p>437. A SPECIES OF VASTATION BY THE INDUCTION OF A PROBITY, AS IT WERE INFANTILE <p>This mild species of vastation is also assigned to some, that they are reduced to a kind of probity, as it were, infantile. They are such as those to whom clemency is shown. But in that probity there is also present from their phantasy the cupidity of excelling others in understanding; this is held captive and restrained because either they love their own things and thus take it ill that others should say things truer and better than themselves, or they are unwilling that honor should be detracted from those connected with them, and thus from themselves. In this way also [they act] from [the thought] of their own excellence above others. In the induced state of that probity they are tormented by the hidden cupidity that they ardently desire to be released therefrom and return to their former state, even though that state is to others such that a man can be happy in it, for he is then outside that state which disquiets. 1747, Dec. 31. </p>
