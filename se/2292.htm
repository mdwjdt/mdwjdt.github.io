<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2292</h4><p>2292. That even if they were being prepared to eternity, they could never possess life as their own, is evident from this consideration, among others, that there are so many evils in the earthly mind that there is nothing but evil, increased by parents since the first human being, as well as by each individual, during the whole course of their lives. Yet in order to be in heaven, there must be interaction, which cannot possibly exist except in most general things.<p>Take, for example, just one single idea, which contains countless elements, and all those countless elements are evil, forming an association of evils coming from all directions - because an idea is an image of the person-thus of evils from the first parent, and evils the person has acquired. Now because a single idea is of that nature, and there are countless ideas belonging to just one kind of desire, and the kinds of desire also are innumerable as to genus, species and type-then how can anyone ever be reformed so that correspondence may exist, except in only a few things? Through these few things the Lord leads them into heaven and keeps them in the heavens. 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2292</h4><p>2292. That, should they be prepared to eternity, they could never possess life as their own, is evident from other facts as well as from this; that there are so many evils in the natural mind, that [there is] nothing [there] but evil augmented by parents, by the first man, and through themselves during the whole course of their life; when yet, in order that they may be in heaven, there must be correspondence, which can never be given save in most general things. As, for example, if but one idea be assumed wherein are indefinite things, and all the indefinites are evils made up by associated evils on every side, because [the idea] is an image of the man, therefore [made up] of evils from the first parent, and of acquired evils; since, therefore, a single idea is of such a quality, and the indefinite things of the idea are such as pertain but to one kind of cupidity, and the kinds of cupidity [are] also innumerable in genus, species, and particular, how then can man ever be reformed so that there may be correspondence, except only in a few things, by which few the Lord leads them to heaven and keeps them in the heavens. - 1748, June 11. </p>

Quod si in aeternum praepararentur, quod nusquam potuissent vitam possidere ut suam, constat ut ex aliis, etiam ex eo, quod tot mala sint in mente naturali, ut nihil nisi malum sit, auctum a parentibus, a primo homine, et per semet, in toto vitae eorum cursu, cum tamen, ut esse possint <sup>1</sup></p><p>in coelo, correspondentia oporteat esse, quae dari nusquam potest, nisi in communissimis: sicut pro exemplo si modo una idea sumatur, in qua indefinita sunt, et omnia indefinita sunt mala, consociata a malis undique, quia est imago hominis, sic a malis a primo parente, et malis acquisitis-cum <sup>2</sup></p><p>itaque una idea talis sit, et indefinitae ideae sunt quae ad unam solum cupiditatis speciem pertinentt et species cupiditatis etiam innumerabiles, in genere, specie, et particulari-quid <sup>3</sup></p><p>tunc usquam reformari possit homo, ut correspondentia sit, nisi in paucis modo? per quae pauca, Dominus ducit eos in coelum, et tenet in coelis. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
