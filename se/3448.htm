<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3448</h4><p>3448. When examined also as to whether or not he wanted to rule over others, it was found that he was of that mind to desire to be in charge of all others, thus not only the king, whom he transferred between his feet, (whom he also wanted to convince of such things, but then did not dare to) - but also desired to be over everyone else. So the love of self was dominant in him. This was made evident by the foul attempts of such spirits [to persuade me], who have become most familiar to me over a long period of time. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3448</h4><p>3448. Being examined also as to whether he wished to rule over others, it was detected that he had in his mind a desire to hold all others in subjection, thus not only the king [above-mentioned], whom he transferred under his feet, and into whom he wished to infuse persuasions, but did not fully dare to do it, but he wished to exercise the same dominion over everyone else; so supreme with him was the love of self. This was evinced by the vile attempts, to this end, of similar spirits, who for a long time have been well known to me. </p>

Examinatus quoque, annon aliis imperare vellet, et detectum quod animo hoc habuerit ut omnibus aliis imperare cuperet, sic ut non modo regi, quem transmisit inter pedes suos; cui etiam talia voluit persuadere, sed non dein ausus est; praeter quod cuicunque alii cuperet imperare; ita erat regnans apud eum amor sui; ostensum hoc per foedos talium conatus, qui notissimi mihi facti per multum temporis. </p>
