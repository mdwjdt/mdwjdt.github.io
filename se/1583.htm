<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1583</h4><p>1583. The qualities of spirits can be recognized at once by inward spirits, that is, those who are the inner sense<p>One spirit who wanted to get credit for his deeds and doctrine in the world, on going far away toward the front, came to those who are the inner sense, namely, to the spirits of the planet Saturn. Then he declared that he was nothing, and that he would like to be their servant. But at his very first approach, they immediately replied that he wants to be great, and thus claims much credit to himself, and that they themselves, being small, cannot be with great people. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1583</h4><p>1583. THAT THE QUALITIES OF SPIRITS CAN BE KNOWN AT ONCE BY THOSE WHO ARE INTERIOR, OR WHO CONSTITUTE AN INTERNAL SENSE. <p>(A certain spirit, who would fain arrogate merit to himself from his acts and his doctrine in the world, proceeding to a great distance in front, came to those who constitute the internal sense or to the spirits of the earth Saturn, and said that he was nothing, and that he was desirous of serving them. But at his very first approach, they replied that [they saw that] he wished to be great, and that they being small could not be with the great, thus intimating how much he arrogated to himself.) </p>

Quod spirituum qualitates illico cognosci possint, ab iis qui sunt interiores,seu sensus internus<p>Quidam spiritus, qui sibi arrogare voluit meritum, ex suis actis, et sua doctrina, in mundo, is antrorsum in longinquum abiens, venit ad eos, qui sunt sensus internus, seu ad spiritus telluris Saturni, dixitque quod nihil sit, quodque <sup>1</sup></p><p>iis deservire vellet, sed ii statim ad primum appulsum, respondebant, quod magnus velit esse, et quod ii quia parvi, cum magnis esse non possint, et sic quod sibi arroget multa.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quoque </p>
