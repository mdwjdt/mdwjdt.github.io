<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1294</h4><p>1294. About his being black, they said that he could become as white as they are if he would only have his hairs pulled off in the trough, like the swine, which were also in sight. In this way he would certainly become white. For they had been made white in the same way, they said. But this he did not want, saying that he was not like them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1294</h4><p>1294. They said that he was black, but that he could become white like them in the same manner as the pigs, which were also in sight, were stripped of their hair in a trough; in this way he would assuredly become white, for they said that in a similar manner they had been made white. But this he was unwilling to do, saying that he was not such as they. </p>
