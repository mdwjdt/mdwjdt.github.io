<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4111</h4><p>4111. Punishments of this kind last for a long time, for many years, and for many centuries, as in the case of the dragon, of David, carrying with them a purging, but still, a final purging follows, whereby they are dissociated from their like, and because they then have scarcely any company, they sit in darkness, and in torment, with little life, until they become such that they are able to serve some use. Thus they are constantly descending to the last stage of their punishment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4111</h4><p>4111. Such punishments continue for a long time, even through many years and many ages, as, for instance with the dragon David; and they carry with them a process of vastation, but yet a final vastation follows, by which he is dissociated from those of such a character, and because he is then in scarcely any society he sits in darkness and in torture, with very little life, until he becomes capable of rendering some kind of use; thus he continually descends to the ultimate of his punishment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4111 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4111. Tales poenae perstant diu, per plures annos, et per plura saecula, sicut cum dracone, Davide, quae quoque vastationem secum habent, sed usque ultima vastatio sequitur, quod dissocietur a talibus, et quia tunc vix in aliquo consortio, tunc sedet in tenebris, et in cruciatu, cum pauca vita, usque dum talis factus, ut alicui usui inservire possit, ita continue descendit ad ultimum suae poenae; </p>
