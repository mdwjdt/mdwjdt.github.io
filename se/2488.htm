<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2488</h4><p>2488. With the forms of inward things it is different. These have been distorted by hereditary evil, and therefore their state is an evil one, to which all and the very least things in them conspire. And the distortion from this inborn condition can by no means be restored, but only be reduced to nothing, so that it is rendered senseless as by sleep, or by death, and so it seems as if it were submitting itself, when yet this is not a real submission, because it conspires, from every point and center, toward evil, which is its state. Therefore this is only its mortification and being put to sleep, so that the very inward qualities, which are the Lord's, can operate. 1748, 2 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2488</h4><p>2488. They are not hurt: It is otherwise with forms of interiors: these are distorted from hereditary evil, so that their state is evil, whereto conspire each and all things; and what is distorted from this origin [nativitate], this can by no means be restored, but only reduced to naught, so that it is lulled, as it were, by sleep, or, as it were, by death, and so seems, as it were, to apply itself, when yet there is not application [thereof], because [it is applied] to evil, which is its state. It conspires from single points and centers; therefore, it is merely its mortification and lulling to sleep, so that the more interior things, which are the Lord's, may be able to operate. - 1748, July 2. </p>
