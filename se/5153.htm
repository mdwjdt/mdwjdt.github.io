<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5153</h4><p>5153. As regards heaven and the indescribable wisdom and happiness of those in it, it consists in this: in everything before their eyes, they see the Divine and Heavenly things that are represented. On this account when they hold their eyes on outer things, their minds are held on inner ones, thus on Divine things. The things that appear are indescribable, as for instance such things as Paradisiacal Gardens with trees, fruits, flowers, etc., etc. In all these they see such things as they represent, grouped in series. Just as the eye sees a whole meadow in a moment, so the mind sees all things pertaining to the Divine wisdom in one complex in an awe-inspiring series. Consequently they are indescribable. Everything gleams of gold, of silver, and of precious stones, in indescribable forms, all of which envelop Divine things in their order, which they are aware of at the same moment. This produces an inward and outward delight at the same moment. Love enkindles everything, down to the least elements. They also appear beautiful according to their love, and from this, according to their reception of wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5153</h4><p>5153. As respects heaven, and the ineffable wisdom and happiness of those there, it consists in the circumstance, that, in every object they see before their eyes, they see the divine and celestial things which are represented in them. Wherefore, when they keep their eyes on external objects, their mind is kept in internals, thus, in divine things. The objects which appear are ineffable, as Paradises, with trees, fruits, flowers, etc., etc. In all of these they see such things as they represent, in a series; for instance, just at the same time that the eye beholds fresh verdure, the mind sees, in a complex, all things, in a wonderful series, which relate to the Divine Wisdom; consequently, unspeakable things. Everything glistens with gold, silver and precious stones, in indescribable forms; all of which involve Divine things in their order, which they, then, at the same time, perceive. Hence they enjoy interior and exterior delights, simultaneously. Love irradiates all things, on the whole and in detail. They also appear beautiful, according to their love and consequent reception of wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5153 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5153. Quod coelum, eorum sapientiam et felicitatem ineffabilem attinet, consistit ea in eo, quod in omnibus quae vident ante oculos illorum videant Divina et Coelestia quae repraesentantur, quare cum oculos tenent in externis, mens eorum tenetur in internis, ita in Divinis; sunt ineffabilia quae apparent, ut Paradisi, cum arboribus, fructibus, floribus etc. etc., in illis omnibus vident in serie talia quae repraesentant, sicut oculus simul videt integra vireta, ita mens simul omnia in complexu quae sunt sapientiae Divinae, in admiranda serie, proinde ineffabilia: fulgent omnia ex auro, argento, lapidibus pretiosis, in formis ineffabilibus, quae omnia involvunt Divina in suo ordine, quae simul tunc percipiunt, inde illis delectatio interior et exterior, simul: amor accendit omnia et singula: pulchra etiam apparent secundum amorem eorum, et inde receptionem sapientiae. </p>
