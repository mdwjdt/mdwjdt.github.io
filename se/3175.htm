<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3175</h4><p>3175. There are two contraries in man and spirit<p>By experience I was taught that there can be two contraries in man and spirit, that he wants, and does not want [something]-the outer one so strong that he does not at all want it, but the inner one such that he cannot but want it. One experience is in the case of someone in whom I was allowed to see this, the other in the case of those from Jupiter who, being attacked by spirits of our planet, admitted that they did not want to remain, but from their inner parts, admitted that they cannot but want to remain: so in many other cases. 1748, 16 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3175</h4><p>3175. THAT THERE ARE GIVEN TWO CONTRARIES IN MAN AND SPIRIT. <p>I have been taught by experience, that in man or spirit can be given two contraries, to will, and not to will, [quod velit et non velit], and the external [may be] so strong that he never wills, but the internal [be] such that he cannot [do] other than will: one experience is in a certain one, in whom such a thing was granted to perceive; the other [experience] is in spirits of Jupiter, who were infested by spirits of our planet, who confessed that they do not wish to remain: but from internals confessed that they could not but wish to remain. [It is] so in many other things. - 1748, September 16. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3175 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3175. Quod dentur bina contraria in homine et spiritu<p>Ab experientia doctus, quod in homine aut spiritu dari queant duo contraria, quod velit et non velit, et externum tam forte, ut nusquam velit, at internum tale, ut non possit aliter ac velle, una experientia est in quodam, in quo tale percipere datum, altera in Jovialibus, qui infestati a spiritibus nostrae telluris fassi, quod non velint manere, sed ab internis, fassi quod non possint quin velint manere: ita in pluribus aliis. 1748, 16 Sept. </p>
