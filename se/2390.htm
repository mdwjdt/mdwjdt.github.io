<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2390</h4><p>2390. This shows that if the Lord had not come into the world at that time, all would have perished, and the communication of heaven with mankind would have been broken off, so the human race would have had to perish for the lack of an intermediate agency through the spiritual world for its instruction in the work of regeneration. 1748, 22 June. For the angels cannot stream into human thoughts manifestly, but only through mediating spirits arranged under them, because the angels' thought and speech is incomprehensible to earthly humans and inside of their thinking. Consequently it cannot stream into anyone's preaching. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2390</h4><p>2390. Hence it may be evident that unless the Lord had then come into the world, all would have perished, and the communication of heaven with men would have been broken. Hence the human race could not but perish, because there was no mediate cause, through the spiritual world, by which they might be instructed in the work of regeneration, for angels cannot inflow into man's thought, manifestly, save through subordinate or mediate spirits; for such is the thought and speech of angels, as to be incomprehensible to man, and within his thought: therefore nothing could be predicated of it [proinde non in ullius predicationem], therefore it could not publish anything. 1748, June 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2390 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2390. Inde constare potest, quod nisi Dominus tunc venerit in mundum, quod perierint omnes, et communicatio coeli cum hominibus foret rupta, inde genus humanum non potuit non perire, quia nulla causa media per spiritualem mundum, per quem instruerentur in opere regenerationis, 1748, 22 Junius; nam angeli non possunt influere in cogitationem hominis, manifeste, nisi per spiritus subordinatos <sup>1</sup></p><p>seu medios--nam <sup>2</sup></p><p>talis est angelorum cogitatio et loquela, ut incomprehensibilis sit homini, et intra ejus cogitationem--proinde <sup>3</sup></p><p>non in ullius praedicationem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has medios; nam<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has cogitationem; proinde </p>
