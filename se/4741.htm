<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4741</h4><p>4741. About a certain people in the universe and about Charles XII <sup>1</sup><p>There was a certain one who was the most obstinate of mortals on this earth (Charles XII). He was so obstinate that he was never willing to give up what he was determined to do but would persist in it even if he were to suffer the most cruel death or horrifying hell. And when he decided to do what is evil, he was able to justify his obstinate determination with such things as appeared to arise from a motive not in itself evil. For example, when he desired to deflower some woman and to do this with a surreptitious use of power, he made up [the reason] that he wanted to be freed of this evil, and that if he could not be freed in another way [than by this act], he would be sent into a horrible hell. It seemed as if he [truly] desired this [i.e., to be freed]. Consequently his motive for doing this appeared to be that he wanted to become better. Nonetheless, he persisted very stubbornly in this diabolical evil. So also, when he lived in the world and lost his country and everyone in it by obeying Gortz, <sup>2</sup>he said that he wished his country well. He was unwilling to see that this was not so. But the fact was that he persisted in his determination with utmost stubbornness and that he never desisted until driven to such impossible straits that there was nothing else left [to do]. This was shown as well as that in itself it was diabolical. He, however, believed that it would be for his country's glory, but it was shown that he be might considered to be insane.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For information on this person see footnote for passage <a href="4704.htm">4704</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;German statesman who was a key financial and diplomatic adviser to King Charles XII of Sweden. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4741</h4><p>4741. CONCERNING A CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND CONCERNING CHARLES XII.<p>There was a certain one, who had been the most obstinate of mortals of this earth (Charles XII). He was so obstinate that he was never willing to desist from his purpose, but would remain in it, though be should suffer either the cruelest death or the most atrocious hell; and, when he concluded to do evil, he was also able to confirm his stubborn purpose by such things as appeared to spring from an end not evil in itself: as, for example, when he wished to deflower any virgin, and this by secret violence, he invented [for a pretext] that he wished to be liberated from that evil, and that if it could not happen otherwise, he would be let down into another hell: he appeared as if he wished this. Hence his apparent end, according to this, was, that he wished to become better; but, yet, he remained most persistently in that diabolical evil. So, also, when he lived in the world, and lost his country and all who were in it by obeying Gjortz, he said that he wished well to the country: he was not willing to see that such was not the case, but that he most obstinately remained in the purpose never to desist, before he was brought to such extremities that nothing remained. This was shown, and, also, that, in itself, it was diabolical: he believed, however, that this must be the glory of his country; but it was shown that he ought to be considered as insane. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4741 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4741. De quodam populo in universo et de C: XII<p>Erat quidam qui obstinatissimus mortalium hujus telluris fuerat (Carol. XII), is tam obstinatus fuit, ut a sententia sua nusquam desistere vellet, sed permaneret in illa si vel crudelissimam mortem subiret, aut atrocissimum infernum, etiam cum malum facere conclusit, contumacem suam sententiam confirmare potuit talibus, quae apparerent ex fine non malo pro se; ut pro exemplo cum voluit deflorare aliquam, et hoc vi furtiva, invenit quod vellet a malo illo liberari, et si non aliter fieri posset, ut demitteretur in atrox infernum, apparebat sicut hoc vellet, inde finis apparens pro eo quod vellet meliorescere, sed usque pertinacissime mansit in malo illo diabolico; ita quoque cum vixit in mundo, cum patriam et omnes ibi perderet, obediendo G�rtz, dixit quod vellet patriae bene, non voluit videre quod tale non esset, sed quod obstinatissime permaneret in sententia, quod nusquam desisteret antequam in tales incitas redactus esset, ut nihil superesset, quod ostensum, et quoque quod in se diabolicum, sed credidit quod hoc foret gloria patriae, sed ostensum quod consideraretur ut insanus. </p>
