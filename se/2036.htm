<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2036</h4><p>2036. Later this same spirit was transferred to a different place, and in fact, to the province of the heart, and there good spirits and angels protected him with extreme watchfulness and care, so that he would be concealed from the evil spirits and they would not know where he was.<p>This task was assigned to angels who had that concern, guarding him in every way. By means of spiritual mental images, they encircled him, so to speak, and in watchful care, they did him many other services, all of which made it clear how angels protect good souls, and how, in the process, they likewise are taught to be compassionate. </p>

He was afterwards transferred to another place, even to the province of the heart, and their good spirits and angels defended and screened him with much solicitous care from the evil, that they might not know where he was. This was committed to angels who were then especially in that solicitude, aiming by every method to defend him, and for that purpose forming, according to spiritual ideas, a kind of guardian circle around him. From the same solicitous care they performed a great many other kind offices in his behalf, from whence it was given to know how the angels defend good souls, and they in like manner are formed to the exercise of a similar compassion. </p>

Postea idem in locum alium translatus est, et quidem in provinciam cordis, et ibi spiritus boni et angeli multa sollicitudine et cura eum tutati <sup>1</sup></p><p>, ut absconderetur a malis, utque nescirent mali, ubinam esset, id commissum erat angelis, qui tunc in sollicitudine ista erant, et omnibus modis eum tutati, et secundum ideas spirituales, eum circum quasi cinxerunt, et plura ex sollicita cura egerunt, inde scire dabatur, quomodo angeli tutantur animas bonas, et ii similiter tunc formantur, ut in miseratione sint.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
