<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2372</h4><p>2372. Anything evil that occurs, even the slightest, comes from evil spirits<p>Evil spirits have sometimes declared that they had not been the cause of something bad that had happened, because it happened as if by accident, and they were unaware that it was they, and so did not want to acknowledge that it came from them. They received the answer, however, that it was still from them, even though it happened as if by accident and they did not do it deliberately, because the general evil that emanates from them brings such a string of consequences with it.<p>This was borne out today also, when I was being held by some for quite a long time in a kind of ignorance or darkness, and then certain badly written, even erroneous things crept in - not that they wanted this, but because they were holding me in obscurity, and were the kind who wanted on their own power to control everything that was being written; hence the obscurity, so that each of the slips and errors, even the slightest ones, came from them, for it would have been entirely different, had I been in the light of the Lord. The same applies in other cases. 1748, 22 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2372</h4><p>2372. THAT WHATEVER EVIL HAPPENS, EVEN THE LEAST, COMES FROM EVIL SPIRITS. <p>Evil spirits have sometimes said that they could not have been the cause that any evil had happened, because it was as it were accidental, and they were ignorant what they were, therefore did not wish to acknowledge that it proceeded from them; but it was replied that still it proceeds from them, although it is as if accidental, and as if they do not do it from their will, because the common evil which flows from them, has as it were, continually with itself such consequences. This was also shown today, by this: I was kept by certain ones in a sort of ignorance or obscurity and for quite a long time; then certain badly written and erroneous things crept in, not that they willed it, but because they kept me in [that] obscurity, and were of such a character as wished to rule from themselves those things that were written; hence the obscurity, wherefore, the single slips and errors, even the least proceeded from them, for it is entirely different when I enjoy the light of the Lord. It happened similarly in the rest [other things]. - 1748, June 92. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2372 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2372. Quod quicquid mali accidit, etiam minimum, ex malis spiritibus veniat<p>Dixerunt mali spiritus quandoque, quod ii non in causa fuerint, quod acciderit aliquod malum, quia quasi fortuitum, et nesciebant quod ii essent, sic <sup>1</sup></p><p>non voluerunt agnoscere quod ab iis, sed responsum est, quod usque ab iis, tametsi quasi fortuitum, et ii id non ex voluntate agant, quia commune malum, quod ab iis fluit, ea ut consequentia, quasi continua secum habet; quod hodie ostensum quoque per id, quod [cum] in ignorantiae specie, seu obscuritate tenerer a quibusdam, et satis diu, tunc, quaedam male scripta, etiam erronea, irrepserunt, non quod ii id vellent, sed quia in obscuritate me tenebant, et tales essent, ut ex se regere vellent ea, quae scriberentur, inde obscuritas, quare lapsus et errores singuli, etiam minimi, ab iis, nam aliter prorsus, si in luce Domini, similiter fit in caeteris. 1748, 22 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
