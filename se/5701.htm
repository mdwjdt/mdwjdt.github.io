<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5701</h4><p>5701. There are also others like this. A certain one also could attack others so cleverly and compose his wit in such expressions that he could pierce into the inner feelings of a person's mind, with which [words] such things were mixed as were matters of learning and of inner cleverness made up of things in his memory. They also supposed he had an understanding of such a nature, but examined, he had none: he [could] not even look at anything from an inward point of view (Gustav Benzelst[ierna] <sup>1</sup>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See footnoted information on him in passage <a href="4851.htm">4851</a>. </p>
