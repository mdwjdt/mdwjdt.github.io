<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2273</h4><p>2273. I was shown by actual experience just how things stood with the prophets of that time. Throughout a whole night in which I was awake off and on, even until morning, I was obsessed by spirits who took such possession of my body and all its parts, that I hardly knew, except very faintly, that it was my body. Nevertheless I was still myself, I could think separately, but as if I were closed out of the body, or had the scantiest part of my body, while spirits occupied the whole of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2273</h4><p>2273. How it was with the prophets of that time was shown me to the living experience for during a whole night, in which I waked at intervals [vicibus] until morning, I was obsessed by spirits, who so occupied my body, and all that belonged to my body, that I hardly knew, but in a very obscure manner, that it was my body: nevertheless I was still myself [eram mihi], I could think apart from [my body], but as if excluded from the body, and having the thinnest part of [my] body, since spirits occupied the whole [thereof]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2273 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2273. Quomodo se res haberet cum prophetis istius temporis, mihi ad vivam experientiam ostensum est; nam per totam noctem, in qua vicibus evigilabam, usque ad mane, eram obsessus a spiritibus, qui ita occupabant corpus meum, et omne quod corporis mei esset, ut vix scirem, quam obscurissime, quod meum esset corpus, usque tamen eram mihi, cogitare potui seorsim, sed sicut exclusus a corpore, vel exiguissimam partem corporis habens, cum totum occuparent spiritus. </p>
