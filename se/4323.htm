<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4323</h4><p>4323. About the devil himself, regarded from purpose<p>There was a certain one who imagined himself to be the devil who deceived Adam and Eve, with whom Paul associated himself. He appeared just like any other spirit, not speaking badly, rather as if he were a person on earth, but in obscurity. I was surprised that he was of this kind, because no hatreds, vengefulness, cruelties, or adulteries, were felt coming from him, as they were from others, but I was instructed that he did not bother about such things, but only motives aimed at destroying goodness and truth, so that he has no other intention. It is motives that judge a person, and as they are like this they are devils themselves, for they deeply conceal their endeavors, and act from that very worst of purposes, using whatever means are at hand, profane or holy. 1749, 13 July. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Jupiter, meaning Thursday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4323</h4><p>4323. CONCERNING THE DEVIL HIMSELF, FROM THE END [PROPOSED].<p>There was a certain one who thought himself to be the devil that seduced Adam and Eve, and to whom Paul adjoined himself. He appeared like another spirit, not speaking badly, as if he were a man, but still in a kind of obscurity. I wondered at his quality, as a sense of hatreds, revenges, cruelties, and adulteries was not perceived from him as from others; but I was instructed that he cared not for such things, but had in view only the end of destroying good and truth, so that nothing else entered into his intention. Ends are what judge a man, and because of those this class are prompted by such ends they are very devils, for they deeply conceal their aims, and act from the detestable prompting above mentioned, regardless of the means whether profane or holy. - 1749, July 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4323 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4323. De ipso diabolo, ex fine<p>Quidam fuit, qui se putabat diabolum qui seduxit Adam et Eva, cui se associavit Paulus, is apparebat sicut alius spiritus, non loquutus male, quasi homo esset, sed in obscuro, miratus quod is talis, quia non odia, vindictae, crudelitates, adulteria ab eo sentiebantur, ut ab aliis, sed instructus, quod is talia non curet, sed modo fines perdendi bonum et verum, sic ut nihil aliud intendat, fines sunt qui judicant hominem, et quia tales sunt, sunt ipsi diaboli, nam alte recondunt suos conatus, et ex pessimo illo fine agunt, etiam per quaecunque media, prophana vel sancta. 1749, 13 Julius. </p>
