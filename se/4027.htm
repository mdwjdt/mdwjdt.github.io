<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4027</h4><p>4027. Then above my forehead there opened up something lucid, of a yellowish brilliance, through certain openings, small but larger at the center, within which there were some who looked small on account of being so high up, who appeared snowy white in the rather yellowish brightness. Later, holes appeared, but in a different arrangement, regular, like the cells of bees, which they could look through toward me - and through which also the yellowish light shone brightly. After that also there appeared longer holes in the same arrangement, through which the light did not shine so brightly, then fainter ones, and very faint ones, and then a kind of snow white light appeared, but a faint one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4027</h4><p>4027. There was then opened above the forehead a certain lucid something, of a beautiful yellow hue, through certain intervening apertures of larger and smaller size, within which were certain spirits who seemed small from their great height, while in the very bright yellowish light were those who appeared of a snowy whiteness. There were afterwards seen opening [foramina] but differently disposed, being arranged regularly like the cells of bees, through which the inmates would look towards me, and through which also there shone a perceptible yellowish light. Afterwards there appeared larger openings of similar arrangement, through which the light did not thus clearly penetrate; these openings appeared more and more obscure, till finally there was seen a certain snowy light, but still obscure. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4027 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4027. Tunc supra frontem aperiebatur lucidum quoddam pulchre flavescens, per aperturas quasdam, parvas et majorem in medio, intus erant quidam, visi propter altitudinem parvi, in admodum lucido flavescente, qui nivei apparebant: postea visa foramina sed alia dispositione, regulariter sicut favi apum, per quae transspicerent versus me; per quae etiam lux patebat flavescens manifesta: postea quoque foramina similis dispositionis longiora, per quae lux non ita pateret; tum obscuriora et obscurissima, dein visa quaedam lux nivea, sed obscura. </p>
