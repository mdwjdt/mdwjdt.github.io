<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1983</h4><p>1983. About memory<p>I have learned from experience that there is an inward memory, by means of which the memory of material and bodily images is aroused. That memory is permanent in spirits as well, and from it, when it pleases the Lord, everything can be raised that had been stored in the memory of sense impressions.<p>I have learned repeatedly that such a memory exists, more perfect than the bodily memory, in fact, that what a person thinks to be forgotten is nevertheless impressed on that memory, but buried by sensual elements. This can be seen also from dreams and other indications.<p>But besides this memory, there is also a yet deeper one, namely, a memory of spiritual mental images, enabling them to think and to speak, and by this deeper one, that inward memory is raised. By this spiritual memory, spirits greatly surpass man, being able to think much more exquisitely and clearly, so that their mental abilities are increased beyond those they possessed in bodily life. This can be corroborated by numerous past experiences, spoken of elsewhere [<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="1077.htm">1077</a>]. 1748, 17 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1983</h4><p>1983. CONCERNING MEMORY. <p>I have learned from experience that there is an interior from which is excited the memory of material and corporeal ideas, and that such a memory remains also with spirits from which, at the good pleasure of the Lord, those things that have been stored up in the memory of sensual ideas are excited. That there is such a memory, and that it is more perfect than the memory of the body, is a fact which has been forced upon me by many proofs; yea, even that which man supposes forgotten is still lodged in that memory, though buried up in sensuals. The same thing may be inferred from dreams and other indications. But beside this memory, there is a memory still more interior, namely, of spiritual ideas, by the and of which thought and speech may be carried on, and this it is by which that [first] interior memory is excited. By means of that spiritual memory spirits possess a great advantage over men, so that they can think much more subtly and distinctly; thus their faculties are vastly augmented in comparison with what they were in the life of the body. This was confirmed by an abundant experience, concerning which elsewhere. - 1748, May 17. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1983 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1983. De memoria<p>Ab experientia didici, quod memoria sit interior, ex qua excitatur memoria idearum materialium et corporearum, et quod talis memoria remaneat quoque penes spiritus, e qua excitantur ea, Domino sic beneplacente, quae fuerunt in memoria idearum sensualium; quod talis memoria sit, et quod perfectior memoria corporis, hoc multis didici, imo quod oblitum homo putat, in ea memoria usque inest, sed obruitur a sensualibus; sicut etiam constare a somnis, aliisque indiciis potest: sed praeter hanc memoriam, etiam memoria adhuc interior est, nempe idearum spiritualium, cujus ope possunt cogitare, et loqui, et haec est qua excitatur ea interior memoria; memoria ista spirituali pollent spiritus multum prae hominibus, sic ut cogitare queant multo subtilius, et distinctius, inde facultates eorum auctae prae eorundem in vita corporis, quod permultis experientiis confirmari potest, de quibus alibi [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1983/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_400" target=_top>400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1983/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1077" target=_top>1077</a>]. 1748, 17 Maj. </p>
