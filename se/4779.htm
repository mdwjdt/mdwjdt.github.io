<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4779</h4><p>4779. At the end, when I left those just spoken of above, I heard them reverently praising the Lord in a great gathering singing Hallelujah.<p>After this I was led to the back, but higher up, where there were spirits from regions of the northern part of Asia, and I realized that their native character from their life in the world was such that they could receive the heavenly doctrine spoken of above. After this I was brought back to a region where those were who were engaged in the sciences, that is to say, in such things as human learning is drinking in today. And there I noted that because of the mere fact that the Lord was human, none of those there could in any way have grasped that He could be the one only God, and not even that He could be a God, and so they could scarcely receive the heavenly doctrine. This was because they had no perception that this can be so since their every gift of perception had been entirely extinguished by the sciences. But in the region there further to the right and lower down were those who had the ability to receive this doctrine because they did not use science in a way that extinguished the gift of perceiving that something is true. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4779</h4><p>4779. At length, when I parted from those about whom I spoke just above, I heard them praising God, very earnestly, in great assembly, singing, Hallelujah. I was afterwards brought back, but higher up, where were spirits from the regions of the north part of Asia; and it was perceived that they were of such a disposition, from their life in the world, as to be able to receive the heavenly doctrine of which I have spoken above. I was afterwards brought back to the region where are those who are in sciences, namely, such things as those from which human learning is at this day imbibed; and it was there observed, that all there were totally unable to apprehend that the Lord can be the only God, merely for the reason that He was a man - and not even that He can be God; and, thus, that these were able to receive the heavenly doctrine in the very smallest degree; for they have no perception that it can be this, because they have by means of sciences extinguished every gift of perception. But, in a region farther to the right there, downwards, were those who were more in the capacity of receiving that doctrine, who had not extinguished, by sciences, the gift of perceiving that a thing is as it is. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4779 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4779. Tandem cum discedebam ab illis, de quibus nunc supra, audiebam illos collaudantes Dominum, in magno coetu, canentes Halleluja. Postea perducebar retro, sed altius, ubi erant spiritus ex regionibus septentrionis partis Asiae, et perceptum quod illi tali genio essent, ex vita in mundo, ut recipere possint doctrinam coelestem, de qua supra: postea reducebar ad regionem ubi illi qui in scientiis, nempe talibus ex quibus eruditio humana hodie potatur, et apperceptum ibi, quod omnes ibi nequaquam potuissent capere, quod Dominus posset esse unicus Deus, solum ex causa quia homo, et ne quidem quod posset esse Deus, et sic quod illi minime recipere possent doctrinam coelestem; nam nulla illis perceptio quod ita possit esse, quia omne donum perceptionis exstinxerant per scientias. At in regione ulterius ad dextrum ibi deorsum magis erant qui in facultate recipiendi doctrinam illam, qui donum perceptionis quod ita sit non per scientias exstinxerant. </p>
