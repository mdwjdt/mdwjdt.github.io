And I realized the cause, that it was flowing in from the advent of the Lord into the world operating, so the cause was imparted. Hence their most pleasant delights, or most delightful pleasures, which flowed in from no other source, just as marriage love and storge, <sup>1</sup>thus together with love no longer inwardly for the partner but only toward the offspring. So I now realize that the love of the partner had passed away, and remained in the love toward offspring, or storge. It is evident also from that Church, and the ancient one that followed, that there was no pleasure they preferred above the love of offspring. This is clear from many considerations, to be discussed elsewhere, if the Lord sees fit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Greek import, meaning, "parental love." </p>

No longer [the love] of the spouse, interiorly, but only towards offspring; wherefore I now perceive that conjugial love perished, and remained within love to offspring or storge. Like as may also be apparent from that Church, and the ancient [one] succeeding; which is evident from many things, which [will be treated] elsewhere, if the Lord think worthy.) </p>
