<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2196</h4><p>2196. I was also allowed to observe how, if they were broken in the least, they at once tended toward hatred against the Lord; and then at the same time, the fact that Jacob's descendants were not in the least broken or forcibly removed from their passions, because they tended toward idol-worship more than other peoples. Consequently, they were left in freedom, and were led to the worship of the Lord gradually, through their passions, which were arrogance of spirit and the world's riches. 1748, 5 June. </p>

It was also given to observe that should they be broken, even in the least, they would forthwith incline to hatred against the Lord, and [it was observed] at the same time that the posterity of Jacob were not broken the least, or forcibly separated from their cupidities, inasmuch as they inclined to idolatry more than others; hence that license was granted them, and they were brought to the worship of the Lord by degrees, by means of their cupidities, which were pride of mind and the wealth of the world.-1748, June 5. </p>

Observare etiam dabatur, si frangerentur vel minimum, quod illico inclinarent in odium contra Dominum, et simul tunc, quod Jacobi posteri ne minime quidem frangerentur, seu a suis cupiditatibus <sup>1</sup></p><p>vi removerentur, quia inclinabant in idololatriam prae aliis, proinde quod iis licentia concessa sit, et perducerentur ad cultum Domini sensim, per eorum cupiditates, quae erant animi superbia, et mundi opes. 1748, 5 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has suis cupiditatibus suis </p>
