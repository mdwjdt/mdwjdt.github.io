<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2771</h4><p>2771. Relatives, friends, companions find one another in the other life<p>By quite a lot of experience I have been allowed to learn that in the other life they find their relatives, friends, companions, and acquaintances, even those who had been known to them in life only by repute, and with them they converse and also enter into their first social relationship. For in the other life, distance is of no account, and those who are a 1000 miles apart, or even if they were 1,000,000, yet they are near. In fact they may be very close by, depending on the quality of their life.<p>Therefore, since it is so that relatives, parents, children, friends, companions, and those in some way acquainted, find one another, it is extremely unfortunate for those who had hated certain ones in bodily life. These also come together with [those they hated] and exercise their hatred, causing extreme distress and unhappiness to those whom they had hated, <sup>1</sup>nor does it hinder them if that is a multitude of souls, as I have been allowed to learn by very much experience.<p>Therefore let people beware of hatred, for their life [there] is so similar to their life in the body, that they do not know they are not living the life of the body. 1748, 8 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original has "who had harbored hatred" where we believe "whom they had hated" was intended; cf. 2774. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2771</h4><p>2771. THAT RELATIVES, FRIENDS, COMPANIONS, MEET WITH EACH OTHER IN THE OTHER LIFE. <p>From considerable experience, it is granted to learn that in the other life they meet with their relatives, friends, companions, and acquaintances, also [those] who were only known to them in life by reputation, and converse with them, and also are at first associated with them: for in the other life distance is of no moment [nihil facit]: those who are separated 1000, or it might be 10,000 miles, are near to them, yea everyone according to his life, so that they can be present next [to them]. Wherefore since it is so that relatives, parents, children, friends, companions and mere acquaintances wherever known [noti quocunque modo] meet each other, [still] it is exceedingly unfortunate for those, who have held any in hatred during the life of the body: these also come together and exercise their hatred, to the very great annoyance and misfortune of those whom they have held in hatred: nor does the multitude of souls cause any hindrance, as was given me to learn from very much experience. Wherefore let them beware of hatred: their life is so similar to their life in the body, that, as regards life, they do not know but they are in the life of the body. - 1748, August 8. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2771 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2771. Quod cognati, amici, socii in altera vita se inveniant <sup>1</sup></p><p>Ex satis multa experientia discere datum est, quod suos cognatos, amicos, socios et notos, etiam qui <sup>2</sup></p><p>modo in vita ex fama iis cogniti fuerunt, in altera vita inveniant, et cum iis colloquantur, et quoque primam societatem habeant; nam in altera vita nihil quicquam facit distantia, qui dissiti sunt 1000, vel si foret 1000,000 milliaribus, iis sunt prope, imo quisque secundum suam vitam, sic ut possint proxime adesse; quare cum ita est, quod cognati, parentes, liberi, amici, socii et noti quocunque modo se inveniant, maxime infaustum est iis, qui <sup>3</sup></p><p>odio quosdam in vita corporis habuerint, etiam ii conveniunt, et exercent sua odia, cum maxima molestia, et infaustitate eorum, qui odio habuerunt; nec quicquam impedit multitudo animarum, quod permulta experientia discere mihi datum est; quare caveant sibi ab odiis, vita eorum est ita similis vitae eorum in corpore, quoad vitam, ut non sciant quam quod in vita corporis sint. 1748, 8 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;post titulum apparet manu B. Chastanier additum vide etiam 2904.<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition: "qui pro de quibus"<p>3.&nbsp;sic manuscript </p>
