When he came there he was let into his inner qualities, which was a state he found pleasing. He told them that they were to give him whatever they had, which they at first refused; but subsequently through the power of his thought and his promises that he would return [these things], he achieved this. Then he wanted them to do entirely as he wished, which he also achieved. After this, out of these possessions he distributed to each and everyone as he favored, to one whom he favored, the most, to others a few, depending on how they pleased him. By this the nature of his character in the world and how his thought stemmed from self-love's covetousness were made plainly visible. He admitted too that he had thought in this way, namely, that if he had absolute power, which he also desired in the highest degree, he would act in this way with all, he would possess everything that belonged to them, and would give to each one depending on their completely and blindly doing as he ordered.

By this was manifested of what character he had been in the world, and how he had thought from the lust of the love of self. He also confessed that he had so thought: namely, that if he had absolute power, which also he coveted in the highest degree, he would do thus with all - he would take possession of all things of theirs, and give to everyone, according to their doing, altogether and blindly, as he ordered. Thus, also, was manifested, that he esteemed himself, as regards intelligence, before all others in the world. </p>
