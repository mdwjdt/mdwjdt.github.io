<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3267</h4><p>3267. About the inhabitants of a certain other world or universe in the starry heaven <sup>1</sup><p>There was a volume, as it were, of spirits, not as compact as the volume of other spirits [<a href="3233.htm">3233</a>], thus more or less separated, and quite stretched out in breadth and length, of which I became aware in the earth beneath me. From this I recognized that it was a certain race of spirits unknown to me. This volume was trying to struggle upwards, thus to come hither, but it was unable, or those spirits were unable. There ever appeared to be some earthen obstacle so that they could not struggle out. So I realized they had a different nature, not compatible with the nature of the spirits of this earth, for right away there was something in the way. So<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Probably meaning "solar system (see 3269)." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3267</h4><p>3267. CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF ANOTHER WORLD, OR SOME UNIVERSE IN THE STARRY HEAVEN.<p>(There was, as it were, a volume of spirits, not so continuous as a volume of other spirits, thus as it were separated [discrete], and quite extended in breadth and length; which was perceived in the earth under me. I thence recognized that it was a certain class [genus] of spirits unknown to me. This volume endeavored to struggle upwards, thus to come hither, but it could not, or those spirits could not. It continually appeared as if held by an object; so that they could not struggle up. It was thus perceived that they had a different nature which did not accord with the nature of spirits of this earth; for there was such an obstacle. </p>
