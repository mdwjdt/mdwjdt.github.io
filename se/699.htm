<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 699</h4><p>699. When I awoke, certain societies of spirits, one after the other, began to declare in a singing, loud voice, that the Wolf had wanted to steal them away, but the Lord had snatched them from the wolf, and that they had then been restored to the Lord. On this account they rejoiced from the depths of their heart. For they had been in despair, extremely afraid that the Lord had rejected them, and that the wolves would therefore seize them and the Lord no longer wanted to keep them. They feared that there was an overabundance of spirits or angels in heaven, so that no room was left to receive more. This was the generally shared thought, which I perceived clearly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 699</h4><p>699. When I awoke, certain societies of spirits, one after the other, began to say in a melodious and raised voice, that the wolf had wanted to carry them away, but that the Lord had snatched them from the wolf, and thus they had been restored to the Lord. As a result of this they rejoiced from the inmost heart, because they had been in despair, fearing greatly that the Lord had rejected them and thus that the wolves would possess them, and fearing that the Lord would not want to have them any longer, that on account of the abundance of spirits and angels in heaven there was no longer any room to receive more. This was in their general thought which I manifestly perceived. </p>
