<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>356.千千万万的人用一口赞美弥赛亚神。在那夜的大部分时间里，众多灵人围绕着我，后来又有众多天使围绕着我；这些天使照着天堂的形式流入，这形式绝无法描述给人的理解力，至于他们如何流动的，更是无法描述；他们用一口，或一个一致的声音说话。这一切在我里面可感觉到，而且确实持续了很长一段时间，以致当他们说话时，再没有比这感觉更明显的了：我看见形式，感觉到流动，听见一致的声音。每个灵人都在众人里面，并且确认自己是众人的一部分，因而所有人一起和每一个人单独，或所有人联合和每个人单个如此行。从他们的流动还能感觉到他们是否已经如此开始，以致他们也能在属灵和属天的真理上达到一种相似的一致性。因此，后来，我周围的天使或许数以万计；而且有一段时间，他们的流动的确是可察觉的，但具有这种性质，我只知道他们正在以一种内在天堂的形式流动，因为我察觉不到更内在形式的流动。这些天使后来告诉我，在一整夜和几个清醒的状态下，他们除了赞美弥赛亚神外，什么也没做，并且怀着内心至内在的喜悦来赞美，以致他们不愿从这种状态中被放出来。由此可得出以下结论：一致性是和谐形式的结果；此外还能从中得出更多结论。（1747年12月16日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 356</h4><p>356. A thousand and tens of thousands together praise God the Messiah with one mouth<p>For much of the night a multitude of spirits was around me, and afterwards a multitude of angels, flowing in accordance with a heavenly pattern that cannot be described to the human understanding; still less can it be described how they move, and speak with one mouth, or with a unanimous voice. This was so perceptible within me, and indeed for so long a time uninterruptedly, that as they speak, nothing could be more clearly witnessed: I saw the pattern, I felt the flow, I heard the unanimity of voice. Each spirit is, and affirms that he is, part of the multitude, thus all together and each one singly, or [all] collectively and [each] individually.<p>From their flow, one can also sense whether they are as yet initiated to such an extent that they can reach a similar unanimity in respect to spiritual and heavenly truths as well; so that afterwards, there were perhaps tens of thousands of angels around me and indeed, for a long time, whose flow, while perceptible, was nevertheless of such a kind that I could not but assume that they were streaming in an inward heavenly pattern, <sup>1</sup>since I could not perceive any flow in a very inward pattern.<p>Afterwards they told me that through the entire night, and several wakeful periods, they were doing nothing else but praising God the Messiah, and doing so with an innermost gladness of heart, so they had not wanted to be let out of that state.<p>From this, one can gather that unanimity is the result of a harmonious configuration; besides other conclusions one could draw from it. [Cf. 289-89 1/2.] 1747, 16 December.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262, footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 356</h4><p>356. THAT THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS TOGETHER PRAISE GOD MESSIAH WITH ONE MOUTH <p>For a great part of the night there was a multitude of spirits about me, and afterwards a multitude of angels, who flow according to the heavenly form, which form can by no means be described to the human understanding, still less how they flow; and they speak as a one, or with a unanimous voice, which was so perceptible with me, and indeed for a long time in continuation, that as they are speaking nothing is more evident: the form was perceived, the flow was perceived, the unanimity of the voice was perceived. Each one is in the multitude, and considers himself to be: so do all and each, or in general and particular. It can be perceived from their flow, whether they are as yet so initiated that they are also able to act with similar unanimity in spiritual and celestial truths. Wherefore afterwards there were angels around me - perhaps myriads - and this for some time, whose flow was indeed perceptible, but such that I could know no more than that they were flowing in an interior heavenly form; the flow of the more interior form could not be perceived. These angels afterwards told me that throughout the whole night and during some wakeful states they had done nothing else than together praise God Messiah, and indeed with an inmost gladness, so that they were unwilling to be let out of that state. Hence it can be concluded that unanimity results from the harmony of form, besides many more things which can thence be concluded. 1747, Dec. 16. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 356 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>356. Quod mille et myriades simul uno ore collaudent Deum Messiam<p>Per multum noctis circum me erat multitudo spirituum, et postea multitudo angelorum, qui secundum coelestem formam fluunt, quae forma describi ad intellectum humanum nequit, minus quomodo fluunt, ac uno [ore] seu unanima voce loquuntur, quod tam perceptibile penes me fuit, et quidem diu in continuatione, ut sicut loquantur, nihil testatius: forma percepta, fluxio percepta, vocis unanimitas percepta, unusquisque est in multitudine, et autumat se esse, ita omnes et singuli, seu in communi et particulari; ex fluxu eorum percipi potest, num adhuc ita sint, ut queant etiam in veris spiritualibus et coelestibus similem unanimitatem agere; quare angeli postmodum, forte myriades circum me erant, et quidem diu, quorum fluxus quidem perceptibilis erat, sed talis, ut nihil scire potuerim, quam quod fluerent in forma interiori coelesti, intimioris <sup>1</sup></p><p>formae fluxus, non potuit percipi; postea mihi dicebant, quod per integram noctem, et aliquot vigilias, nihil aliud egerint, quam quod collaudarint Deum Messiam, et quidem cum intima eorum laetitia, sic ut e statu illo non voluerint emitti; inde concludi potest quod unanimitas ex formae harmonia resultet, praeter plura quae inde concludi possunt. 1747, 16 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has intimiois </p>
