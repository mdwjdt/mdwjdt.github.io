<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2380</h4><p>2380. About people who dwell only on words in the Lord's Word, and are little concerned with the meaning [see <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>]<p>It appeared to me that I was under an arched place. There was a vaulted ceiling as is common in Holland under their bridges, or in other places, made of clearly distinguishable bricks of a dark color. And there sometimes appears to those there, in the spaces between this brickwork, something bubbling or boiling out like a dark cloud, and this was boiling out in large bubbles. Then in the middle of the ceiling it was as if something was opening, but it was dark in color so that neither the sky, nor the daylight, was showing. Overhead toward the back part of the head, from the back side, some slight brightness like that made by torches appeared, which made its way in.<p>Such are the habitations of those who study the Word of the Lord without the purpose of understanding anything other than scholarly notes and words. I was sent among a society of this kind, when I was inspired to see these things, and I was told that ceilings like this, bubbling clouds, and a brightness at the back part, as described, appear to them. 1748, 22 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2380</h4><p>2380. CONCERNING THOSE WHO INHERE IN THE WORDS ONLY OF THE LORD'S WORD, AND ARE LITTLE SOLICITOUS ABOUT THE SENSE. <p>It was shown me that I was under a certain arched place; it was arched, or roofed [laqueare], as is the custom in Holland, or elsewhere, on the underside of their bridges [and was composed] of bricks [lateritis lapidibus] visibly distinct of an obscure color; and there at certain times appears to them as if this brickwork [lateritium] was interrupted, and there was something there full of bubbles [ballatum], or bubbling like an obscure cloud which bubbled up with great bubbles. Then in the midst of the roof was something opened as it were but of an obscure color, so that heaven was not visible, and therefore no day. Above the head, at the back part of the head, appeared at the back part something attenuated, as if it were luminous, which insinuated itself. Such are their habitations [domicilia] who study the Lord's Word, with no other end than to understand the critical observations and the words. Amidst such a society I was sent, when it was granted me to see these things, and I was told that such roofs [laquearia] bubblings of clouds, and luminous principle (at the back part) [aversa parte], appear to them. - 1748, June 22. </p>

De iis qui vocibus solum in Verbo Domini inhaerent, et parum solliciti sunt de sensu [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2380/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2356" target=_top>2356</a>]<p>Ostensum mihi est, quod essem sub quodam arcuato loco, arcuatum seu laqueare erat sicut solet esse <sup>1</sup></p><p>Hollandiae sub eorum pontibus, seu alibi, ex lateritiis lapidibus, visibiliter distinctis, coloris obscuri, et aliquoties ibi apparet iis quasi intermissum hoc lateritium, et ibi aliquid bullatum seu ebulliens sicut nubis obscurae, quae ebulliebat magnis bullis; tunc in medio laquearis erat quasi aperiendum aliquid, sed coloris obscuri, ut coelum non pateret, sic nec dies; supra caput a posteriore parte capitis, ab aversa parte, aliquid tenue quasi luminosum facibus <sup>2</sup></p><p>, apparebat, quod se insinuaret: talia sunt domicilia eorum, qui Verbo Domini student, absque fine ut intelligant aliud quam critica et voces; inter talem societatem missus sum, cum haec mihi videre dabatur, et mihi dicebatur, quod talia iis laquearia, nubium bullitiones, et luminosum aversa parte, appareant <sup>3</sup></p><p>. 1748, 22 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has esset<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
