<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2306</h4><p>2306. I have sometimes been surprised, as were the spirits also, when mental images of this kind occur, which are mere fantasies- and fantasies having the same effect on them as the senses themselves in the body. Not only do they seem to themselves to undergo pain and numerous other sensations, but they actually feel them, so that their fantasies have an effect felt as real or sensate. For this reason they could not understand why they could be called fantasies when they are really felt by the senses.<p>But it is a fact that their fantasies do have this real effect, because it is in their nature to believe them. But when they accept faith in the Lord, then they receive as a gift the ability to put them aside, and to be led to believe they are fantasies, so then they are removed by the Lord - not so before this, unless by some miraculous method. 1749, 12 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2306</h4><p>2306. I sometimes wondered, and spirits also, that such ideas as are mere phantasies, and the phantasies among them have the same effect which the senses have in the body, to wit, that they not only seem to themselves to suffer pains and very many things, but that they perceive them in reality, so that their phantasies have an effect, as it were, real or sensitive. Wherefore they could not know why these could be called phantasies, since they are perceived by the senses in reality. But it is the fact that their phantasies have so real an effect, inasmuch as they are of such a character as to believe it. But when they receive faith from the Lord, then they at the same time receive the gift or the faculty to be capable of being withdrawn [therefrom], and to be led to believe that these are phantasies; wherefore they are then removed (raised up) by the Lord. It is not so before, except in a certain miraculous manner. - 1748, June 12. <p>(THAT MEN AND SPIRITS MAY BE LED TO GOOD BY THE LORD, SO FAR AS THEY RECEIVE FROM THE LORD.) <p>(Many spirits complain that they are of such a character and cannot be different; wherefore they undergo vastations, and much besides [plura alia], in order that they may be such (as the Lord wills), and when the Lord has increased and added the things that are of true faith (they are such as He desires).) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2306 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2306. Miratus sum quandoque, et spiritus quoque, cum tales ideae sunt, quae merae phantasiae, et phantasiae apud eos, eum effectum habent, quem in corpore ipsi sensus, nempe quod non solum videantur sibi pati dolores, et perplura, sed quod actualiter sentiant ea, sic ut phantasiae eorum effectum habeant, ut realem, seu sensitivum; quare non potuerunt scire, cur ea phantasiae possent vocari, cum realiter ad sensum perciperentur: at ita se res habet, quod phantasiae eorum talem effectum realem habent, quia tales sunt, ut credant; at dum fidem a Domino, accipiunt, tunc simul accipiunt id donuu seu eam facultatem, ut <sup>1</sup></p><p>auferri possint, et iis induci credere, quod phantasiae sunt, quare tunc a Domino tolluntur; non ita prius, nisi modo quodam miraculoso. 1748, 12 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
