<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3741</h4><p>3741. About those who despise the Word and Divine worship, thinking it must be allowed only to hold people in bonds<p>There was a phalanx of spirits toward the front, rising up from the side of Gehenna, and on high coming forward. From their aura I sensed that they were debasing the Lord and extolling themselves, which I clearly sensed form the aura of their fantasies, which kept on spreading out. They were up above toward the front, and they operated by a wavy vibration, by which they also spoke, for speaking in waves was formerly often done, the undulation falling toward the left knee and extending toward the sole and beneath the sole of the foot, which symbolize the crudeness of their fantasies, while the knee [denotes] something more refined. The knee in front and the foot being bony, they are therefore spirits of the kind whose speech in vibratory waves falls there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3741</h4><p>3741. CONCERNING THOSE WHO DESPISE THE WORD AND DIVINE WORSHIP, AND THINK THEM TO BE ADMITTED SOLELY IN ORDER THAT MEN MAY BE KEPT IN BONDS.<p>There was a phalanx of spirits in front, rising from the side of Gehenna, and coming on high in front. It was perceived from their sphere that they made light of the Lord, and extolled themselves. This was manifestly perceived from the sphere of their phantasies, which was widely and continuously diffused. They were in an elevated position in front, and acted by an undulatory vibration, through which they also spoke, for to speak by [such an] undulation was formerly often done. The undulation fell towards the left knee, and extended itself to the sole, and under the sole of the foot, by which is signified the grossness of their phantasies, since the knee [denotes] that which is more subtle. The knee in front and the foot being bony, they are consequently such that the speech of those of this quality falls thither with a vibratory undulation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3741 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3741. De iis qui contemnunt Verbum et cultum divinum, et putant admittendum, ut teneantur homines in vinculis<p>Erat phalanx spirituum antrorsum, surgens a latere Gehennae, et in altum veniens antrorsum, ex sphaera eorum percipiebatur, quod vilem facerent Dominum, et se extollerent, quod ex sphaera eorum phantasiarum manifeste percipiebatur, quae diffusa, et continuabatur; ii erant superne antrorsum, et agebant per undulatoriam vibrationem, per quam etiam loquebantur, nam loqui per undulationem saepius prius factum, undulatio cadebat versus genu sinistrum, seque extendebat versus plantam et sub plantam pedis, qua significatur crassissimum eorum phantasiarum, cum genu id quod subtilius est, genu antrorsum et pes sunt ossea, qua re tales sunt, quorum loquela undulatorie vibratoria illuc cadit. </p>
