<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5769</h4><p>5769. Somewhere in the mountains and rocks where there were also good spirits mixed with evil ones, I also saw how they were separated: the good were in the middle, and taken together in a group they appeared to my eye as one person. Those who were outside it, all such as could not be received into the community of the good, were banished. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5769</h4><p>5769. I likewise saw at one place, in the mountains and rocks, where the good were also mingled with the evil, how they were separated. The good were in the midst and consociated together. When inspected by my eye, they appeared as one man. All who were outside him, were such as could not be received within the society of the good; and they were rejected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5769 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5769. Vidi etiam alicubi in montibus et petris, ubi etiam boni erant mixti malis, quomodo separati, boni in medio erant et simul consociati meo oculo inspecti apparebant sicut unus homo, qui extra illum erant, omnes tales qui non potuerunt recipi intra societatem bonorum, et rejecti sunt. </p>
