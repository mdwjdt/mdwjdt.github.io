<p>153.恶灵不断给人带来邪恶。我通过亲身经历数次获知，灵人绝不放弃向世人行恶，而是会顽固到底地坚持下去，以至于只要有机会，他们就粘附在某人身上许多天，事实上持续不断，无止无休。这一事实屡次向我清楚证明，因为他们给我身体的各个部位带来疼痛，这种疼痛有时在脚上，以致我几乎不能行走，有时在背部神经，痛得我几乎站不起来，结果摔了个跟头；在我的头部也一样。他们如此执拗地做这种事，以致疼痛和类似痛苦会持续很长时间，而且期间没有中断。我从与我交谈的恶灵那里清楚获知，这些痛苦就是他们带来的；因为与他们交谈期间，痛苦或缓解或加剧，事实上会突然间发生各种变化。从与他们的交谈和这些变化等等，我已经清楚知道他们来自何处。不过，详述这些经历实在冗长乏味。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 153</h4><p>153. About the persistence of evil spirits in bringing evil upon people<p>From experience I have learned several times that spirits do not ever abstain from, but very obstinately persist in doing evil to people on earth, so that whenever the opportunity offers itself to them, they cling to someone for many days, and indeed continuously, without interruption and without stopping. This fact was proven to me lucidly several times. For they brought on pains in various parts of my body - now in the feet, so that I could hardly walk, now in the dorsal nerves so that I could hardly stand up, but fell over; likewise in parts of my head. They did this so unyieldingly, that the pain and other effects lasted for quite a while, and without interruption.<p>That these things were brought on by evil spirits, I was taught plainly enough by the ones who spoke with me: for alternately, the pains were allayed and worsened - and really suddenly. From the conversation with them, and from the changes etc., it became quite clear to me [where they came from]. To recount the experiences in detail would be too much. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 153</h4><p>153. <sup>1</sup>CONCERNING THE PERTINACITY OF EVIL SPIRITS IN BRINGING EVIL UPON MEN <p>I have learned from experience at different times, that evil spirits in no wise desist from doing evil to man, but most pertinaciously persist, so that whenever the opportunity is afforded, they persist for many days, and indeed continually without ceasing. This was clearly shown me on several occasions by the fact that they brought pains to various parts of my body at times, in the feet so that I could scarcely walk, in the dorsal nerves, so that I could scarcely stand on my feet but stumbled, and likewise in parts of the head and this so pertinaciously that the pain and similar sufferings lasted continuously for quite a time. I have learned clearly from those who spoke with me that these pains were brought on by evil spirits; for during conversation with them the pains were eased and aggravated, and indeed suddenly with various changes, so this was sufficiently evident to me from the variation, etc. It would be tedious to relate the experiences. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For nos. 149-151, see after n, <a href="../se/205.htm">205</a>.

De pertinacia malorum spirituum afferendi hominibus malum<p>Ab experientia aliquoties didici, quod mali spiritus nequicquam desistant, sed pertinacissime inhaereant, ut faciant homini malum, adeo ut dum copia iis relinquitur, inhaerent per plures dies, et quidem continuo, nec desistunt, sicut mihi ostensum est liquido aliquoties, in eo quod dolores mihi inferrent variis corporis partibus, nunc pedibus, ut vix potuissem gradiri {a}, nervis dorsalibus, ut vix potuissem insistere plantis, quod labarim, similiter partibus capitis, tam pertinaciter, ut dolor et similia perdurarent satis diu et continuo, quae quod a malis spiritibus inferrentur, satis edoctus sum ab iis qui mecum loquuti sunt, nam dolores sedabantur et aggravabantur, et quidem subito, cum mutationibus variis; ex collocutione <sup>1</sup></p><p>cum iis, et ex variatione <sup>2</sup></p><p>, etc., satis id mihi constare potuit.
