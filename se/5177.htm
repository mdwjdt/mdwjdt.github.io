<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5177</h4><p>5177. About the reflections [of those] in the heavens, thus about the state of their life<p>It has surprised me greatly that spirits and angels reflect little on their state of life and how it differs from their state of life in the world, for example, on their homes, on their clothing, on how other things look inside their homes and outside their homes, etc., where these come from, what the source of changes [in them] is. They certainly know such things are produced by the Lord, nevertheless when they are produced they do not reflect [on this], or on the fact that when they think the opposite they disappear and that those who think the same are then suddenly present. The reason they do not reflect is because this follows along with their state of life, and when this follows from what is inward, thus as it were spontaneously, there is no state of reflection as there is with people who talk about, think about and discuss where something comes from.<p>Also, it has been observed that in the degree they do reflect on this [worldly aspect of life in the spiritual world], in the same degree innocence, wisdom, and understanding perish, and knowledge comes from these. And lest these abilities, which are essential, perish, they are held in a state where they do not reflect on them. But still their perception is maintained, apart from thought about what is going on and where it is coming from. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5177</h4><p>5177. CONCERNING REFLECTIONS IN THE HEAVENS, AND, THUS, CONCERNING THE STATE OF THE LIFE OF THOSE THERE.<p>I wondered exceedingly at the circumstance that spirits and angels reflect little upon the states of their life, as to wherein it differs from the state of life in the world; as, for example, about their houses, garments, the other appearances within and without the house, etc., as to whence these are and whence the changes [in them] arise. They know, indeed, that such things exist from the Divine; but, still, when they exist, they do not reflect upon them; thus, not upon the fact, that, when any are in an opposite opinion, they vanish, and that those are suddenly present who are in a similar opinion. The reason that they do not reflect, is, because all this is conformable to the state of their life; and, when this follows from the interior state, and thus, as it were, spontaneously, there is then no state of reflection, as there is with those who speak, think and deliberate as to whence and of what character a thing is. It was also observed, that, in the proportion in which they reflect thereupon, in the same proportion does their innocence, wisdom and intelligence perish; and, then, instead of these, knowledge obtains. Lest, also, those things perish which are the essentials, they are kept in a state of non-reflection upon them; but still they are kept in the perception, apart from knowledge, as to what and whence those things are. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;It seems desirable, here, to draw attention to the fact that the "reflection" spoken of in this number, is based upon externally acquired knowledges. Perception, on the contrary, is the spontaneous activity of the understanding proceeding from, and agreeing with, the will. While, therefore, the reflection spoken of having an altogether external basis, is radically an external act, perception, flowing as it does from the interiors of the mind, is radically an internal act. And it will be evident to everyone who even approximately understands the NEW-CHURCH psychology, that the exercise of the external mode of mental activity, called here reflection, is detrimental to, and, indeed, if carried far enough, destructive of, the internal, viz., perception. A careful study of the internal sense of the eating of the "tree of knowledge," in Eden, makes this matter quite plain. (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/204.htm">AC 204-209</a>.) ED. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5177 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5177. De reflexionibus in coelis, ita de statu vitae eorum<p>Hoc miratus maximopere quod spiritus et angeli parum reflectant super status vitae suae, in quo differt a statu vitae in mundo, prout super domus eorum, super vestes, super aspectus alios intra domus et extra domus, et reliqua, unde illa sunt, et unde mutationes; sciunt quidem talia existere a Divino, se usque quando existunt non reflectunt, ita nec super id, quod cum in opposita sententia sunt evanescant, et quod praesentes adsint subito qui in simili sententia; causa quod non reflectant, est quia hoc est secundum statum vitae eorum, et cum hoc sequitur ex interiori, ita quasi sua sponte, tunc reflexionis status nullus est, sicut qui loquuntur, qui cogitant, qui agunt, unde hoc et quale hoc. Observatum etiam est, quantum reflectunt super id, tantum innocentia, sapientia, et intelligentia pereant, et ex illis fiat scientia, et ne illa quae essentialia pereant, tenentur in statu non reflexionis super illa, sed usque tenentur in perceptione absque scientia, quid illa, et unde illa. </p>
