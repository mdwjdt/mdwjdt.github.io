<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1944</h4><p>1944. Permissions of evils by spirits are portrayed as a giving slack to their effort <sup>1</sup><p>In a spirit as in a person on earth, there is nothing but what is evil, with unlimited variety, depending upon the individuals. So they are constantly attempting evil, even though they may not realize it while they are being kept in restraint, depending on the tightness and the kind of their bonds. When evil spirits are permitted to do evil, therefore, this is done by giving slack to their effort, <sup>1</sup>and so it is portrayed. Thereupon they rush at once into thinking and doing what is evil, according to the character of each one. 1748, 12 May.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original has "of their efforts," but the index entries at Indoles, Malum, Proprium and Vinculum have "bond or effort." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1944</h4><p>1944. THAT THE PERMISSIONS OF EVILS FLOWING FROM SPIRITS ARE REPRESENTED BY A REMISSION OF THEIR EFFORTS. <p>In a spirit, as in a man, there is nothing but evil, with an indefinite variety according to subjects. Wherefore they are continually attempting evil, although they do not perceive it while they are held in bonds, and according to the strictness and quality of the bond. Wherefore, when it is permitted to evil spirits to do evil, it takes place by a remission of their endeavors; for such it is represented. They then immediately rush to the thinking and acting of evil, according to the natural genius of each one. - 1748, May 12. </p>

Quod permissiones malorum a spiritibus repraesententur per remissionem conatus {a} eorum<p>In spiritu sicut in homine, nihil est nisi malum, cum indefinita varietate secundum subjecta, quare continue conantur malum, tametsi non id percipiunt, dum in vinculis tenentur, et [hoc] secundum constrictionem et qualitatem vinculi; ideo cum permittitur malis spiritibus malum agere, fit id per remissionem conatus <sup>1</sup></p><p>{a} eorum, sic enim repraesentatur, illico tunc ruunt ad male cogitandum et agendum, secundum indolem cujusvis. 1748, 12 Maj.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has conatus </p>
