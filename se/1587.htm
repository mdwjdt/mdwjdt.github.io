<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1587</h4><p>1587. It is common, and it is proper to mankind, to speak with spirits and angels<p>Mankind was created to be able to speak with spirits and angels, so that earth and heaven may thus be joined together. In the most ancient Church this was so, in the ancient, and in the primitive [Christian] Church likewise they perceived the holy spirit. Such are the inhabitants of other planets, spoken of earlier [<a href="539.htm">539</a>, <a href="1424.htm">1424</a>]. For the human being is a human because of being a spirit, with the only distinction that the spirit of a person on earth is clothed about with a body for the purpose of functioning on earth.<p>That earth and heaven are now separated on this planet is due to the fact that humanity here has passed in the course of time to outer qualities, away from inner ones. 1748, 20 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1587</h4><p>1587. THAT THE PRIVILEGE OF CONVERSING WITH SPIRITS AND ANGELS MIGHT BE COMMON AND APPROPRIATE TO MAN. <p>Man was so created that he might hold interaction with spirits and angels, and thus heaven and earth be conjoined. Such was the case in the Most Ancient Church, such in the Ancient, and in the Primitive also there was a perception of the Holy Spirit. Such was the case with the inhabitants of other earths, concerning which I have spoken before; for man is man because he is a spirit, with this only difference, that the spirit of man on the earth is encompassed with a body on account of its functions in the world. That heaven and earth are now separated, as respects our planet, arises from the fact that the human race has here, in the process of time, passed from internals to externals. - 1748, March 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1587 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1587. Quod commune sit et hominis proprium, loqui cum spiritibus et angelis<p>Ita creatus est homo, ut loqui possit cum spiritibus et angelis, et sic ut terra et coelum conjuncta sint, tale fuit in antiquissima Ecclesia, tale in antiqua, in primitiva quoque percipiebant spiritum sanctum: tales sunt incolae aliarum tellurum, de quibus prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1587/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_539" target=_top>539</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1587/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1424" target=_top>1424</a>]; nam homo est homo quia spiritus, cum solo discrimine, quod spiritus hominis in terra sit circumindutus corpore, ob functiones ejus in terra, at quod separata <sup>1</sup></p><p>sint terra et coelum nunc in hac tellure, ex eo venit, quod humanum genus ad externa ab internis, successu temporis, hic progressum sit. 1748, 20 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has quot separati </p>
