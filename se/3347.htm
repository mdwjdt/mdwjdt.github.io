<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3347</h4><p>3347. But the inhabitants of Venus were examined, and they are indeed such as to delight exceedingly in plundering, so they obtain the pleasure of their life from that source. But still they are not cruel. Of course, they kill the people they plunder, but those whom they are able to save, they save. In fact they later bury those whom they cast into water and thus kill, so they also have something human within-differently from the Jews, to whom it was even delightful to throw those they had slaughtered to the wild animals and birds, to be devoured. I see some such now, they are Jews of today who take pleasure in such things. I received something out of the aura of some spirits hurrying up this way and fleeing away. 1748, 26 Sept. </p>

Sed Veneris incolae explorati, sunt quidem tales ut delectentur perquam ex rapinis, sic ut jucunditatem vitae suae inde acquirant; sed usque non sunt crudeles, interficiunt quidem homines, quos diripiunt, sed quos conservare possunt, conservant: imo postea quos projiciunt in aquas et sic interimunt, sepeliunt: ita quoque humanum intus in se habent; secus ac Judaei, quibus <sup>1</sup></p><p>etiam delectatio erat, projicere eos quos occiderunt feris et avibus, ut devorarentur; percipio tales nunc, sunt Judaei qui hodie, qui talibus delectantur, percepi aliquid ex sphaera aliquorum huc cito appellentium, et aufugientium. 1748, 26 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Judaei; quibus </p>
