<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4579</h4><p>4579. Hell<p>About those who in outer form, in tone of voice and outer gesture appear as if they are just and serious and therefore are in authority, many of whom hold positions of honor and yet are extremely wicked<p>There are some such as those just described, who sound the same in the other life, so that from their tone of voice and their outer aura they appear altogether good, and their aura influences the simple good. Consequently for a time they are able to be in the world of spirits, nevertheless loving their own kind. Those who act together with them and enlarge their honor and gain, and stick closely by them, those alone they treat well, but those who do not do so they harm in any way they can. They enjoy nothing sweeter than those people's punishments and torments, which they arrogantly carry on. These spirits harbor a hatred for all in the other [life], except for evil spirits, particularly those evil spirits who together with them torment others. They persist in tormenting others so stubbornly and feel so much enjoyment in it that it is incredible, and they would not stop to eternity. Finally I saw that they are thrust down into a hell toward the left side there at a distance, and there they are let down quite deeply, some of them very deeply, until they have no more hope of getting out. They are in a very thick cloud there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4579</h4><p>4579. HELL. CONCERNING SUCH AS, IN EXTERNAL FORM, SOUND OF SPEECH AND EXTERNAL GESTURE, APPEAR, AS IT WERE, JUST AND SERIOUS, AND SO [ARE] IN AUTHORITY, MANY OF WHOM ARE IN HONORABLE OFFICE, AND YET ARE THE MOST MALICIOUS.<p>In the other life are some such as have been already described, having similarly sounding voices, so that, from the sound of the speech, and from the external sphere, they appear altogether good, and their sphere is powerful among the simple good. Hence, they are able to be for a time in the world of spirits; but yet they are lovers of self, and only benefit those who act in the same manner as they do, promote their honor and gain, and adhere to them: those, however, who do not do so, they injure in every manner whatsoever, and feel nothing to be more sweet than their distresses and torments. They most obstinately persist in these practices. Such ones hate everybody in the other [life] except the evil, particularly those who at the same time torture others. So obstinately do they continue to torture others, and such delight do they find in it, that it is incredible; nor would they desist to eternity. At length, I saw that such spirits are thrust down into a hell, on the left hand side there, at a distance, and are there let down very deep, some of them exceedingly deep: yet, in order that they may not farther indulge the hope of emerging thence, they are in a very dense cloud there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4579 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4579. Infernum<p>De talibus qui externa forma, sono loquelae et externo gestu apparent sicut justi, et serii, sic in autoritate, quorum plures in dignitate sunt, et tamen malitiosissimi<p>Sunt tales quales jam descripti, in altera vita similiter sonantes, sic ut ex sono loquelae et sphaera externa appareant prorsus boni, et sphaera eorum apud bonos simplices valeat, inde possunt quoad tempus in mundo spirituum esse, sed usque amantes sui, qui cum illis idem agunt, promovent eorum honores, et lucra, et eis adhaerent, illis solum benefaciunt, at qui hoc non faciunt, illos quocunque modo laedunt, et nihil dulcius sentiunt, quam eorum supplicia et cruciatus, quibus etiam contumacissime insistunt, tales odio habent omnes in altera [vita], praeter malos, imprimis illos qui simul cruciant alios, tam contumaciter persistunt cruciare alios, et tam jucundum in eo percipiunt, ut incredibile sit, et in aeternum non desisterent: tandem vidi quod tales detrudantur in infernum ad latus sinistrum ibi ad distantiam, et ibi demittuntur admodum profunde, quidam eorum profundissime; usque ut non magis inde possint spem exeundi habere, in densissima ibi nube sunt. </p>
