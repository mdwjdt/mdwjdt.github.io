<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1054</h4><p>1054. Why some who are not angels are at times permitted to enter into heaven<p>Sometimes, and in fact quite often, evil spirits are permitted to slip cunningly into heaven, that is, into the company of angels - for this is being in heaven, since heaven is not a separate place but rather societies having a heavenly character and heavenly intelligence. Sometimes, and when angels of the inward heaven are in certain states of mind, evil spirits gain admittance by imitating goodness, and so putting on the appearance of being angels; for angels gladly let them in. But when they are discovered, which happens because of their disharmony, then they are cast out of heaven.<p>The reason for this is that also the angels are thereby tempted and tested as to whether they are as heavenly beings ought to be; for their dregs are ever clinging to them, and must in the course of time be put aside.<p>So the angels are led astray, and their blemishes exposed. Evil spirits are like a ferment that stirs up evil. If the angels then let themselves be misled, then they too are banished from heaven for a time, and undergo the appropriate kinds of chastening, after which they are again let in. So I have heard several times. 1748, 27 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1054</h4><p>1054. WHY CERTAIN SPIRITS, WHO ARE NOT ANGELS, ARE SOMETIMES PERMITTED TO ENTER HEAVEN <p>Sometimes, and indeed fairly often, it is permitted evil spirits by cunning to insinuate themselves into heaven, that is, into the company of angels, for thereby they are in heaven, for heaven is not a separate place, but societies that are of a heavenly genius and intelligence. During certain states of the angels of the interior heaven, evil spirits are sometimes admitted by means of imitations of goodness, and by putting on a pretence of being angels. The angels freely admit them. But when they are discovered, which comes about from their discordance, they are then cast out of heaven. The reason of this is that thus the angels also are tried and proved, whether they are of such a nature as heavenly beings ought to be; for impurities always adhere, and these must successively and in course of time be exterminated. Thus the angels are deceived and their blemishes laid bare. Evil spirits are like a ferment which stirs up evil into disturbances. If the angels then suffer themselves to be misled they also are banished from heaven for a time, and undergo a suitable kind of vastation, after which they are again admitted, as I have sometimes heard. 1748, Feb. 27. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1054 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1054. Cur in coelum quandoque permittantur quidam intrare, qui non angeli sunt<p>Quandoque, et quidem saepius permittitur, ut spiritus mali in coelum se astu insinuent, hoc est in consortium angelorum, nam ita in coelo sunt, non enim coelum est locus separatus, nisi quod societates sint coelesti genio et intelligentia; quandoque, et cum certi status angelorum interioris coeli sunt, per imitationes <sup>1</sup></p><p>boni, sic per induitionem speciosam, quod angeli sint, admittuntur, nam angeli libenter eos admittunt; sed cum detecti sunt, quod fit ex discordantia eorum, tunc ex coelo ejiciuntur; causa est, quod sic tententur et probentur quoque angeli, num tales sint, quales coelestes esse debent, semper enim faeculentum adhaeret, quod successive et tempore, exterminandum, sic angeli seducuntur, et propalantur eorum naevi, sunt mali spiritus tanquam fermentum, quod in turbas excitat malum; si tunc patiuntur se deduci <sup>2</sup></p><p>, tunc quoque ii aliquamdiu e coelo exterminantur, et subeunt vastationis species convenientes, et postea rursus intromittuntur, quae aliquoties audivi. 1748, 27 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has imitatationes<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
