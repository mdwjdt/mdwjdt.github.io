<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5272</h4><p>5272. I was brought down there when a visitation began. Then first they carried out an idol of Mary that was very holy to them, made of gold, dressed in the usual way. And then the Pope was brought out to another place toward the north, I don't know where. I realized that in his worldly life he had been blind. <sup>1</sup>Has he perhaps been saved?<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Perhaps Clement XII, Lorenzo Corsini, blind Pope (1730-40). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5272</h4><p>5272. I was conducted thither when a visitation was commencing; and, then, they first carried out a golden image of Mary, which they held most sacred, arrayed as is customary; and next the Pope was led forth to another place towards the north - whither, I know not. It was perceived that in the life in the world, he had been blind [I wonder] whether, perchance, he was saved? </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5272 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5272. Deductus sum illuc, cum visitatio incepit, et tunc primum exportabant idolum Mariae, quod illis sanctissimum, ex auro, vestitum ut solitum, et dein educebatur Papa in alium locum versus septentrionem, quo non scivi, perceptum quod in vita in mundo fuerit coecus; num forte ille salvatus. </p>
