<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5532</h4><p>5532. About the prior heaven and the last judgment<p>Priests in various places in the Protestant Christendom were visited, and those who can be called "dragons" were separated from those who were not. And up to several thousand dragons were found and were thrown out in groups into various hells, mostly in the west, nearer to and further away from the center. And when they were thrown out, an aura of filthy adulteries, varying depending on the forbidden degrees [of familial relationship], was noticed coming from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5532</h4><p>5532. ABOUT THE FORMER HEAVEN AND THE LAST JUDGMENT. <p>Visitation was made on priests in various places in Protestant Christendom, and those separated who can be called dragonists, from those who had not been. And the dragonists were found to amount to many thousands, and were cast out, by troops, into various hells, chiefly into the west, [both] nearer to, and farther from, the midst; and when they were cast out, a sphere of filthy adulteries, which were variously within the prohibited degrees, was perceived from then. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5532 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5532. De priore coelo et ultimo judicio<p>Visitati sunt sacerdotes in variis locis in Christianismo protestantium, et separati illi qui vocari possunt draconici ab illis qui non fuerunt, et draconici inventi sunt ad plura millia, et per cohortes ejecti sunt in varia inferna, maxime in occidente, propius et remotius a medio; et cum ejecti percepta est sphaera ex illis adulteriorum foedorum, quae intra gradus prohibitos varie. </p>
