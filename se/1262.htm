<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1262</h4><p>1262. After that confession, this punishment ensued, that he was twice rolled in the black ditch he had dug, thereby becoming a spirit as black in face and body as an Egyptian mummy. Then he was raised up high, flying around, exposed to the angels as the kind of person he had been and the devil that he was. On his approach to me I also felt that he was now cold, and was among the cold hellish spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1262</h4><p>1262. After that confession this punishment followed: he was twice rolled in that black hole which he had dug, and hence he became a spirit as black in face and body as an Egyptian mummy, and in this condition he was raised on high flying around, and it was made manifest before the angels what his quality had been, and what kind of a devil he was. I also felt as he came towards me that he was now cold, so that he is among the cold infernals. </p>

Post confessionem istam, haec punitio sequebatur, quod bis involutus esset atrae scrobi, quam effodit, et inde factus niger spiritus, sicut Aegyptii mumi, tam facie quam corpore, et sic sublatus in altum, circumvolitans, et coram angelis manifestatus, qualis fuerit, et qualis diabolus esset; sensi quoque adventum ejus ad me, quod nunc frigidus esset, sic inter infernales frigidos. </p>
