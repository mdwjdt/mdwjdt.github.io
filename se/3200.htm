<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3200</h4><p>3200. Evil preachers are even able to preach with conviction and false zeal<p>Again there was someone who had been let back into the state of zeal he had had in congregations, and spirits declared that the zeal was such that they could hardly stand it. What he was like was indicated to me by the foul smell of teeth. 1748, 19 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3200</h4><p>3200. THAT EVIL PREACHERS CAN ALSO PREACH WITH PERSUASION AND SPURIOUS ZEAL. <p>Again, there was one who [was] reduced into the state of zeal which we had in congregations; and spirits said that such was [his] zeal that they could scarce have endured it its quality was represented [significatus] to me by the offensive smell [faetorem] of the teeth. - 1748, September 19. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3200 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3200. Quod praedicatores mali etiam cum persuasione et zelo spurio possint praedicare<p>Iterum aliquis erat, qui reductus in statum zeli, quem habuit in concionibus, et dicebant spiritus quod talis esset zelus, ut vix potuissent sustinere, is mihi significatus qualis per footorem dentium. 1748, 19 Sept. </p>
