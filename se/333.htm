<p>333.死人的灵魂从尘世汲取肉体的性质。死人的灵魂从肉体汲取肉体的一切性质，甚至到了他们以为他们在肉体中，穿着衣服等等的地步；他们也有肉体的欲望，如食欲等等，以致肉体的性质被铭刻在灵魂上。他们保持他们从尘世和肉体汲取的性质；但随着时间推移，这一切可以说都会被遗忘，以致他们以为，他们已经完全脱去了它，尤其当他们成为天使之时；这是因为他们被赋予接受弥赛亚神的怜悯的能力。由于他们接受这种能力，他们以前的性质似乎从记忆中被抹除了；而事实上，它仍旧存留。因为如果弥赛亚神愿意收回祂的礼物，让天使回到他以前的生命，那么灵魂就完全和以前，就是离开肉体的时候一样。所以，可以告诉每个灵魂，他什么也没失去，也没有被夺走任何东西；不过，那时他们就成了野兽和魔鬼。（1747年12月11日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 333</h4><p>333. Souls of the dead carry with them from the world the character of the body<p>Souls of the dead carry with them from the body all of its characteristics - even to the point that they think they are in the body, dressed in clothes, and so on - and also its desires, such as an appetite for eating, and so on, so that the characteristics of the body are inscribed upon the souls.<p>The nature which they carry with them from the world and the body, they keep, but in the course of time it passes over into a kind of oblivion, so that they think they have put it off altogether, especially when they have become angels - this for the reason that they have been gifted with the ability to receive the mercy of God the Messiah. Then because of their accepting that ability, their former nature seems to be erased from memory, when nevertheless it remains.<p>For if it should please God the Messiah to take back His gift, and to place the angel back in his former life, then that soul becomes exactly as it had been before, when leaving the body - so every soul can be told that they lose nothing, and that nothing has been taken from them - but then they become wild animals and devils. 1747, the 11th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 333</h4><p>333. THAT THE SOULS OF THE DEAD DRAW WITH THEM FROM THE WORLD THE NATURE OF THE BODY <p>Souls of the dead draw with them from the body all its nature, so much so that they suppose that they are in the body, clothed with garments and similar things, and they have also its cupidities, as the appetite of eating, and the like; so that the things that are of the body are inscribed upon souls. They retain the nature which they draw with them from the world and the body; but in the course of time this is, as it were, given to oblivion, so that for the most part when they become angels, they suppose that they have entirely put it off, for the reason that they have been gifted with the faculty of receiving the mercy of God Messiah, and on account of that faculty which they have received, their former nature seems to have been obliterated. Nevertheless, it still remains, for if it should please God Messiah to take back His gift and return the angel to his former life, that soul would then become altogether as he was before, when he left the body. Thus it can be said to each single soul that he loses nothing, and that nothing has been taken away from him: but then they become wild beasts and devils. 1747, Dec. 11. </p>
