<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3744</h4><p>3744. I observed that while they were there, they would speak from there, and at the same time from near Gehenna, which surprised me, and I was told that they imagine they are on high there, whereas in fact they are near Gehenna, and that it is fantasy that they think they are on high, coming from their lofty-mindedness, which lifts them up there, when they are actually still near Gehenna, where their abode is. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3744</h4><p>3744. It was observed that when there they spoke thence, and at the same time as in the region of Gehenna, at which when I wondered it was said that they there think themselves to be on high, when in fact they are in the neighborhood of Gehenna, and that their thinking themselves to be on high was a phantasy, which proceeds from their lofty-mindedness, that elevates them thither, while yet they are near Gehenna, where their [proper] abode is. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3744 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3744. Observatum cum ibi essent, quod loquerentur inde, et simul loquerentur circa Gehennam, quod miratus, dictum mihi, quod putent se ibi in alto esse, cum tamen sint circa gehennam, et quod phantasia sit, quod putent se in alto esse, quae ex alto eorum animo venit, qui elevat eos illuc, sed usque quod sint prope Gehennam, ubi domicilium eorum. </p>
