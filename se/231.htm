<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>231.来世有来自悲伤和疯狂的快乐。我被允许看到这些女性灵人（230节）后，便在想象中看见一件非凡的事，即：当我在为来世竟有这种女人而感到伤心，因为我以为她们没有用处时，却有一种奇妙的代表持续了一段时间，表明以各种方式被调和的这种疯狂如何仍旧温柔而甜蜜地感染心灵。为叫我更好地觉察这一点，还出现了一种理解力的元素，可以说像是眼睛的某种东西；它正在观察，并将其视为纯粹的疯狂。但通过可以说奇妙的交织滚动，某种像花边一样的东西仍被表现出来，即它能被转化为某种表面美丽的东西。不过，理解力的眼睛阻止我沾染由此而来的任何乐趣，我也对此有所抱怨。还有一个人在看这些事物，并为我明显受似乎如此交织在一起的疯狂影响而感到愤慨。我意识到，如果理解力的元素不在那里，我可能早就被大大影响了，事实上被一种我之前从未以这种方式体验过的新快乐影响。因此，当我进一步思考来世那些不幸，可以说疯狂的灵魂会变成什么样，他们对于自己或他人有什么用时，因为若不以神国度中的功用为目的，弥赛亚神不会允许任何事发生，我最终意识到，由于这类灵人的流注，有一种快乐得以产生，这快乐类似流入纯真之人，并以奇妙的方式感染他们的快乐。当然，这一切是靠着神性全能，以便它们能被排列成如此奇妙关联的事物，好使由此而来的快乐能被交织在一起，感染被赐福的心灵，尤其感染小孩子，因而感染纯真的人。于是，因着弥赛亚神从疯狂，甚至从最悲伤和最不快乐的人那里的如此处理，欢喜和快乐的状态得以产生，并如同发芽那样生长，就像从地上的尘土中长出来的大量庄稼。我还被允许从弥赛亚神的天使那里清楚感觉到一种欢喜，即：甚至这类事物，也就是不幸福和不快乐本身也是有用的，加上这种希望：在这些女人当中，那些在属于信弥赛亚神的事上被启示的人还能从另一个可以说由对立物，或一双小小的理解力的眼睛构成的源头那里感知快乐。这些事物在某种程度上被如此描述出来，是为了属灵和属天事物的代表可在某种程度上被觉察到。（1747年10月29日凌晨）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 231</h4><p>231. From sadness and insanity, there are pleasures of intelligence in the other life<p>I saw an amazing thing in mental imagery, after having observed those female spirits [<a href="230.htm">230</a>], that is, when I was grieving at the existence of such in the other life whom I judged would be of no use. There was a remarkable symbolic display during an interval of some time, portraying how insanity, blended in various ways, would still gently and sweetly touch the mind.<p>So that I might perceive this better, there was also present an element of understanding, something like an eye, which was observing, and considered this as pure insanity. But by an amazing interweaving, so to speak, something was being portrayed all the while that resembled lace, meaning that it could be converted to something beautiful in appearance. But that eye of understanding prevented me from being touched by any pleasure, about which I complained, and indeed there was someone who was looking on these things, indignant that I was apparently being moved by insanities thus intertwined, and I realized that if that element of understanding had not been there, I could have been quite moved, and in fact by a new pleasure I had not experienced before in this way.<p>Therefore, while I was considering further what would become of those unhappy, seemingly insane souls in the other life, and what use they might be to themselves and others - because nothing is ever permitted by God the Messiah apart from the goal of use in His Kingdom - I finally realized that as a consequence of the influence of such souls as these, pleasures could be produced similar to those that flow into innocents and wonderfully affect them. It is of course through the Divine omnipotence that they are arranged like wonderful interlacing patterns of such a kind that from them, pleasures can be woven together and touch blessed minds, especially young children, and thus innocents.<p>So from insanities, even the saddest and most unpleasant ones, God the Messiah disposing, gladness and pleasures can be produced and grow as if by germinating, just like an abundant crop of standing corn out of the dust of the ground. I was also allowed to get from angels of God the Messiah the feeling of a kind of gladness, from the fact that even such states of actual unhappiness and unpleasantness could be useful, together with the hope that those among these women who are being enlightened in matters of belief in God the Messiah, might also be able to feel pleasures from a different source, composed of things opposite, or the little eyes of understanding. 1747, the 29th day of October (old calendar).<p>[Marginal Note: These things have been described to some extent, so that some kind of a portrayal of spirits and angels may be discerned.] </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 231</h4><p>231. IN THE OTHER LIFE THERE ARE DELIGHTS OF INTELLIGENCE FROM THE SAD AND THE INSANE <p>After it had been allowed me to observe those female spirits [n. <a href="../se/230.htm">230</a>, I saw in imagination a remarkable thing, namely, that I was grieved that there were such in the other life who, I supposed, would be of no use, but there was a wonderful representation, lasting for some time, showing how this insanity variously blended might nevertheless affect the mind gently and sweetly. In order that this might be the better perceived, there was also something intellectual, or as it were an intellectual eye, which observed and considered it as being something merely insane; but by a wonderful rolling together, as I might call it, there was still being represented something like lace, namely, something that could be converted into what was speciously beautiful; but that intellectual eye hindered me from being affected with a certain pleasure therefrom, of which I also complained. There was also a certain spirit who viewed these things with indignation, that I should, as it were, be affected by such seeming insanities thus woven together. And I perceived that if that intellectual had not been present, I could have been greatly affected, and indeed, by a new delight, which I had not experienced before in this way. When I further considered what would become of those unhappy, as it were, insane souls in the other life, and of what use they would be to themselves or others - for nothing is ever permitted by God Messiah without an end of use in His Kingdom - I at length perceived that from the influx of such spirits, delights could have been brought about similar to those which inflow into innocencies and affect them in a wonderful manner; and this, indeed, by Divine Omnipotence so that they may be disposed into such a wonderful connection of things as it were, that the delights therefrom can be woven together and affect blessed minds, especially infants, and thus innocencies. Consequently, from insanities, God Messiah so disposing, even from those that are most sad and in the highest degree undelightful, states of gladness and delight can be drawn forth, and as it were, made to germinate corn and the glad things of seedtime as if from the dust of the ground. It was also given me clearly to sensate a kind of gladness from the angels of God Messiah, that even such things, unhappy and undelightful in themselves, were of use, with the hope that such of those women who are enlightened in the things pertaining to faith in God Messiah, would also be able to perceive delights from another source, composed as it were of opposites, or little intellectual eyes. 1747, Oct. 29, o.s. in the morning. <p>mThese things are thus described to some extent in order that a representative of spiritual and celestial things may thence in some measure be perceived.n </p>

Quod ex tristitiis et insaniis jucunditates intelligentiae in altera vita<p>Mirabile mihi visum in imaginatione, postquam eas licuit observare [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_231/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_230" target=_top>230</a>], nempe quod dolerem, tales dari in altera vita, quas nullius usus fore arbitrabar, sed erat repraesentatio mirabilis per moram aliqualis temporis, quomodo insania varie permixta mentem usque leniter dulce afficeret, quod ut perciperetur eo melius, erat etiam intellectuale, seu quasi intellectualis oculus qui observabat autumabat id ut mere insanum, sed per mirabilem convolutionem ut ita dicam, repraesentabatur usque aliquid simile laciniae, quod nempe in aliquid speciose pulchrum converti potuisset, sed oculus iste intellectualis impediebat, quin inde voluptate quadam afficerer <sup>1</sup></p><p>, de quo etiam conquestus, et erat quidem qui aspectabat ea cum indignatione, quod tatibus quasi insaniis ita contextis quasi afficerer, et percipiebam, quod, si intellectuale id non affuisset, quod admodum affici potuerim <sup>2</sup></p><p>, et quidem nova jucunditate, quam prius non ita expertus; cum itaque amplius intenderim, quid ex infelicibus istis animabus quasi insaniis fieret in altera vita, et cui usui essent sibi ac aliis, quia nihil usque a Deo Messia permittitur, absque fine usus in Ipsius Regno, tandem percepi, quod ex similium influxu potuissent similes jucunditates effici, quae influant in innocentias, et eas mirabili modo afficiant, et quidem per Divinam omnipotentiam, ut disponantur in mirabiles tales quasi nexus rerum, ut jucunditates inde contexi queant, et mentes beatas cumprimis infantias, et sic innocentias afficere; ita ex insaniis etiam quae tristissimae sunt, et summe injucundae, laetitiae et jucunditates, disponente Deo Messia, deduci et quasi egermihare possunt, quasi ex pulvere humi, seges et sementis laeta; persentiscere mihi etiam dabatur species laetitiae, ab angelis Dei Messiae, quod talia in se infelicitates et injucunditates etiam essent utilitati, cum spe, quod earum illae, quae illuminantur in iis quae sunt fidei in Deum Messiam, etiam jucunditates aliunde, et quasi compositas ex oppositis seu intellectuatibus ocellis potuissent percipere. 1747, die 29 <sup>3</sup></p><p>Oct. st. v. mane.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
