<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2988</h4><p>2988. Conviction cannot be imparted except gradually in the course of time<p>Some of the inward spirits who had faith based on understanding complained that they cannot do otherwise, for in every detail they want to consult their reason, and consequently stick in doubt. But they received the reply that while something of conviction can be given to them so that doubt would not thus arise, to be given conviction in one state and in one moment is not sufficient. For when the state changes and at the next moment, they are as they were before.<p>So convictions are given by many confirmatory things and little by little, or gradually, thus imparted by the Lord according to an order, and according to the spirits' nature and character, so that it will take root, and then they are convinced, like the angels, and can be elevated into conviction by the Lord. For all states of conviction belong to the Lord. 1748, 29 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2988</h4><p>2988. THAT PERSUASION CANNOT BE INSINUATED SAVE AT INTERVALS [tractus] OF TIME AND BY DEGREES. <p>Certain of the interior spirits, who were of intellectual faith, complained that they cannot [be] different: for they wish to consult their reason with regard [ex] to such thing, and so stick in doubt: but it was replied to them, that there may indeed be given them something of persuasion, so that such [doubt] should not exist: but to give persuasion for one state, and one moment is not enough: for when the state is changed, and in the moment next succeeding, they were just as before. Wherefore persuasions are given by many confirming things, and gradually or by degrees. Thus it is insinuated by the Lord, according to order, and their nature and disposition, so as to take root, and thus they are persuaded like the angels, or elevated into persuasion by the Lord: for all states of persuasion are of the Lord. - 1748, August 23. </p>

Quod persuasio insinuari nequeat nisi per temporis tractus et gradus<p>Conquesti sunt quidam ex spiritibus interoribus, qui erant intellectualis fidei, quod non aliter possint, nam ex singulis consulere volunt suam rationem, et sic haerent in dubio <sup>1</sup></p><p>, sed iis responsum est, quod quidem iis dari possit aliquid persuasionis, sic ut non ita existeret [dubium], sed dare persuasionem non satis est, in uno statu et in uno momento, nam mutato statu, et momento mox sequenti tales sunt ut prius, quare persuasiones dantur a multis confirmantibus, et paullatim seu per gradus, ita insinuatur [persuasio] a Domino secundum ordinem et eorum naturam ac indolem, ut radicem figat, et sic persuasi sint, sicut angeli, seu in persuasionem elevari [possint] <sup>2</sup></p><p>, a Domino, nam persuasionis status omnes Domini sunt. 1748, 29 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has dubium<p>2.&nbsp;vide indicem ad Persuasio </p>
