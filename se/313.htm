<p>313.那些刚从肉身生活来到的灵人会获准进入更内层的天堂居所，却是以另外一种方式。与我说话的灵人也获准进入更内层的天堂，其中有一些我早就认识，他们几个月前才离世，也有一些是几年前离世的。这些灵人也获准进入更内层天堂的某些居所，好叫他们能在那里看见天堂的荣耀，凭感官感知它，同时听见天堂的荣耀。但他们还不能处于留在那里的状态，故被一种天使气场包围；该气场会除去一切纷争，以使那个居所的天使不会由此受到伤害，或被烦扰。（1747年12月6日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 313</h4><p>313. Those can be admitted into the very inward heaven's habitations who have recently come from the life of the body, but still in a different way<p>Some were also admitted into the very inward heaven, with whom I had spoken and whom I had known, who had deceased only several months before, and some a few years before. These also were admitted into certain habitations of the very inward heaven, that they might see heavenly glory there [cf. 268], and perceive it by sense, as well as hear it. But because they could not yet be in such a state that they could remain there, they were therefore encircled by an angelic field by which all discordance is taken away, so that the angels of that habitation could not be harmed or troubled thereby. 1747, the 6th day of December. </p>

THAT THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SO RECENTLY COME FROM THE LIFE OF THE BODY CAN ALSO BE ADMITTED INTO THE HABITATIONS OF THE MORE INTERIOR HEAVEN; BUT STILL IN ANOTHER MANNER <p>Some with whom I spoke were also admitted into the more interior heaven, and I knew some of them had been dead only a few months, and some a few years. These were also admitted into certain habitations of the more interior heaven, in order that they might there see and sensibly perceive, and at the same time hear the heavenly glory. But because they could not as yet be in that state so as to remain there, they were therefore encompassed by an angelic sphere by which all dissension was taken away, so that the angels of that habitation could not be hurt or disturbed thereby. 1747, Dec. 6. </p>
