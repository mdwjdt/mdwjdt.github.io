<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1206</h4><p>1206. Souls take off their clothes and make themselves naked when they consider themselves innocent<p>A certain spirit was being attacked by spirits of the urine, who like to attack everyone and anxiously look for a fault. Then on mere suspicion due to the company he is in, or some action in his present life, they at once judge and prejudge him, hoping to punish him by their own methods.<p>This is the first judgment [see <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>]. But when the soul considers himself to be innocent, he becomes angry, and he takes off his clothes even to complete nakedness, so they may do to him whatever they like. 1748, 7 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1206</h4><p>1206. THAT SOULS TAKE OFF THEIR GARMENTS AND MAKE THEMSELVES NAKED WHEN THEY SUPPOSE THEMSELVES TO BE INNOCENT <p>A certain spirit was infested by spirits of the urine who desire to infest all, and eagerly seek any occasion; and when they only suspect someone on account of his association, or because of some act of his present life, they at once judge, and prejudge him, and desire to punish him by their own methods. This is the first judgment. When, however, the soul thinks that he is innocent, he is angry and puts off his garments, and even makes himself naked, that they may do to him what they will. 1748, Mar. 7. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1206 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1206. Quod animae, subtrahant vestes, seque nudent, quando rbitrantur se innocentes esse<p>Quidam spiritus infestabatur <sup>1</sup></p><p>a spiritibus urinae, qui infestare cupiunt omnes, et quaerunt sollicite causam, dumque suspicantur modo ex consortio, aut quodam vitae praessntis actu, judicant illico, et praejudicant, et cupiunt punire suis modis, hoc est judicium primum [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1206/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1209" target=_top>1209</a>]; dum autem anima putat se innocentem esse, irascitur, et sibi exuit vestes, imo [se] nudat, ut faciant ei quodcunque velint. 1748, 7 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has spiritus, cum infestaretur </p>
