<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2271</h4><p>2271. About things to come<p>Angels do not know things to come, the Lord Alone knows them, and anyone to whom He sees fit to reveal them. Formerly I felt it as something to be abhorred when certain ones wanted to know things to come, for then some think they know whether that something is true or not, as people on earth are apt to do. But in the last times, for many reasons miracles do not take place, nor are things to come foretold. Just one reason I am permitted to bring forward, which is that the angels, in order to have happiness, must not know at all what the future holds, for the Lord looks ahead for them, what they may think at every moment. It is as the Lord said, that they should not be anxious about the future [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_34.htm">Matt. 6:34</a>]. Furthermore, knowledge of the future, which spirits are most eager to have, would involve very many things that would upset them, and upset order. Therefore it is also entirely contrary to the way spirits and angels are governed: they themselves should take nothing of what is their own, except what is permitted them. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2271</h4><p>2271. CONCERNING WHAT IS TO COME. <p>Angels do not know what is to come; the Lord alone knows, and he to whom He thinks worthy to reveal it. I first perceived something to be, as it were, execrated when certain desired to know what was to come, for thence some think to know whether [a thing] is true or not, as is the case with men on earth; but in the last times miracles do not occur, nor are things to come predicted, for many reasons: one only it is permitted to adduce, [namely] [that] the angels, in order that they may be in felicity, must not know in the least what is future, for the Lord looks out for them, what they think, every least moment. So the Lord has said that they were not anxious about the future. Moreover, the knowledge of the future, after which spirits long very much, would involve very many things that would disturb them, and order; wherefore also it is wholly opposed to the government [regimen] of spirits and angels, who must take nothing to themselves [ipsi for ipsis, I think] of their own, but what is permitted them. - 1748, June 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2271 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2271. De venturis<p>Angeli non sciunt ventura, Solus Dominus novit, et <sup>1</sup></p><p>cui revelare dignatur; prius percepi quoddam quasi detestandum, cum quidam cuperent ventura scire, inde enim quidam putant scire, num verum sit aut non, sicut homines solent in terra, sed ultimis temporibus miracula non fiunt, nec ventura praedicuntur, ex <sup>2</sup></p><p>causis multis; unam solum licet afferre: angeli, ut in felicitate sint, ne minimum scire debent quid futurum, nam Dominus iis prospicit, quid cogitent, quovis minimo momento; sicut Dominus dixit, ut non solliciti sint de futuro [Matth.VI: [34]; praeterea <sup>3</sup></p><p>futuri cognitio, cujus avidissimi sunt spiritus, involveret perplura, quae turbarent eos, et ordinem, quare quoque prorsus contra spirituum et angelorum regimen est, qui nihil debent ipsi depromere ex suo, praeter quod iis permittitur. 1748, 10 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has novit; et<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has praedicuntur; ex<p>3.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
