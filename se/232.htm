<p>232.对女巫的惩罚。我在睡梦中看见一个女巫利用巫术夺走真爱，从而使人变得软弱。当我醒来时，女巫出现了，因被认了出来而受到应有的惩罚。这惩罚如此可怕，以致我从未想到竟还有这样的惩罚。我被告知，天使只是调查一下她的犯罪行为，这种惩罚便出现了。她具有这样的性质，她会慢慢变成可怕的蛇或虫子，并且整个消失变成蛇或虫子。于是她在天使眼前消失了。（1747年11月3日）</p>

The punishment of witches<p>It appeared to me in sleep that some witch was using her witchcraft for the purpose of taking away true love, and thus of weakening a person. When I awoke, the witch appeared, who, being recognized, was handed over for due punishment. That punishment was horrible - I could never have imagined that such a punishment exists. I was told that it occurred when angels simply inquired into her wicked deeds. And in fact it was such that she gradually melted away into horrible snakes or worms, and wholly vanished into them. So she was cast out of sight. 1747, 3 November (old calendar). </p>

THE PUNISHMENT OF SORCERESSES <p>It appeared to me during sleep, that a certain sorceress was using her sorceries to take away true love, and thus to render a man weak. When I awoke the sorceress appeared, and having been recognized, was delivered over to the punishment due, which was so horrible that I could never have imagined that there could be such a punishment. It was said to me that there was that punishment only that the angels might inquire into her criminal deeds: and she was of such a nature that she was gradually dissolved into horrible serpents or snakes, and the whole woman went away into them and was thus rejected from the faces [of the angels]. 1747, Nov. 3, o.s. </p>
