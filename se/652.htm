<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 652</h4><p>652. Spirits have all these states, some the former, some the latter. When they are in the latter, life is felt more keenly than bodily life. One spirit told me he was in that state, and he could not tell in the least but that he was in conversation with others in his own room. In the same way, gardens and countless scenes depicting the pleasures of life are displayed. In this kind of life are angelic spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 652</h4><p>652. All these are states of spirits; with some it is the one, with some the other. When it is the latter, life is more sensitive than in the life of the body. A certain [spirit] told me that he was in such a state, nor could he ever know otherwise than that he was in conversation with others in his own chamber. So also gardens, and innumerable varieties of the delights of life are represented. In such a life are angelic spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 652 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>652. Omnes hi status sunt spirituum, quibusdam ille, quibusdam hic, dum hic, vita est sensibilior, quam vita corporis, dixit mihi quidam, quod in tali statu esset, nec usquam aliter scire potuerit <sup>1</sup></p><p>, ac si esset cum aliis in loquela,in suo conclavi, ita etiam horti et innumerae varietates jucunditatum vitae repraesentantur, in tali vita sunt spiritus angelici.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has poterit </p>
