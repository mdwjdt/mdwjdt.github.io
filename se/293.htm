<p>293.天使从内层天堂被转到更内层的天堂，那里有无人能表达的平安和喜乐。今天，从早晨直到中午，我都在那些原先在内层天堂，后蒙弥赛亚神怜悯，被转到更内层天堂的人中间，并与他们交谈。与他们的交谈能继续下去，不过要通过一个居间天使；该天使告诉我说，那时，可以说他成了媒介，好使谈话能从我传到他们那里。他们说，那里有喜乐和平安，是人在世俗生活中从未感受到丝毫的那种，并且还伴随着永恒的变化。为叫我能在某种程度上感受这种幸福，一位天使来到我这里。其他幸福的人围着这位天使，他们靠近我。然后，单单通过他们的靠近，快乐和幸福就如此穿透到我的至内在部分，正如他们所说，穿透我最深处的骨髓，以致我承受不住；因这至内在的喜乐，我几乎被融化了。（1747年12月4日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 293</h4><p>293. From the inward heaven, <sup>1</sup>angels are being transferred to the very inward heaven, where there is peace and joy such as no one can utter.<p>Today, from early morning until noon, I was among and spoke with those who had been in the inward heaven and had been transferred into the very inward heaven [cf. 265]. A conversation was able to be carried on with them, but through an intermediary angel, who told me this, namely, that he had now been made a sort of medium to establish communication from me to them.<p>They said that there was joy, and peace, such as a person could never feel even the least bit in mortal life, and which was eternally changing. In order that I might feel this happiness to some degree, an Angel came to me. Other happy ones surrounded the Angel, and they approached toward me, and then, only from its proximity, the joy and happiness so penetrated my innermost parts and, as they say, the deepest marrows, that I would not have been able to sustain it, without almost dissolving from innermost joy. 1747, the 4th day of December.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262, footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 293</h4><p>293. THAT ANGELS WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE INTERIOR HEAVEN INTO THE MORE INTERIOR HEAVEN WHERE THERE IS PEACE AND JOY SUCH AS NO ONE CAN EXPRESS <p>Today, from morning to noon, I have been amongst, and conversed with, those who had been in the interior heaven, who by the mercy of God Messiah were transferred into the more interior heaven; conversation could be carried on with them, but through a mediating angel who told me that he then became, as it were, the medium in order that the conversation might be communicated from me to them. They said that there was a joy and peace of which man in mortal life could never perceive even in the least measure, and this with eternal variety. In order that I might perceive this happiness in some measure, an angel came to me; other happy ones surrounded him, and approached me. Then from their approach alone joy and happiness so penetrated my inmosts - the inmost marrow, as they say - that I could not bear it, for thus I was as it were, dissolved from inmost joy. 1747, Dec. 4. </p>

Quod ab interiori coelo transferantur angeli in coelum intimius, ubi pax et gaudium est, quae nemo effari potest<p>Hodie mane usque ad meridiem interfui et loquutus sum cum iis qui in interiori coelo erant, qui ex misericordia Dei Messiae, in coelum intimius sunt translati, cum quibus communicari potuit sermo, sed per angelum mediantem, qui id mihi dicebat, nempe quod is factus est tunc quasi medius, ut communicari sermo ad eos a me posset, qui dicebant, quod gaudium esset, et <sup>1</sup></p><p>pax, quae homo nusquam in mortali vita percipere possit, ne minimum quidem, et hoc cum aeterna varietate; quam felicitatem ut aliquantum perciperem, ad me Angelus venit, circumdabant <sup>2</sup></p><p>Angelum felices alii, et appropinquabant ad me, tunc solum ex appropinquatione gaudium et felicitas ita penetrabat intima, ac ut ajunt, intimas medullas, ut non sustinere potuissem, nam sic ex gaudio intimo quasi solverer. 1747, die 4 Decemb.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has esset; et<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
