<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2354</h4><p>2354. About Balaam's blessing [the people]<p>It may strike one as remarkable that Balaam was able to curse the people, but that Jehovah did not hear him and he had to Bless them, just as we read in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_24_9.htm">Joshua 24:9</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_24_10.htm">10</a> - as if his curse, if it had come from him, could have accomplished anything!<p>But I can understand this matter somewhat from the state of the world of spirits, from the fact that very many are seeking out a reason to punish, and as soon as they find anything evil, anything of some consequence, they want that soul to be turned over to them, as I know from numerous experiences. They thoroughly search out whatever evil they can find, and when they find the evil, they claim for themselves jurisdiction over the person, and the punishing of the soul is indeed left to them. For when an evil is great, it has within it that it shall be punished. Accordingly, the Lord in the interest of justice permits that evil, and falsity, be punished, yet only for the sake of the person's betterment or welfare.<p>Therefore, since there was in the people Israel much that was wicked, idolatrous, and filthy, the Lord was not willing that such things should be discovered by Balaam, and that they should thus be indicted. For since it was true that they were of this nature, they would have been damned. This the Lord prevented, as He constantly does when newly arrived souls come and are charged. Balaam was able to speak with spirits, and was led by them, as his confession quite plainly reveals. 1748, 18 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2354</h4><p>2354. CONCERNING BALAAM, WHY HE PRONOUNCED A BLESSING. <p>It may happen [to appear] wonderful to anyone that Balaam could curse the people; but that Jehovah did not hearken to him, yea, also that he had to bless them, as is also read <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_24_9.htm">Joshua 24:9-10</a>, as if the cursing of the people [ejus] pronounced by him [he would have cursed them if thereby he] could have effected anything. But I am able to know, to some extent, from the state of the world of spirits, to wit, that very many of them seek a pretext for punishing; and as soon as they find aught of evil, that is of any moment, desire the soul to be delivered to them, as I know from many experiences. They anxiously search for whatever evil they can find, and when they find evil, claim the right over it; moreover, the soul is relinquished to them to be punished, for when the evil is great, then it is in the evil to be punished; wherefore the Lord, on account of justice, permits the evil and false to be punished, but only for the sake of its reformation or good. Since, therefore, there were such things in the people of Israel as were nefarious, idolatrous, and filthy, the Lord was unwilling that these should be detected by Balaam, and so be arraigned, for it was true that they were such; they would then have been condemned, which the Lord forbade, as continually is His custom, when souls recently [from the body] come [into the spiritual world] and are [there] arraigned. That Balaam could speak with spirits, and that he was led by them, is manifest enough from his confession. - 1748, June 18. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2354 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2354. De Bileamo, quod benedixit<p>Mirum cuivis obvenire potest, quod Bileamus potuit maledicere populo, sed quod non audivit Jehovah eum, sed debuit Benedicere, ut legitur etiam <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_24_9" target=_top>Jos. XXIV: 9-10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_24_10" target=_top>10</a>, quasi ejus maledictio, si ab eo, aliquid efficere potuisset! sed <sup>1</sup></p><p>scire id aliquatenus possum, a statu mundi spirituum, quod nempe perplurimi eorum quaerant causam puniendi, ac ut primum aliquid mali, quod alicujus momenti est, animam sibi tradi volunt, sicut a plurimis experientiis novi; inquirunt sollicite quicquid mali invenire possunt, et cum inveniunt malum, in eum jus sibi vindicant, iis quoque [jus] puniendi animam relinquitur, nam cum malum est magnum, tunc inest malo, ut puniatur, quare Dominus, ob justitiam, ut puniatur malum, et falsum, permittit, sed solum emendationis ejus seu boni gratia. Cum itaque in populo Israele talia fuerunt, quae facinorosa, idololatrica, et foeda, noluit Dominus, ut ea detegerentur a Bileamo, et sic accusarentur, nam verum erat, quod tales essent, tunc fuissent damnati, quod prohibuit Dominus, sicut solet jugiter, dum animae recentes veniunt et accusantur; quod Bileamus loqui potuit cum spiritibus, et quod ab iis duceretur, satis manifestum est ab ejus confessione. 1748, 18 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has potuisset: sed </p>
