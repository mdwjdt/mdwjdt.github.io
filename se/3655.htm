<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3655</h4><p>3655. About the raising up of those who had been spiritually dead<p>Once more I heard that some who were spiritually dead spoken of earlier [1092-1109, 3617], had been raised up, or introduced into life by the angels. With what pleasantness they did this I was afterwards made to feel, which was delicious, occupying my chest with delight. They also confessed that they seemed to themselves to be doing this from their own power, but that they know it was from the Lord. They are in charge of the left nipple of the breast, and they are chaste. 1748, 23 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3655</h4><p>3655. CONCERNING THE RESUSCITATION OF SOME WHO WERE SPIRITUALLY DEAD.<p>I again heard that some who were spiritually dead, and of whom mention has been made before were resuscitated, or initiated into life by angels. <sup>1</sup>The delight with which they did it was afterwards made perceptible to me, and the sensation was delicious, filling my breast with truly delicious [emotions]. They also confessed that they seemed to themselves to do it of themselves, but yet that they knew it was from the Lord. They preside over the left nipple of the breast, and are [or correspond to] the ribs. - 1748, October 23.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Referring to the case of those mentioned No. 3550-3556. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3655 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3655. De resuscitatis qui spiritualiter mortui<p>Iterum audivi quod qui spiritualiter mortui essent, de quibus prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3655/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3617" target=_top>3617</a>], resuscitati sint, seu initiati sint in vitam ab angelis; qua amaenitate illud fecerunt, mihi perceptum est postea, quae erat delitiosa, occupans pectus meum cum delitioso; confessi quoque, quod visi sibi facere illud ex se, sed quod sciant quod a Domino: praesunt sinistrae pectoris papillae, suntque castae. 1748, 13 Oct. </p>
