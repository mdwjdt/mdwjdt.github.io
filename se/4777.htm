<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4777</h4><p>4777. Next, I was shown in a hazy vision how this heavenly doctrine was advancing in Africa, namely, from there towards the interiors of Africa, although not to its center, and then turning to the inhabitants who are within Africa nearer to the Mediterranean Sea and continuing far in this direction, however, not to the coast; and then after a time turning back through the region, continuing inland all the way to Egypt, and in addition, going on from there to some peoples in Asia under the rule of the Turks, as well as in the surrounding region of Asia. The angels consequently rejoiced that the Lord's coming was now imminent, that the Church, which is now dying out in Europe, is being established in Africa and that this is being done by the Lord Alone through revelations and not through missionaries sent out from Christians.</p><p>[2] They were also warned that they should not accept any doctrine from Christian missionaries. They should certainly listen to them, but not believe them. On which account too, the heavenly doctrine is not being made known to those near the coast, because Christians who bring in offenses come there, for they are at the forefront of all who believe nothing and who live impiously. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4777</h4><p>4777. It was next shown, in an obscure vision, in what way that heavenly doctrine would advance in Africa, namely, from this place towards the interiors of Africa, but, still, not to the middle of it; and, then, should bend itself to the inhabitants who are in interior Africa, nearer to the Mediterranean Sea, and thus go on for a long distance, but not as far as to the coasts; and, then, after a time, should bend its way back through an interior tract as far as towards Egypt; and, also, should then proceed from there, to some in Asia under the government of the Turks, also in Asia round about. Hence, the angels rejoiced that the coming of the Lord was now at hand, and that the Church, which is now perishing in Europe, should be renewed in Africa; and that this is done by the Lord alone, by means of revelations, and not by missionaries from the Christians. The people in those countries were also cautioned not to receive any doctrine from Christian missionaries, but that they should indeed hear them, but not believe them. For which reason also, that heavenly doctrine is not divulged to those who are near the coasts, for Christians come thither and introduce scandals; for these surpass all in believing nothing, and living impiously. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4777 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4777. Deinde in obscura visione ostensum quomodo doctrina illa coelestis procederet in Africa, nempe inde versus interiora Africae, sed usque non ad medium ejus, et tunc flecteret se ad incolas qui intus in Africa propiores sunt ad mare mediterraneum, et sic pergeret in longum, sed usque non ad litora; et dein post tempus se reflecteret per tractum interius usque versus Aegyptum; et quoque inde dein ad aliquos in Asia sub imperio Turcarum, etiam in Asia circum. Inde laetificabantur angeli, quod adventus Domini nunc instaret, et quod Ecclesia, quae nunc perit in Europa, instauretur in Africa, et quod hoc fiat a Solo Domino per revelationes, et non per emissarios ex Christianis.<p>[2] Admonebantur etiam quod non reciperent aliquam doctrinam ex emissariis Christianis, sed quod quidem audirent illos, sed non illis crederent; quapropter etiam non divulgatur doctrina illa coelestis ad illos qui prope litora, nam illuc Christiani veniunt, qui scandala inferrent, nam ii sunt prae omnibus qui nihil credunt, et qui impie vivunt. </p>
