<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2397</h4><p>2397. Then it also explains why if people on earth merely scan with their eyes a volume they have written, only rapidly without reading, angels at once know whatever it contains and what the person's ideas had been in every detail. Consequently, if the person should read just one line, even if the words had been written many years before, they would know what his or her thoughts had been, where they had come from, what thoughts preceded them, and what followed - and this at a single glance. 1748, 23 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2397</h4><p>2397. Then it also [follows] hence, that if a man only runs over a volume with his eyes, and does not read what he has written, but slightly, they immediately know what it contains, and of what sort were his ideas about each thing; therefore if he should read even a single line, though written many years before, they know innumerable things, [as] of what quality his ideas have been, whence [they came] which precede [and] which follow; and this at a glance of the eye. - 1748, June 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2397 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2397. Tum etiam inde, quod si homo modo percurrit volumen oculis, quod scripsit, leviter solum, nec legat, quod illico sciant quid contineat, et quales ejus ideae fuerunt circa singula, proinde si vel unam lineam legeret, tametsi ante plures annos scripta, innumera scirent, quales ejus ideae fuerint, unde, quae antecedunt, et consequuntur, et hoc ictu oculi. 1748, 23 Junius. </p>
