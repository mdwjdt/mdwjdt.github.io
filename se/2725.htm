<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2725</h4><p>2725. About spirits who wanted to enter into the mysteries of faith by thinking, and to believe because of reasoned arguments<p>It happened very often that spirits wanted to enter by reasonings into the mysteries of faith, and not believe unless they mentally grasped that something could be so. I was inspired to tell them that they should still be believed even if we do not grasp them with the understanding, and that it was the wrong way around to want to believe because they understand, and this was shown in many ways. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2725</h4><p>2725. CONCERNING SPIRITS WHO WISHED TO ENTER BY THOUGHT INTO THE MYSTERIES OF FAITH AND TO BELIEVE FROM RATIOCINATIONS. <p>This often happened that spirits have wished to enter by ratiocinations into the mysteries of faith, and not to believe unless they have grasped by apprehension that it can be so - to these it was granted to say that we should believe, though we do not grasp by apprehension, and that to wish to believe, because they apprehend, is an inversion of order. This was shown in many ways. </p>
