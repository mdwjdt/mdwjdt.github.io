<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2512</h4><p>2512. then in a spiritual mental image, which is the same as an angelic one, it was granted me to see that nothing material can be in the use even though the use had formed the things, because all things down to the very least exist according to use. And since the formative use has nothing material in it, the spiritual mental image made it clear that it is the Divine that has formed them, and it is absurd to think it was something earthly, for what is earthly cannot be distinguished from what is material, i.e., heat, humidity, dew, rain, which are earthly. But in regard to use nothing earthly can be conceived of. 1748, 3 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2512</h4><p>2512. Then it was given me to see in spiritual idea, which is the same as angelic, that in use there can be nothing material: when yet use has formed these things because each and all things [are] according to use; and since there is nothing material in use, which, as it were, forms, it was apparent from the spiritual idea that the divine is that which has formed, and that it is absurd to think that the Natural [could have formed], for the Natural cannot be distinguished from the material; for instance, heat, moisture, dew, [and] rain, which are natural. But no such thing may [can] be conceived concerning use. - 1748, July 3. </p>
