<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2850</h4><p>2850. Human beings are guided in a wonderful way - they do not reflect on anything but what pertains to their state of mind<p>It was observed earlier [<a href="2843.htm">2843</a>] that unclean and evil spirits had paid attention to nothing else but dung, filth, intestines, because they are in such a state that they find their enjoyment therein, and whatever was round about, they did not see because they did not pay attention to those things, such as the houses and the many visual objects present. Consequently they saw things that were hidden from my eyes. In fact things at the side were so hidden that they could not be sensed except by their smell- which did happen.<p>From this it can be known that no matter what people are like, no matter in what state of mind and how their eyes move around, and no matter what they hear, or even say or think, still they do not pay attention to any other than those things which captivate their enjoyment and enthusiasm. The rest are like shadows, cast away, so to speak, far to the sides, so that they see and hear, and do not see and hear them. 1748, 18 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2850</h4><p>2850. THAT MAN IS WONDERFULLY LED, [AND] DOES NOT REFLECT UPON ANYTHING ELSE, BUT WHAT BELONGS TO HIS STATE, IN WHICH HE IS. <p>From those things, which have been previously observed, that unclean and evil spirits have reflected upon nothing else but excrements, filth, intestines, because they are in that state, that hence they derive their pleasantness [jucundum], and did not see whatever was round about, because they did not reflect thereupon, as upon the houses, and many objects which were present to the eye; consequently that they saw those things, which were concealed from my eyes, yea, so hidden, that the could not be perceived [sentiri] save by odor, [things] which [might be] one side [ad latus] as also was the case, hence may be known, that whatever the quality of man, and what his state, whatever be the manner in which his eyes are cast around, and no matter what he hears, yea, what he speaks and thinks, still he does not reflect upon [any] other things than such as his pleasantness [jucundum] and desire take up [aufert]. The rest are to him as shades, all as it were, rejected far to the sides, so that he sees and hears, and does not see and does not hear. - 1748, August 18. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2850 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2850. Quod homo mirabiliter ducatur, non reflectat super aliud quam quod status ejus est, in quo est <sup>1</sup></p><p>Ex iis, quae prius observata <sup>2</sup></p><p>[<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2850/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2843" target=_top>2843</a>]--quod <sup>3</sup></p><p>immundi et mali spiritus, super aliud nihil reflexerint, quam super excrementa, sordes, intestina, quia in statu eo sunt, ut inde jucundum eorum inveniant, et quicquid circumcirca erat, non viderent, quia non super ea reflecterent, ut super domos, et plura, quae objecta praesentia oculi erant, proinde quod viderent ea, quae abscondita ab oculis meis essent, imo quae ita abscondita, ut non nisi odore possent sentiri, quae ad latus, sicut quoque accidit--exinde <sup>4</sup></p><p>sciri potest, quod qualis {a} homo est, et in quo {b} statu est, et quomodocunque circummoventur oculi ejus, et quicquid audit, imo quae {c} loquitur et cogitat, usque super alia non reflectat, quam quae ejus jucundum et studium aufert, caetera ei quasi umbrae sunt, rejecta quasi ad latera longe, ut videat et audiat, et non videat et audiat. 1748, 18 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has est est<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
