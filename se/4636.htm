<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4636</h4><p>4636. About the Hell of those who are opposite the innermost quality of heavenly love<p>They are those who are opposite to those in the province of the womb in heaven, in which province those are who have the innermost quality of heavenly love. When they appear in the world of spirits, they are a little toward the front, quite high up and they are so malicious that they bring others to breathe as themselves and thus possess them. Their hell is toward the front, a little to the left, deep down. Their operation strives toward the womb. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4636</h4><p>4636. CONCERNING THE HELL OF THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE INMOST OF HEAVENLY LOVE.<p>There are those who are opposed to those who are in the province of the womb, in heaven, in which province are those who are in the inmost of heavenly love. When those appear in the world of spirits, they are a little in front, above, quite high; and they are in such wickedness, that they induce their respiration on others so that they may possess them. Their hell is in front, a little to the left, deep down. Their operation is directed towards the womb. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4636 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4636. De Inferno eorum qui oppositi intimo amoris coelestis<p>Sunt qui oppositi sunt illis, qui in provincia uteri in coelo sunt, in qua provincia sunt illi qui in intimo amoris coelestis, illi apparent cum in mundo spirituum, paulo antrorsum supra satis alte, et illi tali malitia sunt, ut suam respirationem aliis inducant, et sic possideant; infernum eorum est antrorsum paulo ad sinistrum, profunde; operatio eorum tendit versus uterum. </p>
