<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4517</h4><p>4517. Female magicians attach themselves to spontaneous mental imagery<p>The hair<p>Female magicians are intent upon nothing more than to captivate the minds of others and to attach themselves to them so as to cling to them, as they suppose, as happened with me in ways I cannot express, so numerous that they cannot be put in words, and would also be unbelievable. They enter into all parts of the skull and the body, and then search out which societies are aroused, which they attach in inexpressible ways, and to which they themselves are bound, entering also into the feelings in such a manner that they can scarcely be separated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4517</h4><p>4517. THAT WITCHES BIND OR FASTEN THEMSELVES TO IDEAS, AND ALSO TO THINGS SPONTANEOUS; WHAT THE HAIR IS.<p>Witches are intent upon nothing more than to captivate the minds of others, and bind themselves to them, in order that they may, as they suppose, cohere with them, which in my own case was effected by methods inexpressible and innumerable; were I to undertake to recite them, they would be deemed incredible. They enter into all parts of the cranium and the body, and thus inquire what societies are excited, which they bind, and are themselves bound to, in ineffable modes, especially by so entering into the affections that they can afterwards scarcely be separated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4517 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4517. Quod magae alligent se ideis, et spontaneis Crinis<p>Magae nihil magis student, quam aliorum animos captare, et se alligare iis, [quibus] ut putant, cohaereant, quod modis inexpressibilibus factum est mecum, qui modi tot sunt, ut non possint edici, incredibilia quoque forent, intrant in omnes partes cranii et corporis, et sic inquirunt quae societates excitantur, quas alligant modis inexpressibilibus, etiam alligantur, tum intrando in affectionibus, ut dein vix separari queant. </p>
