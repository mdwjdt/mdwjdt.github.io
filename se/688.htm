<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 688</h4><p>688. About horses that were seen<p>Many times I have seen horses, as well as horse-drawn carriages, and in fact, of various colors and various sizes, as mentioned previously [<a href="302.htm">302</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="632.htm">632</a>]. I have learned today that these stand for human erudition - in the good sense, intelligence, but in the bad sense, that erudition which distorts true intelligence.<p>And once earlier, I learned that one can also tell from the horse's position what it stands for. When the rear end of the horse is turned toward the face, then it symbolizes a distorted order and a distorted belief, brought on by learning - that is, when as a result of learning, people have become insane, or entirely stupid in spiritual matters, believing in nothing but what is earthly and worldly, and that they will die like animals, having no life remaining after their death. In this case their knowledge suffocates all understanding and belief regarding spiritual life. To such as these, the rear end of the horse is turned, indeed, they are cast into the horse. Although unwillingly, they are thrust inside, to their great distress and shame. 1748, 9 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 688</h4><p>688. CONCERNING HORSES SEEN <p>Horses, and chariots drawn by horses, of various colors and sizes have been seen by me many times (concerning which see above [nos. <a href="../se/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../se/560.htm">560</a>, <a href="../se/632.htm">632</a>), which, as I learnt today and once before, signify man's learning - in a good sense, intelligence, in a perverted sense, learning that inverts true intelligence. Further, from the position of the horse one can know what it signifies, namely, when the hinder part of a horse is turned towards the face it then signifies that an inverted order and inverted faith have been induced by learning, that is to say, that men have thereby become insane, or altogether stupid in spiritual things, so that they believe nothing but earthly and worldly things that they will die like the animals, and that no life will remain after death. Thus their sciences suffocate all understanding and faith concerning spiritual life. To such the hinder parts of the horse are turned; indeed, they are cast into the horse, although unwilling they are thrust in, which is done to their great worry and shame. 1748, Feb. 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 688 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>688. De Equis visis<p>Multoties mihi visi sunt equi, tum currus ab equis tracti, et quidem varii coloris, et variae magnitudinis, de quibus prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_688/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_302" target=_top>302</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_688/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_688/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_632" target=_top>632</a>], qui quod significent eruditionem hominis, in bono sensu intelligentiam, in pravo eruditionem quae invertit veram intelligentiam, didici hodie, et semel prius, quod etiam a positu equi scire liceat quid significet, nempe dum obvertitur pars equi posterior faciei, quod tunc inversus ordo, et inversa fides inducta sint per eruditionem, nempe quum inde facti sint insani, seu prorsus stupidi in spiritualibus, ut nihil credant praeter terrestria et mundana, [se] <sup>1</sup></p><p>morituros sicut animalia, nullam vitam post mortem mansuram, sic ut scientiae eorum suffocent omnem intellectum et fidem de <sup>2</sup></p><p>spirituali vita: talibus obvertitur equi pars posterior, imo conjiciuntur in equum tametsi invito, intruduntur, quod fit cum eorum magna molestia et pudore. 1748, 9 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
