<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 620</h4><p>620. Moreover, they who are governed by the Lord are passive, and have no powers from themselves, being incapable of doing and feeling anything from themselves, and they know this. mWith them there is only a passive force.n These are called "poor," and also "miserable," and are looked upon as such by others who think themselves strong. But those weak ones, who can do nothing from themselves, are governed by the Lord, He Himself taking care of them.<p>Those, however, who think that they live from themselves and govern themselves, are called "strong," and they possess active powers, while those just spoken of possess only passive powers. Those having active powers from themselves, are the ones who stir up evil thoughts and feelings in the others, so that the evils which they think and toward which they are urged are from the active powers of such spirits as inspire them. This was shown to me by a spiritual method today, and once before, so plainly that there can be no doubt of it. About these matters, I also spoke today with the spirits around me, who cannot but acknowledge it. 1748, the 1st day of February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 620</h4><p>620. Moreover, those who are governed by the Lord are passive, and have no power of themselves; they are impotent to act and feel anything of themselves, and they know it. With them there is only a passive force. These are called "poor" and also "needy" and they are so esteemed by those who suppose that they themselves are strong. Those weak ones who can do nothing of themselves are governed by the Lord. He Himself takes care of them. But, on the other hand, those who suppose that they live from themselves and govern themselves are called the "strong", and they possess active powers, whilst those just spoken of only passive powers. Those who possess active powers of themselves, are they who arouse evil thoughts and affections with the others; so that the evils which they think and to which they are aroused are from the active powers of such spirits who breathe forth like things. This was shown me in a spiritual manner today, and once before, so manifestly that there can be no doubt about it. I also spoke today with the spirits around me about this, and they could not but acknowledge it. 1748, Feb. 1. </p>

Praeterea, qui <sup>1</sup></p><p>a Domino reguntur, ii sunt passivi, et nullas habent vires a semet, sunt impotentes aliquid ex semet agendi, sentiendique, idque sciunt, hi vocantur "egeni," tum etiam "miseri," et ita existimantur ab aliis; qui se fortes esse putant, ii invalidi; qui nihil ex se possunt, a Domino reguntur, Ipse eorum curam habet. At vero ii qui putant se a se vivere, et semet regere, ii "fortes" dicuntur, et vires activas possident, cum illi, de quibus dictum, modo vires passivas, qui vires activas ex semet, ii sunt qui excitant cogitata et affectiones malas penes illos; sic ut mala quae cogitant, et ad quae excitantur, sint a viribus activis talium spirituum, qui aspirant similia, quod tam manifeste mihi per modum spiritualem hodie, et semel prius ostensum est, ut nihil de eo dubitari possit; de his etiam hodie loquutus sum cum spiritibus circum me, qui non possunt non agnoscere id. 1748, die 1 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ut et in J.F.I.
