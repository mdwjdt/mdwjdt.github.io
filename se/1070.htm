<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1070</h4><p>1070. About whoremongers who entice virgins to whoredom by tricks<p><p>There are some in the world who like nothing more than to entice virgins, wherever they are, as in convents, in families with their parents, or anywhere, and they slip into their favor by various methods of flattery, and entice them to whoredom, and thus take pleasure in variety. Such spirits belong to the province of the genital members, but they are outside of them.<p><p>As souls and spirits, they also have the same things in mind, as well as the ability to slip into groups. But when they have slipped in during the first period after the death of the body, because their thoughts are exposed they are then recognized; for such recognition follows them because the better spirits, and the angels, know.<p><p>Then they wander, and wherever they come they are refused, and if they have slipped in, they are expelled and penalized, for their allurements are treacherous. So finally, they are not let into any societies.<p><p>But these [punishments] are according to the different intentions, which are very numerous. Some deceive innocent girls and abandon them, taking pleasure in variety; then there are those who by similar slippery methods try to entice the wives of others away from their husband, thus breaking off marriage love. Therefore, the kinds and species of punishments are many and vary, and the time of being purged in solitary places, longer or shorter. 1748, 28 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1070</h4><p>1070. CONCERNING SCORTATORS WHO BY DECEIT ALLURE VIRGINS TO SCORTATIONS <p>Some men in the world desire nothing more than to allure virgins wherever they are, whether in monasteries, in families with their parents, or elsewhere, and by various ways and blandishments they insinuate themselves and entice them to scortation. Thus they are delighted with variety. Such spirits pertain to the province of the genital members but are outside of it. As souls and spirits, they have like things in mind and also the faculty of insinuating themselves into societies. But after they have insinuated themselves for the first time after the death of the body, they are then recognized because their thoughts are laid open. Such recognition also adheres for reasons which the better spirits and angels know. They then wander about, and wherever they go they are rejected; and if they have insinuated themselves they are expelled and punished, for their blandishments are deceitful. Thus, at length, they are admitted into no societies. These things take place according to the varieties of mind, which varieties are very many, as that they deceive innocent girls and abandon them, that they are delighted with varieties, also, that by their insinuations they likewise want to entice the wives of others away from their husbands and so disrupt conjugial love. Because of such varieties, the genera and species of punishments are many and varied, and the times of vastation in solitary places are longer or shorter. 1748, Feb. 28. </p>

De scortatoribus, qui virgines dolo ad scortationes alliciunt<p>Sunt quidam in mundo, qui nihil potius cupiunt, quam allicere virgines, ubicunque loci sunt, ut in monasteriis, in fammliis apud earum parentes, seu alibi, seque insinuant variis modis et blanditiis, et pellectant {a} eas ad scortandum, sicque delectantur varietate, tales spiritus ad provinciam membrorum genitalium pertinent, sed extra eos sunt; similia quoque in animo habent, ut animae et spiritus, tum eam facultatem, ut se societatibus insinuare queant, sed quia cogitata eorum patescunt, postquam se insinuaverint primo tempore post mortem corporis, dein sunt cogniti, quia cognitio talis adhaeret quoque, ex causis quod spiritus meliores <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et angeli id sciunt, tunc vagantur, et ubicunque veniunt rejiciuntur, sique se insinuaverint, expelluntur, et mulctantur, nam dolosae sunt blanditiae eorum, ita tandem in nullas societates admittuntur, sed quia haec se habent secundum varietates animorum quae perplures sunt-sicut <sup>2</sup></p><p>quod fallant innocentias, et exponant, ac delectentur varietatibus, tum etiam quod uxores aliorum similiter per insinuationes velint pellicere a marito, et sic amorem conjugialem rumpere-ideo <sup>3</sup></p><p>genera et species suppliciorum multae sunt et variae, ac tempora vastationis in solitudinibus diutiora aut breviora. 1748, 28 Febr.<p>a<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has sunt, sicut<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has rumpere, tunc (sic!) </p>
