<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5828</h4><p>5828. About those who believe in salvation by faith alone, they become heathen having no religion<p>The Dragon<p>Those who have convinced themselves about the doctrine of faith alone and have only become versed in the doctrine and committed nothing of what is true and good to life, because they entirely rejected moral life and good works, saying that these accomplish nothing, but that no evils are being imputed any longer because the Lord fulfilled the law, those again and again made a revolt, wanting to entirely destroy the heavenly doctrine, at the end to the point that they talk on scandalously about the Lord as regards His Human nature, saying that He was the same as they are and not better, and very many things that are unmentioned on account of the scandal.</p><p>[2] They were eventually examined, and it was found that they had committed nothing of Christian truth and goodness to their life. And then the doctrinal things that were merely factual knowledge and things in their memory were taken away from them, and thus they were left without them; and they appeared without clothing, for clothing stands for such things. And then they understood nothing at all, not even what is just and fair, and they were entirely like people who had no religion since they lived without religion. Those of them who were spirits were thrown into a certain dark, southern quagmire, where they are in darkness; and so </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5828</h4><p>5828. THOSE IN FAITH ALONE: THEY BECOME HEATHEN, OF NO RELIGION WHATEVER. THE DRAGON. <p>Those who have confirmed themselves in the doctrine of faith alone, and have cultivated only doctrine, and have enjoined nothing of the truth and good of life, since they have rejected all moral life and good works, saying that they avail nothing, but that no evils whatever are imputed, because the Lord fulfilled the law - these, again and again, became rebels, wishing to totally destroy heavenly doctrine to such a degree that they at length chattered blasphemies against the Lord as regards the Human, - that He was as they were and no better; and more things which they do not utter on account of the scandal. They were at length explored; and it was found that they have enjoined nothing of Christian truth and good of life. Then, doctrinals, which were only scientifics and matters of memory, were taken away from them; and they were thus left without them. They appeared, also, to be without clothes, because clothes signify such things; and then they understood nothing at all, not even justice or right, and were altogether like Gentiles who had no religion, inasmuch as they lived without religion. Those who have been their spirits, were cast into a certain gloomy gulf in the south, where they are in darkness, and were thus removed out of the world of spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5828 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5828. De illis qui in sola fide quod facti ethnici nullius religionis<p>Draco<p>Illi qui in doctrina de sola fide se comfirmaverunt, et modo doctrinam calluerunt, et nihil veri et boni vitae mandaverunt, quia rejecerunt vitam omnem moralem et bona opera, dicentes quod nihil faciant, sed quod omnia mala non imputentur magis, quia Dominus implevit legem, illi iterum et iterum rebelles facti sunt, volentes prorsus destruere doctrinam coelestem, usque tandem ut effutirent scandalosa contra Dominum quoad Humanum, quod esset sicut illi, et non melior, et plura quae tacentur propter scandalum; illi tandem explorati et inventi quod nihil veri et boni Christiani mandaverunt vitae, et tunc doctrinalia quae solum erant scientifica et res memoriae ablata eis sunt, et sic relicti absque illis, et apparebant absque vestibus, quia talia significant vestes, et tunc prorsus nihil intelligebant, ne quidem justum aut aequum, et erant prorsus sicut gentiles qui nullius religionis essent, quoniam vixerunt absque religione; qui eorum spiritus fuerunt conjecti sunt in voraginem quandam meridionalem obscuram, ubi in obscuro sunt, et sic e </p>
