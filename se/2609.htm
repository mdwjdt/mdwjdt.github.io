<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2609</h4><p>2609. Angels cannot have any idea at all of bodily things, words of language, names of countries, cities, and men, but of the realities they symbolize<p>By a spiritual mental image I clearly realized that angels can never have an idea of such things, for ideas of bodily things, of men, of names, of words, are so material and confined that they can never enter into heaven. Besides many more confirmatory points I will mention only this, which I saw clearly by that spiritual mental image: it is against everything rational that something merely material, such as also an idea of the meaning of the letter of the Word, can enter into spiritual regions, let alone heavenly ones. A camel may sooner pass through the eye of a needle [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_24.htm">Matt. 19:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_25.htm">Mark 10:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_25.htm">Luke 18:25</a>], and the whole terraqueous globe through a tiny hole that is not visible.<p>This was said to some who had boasted that they had been great on earth, supposing it was they who were meant in the sense of the letter, nor could they say anything in reply. 1748, 15 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2609</h4><p>2609. THAT ANGELS CAN BY NO MEANS HAVE AN IDEA OF CORPOREAL THINGS, THE WORDS OF LANGUAGES, THE NAMES OF LANDS, OF CITIES, AND MEN, BUT OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY SIGNIFY. <p>I have perceived plainly in spiritual idea that angels can never have an idea of such things; for the ideas [ideal, I think] of corporeals, of men, names, [and] words are so material and enclosed [conclusoe] that they can never enter into heaven. There are many other things beside which confirm [this], [to mention] only [this], it was plainly seen by spiritual idea, and that it is contrary to every rational [principle] that such [a principle] as is merely material, like the idea also the sense of the letter of the word can enter into spirituals, still less into celestials. Sooner [might] a camel [pass] through the eye of a needle, and the universal terraqueous globe through an invisible little orifice. This was said to certain who had boasted that they have been great in the world [in terris], supposing it is understood in the sense of the letter - and they could not answer anything. - 1748, July 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2609 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2609. Quod angeli nequaquam possint habere ideam corporeorum, vocum linguarum, nominum terrarum, urbium, et virorum, sed rerum, quas significant<p>Idea spirituali manifeste percepi, quod angeli nusquam habere possint ideam talium, nam ideae corporeorum, virorum, nominum, vocum, sunt ita materiales, et conclusae, ut nusquam intrare possint in coelum, praeter plura, quae confirmant, solum, quod idea spirituali manifeste visum, quod sit contra omne rationale, quod tale, quod mere materiale est, sicut idea quoque sensus literae Verbi, intrare possit in spiritualia, minus in coelestia, Camelus potius per foramen acus [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2609/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_24" target=_top>Matth.
