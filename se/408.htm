<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第408节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>408.关于那些受过教导，不愿承认弥赛亚神，被扔下去并被逐出天堂的人。几天来，灵人的天堂里有一些人在煽动骚乱，说服别人相信弥赛亚神不是中保，除此之外还说了其它由他们的幻想所引发的敌对言论。他们迷惑了许多人，由此导致一场叛乱，在叛乱中，一些灵人加入他们。这场叛乱持续了好几天，在此期间，弥赛亚神像以前一样在属灵的异象中可以说从我面前消失了，因此我被留在这些灵人的幻想中，他们只承认耶和华，弥赛亚神的父，因此认为没有一个中保。我被恩准通过属灵的异象看到这一切，想知道由此会发生什么。不久，我就听见并通过属灵的异象感觉，反叛的灵人感到疼痛，并且这帮灵人被赶了出去，正惨遭折磨，正如我现在从他们那里所听到的。哀哭声此起彼伏。正如他们所说的，有近万人在祈求，希望不再有人让自己受迷惑，除非他想遭受无法形容的折磨。从这一伙和类似的一帮人可以明白弥赛亚神论到一个没穿婚礼礼服就溜进筵席，然后被赶出去的人所说的话是什么意思（马太福音22:11-14]）。（1747年12月28日）<p>他们被扔进沼泽里去了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 408</h4><p>408. About some who had been instructed, and not wanting to recognize God the Messiah, were thrust down and cast out of heaven<p>For several days there had been some in the heaven of spirits who were stirring up trouble and persuading others that God the Messiah was not the mediator, besides other hostile sayings inspired by their fantasy. They had led many astray, thus causing a kind of rebellion, in which certain ones joined up with them. While this was going on for several days, God the Messiah, as He had been present before to my spiritual vision, seemed to have disappeared, and so I was abandoned to these spirits' fantasy of recognizing only Jehovah the Father of God the Messiah, without a mediator. All this I was granted to see by spiritual vision, wondering what would come of it.<p>Presently I heard, and sensed by spiritual vision, that the rebelling spirits had been seized with pain, and that that band had been cast out, and were being miserably tormented. This I am now hearing from them. There is much moaning and weeping. They number near the tens of thousands, as they declare, begging that no one let himself be misled again, if he does not want to suffer indescribable tortures.<p>This and a like gang is meant where God the Messiah speaks of one who slipped into the feast not clothed in a wedding garment, and was cast out from it [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_11.htm">Matt. 22:11-14</a>]. 1747, 28 Dec.<p>They were cast into a swamp. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 408</h4><p>408. CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED AND WERE UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD MESSIAH; THEY HAVE BEEN THROWN DOWN AND CAST OUT OF HEAVEN <p>For several days in the heaven of spirits there have been those who were exciting disturbances and persuading others that God Messiah was not the Mediator, besides other things which they interjected from phantasy, and they have seduced many. For this reason there arose a rebellion, as it were, certain spirits associating themselves with them. This rebellion lasted for some days, during which time God Messiah as He had been before in spiritual vision disappeared, as it were, from me, and thus I have been left to the phantasy of those spirits, who acknowledged only Jehovah, the Father of God Messiah, thus without a mediator, which it was granted me to perceive in spiritual vision. I wondered what would happen as a result. Presently I heard, and by spiritual vision sensed, that the rebels were seized with pain, and that that crowd was cast out and was being miserably tortured, as I now hear from them. There are lamentations upon lamentations. There are almost myriads, as they say, praying that no one should suffer himself to be seduced any more, unless he wants to undergo unspeakable torments. From this and a similar band it is understood what God Messiah says of the man who had also insinuated himself into the feast, not being clothed with a wedding garment, and who was cast out. [ <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_11.htm">Matt. xxii 11</a>.] 1747, Dec. 28. They have been cast into the lake. </p>
