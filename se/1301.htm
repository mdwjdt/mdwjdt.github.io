<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1301</h4><p>1301. He was seen by me in a naked human form down to the loins, which did not appear, but shined with a beautiful human radiance, nor did I manage to see his face. He was naked and shined with that radiance due to his own imagination, because he thought himself holy for having lived in that way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1301</h4><p>1301. He appeared to me in a human form of a beautiful human whiteness, naked down to the loins which did not appear. I did not happen to see his face. He was naked and of such a whiteness from his own phantasy, for he supposed that he was holy because he had so lived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1301 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1301. Is mihi visus in humana forma nuda, usque ad lumbos, qui non apparuerunt, sed candore pulchro humano, faciem nec ejus videre mihi contigit; nudus et tali candore, ex suamet phantasia, quia sanctum se putabat, quia ita vixit. </p>
