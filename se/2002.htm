<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2002</h4><p>2002. It is quite obvious that no particular can exist apart from something general, and that the particular is governed by the general, or each most individual detail by its own universal, which lays boundaries not only for the thought, but for the least elements of the thought.<p>It is thus a general field that moves and persuades anyone. Nor could anyone speak, and produce their feelings, if it were not for a universal thought-field governing and setting bounds on each and every particular. In this way, the individual words and ideas flow fittingly, as if of their own accord, as they are produced by that field in such a way that the person is unaware that they come from it. If there were not such a governing field, the person could not think and speak at all and with clarity in accordance with the character of the field. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2002</h4><p>2002. This is sufficiently manifest that there can never be given any particular without a general, and that the particular is governed by the general; so also the singular, and the most singular by its own universal, which not only assigns limits to thought, but even to the singulars of thought. Thus it is the common sphere which affects and which persuades. Neither can man speak, or bring forth his sensations, unless there be a certain universal sphere of thought which governs and limits all and singulars, so that each word or idea shall flow fitly and spontaneously as derived from that sphere, and yet in such a way that man shall not know whence their source. Unless such a sphere governed, man could by no means think or speak distinctly according to the state of the sphere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2002 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2002. Hoc satis manifestum est, quod nusquam dari queat aliquid particulare absque communi, et quod particulare regatur a communi, sic singulare, imo singularissima a suo universali, quod <sup>1</sup></p><p>terminos non solum cogitationi ponit, sed etiam singulis cogitationis; ita sphaera communis est quae afficit, et quae persuadet; homo nec loqui potest, et sensa sua depromere, nisi sit quaedam sphaera universalis cogitationum, quae regit, et limitat omnia et singula, ita voces singulae seu ideae fluunt convenienter quasi sponte, ut depromptae ab ea sphaera, ita ut homo nesciat, quod inde; nisi talis sphaera regeret, nequaquam homo cogitare, et loqui posset, et secundum sphaerae statum, distincte.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
