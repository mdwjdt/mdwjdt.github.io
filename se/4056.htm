<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4056</h4><p>4056. About one who named the devil<p>There was a spirit who was upright, but who, aroused by other spirits, on seeing something shameful would then say that it was uglier and more wicked than the devil, so that it had become a familiar expression with him to name the devil. When the spirits were displeased that he did this so often, he did restrain himself, but still spoke in that way. Therefore he was let into a veil, as if into a sack, where he became anxious. Then, set free, he came to me, and I felt the anxiety and fright this caused him, as he said that while he was in that veil, he lost hope of ever being able to get free. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4056</h4><p>4056. CONCERNING A CERTAIN PERSON WHO HAD CONTRACTED A HABIT OF NAMING THE DEVIL.<p>There was a certain spirit well disposed, but who, when he saw anything disagreeable or shameful [turpe,] was excited by other spirits, and said, that what he saw was more ugly and abominable than the Devil. Thus this form of speech, which consisted in naming the Devil, had become familiar to him. The spirits [with whom he was associated] were indignant that he should so frequently use this mode of expression, when he indeed restrained himself for a time, but still he continued to speak in this manner, wherefore he was let into the veil [a mode of punishment], as into a sack, where he suffered anxiety. When he was delivered, he came to me and I perceived the anxiety and terror which he had suffered; he told me that when he was in the veil, he despaired of ever being delivered. - 1748, November 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4056 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4056. De quodam qui diabolum nominabat<p>Erat spiritus probus, sed ab aliis spiritibus excitatus, cum videret aliquid turpe, tunc dixit, quod deformius et magis nefandum quam diabolus, sic ut formula ejus familiaris fuerit diabolum nominare, cum indignati spiritus, quod toties, se quidem coercebat, sed usque ita loquutus, quare in velum missus, sicut in saccum, et ibi in anxietatem, tum liberatus ad me venit, et percepi ejus anxietatem et terrorem inde, dicens, quod cum in velo isto, quod desperaret quod usquam liberari posset. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
