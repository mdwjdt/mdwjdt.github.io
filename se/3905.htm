<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3905</h4><p>3905. He was still in the gloomy darkness overhead, by which he had been so oppressed that it felt as if the weight of it was visibly moving my head forward, so that had I not been in bed, my head would have gravitated forward, and then back and forth. This gravitation was so strongly felt by me that it was like a superimposed weight pressing frontwards, but later to the sides, and around. This showed me what kind of flow that confusing darkness brings with it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3905</h4><p>3905. He still remained above the head in a dense obscurity, with which he was so oppressed that his weight was thence perceived, as it were, manifestly moving my head forwards, so that unless I had been in bed my head would have inclined in that direction and then to one side and the other. His gravitation, thus sensibly felt by me, was like that of a superincumbent weight pressing first in a front direction and then round about towards the sides; from which the inference was plain to me what kind of an influx is produced by that confused obscureness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3905 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3905. Erat usque in obscuro tenebroso, supra caput, quo ita gravatus erat, ut gravitas inde perciperetur quasi manifeste movere caput meum antrorsum, sic nisi in lecto, caput meum gravitaret antrorsum, et dein huc et illuc, gravitatio ejus ita mihi sentita, quae erat sicut incumbentis ponderis versus anteriora, at postea ad latera, circum; inde mihi constabat, quem influxum habet confusum obscurum. </p>
