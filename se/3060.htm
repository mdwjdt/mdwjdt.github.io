<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3060</h4><p>3060. By fantasies of others, spirits hardly know otherwise but that they are where they appear<p>When fantasies of others arouse other spirits, then it usually happens that he who is aroused by the other's fantasy hardly knows otherwise but that it is real, or that he is there, when yet it is not so. He is also allowed to realize this, sometimes very plainly, sometimes more vaguely, as even happened just now when others were aroused by those on high [<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>]: then those being aroused hardly knew whether they were there or not, but they were given to realize that it was the fantasy of those [on high].<p>It has also quite frequently happened to me that due to the fantasy of others, I would be among them, so that even they could not tell otherwise. I then led them as spirits along paths, appearing in many places at the same time, and when I, having found out that it was a fantasy, afterwards told them that I was in bed, then I saw myself as it were with them. This fantasy, however, very often came back to me, for what reason I do not yet know. 1748, 5 Sept.<p>It is not permitted the learned to speak with spirits except with peril of life<p>I spoke with spirits and was given to see by a spiritual mental image that it is highly dangerous for any scholar who is steeped in fantasies to be able to speak with spirits, or for any revelation to be presented to him, this for a multitude of reasons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3060</h4><p>3060. THAT THROUGH THE PHANTASIES OF OTHERS, SPIRITS SCARCELY KNOW OTHER THAN THAT THEY ARE [IN SUCH A PLACE] AS THEY ARE REPRESENTED. <p>When the phantasies of some excite others, then it usually happens that he who is excited by another's phantasy hardly knows other than that he is of such a character, or is there, when yet this is not the case, as is also granted him to perceive, sometimes more plainly, sometimes more obscurely. In like manner, it now also happened, when some were excited by those who were on high, then they who were excited scarcely knew whether or no [they were] there; but it was granted to perceive that it was their phantasy. It also several times happened to me, that from the phantasy of others I was amongst them; yea, so that they did not know other [than] that I led them, thus by ways like spirits, and presented them at the same time in many places. Inasmuch as I did not know that it was a phantasy, and afterwards told them that I am in bed; therefore, I, as it were, saw myself with them; which [phantasy] nevertheless often returned to me, from what cause I do not yet know. - 1748, September 5. <p>(THAT THE LEARNED OF THE WORLD ARE NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK WITH SPIRITS BUT AT THE PERIL OF LIFE.) <p>(I spoke with spirits, and it was granted to perceive in spiritual idea that it is most dangerous for any learned person, who is imbued with phantasies, to be able to speak with spirits, or any revelation disclosed to them, and this for many reasons.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3060 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3060. Quod per phantasias aliorum spiritus vix sciant aliter [quam] quod ita sint, ac sistuntur<p>Cum aliorum phantasiae excitant alios, tunc solet fieri, quod is qui ab alius phantasia excitetur, vix aliter sciat, quam quod talis sit, seu ibi sit, cum tamen non ita est, quod etiam percipere ei datur, quandoque manifestius quandoque obscurius, sicut etiam nunc contigit quoque: cum alii excitabantur ab iis qui in alto [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3060/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3058" target=_top>3058</a>], tunc ii qui excitabantur vix sciebant, annon ibi, sed dabatur percipere quod eorum phantasia esset; etiam saepe mihi contigit aliquoties, quod ex phantasia aliorum, essem inter eos, imo ita ut ii non aliter scirent, ducerem eos sic per vias sicut spiritus, sisterer multis in locis simul--cum <sup>1</sup></p><p>ego cum scirem, quod phantasia esset, dicerem postea iis quod in lecto sim, sic videbam quasi me apud eos; quae [phantasia] tamen saepius ad me redibat, ex quanam causa nondum scio. 1748, 5 Sept.<p>Quod doctis <sup>2</sup></p><p>loqui cum spiritibus non permittatur, nisi cum periculo vitae<p>Loquutus cum spiritibus, et idea spirituali percipere dabatur, quod periculosissimum sit, ut aliquis doctus, qui phantasiis imbutus, possit loqui cum spiritibus, aut ei aliqua revelatio sisti, et hoc ex multis causis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has simul; cum<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has docti </p>
