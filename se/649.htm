<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 649</h4><p>649. Man, who is an instrument, fallaciously thinks himself or herself to be the acting force in every single action<p>That human philosophy has [indeed] discovered many truths, is evident from the fact that people know that the acting force and the instrumental force work together as the cause [of something]. But this is where a fallacy arises, causing the human (who is only instrumental, or an instrument) to suppose that he or she is the acting force, because the accomplishing cause issues from the two forces combined. Because of this sense-deception, we ascribe to ourselves, the instrument, what belongs to the Lord, Who is the only acting force.<p>This was said to some in heaven, and they recognized it to be so and likewise the fact that a person may know many truths, yet know nothing whatever in the practice of them, the instrument still thinking itself to be the force. This results in a distorted order of life, causing the fantasies that so torture their souls. 1748, 5 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 649</h4><p>649. THAT MAN, WHO IS AN INSTRUMENT, SUPPOSES FROM FALLACY THAT HE IS THE FORCE THAT ACTS IN SINGLE THINGS <p>That human philosophy has discovered many truths can be confirmed from the fact that men know that the acting force, together with the instrumental force, make one cause. But the fallacy comes from this, that man, who is the instrumental force or the instrument, supposes that he is the acting force, because the effecting cause proceeds from both; hence it is from the fallacy of sense that he, who is the instrument, attributes to himself that which is the Lord's, Who alone is the One Who acts. This was said to those in heaven, and they acknowledged it. Thus it is that man knows many truths, but that he knows nothing whatever in their application; but the instrument still supposes that it is the force itself. Hence there exists a perverted order of life, and hence are the phantasies which torture their souls so much. 1748, Feb. 5. </p>

Quod homo qui est instrumentum, ex fallacia putet se esse vim agentem in singulis<p>Quod philosophia humana plures veritates habeat detectas, ex hinc constare potest, quod sciant, vim agentem cum vi instrumentali unam causam agere <sup>1</sup></p><p>, sed inde fallacia, quod homo qui est instrumentalis seu instrumentum putet [se] esse vim agentem, quia causa ab utraque efficiens prodit, inde fallaciae sensus, quod nempe tribuat sibi, qui est instrumentum, id quod est Domini, Qui Solus est agens; hoc dictum est iis qui in coelo, et agnoverunt, sic quoque quod homo sciat plures veritates, sed quod ne hilum sciat in applicatione, sed usque instrumentum putet se esse ipsam vim, inde perversus ordo vitae existit, et inde phantasiae, quae tantum animas eorum torquent. 1748, 5 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
