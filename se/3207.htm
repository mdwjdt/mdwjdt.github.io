<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3207</h4><p>3207. About the sirens of Gehenna<p>Some of them were with me, and they instructed me that they are hot, so it seems to them, but they are usually afire in their frenzy. So also, when they approach to the heavenly things of love, thus toward heaven, they become frigid, and as cold as snow and ice. The fires and ices can also waver from one extreme to the other, so that they are tortured miserably. 1748, 19 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3207</h4><p>3207. CONCERNING THE SIRENS OF GEHENNA. <p>(Certain of them were with me, and I was informed by them, that they are [not only] as it were hot, just as it seems to themselves, but are fiery, as is usual, in [their] frenzy. So also when they approach the celestial things of love, thus towards heaven, that they become cold, yea, as cold as snow and ice. They can [become] both fire and ice: thus [can undulate] from one extreme to the other, so that they are miserably tortured. - 1748, September 19.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3207 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3207. De sirenibus Gehennae<p>Quaedam earum apud me fuerunt, et instructus ab iis, quod sint sicut calidae ut sibi videntur, sed sunt igneae, ut solent in oestro; ita quoque cum accedunt ad coelestia amoris, ita versus coelum, quod frigidae fiant et ita frigidae sicut nives et glacies; possunt etiam ignes et glacies ita undulare ab uno extremo ad alterum, ut misere torqueantur. 1748, 19 Sept. </p>
