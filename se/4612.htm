<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4612</h4><p>4612. I observed spirits who were a little toward the left, at the level of the crown of the head, who were there secretly and who had taken away the inflow coming from angels. They were subtle, consequently they could do this. The things that were flowing in then appeared to be very harsh. But they were discovered and driven off toward the front where also they practiced the same thing. Afterwards they were cast into hell. They were refined, almost invisible, but wicked. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4612</h4><p>4612. (Spirits were observed a little to the left, in the plane of the crown of the head, who were there clandestinely, and who drew away the influx which came from the angels. They were subtle, so that they were able to do this. Then those things which inflowed, appeared very hard. But they were detected, and were driven away to the front. There, also, they practiced the same thing. Afterwards, they were cast into hell. They were subtle, of insignificant appearance, but malignant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4612 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4612. Observati sunt spiritus, qui fuerunt paulo ad sinistrum, ad planum verticis capitis, qui ibi clam erant, et qui abstulerunt influxum ab angelis, subtiles erant, ut hoc possunt, tunc apparebant illa quae influebant valde dura, sed deteg ebantur, et abigebantur antrorsum, ibi quoque exercebant idem, post conjecti in infernum; subtiles erant, inconspicui, sed maligni. </p>
