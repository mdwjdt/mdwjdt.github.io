<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3341</h4><p>3341. So with animals auras such as these prevail, but bodily and earthly ones. With people, however, there are not such auras, living as they do in fantasies. Otherwise they would also have not only these auras, which are the lowest ones, but would have the aura of recognizing a companion at once upon seeing him, what he is like as to natural inclinations toward him and others, then what he is like in life in common, what as to inner sense and reason, what as to all and the least of his inward qualities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3341</h4><p>3341. Wherefore spheres of such a sort prevail amongst them, yet [these] are corporeal and natural. But such spheres do not occur with man, because [he is] in phantasies. Man also [were it not for this], would not only possess such spheres, which are the lowest, but would have a sphere of recognizing [his] companion [fellow] [socium] as soon as he sees him, yea his quality, as regards natural inclinations against [towards] himself and others; also his quality in general life; his quality as to internal sense and reason, his quality as to earth and all his interiors. </p>
