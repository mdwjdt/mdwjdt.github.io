<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2927</h4><p>2927. Spirits, even if they had not been instructed during life appropriate to themselves all mankind's knowledge as if they had been instructed<p>[Take] only as an example, several times when I had done an arithmetic calculation in my head, as they say, then spirits were able to do this on their own - something well known to me from experience. Likewise with regard to other sciences, whatever they may be, if a person is practiced in them, a spirit possesses them as his own, even if he had learned nothing of them in life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2927</h4><p>2927. THAT SPIRITS, ALTHOUGH NOT INSTRUCTED DURING LIFE, APPROPRIATED TO THEMSELVES ALL THE SCIENCE OF MAN, AS IF THEY [HAD BEEN] INSTRUCTED. <p>(I will merely mention) for example [that] when sometimes I have made arithmetical calculations in [ex] the head, as it is said, then spirits could [do] it of themselves, as was made known by experience. In like manner as respects the other sciences, whatever they are, man is only expert by practice [callet] [but] a spirit possesses them as his own, although he may have heard nothing thereof in life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2927 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2927. Quod spiritus, tametsi in vita non instructi, omnes scientias hominis, sicut instructi, sibi adproprient<p>Solum in exemplum, cum calculaverim aliquoties arithmetice ex capite, ut dicitur, tunc spiritus poterant id ex semet, quod experientia notum factum, similiter quod attinet reliquas scientias, quaecunque sunt, modo homo callet, spiritus eas tanquam suas possidet, tametsi ab iis nihil audiverit in vita. </p>
