<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1910</h4><p>1910. The thoughts and actions of those who have faith are not theirs<p>Through much experience over some years, I have learned with certainty that the thoughts of those who have faith are not theirs. If evil, they belong to evil spirits, who believe that they are thinking on their own power, for which reason they are in fact accounted to them, as they are to people on earth who believe likewise. If good, they are of the Lord Alone. These facts I have been given to know with the greatest certainty by daily experience, over a long period of time. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1910</h4><p>1910. THAT THE THOUGHTS AND DEEDS OF MAN, WHICH ORIGINATE IN FAITH, ARE NOT HIS. <p>Through the abundant experience of many years, I have become most certainly assured that the thoughts of a man who is in faith are not his; but if evil, that they are the product of evil spirits, who believe that they think from themselves, and to them they are accordingly imputed, just as they are to men who cherish the same belief. On the other hand, if good, they are of the Lord alone. All this it is given me most assuredly to know, from daily and hourly experience and reflection. </p>
