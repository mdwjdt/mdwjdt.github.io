<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5578</h4><p>5578. About the writing of the heavenly angels<p>A page was shown to me on which something was written in Hebrew letters, and there was a certain spirit with me who said that the details there had meaning, not the literal meaning and not the internal or spiritual meaning, but the inmost meaning, which is the heavenly meaning. He saw this not from the words but from the individual letters and their bends, the curves or, as it is said, from the points and little horns. From this it was clear what every jot, point, and little horn of a word means, which things are [spoken about] in the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5578</h4><p>5578. ABOUT THE WRITINGS OF THE CELESTIAL ANGELS. <p>There was shown me a sheet of paper on which something was written in Hebrew characters; and there was a certain spirit with me who said what every detail there signified: not what the sense of the letter was, nor that the interior or spiritual sense, but what the inmost sense, which is the celestial. He did not see this from the words, but from the syllables and their inflections and curvatures; or, as is said, from the apices and little horns. <sup>1</sup>It was hence manifest what every jot, apex and little horn, <sup>1</sup>of which we read in the Word, signifies. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e. "jots, and tittle," - see note to no. 5562. -ED. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5578 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5578. De scriptura angelorum coelestium<p>Ostensa mihi est charta, ubi scriptum literis Hebraicis, et erat quidam spiritus apud me, qui dicebat quid singula ibi significarent, non quid sensus literae, nec quid sensus internus seu spiritualis, sed quid sensus intimus qui coelestis, hoc vidit non ex vocibus sed ex syllabis et earum flexionibus, curvationibus, seu ut dicitur ex apicibus et corniculis, inde patebat quid significat omnis jotha, apex et corniculum legis, de quibus in Verbo. </p>
