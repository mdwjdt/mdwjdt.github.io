<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>200.弥赛亚神的圣言的大量内在内容无法从现代人类的经验获知，但能从古人和灵人的经验获知。弥赛亚神的圣言中所出现的众多事物，无论旧约中的，还是新约中的，不能不令人费解。但这是因为生活在今天的人类已经完全不同于那些生活在古教会的人，也不同于那些后来生活在初代基督教会的人。这些人若活到现在，就能凭赋予他们的经验和启示清楚知道这一点；此外，通过观察现在充满天堂终端领域的灵人或人类灵魂的状态也能更好地了解这一点。正因如此，我被允许引用他们对如今几乎从人类记忆被抹除的那些事的经验，以这种方式来弥补这种无知。这些事是当着灵人的面写的，他们对于从他们身上获得经验感到气愤。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 200</h4><p>200. Much of the inward content of the Word of God the Messiah cannot be learned from the experience of the present human race, but from that of the ancient human race, and of spirits<p>One comes across very many things in the Word of God the Messiah, both in the Old and the New Testament, which cannot but appear as unintelligible. But this is because the human race living today has completely changed from the race that lived in the ancient Church, and afterwards in the earliest [Christian] Church. If they had been living today, they would have been able to know very well [what those things meant] from experience and by means of revelation [given] to them.<p>It can also be learned better by observing the condition of the spirits and human souls now filling up the lowest realm of the heavens. This is the reason why I am being permitted to bring in experiences from them, too, about things almost erased from human memory today, and in this way to make up for the ignorance.<p>These words [were written] in the presence of spirits, who became indignant that their experience was being taken, 1747, the 15th of September (old calendar), such as what is meant by being drunk, by blushing, and the like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 200</h4><p>200. THAT MANY OF THE INTERIOR THINGS OF THE WORD OF GOD MESSIAH CAN BE LEARNED, NOT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PRESENT HUMAN RACE, BUT FROM THAT OF THE ANCIENTS AND OF SPIRITS <p>Very many things occur in the Word of God Messiah, both in the Old and in the New Testament, which cannot but appear unintelligible, but this is because the human race living at this day has so entirely changed from those who lived in the Ancient Church, and from those who lived afterwards in the Primitive Church. These, if they were living now, would have been able to know this well from experience and revelation in themselves; moreover, it can also be better known from the state of the spirits or human souls who now fill the ultimate sphere of the heavens. This also is the reason why it is allowable to adduce from them experiences of things which at this day are obliterated, as it were, and in this way make good the ignorance. These things [were written] in the presence of spirits, who were indignant that experience should be gained from them. 1747. Sept. 15, o.s. As what is meant by being drunk, by blushing, and similar things. </p>
