For mankind is composed of nothing but offenses, see earlier [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/romans_9_32.htm">Rom. 9:32-33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-corinthians_1_23.htm">1 Cor. 1:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/galatians_5_11.htm">Gal. 5:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-peter_2_8.htm">1 Pet. 2:8</a>]. Therefore also He suffered, and was crucified, so that the offenses would remain, for no otherwise could such a continuous offense be rendered disconnected and mankind thus be saved by the implanting of knowledge and understanding, so that then the offenses would not appear. 1748, 26, 27 Sept. </p>

For man is composed of mere scandals [offences], see [what is said] previously [concerning this]. This scandal [was] as it were, nearly continual with the antediluvians; amongst their posterity after the flood, it was made by the Lord, as it were, a separate [discrete] [principle], which never could have happened unless scandals [offences] should remain with man; wherefore the Lord also became a scandal [an offence] to them, as the Word here and there [mentiones]; therefore did he also suffer and was crucified, that scandals might remain; otherwise never could such continued scandal be rendered separate [discrete], and thus man be saved by the implanting [insertion] of scientifics and intellectuals, so that thus scandals should not appear. - 1748, September 26, 27. </p>
