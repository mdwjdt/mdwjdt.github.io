<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5836</h4><p>5836. Continuation<p>I spoke with a certain woman who believed herself to be intelligent because she knew how to talk about some kinds of moral and civil matters as if she were intelligent. But it was perceived and said that this nevertheless was not her intelligence, because when she learned these things, she drew them from those whom she believed to be intelligent or also from books. Admiration for the intelligence [she drew] from these gave the idea that she too spoke from intelligence, but yet she was not. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5836</h4><p>5836. CONTINUATION. <p>I spoke with a certain woman who believed herself intelligent because she knew how to talk on certain moral and civil matters like an intelligent person. But it was perceived and said that still that was not from intelligence; because, when she learned these things, she imbibed them from those whom she thought intelligent, or even from books helpful to intelligence. From these she took up the idea that she also spoke them from intelligence; but still it was not so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5836 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5836. Continuatio<p>Loquutus cum quadam quae credebat se intelligentem esse, quia sciebat de moralibus et civilibus quibusdam rebus loqui sicut intelligens, sed perceptum et dictum quod hoc usque non esset ejus intelligentia, quia cum didicit illa, hausit ex illis quos credebat intelligentes, aut quoque ex libris, admiratio intelligentiae ex illis induxit ideam quod etiam illa loqueretur ex intelligentia, sed usque non erat. </p>
