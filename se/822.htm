<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 822</h4><p>822. That they likewise learn through other people who are not aware of this, is plain to me from many things that had happened to me before I spoke with spirits; and if I had reflected upon each incident at that time, I would have been quite certain about these facts, and able to assure everyone by experience alone.<p>Although this [instruction] is also accomplished by means of spirits, and a thousand other ways unknown to us, yet it should not be doubted that it is by the omnipotence of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 822</h4><p>822. That they are instructed in like manner by means of other men, although they do not know it, can be evident to me from many things that happened to me before I spoke with spirits; and if I had reflected upon the several occurrences at the time, I would have been sufficiently confirmed in them, and could have confirmed every one by experience alone. Although this is also effected in like manner by means of spirits, and by a thousand other ways unknown to us, it is not on that account to be doubted but that it is by the omnipotence of the Lord. </p>

Quod similiter per alios homines quamvis id ignorant id mihi patere potest a pluribus, quae mihi contigerant antequam loquutus sum cum spiritibus, sique reflecterem super singula tunc, in iis satis confirmarer, et confirmare <sup>1</sup></p><p>omnes possem, per solam experientiam; quamvis etiam similiter per spiritus, et per mille alios modos fiat, quae nobis non cognita sunt, ideo non dubitandum, quin omnipotentia Domini est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
