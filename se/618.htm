<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 618</h4><p>618. About the stench of intemperance<p>One evening when I had taken a lot of milk and bread, more than the spirits thought I needed, they kept their feelings fixed upon [the idea of] intemperance, of which they accused me. This caused an odor of human dung, coming from the solids, and a foul urinous smell from the liquids, to invade my nostrils. It persisted, and I was told that this happens to me because they hold their feelings fixed upon this kind of intemperance. They say that they smell no such stench themselves. 1748, 30 January and 1 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 618</h4><p>618. CONCERNING THE STENCH OF INTEMPERANCE <p>One evening when I had taken much milk and bread, more than the spirits deemed was good for me, they then held their senses upon intemperance with which they charged me. Hence there was in my nostrils the odor of human excrement from the dry foods, and a foul urinous odor from the liquids, which clung there; and it was said that this happened to me because they held their senses upon such intemperance. They said that they were not sensible of any like stench. 1748, Jan. 30 and Feb. 1. </p>

De foetore intemperantiae<p>Quum multum lactis et panis quadam vespera assumserim, et plus quam opinarentur spiritus mihi conducere, tunc tenebant suos sensus in intemperantia, cujus me redarguebant, inde odor stercoris humani ex siccis, et odor urinosi tetri ex liquidis, qui mihi in naribus erat, et haesit, et dicebatur mihi, quod id mihi fiat, quia sua sensa in intemperantia tali detinent: iis similis nidor non sentiri dicunt. 1748, 30 Jan. et 1 Febr. </p>
