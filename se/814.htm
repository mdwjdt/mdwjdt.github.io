<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 814</h4><p>814. About those who are allotted a place within the body<p>I was surprised that certain ones were allotted a place within the body, while others are outside. But I was instructed that they are allotted a place within the body who during their life had loved what is good, and had not hated anyone, but had put a good interpretation [on others' actions], desiring to do kindness to every individual and likewise, living in accordance with established order, thus showing heartfelt respect toward those who were in charge. 1748, 16 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 814</h4><p>814. CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE ALLOTTED A PLACE WITHIN THE BODY <p>I have been surprised that some are allotted a place within the Body, whereas others are outside. But I was instructed that those are allotted a place within the Body who during their life have loved that which is good; they have not hated anyone, but put a good interpretation upon everything, and desired to perform services in each single thing. At the same time also they have lived in subordination, so that they rendered honor from the heart to those who governed them. 1748, Feb. 16. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 814 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>814. Miratus sum quod quidam sortiti sint locum intra corpus, cum alii extra, sed instructus sum, quod ii intra corpus sortiantur locum, qui amarunt in vita id quod bonum est, nec odio habuerunt aliquem, sed in bonum interpretati sunt, et singulis officia praestare cupiverint, et simul qui in subordinatione vixerint, sic ut honorem praestiterint ex corde, iis qui imperarunt. 1748, 16 Febr. </p>
