<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2567</h4><p>2567. that they may be thought great by the world, and get rich. Therefore in that realm, which can be called the realm of intentions, being the inward realm of the world of spirits, there is so much insanity that it is almost replete with insanities. Thus is the iniquity of those who are called Christians come to fullness [cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_12.htm">Matt. 24:12</a>], so that now the kingdom of the Lord is being turned over to others, as foretold [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matt. 21:43</a>], otherwise the world would perish. For from that world of spirits it is known what the human race is like, and how corrupt it is, not so much from the outward world of spirits and from [newly arrived] souls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2567</h4><p>2567. In like manner, they who aim to grow wise from the sciences never [do so] for any other use than self in order to become great, and appear [so] in the world. Wherefore, in that sphere, which may be called the sphere of intentions, and is the interior [sphere] of the world of spirits, the insanity is such that [that world] is nearly overflowing with insanities: thus, the iniquity of those called Christians is consummated: wherefore the Lord's kingdom is now turned to others, as is predicted, otherwise the world would perish, for from the world of spirits is known the quality of the human race, and how perverted [the human race is] is not thus [known] from the exterior world of spirits and from souls. </p>
