<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 831</h4><p>831. Those spirits are above the head, quite high up - not directly overhead, but a little toward the front, very little. They are good spirits, and they, too, spoke with me, quite pleasantly; for they operate, even speak, with a very pleasant flowing motion. They said that they constantly aspire to come to heaven, for they are not aware that they had been in heaven, and then been removed so as to be better perfected, thus returning once again into heaven when the heterogeneous parts have been cast out from them.<p>The case is just as it is with that fluid in the ventricles, part of which is absorbed by the choroid plexus: part is expelled from them, part seeps elsewhere; part passes over into the third ventricle under the pineal gland and thus through the infundibulum toward the pituitary gland, where it is separated into three quantities, which are borne through various paths, canals and cavities, towards the jugular vein, going to meet the chyle coming up through the thoracic duct. Mingled together there, they are carried toward the heart, thence into the lungs, then back into the left ventricle [of the heart] and thus onward, part toward the head through the carotid arteries, part downward toward all the internal organs of the body.<p>All these events conspire to the purpose of forming the purer blood, or animate spirit, and thus the red blood, so that by a uniting of material and spiritual elements, they may bring about a harmonious life. 1748, the 18th day of February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 831</h4><p>831. Those spirits are above the head, rather high, not directly above the head, but a little, though very little, towards the front. They are good spirits. They also spoke with me quite pleasantly, for they act and speak by a very pleasant flow. They said that they continually aspire to enter heaven, not knowing that they have been in heaven and were removed therefrom, in order that they might again be better perfected. Thus when the heterogeneous parts have been cast out from them they return again into heaven, exactly as is the case with the serosity in the ventricles, of which a part, as being the part that is cast off, is absorbed by the choroid plexus, a part transpires elsewhere, a part passes into the third ventricle beneath the pineal gland, and thus through the infundibulum toward the pituitary gland, where it is separated in a three-fold manner, and the parts are afterwards carried by various passages, channels and sinuses towards the jugular vein, so that they may be at hand to meet the chyle coming up through the thoracic duct. There the two are consociated and carried toward the heart, thence into the lungs, and so back again into the left ventricle [of the heart], and so on; part is carried towards the head through the carotid arteries; part goes downward towards all the viscera of the body. All of this is to the end that the purer blood or animal spirit may be formed, and thus the red blood; namely, that material things united with spiritual things may effectuate their living a unanimous life. 1748, Feb. 18. </p>

Ii spiritus sunt supra caput, satis alte, non directe supra caput, sed paulo antrorsum, sed perparum, sunt spiritus boni, mecum quoque loquuti, satis amaene, nam per fluxionem satis amaenam agunt, etiam loquuntur; dixerunt, quod jugiter aspirent venire ad coelum, nesciunt enim quod in coelo fuerunt, et inde remoti, ut iterum melius perficiantur, sic redeunt iterum in coelum, quum partes heterogeneae ab iis ejectae <sup>1</sup></p><p>sunt, prorsus sicut se habet <sup>2</sup></p><p>serositas ista in ventriculis, cujus pars <sup>3</sup></p><p>absorbetur a plexu choroideo, sicut pars quoque inde exterminatur, pars aliunde transspirat, pars in ventriculum tertium sub glandula pineali transit, et sic per infundibulum versus glandulam pituitariam, ubi per tres modos separatur, et dein per varios meatus, canales, et sinus versus venam jugularem feruntur, ut obviam sistantur chylo subvenienti per ductum thoracicum, et ibi consocientur, et versus cor ferantur, inde in pulmones, et sic retro in sinistrum ventriculum, et sic porro, pars versus caput per carotides, pars deorsum versus omnia viscera corporis, omnia propter finem, ut purior sanguis seu spiritus animalis formetur, et sic sanguis ruber, nempe ut materialia unita spiritualibus efficiant, ut unanimam vitam agant. 1748, die 18 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>3.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
