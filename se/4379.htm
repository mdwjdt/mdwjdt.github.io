<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4379</h4><p>4379. How many evil spirits around me, examined by angels<p>When I awoke, I saw around me innumerable snakes together with vipers, some more distinctly, some more faintly, that were round about. They were evil spirits as examined by angels. On a different occasion, I had seen what a multitude of female evil spirits were around me, as wandering stars, almost innumerable, and that I was nevertheless protected by the Lord - which was also portrayed by a sky blue crosspiece composed of little bands, outside of which were evil spirits. 1749, 29 Aug. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Mars, meaning Tuesday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4379</h4><p>4379. WHAT A MULTITUDE OF EVIL SPIRITS AROUND ME WERE INSPECTED BY THE ANGELS.<p>Upon awaking I beheld around me an immense number of vipers and other serpents, some more distinctly, some more obscurely. These were evil spirits thus surrounding me, and they were inspected by angels. Evil spirits however in great numbers were seen around me under another aspect, viz., that of innumerable wandering stars; and yet that I was continually protected by the Lord, was represented by an azure colored barrier, composed of small cords interwoven together, on the outside of which the evil spirits were. - 1749, August 29. </p>

Quam multi mali spiritus circum me, inspecti ab angelis<p>Cum evigilatus, vidi circum me innumeros serpentes cum viperis, quosdam manifestius, quosdam tenuius, qui circumcirca erant, qui erant mali spiritus, inspecti ab angelis; alioquin visae mali spiritus quam multi circum me, per stellas errantes, quae paene innumerabiles, et quod usque a Domino tutatus, quod etiam repraesentatum per transtrum coeruleum ex fasciolis, extra quod mali spiritus erant. 1749, 29 Aug. </p>
