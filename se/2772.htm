<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2772</h4><p>2772. About those who strive only for the world and themselves<p>There are some, who have been discussed earlier [see <a href="2565.htm">2565-2575</a>], who inwardly think about and strive for nothing else but what regards themselves and the world, even though outwardly they do not appear to people to be doing so. About the aura of such people in the other life you may see what was said earlier [<a href="2740.htm">2740</a>]. How effectively it works in persuading was clear from when they convinced others that I was insane [<a href="2765.htm">2765</a>].<p>As to how they end up, this also was shown to me. They are brought down through the inward parts of the body, which they try and hope to occupy, for they also want to force their way into those pertaining to marriage love and destroy that love with others by their trickery. So they are let down by that route through the inward parts, but into the stomach, supposing it is by way of the heart, but their passage of descent is by way of the stomach. They think this route is through the province of the thighs, the regions of marriage love, but because the excremental provinces are also located there, they are brought down through these, finally beneath the right foot-sole, their dwelling place. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2772</h4><p>2772. CONCERNING THOSE THAT STRIVE ONLY FOR THE WORLD AND SELF. <p>There are [those] of whom [I have spoken] previously, who drink of, and strive from their interior, for nothing else, than what belongs to self and the world, although in externals they do not so appear to men. See above [what is stated] concerning the sphere of such in the other life. How efficaciously it acts for persuading was evident when they persuaded others that I was insane. In respect to their exit [exiutum], it is also shown me [that] they go down [deferunt] through the interiors of the body which they endeavor and desire to occupy; for they also desire to introduce themselves into those [interiors], which pertain to conjugial love, and with [penes] others, to destroy it by their artifices; wherefore they are let down by that way through the interiors, but not into the stomach. They feel as if [quod] [they were let down] by way of the heart; but [it is] through the stomach, and this way of descent. They suppose [they pass] through the province of the loins, where [are] the provinces of conjugial love; but inasmuch as there also are the excrementitious provinces (provinces of the excrements), they are let down through these. At last [they come] under the sole of the right foot, where their lodging [domicilium] [is]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2772 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2772. De iis qui soli mundo et sibi student<p>Sunt de quibus prius actum [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2772/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2565" target=_top>2565-2575</a>], qui nihil aliud cogitant et student ex interiori suo, quam quae sui sunt et mundi, tametsi in externis non ita apparent hominibus. De talium sphaera in altera vita prius videas [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2772/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2740" target=_top>2740</a>], quae quam efficaciter agit persuadendum, ex eo constitit, cum persuaserint aliis, quod insanus essem [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2772/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2765" target=_top>2765</a>]: quod eorum exitum attinet, mihi quoque ostensum est: deferuntur <sup>1</sup></p><p>per interiora corporis, quae occupare conantur et cupiunt, nam etiam ingerere se cupiunt in ea quae sunt amoris conjugialis, et eum penes alios destruere, suis artificiis, quare per viam istam demissi sunt per interiora, sed in ventriculum, sentientes quod per viam cordis, sed per ventriculum est sic via descensus, putantes per provinciam lumborum, ubi provinciae amoris conjugialis, sed quia ibi sunt quoque provinciae excrementosae, per eas deferuntur, tandem sub plantam pedis dextri, ubi eorum domicilium.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has deferunt </p>
