<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5038</h4><p>5038. This was shown by a portrayal, as happens in the other life. A certain individual appeared above with a knife and scissors (knif och sax <sup>1</sup>). The knife pictured and symbolized the good of civic life and the scissors (sax) the truth of civic life. When those who were in that great city looked at those things, those who were evil were then delighted and liked them, saying that what they saw was ingenious, clever, and practical. By this was symbolized that those who adulterate goods and truths gain recognition, are loved, and are raised to high positions and wealth on account of such things. I observed that the knife and scissors were so effective that they could penetrate to a person's most inward elements. This was a sign that they could adulterate goods and also truths entirely, to such an extent that it was impossible to resist. Those who were better, however, were not delighted and did not love them, some due to the fact that they were not skilled at adulterating goods and truths, some due to the fact that while they knew how, they did not want to do it, so for a variety of reasons.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for ԫnife and scissors" </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5038</h4><p>5038. This was shown by means of a representative as is customary in the other life. There appeared a certain one above, with a knife and scissors (knif och sax). The knife represents and signifies the good of civil life, and the scissors (sax) the truth of civil life. Then the evil who were in that great city, when they beheld these things, rejoiced, and were delighted with them, and also called it ingenious, clever and prudent; and by this was signified, that those who adulterate goods and truths are applauded for such things, and are loved and promoted to honors and profit. It was observed that the knife and scissors had such efficacy as to be able to penetrate to man's inmosts; which was a proof, that they can completely adulterate goods and also truths, even to such a degree that it is impossible to resist. But those who are of the better sort did not rejoice, or care about the matter; some, because they were not skilled in adulterating goods and truths; others knew how but were unwilling to practice it: thus, for every variety of reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5038 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5038. Hoc ostensum est per repraesentativum, sicut fit in altera vita, apparuit supra quidam cum cultro et forcipe <sup>1</sup></p><p>(knif och sax <sup>1</sup></p><p>) culter repraesentat et significat bonum vitae civilis, et forceps (sax) verum vitae civilis; qui in magna urbe illa erant, cum inspicerent illa, tunc mali gaudebant, et amabant illa, et quoque vocabant ingeniosum, solers, et prudens, per quod significabatur, quod qui adulterant bona et vera pro talibus agnoscantur, amentur, et promoveantur ad honores, et ad lucra: observatum quod talis efficacia cultri et forcipis esset, ut posset penetrare ad intima hominis; quod indicium erat, quod bona possint prorsus adulterare et quoque vera, usque adeo, ut impossibile sit resistere: qui autem meliores erant, illi non gaudebant nec amabant, quidam ex eo quod non calluerint bona et vera adulterare, quidam quod sciverint, sed noluerint exercere; ita cum omni varietate.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;intellexerim forfice </p>
