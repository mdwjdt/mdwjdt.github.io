<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2949</h4><p>2949. This can also be illustrated by every movement of thought and speech. Human beings think analytically, or according to the deepest secrets of analytical philosophy, and still do not know them. So also do they speak and act, but when they reach out to learn how a matter stands, thus thinking, speaking and acting according to knowledge, then they turn themselves away from those deepest secrets, which guide, and they fence themselves in. And insofar as such knowledge is present and rules, so far they become insane and stupid; insofar as that most secret guidance [is present and rules], and not self, so far they possess the faculty of understanding and are able to be moved by those [deepest secrets]. 1748, 27 Aug.<p>This was corroborated further by the [action of] muscles. When one is acting voluntarily, if one knows which muscles are acting, and which tissues, and focuses the mind on the muscle and tissue, thus trying to command it to act, while one is concentrating on it the muscle cannot act; if one stops, it acts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2949</h4><p>2949. It may also be illustrated by every point [memento] of thought and speech. Man thinks and speaks analytically, or according to all the most recondite [arcanissima] things of analytic philosophy, and yet does not know it, that thus he speaks and acts. But when he aims to know how the matter is, and so thinks [speaks and acts] according to knowledge [scientia], he then averts himself from most recondite things, which lead him, and circumscribes [finit] himself: and so far as these things are present and rule, so far does he become insane and stupid. So far as he [is conducted] by a most recondite leading [ductu], and not by himself so far is he in the faculty of understanding, and in a state of being affected according to these things. - 1748, August 27. This was still further confirmed by the muscles. When man acts from will, if he knows what muscles and what fibers act, and directs his mind to muscle and fiber, so that he wishes so to command it, when he intends [an act], then the muscle cannot act; if he remits [his efforts] it acts. </p>

Quod quoque illustrari potest ab unoquovis momento cogitationis et loquelae: homo cogitat analytice, seu secundum omnia arcanissima philosophiae analyticae, et usque non novit, ita quoque loquitur et aait, at dum intendit scire quomodo se habet, et sic secundum scientiam cogitat, loquitur et agit, tunc avertit se ab arcanissimis, quae ducunt, seque finit, et quantum ex iis adest et regit, tantum insanit et stupidus fit, quantum a ductu arcanissimo, et non a semet, tantum est in facultate intelligendi, et in statu affici secundum ea, 1748, 27 Aug., quod <sup>1</sup></p><p>confirmatum adhuc per musculos: dum ex voluntate agit, si homo novit quinam musculi agunt <sup>2</sup></p><p>, et quaenam fibrae, et intendit mentem in musculum et fibram, ut imperare sic ei velit agere, dum intendit, tunc musculus agere nequit, si remittit agit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Aug: quod<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
