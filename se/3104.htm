<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3104</h4><p>3104. Another reason why a spirit does not know otherwise than that he is a person on earth, even though he does not see through the person's eyes nor hear through their ears, is that he at once puts on everything belonging to their memory as his own, and whoever puts on a person's memory also puts on the person: for one is not a person by virtue of the body, but of the inward qualities. That they have put on my memory, completely, is evident to me from many experiences. But they do not take possession of the inward memory-this the angels of the Lord possess, who rule those spirits who are below, just as those who are with the inhabitants of Jupiter [see <a href="542.htm">542</a>], where two are around the head and rule the punishing spirit, who does not know but that he is acting and speaking on his own. If a person has reached the point where his inward memory is ruled by evil spirits of the inward world of spirits, something that is not permitted, then the person can no longer live. 1748, 8 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3104</h4><p>3104. The reason that a spirit does not know other than that he is the man, although he does not see through the man's [ejus] eyes, and hear through his ears, is, that he immediately puts on everything which belongs to men's memory, as if his own: and he who puts on the memory of a man, also [puts on] the man: for man is not constituted a man by his body, but by his interiors. To me, it is evident from many experiences, that they have entirely put on my memory. But they do not possess the interior memory: that [is possessed] by the angels of the Lord who rule [direct] those spirits, who are below just as they [who are] with the inhabitants of Jupiter, where are two around [about] the head, and rule [direct] the chastising spirit, who does not know other than that he acts and speaks from himself. When man reaches that point, that his interior memory is directed [ruled] by interior evil spirits of the world of spirits, a thing never permitted, then can man no longer live. - 1748, September 8. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3104 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3104. Quod spiritus non aliter sciat quam quod homo, tametsi non videt per oculos ejus et audiat per aures ejus, in causa [etiam] est, quod omnia quae sunt memoriae hominis illico induat, sicut sua, et qui induit memoriam hominis, is quoque hominem, nam homo non est homo, qua corpus, sed qua interiora ejus; quod memoriam meam induerint, prorsus, multis experientiis mihi constat; sed interiorem memoriam non possident, eam angeli Domini, qui regunt spiritus istos, qui infra sunt, sicut ii apud Jovis incolas [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3104/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_542" target=_top>542</a>], ubi duo circum caput, et regunt spiritum castigatorem, qui nec scit aliter quam quod is ex se agat et loquatur; cum eoousque homo pervenit, ut interior memoria regatur a spiritibus interioris mundi spirituum malis, quod nusquam permittitur, tunc homo non amplius potest vivere. 1748, 8 Sept. </p>
