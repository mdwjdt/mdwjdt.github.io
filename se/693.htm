<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 693</h4><p>693. All and the least occurrences in the other life are aimed toward a joining together through love<p>Whatever happens in the other life, such as punishments, purgings, and many more things, all and the very least tend toward the goal of developing societies [whose members] harmonize as if they were one person, and this takes place only through a love for the Lord and thus for one's companions.<p>This love is never achieved when one person wants to be greater than the other, which results in disunion and rejection, nor when one wants to stand out above the others in some respect. On the contrary, it is achieved when one wants to be the least, and to serve the rest. Thus when all mutually want to serve one another, they are united, and each receives happiness from everyone individually, and thus from the whole. These words were spoken in the presence of spirits and souls. 1748, the 9th day of February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 693</h4><p>693. THAT EACH AND ALL OF THE THINGS IN THE OTHER LIFE ARE DIRECTED TO CONJUNCTION BY LOVE <p>Whatever happens in the other life, such as the punishments, vastations, and very many other things, each and all tend to the end that societies which concord like one man can be reformed, which is effected solely by the love of the Lord, and thus of one's companions. This love can by no means be obtained when one desires to be greater than another - whence come disunion and rejection - nor when one desires to be supereminent in anything, but [only] when he wants to be the least, and to serve the others. Thus when all want to serve each other mutually, they are united, and each has his felicity from the individual and thus from the general. These things were spoken in the presence of spirits and souls. 1748, Feb. 9. </p>

Quod omnia et singula in altera vita dirigantur ad conjunctionem per amorem<p>Quicquid usquam fit in altera vita, sicut punitiones, vastationes, et perplura, tendunt omnia et singula ad finem, ut societates formari queant, quae concordent sicut unus homo, quod unice per amorem Domini, et sic sociorum fit; qui amor neutiquam obtinetur, quando unus altero major cupiat esse-inde <sup>1</sup></p><p>disunio, et rejectio-nec <sup>2</sup></p><p>in aliqua supereminere, sed ut minimus esset velit, et servire reliqui ita dum omnes sibi mutuo servire volunt, uniuntur, et unusquisque felicitatem habet ex singulis, et sic ex communi haec loquuta in praesentia spirituum et animarum. 1748 die 9 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has esse, inde<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has rejectio nec </p>
