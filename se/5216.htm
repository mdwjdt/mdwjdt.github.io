<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5216</h4><p>5216. Their situation was this: those who are more remote govern those who are in the front, consequently the cardinals were further away. They flowed into the lowest parts of my left foot because they were more sensual than the rest. The inmost evils of that religion flowed into my testicles and brought a certain pain to their interiors, a sign that they are totally against the inner things of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5216</h4><p>5216. Their situation was this. The more remote ones ruled those who were towards the front, consequently, the cardinals were the more distant. They inflowed into the lowest parts of the left foot, because they were more sensual than others. The most deeply evil of that religion inflowed into the testicles, and occasioned a certain pain in their inner parts: a sign that they were opposite to the interiors of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5216 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5216. Situs eorum erat, qui remotiores illi regebant anteriores, inde cardinales ulteriores erant; influebant illi in ima pedis sinistri, quia sensuales prae caeteris; intimi mali ex illa religione influebant in testiculos, et interioribus illorum aliquem dolorem inferebant, signum quod prorsus contra interiora coeli. </p>
