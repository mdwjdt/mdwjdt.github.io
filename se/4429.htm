<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4429</h4><p>4429. I spoke about the riches of the world, saying that they are worth nothing, but that they are worth something is due to the use to which they are put, and such as the use is, such is the something that they are, so that when they are very great uses, then they are very much something, but apart from use, they are not anything but dust of the earth, which, when taken, is valued as nothing, but cast out. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4429</h4><p>4429. I spoke of the riches of the world that they are worthless, and that it is use [only] which makes them to be anything, and that such as the use is, such is the something that they are, so that when the uses are very great they are something considerable, but that, abstracted from use, they are nothing more than the dust of the earth, from which whatever is taken is rejected as of no account. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4429 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4429. Loquutus de divitiis mundi quod nihili sint, sed quod aliquid [sint,] est usus ex illis quod hoc facit, et qualis usus, tale est aliquid, ut cum maximi usus tunc multum aliquid, at abstracte ab usu quod non aliud sint quam pulvis terrae, ex quo, qui prorsus nihil aestimatur sed rejicitur. </p>
