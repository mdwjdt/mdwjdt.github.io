<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1370</h4><p>1370. So the Holy Spirit goes forth from the Lord, and was sent by the Lord; thus it is the Lord's. That what is holy with angels and spirits is the Lord's own, and what is an angel's or spirit's own is evil and unclean, is abundantly clear.<p>On this subject many experiences have been brought forward. A human being is not at all holy, except one who acknowledges holiness to be the Lord's, not one's own, whoever does not acknowledge this is profane, in least things and in greatest, this quality being proper to a human being, to his spirit, even to an angel.<p>But to one who does acknowledge it, the Lord's holiness is accredited through belief-nor does the believing belong to man, spirit or angel, but it is of the Lord. And when through faith one is considered holy, and is called sanctified, or a saint, clearly the holiness of a spirit called holy is of the Lord Alone.<p>About the punishment by purging of those who are conceited,<p>trust in themselves, and are thus unwilling to acknowledge inward and very inward truths unless they come through them and so to speak from them<p>[Marginal Note: Their condition in the other life was portrayed by what was seen regarding that spirit, which is to be taken note of in the next 3 pages [<a href="1373.htm">1373-1389</a>].] <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph appears in the margin beside the heading, between vertical lines. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1370</h4><p>1370. Wherefore the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Lord and is sent by the Lord, and thus is the Lord's. That the holiness with angels and spirits is the Lord's proprium, and that the proprium of an angel and of a spirit is evil and unclean, is evident from many things. Many experiences concerning this fact have been adduced. Man is never holy, save he who acknowledges that holiness is the Lord's, not his own. He who does not acknowledge this is profane in the least and in the greatest things: this is the proprium of man, thus of his spirit, and even of an angel. But he who makes this acknowledgment has imputed to him the Lord's holiness through faith. This faith is not of the man, spirit or angel, for it is of the Lord, but since through it he is styled holy and called sanctified or holy, it is evident that the holiness of the spirit termed holy is of the Lord alone. <p>[1370a.] CONCERNING THE PUNISHMENT OF VASTATION OF THOSE WHO ARE OF AN ELATED MIND [animus], TRUST IN THEMSELVES, AND THUS ARE UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE INTERIOR AND MORE INTERIOR VERITIES, UNLESS DERIVED THROUGH THEM AS IF FROM THEMSELVES <p>The state of such spirits in the other life was represented by what was seen as regards a certain spirit, which is to be observed through the three following pages. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph was added in the margin alongside the heading. The three following pages in the manuscript include nos. 1373-1388. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1370 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1370. Quare Spiritus Sanctus procedit a Domino, et missus est a Domino; ita est Domini. Quod sanctum apud angelos et spiritus sit Domini proprium, et quod proprium est angeli et spiritus sit malum et immundum pluribus constat, de qua re experientiae plures allatae sunt. Nusquam homo sanctus est, nisi qui agnoscit sanctum esse Domini, non suum, qui id non agnoscit, is prophanus est, in minimis et in maximis, hoc hominis, ita ejus spiritus, etiam angeli proprium est, at qui agnoscit, imputatur ei sanctitas Domini per fidem, nec fides est hominis, spiritus aut angeli, sed est Domini, et cum per fidem sanctus audit, et vocatur sanctificatus <sup>1</sup></p><p>, aut sanctus, constat quod sanctitas spiritus appellati sancti, sit Solius Domini.<p>De poena vastationis eorum, qui elato animo sunt, sibi fidunt, et sic veritates interiores ac intimiores non agnoscere volunt, nisi per eos sicut ab iis veniant<p>(m)(Eorum status in altera vita, repraesentatus est, per ea quae de spiritu isto visa sunt, quod observandum, per 3 paginas seq.
