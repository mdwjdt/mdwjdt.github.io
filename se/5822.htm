<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5822</h4><p>5822. About those in western India who knew nothing about God<p>I was led in spirit to those who in the world knew nothing about God, they were said to have lived on a certain island in the neighborhood of western Africa, but who still among themselves had lived an adequately well-behaved life. They did not appear like human beings, but like monkeys or apes, and certain ones like dogs, yet with a nearly human face. This is how they appeared to my eyes. I even believed that this is what they were. It happened that there was a certain Christian who was their governor. I spoke with him. He told me that that they appear to themselves with a human face, just like other people, that they obey him, love him, and that they do their work, and that they are well-behaved, but that they are unable to grasp religious matters. But after this, when a closer communication with Christians was made possible, it was perceived that they did receive something of religion and so to some extent could be reformed because they had led a well-behaved life in respect to obedience and diligence which are foundation planes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5822</h4><p>5822. THOSE IN WESTERN INDIA, WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT GOD. <p>I was conducted, in spirit, to those who knew nothing about God in the world, who were said to live in a certain island, near western Africa, but still lived a fairly moral life amongst each other. They did not appear like men, but like monkeys or apes; some like dogs; but, yet, with an almost human face. They seemed thus to my eyes. I also stated that they were such. There was a certain one from the Christians who was governor over them; and I spoke with him. He said that they appeared to themselves with a human face like other men; that they obey and love him, and execute labors; also, that they are modest, but that they are not able to grasp the things of religion. But, afterwards, when a nearer communication with Christians was granted, it was perceived that they also receive somewhat of religion, and that thus they are capable of being reformed to some extent, by reason of the fact that they have led a moral life, in obedience and in industry; which things are planes [for heavenly things]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5822 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5822. De illis in India occidentali qui nihil de Deo sciverunt<p>Perductus sum in spiritu ad illos qui nihil de Deo sciverunt in mundo, qui dicebantur vivere in insula quadam circa Africam occidentalem, sed usque qui inter se moratam satis vitam vixerunt, illi apparebant non sicut homines, sed sicut singi aut simiae, quidam sicut canes, sed usque facie paene humana, ita meis oculis visi, autumabam etiam esse tales, erat quidam enim Christianus qui illis praefectus erat, cum quo loquebar, ille dixit, quod appareant sibi facie humana, et sicut alii homines, quod obediant illi, ament illum, et quod operas faciant, et quod modesti sint, sed quod non capere possint quae religionis sunt; sed postea data communicatione propiore cum Christianis perceptum est quod etiam recipiant aliquid religionis, et sic quod aliquantum reformari possint, ex causa quia moratam vitam egerunt, in obedientia et in sedulitate, quae plana sunt. </p>
