<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3900</h4><p>3900. What they at length become in the other life was also shown. They appear as bony skeletons, so completely bony as to the skull and ribs, that nothing of flesh appears. It was said that they then lose everything living. What then? I do not know, but I can conjecture that they become spirits almost devoid of sensation, serving the kind of uses spoken of earlier [cf. 184, 3187]. 1748, 7 Nov.</p><p>[2] What their inflow is like, I felt: they brought on a pain in the pubic bone, the front bone of the pelvis, which was shown because they are composed of bone. 1748, 7 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3900</h4><p>3900. What they at length become in the other life was also shown. They appear as bony skeletons, -so entirely bony, especially as to the cranium and ribs, that nothing whatever of flesh appears. It was said that they thus lose everything vital. What becomes of them afterwards I do not know; I can, however, conjecture that they become spirits almost totally void of sense, subserving such uses as have been before spoken of. - 1748, November 7.<p>As to the quality of their influx, it was perceived that they cause a pain to the os pubis, which is the bone in front of the pelvis, which was shown; for they are bony. - 1748, November 7. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3900 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3900. Ostensum quales tandem in altera vita fiunt, apparent ut sceleta ossea, prorsus sicut ossea, quoad cranium et costas, ut nihil carnis appareat, dictum quod sic perdant omne vitale; quid postea, non scio; id possum conjectare, quod fiant spiritus absque fere sensu, inservientes talibus usibus de quibus prius [cf. 184, 3[147]. 1748, 7 Nov. Qualis earum influxus sit, perceptum, quod dolorem inferrent ossi pubis, quod est os anterius pelvis, quod ostensum; nam ossei sunt. 1748, 7 Nov. </p>
