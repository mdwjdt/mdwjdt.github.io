<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2868</h4><p>2868. Thought like a breathing out was perceived by spirits and they were led by it<p>Speaking with spirits occurs in diverse ways, ranging from speech very similar to human lingual speech involving clear action on the tongue and speech organs, then to speaking by thought, or thought speaking, even to this more refined way, which is that of inward thought. The speaking <sup>1</sup>of this thought I could not perceive except through a kind of breathing out, as it were, or of thought exhaling from the inward region. Then there are very many intermediate forms of speech, by many of which I have spoken.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original has "thought" here, where "speaking" seems to have been intended. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2868</h4><p>2868. THAT THOUGHT IS PERCEIVED BY SPIRITS, [AS] LIKE AN EXHALATION AND [THAT] THEY ARE LED BY SUCH. <p>I have carried on speaking with spirits in different modes: There is a speech very similar to the human [speech] and to language [linguae] with a manifest action on the tongue and organs of speech - next a cogitative speech as it were, thought speaking besides this purer [speech] which is of interior thought, the thought whereof I did not perceive except by a sort of exhalation as it were, or [a sort] of thought exhaling from the interior. Therefore, there are many intermediate varieties of speech [loquela sunt intermediae plures] [by] many of which I have conversed </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2868 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2868. Quod cogitatio exhalationi similis percepta a spiritibus, et per talem ducti<p>Loquutio cum spiritibus exstitit diversimoda, a loquela simillima humanae et linguae cum actione manifesta in linguam et organa loquelae, tum loquela cogitativa sicut cogitatio loquens, ad puriorem hanc, quae est cogitationis interioris, cujus cogitatio non percepta mihi nisi per speciem quasi exhalationis, seu exhalantis cogitationis ex interiori, sic loquelae sunt intermediae perplures, quarum multis loquutus sum. </p>
