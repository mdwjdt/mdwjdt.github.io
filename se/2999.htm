<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2999</h4><p>2999. On the confirmation of heavenly truths by means of human knowledge<p>I was spoken to out of heaven by means of a kind of general waving motion, thus by an unanimous agreement of many concerning heavenly truths: first, to the effect that they do not need confirmations in support of heavenly truths, since they are in them, just as there is no need of philosophical data for thinking analytically, of knowledge of the muscles for actions, but that they possess all that knowledge from the Lord.<p>As for confirmatory knowledge, it was said that this can be tolerated in the world because of people who are such that truths are confirmed by the sciences, but still, if one cannot confirm them, one should nevertheless believe truths. Otherwise, with some [the sciences] darken the human understanding, with some they cause them to doubt about the truths, with others they cause them to deny them.<p>The rest of the discussion that followed I do not remember, for the world of spirits is permitted to conceal it, which they are also doing. 1748, 30 Aug.<p>That the angels are in possession of all confirmatory knowledge, is amply evident from one example spoken of earlier [<a href="2394.htm">2394-2397</a>], about the many details enumerated [by an angel]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2999</h4><p>2999. CONCERNING THE CONFIRMATION OF CELESTIAL [HEAVENLY] TRUTHS BY MEANS OF HUMAN SCIENTIFICS. <p>Speech concerning heavenly truths was held with me, from heaven, by means of a certain general undulation: thus by means of the unanimous agreement of many [to this effect], first that they have no need of confirming things to confirm heavenly truths, when they are in them, just as there is no need of philosophics to think analytically, no need of sciences [knowledges] of the muscles to [perform] actions; but that all these things they possess from the Lord as respects confirming things, that this may be tolerated in the world on account of men who are of such a character that truths are confirmed by means of sciences: yet [only with him] that still believes truths, though he cannot confirm them: on the other hand, with some, they obscure the human understanding: with others cause doubt concerning truths: with others cause a denial thereof: I do not remember what else followed: the world of spirits is not permitted to cover up these things as they [now] also do. - 1748, August 30. That angels are in the knowledge of all confirming things is sufficiently evident from one example [mentioned] previously concerning so many differences which were enumerated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2999 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2999. De confirmatione veritatum coelestium per scientifica humana<p>Mecum e coelo per undulationem quandam communem ita per consensum unanimum plurium loquutum est de veritatibus coelestibus, primum quod confirmantibus non opus habeant, ad veritatum coelestium confirmationem, cum in illis sunt, sicut ad cogitandum analytice non opus philosophicis, ad actiones non opus musculorum scientiis, sed quod omnia ista possideant a Domino; quod confirmantia attinet, [loquutum] quod hoc in mundo tolerari possit, propter homines qui tales, [h.e.] quod veritates confirmentur per scientias, ita tamen ut si confirmare non possit, usque credat veritatibus; alioquin apud quosdam obscurant intellectum humanum, apud alios faciunt dubitare de veritatibus, apud alios faciunt negare illas; caetera quae sequuta, non memini, nam <sup>1</sup></p><p>permissum est mundo spirituum, ea occultare, quod etiam faciunt. 1748, 30 Aug. Quod angeli in omnium confirmantium cognitione sint, satis constare potest ab uno exemplo, de quo prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2999/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2394" target=_top>2394</a>], de differentiis tot, quas enumeravit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
