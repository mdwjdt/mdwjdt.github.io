<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3251</h4><p>3251. About the inhabitants of Mars<p>An inhabitant of Mars appeared, because the bird was discussed that seems to symbolize them-so far I have not learned otherwise. He appeared just like a human being in the world, so that I perceive and see him faintly as a human being in his own body. When I was surprised at this, he said one who had had this form in the life of the body cannot appear differently [in the other life]. And those who are such, as are the inhabitants of Mars, are spirits clothed with a body. Nor do they care about their bodies, because they are ruled hardly any differently than spirits, so they know they are spirits clothed with a body. Therefore after the death of the body he remains the same. Such also would the men and sons of the most ancient Church have become, if they had remained in a state of integrity, as it is called. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3251</h4><p>3251. CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF MARS.<p>(An inhabitant of Mars appeared, because we spoke concerning the bird [as to] whom it seems to signify. I do not yet know other [than that it denotes the inhabitants of Mars]. He appears like a man in the world, as I perceive. I see obscurely as it were a man in his body. When I wondered thereat he said, that he cannot appear otherwise who has been such in the life of the body; for they who are such, as the inhabitants of Mars, these are spirits clothed with a body, and do not care for their bodies; because they are scarce ruled other than spirits, so that they know they are spirits clothed with a body. Wherefore, after the death of the body, he remains similar. Such also would the men and sons of the most ancient church have become, if they had remained in the state of integrity, as it is called.) </p>

De Martis incolis<p>Martis incola apparuit, quia de ave loquutum, quos significare videtur, adhuc non aliter scio, is apparet sicut homo in mundo, sic ut percipiam eum et <sup>1</sup></p><p>videam obscure sicut hominem in corpore suo, quod cum miratus <sup>2</sup></p><p>, dicebat, quod aliter apparere nequeat, qui talis fuit in vita corporis, qui enim tales, ut incolae Martis, ii sunt spiritus corpore amicti, nec corpora sua curant, quia vix aliter reguntur ac spiritus, sic ut sciant se esse spiritus corpore amictos, quare post mortem corporis manet similis, tales etiam factos fuisse antiquissimae Ecclesiae viros et filios, si permansissent in statu integritatis, ut vocatur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;partim deletum in the Manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
