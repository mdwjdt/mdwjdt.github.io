<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2264</h4><p>2264. Therefore, when by such means they try to penetrate spiritual and heavenly matters, they plunge into mere shadows, as when dust goes into bright light, the light is extinguished in a storm, by clouds, darkness and fog, which they then consider to be light, and wisdom.<p>So their wisdom is merely a darkening of the light, and they blind themselves. No mortals are less wise than those who so proceed, trying to enter into spiritual matters from a philosophy consisting of such trivial dust-such as, for example, that a spirit is substance to which form and manner are not to be attributed. When there is debate over what substance, and what form and manner are, what comes of it but mere fogs, thus errors and consequent denials? 1748, 9 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2264</h4><p>2264. Wherefore since they wish to enter by such things, into spiritual and celestial things, they precipitate themselves into mere shades, as when dust wishes [velit] [to enter] the clear light. Thus the light [lux] is darkened, as it were, by shower [nimbus] cloud, darkness [tenebris] fog, wherein they then place light and wisdom. Wherefore their wisdom is mere obscuration [obtenebratio] of the light [lumen]; thus they blind themselves, and no mortals are less wise than those who proceed thus, and who wish from such philosophy, which is such dust, to enter into spiritual things, as, for example, that spirit is a substance to which [quibus for cui, I think] modes are not to be ascribed; when the dispute is concerning substance and modes, what they are, what thence [arises] but mere fogs, thus errors, consequently negations. - 1748 June 9. </p>
