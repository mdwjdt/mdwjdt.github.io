<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 634</h4><p>634. About the deceptions of the dragon<p>The dragon can be called two-headed in several respects. First because he makes an oral show of penitence, speaking as though he repented, while at heart he is fostering deceptions - and this at one and the same moment, very much like those false people who can pretend [friendship] in facial expressions and gestures while they harbor enmity at heart. This ability, which rarely exists with spirits, is nevertheless found in the dragon; for he can speak pleasingly, while at the same time plotting evil - as he did today, when he called together evil spirits with the purpose of secretly attacking good ones and destroying their belief.<p>Then besides this, he also meddles into every single thing that the spirits closest by are doing or thinking, so that he has more attentive ears than any other evil spirit, watching for [the chance to do] evil things. He has very little ability left to do what is good. 1748, 2 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 634</h4><p>634. CONCERNING THE DECEITS OF THE DRAGON <p>The dragon can be called double-headed in many ways, inasmuch as he makes a show of penitence with the mouth and speaks as if he had repented, and yet at heart he cherishes deceits, and this at one and the same moment, almost like deceitful men who can simulate with their face and gestures, when yet they bear enmity in their heart. This is rarely the case among spirits, but is to be met with in the dragon. He can speak sweetly whilst at the same time he is contriving evil, as today, when he called together evil spirits for the purpose of clandestinely attacking the good and destroying their faith. Moreover, he also mixes himself with the single things which the nearest spirits are doing and thinking, so that he has more attentive ears than another evil spirit, watching diligently for evils. He has very little residue of the faculty for good remaining. 1748, Feb. 2. </p>

De draconis dolis<p>Draco potest vocari biceps pluri modo, tam quod praeferat poenitentiam ore et loquatur sicut resipisceret <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et tamen corde fovet dolos, et hoc uno eodemque momento, paene sicut fallaces homines, qui simulare possunt faciebus et gestibus, cum tamen inimicitias corde ferunt, quod rarum datur in spiritibus; hoc tamen in dracone offenditur, loqui potest suaviter, eo tempore cum molitur malum, sicut hodie, cum convocaret malos spiritus, clandestine aggrediendi bonos, et destruendi eorum fidem; praeterea etiam se immiscet singulis, quae agunt et cogitant spiritus proximi, sic ut attentiores aures habeat, quam alius spiritus malus, invigilans malis, is perparum residui facultatis ad bonum habet remanens. 1748, 2 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
