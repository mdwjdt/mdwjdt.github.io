<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第419节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>419.一些灵人，尤其拉普兰人和类似他们的人，陷入一种幻觉，即：他们正抱着婴孩，想把他们给天上的主看看。有些人在进入来世的时候，完全陷入一种幻想，即：他们怀里抱着婴孩，甚至抱着尽可能多的婴孩；如果婴孩数量众多，他们就毫无秩序地进行摆放，同时把男孩和女孩排成一行摆在自己面前。他们以这种方式求问那地方的主；想给祂看他们的婴儿和孩子。然而，当被问及他们为何这么做时，他们说，他们想喂养自己的孩子。在讯问中，就发现这些人和以前长期住在拉普兰地区的人很相似，在穿着上与他们没什么不同。但这种做法现在已经开始了，因为他们已经得到指示。起初他们不是以这种方式进来的，而是用黑色的角发出低沉的两声，就带着可怕的小动物进来了。这些人由于对婴孩的爱而比其他许多人更容易接受，因为众天堂都喜欢这种爱。（1747年12月30日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 419</h4><p>419. Certain ones, especially the Laplanders and similar peoples, are governed by a fantasy that they are carrying little children, and want to show them to the Lord of Heaven<p>There are some who are completely governed when they come into the other life by the imagination that there are little children in their arms, as many as they can possibly carry in all kinds of positions, just so there is a multitude of them, and at the same time, a line of boys and girls out in front of them. [Approaching] in this manner, they ask where the Lord of the place is, wanting to show Him their infants and children. However, when asked [why], they said that they wanted to nourish their children.<p>On interrogation, these appeared to be like the people who have long inhabited Lapland, and not unlike them as to dress. But this has now begun, because they have now been instructed, and previously they did not come in this manner, but at the sound of two muffled horn blasts, they would enter with hideous little animals.<p>Those people, on account of their love of little children, are more acceptable than many others, for the heavens love that love. 1747, 30 December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 419</h4><p>419. THAT CERTAIN SPIRITS, PARTICULARLY THE LAPLANDERS AND THOSE LIKE THEM, ARE GOVERNED BY THE PHANTASY THAT THEY ARE CARRYING INFANTS AND WANT TO SHOW THEM TO THE LORD OF HEAVEN <p>There are those who when they enter the other life are governed by the imagination that they have infants in their arms, even as many as they are able to carry, placed without order provided there is a multitude of them, and at the same time they have boys and girls placed before them in a row, and in this manner they inquire for the Lord of the place; they want to show Him their infants and children. But yet when it was asked [why they did so], they said that they want to feed their children. On interrogation these are found to be like those who are formerly of Lapland, with garments not dissimilar. But this practice has now begun because they have now been instructed. At first they did not come in this way, but sending forth two of them with dark colored horns, they entered with horrid little animals. On account of their love of infants, they are more acceptable than many others, for this the heavens love. 1747, Dec. 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 419 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>419. Quod quidam, in specie Lappones et similes phantasia regantur, quod infantes portent, et ostendere velint Domino Coeli<p>Sunt qui ex imaginatione reguntur, dum in alteram vitam veniunt, quod infantes inter brachia [habeant], quotquot usque portare queant, inordinato positu, modo multitudo sit, ac simul pueros et puellas ante positos, in serie, et sic quaerunt ubi Dominus loci, ei volunt infantes et liberos suos ostendere, sed usque dum inquirebatur, dicebant, quod ii velint liberos suos alere; hi ex interrogatione sunt similes iis qui Lapponiae olim sunt, vestibus iis nec absimiles; sed hoc nunc inceptum est, quia nunc instructi sunt, prius non ita venerunt, sed emissis duobus fuscis cornubus, cum tetris animalculis intrabant: illi ob amorem infantum multis aliis acceptiores sunt, nam coeli illum amant. 1747, 30 Dec. </p>
