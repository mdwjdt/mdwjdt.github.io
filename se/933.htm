<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 933</h4><p>933. Souls who have a strong action through their aura [<a href="931.htm">931</a>], and who change and distort the aura of thought belonging others, doing this because of tendencies ingrained in their character, not only as it were twist goodness around into something agreeable with their nature or aura. They also, sometimes and if circumstances invite it, twist evil into what is good, but with the purpose of deception, and also because [in life] they had liked to twist everything in order to hide what they were after. 1748, 22 February. These are cases based on experience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 933</h4><p>933. Souls who act powerfully by their sphere, and bend or pervert the sphere of the thoughts of another - and this, by reason of what has been implanted - not only turn, as it were, things that are good into what agrees with their own nature or sphere, but in certain cases, they sometimes turn things that are evil into good to the end that they may deceive, and also because they have desired to distort all things, and in this way to conceal their own cupidities. 1748, Feb. 22. These things are from experience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 933 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>933. Animae quae fortiter per sphaeram agunt, et alius sphaeram cogitationum flectunt seu pervertunt, et hoc ex insitis in indole, ii non solum quae bona sunt obliquant quasi in id quod convenit eorum naturae seu sphaerae, verum etiam quandoque, in certis casibus, quae mala sunt in bonum, sed ob finem ut decipiantur, tum ex causa, qoud omnia cupiverint contorquere, et sic abscondere suas cupiditates. 1748, 22 Febr. Haec ab experientia. </p>
