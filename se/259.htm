<p>259.许多被囚在坑里的人正在上升，因此，末期即将来临。关于低级事物之地。蒙弥赛亚神怜悯，今夜醒来时，我还被恩准获知许多被囚在坑里的人（参看228, 244）现正被弥赛亚神带上来，也就是从末层天堂之下的坑里，也就是所谓的低级事物之地被带出来。这种上升持续了很长一段时间，由此可以断定人数有很多。那些有信的人正在被提升；这一点还以金黄色的小灵人的形像被表现出来。由此可以断定，现在末期即将来临。所以世人要儆醒！（1747年11月20日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 259</h4><p>259. Very many of those bound in the pit are ascending, and therefore the last time is at hand<p>About the place of the lower ones<p>This night at a time of wakefulness, also by the mercy of God the Messiah, I was enabled to learn that very many of those bound in the pit [see <a href="228.htm">228</a>, <a href="244.htm">244</a>] are now being borne upward by God the Messiah, that is, from the pit (which is the last Heaven), otherwise called the place of the lower ones. The ascent lasted for quite a long time, which leads the conclusion that there were very many. And that it was the believers who were being raised up, was also shown - by spirits of gold, small ones in effigy. From this one may conclude that the last time is now at hand. Therefore, let those on earth be watchful! <a href="1747.htm">1747</a>, the <a href="20.htm">20</a>th day of November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 259</h4><p>259. THAT VERY MANY OF THOSE FOUND IN THE PIT ARE ASCENDING, AND THUS THE LAST TIME IS AT HAND. CONCERNING THE PLACE OF LOWER THINGS <p>This night when awake, of the mercy of God Messiah, it was also granted me to perceive that very many of those "bound in the pit" are being taken upwards by God Messiah, that is, out of the pit which is beneath the ultimate heaven, otherwise called the "place of lower things". The ascent lasted some considerable time, whence it can be concluded that there were very many, and that those who were faithful were being raised up. This was also shown [representatively] in an image by little spirits of gold. From this it can be concluded that the last time is now at hand; wherefore let men be watchful. 1747, Nov. 20, o.s. </p>
