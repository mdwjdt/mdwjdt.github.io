<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1299</h4><p>1299. Moreover, in the world this person had been considered among the more respectable, except that he was said to be clever, or by others perhaps, wise. He had held a high position, was well thought of, and was engaged in state affairs of great importance. So this shows how a person can, in bodily life, hide his true character and put on the appearance of one who is not evil. 1748, 11 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1299</h4><p>1299. Moreover, in the world this spirit dwelt among quite honorable people, except that he was said to be crafty - perhaps some said prudent. He lived in dignity and was esteemed, and he was employed in affairs of great importance to his kingdom. Thus it can be further evident how a man can conceal himself and in the life of the body can put on the appearance of a man who is not evil. 1748, Mar. 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1299 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1299. Praeterea is in mundo habitus est inter honestiores, praeter quod dictus callidus, aliis forte prudens, in dignitate, et aestimatus, et adhibitus in regni negotiis magni usus, ita quomodo homo celare se queat, et in vita corporis induere speciem hominis non mali, constare potest. 1748, 11 Martius. </p>
