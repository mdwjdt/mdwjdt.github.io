<p>574.从他们的面部语言可以推断出，他们能快速、充分理解地一个同伴和他们的灵人所说的任何话，当然也能快速、充分理解地那些更完美的人和他们的天使所说的任何话。因为这是一种摆脱了分散思维、把它们拆分为各个要点的详尽细节的一种语言。1)因此，他们能将思维看作一个整体，因为思维里面有许多同时存在的东西，正如他们所说，如当一个人几乎看一眼就会想到或看到所描绘的东西，连同它里面的一切情感时；所以他们能意识到言语里面藏有什么样的情感。因为这个缘故，对他们来说，那张说话的脸就是他们真实情感的标志，眼睛周围甚至是心智的标志。他们根本不会掩饰，因此内在和更内在的生命本身就在他们的言语里面。他们能以这种方式与他们的天人交谈，因为如此他们的观念就不会沉浸于尘世和肉体事物中。这种沉浸会导致内在事物被切断，在这个地球上使得人们外在像天使，内在像野兽。2)木星灵感到惊讶的是，这个地球之人的脸还能有一点美丽，而且它们没有变形。但这是由另一个原因造成的。（1748年1月27日）<p>574a.刚才我与那些在场的木星灵交谈，他们说，在来世，这个地球的恶人脸会逐渐变形、扭曲，以至于由于丑陋，这些人无法被他们看到。我被告知，他们美丽的脸来自他们纯真的婴儿期。（1748年9月4日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 574</h4><p>574. It can be inferred from their facial speech that they understand quite fully and quickly whatever a companion, and what their spirits speak, and of course, those who are more perfect, what their angels speak. For it is a speech free of elaborations that distract the thoughts and break them up into main points. Thus they can see the thoughts as a whole, for there are many things in them simultaneously, as when a person thinks or sees what is pictured almost at a single glance, as they say, together with all the feelings that are in it; so they are able to recognize what feeling lies within the speech.<p>Therefore with them, the face speaking is the index of their true feelings - and around the eyes, even of their mind. And they are not at all able to dissemble, and therefore their inward and more inward life itself is in their speech.<p>So they are able to speak with their heavenly beings, because their ideas are not thus immersed in earthly and bodily matters. Such an immersion causes the inward parts to be cut off, and, on this earth, makes people outwardly like angels, but inwardly like wild animals. They are surprised that any beauty can exist on the faces of this earth, and that they are not deformed. But this results from a different cause. 1748, 27 January.<p>Just now I spoke to those spirits from Jupiter who were present, saying that the evil people of this earth in the other life gradually become so ugly and deformed in their face, that they cannot look at them on account of their ugliness. I was told that their beautiful faces come from their infancy, which is innocent. 1748, 4 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 574</h4><p>574. From their facial speech it can be concluded that they understand quite fully and quickly the things which a companion says, and which their spirits say, and indeed those who are more perfect, what their angels say; for the particulars which distract and divide the thoughts into matters of too great import, are absent. <p>(1) Thus they can see the thoughts fully, for there are many things together there, almost as when a man thinks, or sees his thoughts delineated before the eye, as they say, together with the affections themselves which are therein; wherefore they can recognize what affection lies hidden in the speech. On this account, the speaking face is with them the index of the "animus", and around the eyes is even the index of the mind; nor can they simulate in any respect. Thus the interior and the more interior life itself is within their speech. In this way they can speak with their heavenly ones, for thus their ideas are not immersed in earthly and corporeal things which cause interior things to be separated, and, on this earth, make men like the angels outwardly, but inwardly like wild beasts. <p>(2) The spirits of Jupiter wondered that there can be any beauty in the faces of the men of this earth, and that they are not distorted; but this comes about from another cause. 1748, Jan. 27. <p>[574a.] <sup>1</sup>I have now spoken to those spirits of Jupiter who were present, and they said that in the other life the evil of this earth gradually become so deformed and distorted as to their face, that, on account of their deformity, they cannot be looked at by them. It was said to me that their beautiful faces come from their infancy, which is innocent. 1748, Sept. 4. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph was added by Swedenborg when he was compiling the Index. </p>

Concludi potest a loquela faciei eorum, quod plenius et citius intelligant ea, quae socius, et quae spiritus eorum loquuntur, imo perfectiores, quae eorum angeli, nam particularia, quae distrahunt et in majora momenta dividunt cogitata absunt, sic cogitationes plene videre possunt, nam plura simul insunt, sicut dum homo cogitat paene, aut videt delineata oculo, ut dicitur, uno, cum ipsis affectionibus, quae insunt, quare cognoscere possunt, quae affectio latet in loquela; quare facies loquens apud eos est index animi, imo mentis, sed circum oculos, nec simulare uspiam possunt, ipsa sic vita interior, ac intimior, inest loquelae; ita possunt cum coelestibus eorum loqui, nam sic nec ideae immerguntur terrenis et corporeis, quae faciunt, ut separentur interiora, et extus simulent <sup>1</sup></p><p>in hac tellure angelos, at intus feras; mirantur, quod pulchritudo aliqua dari potest faciebus hujus telluris, et quod non distortae sint, sed hoc ex alia causa venit. 1748, 27 Jan.
