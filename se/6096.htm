<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6096</h4><p>6096. CONJUGIAL LOVE: A SYNOPSIS. <p>I. N. B. - In the Divine sense, it is the marriage of love and wisdom in the Lord: hence the two [partners] are an image of the Lord. <p>II. 1. The marriage of the Lord with Heaven and the Church. <p>III. 2. The marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth. <p>IV. 3. Heaven is called a marriage - and the church, also. <p>V. 4. The Word is a marriage, because it is Divine Good united with Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord. <p>VI. 5. Man, male and female, or husband and wife, are especially that marriage. That marriage is in every single thing in nature. <p>VII. 6. Conjugial love is the fundamental of all loves. <p>VIII. 7. Conjugial love is a heavenly love. <p>IX. 8. Conjugial love is not possible, save between two. <p>X. 9. Two married partners are continually being united, and according to the unition, potency and delight increase. <p>XI. 10. Adultery is the union of the devil and those who are adulterers. It is the union of evil and falsity. <p>XII. Hell is adultery, and evil, also. There cannot be found any who say it is in themselves. <p>XIII. The adulteration of the good of the Word, and the falsification of its truth, is adultery: many things about this. <p>XIV. Adultery is opposed to creation. <p>XV. Adultery is the fundamental love of all evils. <p>XVI. Adultery is the commingling of many lives in one. <p>XVII. Potency diminishes, and aversion takes place; it also becomes common, unaccompanied by any sensation, and, at last, there is aversion. <p>XVIII. What sort of whoredoms the adulteries which destroy conjugial love are. <p>XIX. The various kinds of adulteries: see immediately above. <p>MARRIAGE AND ADULTERY. <p>XX. To acknowledge charity and not faith, is adultery of a brother and a sister. <p>XXI. Man is formed by conjugial love, to be a form of love, whence come all the remaining heavenly loves. <p>XXII. The destruction of that form is from adulteries. <p>XXIII. Hell is adultery. <p>XXIV. The following things correspond to the acts of adulteries there: <p>XXV. Those who worship only the Father, and think nothing of the Lord's Divine, are in the adultery as of a brother with a sister. <p>XXVI. Those who are in faith alone, are in the adultery as of a mother with a son. <p>XXVIII. <sup>1</sup>Those who are in the mere sense of the letter, and study that for the sake of honor only, are in the adultery of a father with a daughter-in-law. <p>XXIX. Those who are in the highest degree of the love of ruling from the love of self, and not for the sake of use, are in Sodom. <p>XXX. Those who are in the delight of variety of adultery, are such as love commerce with beasts and they become like the mucus of the nostrils. <p>XXXI. [I learned] by experience, in the night time, from those in faith alone who were in an expanse above, that those same things which are in the creed of faith separated, are turned into various foul whoredoms. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is no section XXVII., here, in the original. -TR. </p>
