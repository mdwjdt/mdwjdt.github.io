<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2288</h4><p>2288. a spirit, as he could know from the fact that he was so high overhead, not standing on the earth, so that he could now realize this. And then he fled away, frightened, crying that he was a spirit, he was a spirit, because, as he said, he had never before known, or had not understood, what the soul is, or that it is.<p>This has happened quite frequently, that people were extremely surprised that they were [departed] souls or spirits, since they had formerly never believed, because they had not understood, what a spirit, and what a soul is. For the most part they then complain, [asking] where they should go, not knowing where they live or are staying, and such matters of concern in the world.<p>I was then prompted to say that the Lord takes care of all, and they have no need for houses, or clothing, or food. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2288</h4><p>2288. that he is now a spirit which he could know hence, because he is so high above the head, [and] that he does not stand upon the earth [telluri] that he could now perceive this, then being terrified he fled, crying out that he is a spirit, that he is a spirit because as he said, he never knew it before, or because he has not understood what is the soul, nor that he is a soul. This occurred very often, [namely,] that they were greatly astonished at being souls or spirits, since they had never before believed it because they had not understood what is the spirit and what the soul; so that they then complain very much [as to] whither they repair, not knowing where to dwell, and stay, and the like that [concerned them] in the world. Then was it given to say to them that the Lord looks out [consulit] for them, and they have no need of houses nor garments, nor food. - 1748, June 10. </p>
