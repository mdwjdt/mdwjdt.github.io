<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2284</h4><p>2284. Evil spirits especially hate little children<p>By much experience I have also been enabled to learn that evil spirits especially hate little children. Quite often when I have seen little children, they wanted to hurt them in various ways, even to kill them, as I was given to know from seeing their fantasies. Children's objects, things that give little ones joy, they also hate-in short, anything pertaining to little children. The reason is that little children are innocent beings, and it is innocent people most of all that they persecute and hate.<p>I asked them whether they would like to do the same to their own little children. They said they would not-only to other people's children, and that they cannot refrain from that kind of hatred. The reason is that they hate the Lord, Who Alone is Innocence. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2284</h4><p>2284. THAT EVIL SPIRITS ESPECIALLY HOLD INFANTS IN HATRED. <p>It is also given me to know by much experience that evil spirits especially hold infants in hatred; for often when I saw infants, they desired to harm them in various ways [vario modo], yea, to kill them, which was given me to know from their phantasies. Even the infantile, which they enjoy, do (these spirits) hold in hatred; in a word, [they hate] whatever is infantile, by reason that infants are innocences; thus they greatly pursue and hold in hatred the innocent. I inquired whether they also wished to do thus to their own infants. They said no; but [to those] of others, and that they cannot moderate such hatred in themselves. The reason is, because they hold in hatred the Lord, who alone is Innocence. - 1748, June 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2284 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2284. Quod mali spiritus infantes imprimis odio habeant<p>2284 mali spiritus imprimis infantes odio habeant, saepius enim cum viderim infantes, eos vario modo laedere cupiebant, imo interimere, quod ex eorum phantasiis nosse mihi dabatur; etiam infantilia, quae iis sunt gaudio, odio quoque habent, verbo quicquid est infantile, ex causa quod infantes sint innocentiae, sic maxime innocentes persequuntur et odio habent: quaesivi num etiam sic facere vellent suis infantibus, dicebant non, sed aliorum, et quod se temperare nequeant a tali odio; causa est, quia Dominum odio habent, Qui Solus est Innocentia. 1748, 10 Junius. </p>
