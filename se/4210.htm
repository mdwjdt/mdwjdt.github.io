<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4210</h4><p>4210. It was granted me to speak with angelic spirits, but by means of intermediate ones, in which case very many thoughts do not reach me, only generals. It was granted me also to speak with them by means of generals, but by general mental images, which imagery I thought only most generally and consequently most obscurely, while the angelic spirits were perceiving in those generals distinct and singular details - which was also at the time given me to realize. 1749, 14 April. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4210</h4><p>4210. It was granted me to speak with angelic spirits, but through intermediates, when barely a few general ideas, instead of many particulars, reached me. It was given me to speak with them through these general ideas or impressions which in my mind from being thus general were extremely obscure, but to the perception of angelic spirits everything stood forth distinguished into its most minute and singular items, as it was also then given. - 1749, April 14. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4210 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4210. Datum fuit loqui cum spiritibus angelicis, sed per intermedios, tunc perplura non veniunt ad me, solum communia: datum quoque cum iis loqui per communia, seu per communes ideas, quas ideas ego cogitavi solum communissime et sic obscurissime, at spiritus angelici distincta et singularia in iis perceperunt, quod quoque tunc datum mihi scire. 1749, 14 Apr. </p>
