<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4044</h4><p>4044. countless groupings of feelings. Then there are generals that are not so grouped as to make a one, which are present at the same time, as when a person in thought, and yet notices the things in his path, and like instances. These generals come from the inward region. Inward qualities appear in the bodily memory as generals, for in any other form they cannot flow in, for they arrange the bodily memory in general with respect to the variations of its generals.<p>But evil spirits are linked, so to speak, with details of the memory with those who are thinking evils, thus not only in the chain with the nearest spirit, but also the evil spirits farther off. It is a chain, because with those who do not have true faith, details are brought forth by evil spirits, [but with those] having true faith, the Lord arranges even the very least things through the inward regions, and through heaven and the angels. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4044</h4><p>4044. Then there are also generals which are not so consociated as to make a one, which are simultaneously present, as when a man is thinking and yet notes the objects that occur in his path, and the like. These generals proceed from what is interior; things interior appear in the corporeal memory as generals; angels cannot otherwise flow in, for they dispose the corporeal memory in a general way as to the variations of its general [ideas]. But evil spirits are, as it were, in a chain of connection with the particulars of the memory of those who think evil, so that not only are the nearest spirits in such a chain, but also more remote evil spirits. It is truly a chain, for with those who are not in true faith, the particulars are produced by evil spirits; but with those who are in true faith, the Lord disposes, through the interiors and through heaven and the angels, each distinct particular. - 1748, November 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4044 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4044. fectionum consociationes indefinitae; tum quoque sunt communia quae non ita consociata ut unum faciunt, quae simul adsunt, ut dum homo cogitat et usque videt obvia, et similia. Communia haec ab interiori veniunt, quae interiora sunt apparent in memoria corporea ut communia, non aliter influere possunt, nam disponunt in communi memoriam corpoream, quoad variationes ejus communium; at spiritus mali in catena quasi sunt cum particularibus memoriae apud eos qui mala cogitant, ita non solum in catena proximi spiritus, sed etiam remotiores mali, est catena, quia apud eos qui non in vera fide producuntur particularia a malis spiritibus, [apud eos] qui in vera fide, disponit Dominus per interiora, perque coelum et angelos etiam singularia. 1748, 23 Nov. </p>
