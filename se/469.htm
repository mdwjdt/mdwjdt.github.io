<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第469节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>469.关于被雅各召集起来的犹太人，以及总体上的贪婪者。现在在我头上的雅各，站在一个垂直的位置上，取代那个从那里下来并顺服的人。他因失去了崇拜者，所以像往常一样斜躺在床上；夸大自己，召唤其他人到他的床前（参看462节），邀请他们到他的天堂。就在他这样躺着的时候，许多犹太人来到他面前；我在一个晚上的大部分时间里从老鼠的臭味中察觉到了这一点。当我再也无法忍受它的时候，在灵人的天堂有人调查这股恶臭是从哪里来的。一些人说，他们也因这臭味而备受困扰。不过，经过调查发现，他们是犹太人；他们觉得自己似乎从小房间被提升到雅各那里，许多人就这样被聚集到雅各面前；老鼠的臭味由此而来。雅各说他周围有如此多的老鼠，以致他再也无法忍受；于是，他几乎是从床上跳了下来。这些犹太人抱怨他们没有留在自己的小房间里，他们的钱在那里，他们害怕小偷把钱偷走。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 469</h4><p>469. About the Jews called together by Jacob, and about the greedy in general<p>The Jacob who is now above my head, occupies that vertical position in place of him who let himself down from there and submitted himself. Because he had been deprived of worshippers he is reclining in his usual manner on his bed, grandiose, summoning the rest to his bed [see <a href="462.htm">462</a>]. Many of the Jews came to him as he was thus lying down, which I sensed through much of the night by the stench of mice.<p>When I could no longer bear it, it was asked in the heaven of spirits whence that stench came. Some declared that they had been troubled by the same smell, but as a result of inquiry, it was found that they were Jews who had been lifted up out of their own rooms, as it seems to them, to Jacob, before whom many were thus gathered together. Thence came the stench of mice.<p>Jacob told that he was surrounded by so many mice, that he could not stand them any longer, whereupon, being almost ejected from his bed, he betook himself downwards.<p>Those same people were complaining, because they had not stayed in their rooms, where their money was, which they were afraid thieves might take away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 469</h4><p>469. CONCERNING THE JEWS CALLED TOGETHER BY JACOB, AND CONCERNING THE AVARICIOUS IN GENERAL <p>Jacob - who is now above my head and occupies a vertical situation in the place of him who let himself down thence and was made subject - reclining as usual on a bed, because he was deprived of worshippers [made himself] great, and others were invited to his heaven. Many of the Jews came to him as he thus lay, which I perceived during a great part of the night from the stench of mice. When I could bear it no longer, inquiry was made in the heaven of spirits whence came this stench. Some said that they themselves were grievously affected by it. But after inquiry it was found that they were Jews, who, as it seemed to themselves, had been raised up out of their cells to Jacob, to whom many were thus gathered together; hence the stench of mice. Jacob stated that he was surrounded by so many mice that he could bear them no longer; wherefore having been as it were cast out of his bed, he betook himself downwards. Those same Jews lamented that they had not remained in their cells, where their money was, which they feared thieves would carry off. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 469 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>469. De Judaeis convocatis a Jacobo, et de avaris in genere<p>Jacobus qui nunc super caput meum est, et verticalem locum occupat, loco ejus qui inde se demisit, subjecitque: ille, quia destitutus erat adoratoribus, decumbens, ut solitus in lecto suo [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_469/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_462" target=_top>462</a>], magnus, ad lectum ejus invitantur reliqui, ad eum sic jacentem venerunt multi ex Judaeis, quod per noctem multam percepi foetore murum, quem cum amplius non sustinere potuissem, inquisitum erat in coelo spirituum, unde foetor iste; quidam se ajebant eodem graviter affectos, sed post inquisitionem inventum est, quod essent Judaei, qui ex cellis suis, ut sibi videntur, elevati essent, ad Jacobum, ad quem sic multi collecti, inde foetor murum; Jacobus id narrabat, quod muribus tot circum funderetur, ut eos non amplius sustinere potuisset, quare e lecto suo quasi ejectus deorsum se contulit; iidem querebantur quod non mansissent in cellis suis, ubi eorum pecuniae, quas timebant, quod fures auferrent. </p>
