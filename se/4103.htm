<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4103</h4><p>4103. About the descendants of Jacob, and about the Church<p>It was imparted to me that when they had finally become so immersed in falsities that nothing but what is false occupied their minds, it came about that in the time of Jacob they were then being purged, as those in the other life usually are who are so immersed in a life of false convictions that they knew nothing of true worship, and then for the first time, higher knowledge was imparted to them. This was done, for they were in such ignorance and such obscure confusion, that they did not even know moral law, nor civil law, admonishing them not to commit adultery, not to kill, not to steal. But because their life of passions was such, which they had derived from Jacob, they could [be instructed] neither by means of miracles, nor by the prophets. 1748, 30 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4103</h4><p>4103. CONCERNING THE POSTERITY OF JACOB AND THE CHURCH.<p>It was insinuated that when at length they became so immersed in falsities, that nothing but the false occupied their minds which happened in the time of Jacob, that then they were vastated, as those are wont to be in the other life who are in the life of the persuasions of the false, so that they knew nothing of true worship, and knowledge was then first insinuated into their mind. This was done from their being in such ignorance and such a confused mental obscurity, that they neither knew moral nor civil law, nor that they were forbidden to commit adultery, to kill, or to steal. They could not be made to know this either by miracles or by prophets, because such was the life of their cupidities derived from Jacob. - 1748, November 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4103 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4103. De Jacobi posteris, et Ecclesia<p>Insinuatum, cum tandem ita immersi essent falsitatibus, ut nihil nisi falsum occuparet eorum mentes, quod factum tempore Jacobi, quod tunc vastarentur, sicut solent in altera vita ii qui in vita persuasionum falsi sunt, ut prorsus nihil scirent de cultu vero, et tunc primum insinuaretur iis cognitio; quod et factum, nam in tali ignorantia, et obscure confuso erant, ut ne [quidem] scirent legem moralem, nec civilem, ne scilicet adulterarent, ne occiderent, ne furarentur; sed quia vita eorum cupiditatum talis erat, quam traxerunt a Jacobo, non potuerunt, neque per miracula, nec per prophetas [instrui]. 1748, 30 Nov. </p>
