<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5573</h4><p>5573. A certain one who was a demon was known to me in the world, Lag. Frolick. <sup>1</sup>He was among spirits for a long time and could lead them, namely, their thoughts, wherever he wished, and also lead them away however he pleased. They did not know that he was a demon. They also said that they were entirely unable to resist him but that he had been able to compel them to think whatever he wanted, as he himself also admitted. He came to me too and did the same thing with my thoughts in such a way that he was able to lead as to the least details there, and also by force brought himself into the province of the chest. And there it was discovered that he was a demon and among the spirits who had been known to me in the world. Many spirits clung to him, up to several hundred. They said that he was able to accept their thoughts, not so others. They were evil and for the most part nature worshipers as he also was inwardly in himself.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Dr. Achatius Kahl takes this to be Ulrik Christopher Frolich, a Swedish provincial judge, and, in his latter days, Vice-Governor of Christianstadt. He was born in 1678 and died about 1750 (Narratiunculae 20). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5573</h4><p>5573. A certain one belonging to the genii, was known to me in the world (Lag: Frolick). <sup>1</sup>He was long among the spirits; and he was able to lead all whomsoever he wished, namely, through thoughts, and also to lead them away at his pleasure. They did not know that he was of the genii. They said, also, that they were altogether unable to resist him; but that he could compel them to think whatsoever he would; as, also, he himself admitted. He came to me, likewise, and did in like manner with my thoughts, so that he was able to lead the minutest things there; and also introduced himself, by the hand, into the province of the breast. It was there, also, discovered that he was one of the genii, and among spirits with whom I was acquainted in the world. Many spirits adhered to him, even up to several hundreds. They said that he was able to take up their thoughts; others not so. They were evil and mostly naturalistic; and, inwardly in himself, he was also. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Dr. Kahl takes this to be intended for Ulrik Christopher Frolich, a Swedish judge-provincial, and, in his latter days, Vice-Governor of Christianstadt. He was born in 1678 and died about 1750 (See Narratiunculoe, p. 20). -ED. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5573 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5573. Quidam qui fuit genius mihi in mundo notus, Lag. Frolick, is diu erat apud spiritus, et ille potuit omnes quoscunque vellet ducere, nempe cogitationes eorum, et quoque abducere ad libitum, nesciebant quod esset genius, dicebant etiam quod prorsus non ei resistere possent, sed quod ad cogitandum quodcunque vellet, potuisset; quod etiam ipse fassus; ad me etiam venit, et similiter fecit cum meis cogitationibus, sic ut minutissima ibi ducere posset, et quoque manu intulit se in provinciam pectoris; et ibi repertus quod esset genius, et inter spiritus qui mihi noti in mundo, adhaeserunt ei multi spiritus, usque ad aliquot centenos, dicebant quod ille recipere eorum cogitata posset, non ita alii, erant mali, et naturalistae plerique, et quoque ille intus in se. </p>
