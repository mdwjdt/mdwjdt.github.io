<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2575</h4><p>2575. Now again I was enabled to learn from experience that they could be brought by the spirits below them into a kind of sleep, so that they were so sleepy they did not know what they were doing. It is almost like when the outer parts of a person are put to sleep, and the inward parts are awake. For I saw something sparkling, which was from their life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2575</h4><p>2575. It was now also granted to know by experience that they could be reduced by the spirits beneath them into a sort of sleep, so as to be ignorant what they did. They were put to sleep in such a manner as is almost similar when man's exteriors are put to sleep, and his interiors are awake; for I have perceived a certain sparkling [something] which was from their life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2575 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2575. Nunc quoque per experientiam scire dabatur, quod reduci potuerint a spiritibus infra eos in speciem somni, ut nescirent quid facerent, ita soporati, quod se similiter paene habet, ac dum exteriora hominis sopita sunt, ac interiora vigilant, nam quoddam scintillans, quod erat ex vita eorum, percepi. </p>
