<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4094</h4><p>4094. About sibylla<p>A certain Roman of renown, when told that it had been prophesied concerning the Lord that He would come into the world and save the universal human race, he listened attentively; and presently he began to move with a kind of holy tremor that was felt to run through the head toward the chest; and he said that he also had known from the Sibylline books, as he called them, that someone would come. But he had thought that one would come who would rule over the whole world, but it was imparted to him that [He rules] over the universe, and all who are therein. 1728, 28 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4094</h4><p>4094. CONCERNING THE SYBIL.<p>A certain celebrated Roman, on being told that it was predicted concerning the Lord that he should come into the world to save the human race, respectfully gave heed. Shortly after he began to be affected by a certain sacred and religious trembling, which was perceived to extend from the head to the breast, and he remarked that he also knew from the Sybilline books, as he called them, that some [great personage] was to come [on earth]; but he supposed that the one who should come would reign over the whole world. It was insinuated to him that he was to reign over the universe of beings. - 1748, November 28. </p>

De sibylla<p>Quidam Romanus, famigeratus, cum ei dictum, quod prophetatum sit de Domino, quod venturus in mundum et salvaret universum genus humanum, attendebat; et mox incepit movere quodam tremore sacro, qui perceptus et percurrebat caput ad pectus, et dixit, quod is quoque noverit quendam venturum ex sibyllinis bibliis, ut vocat; sed putarat, quod venturus, qui dominaretur super universum terrarum orbem, sed ei insinuatum, quod super universum et omnes regnet. 1748, 28 Nov. </p>
