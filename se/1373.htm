<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1373</h4><p>1373. One like this had been wrapped in such a woolen veil, which took place near me, and while he was unrolling himself, he slipped down to the left in a long series of rolls, in a course slanting deeply toward the lower earth above the place where, on the other side, woodcutters are. He was let down into the depth, meanwhile seeming to lift himself by rolling back up, but in vain, again being let down toward the depth.<p>1373. 1/2. Indeed, also his hands appeared, detached from his body, first his left hand, which went upward. He complained that he had lost a hand. After some time, the right hand also seemed to be detached in the same way. I was told that if he did not get his hands back and they do not return to his body, it is futile-he still trusts in his own power, his own strength. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1373</h4><p>1373. A spirit of this kind was rolled up in such a woolen veil. This took place near me. When he would unroll himself he slipped obliquely down in a long succession, and deeply to the left, towards the lower earth, above the place where, on the other side, are the wood-cutters. He was let down into the depth, and seemed meanwhile to raise himself up by a contrary volution, and to be let down again towards the depth. But it was in vain. <p>1373 1/2. Indeed, his hands appeared detached from the body. First the left hand which stretched upwards, and he complained that he was losing it. After some time the right hand also was seen to be detached in like manner. It was told me that if his hands do not come back again and return to the body, it is futile, for he would still trust in his own power and in his own strength. </p>

Talis quidam involutus erat velo tali laneo, quod factum erat prope me, cumque se evolveret, delabebatur ad sinistrum longa serie, oblique versus terram inferiorem, et profunde, supra locum, ubi lignarii sunt, d alteram partem; demissus est in profundum, seque interea elevare visus, per contravolutionem <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et iterum versus profunditatem, sed incassum.<p>1373a. Imo etiam manus ejus apparebant, quae solutae erant a corpore, sinistra manus primum, quae sursum tendebat, questus quod amitteret manum, post aliquod tempus, etiam videbatur dextra manus similiter [solvi], dictum mihi est, si non recipiat manus suas, et eae <sup>1</sup></p><p>revertantur ad corpus, quod incassum sit, sed usque quod potentiae propriae, seu suis viribus fidat.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has contra volutionem<p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
