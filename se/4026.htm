<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4026</h4><p>4026. Through the whole night I was in a dream about different matters of a material and bodily nature, such as walks, hazardous situations, and the like - and this without any definite sequence. And awakening now and then, I heard angelic choirs, one after another, descending, whom I heard more clearly than usual. I realized that there were several evil spirits attacking me, and that angelic choirs had been sent by the Lord for the purpose of warding off their assaults. The choirs seemed to be descending, but what they were speaking of - apart from the typical sound of choirs - I did not understand. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4026</h4><p>4026. During the whole night I was occupied in dreaming of various objects of a material and corporeal kind, as walkings, dangers, and the like, in a confused and rambling way, and upon awaking from time to time, I heard choirs of angels descending one after another, and which I heard more clearly than on various other occasions. I perceived that there were certain evil spirits who infested me, and that the angelic choirs were sent by the Lord, for the purpose of warding off the assaults of such spirits. But what they said I could not understand, nor did I perceive anything but the sound peculiar to such choirs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4026 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4026. Per totam noctem eram in somnio de diversis, quae materialia et corporea erant, ut de ambulationibus, discriminibus, et similibus, et quidem absque certo ordine; et passim evigilatus, audiebam angelicos choros unum post alterum, descendentem, quos clarius audivi, quam alioquin, percepi, quod aliqui essent, qui me infestarent, et quod angelici chori a Domino missi, avertendi conatus malorum causa, descendere chori videbantur, sed quid loquerentur, praeter sonum qualis esse solet chororum, non percepi. </p>
