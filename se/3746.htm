<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3746</h4><p>3746. It was also declared that their abode is near Gehenna, where there are dragons, so that the haunt of dragons is where such spirits are. Therefore they strive ever higher, ascribing all things to the very least to their own wisdom and understanding - which is what dragons properly symbolize. So they were there, even though they appeared on high, and he who was their medium, spoken of earlier [<a href="3742.htm">3742</a>], was cast down there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3746</h4><p>3746. It was farther said, that their abode is near Gehenna, where the dragons are, so that the haunt of dragons is ever where such [spirits] are. They are therefore of lofty aspirations, and ascribe everything, without exception, to their own prudence and intelligence, which is properly signified by dragons. They were therefore there, although they appeared on high, and the subject before spoken of was cast thither. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3746 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3746.
