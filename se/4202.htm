<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4202</h4><p>4202. <sup>1</sup>About auras<p>What the auras of spirits are like that arise from disagreement or agreement, or from differing convictions, is clearly perceived. There flows in a general disagreement, or agreement, or conviction, whereupon all particulars present themselves as confirmations, so that one would never know but that the matter so stands. The stronger the aura of disagreement is, the stronger is the conviction. This was so much the case that I was very often unable to have any other opinion than that something false was true, and something evil was good, such a general power of conviction pervaded the aura, and such a power in all the confirming particulars. For the general is in the very least things, or the least things derive the same nature from the general.</p><p>[2] When such auras were shown to me by colors as if of a gross bundle of sticks, or beams of wood, of a color for the most part vaguely sky blue, then verging to yellowish, this showed how dense the aura is, which first has to be dispersed, surrounded by something luminously yellow, symbolizing an aura of good or of truth, which cannot yet penetrate the aura of convictions. From those bundles or beams it can be realized how great the aura is, and when it diminishes and vanishes, that the falsity is diminishing. 1749, 9 April. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph and 4203 and 4204 are marginally emphasized by a vertical wavy line. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4202</h4><p>4202. CONCERNING SPHERES.<p>The quality of the spheres of spirits as arising from dissent, from consent, and from opposite persuasions, is clearly to be perceived. There flows in a general dissenting, consenting, or persuading principle, and all particulars then present themselves as confirmations, so that it cannot be known but that the truth is what it appears to be. The stronger such a dissenting sphere is, the stronger is the persuasion, so that oftimes I could not otherwise perceive than that the false was the true, and the evil the good. Such a power of persuading is a common or general sphere, and it is such in all the particulars which thus become confirmatory, for the general is in the singulars, or in other words, the singulars derive their nature from the general, with which it is identical. When such spheres were shown me by colors, they appeared gross as if confasciated or interwoven together like the rafters in a roof. In point of color, they were for the most part of dim asure, afterwards verging to yellowish, - from which it appears how great is the density of such a sphere, that has first to be dissipated - and round about something luminously yellow, signifying the sphere of goodness and truth, which, however, is not able to penetrate the sphere of persuasions. From such swathings or roofings the quantity so to speak, of the sphere may be noted, and how accordingly falsity is diminished in proportion as they are diminished and vanish away. - 1749, April 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4202 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4202. De sphaeris<p>Quales sphaerae spirituum sunt, oriundae ex dissensu, seu consensu, tum ex persuasionibus aliis, manifeste percipitur, influit commune dissentiens, vel consentiens, vel persuadens, et omnia particularia tunc sistunt se ut confirmantia, ut nequaquam aliter sciatur, quam quod ita se habeat: quo fortior dissentiens sphaera, eo fortior persuasio, adeo ut saepius nusquam aliter sentire potuerim, quam quod falsum esset verum, et malum esset bonum, talis vis persuadendi communis in sphaera, et talis est in omnibus particularibus, sic confirmantibus, nam commune est in singulis, seu singula trahunt suam naturam eandem a communi. Cum tales sphaerae, ostensae mihi per colores crassae quasi fasciae, seu tigna, colore ut plurimum obscure coeruleo, tum flavescente, ex quibus constat, quanta densitas sphaera, quae prius dissipanda, et circumcirca aliquid luminosum flavum, significans sphaeram boni vel veri, quae nondum per sphaeram persuasionum penetrare potest, ex talibus fasciis aut tignis, animadverti potest, quanta sphaera, et cum diminuuntur, et evanescunt, quod diminuatur falsitas. 1749, 9 April. </p>
