<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3186</h4><p>3186. About those deceitful ones who do not care for inward things<p>About those who do not care for inward things, discussed earlier, nos. 1177 to 1189, for reasons discussed there: some of those who were more deceitful craftily sneaked into the company of angelic spirits, so that before the angelic spirits knew it, they had slipped into their company.<p>This was noticed due to an inanimate, snowy something that was seen round them. So a signal was given to the angelic spirits by means of their mental images, and those who caught it, attempting to withdraw themselves, were then freed from thence, and those who had sneaked in were cast down, and in fact, by a way across the provinces of the body's internal organs- which ones I do not know, but downwards, toward the urinous parts that are below man, between both feet-the deeper, the more urinous, for they love such things. 1748, 17 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3186</h4><p>3186. CONCERNING THOSE DECEITFUL [SPIRITS] WHO DO NOT CARE FOR INTERIOR THINGS. <p>[I spoke] concerning those who do not care for interior things, of whom [mention has been] previously [made] in No. <a href="../se/1177.htm">1177 to 1189</a> (who are of such a character) for reasons there [given]. Certain of those who were of the more deceitful sort, craftily insinuated themselves into the company of angelic spirits, so that the angelic spirits were ignorant [thereof] before they inserted themselves into their companies as was perceived from this, that a certain snowy inanimate [principle] was perceived around; wherefore the proof was given [indicium factum] to angelic spirits by means of the ideas of these [deceitful spirits]: they [who] perceived this, but endeavored to steal away: hence also were liberated, and it was insinuated unto them, [were] cast down, yea by a way across the provinces of the viscera of the body, with which [provinces] I was not acquainted, still downwards, to the urinous [things] which are beneath man, between each foot; the deeper, the more urinous; for they love such things. - 1748, September 17. </p>
