<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4818</h4><p>4818. A spirit may appear present where another is.<p>How thoughts conjoin spirits was shown, and that the thought of one flowing into another produces a presence there, and that the spirit himself is there. This was shown by many examples. There was a spirit who was very far away. By the inflow of his thought into others, he seemed to himself to be present there. This happened at a great distance when, in fact, he was very far away from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4818</h4><p>4818. THAT TO HIMSELF A SPIRIT MAY APPEAR PRESENT WHERE ANOTHER IS.<p>It was shown how thoughts conjoin, and that the thought of one inflowing into another, produces [the former's] presence where the latter is; yea, that it is [the former spirit] himself. This was shown by many examples: one, who was very remote in place, seemed to himself by influx of thought into others, present where they were, thus at a considerable distance [from where he was]; when, yet, he was really very remote from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4818 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4818. Quod spiritus praesens sibi appareat ubi alius<p>Ostensum est, quomodo cogitationes conjungunt, et quod cogitatio unius influens in altero, sistat praesentiam ibi, tum quod ipse sit, hoc per exempla plura ostensum est, qui in loco erat remotissime, is per influxum cogitationis in alios, videbatur sibi praesens ibi, sic ad multam distantiam, cum tamen esset remotissimus ab illis. </p>
