<p>572.关于木星居民续。他们的善灵很想叫我不要公布我从他们那里所听到的任何事，因为在他们当中，除了他们最亲密的朋友、配偶，以及孩子和父母外，在他们的家庭之外泄露灵人所说的话是被禁止的，会受到惩罚。1)但我回答他们说，地球上的情况不是这样，灵人和天使并不与世人说话，世人也听不见灵人在说什么，因为他们的思维沉浸在世俗和肉体事物中；他们具有这样的性质：凡感官理解不了的东西，他们都不信；因此，许多人甚至不信灵人和天使的存在，因而不信天堂和死后生命的存在，更不信独一主掌管所有事物和所有人。他们更不理解这些事实，因为他们根据外在感官的观念进行判断，而这些观念是如此有限、肉体和物质化，以致他们对这类事一无所知，而是把它们掩盖在黑暗中，从而陷入怀疑，这使得他们从内心否认。2)事实上，如今许多人甚至不相信我所看到和听到关于另一个星球上的人的这些事，而是把它们卷入各种表象中，称其为幻觉；而且他们若敢，甚至会把他们在圣言中所读到的任何东西都称为幻觉。所以他们就是不信的人！因此，我还不知道他们内心会怎么想这些事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 572</h4><p>572. Continuation on the inhabitants of Jupiter<p>Their good spirits were anxious that I should not publish anything I have heard from them, for among them it is forbidden, and punishable, to divulge what spirits speak to any outside of their family - thus except to closest friends and married partners, and children to their own parents.<p>1. ) But I replied to them that on this earth, the situation is different in that spirits and angels do not speak with people, nor do people hear what a spirit is saying, because their thoughts are immersed in worldly and bodily concerns. And it is their nature not to believe anything the senses do not grasp, so that many do not even believe there are spirits and angels, thus that there is a heaven, or a life after death, still less that the one only Lord rules all things and all people - these facts they comprehend all the less because they judge from the ideas of the outer senses, which are so limited, corporeal and material, that they grasp nothing of that kind, but cloak it all in darkness, and consequently in doubts, causing people to deny inwardly.<p>2. ) In fact today, even these things that have been seen and heard by me concerning people on another earth, many do not believe, but roll up in various wrappings, calling them fantasies; and if they dared, they would even call fantasies anything they read in their holy Word - so unbelieving they are! So what they will have thought about these matters among themselves, I do not yet know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 572</h4><p>572. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF JUPITER <p>Their good spirits were solicitous that I should not publish what I heard from them, for with them it is forbidden under penalty to publish what spirits say, except to those who are their most intimate friends, and to their consorts, and also children to their parents, but not outside their family. <p>(1) But I replied, that on this earth there is a different state, namely, that spirits and angels do not speak with men, nor do the latter hear what a spirit says, for their thoughts are immersed in mundane and corporeal things, and they are such, that what they do not apprehend by their senses, they believe to be nothing; so that very many do not even believe that there are spirits and angels, thus that there is a heaven and a life after death, still less that the One Only Lord governs all things, and all men. They comprehend these things the less because they judge from the ideas of the external senses which are so finite, corporeal and material, that they comprehend nothing about such matters, but involve them all in darkness, consequently in doubts, which cause them inwardly to deny. <p>(2) Even now, many do not even believe these things that have been seen and heard by me concerning those in another planet, but involve them in various appearances, calling them phantasies; and, if they dared, they would also call whatever they read in their holy Word phantasies. Thus they are unbelievers; wherefore what they will think about these things within themselves I do not yet know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 572 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>572. Continuatio de Jovis incolis<p>Eorum boni spiritus solliciti erant, ne quid vulgarem, ex iis, quae audivi, nam penes eos vetitum sub poenis vulgare ea quae spiritus loquuntur, nisi amicissimi sint, tum conjuges, ac liberi ad suos parentes, non autem extra eorum familiam; sed iis respondebam, quod in hac tellure alius status sit, nempe quod spiritus et angeli cum hominibus non loquantur, nec quod audiant quid spiritus loquitur, quia immersae sunt eorum cogitationes mundanis et corporeis, suntque tales ut quae non sensus capiant, nihil credant, sic quod plerique ne quidem credant quod spiritus ac angeli, sic quod non coelum ac vita post mortem sit, minus quod Dominus unicus regat omnia et omnes, quod eo minus comprehendunt, quia ex sensuum externorum ideis judicant, quae tam finitae, corporeae et materiales sunt ut nihil comprehendant de talibus, sed involvant omnia tenebris, proinde dubiis, quae faciunt, ut intus <sup>1</sup></p><p>negent; imo nunc, quod haec quae visa et audita a me sint, de iis in altera tellure, plures ne quidem credant, sed involvunt variis speciebus, vocantque phantasias, ac si ausi essent, etiam quicquid in eorum Verbo sancto legunt, etiam phantasias vocarent, ita increduli sunt, quare quid ad haec cogitaverint inter se, nondum scio.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript intime in intus emendatum </p>
