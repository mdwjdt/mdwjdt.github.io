<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5826</h4><p>5826. The Dutch. They are rather clear-sighted, but remain in their own doctrine, not retreating from it unless proven completely wrong. And if they are proven wrong in matters of faith, still they turn their backs, unwilling to retreat. They excel in judgment from a native discernment, from which light they consider matters in the world and in business dealings quite correctly. In the other world their light appears rather dim because their spiritual element is immersed in what is natural due to their thought being constantly on business. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5826</h4><p>5826. The Dutch. These are very penetrating, but they adhere to their own doctrine, not receding unless they are fully convinced; and if convinced in matters of faith, they still turn the back, unwilling to recede. They excel in judgment from natural light [lumen], from which they estimate affairs in the world and in business, very accurately. Their light [lux] in the other life appears more obscure, because their spiritual is immersed in the natural. The reason is, because their thought is constantly in business. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5826 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5826. Hollandi, quod sint satis perspicaces, sed permaneant in sua doctrina, non recedentes nisi prorsus convincantur, et si convincuntur in rebus fidei, quod usque tergum vertant, non volentes recedere; quod valeant judicio ex lumine naturali, ex quo satis juste intuentur res in mundo, et in negotiis, lux eorum in altera vita apparet obscurior, quia spirituale eorum immersum est naturali, causa quia cogitatio eorum continuo est in negotiatione. </p>
