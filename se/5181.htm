<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5181</h4><p>5181. When I was brought there, all the way by changes of state, the spirits who had been around me along the way scattered of themselves as if they did not have the essence of marriage [within them]. One of them still was able to be at the foot of this mountain, but at this point he was discovered and, driven off right up to the outermost boundaries, he fled.<p>They said they live in isolation, with their maids and servants. They are all married. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5181</h4><p>5181. When he was carried to his place, by means of changes of state until his own was reached, then the spirits who were around me on the way, were dispersed of themselves; since they were not in the conjugial [state]. One was still able to be present at the foot of that mountain; but he was immediately discovered, and driven as far as the extreme boundaries, where he fled away. They said that they live by themselves in their own houses, with their maids and menservants, all of whom are in the conjugial [state]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5181 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5181. Cum illuc vectus per mutationes status usque illuc, tunc spiritus qui circa me fuerunt in via dispersi sunt a semet, sicut non in conjugiali erant, unus usque ad pedem montis illius potuit adesse, sed tunc detectus, et usque ad extremos fines adactus aufugit. - Dicebant quod habitent solitarii in suis domibus, cum suis ancillis et servis, qui omnes in conjugio. </p>
