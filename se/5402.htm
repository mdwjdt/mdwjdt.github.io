<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5402</h4><p>5402. After this other women were seen who had practiced whoredom secretly, unknown to others, and who also had been like this to the end of their life in the world. Numbering to thousands, and tens of thousands, they were seen at no real distance from the former ones. These likewise were brought down to the stagnant region on the western side there and were hurled into a gaping, dark cavern there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5402</h4><p>5402. Afterwards, others were seen who, unknown to their associates, have secretly practiced whoredom - who, also, have been such to the end of life in the world. These were seen at no great distance from the former ones, to the number of many thousands and myriads. They, in like manner, were led down to the pond on the western side in that region, and cast into a gloomy, yawning cavern there situated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5402 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5402. Postea aliae visae, quae meretricatum exercuerunt clam, insciis aliis, quae etiam tales fuerant ad finem vitae in mundo, illae visae non ad aliquod spatium ab illis ad plura millia, et myriades, illae similiter deductae sunt ad stagnum ad partem occidentalem ibi, et in cavernam tenebrosam ibi hiantem conjectae. </p>
