<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2194</h4><p>2194. The Lord breaks no one, even in temptations<p>From a great deal of experience I have been allowed to learn that the Lord breaks no one [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_3.htm">Is. 42:3</a>], that is, does not take away a person's desires in a moment, but that He bends them in a wonderful way. For He permits everyone to entertain their passions, so that they may even increase and stretch out to a considerably great extent; and meanwhile, in a marvelous and unbeknown manner, He bends them, by very diverse methods, all depending on the nature and character of the individual.<p>This I have been allowed to learn from a great deal of experience. And, to be sure, He does this pliantly, as if yielding to their freedom, yet not permitting them more than will allow Him to turn them aside from the extreme to which they have been carried away, toward their own good. How this takes place, and how cautiously and with Divine prudence, can be known to no one but him who is allowed to learn it from spirits and angels by experience. What different desires are imparted at that time, to temper his desires, what good feelings they are bent into, I could certainly discern very roughly, but no one knows but the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2194</h4><p>2194. THAT THE LORD DOES NOT BREAK ANY ONE, NOT EVEN [nec] DURING TEMPTATIONS. <p>It has been granted me to learn by much experience that the Lord does not break any one, namely, by taking away in a moment his cupidities; but that he bends them in a wonderful manner, for he permits them to be in their cupidities, yea, even so that these are increased and extended to quite a great degree, and meanwhile, wonderfully and insensibly bends them by the most diverse modes, according to each one's nature and disposition, as was given me to learn by much experience, and moreover [that this occurs] slowly, as if by complying with their license, but still by giving no farther permission than that he may deflect them from the degree to which they have advanced to their own good. How this matter is, and with what caution and divine prudence [effected], no one can know but he to whom it is given to learn it by experience from spirits and angels; for what other cupidities are then also insinuated that may temper, and what good affections which they are to be bended, I could apprehend in a very imperfect manner [rudissime]; but no other than the Lord knoweth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2194 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2194. Quod Dominus neminem frangat, nec in tentationibus<p>A multa experientia discere mihi datum est, quod Dominus neminem frangat, nempe quod [non] momento auferat ejus cupiditates, sed quod flectat eas mirabiliter, permittit enim ut sint in cupiditatibus suis, imo etiam ut augeantur, et intendantur, ad gradum satis magnum, ac interea mirabiliter et insensibiliter flectat, diversissimis mediis, secundum cujusvis naturam ac indolem, quod ab experientia multa discere mihi datum, et quidem lente, quasi obsecundando eorum licentiae, sed usque non amplius permittendo, quam ut ex gradu, in quem evectae sunt, deflectat in eorum bonum; quomodo hoc se habet, et quam caute, et Divina prudentia, nemo scire potest, nisi [is] cui <sup>1</sup></p><p>id ex spiritibus et angelis per experientiam discere datur; quae enim aliae cupiditates tunc quoque insinuantur, quae temperent, et quae affectiones, bonae, in quas flectendae, appercipere quidem rudissime potui, sed, non alius quam Dominus, novit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
