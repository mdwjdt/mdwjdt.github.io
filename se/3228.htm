<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3228</h4><p>3228. Afterwards, when he had become almost as before and the little inward one had been joined to him, this murderer, because he had been spirited in the life of the body and had aspired to perhaps the highest dignities, was told that he knew the punishment proscribed by the laws of the earth for those who perpetrate such things-that they would be buried among their like in a profane place. And he was asked, if someone else had committed such a crime, and he were to judge him, what kind of a judgment would he pass? He said that he would be among those most severe judges, and would therefore condemn him. So he condemned himself. 1748, 21 Sept. </p>

Afterwards that assassin, when he again became nearly such as he was before, and the little interior [spirit] joined to him, inasmuch as he was courageous [high-minded] in the life of the body, and had aspired to dignities perhaps the highest; he was told that he knew their punishment according to the laws of earth; that they who perpetrate such things were buried within such [a spot in a profane place]; and it was said to him if anyone had committed such [a crime], and he should judge him, what sort of judgment would he pass; he said that he would be one of the sternest [maxime serios] judges, and would so condemn him: wherefore he condemned himself. - 1748, September 21. </p>
