<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2571</h4><p>2571. Nor can those inward spirits be where good inward spirits are, any more than people in the world who cannot be together because their intentions are opposite. That they are able to be together in the world is only so that they can employ their plundering tricks to make off with their goods, or use them as servants.<p>In the other life it is different. When good spirits are at hand, they absolutely have to flee away, being almost bored to exhaustion, for there they cannot profit from them. That they cannot be together is shown only by this, that if angels look into them, those spirits are affected with such anguish that they seem to perish, and seem to themselves to turn into filthy reptiles and wild animals. So the Lord disposes things in such a way that they cannot breathe poisonous evil into the faithful. 1748, 8 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2571</h4><p>2571. Nor can these interior spirits be where there are good interior spirits, - in like manner neither in the world can they be together, for their intentions are contrary. That they can be together in the world is only that they may take away their goods by their depredations, or artifices, or use them for servants. It is different in the other life: when good spirits are present, they must needs certainly flee, because they are, as it were, killed with tedium, for there they cannot make gain out of them. That they are unable to be together is apparent merely from this, that if angels work into such, they are affected with such anguish that they seem to perish, and seem to themselves to be turned into loathsome reptiles and wild beasts. Wherefore, the Lord so disposes that they are unable to breathe evil or poison into the faithful. - 1748, July 8. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2571 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2571. nec possunt ii spiritus interiores esse ubi sunt spiritus interiores boni, sicut nec in mundo, qui simul esse nequeunt, nam contrariae sunt intentiones; quod simul possint esse in mundo, est solum ut eorum bona diripiant suis depraedationibus seu artificiis, iisve utantur ut servis; in altera vita aliter, quando boni spiritus adsunt, fugere omnino debent, quia quasi taedio enecantur, nam ab iis lucrari ibi nequeunt; quod simul esse nequeant, constare potest solum ab eo, quod si angeli inspiciant in tales, tali angustia afficiantur, ut perire videantur, vertique sibi videantur in foeda reptilia, et feras; quare Dominus ita disponit, ut nequeant malum seu venenum inspirare fidelibus. 1748, 8 Julius. </p>
