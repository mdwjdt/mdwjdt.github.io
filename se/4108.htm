<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4108</h4><p>4108. Others who had come among them and were evil, were unable to remain with them without suffering distress, as I heard from certain ones who were not able to be with them, for polite behavior moved them, as it had done in the world, and they did not want to show themselves as evil, and as happens in the world when someone has a good opinion of an evil person, that person cannot but show himself as such. So because their inward character still shines forth in the other life, they suffer distress, and separate themselves, wanting to be evil, but not daring. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4108</h4><p>4108. Others who were evil upon coming among them could not remain there, because they were put in pain, as I heard from certain ones that they could not be there, as civil things affected them unpleasantly, just as they did in the world, and thus they showed themselves evil. They were very averse to that kind of companionship. In like manner in the world when anyone has a good opinion of a bad man, he [the latter] cannot well refrain from appearing accordingly; wherefore as their interiors are fully disclosed in the other life, they are pained and thus separate. They are prompted to act out their evil, but dare not. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4108 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4108. Alii cum venirent apud eos, qui mali, non potuerunt ibi esse, quin angerentur, sicut audivi a quibusdam, quod ibi non esse possent, nam civilia eos afficiebant, sicut in mundo, et quod ostenderent se malos, non volebant, sicut in mundo, cum aliquis opinionem boni de malo habet, tunc non potest quin se ostendat ita, quare quia interiora eorum usque elucent in altera vita, anguntur, et se inde separant, volunt mali esse, sed non audent. </p>
