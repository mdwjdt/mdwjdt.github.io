<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 729</h4><p>729. Afterwards I talked with a robber who spoke with a deep voice, like a giant, and I asked him who he was. He said he was looking for plunder to carry off. I asked where he stored his loot, and whether he realized that it would be taken away from him, since it was nothing but an illusion.<p>When I asked him where he was, he said that he was in a desert, or in deserted places, seeking opportunities to plunder, and that those whom he comes upon, he torments in the manner described. Thus the robbers were together [with the others]. He finally acknowledged that he was a spirit; yet still, because he is with me, he does not realize it, thinking he is still living on earth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 729</h4><p>729. I later spoke with a certain robber, asking him who he was. He spoke with a deep voice like a giant, and said that he was seeking plunder that he might carry it away. I asked where he would store his plunder, and whether he knew that those things would be taken away from him, because they are nothing but phantasies. I also asked where he was. He said that he was in a desert, or desert places, seeking booty, and those he met he tortured in this manner so that they might be robbers together. At length he acknowledged that he was a spirit; but, because he is with me, he does not as yet know it, for he supposes that he is still living on the earth. </p>
