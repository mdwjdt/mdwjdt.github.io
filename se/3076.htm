<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3076</h4><p>3076. Sometimes those being thought about are there in a moment<p>Often I have observed that the moment someone is thought about, he is there at once, and in fact in his own place for the most part. I have seen the reason, which is that he is then all at once taken out of the society he is in, into the society where I was, or where he who is thinking of him was. Thus he comes then from his own society into another, but as soon as the thinking ceases, he returns into his society. He is not aware of this, and is surprised at being there so suddenly. 1748, 6 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3076</h4><p>3076. THAT SOMETIMES THOSE, CONCERNING WHOM IT IS THOUGHT, ARE IN A MOMENT PRESENT. <p>It was often observed, that as soon as it is thought concerning anyone, he is immediately present, yea, in the thinker's [suo] place, as far as can be. I perceived the reason [to be] that then he is immediately borne away from the society, wherein he is, to the society that is thinking, in which I might be, or he might be, so that from his society he then comes into another; but as soon as the thinking ceases, he returns to his society; he is ignorant thereof and wonders that he is so suddenly present. - 1748, September 6. </p>
