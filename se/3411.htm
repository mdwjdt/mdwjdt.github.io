<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3411</h4><p>3411. I desired to know where such spirits came from, not wanting them to be from our earth. He said that he was from the stars, others saying he was a cannibal. I spoke with spirits about them, and it was shown that they were indeed such, and also about the nature of their delight when they are killing and want to eat a human being, which delight was great; also, that such have existed, so they are thus called, <sup>1</sup>but I did not know whether such people still live, and whether the Kalmyks are such.<p>I was instructed that they could scarcely be from any other earth than this earth, on which they hold one another in such deadly hatred that they not only treat others most cruelly, but also, once the hatred has come into action, that the cruelty unleashed would easily extend itself to that extreme, as with the cannibals (I also spoke about the Jews, that they hold Christians in such deadly hatred - whether it is true I do not know, but it has been reported [to be the case] at Prague) - in fact, that nothing is more enjoyable to them than human blood, and that some of them in their insane, furious anger are such that they would also desire to eat them in their fury.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1, I. e., anthropophagi, Greek for "eaters of human beings." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3411</h4><p>3411. I wished to know whence such come; for I did not wish that they should be from our earth. He said, that he was from the stars; others said that he was a cannibal; concerning whom I spoke with spirits, and it was shown that they were of such a character: moreover the nature of their delight when they kill man and wish to eat him, which delight was great; also that such have lived; wherefore they are so denominated; but I am unawares whether such still live; thus whether the Calmucks are of such a character. I was informed that such [persons] can hardly go forth from any other world than this, wherein they hold each other in such deadly hatred, that not only do they most cruelly treat others, but when the actuality once comes into play, that easily does the cruelty there let loose, extend itself as amongst the cannibals. I also spoke concerning the Jews, that they hold Christians in such a deadly hatred; whether true I know not, but it is reported that [such is the case] at Prague - yea, that nothing is more pleasant to them than human blood; also that some are possessed by such insane anger or fury, as even to desire to feed on such things in [their] fury. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3411 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3411. Volebam scire unde tales, non enim volebam quod essent e nostra tellure, is dicebat, quod esset ex astris, alii dicebant quod esset anthropophagus, de quibus loquutus cum spiritibus, et ostensum quod tales essent, tum quoque qualis eorum delectatio, cum hominem interficiunt, et comedere volunt, quae delectatio erat magna; tum quod tales vixerint, quare ita vocati, sed nesciebam, num tales adhuc vivant, sic num Calmucki {a} tales sint; instructus quod ab alia tellure vix possent exire, quam ab hac tellure, in qua unus alterum tanto odio internecino habent, ut non solum crudelissime tractent alios, sed etiam cum actualitas exstitit, semel, quod illuc facile crudelitas relaxata, extenderet se, sicut apud anthropophagos; de Judeis quoque loquutus, quod tali internecino odio habeant Christianos, num verum non scio, sed relatum est, quod Pragae: imo quod iis nihil jucundius quam sanguis humanus, tum quod quidam tales sint in insana sua ira seu furore, ut quoque talibus vesci cuperent, in furore. </p>
