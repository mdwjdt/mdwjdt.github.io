<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2342</h4><p>2342. About a restful state, and the enkindled anger of evil spirits<p>I had been brought into a restful state after a deep afternoon sleep, and on awakening I felt a wave-like motion near my feet, which was trying to rise up, but could not, no doubt because I had been brought into a restful state, that is, among those who are in a restful state and perceive the gang of spirits underneath them as a turbulent ocean.<p>I was kept in that state for almost a whole hour, and am still being kept in it, and I felt at the time as if the spirits around me were in a tumultuous rage, attempting to shake me out of that state, making every effort, as they even declared. So they tried out various tests to upset me, to enter into my will and stir up thoughts to disquiet me, as they had at times been allowed to do. Then, with the least provocation, over something that was of no consequence, they would want and try to stir up the greatest trouble. All this I was also made aware of. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2342</h4><p>2342. CONCERNING A STATE OF QUIET AND ANGER [excandescentioe] OF EVIL SPIRITS. <p>I was reduced to a state of quiet after a deep sleep in the afternoon; when I awoke, I perceived, as it were, an undulating principle about the feet, which endeavored to rise, but could not, doubtless because I was thus reduced to a state of quiet, i.e. was among those who are in a quiet state, and perceive under themselves a crowd [confusion] of spirits like a troublous sea - I was kept in that state nearly an entire hour, and am still kept therein - and I then perceived spirits around me as it were in tumultuous anger, endeavoring to throw me [deturbare] out of that state, and attempting it with every endeavor [conatus] which also they said, thus that they attempted with various endeavors to discompose me, and enter into my will and excite thoughts which disturb quiet. Sometimes it was allowed then from the slightest cause of no moment, they wished and endeavored to excite the greatest confusion [turba]. This also, was granted me to recognize [observe]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2342 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2342. De statu quietis, et excandescentiae spirituum malorum<p>In statum quietis redactus sum, post gravem somnum post meridiem, cum expergefactus percipiebam sicut undulans circa pedes, quod assurgere conabatur, sed non potuit, absque dubio, quod sic in statum quietis redactus, h.e. inter eos qui in statu quietis sunt, et subter se percipiunt spirituum turbam, sicut mare turbulentum; in statu illo tenebar fere per integram horam, et adhuc teneor; ac percepi tunc spiritus circum me quasi in ira tumultuosa, conantes me ex statu isto deturbare, et omni conatu id tentantes, quod etiam dicebant, sic ut tentarent <sup>1</sup></p><p>vario conatu me perturbare, ac intrare in voluntatem meam, et excitare cogitationes, quae perturbant quietem, [quod] aliquoties iis concessum erat, tunc et minima causa, quae nullius momenti erat, maximam turbam volebant et conabantur excitare, quod quoque cognoscere mihi dabatur. </p>
