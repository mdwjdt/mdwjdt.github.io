<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 816</h4><p>816. For this reason, when souls are let into heaven, or into other regions pleasing to him, one cannot judge from this that they are to be angels and more acceptable than others, as it is commonly supposed. But because all things take place by permission and consent, they are therefore sent back, as it were, to the spirits, so that the spirits may find out as if on their own, secretly or openly, what [these souls] are like, and more or less judge about them in their own way. Nevertheless, all these circumstances are governed by the Lord. 1748, 16 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 816</h4><p>816. When, therefore, a soul is admitted into heaven or into other places agreeable to him, it cannot thence be concluded that they will become angels and be more acceptable than others, as is commonly believed. But because all things take place by permission and with leave, they are therefore apparently sent back to spirits, so that these spirits may find out as of themselves, either covertly or openly, of what quality they are, and may judge, as it were, in their own way concerning them. But still all these things are ruled by the Lord. 1748, Feb. 16. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 816 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>816. Quare dum anima admittitur in coelum, seu in alia ei grata, non inde judicari potest, quod futuri sint angeli, et aliis acceptiores, ut vulgo opinantur, sed quia omnia permissive fiunt, et cum venia, ideo remittuntur quasi ad spiritus, ut ii quasi ex se clam aut manifeste inveniant quales sint, sic ut quasi judicent suo modo de iis, sed usque omnia haec reguntur a Domino. 1748, 16 Febr. </p>
