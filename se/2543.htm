<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2543</h4><p>2543. Moreover, there was also conversation about the body, to the effect that the body is nothing except the use that it performs to its spirit in the world, being something entirely separate from its spirit, and that the body, of which they take such great care, is nothing. For every beast and wild animal, in fact every little insect, has an even more neatly composed and more perfect body than the human, more perfect organs of smell, taste, sight-indeed, that little insects among the foliage see tinier things and smell much more keenly the elements of finer nature than mankind can ever see by the most refined microscope or feel by any technique. For they see their foods, smell them, and taste things that do not stir the slightest human sensation. So the brutes have more perfect bodies than humans, who nevertheless take such great care and have such great love for that body that in itself is so vile. 1748, 6 July. </p>

Besides also there was discourse concerning the body, that the body is nothing except [as regards] the use which it performs for its spirit, in the world, is something wholly separate from its spirit; and that the body, for which they have so much care, is nothing; for every beast and wild animal, even the smallest insect, has a still nicer and more perfect body than man, more perfect organs of smell, taste, sight; yea, that the insects in the leaves see more minute things, and smell [scent] much more acutely [purius] those things that are in subtler nature than ever man can see with the subtlest microscope, or feel by art. For they see their food, smell it, and taste things that do not reach the slightest sensation of man. Wherefore [the] bodies of brutes are more perfect than man's, and yet [men] have so much care and so much love for such a body as in itself is so vile. - 1748, July 6. </p>

Praeterea quoque de corpore sermo fuit, quod corpus sit nihil praeter usum quem praestat spiritui suo in mundo, sit quoddam separatum prorsus a spiritu ejus; et quod corpus, cujus tantam curam habent [homines], sit nihili, nam unaquaevis bestia et fera <sup>1</sup></p><p>, imo insectulum, adhuc concinnius et perfectius corpus habet ac homo, perfectiora organa olfactus, gustus, visus, imo quod insectula in foliis videant minutiora <sup>2</sup></p><p>, et olfaciant multo purius ea quae in subtiliori natura sunt, quam usquam homo microscopio subtilissimo videre possit, aut arte sentire; nam vident eorum cibos, odorantur eos, et sapiunt, quae ad minimam sensationem hominis non perveniunt, quare corpora perfectiora sunt brutis, quam homini, et usque tantam curam, et tantum amorem talis corporis, quod in se tam vile est, habent. 1748, 6 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has ferra<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has minitiora </p>
