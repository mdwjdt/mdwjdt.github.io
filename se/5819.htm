<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5819</h4><p>5819. <sup>1</sup>All those who in the world had acknowledged the Lord's Divinity and lived morally were preserved in heaven, especially those who had acknowledged the Divine Human; but the rest who had not acknowledged the Lord's Divinity. Most people who had, had thought of the Lord as nothing other than a common person, were sent down from heaven and thrown down. Many who had not wanted to acknowledge the Lord's Divinity in the world, wanted to do so in the other life, but in vain. They did it with the mouth, but not the heart.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Paragraphs 5817 and 5818 are missing in the original manuscript. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5819</h4><p>5819. <sup>1</sup>All those who, in the world, acknowledged the Lord's Divine and lived well, especially those who acknowledged the Divine Human, were preserved in heaven. But the rest, who did not acknowledge the Lord's Divine, and for the most part thought of the Lord no otherwise than as of an ordinary man, were let down from heaven and cast down. Many who did not acknowledge the Lord's Divine in the world, wished to acknowledge it in the other life, but in vain. They did it with the mouth, but not in heart. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The numbering is the same as in the original, where 5817 and 5818 are missed out. -TR. </p>

Multi voluerunt agnoscere Divinum Domini in altera vita, qui non agnoverunt in mundo, sed incassum, ore fecerunt et non corde.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;5817-5818 desunt </p>
