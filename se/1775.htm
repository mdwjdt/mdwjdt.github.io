<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1775</h4><p>1775. About the sensation with spirits that their bodies live<p>The spirits of this earth have such a strong impression that they live in the body that it is hardly believable, and they can hardly be convinced otherwise. I have shown them by various methods that this is fantasy, and they finally acknowledged it, but still relapsed into the same fantasies. This is why their mind remains for a long time after death in the body, and it is also the reason that when spirits from the planet Jupiter who are averse to bodies are nearby, a great uneasiness arises on both sides. 1748, 29 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1775</h4><p>1775. CONCERNING THE IMPRESSION WITH SPIRITS THAT THEIR BODIES LIVE. <p>The spirits of this our earth have such an impression in regard to their still living in the body as will scarcely be credited, and it is with the utmost difficulty that they can be persuaded to the contrary. I pointed out to them in various ways that that was a phantasy, so that they at length acknowledged it, but they still fell back into similar phantasies, wherefore their mind remains a long time after death in the body [so to speak], which is also the cause that when spirits from the earth Jupiter are present, who have an aversion to bodies, an extreme uneasiness arises [and is felt] on both sides. - 1748, March 29. </p>

De impressione apud spiritus, quod corpora eorum vivant<p>Talem impressionem habent spiritus hujus telluris, quod corpore, vivant, ut vix credi possit, et ii vix persuaderi [possint], quod aliter se habeat, iis <sup>1</sup></p><p>per varia monstravi, quod id phantasia esset, tandem agnoverunt, sed usque redierunt in similes phantasias, quare animus eorum post mortem adhuc diu manet in corpore, quae etiam causa est, quod dum spiritus ex tellure Jovis prope adsunt, qui aversantur corpora, quod anxietas multa suboriatur utrinque. 1748, 29 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
