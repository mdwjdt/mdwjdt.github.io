<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2975</h4><p>2975. On someone amazed over the countless varieties existing in the other life<p>There were some present who were upright, but had never thought about how heaven is, imagining like others that heaven was just simple. But when they were asked whether they would not aver that more varieties of everything exist in the other life than in the world, and more societies, and more things than a person on earth ever thinks-then on being gifted with reflection, they began to marvel that they had thought about nothing but joy, but that they had never thought about the existence of countless varieties making up societies. 1748, 29 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2975</h4><p>2975. CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO WONDERED THAT INDEFINITE VARIETIES ARE GIVEN IN THE OTHER LIFE. <p>Certain were present, who were upright, but have never thought of heaven, supposing like others, that heaven is as it were a simple thing [simplex]: but when it was said to them, whether they imagined that no more varieties of all are given in the other life, than in the world, and whether there are no societies, and more things than man ever thinks, then, reflection being given them, they began to wonder, that they have thought of nothing but joy, but have never thought of the indefinite varieties [proceeding] from societies. - 1748, August 29. </p>
