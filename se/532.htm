<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>532.关于木星居民续。一个与我同在的木星灵变得疲惫，渴望自己人的陪伴，厌恶我们地球灵，因为他们想要欺骗他，把他引向违背信仰和真理的东西。这个灵人还说，在他所住的那片土地上，人口数量和这个星球所能养活的一样多，并补充说，那里土地肥沃，富有万物。由于所有人都过着没有贪婪的生活，只求养活自己，所以可以断定：那里必有大量人口。（1748年1月24日至25日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 532</h4><p>532. Continuation about the inhabitants of Jupiter<p>The one who had been with me was becoming weary, longing for the company of his own people and turning away from those spirits who are from our earth because they were trying to deceive him and lead him astray toward things contrary to belief and truth.<p>This spirit also said that in the part of his earth where he had been, there was as great a number of people as the land could nourish, adding that the ground is fertile, abounding in all things. Therefore, since all live without greed, seeking only to be nourished, one can infer that there must be a multitude of people. 1748, the 24th or 25th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 532</h4><p>532. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF JUPITER <p>The spirit [of Jupiter] who was with me grew weary and desired the companionship of his fellows, being averse to the spirits of our earth because they wanted to deceive him, and to lead him to those things that are contrary to faith and truth. He also said that in the part of his earth where he had been, the multitude of men was as great as the earth could nourish, and that the earth was fertile, abounding in all things. Since they all live without avarice, seeking only to be nourished, it can thence be concluded what a great multitude there must be. 1748, Jan. 24-25. </p>
