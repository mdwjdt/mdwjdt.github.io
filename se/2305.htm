<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2305</h4><p>2305. <sup>1</sup># When some [recently arrived] soul, or some spirit, comes among others, there are at once several who are carried away by the desire to examine them, and to find out what they are like, so they examine them in various ways. Then there are also many who think about hardly anything else but finding something evil, so that they can attack, reprove and punish them. Many are carried away by that burning desire, and are almost like executioners, even though in bodily life no such thing was suspected of them.<p>Now when they are examining, the Lord only permits what He wishes to come forth from their thoughts and in their thoughts. For if all the evil and filthy things were to come out that are part of their thoughts and in their thoughts, they could not possibly survive, but would be torn to pieces as if by ferocious dogs. So the Lord allows only those things to come forth from and in their mental images that can be corrected, but cannot be corrected without chastening punishment. So all permissions, punishments, and forms of purging, are for the sake of a good outcome. 1748, 12 June.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Between 2304 and 2305 in the original, the following incomplete and unnumbered article appears, deleted by crossing lines:<br><br>A person on earth, and a spirit is led by the Lord to good in the measure they have received from the Lord. <br><br>Many spirits complain about their condition, and that they cannot be different. So they undergo purgings, and numerous other things, so that they can. And when the Lord has joined and added to them qualities of true faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2305</h4><p>2305. When any soul or any spirit comes amongst others, there are forthwith many who are carried away by a desire of examining [him] and of knowing what his quality is, therefore they examine him in various manners; then, also, there are many who scarcely think of anything else than to find something of evil, to rush out, chastise, and punish; such is the ardor by which many are carried away, so that they are, as it were, torturers, although in the life of the body no such thing is heard of by them. Then when they examine, the Lord permits only that which [is made up] of their ideas, and in their ideas, to come forth that pleases Him for if all the evil and filthy things which belong to ideas, and are in ideas, should come forth, they could never subsist, but would be, as it were, mangled by swift dogs. Thus the Lord, of these things that are made up of ideas, and are in ideas, permits only those to come forth which are to be reformed, and which are not reformable without the punishment of vastation. Wherefore all permissions, punishments, and species of vastation are for the sake of good. - 1748, June 12. </p>
