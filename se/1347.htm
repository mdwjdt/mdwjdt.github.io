<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1347</h4><p>1347. About a raging gang, or furies<p>There are those who had lived in the world constantly quarreling and thieving, as do very many of the lowest class, thinking nothing about eternal life, but almost always involved in disputes and hostilities, provoking other people, insulting them in one way or another, and causing them harm. They enjoy this life, stealing whenever the chance offers itself. These, as well as those inwardly like them although better behaved because of a different upbringing and a fear of legal penalties, become like furies after death. They appear as nude men or women with their hair strewn about them, and yet their hair is cut all the way around, not streaming down the back, but encircling their head like a mop. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1347</h4><p>1347. CONCERNING THE FURIOUS CREW, OR THE FURIES <p>Those become like furies after death who in the world have lived, as very many of the lowest class have, continually in brawls and thefts, who think nothing about eternal life and consequently have no belief, but live almost constantly in contentions and enmities, provoking others, insulting them in various ways, bringing harm upon them by which they are delighted, and stealing as often as the opportunity occurs. Those also become like furies who are like these inwardly, though better behaved because they have been brought up differently and fear the penalties of the law. They appear naked, both males and females, with their hair flying about them, and yet the hair round about is cut, not hanging down the back, but bound around the head like a broom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1347 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1347. De furiosa turba, seu furiis<p>Qui in mundo vixerunt continuo in rixis, et furtis, sicut ex infima plebe permulti, qui nihil cogitant de vita aeterna, proinde nec credunt, at jugiter fere in contentionibus et inimicitiis vivunt, lacessendo alios, injurgando variis modis, et damnum iis inferendo, quo delectantur, ita furando, quoties occasio datur; tum qui similes iis sunt intus, tametsi moratiores, quia educati aliter, ac timent legis poenas; ii post mortem fiunt sicut furiae, apparent nudi seu nudae, cum circumsparsis comis, et quidem comae circumcirca sunt caesae, non fluentes in tergum, sed circum sicut scopae cingunt caput. </p>
