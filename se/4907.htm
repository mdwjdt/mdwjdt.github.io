<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4907</h4><p>4907. Continuation about the heavens the hells In spirit I was guided the right where the mountains cliffs spoken of [<a href="4894.htm">4894-4895</a>] are eventually also across the top of the bridges down them a little. Those dwell on the rocky cliffs who have goodness produced by faith, in the mountains round about those who have goodness produced by care for others, they are meant by the mountains of Israel. Those higher there are those who are heavenly beings. They are meant by the mount of Zion Jerusalem. </p><p>[2] In the depths there are various hells. Also below and between the rocky places are the hells of those who are vengeful, some of which hells are such that they could not be passed through. When I came near, an almost deadly numbness seized my arms and hands. They failed me, because something lethal emanates from those hells. The hells there are extended lengthwise and differ in nature and number depending on how long and also how deep they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4907</h4><p>4907. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HEAVENS AND THE HELLS.<p>I was conducted, in spirit, to the right, where are the mountains and rocks of which I have spoken above, and, at length, on to the rocks, and, to a small extent, beneath them. In the rocks dwell those who are in the good of faith; in the mountains around, those who are in the good of charity - who are understood by the "mountains of Israel." Higher up, there, are the celestials, who are the "mountain of Zion," and of Jerusalem. In the depths, there, are various hells: under and amongst the rocks are also the hells of those who are in revenge. Some of these hells are of such a character that they cannot be crossed over; and when I approached, a torpor, and as it were deadness, laid hold of my arms and hands; in fact, they failed me, for there exhales from thence a deadly sphere. The hells there are extended lengthwise, and they differ, in quality and quantity, according to distance and also according to depth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4907 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4907. Continuatio de coelis et de infernis<p>Perlatus sum in spiritu ad dextrum, ubi montes et rupes, de quibus supra [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4907/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4894" target=_top>4894-4895</a>], tandem quoque super rupes, et parum infra illas, in rupibus habitant qui in bono fidei, in montibus circum qui in bono charitatis, qui intelliguntur per montes Israelis, superius ibi sunt coelestes, qui sunt mons Zionis et Hierosolymae; in profundis ibi sunt varia inferna; sub rupibus et inter illas sunt quoque inferna illorum qui in vindictis sunt, quorum quaedam tales sunt, ut transiri non potuerint, cumque approximabam hebetudo et quasi necativum occupabat brachia et manus; delinquebant enim, nam inde exhalat lethale; porrecta sunt inferna ibi in longitudinem, et secundum distantiam et quoque secundum profunditatem differunt qualitate et quantitate. </p>
