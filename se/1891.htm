<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1891</h4><p>1891. This is indeed their endeavor in regard to all people, whoever they are, but with this difference, that when they are unable [to gain control], although they are set upon it, they are driven away. With me, however, since they knew that they were spirits, and not people on earth, they could reflect on the matter, for which reason they broke out in open indignation and anger, and this cannot happen openly with others. 1748, 12 April.<p>Good spirits, however, are not allowed to do this. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1891</h4><p>1891. Such are their efforts in regard to men of all classes, but with this difference, that when they are intent upon their object and yet cannot effect it, they are driven away; but with me, inasmuch as they knew that they were spirits and not me, they could reflect upon the matter, wherefore there was a bursting forth into open indignations and hatreds; with others this open outbreak could not take place. - 1748, April 12. <p>With good spirits this course of action is not allowed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1891 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1891. Talis etiam est eorum conatus circa homines quoscunque, sed cum ea differentia, quod cum nequeant, et tamen instent, inde abigantur; penes me autem, quia noverunt, quod spiritus essent, non homines, super id reflectere potuerunt, quare in apertas indignationes et iras erupit: nec aperte potest penes alios. 1748, 12 April. Spiritibus vero bonis non licet. </p>
