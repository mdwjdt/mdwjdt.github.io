<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3017</h4><p>3017. So that I would know how that inexpressible speech of inward spirits differs [from the former, 3015], I was told that the things that come down to good inward spirits are entirely different from what comes down from heaven to evil inward spirits. To make known what that was like which fell through heaven to good inward spirits, a maiden appeared to me when I was awake, who was walking with another, a man, whom I did not see and whom I realized to be her lover. The maiden was seen only from behind, clothed in an ordinary dress of bright yellow, neatly fitted to her about the chest, making the style of the bodice quite pretty; but only her back was shown to my view. Thus are portrayed the things that fall through heaven to upright inward spirits. 1748, 1 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3017</h4><p>3017. (In order that I might know how that inexpressible speech of interior spirits differs [from other speech], it was told me that it is wholly different with what falls among [to] [ad] interior good spirits, and that [this speech] falls from heaven to interior evil spirits; that it might be known of what quality is that which falls [flows] [laberetur] through heaven into interior good spirits. I saw, in wakefulness, a certain virgin, who walked with another [person] or man not seen by me, whom I perceived to be her lover. That virgin was seen only at the back; she was clad in a common garment of light yellow color [albescente flavescente]. This garment was neatly fitted to her about the breast, so that the dress [habitus] of the body was quite comely, but only the back was allowed me to see. Thus are represented those things which flow through heaven into the interior good spirits. - 1748, September 1.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3017 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3017. Ut scirem quomodo differt loquela ista inexpressibilis interiorum spirituum, dictum mihi, quod quae cadunt ad spiritus bonos interiores aliter se prorsus habeant <sup>1</sup></p><p>, ac quod cadit a coelo ad spiritus interiores malos; ut sciretur quale se haberet, quod per coelum in spiritus interiores bonos laberetur, in vigilia mihi visa est virgo quaedam, quae cum alio non mihi viso, seu viro, ambulabat, quem ejus amantem percipiebam esse, virgo ista visa modo a tergo, veste induta albescente a flavescente, communi, quae vestis adpropriata ei erat concinne ad pectorale, sic ut habitus corporis erat satis pulcher, sed modo tergum mihi visendum praebitum, ita repraesentantur ea, quae per coelum in spiritus interiores probos labuntur. 1748, 1 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has habeat </p>
