<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4854</h4><p>4854. About the Hell of the profane<p>The hell of the profane is diametrically beneath humankind, beneath the organs belonging to marriage, at a depth there determined by the degree of [its] profanation and nature. There are very many there today because those come into this hell who have believed the things belonging to heaven and the Church and later inwardly denied them; then there are those who frequently attend all holy rites in keeping with custom and believe and nevertheless live evilly - not, however, those who lived evilly and do not believe.<p>There are, as they said, filthy places there, swamps, barren lands, here and there rocky places with caves, and here and there covered with forests. There are also places where there are snakes of various kinds, besides other wild creatures.<p>They cannot struggle out because as they struggle to get out, which they long to do, they start feeling pain and torment, and so they move off, depending on their sense of discomfort, and there they remain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4854</h4><p>4854. CONCERNING THE HELL OF THE PROFANE.<p>The hell of the profane is diametrically under man, under his conjugial [parts], deep down there according to the degree and quality of the profanation. There are very many there, at this day; for into that hell come those who have believed the things of heaven and of the Church, and afterwards in themselves denied them; also, those who attend on sacred things in compliance with fashion, and believe, and yet live ill; but not those who have lived ill and have not believed. There, as they said, are squalid sights, marshes, sterile grounds here and there, rocky places with caverns, and, besides these, regions overrun with forests. There are also places where are serpents of various kinds, besides other haunts of wild beasts. They cannot force their way out; for if they make the effort, as they desire, they fall into pains and tortures; wherefore they remove themselves afar off according to the sense of unpleasantness, and there they remain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4854 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4854. De Inferno prophanorum<p>Infernum prophanorum est e diametro sub homine, ejus conjugialibus, profunde ibi secundum prophanationis gradum, et quale, ibi hodie sunt perplurimi, nam illi in id infernum veniunt, qui crediderunt illis quae coeli et Ecclesiae, et postea in se negarunt; tunc qui sancta frequentant secundum morem, et credunt, et tamen male vivunt, non autem illi qui male vixerunt et non crediderunt. Ibi, sicut dixerunt, sunt squalores, paludes, steriles terrae, passim pertrosa cum cavernis, et passim illa sylvis obsita, sunt etiam loca ubi serpentes varii generis, tum alia ferina. Non possunt eniti, nam sicut enituntur, quod cupiunt, in dolores et cruciatus veniunt, quapropter se elongant secundum sensum injucundi, et ibi manent. </p>
