<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 647</h4><p>647. Speaking and coaxing are of no avail when the heart is longing, moved by a love<p>Through much experience with spirits, I have learned that persuasion contrary to the feelings is of no avail whatsoever. For very often my heart has been moved by some feeling, and meanwhile, spirits as well as angels would coax, saying that this should be done, and not that; but as long as I was still gripped by that feeling, their coaxing could have no effect whatsoever, as I even told them in response on several occasions.<p>Also this, that if the feeling shifted only a little, then at once my mind was changed, and I would yield to the persuasion. From this and from many actual experiences, I was enabled to learn that all persuasion contrary to one's loves can achieve absolutely nothing.<p>This is the reason why those spirits who are demons, who operate through the passions, are the most dangerous. On the other hand, the angels' way of working is to bend minds toward good through the feelings, the Lord so directing. 1748, 5 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 647</h4><p>647. THAT SPEECH AND PERSUASIONS ARE OF NO AVAIL WHEN THE "ANIMUS" DESIRES OR IS AFFECTED BY LOVE <p>From very considerable experience with spirits I have learnt that persuasions avail nothing whatever against affections. For very often my "animus" has been affected, and in the meanwhile spirits, and also angels, have persuaded and said that something was to be done in such and such a manner, and not otherwise. But so long as I was detained in the affection, persuasions could avail nothing, as also I sometimes told them in reply. If the affection were but bent, then the mind would be changed at once and would follow the persuasion. Hence, as from living experiences and from many things, I could know that all persuasions contrary to the loves can effect nothing whatsoever. Wherefore those spirits who are genii and act through the cupidities are the most dangerous. Furthermore, it is the way of the angels to bend minds to good through the affections, the Lord governing in that way. 1748, Feb. 5. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 647 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>647. Quod loquela et persuasiones, dum animus cupit, seu afficitur amore, nihil valeant <sup>1</sup></p><p>Per plurimam experientiam cum spiritibus, didici, quod persuasiones, contra affectiones nihil quicquam valeant, nam animus affectus est perpluries, ac interea persuaserunt spiritus, tum angeli, loquutique sunt, quod ita agendum, non aliter, sed dum usque detinerer in affectione tunc nihil potuerunt valere persuasiones, quod etiam aliquoties iis respondi; tum id, si modo flecteretur affectio, tunc illico mutaretur mens, persuasionem <sup>1</sup></p><p>obsequuturus, inde ut ex vivis experientiis, et multis potui scire, quod omnes persuasiones contra amores nihil prorsus efficere possint, quare ii spiritus, qui genii sunt, qui per cupiditates agunt, periculosissimi sunt; praeterea etiam angelorum via est per affectiones ad bonum flectere mentes, ita Domino regente. 1748, 5 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
