<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5359</h4><p>5359. After this, the cleansing of the middle space continued in all the cities, and also in provinces, villages, every place of all those who had lived in the Church without the Church, that is, that had religion without religion, by virtue of the fact that they never gave a thought to how they lived, and whatever they did they did on account of themselves, and besides this lived in ease and luxury. Such were hurled into that chasm partly to the north, partly to the west, also into the gulf at the south, besides into deserted places everywhere. This went on for quite a long time. There was an enormous number. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5359</h4><p>5359. Afterwards, the clearing away from the middle space of all the cities, and also of the neighboring mansions, continued. Every spot [was cleared] of all those who have lived in the Church without the Church, or in religion without religion, in that they never regarded the life, and, whatever they did, did all for the sake of self, and, moreover, lived in ease and luxury. Such characters were cast, part of them into the northern chasm, part into the western, some, also, into a chasm in the south, besides into the desert places in every direction. This went on for quite a long time. The number was immense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5359 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5359. Postea perstabat repurgatio spatii medii ex omnibus urbibus et quoque ex provinciis, villis, ubivis omnium illorum qui vixerunt in Ecclesia absque Ecclesia, seu in religione absque religione, per id quod nusquam spectaverint vitam, et quicquid egerunt propter se egerunt, et praeterea vixerunt otio et genio, tales conjecti sunt in hiatus partim septentrionalem, partim occidentalem, etiam in hiatum ad meridiem, praeter in deserta loca ubique; hoc satis diu peractum, ingens numerus. </p>
