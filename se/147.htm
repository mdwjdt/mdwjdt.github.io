<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>147.与一些犹太人谈论永生。他们所期望的永生充满喜乐，起初如同沉睡，然后就是最幸福的状态。当被问及他们是想与自己的同伴一起生活，还是想独自生活时，他们说，他们想在一个大社群里与他们的领袖一起生活。当被问及他们是否愿意与同他们的内在相一致的其他人一起生活时，他们说他们不知道何为内在人。但当有人说，在来世，他们会照着他们的内在与其同伴一起生活，并且由于他们十分清楚彼此的内在本性，也知道他们领袖的内在本性，所以那时他们将活在不和、仇恨和痛苦中时，他们最终承认，他们在等待弥赛亚，弥赛亚会把他们团结在一起。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 147</h4><p>147. A conversation with Jews about eternal life. They expect it to be full of joy, at first like sleep, then the very happiest of all states. When asked whether they wanted to share life with their fellows, or be by themselves, they said, In a large society together with their leaders. Asked whether they wanted to live with the others as they [really] are inwardly, they said they did not know what the inner person is. But then it was told that in the other life they would live with their companions as they are inwardly, and thus (since they well know each other's inward character and also know that of their leaders) that they would live in disharmony, hatred and unhappiness, they finally revealed that they were awaiting the Messiah, Who would unite them [cf. 51a]. See Jews. <sup>1</sup>[Jews; Inward; Society; Lord]<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See Experiences Spirituales, Vol I, p. xxxi, locus 4. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 147</h4><p>147. [A CONVERSATION WITH JEWS CONCERNING ETERNAL LIFE] <p>A discourse with some Jews concerning eternal life, that they expect a life full of joy, first as in sleep, and then the utmost happiness above all others. When asked whether they wanted to live with their companions, or to be by themselves, they said, in a great society with its leaders. Asked whether they wished to live in society with others who are in accord with their interiors, they said they did not know what the internal man is. But when it was said that in the other life they lived with their companions according to their interiors, and that since each one of them was interiorly of a character such as they knew, and that their leaders, as they also knew, were of such a character, they would then live in disharmony, hatred, and unhappiness, they finally confessed that they were awaiting a Messiah who would unite them. (Dominus, Interiora, Fudaei, Societas.) <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This is evidently the passage referred to in WE 2227, written at the end of February or the beginning of March 1746: "Here, if it is pleasing to God Messiah, may be inserted a conversation I had with Jews, with whom I spoke yesterday, and which is described on a separate sheet of paper." </p>
