<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4110</h4><p>4110. Those states often return, and because there are many states, namely, that people had entertained open hatreds, secret hatreds, simulated friendships, and these with much variety, then also other evils, as those pertaining to love of self and of the world, as well as of committing adulteries - all these not only return, but are also manifested to spirits and in front of angels, to their shame and grief. Thus they undergo punishment of not just one kind, but many, and whenever they are exposed as having been of that character, they are subjected to punishments befitting their evil and crime. But still, only one kind of punishment, consequently one hell, awaits them, which is that of their prevailing evil or crime. 1748, 1 Dec. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4110</h4><p>4110. These states return often, and because they are many, as, for instance, in which the man had cherished open or latent enmities, pretended friendships, and so on, they occur with much variety, as also other evils, the indulgence of worldly and selfish love, the commission of adulteries, etc. All these not only return, but are manifested before spirits and angels with shame and grief. He thus undergoes not one kind of punishment, but many; and as often as it occurs, and his character is exposed, he suffers a punishment conformed to his evil and iniquity; but still one general kind of punishment, and consequently one hell remains for him, which is that of his ruling evil and iniquity. - 1748, December 1.</p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4110 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4110. Status isti redeunt saepe, et quia plures status sunt, nempe quod homo aperta odia, occulta odia, simulatas amicitias habuerat, sic cum multa varietate, tum quoque alia mala, ut quae sunt amoris sui et mundi, tum quod adulteria commiserit, omnia haec non solum redeunt, [sed] etiam manifestantur spiritibus et coram angelis, cum pudore et dolore; ita non unius generis poenam, sed plures subit, et toties cum occurrit, et talis fuerit, punitur poenis, quae ejus malo et flagitio conformes sunt: sed usque unum genus poenae, proinde unum infernum manet, quod est ejus mali seu flagitii regnantis. 1748, 1 Dec. </p>
