<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1842</h4><p>1842. Some others also were introduced into that field, so that I would understand what they were like. They were the kind who were trying from their own power to be innocent, which was an angelic field. At that time their state of mind was portrayed to me as a little child, symbolizing innocence, who was throwing up milk out of its mouth. This is the condition that field brings on those who put on innocence, trying to be innocent from their own power. They can tolerate it no more than those stomachs that cannot tolerate milk, when milk is poured into them, and because they cannot stand it, throw it up, just as the stomachs are apt to do of those who have indulged too much intoxicating beverage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1842</h4><p>1842. Others were also admitted into that sphere that I might perceive the result, as, for instance, those who would fain be innocent from themselves; and as the sphere was angelic, their state was represented to me by an infant, signifying innocence which vomited milk from its mouth. Such is the state of those who, in that kind of sphere, simulate innocence, or would fain be innocent from themselves - a character, however, which they no more sustain than do the little stomachs of infants bear to be gorged with milk, which they nauseate and reject, as is the case with the stomachs of those who indulge too much in intoxicating drink. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1842 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1842. In sphaeram illam admissi sunt quoque alii, ut perciperem, qualiter se haberent, ita ii qui volebant ex semet innocentes esse, quia sphaera erat angelica, tunc status eorum mihi repraesentabatur per infantem, quo significabatur innocentia, qui evomebat lac, sic ut ore suo lac evomeret, talis est status eorum, in tali sphaera, qui innocentiam simulant, seu ex se volunt innocentes esse, quod non aliter eam sustineant, ac dum lac in tales ventres infunditur, qui non lac sustinent, sed quia aversantur, evomunt; sicut solent esse ventres eorum, qui nimium indulserunt potui inebrianti. </p>
