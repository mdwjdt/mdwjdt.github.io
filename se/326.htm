<p>326.人类的灵魂，甚至天使能转入属世心智的状态，因而转入自己的情欲，由此也被检查，以揭示当任由他们自己时，他们是何品质。今天和以前一样，我通过活生生的经历被指示，人类的理解力似乎能从人那里被夺走，他的属世之光则留给他；然而，诸如属于属世层的那么多和那种理解的能力会留下来，以使他还可以成为一个人。我通过活生生的经历获知，在这种状态下，死人的灵魂就是魔鬼，并像魔鬼一样犯罪；这一点也通过长期经历得到证明。事实上，还证明，天使也能降至这种状态，从这种状态可以探究他在意愿方面是哪种人。因为那时，他在世时被野心和世间法律所约束的意愿可以说得到释放。然而，弥赛亚神不允许一个圣者自由行动到如此程度，除非为了叫他看见自己的邪恶品质。（1747年12月10日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 326</h4><p>326. Human souls, even angels, can be transferred into the condition of their earthly mind, thus into their yearning desires, and then also be examined, revealing what they are like when left to themselves [see <a href="372.htm">372</a>]<p>Today, as previously [<a href="157.htm">157</a>], I was shown by actual experience that the human ability to understand can seemingly be taken away [from people], leaving them their native discernment and still as much and such ability to understand as nature allots to make them human. And I learned from actual experience that the souls of the dead in that state are then devils, and commit crimes like a devil, which was also shown by extensive experience.<p>In fact, it was even shown that angels can be reduced to that same state, revealing what kind of a person each one had been as to the will. For then it is as if the will, which is reined in in the world by one's ambitions, as well as by the civil law, is set free. However, God the Messiah does not permit a saint to act so freely that he sees his own infernal qualities. 1747, the 10th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 326</h4><p>326. THAT HUMAN SOULS, EVEN ANGELS, CAN BE TRANSMITTED INTO THE STATE OF THEIR NATURAL MIND, THUS INTO THEIR CONCUPISCENCES, AND THEREBY CAN ALSO BE EXPLORED, TO MAKE EVIDENT OF WHAT QUALITY THEY ARE WHEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES <p>Today, as before, it was shown me by living experience, that the human intellectual can be as it were taken away [from a spirit], and his natural light remain to him; yet so much, and such, an intellectual as pertains to the natural is left, that he may still be a man: and I was taught from living experience, that in that state the souls of the dead are then devils, and they perpetrate crimes like a devil. This was also shown by prolonged experience. Indeed it was also shown that angels can be reduced to the same state, from which state there can be an exploration of what sort of man he had been as to the will; for his will, which in the world was restrained by his cupidities, as well as by the civil law, then goes forth as it were, freely. But still God Messiah does not permit a holy one to act freely to this degree, [except] in order that he may see his infernal [tendencies]. 1747, Dec. 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 326 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>326. Quod animae humanae, etiam angeli queant in statum mentis eorum naturalis, ita in eorum concupiscentias transmitti, et sic quoque explorari ad evincendum <sup>1</sup></p><p>quales sunt, dum sibi relicti <sup>2</sup></p><p>.<p>Hodie, et <sup>1</sup></p><p>prius mihi ostensum est per experientiam vivam, quod quasi auferri possit intellectuale humanum, et relinqui ipsi ejus lumen naturale, usque <sup>2</sup></p><p>tantum et tale intellectuale, quantum ad naturale pertineat, ut usque homo sit, et ex viva experientia edoctus, quod tunc animae mortuorum in eo statu sint diaboli, et perpetrent facinora qualia diabolus, quod etiam per prolixam experientiam ostensum est, imo etiam quod angeli in eundem statum queant redigi, ex quo statu explorari potest qualis fuerat homo, in voluntate, nam voluntas ejus tunc libere quasi emittitur, quae in mundo a suis cupiditatibus refraenatur praeter a lege civili; sed Deus Messias usque non permittit sanctum eo usque libere agere, ut videat sua infernalia. 1747, d. 10 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has evinendum<p>2.&nbsp;ad sinistrum capitis manu B.
