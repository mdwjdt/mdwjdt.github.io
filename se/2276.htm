<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2276</h4><p>2276. What is symbolized by the carriage with the two horses, and what by the horse with the rider who was thrown off backwards, that another man mounted, I do not yet know, unless it relates to the matter on which I have just been instructed [2272 ff.]. That is about former times, when there were prophets with whom spirits once dealt and spoke, that it was they who were thrown off backwards from horses. They are also spoken of in the prophecy of Jacob [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Gen. 49:17</a>], and perhaps elsewhere.<p>That another was sitting on the horse, symbolized the conditions at the present time, when spirits operate into a person on earth. (I saw the carriage and horses while awake.) So being thrown from the horse, and the horse's kicking back, does signify the prophetical function, which was thrown off backwards, and which would be succeeded by those who can sit astride the horse and not be thrown. The horses in front of a carriage are likewise symbolic: the horses were thoroughbreds, but the carriage was not as noble, symbolizing faith based on understanding. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2276</h4><p>2276. I do not yet know what is signified by the chariot with the pair of horses, and by the horseman who was thrown off backwards, and by another sitting [on that horse], unless it relates to those things concerning which I am now instructed, that in former times when there were such prophets, or those with [in] whom in former times spirits acted and spoke, that [such] were those who were thrown off backwards by horses, concerning whom [it is also treated] in Jacob's prophecy, and perhaps elsewhere, and by another sitting [on that horse], was signified the state of that time, when spirits act into man: I saw the chariot and horses in wakefulness; wherefore the throwing off [of the rider] by the horse, and his kicking up the heels [recalcitratio], signifies also the mode of acting in prophets [propheticum modum agendi] [that there were some] who were thrown off [rejiceretur for rejicerentur, I think] backwards, and [they] succeeded who could sit upon horses, and not be thrown off. The horses, before the chariot, in like manner, were generous horses; but the chariot, not so noble, signified intellectual faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2276 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2276. Quid currus cum bigis equis, et quid equus cum equite, qui dejectus retrorsum, et quod alius insideret, nondum scio, quid significet, nisi quod ex iis de quibus nunc instructus sum, quod olim, cum prophetae tales essent, seu [tales] cum quibus spiritus agebant et loquebantur olim, quod essent ii, qui rejecti retrorsum ab equis, de quibus etiam in prophetia Jacobi [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2276/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_17" target=_top>Gen. XLIX: 17</a>], et forte alibi, et quod alius insideret, quod significaret hujus temporis status, cum spiritus agunt in hominem-currum <sup>1</sup></p><p>et equos videbam in vigilia-quare <sup>2</sup></p><p>rejectio ab equo et recalcitratio significat quoque propheticum modum agendi, qui rejiceretur retrorsum, et [cui] succederent, qui equis insidere possent, nec rejici. Equi ante currum, similiter; equi erant generosi, sed currus non tam nobilis, significans fidem intellectualem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has hominem, currum<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has vigilia: quare </p>
