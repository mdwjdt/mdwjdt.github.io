<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1483</h4><p>1483. So be it known to those who are living in the world that after death they think in almost the same way as they had in the life of the body - for the same mental imagery remains with them - and that all the spirits round about are aware of what they are thinking, much more clearly than a person understands the conversation of another person [on earth]. So one cannot retreat to any place where all the thoughts of one's heart are not revealed.<p>But the Lord takes care of those who have had faith, lest their inward parts be exposed to evil spirits, who would then immediately rush in. For there are those who long for nothing more eagerly than to punish, whenever they hear or see anything false or evil. 1748, 17 March. </p>
