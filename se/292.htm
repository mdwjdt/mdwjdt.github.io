<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第292节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>292.有一帮魔鬼吹嘘说，他们是弥赛亚，并行神迹。他被允许进入我，好叫他能当着与我同在的来世之人，无论认识的还是不认识的，以及死后不久之人的面更有效地行他的神迹。他和他那帮同伙也一起奋力行神迹，并且他们真以为他们行了神迹，尽管这些所谓的神迹不过是幻觉。因为他们觉得自己似乎被下放到地的深渊，然而他们又能从那里与我交谈；因此，他们仿佛藏了起来，或不在场，这看似一个神迹，就好像他能摧毁或翻转整个宇宙，如那些术士所自以为的。这种情形持续了很长时间，当我问他有何品质时，他回答说，他是弥赛亚；事实上，他以为自己是弥赛亚，并急于非常坚定地肯定这一点，但我不想听。因此，弥赛亚神说的是真的，即：那些将要来的人会自称弥赛亚，行神迹（马太福音24:24）。（1747年12月3日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 292</h4><p>292. There is a diabolic gang who boast that they are the Messiah and perform miracles.<p>He with his gang, who was permitted to enter into me, in order to practice their arts more effectively also attempted to perform miracles in front of those who were with me in the other life, both acquaintances and unknown people not very long deceased, and others, and they really thought they were performing them even though they were only illusions. For they seemed to themselves to be let down into the depths of the earth, from where they were nevertheless able to speak with me, thus as though they were hidden or absent, which seemed miraculous, as if he could turn the universe around or upside-down, as such magicians imagine they can do.<p>This kept on for quite a long time, and when I was inquiring into his character, he replied that he was the Messiah, and indeed he thought he was, and was eager to aver it quite definitely, but I did not want to hear it.<p>Thus [the saying] of God the Messiah comes true, that those would come who would call themselves the Messiah, and would do miracles [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_24.htm">Matt. 24:24</a>]. 1747, the 3rd day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 292</h4><p>292. THAT THERE IS A DIABOLIC CREW THAT BOAST THAT THEY ARE THE MESSIAH, AND THEY DO MIRACLES <p>He who was permitted to enter into me, that he might exercise his arts more efficaciously before those around me in the other life, both known and unknown, and before others not very long since dead - he, together with his crew, also endeavored to perform miracles, and likewise supposed that he did them, although they were mere phantasies. For that diabolic crew seemed to themselves to be let down into the depth of the earth, whence, nevertheless, they could speak with me, thus as if they were hidden or absent, which seemed to be a miracle, as if he could destroy or overturn the universe, as such magicians suppose [they can do]. This lasted for some time, and when I inquired of what quality he was, he replied that he was the Messiah, and indeed supposed himself to be the Messiah. He desired to affirm it very firmly, but I did not want to hear this. Wherefore this coincides with the truth of God Messiah, that there would come those who would call themselves the Messiah, and would perform miracles [Matthew <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_24.htm">xxiv 24</a>. 1747, Dec. 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 292 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>292. Quod diabolica turba sit, quae se jactent esse Messias miracula faciant<p>Ille cum sua turba, cui permissum erat in me intrare, ut eo efficacius suas artes exercerent, coram iis qui circum me in altera vita, notis et ignotis, non ita longe mortuis aliisque,miracula quoque facere tentabat, et se putabat quoque facere, tametsi merae phantasiae essent, nam ii videbantur sibi demitti in profunditatem terrae, unde tamen mecum loqui potuerunt, sic quasi abscondi seu abesse, quod videbatur miraculum, quasi pervertere seu invertere potuisset universum, quod similes magi putant; hoc satis diu perstabat, cumque inquirerem, qualis esset, respondebat, quod esset Messias, et putabat etiam [quod] esset, quod satis firme cupiebat affirmare, sed non volui hoc audire; quare veritas Dei Messiae coincidit, quod venturi sint, qui se Messias vocaturi, et facturi miracula [Matth. XXlV:[24]. 1747, die 3 Dec. </p>
