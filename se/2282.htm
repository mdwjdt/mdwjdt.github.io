<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2282</h4><p>2282. This all shows that outward or superficial people are driven by a prophetic spirit, as was Saul [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_10_10.htm">1 Sam. 10:10-13</a>, 19:23-4] and many others who prophesied, spoken of here and there in the Word. And they were so possessed by spirits that they then did not at all know who they were.<p>But inward people on the other hand, who have faith, cannot be like that, and if they are possessed by such a spirit in a similar way, they still remain themselves, both in regard to their thoughts and their actions. Therefore also it was foretold that prophecies would cease [Mic. 3:5-7, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_2.htm">Zech. 13:2-3</a>], that is, through the Lord, Who would renew the inward person. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2282</h4><p>2282. From these things it may be evident that exteriors or external men are exercised with such a prophetic spirit as was Saul and many others who prophesied, concerning whom [it is treated] here and there in the Word; and that thus they were wholly ignorant who they were (when) thus possessed by spirits. But verily, interior men who are in faith cannot be in such a state [tales], who, if they are possessed by a similar spirit, and only a similar one, are still left to themselves, as much in respect to their thoughts as their acts. Wherefore, also, is it predicted that the prophecies should cease, to wit, through the Lord, who should renew the interior man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2282 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2282. Ex his constare potest, quod exteriores seu externi homines spiritu prophetico agantur, tali quali Saul [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_10_10-13" target=_top>I Sam. X: 10-13</a>, XIX: 23-[24] et plures alii qui prophetabant, de quibus passim in Verbo; et quod sic nesciverint prorsus quinam essent, a spiritibus sic possessi; at vero interiores homines, qui in fide, tales esse nequeunt, qui si spiritu simili et modo simili possidentur, usque sibi relicti sunt, tam quoad cogitationes, quam quoad actus, quare etiam praedictum est, quod prophetiae cessarent [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_micah_3_5-7" target=_top>Mic. III: 5-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_13_2-3" target=_top>Sach. XIII: 2-3</a>], nempe per Dominum, Qui interiorem hominem renovaret. </p>
