<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5827</h4><p>5827. About those who have only faith and not a life of faith, their nature in heaven<p>Those who possessed only faith pursued me. They gathered together and treated me roughly and in this way brought me into a state similar to that in which they were as regards respiration and pulse. And then I was in a state in which my intellectual and voluntary faculty was under water, in a totally dark cloud; and then I realized that there was almost no communication with heaven. It was said to me there that communication of heaven with them was like this, it was like shipwrecked people [covered] with water, or like the life of fish respective to the life of a birds, or comparatively so. In a word, the communication is so faint that when the angels look at them, it is like looking at those who are under water whom they do not see at all but know are there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5827</h4><p>5827. THOSE WHO ARE IN FAITH ALONE AND NOT IN LIFE - OF WHAT QUALITY THEY ARE IN HEAVEN. <p>Those in faith alone persecuted me. They assembled themselves together and inflicted violence; and thus they thrust me into a state like that in which they were, as regards the respiration and the pulse; and then I was in, as it were, a non-intelligent and non-voluntary state, which was entirely overflowed with waters, in a perfectly dark cloud; and then I perceived that I had scarcely any communication with heaven. It was told me that there was such a communication of heaven, with them, as was like that which shipwrecked persons have with the water, or like the life of fishes relatively to the life of birds, or comparatively so: in a word, the communication is so dull, that, when angels look at them it is like looking at those who are under water, whom they do not see at all, but only know that they are there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5827 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5827. De illis qui in sola fide et non vita, quales in coelo<p>Me persequuti sunt illi qui in sola fide, se congregarunt et violentiam inferebant, et sic me mittebant in similem statum in quo illi quoad respirationem et pulsum, et tunc eram in statu sicut intellectuale et voluntariam esset prorsus immersum aquis, in obscuro plane nimboso, et tunc percipiebam quod paene nulla communicatio cum coelo, dictum mihi quod talis communicatio coeli cum illis esset, quae erat sicut naufragi cum aqua, vel sicut vita piscium respective ad vitam avium, aut sic comparative, verbo tam hebes est communicatio ut cum ad illos spectant angeli, est sicut ad illos qui sub aquis quos nequaquam vident, sed sciunt modo quod sint. </p>
