<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1291</h4><p>1291. It is better to have faith without understanding scientifically<p>It is plain that they are more blessed who believe and do not see, than those who do not believe unless they see [cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_29.htm">John 20:29</a>]. Faith without sight is indeed such that it spurns and refuses all proof, just as one who sees an object would do if another went about to prove [the existence] of the object seen.<p>The same principle applies to faith. Trying to prove that an object is seen, when one sees it, calls it into doubt, for demonstrative proof has this effect. 1748, 10 March.<p>Therefore, demonstrative proofs are only for those who will not believe anything unless they see it. Lest these remain in their blindness and become more blind, things must be demonstrated to them that ought not to be demonstrated - for example, that there is a God. This everyone ought to believe without arguments to prove it. Nevertheless, as is usual when something is demonstrated, every argument has something of doubt in it, and invites objections and thus stumbling blocks. 1748, 10 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1291</h4><p>1291. IT IS BETTER TO HAVE FAITH APART FROM WHAT ONE UNDERSTANDS BY MEANS OF THE SCIENCES <p>It is manifest that the blessed are those who believe and do not see rather than those who do not believe unless they see [John <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_29.htm">xi 29</a>. Faith apart from sight is also such that it spurns and rejects all demonstration, in the same way as one who sees an object does not want it demonstrated to him that he sees it. It is the same in regard to faith. When one sees an object, the fact of demonstrating that it is seen, calls it into doubt, for demonstration has this effect. 1748, Mar. 10. Therefore demonstrations are only for those who are unwilling to believe anything unless they see it. Lest such men should remain in their blindness and become still more blinded, things have to be demonstrated which should not have to be demonstrated, as, for example, that there is a God. Everyone ought to believe this without arguments demonstrating it. But, on the contrary, it is usual that when this is being demonstrated there is something of doubt within each argument, and this gives room for objection, thus for scandals. 1748, Mar. 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1291 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1291. Praestat fidem habere absque quod intelligat per scientias<p>Manifestum est, quod [magis] <sup>1</sup></p><p>beati sint qui credunt, et non vident, quam qui non credunt nisi videant [cf. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1291/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_20_29" target=_top>Joh. 20:29</a>]; fides absque visu etiam talis est, ut spernat et rejiciat omnem demonstrationem, sicut qui videt objectum, ut ei demonstretur, quod videat {a}, sic quoque se habet fides; per id quod demonstratum [sit] objectum videri, cum videt, in dubium vocatur, nam id demonstratio secum habet. 1748, 10 Martius. <p>Ideo demonstrationes solum pro iis sunt, qui nihil credere volunt, nisi id videant; ne hi in coecitate sua permaneant, et magis occoecentur, demonstranda sunt, quae non demonstranda; ut exempli causa, quod Deus sit, quod unusquisque debet credere absque demonstrantibus argumentis, at vero, ut solet, dum id demonstratur, tunc cuivis argumento aliquid dubii inest, et dat locum objectioni, sic scandalis. 1748, 10 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
