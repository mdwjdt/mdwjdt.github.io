<p>181.现在我还蒙允许观察几种类型的灵人，如那些对测量及其相关事物着迷的人，他们似乎天生就对几何学感兴趣。其想象被展示给我，它们在这些研究的基础上，以一种神奇的方式将他们与测量学科联系在一起。在我看来，他们并不坏。还有一种灵人，他们自吹自擂，然而也不那么坏。事实上，灵人仅仅是情感，他们以一种微妙的快乐影响人，若是邪恶的女灵人，就被称为塞壬。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 181</h4><p>181. Even now I am permitted to watch certain kinds of spirits, such as those who are fascinated by measurements and related matters, who by nature seem to be allured to studies of the Geometric sciences. Their imaginings, displayed to me, dwelt upon those studies, so as to correlate them all in a remarkable way with the category of measurements. They did not appear to me as evil.<p>There was another kind of spirits who were boastful of themselves, yet who were not so bad, etc. etc., actually being only feelings [<a href="156.htm">156</a>, <a href="178.htm">178</a>], who touch a person with a certain delightful pleasure - and if evil, are to be called Sirens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 181</h4><p>181. It has now also been granted me to observe several kinds of spirits, such as those who are delighted with measurements and the like, whose nature seems to be derived from the study of the geometrical sciences. Their imaginations, which were then exhibited to me, were engaged upon those studies, that they might relate all things in a wonderful manner to measurements, nor were those spirits evil, as they seemed to me. There was another kind of spirits who were boastful; nor were these very evil, etc. etc. Indeed, spirits are only affections, who affect man with a certain exquisite delight; if they are evil female spirits they are to be called sirens. </p>

Aliquot genera spirituum etiam nunc mihi concessum est observare, prout eos, qui delectantur mensuris et similibus, quorum indoles videtur ducta a Geometricarum scientiarum studiis, eorum imaginationes mihi tunc exhibitae versabantur circa ea ut cuncta refererent {a} ad mensurationes mirabili modo, nec erant mali sicut mihi videbantur: aliud genus spirituum erat, qui jactarent se, nec tam mali, etc. etc., quidem <sup>1</sup></p><p>solum affectiones sunt, qui afficiunt hominem jucunditate quadam delitiosa, si malae vocandae sunt Sirenes.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has etc. quidem </p>
