<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4070</h4><p>4070. Afterwards I saw descendants of the noble offspring of the most ancient Church, who appeared separated from the former, their parent, that first appeared in my presence as something altogether empty, though still as spirits. When spirits foster the idea that they are something general, atmospheric, wandering in the universe, then they do actually appear as a kind of vague emptiness, but these spirits as extremely empty, without any sense of being a spirit - for the reason that when that Church declined, they then believed that their spirits or life after death, would be such an emptiness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4070</h4><p>4070. Afterwards there were seen descendants of the noble offspring of the Most Ancient Church, who appeared as if separated from the former, their parent, that was first seen by me, and they seemed as something altogether inane, though still as spirits. When spirits cherish the idea that they are a kind of general, atmospheric something, wandering, about in the universe, they then appear as a general inane something; in this instance most exceedingly so, with scarcely any preception of spirit; for the reason, that when the Church declined, they then believed that their spirits or life after death would be such. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4070 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4070. Postea antiquissimae Ecclesiae proles prolis nobilis apparebat, quae quasi separata videbatur a priori, parente suo, quae primum apparebat apud me, sicut prorsus inane, usque quod spiritus; cum spiritus fovent ideam quod sint commune quid, atmosphaericum, vagans in universo, tunc quidem ut quoddam commune inane apparent, sed hi sicut inanissimum, vix cum aliqua perceptione quod spiritus; ex causa, cum declinaret Ecclesia, quod tunc [crediderint] spiritus eorum seu vitam post mortem fore talem. </p>
