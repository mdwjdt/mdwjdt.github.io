<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>327.对在弥赛亚神里面的人来说，没有什么东西是有害的。通过明显的经历，我已经获知，恶人的诅咒或魔鬼的诅咒，连同他的其它一切诡计，丝毫不能伤害，更不能触及那些在弥赛亚神手里，或在弥赛亚神里面的人。这一点通过以下事实被指示给我：魔鬼念了一个咒语，并将这咒语变成一个代表，打算把它传给某个虔诚的人。但我被赐予能力把这咒语的代表转到我身上。而其他人对它不寒而栗，它因着这样的信心甚至被允许进入我的口和内脏，即：这类事物，因而魔鬼的诅咒丝毫不能伤害，更不能触及那些在弥赛亚神里面的人。今天，我还被魔鬼迷附了，那时，他们正徒劳地施展他们的诡计。最终，我摆脱了对准我心脏的持续不断的联合诅咒。因为以这种方式不断的对准持续了几个小时；但当时我的确感觉不到这些咒语，只是有心悸的感觉，以及由它们所产生的身体内在部位的感觉。他们甚至溜进我的思维，想叫我对生命感到绝望，好像他们能由此产生某种影响；但仍旧没有任何东西能造成伤害，更不能触及我。（1747年12月11日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 327</h4><p>327. To one who is in God the Messiah, nothing can be harmful<p>By plain experience, I have learned that the curse of the wicked, or the devil's curse and all his other devices, cannot in the least harm or touch those who are in the Hand of God the Messiah, that is, in God the Messiah.<p>This was shown me by a curse being read, and turned by devils into a display, with the intent of applying it to some devout person; but the power was granted to me to have the depiction of that curse turn around toward me. While others shuddered at it, it was even permitted to enter into my mouth and inner parts, because of the confidence that nothing of this kind, thus nothing of the devil's curse, can hurt or even touch those who are in God the Messiah.<p>Today also, obsessed by the devil's gang when he was practicing his cunning tricks upon me in vain, I was finally distanced from the incessant, combined curses that were being aimed at my heart. For several hours they kept coming, so aimed; but at the time I was really unable to feel the curses except by perceptible heart-palpitations, as well as by a certain feeling in the inward parts of my body arising from them. They even slipped into my thoughts their wish that I despair of life - as if they can achieve anything by that - but still nothing whatever can harm or even touch [me]. 1747, the 11th day of December. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The manuscript has "die 11 Dec." for this passages probably written on the 10th. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 327</h4><p>327. NOTHING CAN BE HARMFUL TO HIM WHO IS IN GOD MESSIAH <p>I have learnt by manifest experience that the curse of the impious and of the devil, with his other artifices, cannot in the least injure or affect those who are in the hand of God Messiah, that is, who are in God Messiah. This was shown to me by the fact, that a curse was read and turned by the devils into a representation, with the intention of transferring it to someone pious. But the power was granted me of bringing the representation of that curse upon myself; although the others abhorred it, it was also permitted to enter even into my mouth and viscera, in the confidence that no such thing, thus that nothing of the devil's curse, can injure, still less affect those who are in God Messiah. Today I was also obsessed by the devil's crew, when they exercised their artifices in vain. At length, I was removed from the continued curses, combined and directed towards my heart, continued and directed in this manner for some hours, and then indeed I could not feel those curses, except by the sensible palpitations of my heart, and also by a certain affection of the interiors of the body thence arising, and likewise by an insinuation into my thoughts, that they wanted me to despair of my life, as though they could thence effect something; but still nothing can ever injure, still less affect. 1747, Dec. 11. </p>
