<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3112</h4><p>3112. Afterwards, when this separating ceased, they acted as one person as before, and I asked them if they knew whether they rule themselves, because they had just been punished. They said they know they are not ruled by themselves, without there being discordance. Then I inquired by what lord they were ruled, whether by the dragon, which they denied, but by what other lord, they did not know. They still do not want to say by the Lord. For without agreement toward one purpose, and without the Lord, by whom they are held in agreement-such as thinking that they also control me and are as a person on earth, thus everyone, no matter how many, are thus held in agreement - [without Him] their purpose is that of their character, a purpose that does not hold them in agreement, but carries the spirit of one against the other. 1748, 9 <sup>1</sup>Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The autograph has 8. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3112</h4><p>3112. Afterwards, this separation ceased, and they acted like a single [una] person as before. I spoke with them [asking] if they knew whether they rule themselves, for their mind [had just been subject] [is ruled] to [by] punishment: they said that they know that they are not ruled by themselves, because then there is discord. Then I inquired by what Lord [were they ruled]: whether by the dragon: this they denied; or whether by somebody else. They did not know. They were not yet willing to say that [they were ruled] by the Lord: for they think that without concurrence [agreement] to one end, and without the Lord, by whom they are kept in agreement: they may [even themselves] thereby manage me, [and] that they are as it were, the man. Thus [thinks] everyone: no matter how many there are. They are kept in such agreement. [This] is the end [that accords with] their nature. Such end does not keep them in agreement, but carries [brings] their souls one against another. - 1748, September 8. </p>
