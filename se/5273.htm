<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5273</h4><p>5273. The visitation then entered that great underground town. There was a great opening on the front and from there a road on each side and also in front. But first there was a rise there and after this a descent, so that the entrance could not be seen on the side where the city was earlier.<p>5273[1/2]. It is important to know that that this pope's dominion covered that whole wide, large tract spoken of above [<a href="5269.htm">5269</a>]. It extended widely around where there were villages and clusters of houses as well. So his power extended very far. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5273</h4><p>5273. The visitation next entered that great under-city. <sup>1</sup>There was a great opening in front, and a road from thence on both sides, and also forwards. But first, there was an elevation there, and afterwards a descent, for the purpose that that entrance should not be exposed on that side where the former city was. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See n. <a href="../se/5270.htm">5270</a>. <p>2.&nbsp;i.e. the little city on the top of the mountain. - See n. <a href="../se/5270.htm">5270</a>, beginning. <p>5273a. It should first be known, that the dominion of that Pope was over all that wide and ample tract concerning which see above [no. 5269] - which extended widely round about, and where villas and houses were closely packed; so that his power was very widespread. </p>

Dein intrabat visitatio in suburbium illud magnum, erat apertura magna antrorsus, et inde via utrinque a latere, et quoque antrorsum, sed ibi elevatum prius, et postea descensus, ex causa ut introitus ille non pateret ab illa parte, ubi urbs prior.<p>5273 [1/[2] . Sciendum primum quod dominium illius papae esset super totum illum tractum de quo supra latum et amplum, qui se extendebat tam late circum ubi villae, et domus confertim: sic ut ejus potestas maxime extensa esset. </p>
