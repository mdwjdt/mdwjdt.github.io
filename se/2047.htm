One can also recognize it if one spirit who is deceitful is compelling another to speak, and that the deception belongs to a different spirit than the one who is speaking. For the phenomenon of speaking through others, who might be called their speaking mediums, is a most familiar one among spirits.<p>These and the previous points regarding speech I was enabled to learn today by actual experience. I have been given to know these same things earlier, but I am not sure that I reflected on them to the same extent. 1748, 22 May. </p>
