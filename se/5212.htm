Afterwards, the conspiracy, which involved a great multitude of such as were upon the hills for a very considerable extent around, was exposed. Whilst I saw this there, I fell asleep; and then that conspiracy was directed at me, they besieging me around on every side, and also in a long row extending to the farthest boundary, wishing, in this way, to destroy me utterly. But I then awoke, and was brought away from there; and, after that, their overthrow commenced. Nearly all were overthrown, and cast into that fourth gloomy gulf of which I spoke above. <sup>1</sup>Many thousands were thus overthrown and cast in; and this, until the riot was quieted. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See n. <a href="../se/5106.htm">5106</a>. </p>
