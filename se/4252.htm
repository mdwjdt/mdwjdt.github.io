<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4252</h4><p>4252. About Providence and miracles<p>I realized, and spoke with those in the other life about the fact, that people an never become better, and receive faith, and become confirmed in faith, if they obtain everything they desire, and know all about it, but all things must go against their desires, and against their thoughts, so to speak - and still they must believe that the Lord rules all things down to the very least. Unless we are so held and so believe, when things contrary to our expectation and desire take place, we can never receive faith, nor become confirmed in it. Otherwise, if even the very least thing should happen thereafter that does not agree with our desire and expectation, we begin to doubt, and to deny. This I realized, and I spoke about those matters with those in the other life. 1749, 4 May. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Jupiter, meaning Thursday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4252</h4><p>4252. CONCERNING PROVIDENCE AND MIRACLES.<p>It was perceived, and conversation had on the subject with those in the other life, that man can never be made better and receive faith, or be confirmed in faith, if he obtains what he desires, and knows how everything is; but that all things ought to be contrary to his cupidities, and contrary to his thoughts, and yet he is to believe that the Lord rules in all and single things. Unless man is so held and so believes, when things occur contrary to his opinion and his cupidity, he can never receive faith and be confirmed in it; acting on any other principle, if the slightest thing occurs not in agreement with his cupidity or opinion, he begins to doubt and deny. This was perceived and made the theme of conversation with those in the other life. - 1749, May 4. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4252 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4252. De Providentia et miraculis<p>Perceptum est, et cum illis in altera vita loquutus, de illo, quod nusquam homo melior fieri possit, et accipere fidem, et confirmari in fide, si obtineat quae cupit, et si sciat quomodo se habet, sed omnia esse debent contra ejus cupiditates, et quasi contra ejus cogitationes, et usque credet, quod Dominus regat omnia et singula, nisi homo ita teneatur, et nisi sic credat, cum contraria ejus opinioni et cupiditati fiunt, nusquam accipere potest fidem, et confirmari in illa; si aliter, si vel minimum accideret postea, quod non convenit ejus cupiditati et opinioni, incipit dubitare et negare: hoc perceptum, et de illis loquutus cum illis in altera vita. 1749, 4 Maj. </p>
