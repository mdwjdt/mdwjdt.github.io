<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2552</h4><p>2552. Seeking eagerly for the cause, I recalled to mind the dream about the birds, and I was given to learn that there was something in heaven - a certain conversation among those there about thoughts, which birds symbolize in the world of spirits - about which they had been talking. For such things cannot happen in the world of spirits except by the inflow of heaven, where birds are not at all being thought about, but meditations and thoughts. I was instructed by those who were in the inward world of spirits, who are communicators, that there had been a discussion in heaven in a certain society about the inflow of an earthly being's thoughts that penetrate even to heaven-whether from human thinking they flow into heaven. It would be contrary to order, however, </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2552</h4><p>2552. When I inquired the cause, then was recalled into my memory the sleep [dream] concerning the birds, and it was given to know that it has been something in the heavens; that they have held some speech concerning thoughts, which are signified by birds in the world of spirits, concerning which there has been discourse, for such things cannot happen in the world of spirits save through influx from heaven, wherein there is no thinking of birds but of meditations and thoughts; and I was instructed by those who were in the interior world of spirits, who are communicators, that there has been discourse in heaven, in a certain society, concerning the influx of the man's thoughts which penetrate even into heaven, whether they inflow from man's thought into heaven, when yet this would be contrary to order. </p>
