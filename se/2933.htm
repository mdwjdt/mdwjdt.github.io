<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2933</h4><p>2933. They were then in a state of mind that they did not know they were not living in the body. But when they were shown that they now lived in the other life so that they were convinced they were living as spirits, then they said, if this is so, they had been unspeakably deceived, for due to that fantasy they can never believe they would ever live after death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2933</h4><p>2933. They were then in a state, that they did not know other than that they were living in the body: but when it was shown them that they were now living in another life, so that they might be persuaded that they live as spirits, they then said, if this be so that they are deceived to such a degree, as can never be told: for from such phantasy they can never believe that they should ever live after the death of the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2933 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2933. Erant tunc in statu, quod nescirent aliter ac quod in corpore viverent, at cum iis ostenderetur quod nunc viverent in altera vita, sic ut persuaderentur se vivere ut spiritus, tunc dicebant, si hoc ita est, quod ita decepti sint, ut nusquam dici possit, nam ex tali phantasia nusquam credere possunt, quod usquam victuri post mortem corporis. </p>
