<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3870</h4><p>3870. Another was likewise making something similar by means of fantasies, but [I realized] that it symbolized a man, but he appeared at once as something inanimate, like a dirty wooden thing. He also was compelled to receive a fantasy, in which he was wrapped about into something like a bundle, from which he could not disentangle himself without undergoing a painful punishment. 1748, 5 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3870</h4><p>3870. Another also attempted something similar by phantasies, but something which should represent a man. The object immediately appeared inanimate, and at the same time as a foul woody something. He also was forced to take to himself the phantasy, with which, it being transformed into a bandage, he was enwrapped, and from which he could extricate himself only on penalty of extreme suffering. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3870 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3870. Alius quoque simile quid per phantasias faciens, sed aliquid quod virum significaret, sed apparebat illico ut inanimatum, et spurcum ligneum, is quoque adactus est phantasiam recipere, qua circumvolvebatur, ex qua sicut fascia, non nisi cum poena cruciatus potuit se extricare. 1748, 5 Nov. </p>
