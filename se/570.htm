<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第570节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>570.除了前面（519-20节）所提到的木星灵外，还有其他灵人朝相反的事进行劝说、催促，因为每个地方都有对立的灵人，这些就是那些被逐出他们的社群并变得邪恶的灵人（520节）。当他们靠近某个人时，有一种类似于飞火的东西落近这个人面前，由此行进到背部下面，他从那里朝更高的部位说话，嗓音沙哑或低沉，无法清楚描述出来；他几乎像是用分叉的舌头说话。他告诉他们相反的事，就是叫他们不要按照天使的教导生活，而是不受约束，随从自己的意思，以及与教导灵之前告诉他们的事相反的那类事。因为通常教导灵离开后不久，他们就到来，然后对他说一些相反的话，并劝诱他过放荡的生活。但那里的人们知道这些灵人具有这种秉性，所以根本不理会他们。他们以这种方式也获知何为邪恶，因为只要他们是世人，事实上是具有这种品质的世人，那么没有对邪恶的认识，他们的生命和理解力就不能发展；但他们必须通过邪恶被教导何为良善，由此学会避开这种邪恶，追求良善，从而也被良善打动。（1748年1月27日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 570</h4><p>570. Besides the spirits of that earth spoken of [<a href="519.htm">519-520</a>], there are other spirits who urge toward things contrary, for everywhere there are also opposite spirits these are their spirits who have been banished from their society have become evil. When they come up anyone, something like a flying fire falls near the front parts of the person, passing thence his back parts lower down from there he speaks toward the higher parts in fact in a rough forked voice, such as cannot be adequately described, almost as if he spoke with a forked tongue. He tells them contrary things, namely, that they should not live according the teaching of the angels, but free from restraints things of this kind that are contrary what the teaching spirit had told them previously. For the most part they come not long after the teaching spirit has left then tell the person the opposite, urging him toward a licentious life. But because the people there know that these spirits are of that character, they do not heed them. They also learn in this way what evil is, for without a recognition of evil - inasmuch as there are such people - their life understanding cannot develop; but they must be taught what is good by means of evil thus they learn avoid evil to strive after good, as well as be moved by what is good. 1748, the 27th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 570</h4><p>570. Besides the spirits of that earth spoken of before, there are other spirits who also persuade things contrary, for there are contrary spirits everywhere, and these are the spirits of those who have been banished from their society, and have become evil [see n. <a href="../se/520.htm">520</a>. When these come alongside a man, something resembling flying fire falls near the front of the man and so proceeds to his back low down, and there speaks towards his higher parts, and this in a hoarse or cloven voice which cannot very well be described; it is almost as if he spoke with a forked tongue. He says contrary things to them, namely, that they ought not to live according to the instruction of their angels, but according to their own license, and similar things which are opposed to what the instructing spirit had previously told them. For the most part they come not long after the instructing spirit has gone away, and so say things contrary to him and persuade to a licentious life. But because the men there know they are such, they care nothing about them. Thus they learn also what evil is, for their life and understanding without a knowledge of evil, as long as they are men and indeed men of such a quality, cannot be given; but they must be instructed what good is by means of evil, and so learn to shun evil and to strive after good, thus also to be affected with good. 1748, Jan. 27. </p>
