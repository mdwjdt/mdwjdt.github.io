<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 958</h4><p>958. About the hardness or softness of calluses<p>The calluses that are taken out, and by which they examine the souls' outer or bodily qualities brought with them after bodily life [862 ff., 951], are harder or softer, depending upon the state of the actual life they have led.<p>Those that are hard must be softened, which is done by various punishments. Before they soften, the better outer qualities cannot be joined with inner ones, nor can evil qualities, together with their associations, be as it were blotted out. These must be torn out, so to speak, by a spiritual method.<p>Those having harder calluses suffer great, in fact tremendous, pains, and deeper torments, because the roots are affected; while those having softer ones, do not suffer such pains, as I was taught by experience when this same requirement, or [action of] being pulled apart, was performed on me, as on anyone else [<a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="932.htm">932</a>]. 1748, 23 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 958</h4><p>958. CONCERNING THE HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS OF CALLUSES <p>The calluses which the soul takes with him after his bodily life, and which are removed and examined as to what he is like in external or corporeal things, are harder or softer according to his state of life in act. Those which are hard are softened, this being done by various punishments. Before they are softened, better things cannot be conjoined with the internals, nor can evil things be as it were obliterated, together with their connections which are to be torn out, as it were, in a spiritual manner. Those who have harder calluses sustain great and intense pain, and the torments are the more deep-seated because the roots of the evil are touched. But those whose calluses are softer do not sustain such pain, as I have learned by experience when a similar oppression and tearing was wrought in me as in another. 1748, Feb. 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 958 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>958. Calli, qui eximuntur, et [quibus] inspiciunt, qualis anima est in externis, seu corporeis, quae post vitam corporis secum fert, sunt duriores, et molliores, secundum statum vitae actu; qui duri sunt, emollescent, et hoc variis punitionibus; antequam emollescunt, non cum internis possunt conjungi ea quae meliora sunt, et quasi obliterari ea quae mala, cum connexionibus, quae sic spirituali modo quasi discerpendae. Qui duriores callos habent, ii sustinent magnos imo ingentes dolores, et penitiores cruciatus, quia radices tanguntur, at qui molliores, ii non sustinent tales dolores, sicut ab experientia instructus, cum similis incumbentia seu distractio in me facta sicut in alio. 1748, 23 Febr. </p>
