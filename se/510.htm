<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 510</h4><p>510. Continuation about Mohammed<p>When he was finally convinced that those things had taken place while I was asleep, and that I had been completely unaware of it, he was then tempted in a different manner, being put under a veil by the dragon, and thus treated like the others - and in fact, under a thicker veil than the others - and also bound, as I am now told. But still he remained steadfast. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 510</h4><p>510. CONTINUATION CONCERNING MAHOMED <p>When at length he was persuaded that these things [see n. <a href="../se/509.htm">509</a> were done during sleep, and that I knew nothing whatever about it, he was then tempted in another way, namely, he was sent by the dragon under the veil, and he was thus acted upon like others - and indeed under a denser veil than others. He was also bound, as I am now told, but he still persevered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 510 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>510. Continuatio de Mahumede<p>Cum tandem persuasus esset, quod illa facta sint in somno, et quod prorsus nesciverim id, tunc alio modo tentatus, nempe a dracone missus sub velum, et sic actus, ut alii, et quidem sub densius velum quam alii, ligatus quoque, ut nunc mihi dicitur, sed usque perseveravit. </p>
