<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2323</h4><p>2323. This was a very plain indication that the Lord rules the universe; I have not yet seen a plainer one, as some spirits near me also confess.<p>It is, however, a condition of the spiritual world that if a single spirit thinks out of turn, at once his neighbors, and those beyond them, are upset, for there are so many objects of their thoughts, and so many stirrings of their efforts, powers and desires, which were then being held in suspense and restrained, so that nothing could be raised by a single spirit that would disturb anyone's chain of thoughts. 1748, 13 June.<p>2323[a]. In the world of spirits, especially of [newly arrived] souls, they are sometimes given freedom and their bonds so to speak let loose, so that their passions are given free rein, but seldom their falsities. Then they imagine that their aura would spread far out and even throughout the universal heaven, and disturb not only the whole world of spirits, but even the heavens. But this is a fallacy of the senses. Their energy field does not extend far, but ceases at a small periphery, so to speak; for the equilibrium, I would call it, is such that it at once stops, even if it appears to cause a great disturbance. This is quite evident from the human race, in that a great disturbance among some does not spread out widely, and yet all are ruled through spirits in the world of spirits. 1748, 13 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2323</h4><p>2323. In the world of spirits, especially [the region] of souls, sometimes license is granted them, and the bonds, as it were, are loosened, so that the rein is relaxed upon their cupidities, but rarely on their falsities. Then they suppose that [their sphere] [ea] extended afar, and indeed throughout the universal heaven, and disturbed not only the whole world of spirits, but also the heavens. But it is a fallacy of sense; the sphere of their activity does not extend to a distance; it immediately ceases it a narrow circumference, as it were, for such is the equilibrium, as I may style it, that it is established immediately should there appear even a very great disturbance. This must be plain enough from the human race, that the greatest disturbance amongst any does not extend widely, and yet all are ruled through the world of spirits. - 1748, June 13. </p>
