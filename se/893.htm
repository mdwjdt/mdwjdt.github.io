<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 893</h4><p>893. About those who relate to the pancreatic duct, the hepatic duct, and the gall bladder <sup>1</sup><p>There are spirits relating to these three members, who, while distinct among themselves, are nevertheless brought together in relation to the state of those spirits whom they work upon. Especially, they stand by at chastisements and punishments, which they want to direct, so to speak; and the worst of them are so stubborn that they never let up, unless compelled by punishments, or things that frighten them, whereupon they promise they will no longer do all those things. But immediately thereafter, they return to the same nature.<p>They are those who had clung to their own opinions and illusions very tenaciously, yet who do not act out of hatred, but out of a natural perverseness. (Such appear as little old women of the kind who grow old in their passions, stubbornly holding on to them.) In their normal state, they think about and dwell on nothing else - and I do not know whether they take pleasure in anything else - than being allowed to engage in such activities, and to chastise, whip, bite, and the like cruel behavior, just as do those biles, especially the gall. All they want is to be engaged in their foul [practices]. 1748, 20 February.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original, the number 891 is repeated here and 892 does not occur. It is left unchanged here because it is referred to in the index. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 893</h4><p>893. CONCERNING THOSE WHO RELATE TO THE PANCREATIC DUCT, THE HEPATIC DUCT, AND THE GALL BLADDER <p>There are spirits who relate to these three members which are distinct one from the other, but set together according to the state of the spirits upon whom they operate. They are present especially at castigations and punishments which they wish as it were to direct. The worst of them are so stubborn that they never desist unless impelled by punishments or such things as terrify them, for they are afraid of punishments. They then promise all things, and that they will do so no more, but immediately afterwards they return to the same nature. They are those who have clung most tenaciously to their own opinions and phantasies, but who nevertheless do not act from hatred, but from natural depravity. Such spirits appear as little old women such as are wont to grow old in cupidities so as to become tenacious in them. When they are in their natural state they then think nothing, but they inhere in these things. I do not know whether they are delighted with anything else than being allowed to be in such activities, and to chastise, scourge, bite, and to act in a like foul manner, as do those biles, especially that of the gall bladder. They only desire to be in foul things. 1748, Feb. 20. </p>

De iis qui referunt ductum pancreaticum, ductum hepaticum et cystin felleam<p> <sup>1</sup></p><p>Sunt spiritus, qui referunt tria haec membra, quae distincta sunt inter se, sed componuntur secundum statum eorum spirituum, in quos operantur, imprimis adsistunt castigationibus, et punitionibus, quas volunt quasi dirigere, et qui pessimi eorum sunt, ita contumaces sunt, ut nusquam desistant, nisi per supplicia, aut talia, quae eos terrificant, nam timent supplicia, et tunc promittunt omnia, quod amplius non facturi sint, sed statim post in similem naturam redeunt, sunt ii qui tenacissime <sup>2</sup></p><p>inhaeserunt suis opinionibus, et phantasiis, sed tamen non ex odio agunt, sed a naturali pravitate: tales apparent sicut vetulae, quae solent insenescere in cupiditatibus, ut in iis tenaces sint; dum in statu suo naturali sunt, tunc nihil cogitant, sed iis inhaerent, nec scio an delectentur alio, quam ut liceat iis in talibus activi <sup>3</sup></p><p>esse, et castigare, flagellare, mordere, ac similiter foede agere; sicut etiam biles istae, cumprimis cystica, modo in foedis cupiunt esse. 1748, 20 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;892 deest<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has tenacissimi<p>3.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
