<p>594.关于欧洲灵的不信。当我正在读关于我们救主受难的内容时，一些被称为基督徒的欧洲灵介绍了这样那样的事，想要迷惑木星灵，企图引他们远离真正的信仰，好把他们自己那可耻的想法传给木星灵；这些想法有很多，都与我们救主的受难和钉死在十字架上有关。然而，我对木星居民说，在这些讲述这些无礼想法的人当中，可能有一些人活在肉身时就是公开的传道者；当他们传讲这些事时，会深深地激发，把普通民众感动得落泪；然而，他们现在却成了这样的嘲笑者，因为他们现在出于自己的性情和内心来讲话和推理。木星居民对此感到惊讶，对他们的内层竟有如此大的不一致，以至于他们能嘴上说一套，心里想另一套而感到目瞪口呆。他们说，这对他们来说是不可能的，因为他们的脸说不出与他们的心不同的话来。（1748年1月28日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 594</h4><p>594. About the disbelief of European spirits<p>When I was reading something about the suffering of our Savior, certain European spirits who had been called Christians, brought in this and that, wanting to lead astray spirits of the earth Jupiter, with the intent of drawing them away from the true faith so that they could communicate to them their own scandalous thoughts, which are many and relate to the passion and crucifixion of our Savior.<p>However, I said to the inhabitants of Jupiter that among those telling these offensive things, there might be some who in the life of the body were able to be public preachers, and when they were preaching about the Lord's passion had been deeply stirred, and had moved the common people to tears; and yet now they are such scorners, because now they are speaking and reasoning from their character and their heart.<p>Then the inhabitants of the other earth were amazed at this, and dumbfounded that there could have been such a disharmony of their inward parts that they had been able to speak in this manner, and yet have something else at heart - which for them, as they say, is impossible, for their face cannot speak something different than their heart. 1748, the 28th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 594</h4><p>594. THE INFIDELITY OF EUROPEAN SPIRITS <p>When I was reading something about the passion of our Savior, certain European spirits, who are called Christians, introduced such and such things, desiring to seduce the spirits of the planet Jupiter, with the intention of leading them away from the true faith in order that they might communicate to them their scandals, which are many, and they were implored by the passion and crucifixion of our Savior. I said, however, to the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter that among those who do such things, there might be those who had been public preachers during the life of the body, and who, when they were preaching these things, were deeply stirred themselves and moved the people to tears; and yet they were such scoffers now, because they speak and reason from their disposition or heart. The inhabitants of that other earth wondered at this, and were astonished that there could be such a disagreement of their interiors, that they could speak in this way and yet have at heart something different. This, they say, is impossible with them, for their face cannot speak otherwise than their heart. 1748, Jan. 28. </p>
