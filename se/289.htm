<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>289.关于就许多天使一致说话而言，天使中间的和谐一致。蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，今早我通过大量经历被指示，天使若不是能一起说话和行动的那类，就无法一起生活在福分中。福分就在于和谐一致，以致许多人，甚至众多人以为他们自己是一体。因为一体就来自许多人的一致同意，或许多人的和谐一致；这一体则产生福分和幸福；幸福则通过诸幸福的和谐一致而两三倍地增加。<p>1/2.至于他们的言语，今天我通过大量经历被指示，许多人同时一起说话、思考和理解，如在天堂通常的情形。我还被指示，当他们中间有人凭自己思考，或出于某种爱，或由某种爱所形成的一种习惯而想要说更多，或如果不相似的其他人加入他们的团体时，尤其当他们尚未通过消磨做好准备就开始时，许多人中间的不和谐立刻就能明显被感觉到。以这种方式能准确无误地找出不一致的灵人。于是，这个灵人以某种方式照着他不一致的性质而被分离出去，直到他做好准备，习惯团结，并在创造天堂的和谐一致上发挥自己的积极作用。因此，这种和谐一致出于对社群的爱，这爱反过来又出于对弥赛亚神的爱；构成天堂之物的，正是这和谐一致。（1747年12月3日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 289</h4><p>289. About the harmony among angels, even so far as a speaking of many in unison<p>By prolonged experience this morning, through the mercy of God the Messiah I was shown that angels cannot live together in blessedness unless they are the kind that can speak and act together. Blessedness consists in unanimity and harmony, whereby many, even very many, consider themselves to be a one. For from many agreeing together, or a harmony of many, comes a oneness, which results in blessedness and happiness and, from a shared feeling of happiness, a doubled and tripled happiness.<p>289. 1/2. As for their speech, today by a lengthy experience I was shown many at the same time speaking, thinking and understanding together, as is usual in the heavens.<p>I was also shown that when there is anyone among them who thinks by himself, or who wants to say anything more [than the rest] due to some kind of love, or to a habit formed because of a given love; or if others who are not similar are brought into their company - especially when they are not yet prepared by a purging process, and initiated - then that discordancy among the many is at once quite clearly felt, so that it can never fail to be found out who of the spirits is at variance. So that spirit is dissociated in some way, depending upon the nature of his dissent, until such a time as he is prepared, and becomes accustomed to joining in, and to taking an active part himself in creating heavenly harmony.<p>Therefore it is unanimity coming from the love of society, this in turn coming from the love of God the Messiah, which makes what is heavenly. 1747, the 3rd day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 289</h4><p>289. CONCERNING THE HARMONY OF THE ANGELS EVEN AS TO THE SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH OF MANY <p>By the mercy of God Messiah it was shown me this morning by much experience, that the angels are unable to live together in blessedness, unless they are such that they speak and act together. Blessedness consists in unanimity and harmony, so that many, even very many, suppose themselves to be one. For from many agreeing together, or from the harmony of many, there exists a one from which there is blessedness and felicity; and from the concord of felicities, the felicity is doubled and trebled. <p>289 1/2. This was shown me today by much experience with regard to speech, for as is the case in the heavens, many speak, think and perceive together. It was also shown that when there is anyone among them who thinks in himself, or who from some love, or from a habit formed from some love, wants to say more, or if others are associated who are not similar, especially if they have not as yet been prepared and initiated by vastation, then that dissent among the many is at once perceived quite manifestly. In this way there can be no mistake in perceiving which of the spirits dissents. He is therefore dissociated in some way according to his dissent, until he is prepared and accustomed to be in unity, and as a part, also form the heavenly harmony; so that the unanimity that comes from a love of society and this from a love of God Messiah, may form what is heavenly. 1747, Dec. 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 289 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>289. De harmonia angelorum, etiam quoad loquelam plurium simultaneam<p>Pluri experientia hoc mane, ex misericordia Dei Messiae, ostensum est, quod angeli nequeant simul in beatitudine vivere, nisi tales sint, ut simul loquantur, et agant; in unanimitate et harmonia consistit beatitudo, ita ut plures ac permulti autument se unum esse, nam ex pluribus consentientibus seu harmonia plurium existit unum, ex quo beatitudo, et felicitas, et ex consensu felicitatum, duplicata et triplicata felicitas.<p>289a. Quod ad loquelam hoc hodie pluri experientia ostensum est, plures enim simul, ut fit in coelis, simul loquuntur, cogitant et percipiunt, ostensum etiam quod dum aliquis inter eos sit, qui in se cogitat, qui aliquid plus velit dicere ex quocunque amore, vel ex habitu ex amore quodam formato, aut si alii qui non similes sunt, associantur, imprimis quando adhuc per vastationem non sunt praeparati, ac initiati, tunc dissensus iste inter plures illico satis manifeste percipitur, sic ut nusquam falli possit, quin percipiatur quinam ex spiritibus dissentit, quare is dissociatur aliquo modo, secundum dissensum ejus, usque dum praeparatus, et adsuescit una esse, et harmoniam coelestem ut pars quoque formare; sic ut unanimitas, quae venit ex amore societatis, et [amor] hujus ex amore Dei Messiae, formet coeleste. 1747, d. 3 Dec. </p>
