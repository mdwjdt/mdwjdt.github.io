<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1455</h4><p>1455. <sup>1</sup>Spirits of the planet Mercury go in companies and regiments. Many of them are now gathered together, seemingly forming a company, and so they are united by the Lord so as to work together as one and be of one sensation or mind. Otherwise, like inner sensation, they would be easily dispelled, so they must be held together as one by the Lord. When they are speaking, or a spirit is speaking what they are thinking, then they are moved all together, like a huge mass, and in fact, in such a great wave that my right foot and the earth I was standing on seemed to undulate. This symbolizes that a person cannot live intelligently without inner sensation. For the foot, because it walks, symbolizes life in the body.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;J. F. I. Tafel substituted 1455 1/2. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1455</h4><p>1455. They cannot be called the internal memory because, as I have now been instructed, in them there is the faculty of thinking, that is, internal sensation gives this faculty. I could scarcely speak with them except by a kind of active thought; they can understand this much better than the speech of words which they hate and are unwilling to hear. They suppose that they are the thought rather than internal sensation, as they say. They have not, however, the faculty of judgment, but only a delight in cognitions; nevertheless they can also be called simply thought, for without it there is no interior sensation. But thought and judgment differ greatly. <p>mThey are not the thought from judgment because they do not draw conclusions concerning use and end, from the end.n <p>1455 1/2. <sup>1</sup>Spirits of the planet Mercury go in cohorts and troops. Many are now assembled and together form as it were a globe, and in this way they are united by the Lord so that they may act as a one, and be of one sentiment and mind. Otherwise, like internal sensation, they would be easily dissipated, for they must be held together as a one by the Lord. When they speak, or when a spirit speaks what they think, then together they are moved like a great roll, and indeed by such a great undulation that my right foot, as it were, undulated, and also the earth upon which it stood. This signifies that man can by no means live as to the understanding without internal sensation, for since the foot walks it signifies to live in the body. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the printed text 1455 1/2 is placed before 1455. Because of the search program we had to reverse these passages so both could be found under 1455. NewSearch98 footnote. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1455 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1455. <sup>1</sup></p><p>Spiritus telluris Mercurii vadunt per cohortes et phalanges, congregantur nunc plures, et formant quasi globum simul, et sic a Domino uniuntur, ut unum quasi agant, sintque uno sensu seu animo, aliter sicut sensus internus facile dissiparentur, nam teneri in unum a Domino debent; quando loquuntur, seu spiritus loquitur id quod cogitant, tunc simul quasi volumen magnum moventur, et quidem tali unda magna, ut pes meus dexter quasi undularet, et terra cui insisteret, quod significat, quod homo vivere intellectu nequeat absque sensu interno, nam pes quia ambulat, significat corpore vivere.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition 1455 substituit </p>
