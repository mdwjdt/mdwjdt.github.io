<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3643</h4><p>3643. It was illustrated in what manner many thinking diversely from each other are made to think alike, as was also told to spirits, namely that one speaking in large gatherings, and in churches, holds very many in the thought of what he is saying so that despite their diversities, everyone thinks alike and can discuss the same topics with others. This example is only to illustrate, for it helps the spirits better to understand. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3643</h4><p>3643. In what manner many [spirits] thinking diversely from each other are made to think alike, was illustrated - as it was also said to spirits - from the case of one speaking, for instance, in great meetings and in churches, who would hold many in the thought of the things which he utters, and then everyone thinks similarly, and can discourse with others concerning the same topics. This [was said] solely for the sake of illustration, for thus the spirits perceived it better. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3643 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3643. Quomodo plures [similiter] cogitent diversimode ex multis, illustratum, sicut etiam dictum spiritibus, quod unus loquens, ut in coetibus magnis, et in ecclesiis, teneat permultos in cogitatione eorum quae dicit, et tamen unusquisque similiter cogitat, et de iisdem quoque loqui potest cum aliis, hoc solum illustrationis causa, nam spiritus ita melius percipiebant. </p>
