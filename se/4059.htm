<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4059</h4><p>4059. That feelings have with them all knowledge, is clear enough from animals, both from those that are passions, which are evils, and from those that are [good] feelings, especially birds, which know all and the very least things relating to their affection, about which very much could be told - such as how they bring forth and raise offspring, how they acquire food for themselves, how they provide for the coming winter, how they build their little homes, how they should live with their companions and are acquainted with the [appropriate] forms of government, and all those things better than human beings with all their sciences.</p><p>[2] Nor would mankind have had any need to cultivate or learn the sciences artificially, nor to write so many books on the education of infants and children, as well as numberless other subjects, if he had had the love of true faith. But since he has only passions, and knows certain matters of faith separated from love, therefore he knows nothing, except by means if sciences handed down by word of mouth or by books, because such subjects now have to be learned that follow [naturally] from love. 1748, 24 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4059</h4><p>4059. That affections have with them all [appropriate] science, may abundantly appear from animals - as much those that are evil cupidities, as those which are [good] affections, and especially from birds, which know all and singular the things pertaining to their affections, of which much might be said; as, for instance, that they know how to bring forth and nourish their young, how to obtain food for themselves, how to foresee and provide for themselves against a coming winter, how to construct their nests, how to live with their mates, and what forms of government to adopt, -all which they know better than man with all his sciences. Man would have no need to establish such artificial systems of science, and to learn them, nor to write so many books respecting the training of infants and children, if he had been in the love of true faith. But since he is only in cupidities, and has merely persuaded himself of certain things of faith separate from love, he therefore knows nothing except through sciences orally taught or delivered through the medium of books, because such things as follow love are [now] to be learned. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4059 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4059. Quod affectiones secum habeant omnem scientiam, constare satis potest ab animalibus, tam [ab iis] quae cupiditates sunt, quae mala, quam ab iis quae affectiones sunt, imprimis aves, quae sciunt omnia et singula, quae affectionis eorum sunt, de quibus perplura possunt dici, sicut quomodo prolem producant et alant, quomodo victum sibi comparent, quomodo pro hyeme ventura [provideant], quomodo struant sua domicilia, quomodo cum sociis vivere debeant, regiminis formas norunt, et omnia illa melius quam homo per omnes suas scientias: homo nec opus habuisset scientias artificialiter condere, et eas discere, et tot libros de educatione infantum et liberorum, scribere, praeter innumerabilia alia, si in amore verae fidei esset; at cum solum in cupiditatibus, et quaedam quae fidei sunt separata ab amore [sciat], inde nihil scit, nisi per scientias oretenus vel per libros traditas, quia talia addiscenda sunt, quae sequuntur ab amore. 1748, 24 Nov. </p>
