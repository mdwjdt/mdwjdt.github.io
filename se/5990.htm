<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5990</h4><p>5990. Mention was made also of the organist with whom I had lived, that he too was attacked by them, and that they had wanted to kill him too because he did not to approve of their atrocious dogmas. But for various reasons they had not dared to do so, and it was also said that he had witnesses with him; consequently he was delivered from their fury. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5990</h4><p>5990. It was also mentioned concerning an organist with whom I lived, that he too was infested by them, and that they likewise wished to slay him because he did not approve their abominable dogmas, but that, for many reasons, they did not dare; also, that they had with them those who would have disclosed it. Thus he was delivered from their fury. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5990 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5990. Memoratum etiam de organista apud quem habitavi, quod etiam ille infestatus ab illis, et quod illum quoque voluissent interficere, quia non approbavit illorum nefanda dogmata, sed quod non ausi ex pluribus causis, tum quod secum habuerit testes, sic exemtus est ab illorum furore. </p>
