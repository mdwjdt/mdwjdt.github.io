<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2259</h4><p>2259. The symbolic Church is the body of the Church<p>The Church is like a human being, having a soul and a body, as does heaven also. The symbolic Church, which consisted only of outer observances, represents its body, for which reason it will also die so that the inward Church may come forth, which likewise will die so that the more inward one will come. The Church in its successive stages is arranged like heaven in its entirety. The Lord, Who Alone is Human Being, Heaven and Church, therefore had to fulfill the whole Law, including the outer Law, because everything was symbolic of Him, and looked toward Him.<p>I spoke about these matters with heavenly beings, and they affirmed them. As I write these words, they are also flowing into my hand, as well as into my thought, for it was as though my thinking had been withdrawn. 1748, 10fff1 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2259</h4><p>2259. THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE CHURCH IS THE BODY OF THE CHURCH. <p>The Church, like man, has a soul and a body; it is the same with heaven. The representative Church, which consisted only in externals, resembled its body, wherefore also it must needs die, that an interior Church may come forth; and this likewise, that a more interior [Church may come forth]. It was with the Church successively in time as with heaven at the same time. The Lord, who is alone Man, Heaven, and Church, ought therefore to fulfill all the Law, even the external one, because all things were a representation of Him, and look to Him: I spoke of these things with the celestials, and it was confirmed by them. They also, while I write these things, flow into my hand, as [they did] into my thought, for [my] thought is as it were abstracted. - 1748, June 10. </p>

Quod Ecclesia repraesentativa sit corpus Ecclesiae <sup>1</sup></p><p>Ecclesia se habet sicut homo cum anima et corpore, similiter ac coelum, Ecclesia repraesentativa, quae solum in externis constabat, retulit ejus corpus, quare etiam moritura, ut interior Ecclesia prodiret, et haec pariter ut intimior; se habuit Ecclesia successive in tempore, sicut coelum se habet simul, Dominus Qui est Solus Homo, Coelum et Ecclesia, debuit idcirco implere omnem Legem etiam externam, quia Ipsius repraesentatio fuerunt omnia, ac Ipsum spectant: de his cum coelestibus loquutus, et ab iis confirmatum, qui quoque, cum haec scribo, influunt in manum, sicut in cogitationem, nam cogitatio est quasi abstracta. 1748, 10 <sup>2</sup></p><p>Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;post titulum manu B.
