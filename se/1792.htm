<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1792</h4><p>1792.<p>I was also given occasion to speak with them, and they at once declared that they would take charge, and would teach everything, more than any others. I replied that such spirits are insanities, beginning as they did with fights like these. They spoke with me from higher up, at a middle height, above the forehead. Their speaking was of a kind that I could not judge their intentions from their speech, and that this was their nature; for they were speaking rapidly, and in quite a steady stream. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1792</h4><p>1792. It was granted me to speak with them, when they immediately said that they would rule and teach everything, and far more that any others; to which I replied that such spirits were insanities, beginning, as they did, from angry quarrels and the like. They spoke with me from a superior to a middle altitude above the forehead. Their speech was such that from the speech I could not judge of their minds, that they were of such a quality, for they spoke rapidly, and as in somewhat of a stream. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1792 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1792. Dabatur etiam loqui cum iis, qui statim dicebant, quod ii regerent, et docerent omnia, et plura, quam ulli alii, respondebam, quod tales spiritus insaniae sint, cum incipiant a pugnis et talibus; loquuti sunt mecum a superiori ad mediam altitudinem, supra frontispicium, loquela eorum talis erat, ut ex loquela de eorum animis, quod tales essent, judicare non potuissem, nam celeriter loquebantur, et satis cum flumine. </p>
