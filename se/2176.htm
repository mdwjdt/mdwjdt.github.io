<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2176</h4><p>2176. One should not resolve definitely to do anything that is really unimportant, nor should one desire it ahead of time<p>By much experience within several years, I have been taught that one should not resolve to do anything that is really unimportant, for the reason that one thereby not only loses one's freedom, but also gives spirits an opportunity to desire it, and thus to persuade. For it is the nature of spirits to desire intensely, and then to persuade regarding some matter as if it were a most definite cause, and should by all means be done.<p>For this reason, the Lord sometimes even permits something that He would not have permitted if the person had not resolved to do it, but would instead have given him a conviction and feeling for something good, and for what is conducive to that good thereafter, besides being gifted in this way with freedom, as I have been taught by lengthy experience with spirits. 1748, 3 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2176</h4><p>2176. THAT MAN SHOULD NOT RESOLVE OF A CERTAINTY TO DO AUGHT THAT IS IN ITSELF CONSIDERED A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE, NOR SHOULD IT BE DESIRED BEFOREHAND. <p>I have been instructed by much experience during several years that one should not resolve on doing anything which in itself is a matter of indifference, for the reason that he not only lets go his liberty, but also gives spirits a handle for desiring it, and thus inducing the persuasion thereof; for the nature of spirits is such that they earnestly desire, and induce the persuasion that the matter is most certainly appointed, and must at all events happen. Wherefore does the Lord sometimes permit it. Which He would not have permitted had not man resolved upon it; and in that case the Lord would have given persuasion with an affection to good, and what thereto conduces for the future. Moreover, I have been instructed by daily experience with spirits that thus is he endowed with liberty. - 1748, June 3. </p>

Non sibi aliquid proponendum <sup>1</sup></p><p>pro certo ad faciendum, quod in se indifferens; nec prius cupiendum<p>Per multam experientiam intra aliquot annos edoctus sum, quod non sibi aliquid proponendum facere, quod in se indifferens est, ex causa, quod non solum amittat libertatem, sed etiam det spiritibus ansam cupiendi id, et sic persuadendi, nam spirituum natura est, ut cupiant vehementer, et persuadeant ita, sicut res certissima foret, et quod omnino fieret; quare etiam quandoque a Domino permittitur; quod non permisisset, nisi homo sibi id proposuisset, et tunc dedisset persuasionem cum affectione ad bonum, et [ad id] quod ei conducit in posterum; praeter quod sic quoque libertate donatur, hoc per diutinam experientiam, cum spiritibus, edoctus sum. 1748, 3 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has proponendum </p>
