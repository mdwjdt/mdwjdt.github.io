<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3077</h4><p>3077. Life after death is a life that cannot be compared with the life of the body<p>It has been shown by actual experience that the life of spirits after death can be such that bodily life cannot be compared to it-indeed, by the experience that in one mental image there was as much light and life as in a thousand, and more, of bodily life. And so it was shown that the life of the body with its mental images is so dark that in comparison they are only night. For it is the bodily and sensual elements of the body that bring on the darkness, and persuade that the life of the body is life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3077</h4><p>3077. THAT THE LIFE AFTER DEATH IS A LIFE TO WHICH THE LIFE OF THE BODY CANNOT BE COMPARED. <p>It was shown by living experience, that the life of spirits after death can be of such a nature that the life of the body cannot be compared to it, yea, [was shown] by this that in one idea is as much of life and light as in a thousand, and more of the life of the body, and thus shown, that the life of the body with its ideas is so obscure, as in comparison to be mere darkness; for it is the corporeals and sensuals of the body which obscure, and also persuade that the life of the body is life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3077 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3077. Quod vita post mortem, sit vita, cui non comparari queat vita corporis<p>Ostensum est per vivam experientiam, quod vita spirituum post mortem possit esse talis, ut ei non comparari queat vita corporis, et quidem per id <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quod in una idea tantum lucis et vitae esset quantum in mille et pluribus vitae corporis, et sic ostensum quod vita corporis cum ejus ideis sit tam obscura, ut modo respective tenebrae sint, nam corporea et sensualia corporis sunt quae obscurant, et quoque persuadent quod vita corporis sit vita.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has et vel ea </p>
