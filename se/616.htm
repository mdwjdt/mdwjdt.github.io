<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 616</h4><p>616. From this it is evident that spirits of different earths cannot be together, because they are distinct as to their individual characters, as well as the characters of their societies as a whole. Thus when the Jovian spirits approached and were with me, the spirits here could not bear them, as if they had a strange odor, so they fled away. However, I admitted that I had not smelled it myself, but that it had been a suggestion inspired into me by the spirits of this earth. 1748, 1 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 616</h4><p>616. From this it can be evident that the spirits of different earths cannot be together, because they are separate as to their individual dispositions, and also as to the dispositions of the societies in general; so that when these Jovian spirits approached and were with me, the spirits of this earth could not bear them. It was as though they were of a different odor, for which reason they fled away. I then confessed that I myself had not sensed this, but it was inspired into me by the spirits of this earth. 1748, Feb. 1. </p>

Exinde constare potest, quod spiritus aliarum tellurum non queant simul esse, quia separatae quoad indoles singulares, tum indoles societatum in communi, sic ut dum alluerent et mecum essent <sup>1</sup></p><p>, spiritus hi non possent eos sufferre, sicut quod alius odoris essent, quare aufugerunt: fassus tamen <sup>2</sup></p><p>sum, quod ego id non senserim, sed quod a spiritibus hujus telluris id mihi inspiratum esset. 1748, 1 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has esset<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition tum </p>
