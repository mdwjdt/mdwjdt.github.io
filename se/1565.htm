<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1565</h4><p>1565. But as for sense, such as touch, he said that he did not have that, so spirits have craving, man has sense. I asked him whether he felt along with me when I touched the suit he had so longed for, and he replied that he did not have the sense, but he did have the knowledge of the fact that I was feeling it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1565</h4><p>1565. As to sense, however, as of touch, he said he did not possess it, so that while appetite pertains to spirits, sense or sensation belongs to man. I asked him whether he had a sensation together with mine when I touched the linen for which he so much longed. He said that he had no sensation himself, but he perceived that I had. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1565 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1565. Quod vero ad sensum, sicut tactus, dicebat quod eum non haberet, ita appetitus in spiritibus est, et sensus in homine; quaesivi eum an sentiret id mecum, cum tangerem indusium, quod ita appetebat, respondebat, quod sensum non haberet, sed quod cognitionem ejus, quod ego sentirem. </p>
