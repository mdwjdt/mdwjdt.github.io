<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 972</h4><p>972. When something is being thought in which there is nothing heavenly, then also these same virgins are distressed. This, too, was clearly apparent, and was pointed out, as when I was thinking about earthly matters.<p>It is also reflected in those capsules, for example, if the productive or good element is taken away from the blood by way of the spermatic vessels. After an excessive seizure of this by the spermatics, sadness usually ensues, which may also be caused by this, as well as by the fact that at such a time the better blood to be brought to the heart becomes deficient in the blood stream. 1748, 24 February.<p>972. 1/2. How in the earliest Church they spoke in different languages [see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_10_46.htm">10:46</a>]<p>Because the world is such at this day that it does not want to believe anything but what it understands, and because such things do not occur today as they did in the case of those who spoke in strange languages, I have had occasion to converse with them and question them, and thus to be informed. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See A.W. Acton's footnote, Spiritual Diary, vol 1, p. 269. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 972</h4><p>972. Moreover, when there is thought in which there is something not heavenly, these same virgins are distressed; this was manifestly evident and was also stated. This was the case when I was thinking about earthly things. It is also represented in those [renal] capsules, as if the prolific and good part of the blood were being carried away by the spermatic vessels. After too great a seizure of this by the spermatic vessels, sadness usually follows; the reason for which can be deduced from the fact that in the mass of the blood carried to the heart the better blood becomes deficient. 1748, Feb. 24. <p>[972a.] HOW IN THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH THEY SPOKE IN VARIOUS TONGUES <p>Because at this day the world is such that men are willing to believe nothing but what they understand - nor do such things take place at this day, as took place with those who spoke with other tongues [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>]; x, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_10_46.htm">46</a> - it befell me to converse with and question them, and thus to be informed. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This unnumbered and undated paragraph is written at the top of the last page of this part of the manuscript, on the reverse side of which are nos. <a href="../se/967.htm">967-972</a>. The rest of the page is blank. In Codex 2 it was bound up facing the page on which nos. <a href="../se/201.htm">201-205</a> are written, which explains why it was placed after n. <a href="../se/205.htm">205</a> in the first English Edition. </p>
