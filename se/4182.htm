<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4182</h4><p>4182. About uses<p>The mothers said that my father in bodily life was very often absent, never knowing where next, and always returning with joy. From this I realized that he was sent out by the Lord for various uses with people, now here, now there, because he enjoyed an active life. They also told that without an active life he could not be happy, but that after such activity he could return into his joy. 1749, 26 March. <sup>1</sup>This shows that spirits also are sent out to perform various uses.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4182</h4><p>4182. CONCERNING USES.<p>These mothers said that my father during the life of the body often absented himself, and they knew not where, but that he always returned with a certain delight, from whence it was perceived that he was sent forth by the Lord to the performance of various uses, among his fellow men now here and now there, because his delight consisted in an active life. It was remarked also that without an active life one cannot be in delight; wherefore after such a mission one returns in a state of delight. - 1749, March 26. It hence appears that spirits are sent abroad with a view to various uses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4182 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4182. De usibus<p>Dicebant matres quod pater meus in vita corporis, saepius abesset, et nesciret ubinam, et redire semper cum jucunditate, inde perceptum, quod a Domino ad varios usus, apud homines, nunc huc nunc illuc emitti, quia jucunditas ejus consistit in vita activa, dicebatur etiam quod absque vita activa non in jucunditate esse possit, quare post illam in jucunditatem redit. 1749, 26 Martius. Constat inde quod spiritus ad varios usus, emittantur. </p>
