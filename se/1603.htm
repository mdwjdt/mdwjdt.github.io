<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1603</h4><p>1603. But they have been informed that my philosophical works were nothing else but certain ideas delivered in very simple terms, as when I say that "subject and predicate" means this: that "predicates," or things predicated, must be applied to what is meant by a "subject." For example, when something in the prophets is under consideration, this can be applied to some article of belief, to faith, to the human mind, the very inward as well as the inward one, to the Church, to heaven. Thus whatever is taken up or understood is called the subject, and the other things that are said and are applicable are called predicates, so the predicates are to be applied to the subject.<p>This same thing can also be expressed differently, without such words, and be likewise understood, and later spoken. So they are nothing but true ideas couched in such formulas and terms, being thus a kind of philosophic language, more precise than other language, for otherwise the same matter would have to be expressed by roundabout ways, customary with those unacquainted with those terms - and in fact more clearly, unless the terms spring from the subjects themselves. It is the same in regard to other inquiries, such as what "form" is, what "quality" is, and the like, which are only mental images of truths, useful to those who want to express inward, and very inward things by shortcuts. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1603</h4><p>1603. But they were instructed that my philosophical works were nothing else than certain ideas pronounced in simpler terms, as when I speak of subject and object, and what each signifies; as, for instance, that the predicates or the things which are predicated ought to be applied to that which is signified by the subject; as when something in the prophets is treated of it can be applied to a certain article of faith, to faith, to the more interior mind of man, to interior things in general, to the Church, to Heaven; thus whatever is there assumed, or understood, is called subject, and the other things that are said and are applicable are called predicates, so that the predicates are to be applied to the subject. The same thing might be otherwise expressed without the use of such words; in like manner be understood, and afterwards enounced; wherefore they are only true ideas, which are comprehended under formulas and terms of this nature. It is in fact a certain kind of philosophical speech, but more exquisite than any other, inasmuch as otherwise the same thing would have to be expressed in a circuitous manner, as is customary with those who are unacquainted with those terms. Indeed the philosophical style is the most perspicuous, except when it flows directly from the subject-matter itself. Thus too in other things, as, for instance, in respect to what form is, what quality is, and the like, which are merely ideas of truths subserving the purposes of those who would express prior and intimate things in a brief manner. </p>
