<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4299</h4><p>4299. About hope<p>It has been shown in many ways that the life of evil spirits consists of passions, and that to the degree that they are removed from their passions, so far they are from their life, for which reason also, in order that they may live, and may be prepared for some use, it is granted them at times to abide in their passions - indeed, in the hope of committing evil. As long as there is hope of doing some evil, and of being able to do everything they desire, so long they are kept in their own life. This was proven in the presence of spirits who were inspired with the opposite of hope, the notion that they could not achieve what they had in mind. They were held in that thought, whereupon they seemed to be withdrawing, because they were not in their own life, because without hope. To the extent that the hope decreased, to that extent they withdrew. This showed that hope is the continuum of passion. 1749, 6 June. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Mars, meaning Tuesday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4299</h4><p>4299. CONCERNING HOPE.<p>It was shown in a variety of ways that the life of evil spirits consists of cupidities, and as far as they are removed from their life; wherefore in order that they may live, and be prepared for some use, it is granted them at times to abide in cupidities, yea, even in the hope of doing evil, as long as there is any ground for such a hope; it was shown also that they can accomplish whatever they undertake as long as they are held in their own life. This was evinced in the case of spirits who were impressed with an idea contrary to hope, to wit, that they could not effect the object of their thoughts. They were held in that thought, and then seemed to recede, because they were not in their own life, not being in hope; just as much as hope was diminished, so much they receded. Hence it appeared that hope was a continuation of cupidity. - 1749, June 6. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4299 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4299. De spe<p>Quod spirituum malorum vita consistat in cupiditatibus, et quantum a cupiditatibus, tantum a vita sua removeantur, multis ostensum est, quare etiam ut vivant, et ad quendam usum praeparentur datur iis degere quandoque in cupiditatibus suis; imo in spe faciendi malum, quamdiu spes est faciendi malum, et quod possint omnia, tamdiu 328 tenentur in vita sua, ostensum est hoc apud spiritus, quibus injiciebatur contrarium spei, quod non possint efficere, quod cogitabant; tenebantur in illa cogitatione, et tunc recedere videbantur, quia in vita sua non erant, quia non in spe, quantum diminuebatur spes tantum recedebant; inde constabat quod spes sit continuatio cupiditatis. 1749, 6 Junius. </p>
