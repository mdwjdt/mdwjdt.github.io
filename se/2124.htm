Then did they also tell me that by such a dispersion, as by the wind in the atmosphere, everything was reduced to order; for, however dissolved, they are still reassembled by the Lord at His own good pleasure. This also it was given me to apprehend, by a spiritual idea, that when these things that maliciously conspire are dispersed, then are they reassembled by the Lord according to order. </p>
