<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4012</h4><p>4012.<p>He showed me how he had been doubled up. Whether he had been folded up I did not know, because I was sleeping. He displayed a snow white brain, as white as the cooked [flesh of an] animal, in which there was a little blood, afterwards more, and presently more yet, so that at last there was scarcely anything else visible but blood. From this I realized that he had been thus folded up painfully, because he had a hard callus. I spoke with him, and then he complained that he had lost all that was his, but there was something guiltless which then spoke, hardly knowing what it was saying, portrayed by a bird in which a lamb was obscurely visible. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4012</h4><p>4012. He showed me how he had been punished by the wrenching process, as to which, from being asleep, I was ignorant of his having undergone it. He exhibited a snow-white brain similar in its hue to that of an animal when cooked, in which there was a little blood, afterwards more, and presently more yet, so that at last there was scarcely anything else visible but blood. From this I perceived that he had been painfully tortured in the way just mentioned, especially as a hardened callosity was manifest about him. When I spoke with him he complained that he had lost everything he had possessed; but in saying this he had become, as it were, a babbling infant, not knowing what he said. He was also represented by a bird in which was obscurely seen a lamb. - 1748, November 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4012 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4012. Ostendebat mihi is quomodo plicatus, num plicatus ita non novi, quia dormivi, ostendebat niveum cerebrum, sicut dum niveum est coctum animalis, in quo paucum sanguinis, mox plus sanguinis, mox adhuc plus, ut vix nisi sanguis, ita percepi quod cum dolore ita plicatus sit, quia callus ei durus, loquutus cum eo, tunc conquestus quod amiserit omnia sua, sed insons erat quoddam quod tunc loquutum vix sciens quid loqueretur, repraesentatum per avem, in qua agnus, in obscuro. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
