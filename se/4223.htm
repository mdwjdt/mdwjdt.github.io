<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4223</h4><p>4223. I realized that the angels are not concerned about anything else in people than their motives. When a motive looking to self and the world comes up in a person, then they set themselves against it, and remove it as far as they are able, turning it into a good motive, and when a good motive arises, then they are delighted. Insofar as there is a good motive, so far they are present, and insofar as there is an evil motive, they take distance. But still, by the Lord they are empowered to turn the latter away from casting themselves headlong into the greatest evils, and this by arousing outer restraints that have become familiar to them. 1749, 15 April. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4223</h4><p>4223. It was perceived that the angels care for nothing else with man than his ends; if his end is self and the world, they then oppose it, and remove it, as far as can be done, and turn it into an end of good, in which case they are greatly delighted. So far as an end of good prevails, so far they are present, and so far as an end of evil prevails, so far are they absent or remote. Still they are prompted by the Lord to withhold man from precipitating himself into the greatest evils, which they do by means of external bonds that excite and influence him, and which at length become familiar with him. - 1749, April 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4223 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4223. Perceptum, quod angeli nihil aliud curent quam fines apud hominem, cum finis propter se et propter mundum apud hominem, tunc adversantur, et removent, quantum possunt, et vertunt in finem boni; cum finis boni, tunc delectantur; quantum finis boni tantum adsunt, et quantum finis mali tantum remoti sunt; sed usque a Domino avertunt ne homo praecipitet se in maxima mala, per vincula externa, quae excitant, et quae familiaria facta apud hominem. 1749, 15 April. </p>
