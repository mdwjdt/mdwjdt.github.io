<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6044</h4><p>6044. About those who are caught up in faith alone<p>I spoke with Jac[ob] Benzel[ius] <sup>1</sup>about faith alone and said that the summary of all things of faith today is that from faith and trust they believe that Christ was sent by the Father, and that through the passion of the cross He redeemed us. And I said that there is not an element of truth in this summary and in this confession, but that those who have convinced themselves of this hold false beliefs. He acknowledged this, and so that he might know it was true he was sent into the flatlands and was kept in this belief, and he then saw nothing but sand and pebbles, and nothing green at all. He searched but found nothing. Green symbolizes that there is something of truth. He told it to others, and when he thought of proofs of this summary, snakes then appeared that wanted to fly at his feet. From this he was convinced by experience itself that there is nothing true in this faith. But at a distance flatlands appeared where those who held a similar faith were living. They had grass, shrubs and trees, and buildings where they were dwelling. They had a cheerful frame of mind. They were also diligent in their work. But they professed that they had only known this confession; however, they had not given thought to it beyond the sense of the letter of the Word. And because they had not gone further in their thinking, they had even been able to accept some truths. And they said they certainly had thought about God in their life.</p><p>[2] After this J. B. was greatly grieved, wanting to accept truths and so reject false beliefs, but he was unable to do so because false beliefs and evils coming from them stood in the way, because when these are in the mind, no truths can enter. And because a person becomes entirely like the false and evil things within him, it was said that those who are caught up in such things cannot think other than what is false and evil about Divine things, or rather, cannot lead a moral and civil life; since these form a person's understanding and will. In addition he said that he is amazed that people do not think about God and about eternal life while in the world, when yet they become to eternity such as they had been thinking, and those who are caught up in falsities which arise from evil and in evils which arise from falsity cannot be in any society of heaven. He said also that he is miserably housed, miserably clothed, and miserably fed, and must live in hell with persons like this, who had been criminal; consequently he lives in constant misery.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For information on this person see footnote to passage <a href="5004.htm">5004</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6044</h4><p>6044. THOSE WHO ARE IN FAITH ALONE. <p>I spoke [with] Jac[ob] Benzel[ius] concerning faith alone, and said that, at the present day, the summing up of the faith of all is, that, from trust and confidence, they believe that Christ was sent by the Father, and that He redeemed us through the passion of the cross; also, that in that summary and in that creed there is not a particle of truth, and that with those who confirm themselves in them these things are falsities. He acknowledged this; and, in order that he might know that it was so, he was sent into the plains, and was held in that faith; and then he saw nothing but sand and stones, and no grass at all. He sought, but found none. Grass signifies somewhat of truth. He mentioned this to others; and when he thought about the confirmations of that summary [of faith], then serpents appeared, which wanted to fly at his feet: hence he was convinced, by experience itself, that there is nothing whatever of truth in that faith. Plains, however, in which dwelt some who were in the like faith, appeared at a distance: these had grass, shrubs and trees, and buildings wherein they dwelt. They were joyful in mind, and were industrious in their labors; but they acknowledged that they only knew that creed, but had not thought beyond the sense of the letter of the Word; and, inasmuch as they did not go deeper than this in their thought, they were also able to receive some truths: [they said] also, that, still, they had thought of God in their life. Afterwards, J[acob] B[enzelius] was deeply grieved, being desirous of receiving truths, and thus of rejecting falsities, but unable to do so because falsities and evils therefrom hindered - for, when these are in the mind, no truths at all can enter - also, because the whole man becomes such as he is from his falsities and evils. It was likewise stated that he who is in such, is able to think, [even] about Divine things, nothing save falsities and evils - yea, nor yet in moral and civil life, inasmuch as these form his understanding and will. He said, moreover, that it is astounding that man does not think of God and eternal life while in the world, when yet he becomes such [as he is in the world] to eternity: and those who are in the falsities of evil and in the evils of falsity, cannot be in any society of heaven; also, that he is miserably lodged, miserably clothed, and miserably fed, and he must live in hell with such as were infamous, thus continually in misery. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6044 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6044. De illis qui in sola fide<p>Loquutus sum [cum] Jac. Benzel. de sola fide, et dixi quod summarium omnium fidei sit hodie, quod ex fiducia et confidentia credant, quod Christus missus sit a Patre et quod per passionem crucis redemerit nos, et quod in illo summario et in illa confessione nihil veri sit, sed quod falsa sint illa iis qui confirmant se in eo. Ille agnovit, et ut sciret quod ita esset, missus in campestria, et tenebatur in illa fide, et tunc non vidit nisi arenosa et scrupulos, et prorsus nihil graminis, quaerebat, sed non inveniebat, gramen significat aliquid veri, hoc dixit aliis, et cum cogitavit de confirmationibus illius summarii, tunc apparebant serpentes, qui in pedes ejus involare volebant; inde ex ipsa experientia convictus est, quod prorsus nihil veri illi fidei insit. - Sed e longinquo apparebant campestria, ubi habitabant qui in simili fide, illis erant gramen, virgulta, et arbores, et aedificia in quibus habitabant, erant hilares animo, erant quoque seduli in suis operis, sed confessi sunt quod solum sciverint illam confessionem sed non ultra sensum literae Verbi cogitaverint; et quia non ulterius cogitatione iverunt, illi etiam aliqua vera potuerunt recipere; tum quod usque de Deo cogitaverint in vita sua.<p>[2] Postea J. B. maximopere indoluit, volens recipere vera, et sic rejicere falsa, sed non potuit, quia falsa et inde mala obstabant, quae cum in mente sunt, non intrare possunt aliqua vera, tum quia homo fit totus qualis est ex falsis et malis, et dictum quod qui in talibus est, non potest de Divinis cogitare quam falsa et mala, imo nec in vita morali et civili, quoniam illa faciunt intellectum et voluntatem ejus; insuper dixit, quod mirum sit quod homo non cogitet de Deo et de vita aeterna in mundo, cum tamen talis fit in aeternum, et qui in falsis mali et in malis falsi sunt non in aliqua societate coeli possint esse, et quod habitet misere, amiciatur misere, et nutriatur misere, et cum talibus in inferno victurus est, qui scelerati fuerunt, ita continuo miseria. </p>
