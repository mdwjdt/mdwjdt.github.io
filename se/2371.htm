<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2371</h4><p>2371. Thoughts of spirits that are only convictions were not as readily discerned as those which had been passions<p>There are two things that rule minds, convictions and feelings. Convictions when they had only been in the spirits' thoughts, I did not discern, but when there are passions and feelings, these show themselves easily, for they move a person. Therefore, at times they have even spoken with me as it were by pure emotions and variations thereof, thus entirely tacitly, without any voice. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2371</h4><p>2371. THAT THE COGITATIONS OF SPIRITS, WHICH ARE ONLY PERSUASIONS, ARE NOT PERCEIVED IN THE SAME MANNER AS [THOSE THOUGHTS] WHICH WERE CUPIDITIES. <p>There are two things which rule minds, [viz.] persuasions and affections. When only persuasions were in the thought of spirits they were not perceived by me; but when cupidities and affections [are] [therein], they easily manifest themselves, for they affect; wherefore they, as it were, spoke with me on several occasions by mere cupidities and their variations therefore, wholly in a tacit manner, without any voice. </p>

Quod cogitationes spirituum, quae modo persuasiones sunt, non ita perceptae sint, ac quae fuerunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>cupiditates<p>Sunt bina, quae regunt mentes: persuasiones et affectiones; persuasiones dum solum in cogitatione spirituum fuerunt, non perceptae fuerunt a me, sed cum cupiditates et affectiones, eae se facile manifestant, nam afficiunt, quare etiam aliquoties per meras cupiditates, et earum variationes, mecum quasi loquuti sunt, ita prorsus tacite, absque ulla voce.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has fueunt </p>
