<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2874</h4><p>2874. they are as they are, and he is as he is, they have themselves to blame, and that they were born - not only the faithless Jews, but also the vast majority of Christians, who do not believe either, as well as the whole evil world-this was foreseen, and because they were of this character, one was born to be a remedy to the other, for evil is cured by evil, as is well known in the case of temptations and other like states.<p>Because this was foreseen, it could not happen differently. Since the world was born of this character and this was the only possibility for the sake of the ultimate and best purpose, it follows that whoever speaks and feels differently, speaks against the Divine. By means of spiritual mental imagery that was also inspired into me at the time, these points were better understood, and confirmed by way of heaven. 1748, 21 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2874</h4><p>2874. Wherefore that they are of such a character, and he is of such a character is to be attributed to themselves; and that there were born not only infidel Jews, but also the greatest part of Christians, who do not believe as also the whole evil world, this is provided, and because they are such one should be born so as to be a remedy for another, for evil is cured by evil, like as is known in temptations and other similar things, which because provided, it could not have happened differently. Since the world was born of such a character, and it was so only on account of a last and best end, it follows, that he who speaks and feels otherwise, speaks against [what is] Divine. These things were better understood through spiritual ideas, which were then also inspired into me, and have been confirmed from heaven. - 1748, August 21. </p>
