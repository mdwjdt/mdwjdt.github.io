<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 779</h4><p>779. Once while a spirit was sleeping, I was awake and paying little attention to his sleep. Then there was another spirit who was sleeping and displayed what that spirit was feeling. At the same time there were also angels, who were inspiring this dream, who are always awake. Therefore, dreams like this one come from heaven, and there are angels who cause them, from the Lord, and there are other spirits who then believe they are enacting [the dream]. I even heard how this spirit was working, and what was being said. 1748, 15 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 779</h4><p>779. When a spirit was sleeping, I was awake, and I paid little attention to his sleep. There was then another spirit who was asleep, and he represented what the other spirit was feeling. There were also angels who are always vigilant, and who insinuated this dream; wherefore such dreams come from heaven, and there are angels who bring them about from the Lord. There are also other spirits who then suppose that they act in this manner. I also heard how this spirit acted, and what was said. 1748, Feb. 15. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 779 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>779. Quando spiritus etiam dormivit, vigil eram, et paulo attendebam ad somnum ejus, erat tunc alius spiritus, qui in somno erat et repraesentabat, quod spiritus sentiebat, tum etiam erant angeli, qui somnium hoc insinuabant, qui vigiles semper sunt, quare similia somnia ex coelo veniunt, et angeli sunt, qui ex Domino, ea efficiunt, et sunt alii spiritus qui tunc ita putant agere: quem spiritum etiam audivi, quomodo ageret, et quid diceretur. 1748, 15 Febr. </p>
