<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2673</h4><p>2673. Such is the life that is in them, and when they become used to such a life, they not only suppose that no other light of life exists, preferring it to the real light, but they also prefer the pleasure they have from it above heavenly happiness, because they do not see otherwise than that it is that happiness - just as worms in their darkness consider it to be the highest light and pleasure.<p>I was also prompted to portray to them what their life would be by the withdrawal of pleasure from that life. This was done by a spiritual mental image, in which there lingered before them something foul, extremely ugly, concordant with the quality of that life. And such do they become in the other life when the pleasure of that life is taken from them. Then they are effigies of death, so ugly that the ugliness cannot be described to anyone. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2673</h4><p>2673. Which fire, or the obscure [light] [lumen] hence appearing, appeared in spiritual idea [as something] sad. Such a life is in them; and [those] who are accustomed to such a life not only suppose, that no other light of life is given than such [a one], preferring it to light itself as also the pleasantness hence, [but also] prefer it to heavenly felicity, because they do not perceive otherwise, because they are in such [light], just as also glowworms [tineoe] in their darkness [caligine] suppose there is the highest light and pleasantness. It was also granted to represent, of what nature their life would be, by abstraction of pleasantness from such a life. This was done in spiritual idea. Then remains before them such a thing as is hideous [tetrum] [and] most deformed, according to the quality of that life, and such they become in the other life, when such pleasantness of life is taken from them, thus they are an effigy of death; so deformed, that the deformity cannot be described to anyone. </p>
