<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3259</h4><p>3259. as it occurs, they remember. This shows quite clearly that the memory of spirits and angels is much more perfect than that of people on earth, and that they retain whatever they hear, see, perceive. And all the more the spirits of Mercury, because they delight in and avidly desire those things, for which reason also more reflection is adjoined to them than with other spirits. For eagerness, or curiosity, and the love of such things produces reflection. It is different with those who do not care for such details, with whom they pass away, yet inwardly still remain, as with angelic spirits and angels, because these delight in the thinking of judgment, and in the resulting use. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3259</h4><p>3259. Although they are not aware that they know [a thing], yet as soon as it occurs, they remember it. Hence it may be quite clearly manifest, that the memory of spirits and angels is much more perfect than the memory of men, and that they retain whatever they hear, see [and] perceive; and still more the spirits of Mercury, because they delight in these things, and earnestly desire them; wherefore there is also adjoined [to them] more reflection than [occurs] with others; for avidity or curiosity, and the love of such things produces reflection. It is different with those who do not care for such things. In their case such things are transient, but yet remain [impresseo] still interiorly, as is the case with angelic spirits and angels, because they delight in the thought of judgment, or use hence derived.) </p>
