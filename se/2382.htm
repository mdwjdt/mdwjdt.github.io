<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2382</h4><p>2382. Those who are far off hear and discern what is being thought, and the things I said, more keenly than those nearer by<p>I spoke with those who were far off, and in fact very high overhead, thus farther away than the rest. They were saying that they discerned the things I thought and said better than those closer by, or than when they were closer. I too was convinced, because it is like those who are too close to some very loud sounding [voice], and take in too much of the sound, which drowns out the meaning of the words. While those farther away are only hearing what it is about, which the sound is not drowning out. They said they could make out the very details, and actually understand them. 1748, 22 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2382</h4><p>2382. THAT THOSE WHO ARE AFAR OFF HEAR AND PERCEIVE MORE EXQUISITELY WHATEVER IS THOUGHT, AND WHATEVER I SPEAK, THAN THOSE WHO WERE NEARER. <p>I spoke with those who were afar off and, indeed, very high above the head, therefore farther off than the rest. They said that they perceived my thoughts and sayings better than those who were nearer, or better than when they [themselves] are nearer. I was also persuaded [of the fact] because they are circumstanced like what is nearer to any loud sound which [qui I think should be quoe] take up more of the sound by which the sense of the words is carried off. But those who are afar off only attend to the thing, and the sound does not thus carry away [the sense]. They said they perceived the more minute things, and indeed with the intellect. - 1748, June 22. </p>
