<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2743</h4><p>2743. Because they had loved nothing better than this in their bodily life, they easily appropriate arts unknown in bodily life or to those in the body, so they are like sponges put into water. They at once suck out of a person with whom they are present and spirits with whom they are, anything they can use to obtain these goals, at the same time also turning goods into evils. They are like poisonous animals, like scorpions, which, when ground up and mixed with oil, at once absorb all the poison from a wound, and so on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2743</h4><p>2743. Such [spirits] inasmuch as in the life of the body they have loved nothing more than such things, take parts unknown to them whilst in the life of the body, or to those who are in the body, as easily as if they were sponges put in the water, so that they immediately suck [exseegant] from the man with whom they are present, or the spirits with whom they are nothing else but such things: from whomsoever they can obtain these things, moreover they also turn goods into evils. They are as it were venomous animals like scorpions, from which when pounded up and mixed with oil, they immediately snatch to themselves every poison that wounds [vulneris], etc. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2743 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2743. Tales quia in vita corporis nihil prius amaverint quam talia, tam facile arripiunt artes, in vita corporis seu iis qui in corpore, ignotas, ut sint quasi spongiae, appositae ad aquas, ut illico non aliud exsugunt homini, cui adsunt, et spiritibus, cum quibus sunt, quam talia, ex quibus ea {a} obtinere possint, tum quoque bona vertunt in mala; sunt sicut venenosa animalia, sicut scorpii, ex quibus contritis et oleo mixtis, ad se arripiunt illico omne venenum vulneris, et sic porro. </p>
