The following scene was displayed concerning them: a woman was seen near me with her back toward me, facing a kitchen fireplace, where I saw a fire burning.

Next I saw a woman with her head dressed, having a rather wide womanly covering of a purple color, lying in a bed before the table.</p><p>[2] After a brief interval, there was seen a left footsole, from which some flesh was cut without the skin, the raw incised flesh appearing, and in fact near the big toe of the foot, which had not yet been skinned.

After a short interval the sole of the left foot on which the flesh was cut and skinless appeared; the raw flesh [distinctly] appeared as if a cutting had been made; the seat of it was the foot near the great toe, which however was not excoriated. Afterwards little dogs appeared running to me but what these things signified I do not yet know. - 1748, October 27, 28.
