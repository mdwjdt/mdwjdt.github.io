<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2911</h4><p>2911. I was let back for the space of a little hour into almost my original state<p>While I was walking on the street, I was let back into almost the original state, so that I was not speaking or thinking among spirits, although the state continued of being among good spirits, but not evil ones. And I observed how a person is then bent by the Lord away from passions through convictions arising from uses-thus into passions by the evil, and out of passions by the good, and I was given to realize how easily this happened in that state. Evil spirits could not stream in without being at once bent [away]. 1748, 24 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2911</h4><p>2911. THAT I WAS REMITTED FOR NEARLY THE SPACE OF AN HOUR [intra horulae spatium] INTO ALMOST MY ORIGINAL STATE. <p>When I passed along the street, I was remitted into almost my former state: so as not to speak or think amongst spirits: yet there remained the state, [whereby] I could be present with good spirits, but not with evil, and I observed how man is thus bended by the Lord, from cupidities, through persuasion [arising] from uses: thus [he is brought] into cupidities by the evil, and from cupidities through the good, which it was even me to apperceive [for it] was very easy in that state [to perceive it]. Evil spirits could not inflow, without [them all] being immediately bended. - 1748, August 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2911 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2911. Quod remissus intra horulae spatium in statum fere pristinum<p>Cum in platea irem, remissus eram in statum fere pristinum, sic ut non loquerer aut cogitarem inter spiritus, usque status remansit, ut interessem bonis spiritibus, non item malis, et observavi quomodo homo sic flectitur a Domino, a cupiditatibus, per persuasionem <sup>1</sup></p><p>ex usibus, ita in cupiditates a malis, et e cupiditatibus per bonos, quod quam facile erat in eo statu, appercipere mihi dabatur, spiritus mali non potuerunt influere, quin illico flecteretur. 1748, 24 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
