<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4435</h4><p>4435. About mutual love, that from it comes all happiness<p>Mutual love [is] from marriage love<p>There were spirits who were doubting that all happiness comes from mutual love, desiring to know whether this is so. They were let into a certain state of mutual love, located toward the front at some distance, and at a middle altitude, and from there they spoke with me. They declared that they were feeling happiness such as they would never have believed possible, and from there they were preaching how great it is, not wishing to return from there into their former state.<p>There were then some other spirits, who could not be brought into that state, sent near to that place, who said that they felt nothing - this being done so that it might be known what the one and the other type of spirits were like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4435</h4><p>4435. CONCERNING MUTUAL LOVE, THAT ALL HAPPINESS IS THENCE, [AND] THAT MUTUAL LOVE IS FROM CONJUGIAL LOVE.<p>There were [some] spirits who doubted that all happiness was from mutual love; they desired to know whether it was so. They were [therefore] sent into a certain state of mutual love [to a place] in front at a distance, [and] in a middle altitude, and spoke with me thence. They said that they perceived a happiness, which they could never have believed [possible], and proclaimed thence how great it was, being unwilling to return thence into their former state. There were there other spirits who could not be reduced to that state, who were sent thither near them, [and who] said that they felt nothing; this was done that the quality of the one and of the other might be known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4435 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4435. De amore mutuo quod inde omnis felicitas<p>Quid amor mutuus a conjugiali<p>Fuerunt spiritus qui dubitabant de eo, quod ex amore mutuo omnis felicitas, desiderabant scire num ita esset, missi in statum quendam amoris mutui, antrorsus ad distantiam in altitudine media, et inde loquuti mecum, dicebant quod felicitatem perciperent quam nusquam crederent, et inde eam praedicabant quanta sit, nolentes inde redire in statum pristinum; erant tunc alii spiritus, qui non redigi potuerunt in eum statum, prope illuc missi, dicebant quod nihil sentiant, hoc factum ut sciretur qualis unus et alter. </p>
