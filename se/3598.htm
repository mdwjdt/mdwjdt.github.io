<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3598</h4><p>3598. From this it is evident that the world that is called Christian is something like the cunning antediluvian operating invisibly and incognito, and definitely out of almost the same persuasiveness. So their life is similar, namely, a wintry one; likewise that the world called Christian is worse than that of the people before the flood in this respect, that they regard adulteries as nothing, and when adulteries are accounted as nothing it follows that they have nothing that savors of love, and they desire to destroy societies, because they are opposed to them; besides which they are cruel, for adulteries have this with them. For if only a single adulterous act is present, they are leaning toward cruelty. For example, those in Italy, where even monks steal in among wives more than others, it is quite obvious that they are cruel, in fact out of vengeance, extremely cruel. 1748, 17 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3598</h4><p>3598. It hence appears that what is called the Christian world is almost of the character of the antediluvian, deceitful, acting invisibly and, covertly, and indeed from a similar persuasion wherefore their life is similar, viz., the life of winter. Indeed the world called Christian is in this respect worse than the antediluvian, that it accounts adulteries as nothing; and when adulteries are accounted as nothing, it follows that they have nothing which savors of love, and they wish to destroy societies because they are contrary to them; hence too they become cruel, which is inseparable from adulteries; for the result of a single adulterous act is a proneness to cruelty. Thus in Italy, where the monks [licentiously] insinuate themselves among married women, nothing is more obvious than that they become vindictively cruel. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3598 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3598. Exinde constat, quod mundus qui Christianus vocatur talis fere est ut antediluvianus dolosus, invisibiliter et incognito agens, et quidem ex persuasione paene simili, quare vita eorum est similis, nempe vita hyemis: tum quod mundus qui Christianus vocatur, in eo antediluvianis pejor sit, quod adulteria pro nihilo aestimant; et cum adulteria pro nihilo, sequitur, quod nihil quod audit amoris, et societates perdere cupiant, quia iis contrarii; praeter quod crudeles sint, adulteria quoque hoc secum habent; nam modo actualitas una adest, in crudelitatem proni sunt: sicut qui Italiae, ubi etiam monachi se insinuant apud uxores prae aliis, qui quod crudeles sint, immo ex vindicta crudelissimi, satis constat. 1748, 17 Oct. </p>
