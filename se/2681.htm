<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2681</h4><p>2681. About the Aura of those who regard others as nothing<p>Someone who had been great in life and seemed to himself to be wise beyond others, was raised up from the foot-sole, where he had been, into the realm above and near the head, and around the front parts toward a group of spirits. Because in life he, together with his associates, had been the kind who regarded others as nothing, but himself as greater and wiser than all mortals, and because he was adored as such by those under him, he brought along that earthly character that emanates an aura.<p>The effect of the aura was that first something like a white veil was twisting around in the atmosphere, which soon became to them like a dense mist, like a sea of mist that covered them over, and crying out they said they are being submerged and could not struggle out, but the mist covered them over. After that they said that they are in such trouble that they could not live, knowing that an aura having such an effect exhaled from him.<p>In this way he caused grave trouble for those who wanted to live licentiously. Such figures are also to be found in everyday life, unless they are kings, toward whom there is not familiarity, but adoration. He also spoke with them, instructing them in matters of life with a gravity like that of Solomon, so I am told. 1748, 25 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2681</h4><p>2681. CONCERNING THE SPHERE OF THOSE WHO REGARD OTHERS AS OF NO ACCOUNT. <p>(A certain one, who because during life he seemed great, and wiser than others, when he was raised up from the sole of the foot, where he was into the sphere above the head, near the head, and about anteriors towards many from the sole of the foot, where he was into the sphere above spirits, he, because during life he was of such a character, with his associates, as regarded others as of no account, but himself [regarded as] greater and wiser than all mortals, and because reverenced for such a one, by those who were beneath him, [hence[ derived the natural disposition from which [his] sphere [flows]. The effect of [his] sphere was [this]: first it was bent out like a white sail in the atmosphere; next was as it were a dense rain-cloud [nimbus] as it were, a sea of clouds [mare nimbosum], which covered them up. They cried out and said that they are drowned, and could not struggle out: but the cloud covered them up. They said afterwards that they are in such trouble, that they could not live: they know that such a sphere as produced that effect exhaled from him. Thus he caused grievous trouble to them who wished to live in license. Such also are in the common [general] life unless they are Kings, with whom there [can be] no familiarity but respect [adoration] [must be shown them]. He also spoke with them, instructive things [pertaining] to life with such gravity as Solomon might have done: so I was told. - 1748, July 25.) </p>

De Sphaera eorum, qui alios aestimant pro nihilo<p>Quidam, qui in vita, quia magnus, et prae caeteris sapiens sibi visus, cum sublatus a planta pedes, ubi fuit, in sphaeram super caput prope caput, et circum anteriora versus spiritus <sup>1</sup></p><p>plures, is quia in vita talis fuit, cum ejus associatis, ut pro nihilo aestimaverit alios, sed semet majorem et sapientiorem omnibus mortalibus, et quia adoratus pro tali, ab iis qui subter se, traxit naturalem eam indolem, unde sphaera; sphaerae effectus erat, quod primum circumflecteretur sicut velum album in atmosphaera, mox erat iis quasi nimbus crassus, quasi mare nimbosum, quod obvelabat eos, et clamantes dicebant, quod immergantur, nec potuerunt eniti, sed nimbus obvelabat <sup>2</sup></p><p>eos: postea dicebant, quod in tali molestia sint, ut vivere nequirent, scientes quod ab eo talis sphaera, quae talem effectum haberet, exhalaret; sic causatus est molestiam gravem iis, qui in licentia vellent vivere; tales etiam sunt in vita communi, nisi sint reges, cum quibus non familiaritas, sed adoratio; loquutus quoque est cum iis, instructiva vitae cum tali gravitate; quod fuerit Salomo, mihi dictum. 1748, 25 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has versus, spiritus<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has obvelebat </p>
