<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4864</h4><p>4864. About spiritual reproduction, like that of peoples and families, thus about heaven with a person<p>The angels with me were shown how [spiritual] reproduction occurred, somewhat like that of peoples and of families, of one house from another, and that they were separate events, and that there were a great number of them, in a long series, so that the derivations were almost like those of children, grandchildren, and subsequent relatives in series, and that all the souls were separate from each other.<p>This exploration and examination of the family-like derivations went on for a quarter of an hour. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4864</h4><p>4864. CONCERNING SPIRITUAL GENERATION, AS IT WERE, OF RACES AND FAMILIES: THUS CONCERNING HEAVEN WITH MAN.<p>It was shown by the angels with me, how the generations, as it were, of [spiritual] races and families occurred, that one house was derived from another, and that they were distinct. This [was shown] with much fullness, and in a long succession, thus that the derivations were almost like those of [natural] children, grandchildren and relatives, following in unbroken series, and that all souls were distinct from each other. That exploration and examination of the derivation, as it were, of [spiritual] families, lasted for a quarter of an hour. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4864 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4864. De generatione spirituali sicut gentium et familiarum, ita de coelo apud hominem<p>Angelis ostendebatur apud me quomodo generationes factae sint sicut gentium et familiarum, unius domus ab altera, et quod separatae essent, et hoc in multa amplitudine et in longa serie, sic ut derivationes essent similes, quasi liberorum, nepotum, et affinium consequentium in serie, et quod animae omnes inter se separatae essent. Exploratio illa et perlustratio derivationis sicut familiarum perstabat ad quadrantem horae. </p>
