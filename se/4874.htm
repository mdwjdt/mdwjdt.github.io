<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4874</h4><p>4874. It was told that he knows from the hells situated around him that spirits are arriving and what they are thinking. And it was asked how the hells know this. They replied that they look up at the stars and from there have revelation, and also from there a clear view round about, and also from there the urge to destroy [the arriving spirits] in whatever way they can. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4874</h4><p>4874. It was related that he knows, from the circumjacent hells, that spirits are approaching, and what they are thinking of; and it was inquired how the hells could know that. They then answered that they look upwards to the stars and have a revelation thence; and likewise their sight is thence opened round about, and they also have encouragement, from thence, to destroy those [who approach] in whatever way they can. </p>

Narrabatur quod ille ex circumjacentibus infernis sciat, quod spiritus adveniant, et quid cogitent, et inquisitum quomodo inferna id scirent, tunc respondebant quod spectent sursum ad stellas, et quod illis inde revelatio, et quoque inde visus apertus circumcirca, et quoque inde hortatio, ut perdant illos quocunque modo possint. </p>
