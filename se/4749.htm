<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4749</h4><p>4749. Another whose outward [characteristics] were full of pride but whose inner ones were good was (Er[ik] Benz[elius] <sup>1</sup>). He, when in the world, esteemed himself above all others, was contemptuous of all others in comparison with himself except for one who had a more powerful memory than he. He put all learning and wisdom in [having a good] memory. His involvement with the doctrine of the Church was from (facts in his) memory, and not at all from himself, and because he was such, it was not possible for him to contaminate his inner self. He suffered hard things at first in the other life. Surrounding his cerebrum there appeared to be something like a bony callus. It was broken in pieces with great pain several times, and then he was brought back to his inner qualities, which were good. And he was then like a little child. He was taught by the angels in a way accommodated to him.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Erik Benzelius the Younger (1675ֱ743), brother-in-law of the author, librarian and professor of theology at the University of Uppsala; later Bishop of Linkoping. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4749</h4><p>4749. There was another whose exteriors were full of haughtiness, but his interiors good. It was (Ericus Benzelius). <sup>1</sup>He, in the world, placed himself before all others; he despised all others in comparison with himself, except one who excelled him in memory; he placed everything learned and wise in memory; he was in the doctrine of the Church from memory and not from himself; and, being of such a character, he was not permitted to defile his internal. He at first suffered hardships in the other life. There appeared about the cerebrum, as it were a bony skin, which was several times broken with great pain; and then he was brought into his interiors, which were good, and was then like an infant. He was instructed, by angels, in a mode accommodated to him.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Dr. Achatius Kahl, in his Narratiunculoe (page 9) and the Rev. Prof. R. L. Tafel, in his Documents (Vol. I., p. 608) consider this Ericus Benzelius to be younger of the two men who bore that name. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4749 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4749. Alter, cujus exteriora erant fastu plena, at interiora bona, erat (Er. Benz.), is in mundo se praeferebat omnibus aliis, contemnebat omnes alios prae se, praeter unum qui memoria polluit prae se, ponebat in memoria omne doctum et sapiens, in doctrina Ecclesiae fuit ex memoria, et nihil ex se, et quia talis, non licuit ei contaminare internum suum; is dura passus est in altera vita primum, apparebat enim circum cerebrum sicut callus osseus, qui cum magno dolore frangebatur aliquoties; et tunc redactus est in interiora sua, quae erant bona, et erat tunc sicut infans, instruebatur ab angelis modo ei accommodato. </p>
