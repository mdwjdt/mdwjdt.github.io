<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>268.人的灵魂被转入天上的喜乐，以看见弥赛亚神的荣耀。今天我亲眼看见两个人，他们生前我就认识他们，我还与他们交谈；后来话题转到天上的喜乐，即与天上的喜乐相比，死后与人交谈什么都不是。然后，这两个人被带到更内在的天堂，进入那里的某个住所。他们从那里，仿佛从高处与我说话；尽管只是从一个更内在的天堂与我说话。他们见证说，这种喜乐是无法形容的，相比之下，地上和世俗的快乐什么都不是。（1747年11月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 268</h4><p>268. Human souls are transferred into heavenly joy, to see the glory of God the Messiah<p>Today I witnessed two people I had known in life and with whom I had been speaking - after the conversation had turned to the subject of heavenly joy, and the fact that the delight of talking with a person after death was nothing compared to the joy in the heavens - transferred into the very inward heaven, into some habitation of it. From there they spoke with me, now as if from a higher place, while it was only from a more inward one. They testified that such joy is unspeakable, and that compared to it, earthly and worldly delights are nothing. 1747, the 24th day of November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 268</h4><p>268. THE SOULS OF MEN ARE TRANSFERRED INTO HEAVENLY JOY ON SEEING THE GLORY OF GOD MESSIAH <p>There were shown me today two whom I had known during their life, and with whom I conversed; the conversation was concerning heavenly joy, and that the delight of conversing with man after death, was nothing in comparison with the joy in the heavens. These two were then carried away into the more interior heaven, into a certain habitation there, and spoke with me from there then as if from on high; although it was only from the more interior heaven. And they testified that such joy is ineffable, and that terrestrial and worldly delights are nothing in comparison. 1747, Nov. 24, o.s. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 268 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>268. Quod animae hominum transferantur in coeleste gaudium, ad videndum gloriam Dei Messiae<p>Hodie mihi ostensum est, quod bini, quos in vita cognovi, et cum quibus loquutus, postmodum, cum sermo factus de gaudio coelesti, et quod delectatio loquendi cum homine post mortem, nihili esset respectu gaudii in coelis, tunc translati sunt in intimius coelum, in aliquam ejus mansionem, et inde mecum loquuti, quasi tunc ex superiori, cum solum esset ex intimiori, et contestati, quod tale gaudium ineffabile sit, et respectu ejus delectationes terrestres et mundanae, nihili. 1747, die 24 Nov. st. v. </p>
