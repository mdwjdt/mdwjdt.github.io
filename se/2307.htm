<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2307</h4><p>2307. Those who have made a habit of filthy and obscene talking in bodily life retain it in the other life<p>I heard certain spirits who, when some obscene, even filthy subject was raised, could not abstain from blurting out more of the same to the point of offending the ears of others spirits, and who were therefore removed. One of them said he had made a habit of such talk in bodily life, and that nevertheless he was one who could know the truth as well as other spirits. So we must guard against this habit, because it remains, and [the offender] is rejected by [heavenly] societies. 1748, 12 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2307</h4><p>2307. THOSE WHO HAVE HABITUATED THEMSELVES TO SPEAK OBSCENE AND FILTHY THINGS IN THE LIFE OF THE BODY, RETAIN THE LIKE IN THE OTHER LIFE. <p>I have heard of certain spirits, who, when anything obscene, yea, filthy, was excited, could not have abstained therefrom, but babble the like so that it offended the ears of other spirits, some of whom on that account withdrew. A certain one said that he had become accustomed to such things in the life of the body, and yet he was such as could know what was true as well as other spirits; wherefore such a habit should be guarded against, because it remains, and (the offender) is ejected from society. - 1748, June 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2307 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2307. Qui spurca et obscoena loqui in vita corporis assuefecerunt se, in altera vita similia retinent<p>Audivi quosdam spiritus, dum excitaretur aliquod obscoenum, imo spurcum, quod non abstinere potuissent, quin similia effutirent, sic ut laederentur aures aliorum spirituum, quorum quidam ideo remoti sunt; quidam dixit, quod talibus assuefactus in vita corporis, et quod tamen usque talis esset, qui scire quid verum tam bene ac alii spiritus [posset] <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quare cavendum a simili consuetudine, quia remanet, et a societatibus ejicitur. 1748, 12 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
