<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>206.亚伯拉罕不认识我们，如我们所读到的（以赛亚书63:16），天使也不认识我们。很长一段时间以来，我一直以为至内在和较为内在的天使知道我在做什么、想什么，因为我认为，说谎灵人的邪恶意图和欺骗不断被压制是他们所为。但蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，当我有几次被允许与其他人交谈，他们将那些天使的想法传给我时，他们说，那些天使根本不像离我最近的灵人那样知道我在做什么或看什么；不过，他们仍不断对恶灵的努力和行为，也就是其气场作出反应；他们对气场感觉最为敏锐，只是不知道这气场出于什么原因，或来自何人。因此，唯独弥赛亚神藉着祂的天使行事，祂看见并知道每一件最小的事，并由此指导人类的努力。这就是“亚伯拉罕不认识我们”的意思。今天，某种事物通过一种抽象思维上升到天使那里，令他们惊讶的是，他们居然被它感动了，于是通过其他人与我交谈。天使并不想知道地上正在发生什么，因为他们知道，一切都已走向败坏和毁灭；所以，他们热切渴望弥赛亚神的国度到来，希望他们与人类之间的交流由此被打开。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 206</h4><p>206. [This second section of experiences extracted from volumes of the Bible Index, containing paragraphs 206 to 972 1/2, was originally written at the end of the Bible Index of the Prophetical Books.]<p>Abraham does not know us, as we read [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Is. 63:16</a>], and the angels do not know us<p>For a long time I believed that the innermost and very inward angels knew what I was doing and thinking, since I thought it was their doing that the evil plans and deceptions of lying spirits were constantly being restrained. But when I was allowed on several occasions, by the Divine Mercy of God the Messiah, to speak with others who were bringing down the thinking of those angels to me, it was told by them that those angels did not know at all what I was doing or seeing, as did the spirits closest by, but that they were nevertheless continually reacting against the endeavors and acts of evil spirits, or of their aura, which they sensed most keenly, but did not know from what cause or from what person [it arose]. So it is only God the Messiah, Who acts through His angels, Who sees and knows every least thing, and Who therefore directs human endeavors. Now this is what is meant by the words, "Abraham does not know us." Today by means of a certain abstract thought, something ascended to the angels which moved them. They were surprised, and then spoke with me through others. 1747, the 13th day of October (old calendar).<p>Nor do the angels want to know what is going on on earth, because they are aware that everything has gone to corruption and ruin; wherefore they desire that the Kingdom of God the Messiah may come, hoping that communication may thus be opened up between them and mankind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 206</h4><p>206. THAT "ABRAHAM DOTH NOT KNOW US", AS WE READ [Is. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">lxiii 16</a>, AND THAT THE ANGELS DO NOT KNOW US <p>For a long time I supposed that the inmost and more interior angels knew what I was doing and thinking, since I was of the opinion that the continual repression of the evil intentions and falsehoods of false spirits came from them. But when, by the Divine Mercy of God Messiah, I have sometimes been allowed to speak with others, who transferred their intellectual ideas to me, they said that they did not at all know or see what I was doing, as did the spirits nearest me, but that they were nevertheless in continual reaction against the endeavors and acts of the evil spirits, that is, of their sphere which they felt most sensitively; but from what cause, or from what man, they did not know. Thus it is God Messiah alone Who acts by means of His angels, Who sees and knows the most single things, and so disposes human endeavors. This is what is meant by the words - "Abraham doth not know us". [Is. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">lxiii 16</a>.] Today, something ascended to the angels by a certain kind of abstract thought, by which, to their surprise, they were moved; and thus they spoke with me through others. 1747, Oct. 13, o.s. Nor do the angels want to know what is taking place on earth, because they are aware that there is nothing but what is perverse and vastated, wherefore they ardently desire the coming of the Kingdom of God Messiah, hoping that thus communication between themselves and men will be opened. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This passage is thus entered in the Index (s.v. Angelus): <p>"The angels of the interior heaven perceived nothing of my sensual things; but still they were in a continual general reaction against each single attempt of the evil spirits; concerning this I was instructed by word of mouth, and also from the fact that the angels were all at once given to perceive something which made them wonder whence it was: also that they do not desire to be in earthly things, because these are too remote from them, being perverted, and particulars." <p>Between n. 206 and n. 207 the following unfinished paragraph was crossed out: "THAT THE INTELLECTUAL IS SEPARATED FROM THE VOLUNTARY. <p>It has also been demonstrated by living experience, not only that the intellectual is separated from the voluntary, but also that evil spirits suppose that they are of a good nature, and sometimes well ..." </p>
