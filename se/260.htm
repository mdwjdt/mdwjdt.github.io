<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第260节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>260.关于被请赴婚筵，没穿礼服，被丢在外边的人（马太福音22:11-14）。今天，一个恶灵向我显现；他以为自己已经上升到更内在的天堂，因为他将自己高高举过头顶，想要兴风作浪，夺走对弥赛亚神的信仰，然后把它转到自己这里，由此甚至想将自己提升到弥赛亚神那里，声称祂的权柄属于他自己；殊不知，他只不过在尚有恶灵居住的末层天堂。这一事实通过代表被指示给他，却是徒劳；因为他仍继续自己的邪恶。不过，这个人因是一个恶灵，故不得不通过代表或想象的表象来对付。因此，真理有代表性地围住他；于是，他被赶走了。他叫喊说，他极其痛苦，乞求从那个地方释放他。这就是那些妄图篡夺掌管别人信仰的权柄，将其归于自己的人所必须遭受的，尤其当这种努力并非出于纯粹的无知之时（1747年11月20日）。他在痛苦中说，他是受魔鬼团伙怂恿这么干的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 260</h4><p>260. About the man not invited to the banquet, and not dressed in a wedding garment, who was cast out [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_11.htm">Matt. 22:11-14</a>]<p>Today a certain evil spirit appeared to me who thought that he had risen up into the very inward heaven, because he had lifted himself very high overhead and wanted to stir up trouble there by diverting belief from God the Messiah and transferring it to himself. Thus he wanted to exalt himself even unto God the Messiah, and claim His power to himself - not knowing that he was only in the last heaven, where evil spirits are still dwelling. This fact was shown to him pictorially, but to no avail; for he went on with his wickedness.<p>But because this person was an evil spirit, he had to be dealt with by means of symbolic displays, or mental imagery. Therefore, truth was wrapped around him symbolically, whereupon he was cast out, and he shouted that he was being greatly afflicted, begging to be released from that place.<p>This is what must be suffered by those who contemplate arrogating to themselves power over the faith [of others] - especially when this effort is the result of more than mere simplicity. 1747, the 20th day of November (old calendar). In his distress he said that he had been instigated to doing this by the diabolical gang. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 260</h4><p>260. CONCERNING ONE WHO WAS NOT INVITED TO THE FEAST, AND NOT BEING CLOTHED WITH FESTIVE GARMENTS, WAS CAST OUT <p>Today there appeared to me a certain evil spirit who supposed he had ascended into the more interior heaven, by having raised himself higher above the head; and there he wanted to excite disturbances by taking away faith in God Messiah, which he wanted to transfer to himself, and so to raise himself even to God Messiah and claim to himself His power, not knowing that he was only in the ultimate heaven where evil spirits as yet dwell. This was shown of him by means of representations, but in vain: he persisted in his malice. But because he was an evil spirit he had to be dealt with by representations, or by imaginary appearances. Wherefore truth was wrapped around him representatively; he was expelled therefrom, and he shouted out that he was being greatly afflicted, begging to be released. In this way ought one to feel concerning those who think they can assume to themselves the power to implant [faith], especially when this does not come from pure ignorance. 1747, Nov. 20, o.s. He said in his affliction that he had been instigated to do this by the diabolical crew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 260 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>260. De non invitato ad convivium, et non induto <sup>1</sup></p><p>vestibus convivii, ejecto [cf. Matth. XXII.. 11-[14]<p>Hodie apparuit mihi quidam malus spiritus, qui putabat se ascendisse in coelum intimius, per id quod altius se efferret super caput, et ibi turbas excitare voluit, derogando Deo Messiae fidem, quam in se transferre vellet, et sic se extollere usque ad Deum Messiam, ac Ipsius potestatem sibi vindicare; non sciens quod esset modo in coelo ultimo, ubi spiritus mali adhuc habitant, quod ei per repraesentationes ostensum est, sed incassum, perrexit in malitia; sed quia spiritus malus esset, cum eo per repraesentationes seu imaginationes agendum erat, quare ei circumdabatur repraesentative veritas, inde ejectus est, et vociferabatur, quod magnopere affligeretur, petens ut inde solveretur; ita sentiendum de iis, qui potestatem in fidem sibi assumere putant, cumprimis quando id a pura ignorantia non venit. 1747, die 20 Nov. st. v. In afflictione sua dicebat quod instigatus ad id faciendum esset a turba diabolica.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
