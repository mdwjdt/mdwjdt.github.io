<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4109</h4><p>4109. About things in the other life<p>It was observed and imparted that whatever a person had done in the life of the body, returns in the other life, for there are perpetual changes of states into which they are introduced, so that there is no state that existed in bodily life that does not return - thus whatever hatreds and like evils they had not only done, but had thought - and indeed, from their early childhood even to the last moment of their life. The very persons against whom they had harbored hatred, whether openly or in secret, at that very moment are present in person, and then they are driven into lamentable states. But I noticed that to those who had been evil, all their evils, done or thought, return in full life - but not so in the case of those who were good and who had faith, but with them rather, all states of goodness, of friendship and of love return, together with the highest delight and happiness. 1748, 1 Dec. Experience that there was a bad custom with me. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4109</h4><p>4109. CONCERNING THINGS IN THE OTHER LIFE.<p>It was observed and insinuated, that whatever a man had done in the life of the body, this returns in the other life, for there are perpetual changes of states, through which spirits are led, so that there is no state which had existed in the life of the body, but it then returns; thus the hatreds and other things, which one had not only done, but thought; nay, everything of the kind which had occurred from infancy to the extreme limit of life. Even the very persons against whom he had cherished enmity, either open or concealed, are instantaneously present, so lamentable are the states into which they are driven. But, what is peculiarly observable, all the evil deeds and thoughts of the evil return to the very life, but with the good and those who were in faith it is not so; all these states of good, of friendship, and of love return with the highest delight and happiness. - 1748, December 1. Experience, in this respect, testifies that evil does not reign with me. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4109 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4109. De iis quae in altera vita<p>Observatum et insinuatum, quod quicquid homo in vita corporis fecerat, hoc redeat in altera vita, sunt enim perpetuae statuum mutationes, in quas introducuntur, sic ut nullus status sit, qui in vota corporis, qui non redeat, ita odia et caetera, quaeque non solum fecit, sed quae cogitavit; et quidem quae ab infantia sua ad ultimum suae vitae, ipsae personae, contra quos odium habuit, sive apertum, sive occultum, etiam tunc momento in personis adsunt, ita tunc in lamentabiles status aguntur: at quod observandum, qui mali fuerunt, quod omnia eorum mala facta et cogitata redeant ad vivum; at qui boni et qui in fide, non ita, sed status omnes boni, amicitiae, et amoris cum summa jucunditate et felicitate. 1748, 1 Dec. Experientia quod malus mos apud me esset. </p>
