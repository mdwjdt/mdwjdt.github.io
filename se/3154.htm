<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3154</h4><p>3154. What the mental images are like, of those who do not believe because they do not understand<p>By means of a spiritual mental image I saw, and was allowed to share with spirits, that the mental images of those who do not want to believe unless they know and understand are formed from innumerable ones of those who reason falsely about every object of sight. For the urge of spirits is such that, thinking they know everything, they reason about everything, some even from conviction, when yet it is a false one. These innumerable images merge in every single one belonging to those who do not want to believe unless they understand, so that if that mental image formed from all those images were presented before the eyes, by portraying a face, or some other thing, they would be so filthy and ugly, that there never could be anything filthier and uglier, 1748, 14 Sept.<p>This I saw by a spiritual mental image, together with the spirits around me. One spirit told that he had seen a mental image displayed to him, of someone, not so evil, saying that he had never seen an uglier one, 1748, 14 Sept., and it was only a general mental image, so faint as to be none at all. Another said only that he had not believed it possible for such things to be seen in the other life-his mental image being at once portrayed, which surpassed the others in ugliness. 1748, 14 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3154</h4><p>3154. THE QUALITY OF THEIR IDEAS, WHO DO NOT BELIEVE, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. <p>I saw by spiritual idea, and it was given to hold communication with spirits [to this effect], that the ideas of those who do not wish to believe, unless they know and understand, are formed from innumerable [ideas] of such as reason falsely concerning every object of sight: for spirits have such a cupidity that they think they know everything, and reason concerning everything: some indeed from persuasion, when yet [it is] a false [persuasion]. Such innumerable ideas concur in each idea of those who do not wish to believe, unless they understand. Wherefore, if that idea [formed] from all these [ideas] were presented before their eyes, by representation of a face, or something else, there would be such base and hideous [faces], that nothing could ever appear more base and hideous. - 1748, September 14. This was seen in spiritual idea, with spirits around me. A certain spirit said that he saw represented the idea of someone, who was not so [very] evil, and that he never saw anything more hideous. - 1748, September 14. And it was only a general idea, as obscure as if it were nothing. Another merely said that he did not believe such things could have been seen in the other life; his idea was immediately represented, and surpassed others in ugliness [turpidine]. - 1748, September 14. </p>
