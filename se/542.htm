<p>542.但他们的天使立刻就会出现，占据其头部的区域；他们用一种特别的方式，而不是这个星球的灵人所用的方式充满这个区域。这个星球的灵人可以说占据脑部和头部，有时以这种力量占据，以至于感觉他们好像一起在挤压头皮，或拔掉头骨，常常伴有某种疼痛的感觉。因此，有人若经历我所经历的，会以为他们正在拔掉他的头骨，甚至把他的脑部压扁。但木星灵以一种柔和的吹动靠近，并以一种柔和、协调的滑行占据脑部，因为他们担心这个人会受到伤害，感受到来自他们的痛苦。他们就通过这种滑行运动进入我里面。他们是那些约束恶灵，免得他们做出超出主许可的坏事的灵人；恶灵以这种方式被保持在界限之内，并受到控制。这些是保护他们的天使。我也和他们交谈过。（1748年1月26日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 542</h4><p>542. But their angels are present instantly, and occupy the region of their head, which they fill up by a special method, not used by the spirits of this earth.<p>The spirits of this earth as it were take possession of the brain and the head, and sometimes with such force that it feels as if they are squeezing together the scalp, or pulling off the skull, very often with some sense of pain; so that if any other than an experienced person were to undergo this, they would believe it was pulling off their skull, or even squashing their brain.<p>But the spirits of the planet Jupiter approach with a gentle blowing action, occupying the brain in a kind of gentle and coordinated glide, for they fear that the person might be hurt and feel pain from them. They came to be within me by this gliding movement. They are the ones who restrain evil spirits from doing something worse to them than they have been permitted by the Lord to do; so that an evil spirit is held within limits, and controlled. These are their angels, who preserve them. I have spoken with them also. 1748, the 26th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 542</h4><p>542. But their angels <sup>1</sup>are instantly present, and occupy the region of their head which they infill in a special manner, not in the way the spirits of this earth do; the spirits of this earth as it were obsess the brain and head, and sometimes with such force that they, as it were, either compress the scalp of the head or draw away the cranium, very often with a certain sensible pain. If anyone else should have experienced what I experienced, he would have supposed that they were drawing away his cranium, or even entirely compressing the brain. But the spirits of the planet Jupiter act with a gentle aspiration which infills the brain as with a gentle and general approach, for they fear lest the man should be injured and feel pain from them; by such an approach they were present with me. These are they who restrain the evil spirits lest they should do anything worse than the permission given them by the Lord; in this way an evil spirit is kept within limits and coerced. These are their angels who preserve them, with whom I also spoke. 1748, Jan. 26. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Index (s.v. Foviales), they are called "Angelic spirits". </p>

Sed angeli eorum illico adsunt, et tenent locum capitis eorum, quod implent speciali modo, quo non spiritus hujus telluris, spiritus hujus telluris quasi obsident cerebrum et caput, et quandoque tali vi, ut quasi vel comprimant calvitium <sup>1</sup></p><p>capitis, vel cranium quasi subtrahant, saepius cum sensibili quodam dolore, [ut] si quis alius quam <sup>2</sup></p><p>expertus id experturus esset, autumaret, quod subtraheret cranium, vel etiam prorsus comprimeret cerebrum; sed spiritus telluris Jovis, leni quadam adspiratione [agunt], quae implet cerebrum, quasi leni et communi allapsu, nam timent, ne laedatur homo, et sentiat ab iis dolorem, hoc allapsu penes me fuere, et ii sunt qui arcent spiritus malos, ne aliquid pejus iis faciant, quam iis datur permissio a Domino <sup>3</sup></p><p>, quare malus spiritus tenetur intra limites, et coercetur, ii sunt eorum angeli, qui conservant eos; cum quibus etiam loquutus sum. 1748, die 26 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript; in J.F.I.
