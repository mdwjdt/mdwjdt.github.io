<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2467</h4><p>2467. Some were indignant that they were therefore nothing and thus unable to lead themselves on their own, a sentiment common to almost all spirits except the best. One was saying he did not want it to be shown so clearly that he was influenced in this way and was therefore nothing, and it is enough that he knows this and can affirm it. But I was prompted to say this is not enough, and he ought to believe it, knowing is not believing, there ought to be conviction regarding the truth, otherwise it is not a faith formed of truth - adding that if he is not convinced and has not true faith, he is in darkness, because in falsity.<p>Yet the opinion was prevalent that this person knew more than others, so in the course of a symbolic display as before [<a href="542.htm">542</a>, <a href="963.htm">963-964</a>], I saw the outward part of his head drawn up toward higher spirits so that they could investigate the nature of the darkness there is in such people who have only a faith of the memory, and are not convinced by an inward faith regarding the truth. Those who were investigating told me that the darkness was great, like a dark mass made up of hairs of various colors. This showed what darkness there is sometimes with those whose faith is only knowledge, and not a true faith. <sup>1</sup>1748, 30 June.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Half-deleted in the original stand the words, "that is, with Conviction."  </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2467</h4><p>2467. Certain were indignant that thus they were nothing, and so could not of themselves lead themselves, which is common [familiare] with nearly all spirits, besides the best. [A certain one] said that he was not willing it should be shown so plainly that he was so led [diceretur for dueretur, I think], and thus was nothing, and that it is enough if he knows this, and can say if it is so; but it was granted me to respond that it is not enough, but it is necessary to believe it: knowing is not believing: there must be persuasion of truth, otherwise there is no faith of truth; adding that if he is not persuaded, or in true faith, that he is in darkness, because in falsity. And yet the opinion concerning him was that he knew more than others; wherefore, according to a representation as before, the exterior part of his head seemed to me to be taken away to higher [superiores] spirits, in order that they might inspect what sort of darkness is in such as possess only a faith of the memory, and are not persuaded by interior faith concerning the truth. Those who inspected related to me that the darkness was great, as it were a something dark [tenebricosum], made up of hairs of various colors. Hence it was manifest what sort of darkness is sometimes with those who have only scientific faith, and not a true [one]. - 1748, June 30. </p>
