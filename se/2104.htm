<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2104</h4><p>2104. That such societies exist is also clear to me from the experience I have had several times of faces being displayed to me that changed within a minute's time into very many faces one after another, all radiating the same kind of affection, but varying continually as to species. This was nothing else than a society acting together, and in succession, one individual in the society after another. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2104</h4><p>2104. That societies are such is also evident from experience sometimes granted me, when faces were represented, which were changed in a moment of time into many other faces in succession, in which a similar genus of affection shone forth, but was varied continually according to species which was nothing else than the acting of one society, and of one in succession after another in the society. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2104 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2104. Quod tales societates sint, constare quoque potest ab experientia, mihi repraesentatarum facierum, aliquoties, quae mutatae sunt intra minutum temporis, in perplures facies successive, in quibus simile genus affectionis elucebat, sed variabatur continue secundum {a} species; quod nihil aliud erat, quam quod societas una ageret, et successive unus in societate post alterum. </p>
