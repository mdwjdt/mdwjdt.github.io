<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4425</h4><p>4425. What it means that one must not judge others; society; inward qualities<p>Very often I have spoken with spirits about what is to be understood by the words that one must not judge others; and it was agreed that everyone may judge another as regards his or her civil life, and moral life insofar as it concerns the civil. For associations must be entered into, and one must know to what extent another is to be trusted, what is fitting, and what is not, so that one may not be deceived. For there are pretenders, deceivers, hypocrites, adulterers, evil people of every kind, there are the wise, there are the foolish, there are those who do not at all value the public welfare, but put themselves in the first place, and others of all kinds. Therefore without reflection, thought and thus judgment on one's own part, no one could survive in civil life. Then especially [one must know] whether a given person would be useful as a public functionary, and so forth, which one is not given to discern without judgment on one's own part regarding another. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4425</h4><p>4425. HOW IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE MUST NOT JUDGE CONCERNING OTHERS; SOCIETY; THE INTERIORS.<p>I have spoken frequently with spirits as to what is meant by the precept that we are not to judge concerning others, and it was agreed that everyone may judge concerning another as to what regards his civil life, and also his moral [life] so far as it concerns the civil. It is proper for one to know what connections may be safely entered into, and how much trust is to be reposed in another; what is suitable to be done, and what not; for there are pretenders, deceivers, hypocrites, adulterers, and evil men of all kinds; there are wise men, and fools, and those who value nothing of the public [good], but prefer themselves, and all varieties of character; consequently, without reflection, thought, and thus judgment with one's self, no one would ever be able to live in civil life. It is especially [necessary to judge] whether this or that man is useful for discharging public offices, and so forth; in which it is not possible to distinguish without judgment with one's self concerning another. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4425 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4425. Quid quod non judicandum de aliis, societas, interiora<p>Saepius cum spiritibus loquutus quid intelligendum per id quod non judicandum de aliis, et consensum, quod unusquisque judicare possit de alio quod spectat vitam ejus civilem, tum moralem quantum concernit civilem, quia societates jungendae, et sciendum quantum alii fidendum, quid convenit ei et non convenit, ne decipiatur, nam sunt simulatores, dolosi, hypocritae, adulteri, sunt omnis generis mali homines, sunt sapientes, sunt stulti, sunt qui nihil publicum aestimant, sed se praeponunt, sunt alii aliter, ita absque reflexione, cogitatione, et sic judicio apud se, nusquam aliquis in vita civili vivere posset, tum imprimis num hic utilis sit fungendis officiis publicis, et sic porro, quae discernere non datur absque judicio apud se de alio. </p>
