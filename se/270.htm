<p>270.死后灵魂所在的气场对应于人体的各个部位和肢体。我从活生生的、感觉极其明显的经历获知，肉身死后人的灵魂居住的所谓气场完全对应于人体的各个部位；即：属天气场对应于人的头，低一点的气场对应于两腰，最低的对应于脚。因此，当在没有天使铜柱包围(228节)的情况下，我再一次被下放到低地时，我蒙允许感知到灵魂所在的低地对应于脚；因此，最低的地方必对应于脚掌，或脚掌之下的区域；只是我没法感知它，因为我没有被下放得那么深。然而，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，我被恩准感觉这些灵魂从低地出来，因而进入最末层天堂。正当他们上升的时候，我与他们在低地交谈；他们也证明他们对于从囚禁和坑里被释放的喜乐。（1747年11月28日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 270</h4><p>270. The environments where souls are after death interact with the parts and members of the human body<p>From actual and quite sensate experience, I have learned that the auras, as they are called [<a href="262.htm">262</a>], where human souls abide after the death of the body, interrelate entirely with the human members; specifically, the heavenly domain with a person's head, but the lower ones with the loins, and the lowest with the feet. For this reason, when I was let down once again into the lower place without the angelic column around me [<a href="228.htm">228</a>], then it was granted me to perceive sensorially that the lower place, where there were souls, corresponded to the feet, so that the lowest place must correspond to the soles of the feet, or to the region under the soles - which, however, I was unable to perceive because I was not let down that deeply.<p>But also by the Mercy of God the Messiah, it was granted me to feel that the souls were emerging from the lower places and thus coming into the last heaven (in the lower place I spoke with them, also when they were rising up), and that they also gave expression to their gladness at being delivered from their bonds, and from the pit. 1747, the 28th day of November. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 270</h4><p>270. THAT THE SPHERES IN WHICH SOULS ARE AFTER DEATH CORRESPOND TO THE PARTS AND MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN BODY <p>From living and very sensible experience I have learnt that the so-called spheres where human souls dwell after the death of the body, correspond entirely to the members of the human body; namely, celestial spheres correspond to the head of man, the lower spheres to the loins, and the lowest to the feet. Therefore, when I was again let down into the lower place without the angelic column around me [see n. <a href="../se/228.htm">228</a>, it was then granted me to perceive sensibly that the lower place where the souls were corresponded to the feet; thus the lowest place must correspond to the soles of the feet, or to the region beneath the soles of the feet, although I could not perceive this, because I was not let down so deeply. Yet by the mercy of God Messiah, it was granted me to feel that they were emerging from the lower places, and thus coming into the ultimate heaven. I spoke with them in the lower place, also at the time that they were rising; and they also testified their gladness that they were released from their bonds and from the pit. 1747, Nov. 28. </p>
