<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2281</h4><p>2281. There were spirits who also possessed my body and afterwards spoke with me, saying that they were entirely unaware that they were not a body, that is, life in a body. Still, they did express other thoughts, saying they knew they were spirits, and so on, but this they had found out from me, because they so possessed what was mine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2281</h4><p>2281. Spirits who possessed the body afterwards also spoke with me, saying that they did not at all know other than that they were the body as well as the life in the body. They said still further [loquebantur usque alia] that they knew themselves to be spirits, and many things [besides], but this [they learned] from me; because they thus possessed what was mine [mea]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2281 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2281. Spiritus quoque qui possidebant corpus, postea quoque mecum loquuti sunt, dicentes, quod prorsus non aliter noverint, quam quod ii corpus essent, h.e. vita in corpore; loquebantur usque alia, quod scirent se spiritus esse, et plura, sed hoc [sciverunt] a me, quia mea possidebant ita. </p>
