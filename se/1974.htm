<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1974</h4><p>1974. As for the meaning of "evening and morning," in all phases of regeneration, both general and particular, the progression starts from evening, and tends toward morning. In general, the evening of those who are being regenerated is misery, temptations, despair, but they arrive at the morning. So also in detail, in all phases of regeneration one begins from evils, which are turned into good. And it is worth remembering that evil spirits begin, out of their own fantasies and passions, to arouse the person, but that these evils are turned into good in various ways. This has been revealed to me by experience lasting 3 years. So that is "evening and morning," and it applies to every least phase. Therefore it is the process not only of regeneration, but also of the perception of goodness. 1748, 16 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1974</h4><p>1974. As to evening and morning, [it is to be known] that in all things pertaining to generation both in general and in particular the commencement is from the evening, and the progress onward to morning, as in general with those who are regenerated their evening is [a state of] misery, temptations, and despairs, from which, however, the coming forth is to the morning. The case is similar in particular instances, for in all things of regeneration the start is from evils which are turned into goods; and it is remarkable that evil spirits begin from their phantasies and cupidities to excite men, though these influences are in various modes turned into goods, as has been made known to me by a daily experience of three years' continuance. This is evening and morning even in most singular things, whence not only is regeneration, but the perception of goodness. - 1748, May 16. </p>
