<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4022</h4><p>4022. He was told that heaven consists of love, and that from love they have from the Lord all the higher knowledge of faith that meets their needs at a given time, [and] now, that those who have faith without love thus without good works have no higher knowledge, and do not even know what the inner person is, as I realized in his case, that he did not. It is confirmed in the case of one who has spurious or false love, which convinces him of and confirms him in, the many false notions that flow from spurious love, or lust. He was also told that those are by far better off who do good works from a conscience they have accepted because the Lord has commanded that we give to the poor and do good. For those acting in accordance with a conscience from that source, who do not place merit in their works, are introduced into heaven; but those who confirm themselves in the belief that faith without good works is saving, cannot be introduced into heaven, for they do not know what love is, which yet is the all in all things of faith. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4022</h4><p>4022. It was said to him that heaven consists of love, and that it thence derives from the Lord all the knowledges of faith that are necessary to it, and in which knowledges the celestials are. On the other hand, they who are only in faith without love, and thus without good works, are in no knowledge at all; they do not even know that there is an internal man, as I perceived in regard to this spirit that he was ignorant of it. The same remark may be confirmed from one who is in false and spurious love, that he is thereby persuaded and thus confirmed in many falses which flow from this spurious love or cupidity. It was further said to him that they are much better who do good works from a conscience received from this - that the Lord has commanded that we give to the poor and do good; for those who act from a conscience thus formed, do not place merit in their works, and thus such are admitted to heaven, while those who confirm themselves in the belief that faith without good works is saving, they cannot be admitted into heaven, for they know not what love is, which is yet the all in all of faith. - 1748, November 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4022 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4022. Dictum ei, quod coelum consistat ex amore, et inde habent a Domino omnes cognitiones fidei, sibi necessarias, in quibus tunc sunt, nunc, qui solum in fide absque amore sic absque bonis operibus, in nulla cognitione sunt, et ne quidem sciunt, quid internus homo, quod percepi ab illo, quod nesciret: potest confirmari ex eo, qui in spurio et falso amore est, quod ex eo persuadeatur, et sic confirmetur multis falsis, quae fluunt ex amore spurio seu cupiditate. Dictum ei porro, quod meliores sint multo ii, qui faciunt bona opera, ex conscientia, quam acceperunt ex eo, quod Dominus ita mandavit, quod dandum pauperibus, et bonum faciendum, nam ii qui ex conscientia inde orta, non meritum ponunt in operibus, ii intromittuntur in coelum, at qui se confirmant quod fides absque bonis operibus salvet, ii non intromitti possunt in coelum, nam nesciunt quid amor, qui tamen est omne in omnibus fidei. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
