<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5536</h4><p>5536. I heard such [pseudo-Christians] saying that they had believed they were going to come into heaven since they had lived morally and civilly in outward respects and had known the doctrine of the Church, that is, had listened to sermons, but that they had now become aware that the civil life is something other than the spiritual life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5536</h4><p>5536. I heard such ones saying that they believed, since they have lived morally and civilly in externals, and have known the doctrine of the church, or listened to preachings, that they were going to come into heaven; but that they now see that civil life is a very different thing to spiritual life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5536 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5536. Audivi tales dicentes, quod crediderint se in coelum venturos, quoniam in externis moraliter et civiliter vixerint, et sciverunt doctrinam Ecclesiae seu audiverunt praedicationes, sed quod nunc animadvertant civilem vitam aliud esse quam spiritualis vita. </p>
