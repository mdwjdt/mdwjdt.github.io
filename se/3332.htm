<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3332</h4><p>3332. A spirit was shown that he could not speak of anything but whatever<p>object might be presented to him through my thought<p>A certain evil spirit, speaking quite readily without holding back, said he was speaking from himself, so I just fixed my gaze on a fly; then he could not speak of anything but the fly as I watched it. I could not observe any thought content associated with my gaze. This taught me that he was not speaking from himself-so [much so], that he was soon unable to stop talking. 1748, 25 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3332</h4><p>3332. IT WAS SHOWN A SPIRIT THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK OTHERWISE THAN ACCORDING TO THE OBJECT PRESENTED TO HIM THROUGH MY THOUGHT.<p>A certain evil spirit, speaking quite readily without resistance [hindrance] [remisu], said that he spoke from himself. Wherefore I merely fixed my look [intuitum] on a fly. He then could not speak other than concerning the fly, according to my looking [intuitionis]. The cogitative [principle] of the looking [intuitionis] could not be observed by me. Hence I was instructed that he did not speak from himself: so [that] he must have immediately retained from speaking, [without an object afforded by me]. - 1748, September 25. </p>
