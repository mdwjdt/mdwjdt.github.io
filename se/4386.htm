<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4386</h4><p>4386. About Freedom<p>That in the other life everything appears free and spontaneous, is clear in many ways, even for the evil in doing, thinking and speaking evil, if it is from the way they lived. Therefore they are left to their own life, and held in a life of passions and fantasies, in which they are much confirmed, for otherwise they cannot become better. In freedom those qualities are implanted that belong to the other life, never under compulsion. Outer restraints are acquired that finally seem free. 1749, 11 Sept. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the moon, meaning Monday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4386</h4><p>4386. CONCERNING LIBERTY.<p>That in the other life everything appears free and spontaneous, is evident from many considerations, especially from the case of the evil, that they are in the freedom of doing, thinking, and speaking evil, if it be from their life. In this way they may be left to their own life and held in the life of lusts and phantasies, in which they are much confirmed, as otherwise they cannot become better, for the things which pertain to the other life are implanted in a free principle, never in compulsion; external bonds are acquired, but at length they seem no impediment to freedom. - 1749, September 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4386 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4386. De Libertate<p>Quod in altera vita omne liberum appareat, et ex semet, quod multis constat, etiam malis, malum agendi, cogitandi, loquendi, si ex vita eorum, sic quod relinquantur suae vitae et teneantur in vita cupiditatum et phantasiarum, et multum confirmentur in iis, quia aliter non possunt meliores fieri, in libero implantantur illa quae alterius vitae sunt, nusquam in coacto, vincula externa acquiruntur, tandem ut libera videantur. 1749, 11 Sept. </p>
