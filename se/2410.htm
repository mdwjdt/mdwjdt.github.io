<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2410</h4><p>2410. The advantage or more perfect ability of angels over spirits, thus to a greater degree over people on earth<p>Some of the more outstanding abilities may be seen discussed earlier [<a href="2394.htm">2394-2397</a>], but this is also evident from the fact that when I was reading the Hebrew language, I remembered more or less reading words, and still recalled them to a degree, sometimes very slightly. When the Lord pleases, the angels are able to tell how many times I had read those words, what I had in mind at the time that was more strongly or more weakly impressed on my memory, and other details that were joined to the word in my mental imagery. They could tell that these things were in my memory, and more besides that I do not know. 1748, 27 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2410</h4><p>2410. THE PREROGATIVE OR FACULTY OF THE ANGELS IS MORE PERFECT THAN THAT OF SPIRITS [proe spiritu], THEREFORE IS IN A SUPERIOR DEGREE TO THAT OF MAN [proe homine]. <p>It may be seen above, concerning certain more eminent faculties [of angels]. (This) may also be evident from this: that when I read the Hebrew tongue, I recollected words that I had read with more or less attention [magis minusque], and still recollected them in some degree, [though] at times very slightly. When it pleases the Lord, then can the angels know how many times those words were read by me, what was then in my mind what was more deeply or lightly impressed on the memory, and many things which were then in my ideas, along with the word. That such [a word was] in my memory, besides many things which I do not know. - 1748, June 27. </p>
