<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4014</h4><p>4014. But as to how the gestures of other people stream in through the eyes of someone, by which he judges concerning a person, and how the facial expression, as well especially as the speech of one flows into the mental imagery of the other, it is very evident that this takes place by removals of lower things, as if by their dying off, so as to become nothing - otherwise one does not see. Words, or material things, whence the nearest mental imagery comes, are rejected or removed at once, then this imagery is rejected, whence inward mental imagery comes, regarding man's purpose, and many other matters thus flowing from the other's speech. Without these removals, no such thing can be seen, but with them, the inward mental imagery of others is communicated and appears clearly as if naked, without extraneous coverings. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4014</h4><p>4014. But how the gestures of one may flow in through the eyes of others, from which they judge of a man's character; how the countenance of another makes him known; and especially how the speech of one flows into the ideas of another, -all this, it is clear, is affected by the removals or abstractions of lower things, or by their extinction, so that they may become nothing, as otherwise the perception does not take place. The sounds or material accompaniments whence flow the proximate ideas, are forthwith rejected or removed, then these ideas are rejected, whence arise the interior ideas respecting a man's end, and in many other things which thus flow from the speech of another. Without these removals, nothing of the kind can be perceived; but let them be made, and then the interior idea of another is communicated, and is set forth nakedly manifest and separate from all extraneous appendages. - 1748. November 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4014 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4014. Quomodo autem gestus aliorum influunt per oculos alius, ex quibus judicat de homine, tum quomodo vultus alius; ut etiam praecipue, quomodo loquela alius influit in ideas alterius, hoc constat clare, quod fiat per remotiones inferiorum, sicut per mortificationem eorum, ut nihil sint, alioquin non percipit, rejiciuntur seu removentur illico voces, seu materialia, inde ideae proximae, tunc hae ideae rejiciuntur, inde ideae interiores, de hominis fine, tum de multis aliis, quae fluunt ita ex loquela alius; absque remotione eorum nihil potest percipi tale, sic idea interior aliorum communicatur, et sistitur manifesta sicut nuda, absque iis quae extra sunt. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
