<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2582</h4><p>2582. There is a great multitude of spirits who take pleasure in bringing harm on others<p>One cannot marvel enough at how great a multitude there are of those in the world of spirits, both in its lower and in its inward part, who take almost their only delight in being able to torment whomsoever they meet, and the more harm they bring on them, the greater is their delight. This is clear to me from manifold and almost daily experience. The reason is that people in the life of the body are of that nature that they find pleasure in being able to bring harm on others, both physical and financial - indeed, even as to their soul, as is evident to anyone who pays attention.<p>Since punishment is inherent in sins [see <a href="2438.htm">2438</a>], it can also be clear what kind of punishment awaits them, for before they can be in good societies, those qualities must be removed by means of torments. If people are like this in the interiors of their character, then it is evident how much torment, and how much time it will take, until they finally return to their right mind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2582</h4><p>2582. THAT THERE IS A GREAT MULTITUDE OF SPIRITS WHO DELIGHT IN INFLICTING HARM ON OTHERS. <p>No one can help wondering at there being a very great multitude in the world of spirits, as well in its inferior as in its interior [sphere], of those whose only delight almost is that they may be able to torment whomsoever they meet with. This has become apparent to me from manifold and almost daily experience. [It arises] from the cause that men in the life of the body are such as to delight in being able to inflict harm upon others as to their body and property [opes], yea, also as to their soul, as may be manifest to anyone who attends [thereto]. Since punishment is in sins, it is hence also apparent what sort of punishment awaits them; for before they can be in good societies, such things must be removed by torment. If man is such as to the interiors of his nature, then how much torment [must he endure], and how much [long a] time must elapse until he returns to reason [ut tandem mentis suae compos fiat]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2582 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2582. Quod spirituum multitudo magna sint, qui oblectantur in eo, ut damnum aliis inferant<p>Non satis mirari quis possit, quam magna multitudo eorum sint <sup>1</sup></p><p>in mundo spirituum, tam in inferiori ejus quam in interiori ejus, qui unicum fere oblectamentum in eo habent, ut quemcunque offendunt <sup>2</sup></p><p>, possint cruciare, et quo majus damnum eis inferunt, eo majus oblectamentum capiunt, quod ex multiplici et fere quotidiana experientia mihi constitit; ex causa, quod homines in vita corporis tales sint, ut delectentur iis, si possint aliis damnum quoad corpus et quoad opes inferre, imo quoque quoad animam, sicut cuivis constare potest, qui attendat. Cum poena inest peccatis [vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2582/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2438" target=_top>2438</a>], inde quoque constare potest, quale eos manet supplicium, nam antequam possint interesse societatibus bonis, talia per cruciatus auferendd, [et] si homo talis sit quoad interiora ejus naturae, tunc quantus cruciatus, et quantum temporis futurum, ut tandem mentis suae <sup>3</sup></p><p>compos fiat.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic manuscript<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has offundunt<p>3.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
