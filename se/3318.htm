<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3318</h4><p>3318. I was also instructed that heavenly and spiritual angels each induce a different breathing, indeed, the heavenly one kind, with every possible difference, and the spiritual another, with every difference, as was shown to me by means of the breathing itself. Moreover, a spirit of Mercury enumerated many kinds of breathing, some of them communicated to me, both those that flowed into the inward breathing, and those that flowed in outwardly especially toward the left eye. Therefore each society of the grand human being has its own kind of respiration, which all flow in and determine the ordinary respiration of mankind. And because the kinds are innumerable, and the species of each kind innumerable, I cannot yet show what they are like, except as said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3318</h4><p>3318. I was then also instructed, that the celestial and spiritual angels induce various kinds of respiration, yea, celestial [angels] one kind, with every difference, and the spiritual [angels] another kind, with every difference, as was shown me by means of the respiration itself. Besides which, the spirits of Mercury enumerated many kinds of respiration, part of which were communicated to me; as well as such as inflowed into interior respiration, as those which externally towards the left eye; so that every society of the Grand Man has its own sort of respiration, which inflow and constitute the general [respiration] of man; and as the genera are innumerable, and the species of each genus are innumerable, I am not yet able to represent their nature specifically; as has been said. </p>
