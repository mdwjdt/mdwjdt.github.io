<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2356</h4><p>2356. About the Literal meaning of the Word<p>While I was reading in the Word of the Lord, certain spirits were concerned about the words and expressions. I was prompted to tell them that the names there, of cities, regions, people, cannot possibly pass over into heaven to the angels, because they are limited, physical, material; so they do not know what those names are. Nor can the rest of the expressions, nor can the literal meaning, that of the letter, because it also is physical, worldly and material, but the inward and more inward meaning can. The meaning of the letter only comes to the nearest spirits. Consequently, if it does not pass into heaven to the angels, there must be no life in [that] meaning of the Lord's Word.<p>That the angels do not understand the meaning of the letter of the Word is also evident from the fact that their speech is ineffable, because pertaining to inward, and more inward matters, thus to the essence of reality, which is life. 1748, 18 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2356</h4><p>2356. CONCERNING THE LITERAL SENSE OF THE WORD. <p>Whenever I read in the Word of the Lord, certain spirits were solicitous about the words [verbis], or words [vocibus]; to whom it was given to say that the names there, as those of cities, countries, men, can never pass into heaven to the angels, because they are finite corporeal, and material, so that they are ignorant what these names mean neither can the other words [voces reliquioe] [reach them], nor can the literal sense or that of the letter, because it also is corporeal, mundane, and material, but that the interior and more interior sense may. The sense of the letter only comes to the nearest spirits, therefore, if [no sense of the Word] comes into heaven to the angels there cannot be any life in the sense of the Word of the Lord. That angels do not understand the sense of the letter of the Word may hence also be manifest, in that their speech is ineffable because of such things as belong to interior and more interior things, hence to the essence of things which is life. - 1748, June 18. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2356 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2356. De sensu Literali Verbi<p>Cum legerem in Verbo Domini, quidam spiritus de verbis seu vocibus solliciti erant, quibus dabatur dicere, quod nomina ibi, ut urbium, regionum, hominum, nusquam transire possunt in coelum ad angelos, quia ea sunt finita, corporea, materialia, sic ut nesciant quid nomina ista sint, nec possunt in coelum ad angelos, quia ea sunt finita, corporea, materialia, sic ut nesciant quid nomina ista sint, nec possunt voces reliquae; nec potest sensus literalis seu literae, quia is quoque corporeus, mundanus et materialis, sed sensus interior ac intimior; sensus literae solum ad proximos spiritus venit, proinde si non in coelum ad angelos, non potest esse aliqua vita in sensu Verbi Domini: quod angeli non intelligant sensum literae Verbi, exinde quoque constare potest, quod loquela eorum est ineffabilis, quia talium quae sunt interiorum ac intimiorum, proinde essentiae rerum, quae est vita. 1748, 18 Junius. </p>
