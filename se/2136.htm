<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2136</h4><p>2136. It was asked how it is with Peter, to whom were given the keys of the kingdom of the heavens [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_19.htm">Matt. 16:19</a>]. It was answered, that by Peter is meant belief, and that the keys to the kingdom of the Lord are given to faith, because no one can be admitted into heaven except by means of faith in the Lord, and no one but the Lord gives belief. Therefore the Lord Alone has the keys of the heavens, and he gives heaven to whomsoever it pleases Him. Thus it is not [in the hands] of any man.<p>Faith is meant by Peter, just as by the other apostles are meant religious qualities: as, for example, by James, charity, and by John, the fruits of charity, in which all the elements of Christian religion are embodied. For this reason, he was leaning on the Lord's bosom [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_23.htm">John 13:23</a>]. 1748, 31 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2136</h4><p>2136. Inquiry was made how it was with Peter, to whom were given the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. The answer was, that by Peter is understood faith, and to faith are given the keys of the Lord's kingdom, because no one can be admitted into heaven save through faith in the Lord, and no one grants faith but the Lord, wherefore the Lord alone has the keys of the heavens, and gives heaven to whomsoever it is His good pleasure; so that it is not of any man. Faith is understood by Peter, like as by the other apostles, the things which are of faith; as, for instance, by James charity, and by John the fruits of charity: and because therein are all the things of faith, he was on the bosom of the Lord. - 1748, May 31. </p>

XVI: 19</a>], respondebatur, quod per Petrum intelligatur fides, et fidei datae sunt claves regni Domini, quia nullus nisi per fidem in Dominum admitti potest in coelum, et nullus dat fidem nisi Dominus, quare Solus Dominus habet claves coelorum, et dat coelum cuicunque beneplacet: sic non est ullius hominis. Fides per Petrum intelligitur, sicut per caeteros apostolos, illa quae sunt fidei; ut per Jacobum charitas, et per Johannem fructus charitatis, in quibus quia omnia fidei sunt, ad pectus Domini fuit. 1748, 31 Maj.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
