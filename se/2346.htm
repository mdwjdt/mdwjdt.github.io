<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2346</h4><p>2346. About the meaning of the rainbow after the flood [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_13.htm">Gen. 9:13-16</a>]<p>I spoke with angels about the state of some after death who were the kind not to let in any goodness, but the moment they are on the verge of even the slightest bit of goodness, they at once carry it into evil. These are the worst, who have entirely profaned what is holy and who are nothing but forms of hatred joined with deceit. In the other life they cannot be corrected, or their earthly character bent to goodness, but are completely purged until nothing of them remains. So they are no longer possessed of a life of their own, but of a different one, even though what is theirs remains, but this is not allowed to appear. As soon as it appears and they thus recognize their own character so they possess a little of their own life, they cannot be in the company of heavenly beings. So they are of the kind that is totally purged, as I have heard about the people before the flood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2346</h4><p>2346. CONCERNING THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE RAINBOW AFTER THE FLOOD. <p>I spoke with angels concerning the state of certain surging-ones after death, who are of such a character as to be incapable of admitting anything good; but as soon as anything, even the least of their [good principle], is present, it is forthwith carried away into evil. Such are those who are the worst sort, who wholly desecrate sacred things, and are nothing but hatreds and cunning [treachery]. In the other life these cannot be reformed, nor their natural disposition bent to good, but are wholly vastated, till nothing of them remains, so that they no longer possess their life, but become different [others], although what is theirs remains, but this is not allowed to appear; for as soon as it appears, and they thus recognize what is theirs so that they can be the least particle possessed of their own life, they cannot be in the society of the celestials, wherefore they are such as are wholly vastated, as I have heard of the antediluvians. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2346 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2346. De significatione Iridis post diluvium [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2346/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_19_13-16" target=_top>Gen. IX: 13-16</a>]<p>Cum angelis loquutus sum de statu quorundam post mortem, qui tales sunt, ut nihil boni admittere possint, sed ut primum aliquid vel minimum, ab eorum, adest, illico in malum fertur, tales sunt qui pessimi sunt, qui prophanarunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>prorsus sancta, et qui non nisi odia cum dolis sunt: ii in altera vita non possunt emendari, seu eorum naturalis indoles flecti in bonum, sed prorsus devastantur, usque dum nihil eorum remanet, sic ut non sint suae vitae amplius, sed alii {a}, tametsi quod eorum est, manet, sed hoc non conceditur ut appareat, nam illico ut apparet, et sic quod eorum est cognoscant, ut sint aliquantulum ex sua vita, non possunt esse in societate coelestium, quare sunt tales, qui prorsus devastantur, sicut audivi de antediluvianis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has propharunt </p>
