<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3016</h4><p>3016. A symbolic portrayal was also displayed to me in sleep. I seemed to be lifted up to the ceiling and stick there by the head and then rest calmly, afterwards to be let down, and halfway to be moved around safely, by which I was moved around in respect to the table below, where some woman was sitting and eating from a dish. Again I was moved around, and it was turned into a different dish on which food was made just like that, which was being eaten.<p>I was thinking that they understood by this that they had obtained a miraculous food, but when that dish was being taken away, which was done by a different woman, serving, they did not realize that it was a new dish and that the food had been formed there miraculously, which much surprised me, and when I tasted what it was when she was carrying it off, it was peas (or gron art <sup>1</sup>with fish).<p>This shows what a symbolic portrayal of them is like, but what this vision in sleep means, I do not yet know. I perceive that it regards the Quakers, namely, that they do not know that anything can be imparted miraculously by the Lord, and that it can still be given to them even though they are unaware, namely, goodness of life and (oprigtighet <sup>2</sup>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "green peas."<br><br>2.&nbsp;Swedish for "uprightness." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3016</h4><p>3016. There was also exhibited a representative to me, in sleep. I seemed to be elevated to the ceiling [tectum], and to stick there by the head, and so to rest tranquilly; afterwards, to be let down, and, in midway, to be securely led around [circumduci]. From this circumduction [I was] let down on the table beneath, where a certain woman sat and ate from a dish. The circumduction took place and was afterwards changed into the dish, wherein was food thus made, which was eaten. I supposed that they thus understood that they have acquired a miraculous food; but when that dish was carried away, which was [done] by another woman, serving, they did not perceive that [it was] a new dish, and that the food was miraculously formed there; whereat I greatly wondered, and when I tasted what it was, when [she] carried it away from thence, there were [it was] peas [pisa]; [seu gron art cum pisce]; hence may be apparent what is the nature of their representative; but what is signified by the vision of sleep, I do not yet know. I perceive that it respects Quakers, to wit, that they do not know [that], anything is ever miraculously insinuated by the Lord; and although they do not perceive it, yet it is given to them, to wit, probity of life, and [oprigtighet]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3016 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3016. Repraesentativum etiam mihi exhibitum erat in somno, videbar elevari ad tectum, et ibi capite adhaerere, et sic quiescere tranquille, postea demitti, et in media via circumduci secure, ex qua circumductione, in mensa subter, ubi quaedam mulier adsidebat et edebat ex una patina, facta est circumductio, et versa postea in [aliam] <sup>1</sup></p><p>patinam, in qua erat cibus sic factus, ex quo comedebatur, ego putans quod sic intelligerent quod cibum adepti sint miraculosum, sed cum patina ista auferebatur, quod erat a faemina ministra alia, non perceperunt quod nova patina, et ibi cibus miraculose formatus, quod multum miratus, cumque gustabam quid esset, cum inde deportaret, erant pisa <sup>2</sup></p><p>(seu gron art cum pisce); inde <sup>3</sup></p><p>constare potest, quale est repraesentativum eorum, sed quid significat somni visio nondum scio. Quakeros spectari percipio; nempe quod non sciant, aliquid miraculose usque insinuari a Domino, et illud quamvis non percipiunt, usque iis dari, nempe probitas vitae et (oprigtighet).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;cf. indicem ad Edere, Idea, Piscis, et Quaqueriani<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
