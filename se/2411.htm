<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2411</h4><p>2411. A striking feature of someone who had worshipped a carved image in bodily life<p>When I read <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_17_1.htm">Judges 17</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_18_1.htm">18</a>, there was a certain spirit from among those who had worshipped carved images in their lives, from India. And since spirits are such that they can be brought to believe they are others, he therefore thought that he was Micah, from whom the Danites had taken away his carved image, and teraphim, and Levite, in the whole chain of events of chapter 18.<p>As I was reading I realized that this spirit indeed thought himself to be Micah, and that he was grieving with a kind of innocent pain, and hardly knew any more what he was upon losing the carved image and teraphim. I sensed the innocence in every detail, how he longed to have it back from those who were taking it away, and that they had behaved wickedly against him. In short, there was ignorance of the true God together with innocence in every detail. There were also many from among Christians present and watching this, and they were surprised, because he was a worshipper of a graven image.<p>Later it was disclosed that he was from India and in bodily life had worshipped some graven image out of ignorance, in his innocence. That innocence was very touching to some. Afterwards they spoke with him, saying that he could not adore the carved image alone, but because [God] is a human, he had nevertheless, albeit unknowingly </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2411</h4><p>2411. A CERTAIN REMARKABLE THING ABOUT ONE WHO ADORED A GRAVEN IMAGE DURING THE LIFE OF THE BODY. <p>When I read Judges 17 and 18, there was a certain spirit from India of those who adored graven images in their lifetime; and inasmuch as spirits are such that they can be induced to believe that they are (such and such), he supposed therefore that he was Micah, from whom the sons of Dan took away his graven image, and teraphim and Levite, in all the series [described in] chap. 18. When I was reading, I perceived that a certain one supposed himself to be Micah, and that he grieved with a certain innocent grief so that he scarce knew any longer what he was, when he lost the graven image and teraphim. I perceived innocence in each thing; how he longed to possess it from those who carried it away, and that these acted illy against him. In a word, [this] was ignorance of the true God, since there was innocence in each thing. There were also many Christians [who] observed it, and wondered at it, inasmuch as he was a worshipper of graven images. It was afterwards discovered that he was from India, and in his lifetime worshipped a certain graven image in ignorance, in his innocence, which innocence considerably affected some. Afterwards they spoke with him, saying that he could not worship merely a graven image, but still because he was a man (his ignorance was allowed). </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2411 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2411. Insigne quoddam de quodam qui sculptile in vita corporis adoravit<p>Cum legi Judic. XVII et XVIII erat quidam spiritus ex iis qui adorarunt in vita sua sculptilia, ex India, et is putabat, quia tales sunt spiritus, quod induci queant credere, quod ii sint, sic quod is esset Micha, a quo Danis filii abstulerunt ejus sculptile, et teraphim, et Levitam, in tota serie C {a}. XVIII, cum legerem, percipiebam, quod is quidem se putaret esse Micham, et quod doleret dolore quodam innocente, sic quod vix sciret amplius, quid esset, cum amitteret sculptile et theraphim; innocentiam percepi in singulis, quomodo avebat id ab iis qui auferebant, habere, et quod ii male contra eum egerint; verbo, ignorantia veri Dei, cum innocentia erat in singulis, plures ex Christianis erant quoque, et id observabant, et mirati, quia sculptilis adorator; postea detectum, quod is esset ex India, et in <sup>1</sup></p><p>vita corporis sui adoraverit sculptile quoddam ex ignorantia, in innocentia sua, quae innocentia multum movit quosdam; postea cum eo loquuti, dicentes, quod non sculptile solum potuit adorare, sed quia hic homo, usque, licet in ignorantia sua,<p>(2412.) cogitaverat de Deo, extra sculptile, qui creator coeli terraeque esset, et quod esset Dominus, Qui regeret universum coelum et terram, tunc percipiebam ejus adorationis effectum interiorem, multo sanctiorem, quam usquam apud quendam Christianum, et quidem interiorem; ex quo exemplo constare potest, quod gentiles <sup>2</sup></p><p>multo facilius in coelum veniant, quam Christiani, et quod simile fiat, ac olim cum Judaeis, a quibus ad gentes fides venit. 1748, 27 Junius.<p>Nec is opus habuit instrui sicut alii, de doctrinalibus fidei, sed quia fidem recipit facilius quam alii, omnia potest discere a Domino, et quidem ita, ut sicut angelus instruere possit scitissimos Christianos in fidei doctrina, sicut mihi quoque insinuatum est ab angelis. 1748, 27 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has in in<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
