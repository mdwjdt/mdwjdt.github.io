<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2119</h4><p>2119. Little children can be playing, and fearing nothing at all,<p>when yet malicious spirits are present,<p>trying to bring harm on them<p>Today, like several times previously, I experienced being allowed in a group of little children who were playing innocently, for there is innocence in whatever they do. Then wicked spirits round about, angered and enraged, railed and cursed at them, trying to bring harm on them.<p>But the little children were not at all afraid, sometimes completely unaware of their being present and cursing them in this way; and if they had known, they still would have been shielded by their innocence.<p>So this is in line with the passage, lions and bears [will lie down] with sheep, and the suckling will play in the serpent's hole [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>]. 1748, 29 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2119</h4><p>2119. THAT INFANTS CAN PLAY AND NEVER FEAR ANYTHING, ALTHOUGH WICKED SPIRITS ARE PRESENT AND ENDEAVOR TO BRING EVIL UPON THEM. <p>I have experienced today, and several times previously when it was granted to be in society with infants, who played innocently, for whatever they do innocence is therein, that then the wicked spirits around were enraged and smitten with anger, and calumniated them, speaking ill, therefore attempting to bring evil unto them; but infants do not fear anything at all whenever wholly ignorant that such were present, and thus aspersed them, and if they had known would still be protected by their innocence thus does it come to pass [coincidit] that lions and bears shall lie down with sheep, and the suckling play with the serpent in his den. - 1748, May 29. [See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>.] </p>

Quod infantes ludere possint, nihil usquam timere, tametsi maligni spiritus adsint, et conentur inferre malum<p>Expertus hodie, et aliquoties prius, cum dabatur esse in societate cum infantibus, qui luderent innocenter, nam quicquid usque agunt, innocentia inest, tunc maligni spiritus circum irati et perciti ira, calumniati sunt, maledicentes, sic conantes inferre malum, sed infantes <sup>1</sup></p><p>ne hilum timebant, quandoque prorsus nesciebant, quod adessent, et quod ita maledicerent, sique novissent, usque per innocentiam tegerentur, ita coincidit, quod leones et ursi cum ovibus, et lactans in antro ludat cum serpente [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_11_6-8" target=_top>Jes.
