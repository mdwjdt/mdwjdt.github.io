<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5188</h4><p>5188. But it should be known that people who have had wisdom in the world have wisdom in the other life, which becomes their own; and those who have not had wisdom in the world but goodness in their life are able to receive wisdom through the former, although it does not become their own. When they withdraw from those whose wisdom is their own, they are of a simple nature as they were before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5188</h4><p>5188. It should be known, that he who has been in wisdom in the world, is in wisdom in the other life - which is appropriated by him; and they who have not been in wisdom in the world, but yet in the good of life, are able to receive wisdom through the former; but, still, it is not appropriated by them. When they recede from those by whom wisdom is appropriated, they are simple, as before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5188 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5188. Sciendum est, quod qui in sapientia fuit in mundo, ille in sapientia sit in altera vita, quae appropriata ei, et qui non in sapientia fuerunt in mundo, sed in bono vitae, illi recipere possunt sapientiam per illos, sed usque ea non eis appropriatur; cum recedunt ab illis, quibus appropriata est sapientia, simplices sunt ut prius. </p>
