<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4378</h4><p>4378. Persons are recalled, together with a mental image, if anyone had instructed them about evils<p>It has happened several times that things have been called forth out of my memory by spirits, and then at the same time the persons to whom they were uttered and by whom they were heard, and that those same persons were also made to be present. From this it can be realized how dangerous it is to instruct others regarding evils, or to confront anyone with offences. In the night, 1749, 28 Aug. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the moon, meaning Monday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4378</h4><p>4378. THAT PARTICULAR PERSONS MAY BE RECALLED WITH, AT THE SAME TIME, AN IDEA OF THE FACT IF INSTRUCTION IN EVIL HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED.<p>It has sometimes happened that certain things spoken have been called forth from my memory by spirits, and at the same time the idea of the persons to whom they were uttered, and by whom they were heard, and then those very persons were made to be actually present; from whence it may be known how dangerous it is to instruct others in evil, or to put offences in the way of anyone. - 1749, August 28. </p>

Quod personae revocentur cum idea, si quinam de malis instruxerunt<p>Aliquoties factum quod e memoria mea evocatum a spiritibus, et tunc simul personae, ad quas dicta sunt, et a quibus audita, et personae eaedem etiam praesentes factae, inde sciri potest, quam periculosum sit alios instruere de malis, seu scandala alicui facere.
