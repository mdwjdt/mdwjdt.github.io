<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 178</h4><p>178. About the food and drink of spirits <sup>1</sup><p>Everyone can understand that spirits and angels do not indulge in earthly food and drink; nevertheless, they do want and crave to be reinvigorated. But their food and drink is spiritual, that is, they are always eager to know whatever is happening, and are almost never satisfied. The heavenly angels' food is love, and at the same time understanding of truth and goodness, which they enjoy exceedingly.<p>The food of spirits, who are to be called feelings [<a href="156.htm">156</a>], are many types of feelings, all according to their character; and their eagerness to know things is their drink. <sup>2</sup>For there is nothing they are not eager to know, whether it is their business or not. It is for this reason also, that in the Word of God the Messiah, wisdom is called heavenly food, and understanding, drink.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Numbers 171-177 do not occur in the manuscript.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Meaning no doubt their thirst. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 178</h4><p>178. <sup>1</sup>CONCERNING THE FOOD AND DRINK OF SPIRITS <p>Everyone can know that spirits and angels do not enjoy natural food and drink, though they still long and desire to be refreshed; their food and drink, however, are spiritual, namely, that they continually desire to know whatever occurs, and are scarcely ever satisfied. The food of celestial angels is love, and at the same time, the intelligence of truth and good, by which especially they are gladdened. The food of spirits who are to be called affections are the many affections in agreement with their nature, and the cupidities of knowing are their drink; for there is nothing that they do not long to know, whether it concerns them or not. For this reason, also, in the Word of God Messiah, wisdom is called heavenly food, and intelligence heavenly drink. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Numbers 171-177 do not occur in the manuscript. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 178 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>178. <sup>1</sup></p><p>De cibo et potu spirituum<p>Cuivis notum esse potest, quod spiritus et angeli non fruantur cibo aut potu naturali, usque tamen cupiunt et desiderant refici; sed cibus et potus eorum est spiritualis, nempe quod jugiter desiderent scire quicquid obvenit, et fere nusquam contenti sunt; angelorum coelestium cibus est amor, et simul intelligentia veri et boni, qua maxime laetantur; cibus spirituum, qui affectiones dicendi, sunt plures affectiones secundum indolem eorum, et potus eorum, sunt cupiditates sciendi, nam nihil non est, quod non scire cupiunt, sive ad rem eorum faciat, sive non: quapropter etiam in Verbo Dei Messiae sapientia dicitur cibus coelestis, et intelligentia potus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;171 ad 177 desunt </p>
