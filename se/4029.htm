<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4029</h4><p>4029. I noticed that whenever the angelic choirs were approaching, it occurred that just that often those who were there were expelled, and, in fact, toward me, and toward the lower regions. For those who had made these holes for themselves wanted to find out which angelic societies were with me while I was sleeping, which they claimed they were able to see, as well as where they came from. For example, there then appeared something most beautifully variegated, like tapestries beautifully and richly embroidered, with such colors as purple, but in faint background - thus a broad rainbow-colored form in a faint background. From this they said they were able to know that they were angels from the province of the eye - whether of the iris, or of the retina, I do not know. But because they were the kind who steal in among those who constitute the chamber of the inner nostrils, with the purpose of ensnaring me while I slept, they were cast down. Thus as often as the angelic choirs approached, I noticed that they were cast down, which happened several times, so their number was great. I then also spoke with them, and those female spirits are now with me, some toward the inward parts of the palate, some toward the stomach, some toward the buttocks. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4029</h4><p>4029. It was observed that whenever the angelic choirs approached, which happened from time to time, so often those who were there were driven away, and that too towards me and towards a lower quarter, for the spirits who had framed such openings for themselves wished to know what kind of angelic societies were with me while I was asleep, which they said they could see, as also whence they were; as there would then appear a most beautiful variegated something, like elegantly wrought carpets of broad dimensions, and adorned with purple and similar colors, but in a somewhat obscure plane, thus a broad rainbow-colored form in an obscure ground; from this they said they could know that angels were present from the province of the eye, but whether of the iris or the retina, I do not know.<p>But inasmuch as these were such as insinuated themselves among those who constituted the cavity of the internal nostrils, with the design of plotting against me while asleep, they were cast down; and this I observed occurred as often as the angelic choirs drew nigh, which was rather frequently, so that their numbers must have been large. I afterwards spoke with them, and they are now with me, some towards the interior of the palate, some towards the ventricle, and some towards the nates. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4029 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4029. Observatum quod cum angelici chori venirent, quod aliquoties factum, quod toties expellerentur ii qui ibi, et quidem versus me, et versus inferiora, nam quae foramina talia sibi fecerunt, scire voluerunt, quaenam societates angelicae apud me cum dormirem, quod etiam iis videri posse ajebant, tum undenam essent, sicut quod tunc appareret pulcherrimum diversicoloratum, sicut tapetes pulcherrime picti, et hoc late, cum coloribus purpureis et similibus, sed in obscuriori plano, ita forma lata iridea in plano obscuriori, ex eo dicebant se potuisse scire quod angeli qui sunt e provincia oculi, sive iridis, sive retinae ibi, non scio; sed quia tales erant, qui se insinuarant apud eos qui constituunt narium internarum cameram, fine insidiandi mihi cum dormirem, dejecti sunt: sic quoties angelici chori veniebant, percepi quod dejicerentur, et hoc aliquoties, sic ut magna eorum copia esset, cum quibus dein quoque loquutus, et nunc apud me sunt, quaedam versus interiora palati, quaedam versus ventriculum, quaedam versus nates. </p>
