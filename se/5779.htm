<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5779</h4><p>5779. THE LOCATION OF THOSE WHO ARE IN THE LOWER EARTH<p>HEAVEN<p>Location there in respect to the form [of heaven] cannot be comprehended. In heaven itself, which is in the high realms, it is entirely heavenlyضery perfect in the inmost heaven, and perfect also in the rest. But all the angelic societies there are arranged according to the form of heaven, and although they appear separated, nevertheless they are arranged according to a form. But this form cannot be grasped by anyone there. What the nature of this form is can to some extent be grasped from the form of the fibers in the human body where there are such forms surpassing comprehension, as in the brain where all things are arranged in series and bundles, and although these forms appear like a gummy something in a snowy-white tangle, yet they all flow in this order and extend themselves into the nerves, and so not the least thing is lacking but every [component] of the will flows separately into the actions in the body. This can be seen in the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata, and the spinal marrow, in which the cortical substances are, from which the fibers flow out, for the beginnings of everything in the body are there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5779</h4><p>5779. THE SITUATION OF THOSE WHO ARE IN THE LOWER EARTH AND IN THE HEAVENS. <p>Situation there, as regards the form, is incomprehensible. In heaven itself, which is in the lofty parts, the form is entirely heavenly; most perfect in the inmost heaven, and perfect, likewise, in the rest; but all the angelic societies there are arranged according to the form of heaven, and although they appear separate, yet nevertheless they are arranged according to the form; but no one there is able to compass that form. Of what nature it is may be somewhat comprehended from the form of the fibers in the human body, where such forms exist as surpass all understanding: as, for example, in the brain, where all things are arranged in series and bunches, and although those appear like a glutinous something and a snowy mass, still all things flow according to order, and put themselves forth into the nerves in such a manner that not the least thing is lacking, in order that everything of the will may flow distinctly into acts in the body. This may be seen in the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata and the spinal marrow, in which organs are the cortical substances from which the fibers flow forth for therein are the beginnings of all things in the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5779 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5779. DE SITU EORUM QUI IN TERRA INFERIORI COELUM<p>Situs ibi quoad formam est incomprehensibilis; in ipso coelo, quod in altis, est forma prorsus coelestis, perfectissima in intimo coelo, et quoque perfecta in reliquis, sed secundum formam coeli dispositae sunt omnes societates angelicae ibi, et tametsi apparent separatae, usque tamen secundum formam dispositae sunt; sed illam formam non quisquam ibi comprehendere potest; qualis illa sit aliquantum comprehendi potest ex forma fibrarum in corpore humano, ubi dantur tales formae, quae excedunt omnem captum, ut in cerebro, ubi omnia disposita sunt in series et fasciculos, et tametsi apparent illae sicut glutinosum quid et nivea congeries, usque fluunt omnia eo ordine, et se exserunt in nervos, ut non minimum desit quin omne voluntatis fluat distincte in actus in corpore. Hoc videri potest in cerebro, cerebello, medulla oblongata et medulla spinali, in quibus substantiae corticales sunt ex quibus fibrae profluunt, nam ibi sunt principia omnium in corpore. </p>
