It was said about him that he had persecuted Jesus when He was in the world, and it was he who had tempted Him the most, and had also stirred up the priests and elders through dreams, both knowingly, as at that time, and unknowingly, for he was the chief of those who are in hell and love themselves. 1748, the 21st day of January. </p>

Dicebatur de eo, quod persecutus sit Jesum cum in mundo esset, et is maxime Ipsum tentaverit, tum per somnia excitaverit sacerdotes et praesbyteros, tam quod id sciverit, sicut eo tempore, quam quod ignoraverit, nam fuit caput eorum qui in inferno sunt, et semet amant. 1748, d. 21 Jan. </p>
