<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5577</h4><p>5577. Few of the English are demons because in an issue at hand they depend on the authority of others apart from their own thinking, and because also they are easily influenced by the reasoning of others and the arguments understood and consequently accepted if they simply believe that a man is learned and honest and one of their countrymen. <sup>1</sup>Their thought appears to be enlightened and inward. However, many of the Dutch become demons because they think against others on the basis of their own [interest] and do not make it known. Their thought in the spiritual world appears dimmer and lower.</p><p>[2] Also, many of the English in the other life receive the heavenly doctrine and as a consequence come into the New Jerusalem, because they are such that they receive faith's truths when they see them, and they see in a certain inward light and so remain in it. The English do this quickly, but the Dutch slowly, for those who long for heaven see and grasp the means slowly, and when they have grasped that a life according to the precepts of this doctrine leads to heaven, finally they acknowledge it. They walk in accordance with the form of heaven and what they then know further. They act in accordance with inward symbolism. Their thoughts are in accord with the form of heaven, and, what is unknown to man؛they are] reasonings which are truth's truly analytical arguments stemming from good.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;At this point in the margin are the words "The English, the Dutch." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5577</h4><p>5577. Few of the English become genii, because they rely on the authority of others, with self-thought at the time, and on the reasonings and reasons of others, according to their apprehension and consequent reception thereof. Hence, also, they are yielding. If only they believe that a man is learned and sincere, and of their own nation, then, their thought is clear and interior. Many of the Dutch, however, become genii, because they from their own [thought] think contrary to others, and do not disclose the fact. Their thought, in the spiritual world, appears lower and more obscure. Many of the English also embraced the heavenly doctrine in the other life, and thence came into the New Jerusalem, because they are such that they embrace the truths of faith when they see them; and they see [them] in a certain interior light, and so remain in it [i.e. the heavenly doctrine]. This the English do quickly, but the Dutch slowly; for they who covet heaven see slowly and take up immediate [truths]; and when they grasp the fact that a life according to the precepts of that doctrine leads to heaven, they at length acknowledge them. They walk according to the form of heaven; and what they then know that is higher, this also they practice, according to interior representatives. Thoughts are according to the form of heaven; and - what man is unaware of - rational [ideas] which are truly analytical, are of truth from good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5577 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5577. Pauci ex Anglis sunt genii, quia ab aliorum auctoritate absque propria cogitatione tunc dependent, et quia ex ratiociniis aliorum et rationibus secundum captum et inde receptionem, inde quoque faciles sunt, modo credant quod vir doctus et sincerus sit, <sup>1</sup></p><p>et ex sua natione, cogitatio eorum apparet lucida et interior, at ex Hollandis <sup>2</sup></p><p>multi fiunt genii, quia cogitant contra alios ex suo, et non id vulgant, cogitatio eorum in spirituali mundo apparet obscurior et inferior. Multi etiam ex Anglis in altera vita receperunt doctrinam coelestem, et inde in Novam Hierosolymam venerunt, quia tales sunt ut recipiant vera fidei, quum vident illa, et vident in luce quadam interiore, et sic manent in illa: hoc cito faciunt Angli, sed Hollandi lente, nam qui cupiunt coelum, lente vident et capiunt media, et cum capiunt quod vita secundum praecepta illius doctrinae ducat ad coelum, tandem illa agnoscunt; ambulant secundum formam coeli, et quid tunc sciunt ulterius, etiam secundum repraesentativa interiora agunt; cogitationes sunt secundum formam coeli, et quod nescit homo, rationalia quae vere analytica veri ex bono.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;Sidebar: Angli,<p>2.&nbsp;Sidebar: Hollandi </p><p> </p>
