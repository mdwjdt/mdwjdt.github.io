<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 179</h4><p>179. About the End of the World<p>So easy it is for Jehovah God to destroy the whole human race, and everything living on earth - and indeed, instantly, and by fire or hellish pains! For there are evil spirits who very closely surround the nature-bound person, and arouse his or her life; and as soon as they are given the power to act, the person is instantly tormented by a kind of spiritual fire, and dies, perishing in a moment, when God the Messiah does not, out of mercy, firmly hold all things, down to the very least, in order.<p>This is so true, and I can affirm it so certainly, that I am permitted to swear to it most emphatically. For I have observed it very frequently, and indeed, through experience so real that there can never be any, not even the least doubt. This is the "Terror," and also the "fire," by which the world is to perish [cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_14.htm">Isaiah 33:14-18</a>], <sup>1</sup>if it does not repent, and also [the meaning of the words] "that the seas will roar," "the Sun and Moon will lose their light," etc. 1747, the 27th day of August (old calendar).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See also <a href="189.htm">189</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 179</h4><p>179. CONCERNING THE END OF THE WORLD <p>How easy it would be for Jehovah God to destroy the whole human race and every living thing on the earth, even in a moment, and this by means of fire or infernal sufferings! For there are evil spirits who most nearly surround the natural man and excite his life, and as soon as they are given the power of acting, man is immediately tormented by a kind of spiritual fire, and he dies. He would also perish in a moment did not God Messiah from mercy hold each and all things together in order. This I can confirm as being so true and so certain that it is allowable most emphatically to attest it, for I have observed it so very often, and indeed by such living experience, that not even the least doubt is possible. This is the "terror" and the "fire" by which the world is to be destroyed unless it repent. This also is what is meant by the "sea being tumultuous" and the "sun and moon losing their light", etc. 1747, Aug. 27, o.s. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph is thus entered in the Index (s.v. Cruciare): <p>"All would perish with interior torment from evil spirits, unless the Lord governed the universe, and such might be the end of the world if men do not repent." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 179 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>179. De Fine Mundi<p>Tam facile est Jehovae Deo perdere universum genus humanum, et omne vivum in terra, et quidem momento, et quidem per ignem seu infernales dolores sunt enim mali spiritus, qui proxime ambiunt hominem naturalem, et vitam ejus excitant, quibus utprimum datur potentia agendi, illico cruciatur homo, igne quodam spirituali, et moritur, momento etiam perit, quum Deus Messias ex misericordia non continet omnia et singula in ordine; quae tam vera esse, tam certo confirmare possum, ut maxime id contestari liceat, nam id quam saepissime observavi, et quidem per tam vivam experientiam, ut nusquam aliquid, ne quidem minimum dubium, dari queat, hic est "Terror," tum "ignis," quo periturus est orbis [cf <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_179/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_33_14-18" target=_top>Esai. 33:14-18</a>] <sup>1</sup></p><p>, si non resipiscat, tum quoque quod "tumultuatura maria," "Sol et Luna amittent sua lumina" etc. 1747, d. 27 Aug. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;vide etiam <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_179/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_189" target=_top>189</a> </p>
