<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1164</h4><p>1164. A person could never make good and salutary plans unless he believes that the Lord provides for all and the very least details<p>By quite a lot of experience I have been taught that a person can start and make many plans believing them to be good and salutary, when yet they are not. He can even lead spirits and angels to feeling the same way, for they look only at the good intention, going along with whatever supports it. So good spirits and even angels can be led to believe that the plan is good and salutary, when yet it is not. I have been taught this by much experience, when good spirits and even angels are persuaded to agree, even to the point of changing their minds in view of the circumstances (as, for instance, in the matter of how many copies to print). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1164</h4><p>1164. THAT MAN CAN NEVER ACCEPT GOOD AND SALUTARY COUNSELS UNLESS HE BELIEVES THAT THE LORD PROVIDES FOR ALL THINGS AND EACH SINGLE THING <p>By quite manifold experience I have been taught that a man can enter into and accept many counsels which he supposes to be good and salutary; indeed, he can then also induce spirits, even angels, to hold the same opinion, for they only regard the good intention and seek after those things which affirm; thus good spirits and even angels can be induced to believe that that is good and salutary which nevertheless is not so. I have learnt this by repeated experience, namely, that good spirits and even angels may thus be persuaded to affirm, and even to change their sentiments according to circumstances. (As, for instance, in cases which concern the number of copies to be printed.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1164 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1164. Quod homo nusquam consilia bona et salutaria capere possit, nisi credat, quod Dominus provideat omnibus et singulis<p>Per satis multiplicem experientiam doctus sum, quod homo multa consilia inire et capere possit, quae is autumet esse bona et salutaria, imo etiam tunc adducere potest spiritus imo angelos, ad simile sentiendum, nam solum spectant bonam intentionem, et sequuntur ea, quae affirmant, ita induci possunt boni spiritus imo angeli ad credendum, quod id bonum et salutare sit, cum tamen non ita sit; haec edoctus sum per multiplicem experientiam, quod sic boni spiritus imo angeli addaffirmandum persuadeantur, imo ad sententias suas mutandas, secundum circumstantias, (sicut in iis quae concernunt impressionis quantitatem). </p>
