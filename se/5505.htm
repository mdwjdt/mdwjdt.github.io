<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5505</h4><p>5505. Those from the middle who had concepts of what is true and good from the Word were sent there to all. They had been preserved there for a long time as a seedbed, from various levels there. On this account many places there in the middle were purified from evils ones, specifically, they were those whose involvement in what is good and true was pretense, and in spite of this had taken themselves there. The middle region was purified from spirits like this in various ways. [It was like this] for a long time earlier as well, for they were mixed in [like] dregs with those who had concepts of what is [true] and good, so that they might give instruction to the simple-minded from the Catholic populace. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5505</h4><p>5505. Those from the middle, who were in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, were sent thither to all these - who were preserved there for a long time, as in a school - from different altitudes there. Wherefore, the places there, in the middle, were many times cleansed from the evil - those, namely, who were [only] in the pretence of good and truth, and yet have betaken themselves thither. Of such ones the middle region was, also, formerly purged in various ways, through a long time; for only those who were in knowledges, and the good who instructed the simple-minded of the Catholic communion, were intermingled with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5505 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5505. Missi sunt illuc ad omnes ex medio qui in cognitionibus veri et boni ex Verbo, ibi conservati longo tempore ut seminarium, ex variis altitudinibus ibi: quapropter repurgata sunt loca ibi in medio pluries a malis, qui nempe in simulatione boni et veri essent, et usque illuc se contulerunt, a talibus repurgata est regio media variis modis, etiam prius per multum temporis, nam [ut] faex immixti illis qui in cognitionibus [veri] et boni, qui instruerent simplices ex Catholica gente. </p>
