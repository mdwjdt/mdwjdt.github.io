<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2415</h4><p>2415. An inner sensation of spirits and angels coming from a general state<p>There was a general joyful state that was being shared around and so reached spirits and angels. The general joyfulness was touching every individual present, each according to their own condition and character. It was also touching their thoughts with an inner sensation of joyfulness that they acknowledged to be coming from that source.<p>This resulted in a conversation about the inflow of goodness and truth, and of the general states of goodness and truth, into every single aspect of a human being. The same thing is observed in human society: if friendship, love of the married partner, love of children, reigns in common in any society, then every single thing they think, speak and do is joyful.<p>But among people on earth this happens without the clearly felt inner sensation that spirits and angels have. They experience an inner sensation and a vivid feeling, and they have this together with an awareness or higher knowledge of its source. From this they also know that all goodness and feeling for truth in their countless aspects, come only from the Lord. 1748, 27 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2415</h4><p>2415. THE PERCEPTION OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS, [DERIVED] FROM THE GENERAL [communi] STATE. <p>There was a general [communis] state of pleasantness which was given in the general sphere [in commune], and so reached spirits and angels. The general state of pleasantness affected each of those who were there, everyone according to his state and disposition, and also affected their ideas, even to the perception of the pleasantness; which [perception] therefore, they acknowledged to come. Hence [there was] discourse concerning the influx of the good and true, and of their general states into the single things of man; that a like thing is noticed in human society, as that if friendship, love of wife, love of children, prevails generally [communiter] in any society, then the single things which they think, speak, and do, are pleasant. But amongst men such is the case, without the manifest or sensible perception thereof, which occurs with spirits and angels, amongst whom there is perception and living affection, and, indeed, accompanied with reflection, or the knowledge whence [it comes]. Hence they know also that every good and affection of the true, with their indefinite varieties, come only from the Lord. - 1748, June 27. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2415 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2415. Perceptio spirituum, et angelorum, a communi statu<p>Erat communis status jucunditatis, qui in commune dabatur, et sic ad spiritus et ad angelos perveniebat, communis status jucunditatis afficiebat singulos, qui ibi erant, quemque secundum suum statum et indolem, et quoque afficiebat eorum ideas, usque ad perceptionem jucunditatis, quam inde venire confitebantur, inde sermo, de influxu boni et veri, eorumque statuum communium in singula hominis, quod simile animadvertatur in societate humana, ut si amicitia, amor conjugis, amor liberorum, regnat communiter in aliqua societate, quod tunc jucunda sint singula, quae cogitant, loquuntur et agunt; sed inter homines est tale absque perceptione manifesta seu sensibili, sicut apud spiritus et angelos, apud quos perceptio est, et affectio viva, et quidem cum reflexione seu cognitione unde; inde quoque sciunt, quod omne bonum, et veri affectio, cum indefinitis suis varietatibus solum a Domino veniunt. 1748, 27 Junius. </p>
