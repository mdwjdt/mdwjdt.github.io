<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2711</h4><p>2711. About a Kitchen<p>After I had gone to bed, suddenly a door to some kitchen was opened to me, and when the door was opening, I felt the heat of the kitchen strike my face and saw some people running around and hard at work, as well as pots and pans around the walls, then a large fireplace, but these things I saw faintly. Hence it was obvious that this was a kitchen area and the people there were called cooks.<p>When I inquired who in the other life are such as these, I was instructed that they are those who had delighted in the filthiest lust of raping infants and small girls (it is not permitted to tell these things publicly, lest they enter into people's thought)-several times little children were also shown, some of whom had been little children of a 1/2 year, 1 year, 3, 5, 6 years old. Those people are in such a kitchen, and they cook each other in boiling hot water, in which they are tormented most dreadfully. 1748, 31 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2711</h4><p>2711. CONCERNING A KITCHEN. <p>When I went to bed, suddenly to me there was opened a door to a sort of kitchen; and when the door was opened, I felt the heat of a kitchen strike my face, and saw some running about there, and hard at work; besides culinary vessels around the walls, also a great fire-place; but these things [were seen] obscurely, hence I could notice that it was a kitchen [culinary] place, and they who were there were called cooks. When it was inquired what manner of persons were such in the other life, I was instructed that these are they, who are delighted with [that] foulest lust, of defiling infants and very little girls. (These things it is not thus proper to speak in public, lest they come into man's thought.) Sometimes, also, were shown there, who have been infants, some 1/2, 1, 3, 5, 6 years old. These are in such a kitchen, and one cooks another in boiling water, and are therein tormented in the direst manner. - 1748, July 31. </p>

De Culina<p>Cum in lectum ivi, subito mihi aperiebatur janua ad culinam quandam, et cum aperiretur janua calor culinarius ad sensum feriebat faciem, et vidi aliquos ibi discurrentes et sedulos in opere, praeter vasa culinaria circum parietes, tum magnum focum, sed haec obscure; inde animadvertere potui quod esset locus culinarius, et vocabantur coqui, qui ibi ssent. Cum inquireretur, quinam in altera vita tales sunt, instructus sum, quod ii sint qui delectati sunt turpissima cupidine, infantes, et puellas parvas stuprandi, (haec non ita licet in publico dicere ne in cogitationem hominis veniant), ostensi <sup>1</sup></p><p>quoque sunt aliquoties infantes, qui infantes fuere, aliqui 1/2, 1, 3, 5, 6 annorum, ii in tali culina sunt, et unus alium coquit in aqua calida fervente, et inibi cruciantur dirissime. 1748, 31 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has veniant) ostensi </p>
