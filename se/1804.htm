<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1804</h4><p>1804. The third kind are they who bring the greatest harm upon mankind, namely, those who relate to the stagnant fluids within the [cerebral] ventricle. These are of three types, the first, as I was shown, being in the highest place. These speak as gently as if they were inward spirits, so that they are easily able to fool the unwary, as they indeed did deceive some. Their speaking is rapid and soft, and also inward, for they think more than they speak, and when they are deceiving good spirits, they work through their thoughts.<p>In life, these had been people who did not strive openly to control others, because it would have been impossible for them to become princes or kings, or lords, but who had devised to be such confidants and intimates of kings, princes and lords, that these would feel obliged to do nothing except with their advice and judgment. In the company of others they of course boast about this, but when they see that they may be deprived of that power, they speak with restraint, ascribing everything to their prince. They cast on them all blame for wrongs, or else condone them, but claim the credit for any good that is done. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1804</h4><p>1804. The third class are those who cause the greatest injuries to man, namely, those represented by the stagnant humours within the ventricle, which are of a threefold kind, in regard to one of which it was shown me that they occupy a very high position, and speak as gently as if they were interior spirits, so that they can very easily deceive the unwary, as they actually did deceive those [interior ones]. Their speech is voluble and soft, and at the same time interior, for they think more than they speak; and while they deceive good spirits, they act by means of their thoughts. They were, in their lifetime, those who did not openly strive to rule, because that was for them impossible, namely, to be made princes or kings, or lords, but yet they plotted to render themselves so intimate with, and so necessary to, kings, princes, and lords, that they should do nothing without their counsel and dictation. Indeed, they boast themselves of this in the presence of others, but when they perceive that they are liable to be deprived of that power, they speak modestly, attributing everything to their prince. The blame, however, of misfortunes they cast upon this class of dignities, or they excuse them, while they claim for themselves the credit of whatever good is done. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1804 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1804. Tertium genus, sunt ii, qui maxima damna inferunt homini, nempe qui referunt humores stagnatos intra ventriculum, qui sunt triplicis generis, de uno genere, id mihi ostensum est, quod in altissimo loco sint, loquantur tam molliter, ac si forent spiritus interiores, sic ut decipere ignarum facile possint, sicut etiam deceperunt eos <sup>1</sup></p><p>; volubilis et mollis est eorum sermo, et simul interior, nam plus cogitant, quam loquuntur, dumque spiritus bonos decipiunt, per cogitationes agunt, ii fuerunt in vita, qui aperte regnare non studuerunt, quia id iis impossibile, nempe ut principes aut reges fiant, seu domini, sed usque ita a secretis <sup>2</sup></p><p>et necessariis regum, principum et dominorum ambiverant esse, ut illi nihil agere nisi ab eorum consilio et quasi arbitrio, deberent, coram aliis quidem id jactant, sed quum sic percipiunt quod forte privarentur ea potestate, modeste loquuntur, ac principi suo tribuunt omnia, inque eos {a} omnem culpam malorum rejiciunt, vel excusant, sibi autem vindicant quicquid boni fit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has eos,<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has seccretis </p>
