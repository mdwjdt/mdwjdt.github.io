<p>246.关于一些犹太人向弥赛亚神乞求怜悯。当解释以西结书16章，就是论述雅各后代的教会淫乱的地方时，在场的一些犹太人说，他们属于法利赛教门；他们对这些话的内义留意了一段时间后，被真理如此深深地打动，以致他们虔诚地乞求弥赛亚神的怜悯，承认自己的罪恶。（1747年11月13日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 246</h4><p>246. About a supplication by certain of the Jews for the mercy of God the Messiah<p>When the sixteenth chapter of Ezekiel was being explained, where the whoredom of the Church of Jacob's descendants is treated of, some of the Jews who said they had been from the sect of the Pharisees, when they had given their attention for some time to the inward meaning of the words, were so moved by truth that they devoutly implored the mercy of God the Messiah, confessing their sins. 1747, the 13th day of November (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 246</h4><p>246. CONCERNING THE SUPPLICATION OF CERTAIN OF THE JEWS FOR THE MERCY OF GOD MESSIAH <p>When the 16th Chapter of Ezekiel <sup>1</sup>was being explained, where the whoredom of the church of Jacob's descendants is treated of, there were present certain of the Jews who said that they had been of the sect of the Pharisees. When they had attended for some time to the interior sense of the words, they were so deeply moved by their truth, that, confessing their iniquities they devoutly supplicated the mercy of God Messiah. 1747, Nov. 13, o.s. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No exposition of the book of Ezekiel by Swedenborg is known to exist, except that contained in the Summary Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms which was not written until several years later. It is probable, however, that the explanation of the chapter referred to was written in the margin of the Schmidius Biblia Sacra. Unfortunately, the pages containing the sixteenth chapter have been removed from Swedenborg's copy, but as most of the remaining pages are very fully annotated, it seems likely that the missing pages were also annotated. That this chapter had been carefully studied by Swedenborg is evident from the exposition to be found in the Index Biblicus. </p>
