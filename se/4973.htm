<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4973</h4><p>4973. The whole mountain was surrounded with benches in a three, or five, row arrangement, one above, three at mid-level and one below, and all were filled with spirits, a great number. They had their eyes looking all around and they controlled everything. My eye was led around the mountain, and everywhere it was like this; and it was shown that the regions as far as the eye could reach were under their control, everywhere all around. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4973</h4><p>4973. The whole mountain was surrounded with benches, in triple, or fivefold order; [one row] was above, three in the middle altitudes, and [one] below, and they were all filled with spirits in great numbers, who had eyes all round about, and ruled all things. My eye was directed round the mountain and wherever there was such a thing; and it was shown that the tracts, as far as the eye could reach, were under the domination of these, everywhere around. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4973 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4973. Mons totus circumdatus est scamnis triplici ordine, vel quintuplici, supra, 3 in mediis altitudinibus, et infra, et omnia erant impleta spiritibus, multa copia, qui oculos haberent circumcirca et regerent omnia, ducebatur oculus meus circum montem, et ubivis tale erat, et ostensum quod tractus, quousque oculus pertingere potuit, essent sub dominatione eorum, ubivis circumcirca. </p>
