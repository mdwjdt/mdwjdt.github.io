<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1559</h4><p>1559. It is incredible how much can be embraced in a spiritual mental image<p>A spiritual mental image is one that a person thinks when living as a spirit and thus acting as if separately from the body. These are, as already mentioned [<a href="1498.htm">1498</a>], richer mental images, more perceptible of the matters [being thought about].<p>This can be made clear, for example, from the fact that in a spiritual mental image, one can vividly realize and understand how it is that we cannot ever think or do anything at all on our own power, that is not a sin. Even when we intend goodness on our own, thus our own conversion, and repentance, from self, it is still sin, and in fact, not only in general, but in every least detail.<p>All this can be presented in a spiritual mental image, and actually shown; and it has been shown to me at times when I have considered, I should think in this way, because it is not allowed to think in that. Thus I was thinking what I considered the good thing, in fact, the best thing. Nevertheless, I realized that it was sin, because it was from myself. For example, even when I was trying to turn myself to the Lord, and thus attach something good to myself, such as the goodness of belief, the goodness of obedience, the goodness of doing what is commanded in the Word, I still understood that it was sin, down to the least, even the very least details. So there is nothing in man but what is filthy and contaminated.<p>Being thus upset, even to a point of indignation, that I had therefore been unable to do anything whatever of good, the spirits also were upset even to a point of indignation, saying that now they do not know what good they can do - because it is commanded to do good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1559</h4><p>1559. THAT MORE THINGS MAY BE COMPREHENDED IN A SPIRITUAL IDEA THAN IT IS POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE. <p>A spiritual idea is that by which a man, while he lives as a spirit, and thus separated, as it were, from the body, acts and thinks. That ideas of this kind are, as was said before, more full and more perceptive of things, is evident from the fact, that by means of a spiritual idea it can be known and perceived to the life how the case is in regard to man's non-ability to think, much more to act of himself anything that should not be sin, even while he intends good, as, for instance, his own conversion and self-moved repentance, - how all this may be done, and yet there may be sin, not only in the general act, but in the minutest particulars, - all this, I say, may be set forth and shown most vividly to a spiritual idea. This has been shown to me at different times when I have supposed that I thought in this way and not in that, because the one way was lawful, right, and best, and the other not. Thus I supposed, but still I perceived that it was sin, because it was from myself. Thus, for instance, when I would convert myself to the Lord, and thus apply to myself any species of good, as the good of faith, the good of obedience, the good of what is commended in the Word, yet I still perceived that there was sin in the singular and most singular items of the act, so that [it was clear that] there is nothing in man but what is vile and polluted. Being inwardly moved, even to a degree of indignation, at not being able to do anything of good, the spirits also were in like manner indignantly affected, saying that thus they did not know what good they could do, however much it might be commanded. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1559 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1559. Quod plura sint, quae idea spirituali comprehendi queant, quam quae credi possint<p>Idea spiritualis est ea, qua homo, dum quasi spiritus vivit, et sic quasi separatus a corpore agit, cogitat, [ideae spirituales] sunt, ut dictum [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1559/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1498" target=_top>1498</a>] ideae pleniores perceptibiliores rerum, ut ab hoc quoque exemplo constare potest, quod idea spirituali vivum possit sciri percipi, quomodo se habet, quod homo ex se nihil usquam cogitare, minus agere possit, quod non sit peccatum, imo dum ex se bonum intendit, sic sui conversionem, ac poenitentiam ex semet, quod usque sit peccatum quidem non solum in communi, sed in singularissimis, tale sisti potest ideam spiritualem ostendi vivum; quod mihi ostensum est quandoque putavi, quod sic {a} cogitarem, quia non licuit sic {b}-ita <sup>1</sup></p><p>bonum, imo optimum, sic putatum-sed <sup>2</sup></p><p>usque percepi quod esset peccatum, quia a me; ut cum quoque me convertere vellem ad Dominum, et sic applicare mihi aliquid bonum, sicut bonum fidei, bonum obedientiae, bonum mandati in Verbo, usque tamen percepi quod peccatum esse <sup>3</sup></p><p>, in singulis imo singularissimis, sic ut in homine nihil sit nisi spurcum, et pollutum; sic exercitus, usque ad indignationem, quod sic nihil usquam boni agere potuissem, similiter spiritus quoque ita sunt exerciti, usque ad indignationem, dicentes, quod sic nesciant, quid boni agere possint, quia sic jussum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has sic, ita<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has putatum, sed<p>3.&nbsp;sic manuscript; vide praefationem hujus editionis sub capite "Idiosyncrasies" </p>
