<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 644</h4><p>644. They admit that they cannot do otherwise<p>The same ones who were continually plotting deceptions, and were so intent upon them that they hardly paused, were warned by the others to stop. But they admitted that they could not, even if it meant they should die. Others, too, on several occasions have admitted the same thing, that is, that they could not possibly stop. And each time they were told that this is no excuse - for if it were, all devils would exculpate themselves - but that they should go away, or else be driven away, until by fitting types of punishment they begin to feel disgust at doing such things.<p>So by different methods of punishment, they must be divested of evils, as usually takes place. Hence one may infer that it is their natural instinct, acquired in bodily life, not only to feel the greatest pleasure in such evils, but also to be possessed of such a desire for them, that they cannot desist from them, just as wild animals cannot refrain from tearing apart [their prey]. 1748, 5 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 644</h4><p>644. THAT THEY CONFESSED THAT THEY CANNOT DO OTHERWISE <p>These same spirits who were continually fabricating deceits, and inhered so closely in them that they could scarcely leave off, were admonished by others to desist; but they confessed that they could not, even if they were to die. In like manner others also sometimes confessed that they could by no means desist, to whom it was as often said that this did not excuse them, for thus all devils would excuse themselves. But they were told that they should go away or they would be driven away, until at length by suitable kinds of punishment they would be affected with disgust when doing such things, and thus, as usually takes place, by modes of punishment by evil spirits, they would put them off. Hence it is allowable to conclude that their natural instinct imbued in the life of the body is such, that not only do they feel the greatest pleasure in such evils, but they are also endowed with such cupidity from it that they cannot desist, just as wild beasts cannot desist from tearing to pieces. 1748, Feb. 5. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 644 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>644. Quod fateantur se non posse aliter facere<p>Iidem qui continue dolos moliebantur, et in iis ita inhaerebant, ut vix intermitterent, admoniti sunt ab aliis ut desisterent, sed fassi sunt, quod non possent, etsi morerentur, similiter etiam alii aliquoties fassi sunt, quod nequicquam possent desistere, quibus toties erat dictum quod id non excusat, quia sic omnes diaboli [se] <sup>1</sup></p><p>excusarent sed ut abirent seu abigerentur, usque dum per punitionis species convenientes taedio afficiantur similia patrandi, sic exuendi [sunt] modis punitionis malis, sicut fieri solet: inde concludere licet, quod naturalis instinctus eorum in vita corporis imbutus, ut non solum in talibus summam voluptatem sentiant, sed etiam quod tali cupiditate ejus praediti sint, ut non desistere possint, similiter ac ferae bestiae a lanienis. 1748, 5 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I.
