<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4018</h4><p>4018. On the portrayal of angelic Speech by means of clouds<p>In the world of lower spirits, also angelic mental imagery and speech is usually portrayed by variously shaped clouds, accompanied by some understanding. For when such things are presented as exist with the angels, some understanding goes along with them indicating what they symbolize, so that the lower spirits may learn.<p>An oblong vessel was displayed containing what seemed to be milk, which was turned into a cloud of the same shape. This bright cloud concentrated itself toward the center, in front of which there was something dark. This meant that the angels were coming together, but there was still some darkness. Then a cloud was portrayed that was almost bright, transforming into a shape like the human one, of about the same color, accompanied by an inner sight of the Lord; but a black cloud in front took away the sight of Him by which it was symbolized that they had spoken about matters of faith in the Lord, and that in the world of spirits this discussion turned into evil, thus into a black cloud.<p>Then two horse's heads were portrayed, with their mouth protruding, which were turned toward me, but the side of the mouth became wider, and began to appear different than the mouth of a horse. Thus it vanished. These things signified matters of the understanding, and knowledge. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4018</h4><p>4018. CONCERNING THE REPRESENTATION OF ANGELIC SPEECH BY MEANS OF CLOUDS.<p>In the world of lower spirits angelic ideas and discourses are wont to be represented by various forms of clouds, and with them perceptions; for when such things are exhibited as exist among the angels, in order that they may come to the knowledge of lower spirits, a certain perception accompanies them, indicating what they signify. An oblong vessel was represented in which there was an appearance of milk; this was turned into a white cloud of similar form, which concentrated itself toward the middle point, having on the front part something obscure, which signified that the angels were coming together, though there was yet some degree of obscurity. There was then represented a cloud almost white, which passed into a form similar to the human, being also nearly of the same color, with a perception of the Lord; but a black cloud coming before took away the sight of it, which signified that they spoke of things pertaining to faith in the Lord, and that in the world of spirits this was turned into evil; thus into a black cloud. Then there were represented two horses' heads turned towards me, with their faces prominent, but a part of the face became broader and began to appear otherwise than the face of a horse, and thus vanished. These signified intellectuals and scientifics. - 1748, November 20. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4018 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4018. De repraesentatione Loquelae angelicae per nubes<p>In mundo inferiorum spirituum etiam solent angelicae ideae et loquelae repraesentari per varias formas nubium, et cum iis perceptiones, cum enim sistuntur talia quae apud angelos, ut sciant spiritus inferiores, perceptio quaedam simul comitatur, quae indicat quid significant; repraesentatum vas oblongum in quo quasi lac, quod vertebatur in nubem similis formae, quae nubes candida, se concentrabat versus centrum, a parte anteriori erat aliquid obscurum, significans quod convenirent angeli, sed usque aliqua obscuritas esset. Tunc repraesentata nubes, quae candida fere, transibat sicut in formam humanae similem, talis fere coloris, cum perceptione Domini, sed nubes nigra antrorsum sustulit visum ejus, quo significabatur, quod loquuti sint de iis quae sunt fidei in Dominum, et quod in mundo spirituum, hoc versum est in malum; ita in nigram nubem. Tunc repraesentabantur bina capita equina, cum eorum prominente ore, quae versa ad me, sed pars oris facta latior, et incipiebat aliter apparere ac os equi, ita evanescebat, significabant intellectualia et scientifica. 1748, 20 Nov. </p>
