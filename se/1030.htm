<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1030</h4><p>1030. About introduction into gyres<p>When spirits are being introduced into spiraling gyres, so that their outward qualities may agree with their inward ones, that is, so that their speaking may agree with their inner feeling, called thinking, then the spirit in question is driven to speaking faster and forced to have the thinking follow. Yet because he is not used to having his thinking follow his speaking, this is done reluctantly, and consequently painfully. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1030</h4><p>1030. CONCERNING THE INAUGURATION OF GYRES <p>Spirits are inaugurated into gyres, in order that their externals may be in accord with their internals, namely, that their speech may be in accord with the internal sensation which is called thought. When a spirit is being inaugurated he is urged to a quicker speech, and is so compelled that the thought follows at the same time. He is, however, unaccustomed to this, as speech follows thought, and therefore it takes place with resistance, consequently with pain. </p>

De inauguratione gyrorum<p>Quando spiritus inaugurantur in gyros, nempe ut externa internis concordent, loquela nempe sensationi internae, quae vocatur cogitatio, tunc in citiorem loquelam agitur {a}, et cogitur ut simul cogitatio sequatur, quae tamen inassueta <sup>1</sup></p><p>est, ut sequatur loquela, ideo fit cum renisu, proinde cum dolore.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has inasueta </p>
