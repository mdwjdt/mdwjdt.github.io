<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3117</h4><p>3117. <sup>1</sup> # This is illustrated by someone who was saying he knows what he wants, to whom it was suggested that he knows nothing else but whatever tends toward his pleasure, and nothing besides that. So the pleasure was portrayed by an almost yellow color into which he was let, but then instantly withheld from slipping into it.<p>Then driven by another fantasy, he saw what I did not, that if he had not been held back, he would have slipped into a total self-destruction, so that now he no longer desires to be allowed to fall into his pleasures, which he foresees. Still he admits that even though he was evil, the Lord had sustained him. Now, having slipped into thinking of himself, he is said to be pressed by much anxiety. 1748, 10 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Following the author's indication, we are placing 3117 between 3115 and 3116. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3117</h4><p>3117. (THAT SPIRITS IN THE OTHER LIFE ARE NOT ONLY BEHELD IN FIXED [certis] PLACES, BUT THEIR BODIES IN A FIXED POSITION. <p>Certain [spirits] appeared in their places, standing up, who have told me further, that they walked [could walk] and indeed with body erect. Some [appeared] as within the body, with their head down, and back of their shoulders up. Some [appeared] sitting, upon a throne [solis]. Some also [appeared] sitting but not on conspicuous seats [conspicue]. Some [appeared] otherwise: as comes from various causes. Sometimes certain [spirits] appeared, to lie stretched out, and so forth. - 1748, September 10.) <p>(THAT ONE SPIRIT IS LED BY ANOTHER, ETC.) <p>(From much experience, it is known to me, that one spirit is led by another, and so forth, so that there is no one who is not led by another; which they also confessed, when it was shown to them.) </p>
