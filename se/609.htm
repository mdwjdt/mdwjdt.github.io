<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 609</h4><p>609. About philosophy - that it is worthless<p>Today, as I was on my way home and got back, I was moved with sadness, and I knew that the sadness originated with a certain spirit, who was upset. He came up to me, saying that in his lifetime he had been a philosopher, probably among the most famous, and had applied his mind to studies of that kind; and now, when he thought them over, he said that he was upset and moved by a great sadness, because he now saw and realized how worthless such pursuits in the world are, and that they are illusions, which take away all light from spiritual and Divine matters. He calls them manure, which is to be thrown away, and had prevented him until now from knowing spiritual, and even more, heavenly things. He is now with me, and sees me writing, and directs me. 1748, the 30th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 609</h4><p>609. CONCERNING PHILOSOPHY - THAT IT IS OF NO ACCOUNT <p>Today, when I left home and when I returned, I was affected with sadness, and I knew that this sadness was due to a certain spirit who was perturbed. He applied himself to me, saying, that in his age he had been such that he supposed that he had been amongst the most famous, and had applied his "animus" to such studies; and now as he turned them over in his mind, he said he was disturbed and affected with great sadness, and that he now saw and perceived how trifling are such things in the world, and that they are phantasies which take away all light from things spiritual and Divine. He called them dung which ought to be cast away, for they have hitherto prevented him from knowing spiritual and still more celestial things. He is now with me and sees and governs me as I write. 1748, Jan. 30. </p>

De philosophia, quod sit nauci<p>Hodie, quum domum irem et redii, tristitia affectus sum, et sciebam, quod tristitia orta esset a quodam spiritu, qui perturbatus esset, qui appulit ad me, dicens, quod sua aetate fuerit talis, et autumabat se inter famigeratissimos fuisse, et adplicuisse similibus studiis animum, et nunc cum volveret illa, se turbatum et multa tristitia affectum, dicebat, et quod nunc videret et perciperet, quam nauci sint talia in mundo, et quod phantasiae sint, quae <sup>1</sup></p><p>demunt omnem lucem spiritualibus et Divinis; vocat ea stercora, quae projicienda, et quae huc usque impediverunt eum, ne spiritualia, minus coelestia sciret; hic nunc mecum est, et me scribentem videt, regitque. 1748, die 30 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has sint; quae ut apparet </p>
