<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5750</h4><p>5750. Meanwhile purifications were being made constantly, because those who led an evil life, involved in adulteries, thefts, thus who had been outrageous atheists in the world, were not admitted, but were thrown into hell. Purification from such individuals was always going on; yet the case was the same as with the blood in the body, although it is continually purified, it nevertheless declines totally to the death of the body.<p>Consequently there is now a new heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5750</h4><p>5750. Meanwhile, purifications were occurring continually; for those who in the world led an evil life, in adulteries and thefts - thus wicked atheists - were not admitted, but were cast into hell. The purification from such ones went on continuously; but yet the case is as with the blood in the body although that is continually purified, still, it tends, notwithstanding, to the death of the whole body. <p>Hence there is now a new heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5750 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5750. Interea purificationes factae sunt continuae, nam qui malam vitam egerunt, in adulteriis, furtis, ita facinorosi athei in mundo, illi non admissi sunt, sed conjecti in infernum, purificatio a talibus semper perstiterat; sed usque se habuit sicut in corpore cum sanguine, tametsi ille continue purificatur, usque tamen vergit ad mortem totius. Inde nunc novum coelum. </p>
