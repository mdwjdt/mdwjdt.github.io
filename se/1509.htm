<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1509</h4><p>1509. Many things occur on the earths and in the heavens directly from the Lord<p>On the earths many things take place directly, as is evident from the case of the apostles, who sometimes, when they spoke, were inspired by the Holy Spirit, and the words they were to speak were given to them. This was direct inspiration. Yet the Lord wills that all and the least things go according to order, thus that they go as if of their own accord; for the Lord is Order. So He has established an Order such as is in the body, where all things down to the very least function as if on their own. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1509</h4><p>1509. THAT MANY THINGS ON EARTH AND IN THE HEAVENS ARE EFFECTED IMMEDIATELY BY THE LORD <p>That many things on earth are effected immediately is evident from the Apostles, who at times were inspired by the Holy Spirit when they spoke, and the words they should speak were given them, which was immediate inspiration. Nevertheless the Lord wills that each and all things should happen according to order, so that they should proceed, as it were, spontaneously. For the Lord is Order and thus establishes it, such as order in the body, wherein each and all things flow as of themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1509 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1509. Quod immediate a Domino fiant multa in terris et in coelis<p>Quod in terris multa fiant immediate, constat ab apostolis, qui quandoque, dum loquuti, a Spiritu Sancto fuerint inspirati, et iis data sint verba, quae loquerentur, quod immediata fuit inspiratio; sed usque omnia et singula vult Dominus, ut secundum ordinem eant, sic ut quasi sponte eant, nam Dominus est Ordo, sic Ordinem instituit <sup>1</sup></p><p>, qualis in corpore, ubi omnia et singula quasi ex se fluant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has instuit </p>
