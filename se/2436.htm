<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2436</h4><p>2436. Spirits also sleep<p>Last night there were many spirits around me, about someone or several of whom I spoke in the morning, and I heard that they had been sleeping, and in fact pleasantly, as I also perceived. So sleep is also a state proper to spirits, as it is to people on earth.<p>When I was nearly awake but before I woke up, various lights appeared to me, something bright having glittering bubbles, something darker, then something colored. I was told that there are lights like these in their sleep, with variety. And I also realized that they too had had dreams, and pleasant ones, without my having had dreams at the same time. For it is known that when a person on earth is in their company, the person has dreams together with them, spoken of several times [<a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="1882.htm">1882</a>]; but in this instance they had dreams, and I had not. 1748, 30 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2436</h4><p>2436. THAT SPIRITS ALSO SLEEP. <p>This night there were many spirits around me; in the morning I spoke concerning some one, or several of them, and I have heard that they were asleep, and indeed [in] a sweet [sleep]. This I also perceived, so that the state of spirits is also a sleep like man's. About the time concerning [circa vigiliam] before I awoke, there appeared to me various lights: a white one with glittering bosses [bullis], a certain obscure [one], then a colored one. I was told that there are such lights in their sleep, according to variety, and I also perceived that they also had dreams, and indeed pleasant [ones], and these without my having dreams at the same time; for it is known, that when man is in their society, he then has dreams together with them, of which [I have treated] several times; but now they had dreams, but not I. - 1748, June 30. </p>

Quod spiritus quoque dormiant<p>Hac nocte erant plures spiritus circum me, de quorum aliquo aut aliquibus loquutus mane, et audivi quod dormierint, et quidem dulce, quod quoque percepi; sic ut status spirituum quoque sit somnus, qualis hominis; circa vigiliam, antequam vigilarem, apparebant mihi <sup>1</sup></p><p>varia lumina, candidum cum nitidis bullis, obscurius quoddam, tum coloratum, dicebatur mihi, quod talia lumina sint in eorum somnis, secundum varietatem, et quoque percepi, quod somnia quoque habuerint, et quidem jucunda, et ea absque quod ego somnia haberem simul, nam notum est, cum homo in societate eorum est, tunc somnia cum iis habet, de quibus aliquoties [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2436/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2436/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1882" target=_top>1882</a>], sed nunc erant somnia iis, non ita mihi. 1748, 30 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has mihia ut apparet </p>
