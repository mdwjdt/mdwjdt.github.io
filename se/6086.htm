<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6086</h4><p>6086. Spiritual Light is the Divine wisdom<p>Worldly spirits do not grasp this, because they have a concept drawn from the light of the world. But it was shown to them that it is true. To a certain one who was in doubt about this because he had just as much light as others who were not worldly it was said that he did not see from his own light but from theirs. On this account their light was taken away, and left to his own light, he was in darkness. Subsequently he was sent to a place where worldly spirits were who although not in the light of heaven still could see. At first when he came there he saw nothing. Later he saw as they did, because his eyes were eyes for darkness, like the eyes certain birds have that see at night, and then he saw as if in daylight. That he nevertheless did not have spiritual light was shown to him. He was led back to the former place where there was spiritual light, and then he did not see until his prior former sight had been taken away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6086</h4><p>6086. SPIRITUAL LIGHT IS DIVINE WISDOM. <p>Worldly spirits do not perceive this, because they have their idea from the light of the world; but it was shown them that it is so. A certain one who was in doubt about that matter, inasmuch as he was as much in light as the others, who were not worldly, was told, that he does not see there from his own light, but from theirs. Wherefore, when their light was removed, he was left to his own light and was in darkness. He was afterwards let into a place where there were worldly [spirits], who, although not in the light of heaven, still saw. . When he came thither, he at first saw nothing; he afterwards saw as they did - for his eyes were adapted to darkness, as is the case with certain birds which see at night; and, then, he saw as if in the light. Nevertheless, he was shown that it has not spiritual light. He was brought back to the former place, where there was spiritual light; and then he did not see until the former sight was removed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6086 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6086. Quod Lux spiritualis sit Divina sapientia<p>Spiritus mundani hoc non percipiunt, quia ex luce mundi ideam habent, at ostensum illis est, quod ita sit, cuidam dubitanti de ea re, quia aeque erat in luce sicut alii, qui non mundani, dictum est, quod non videat ibi ex sua luce sed ex illorum, quare remota illorum luce, et relictus suae luci, erat in tenebris. Postea missus est in locum ubi mundani qui tametsi non in luce coeli usque videbant, illuc cum venit, primum nihil vidit, postea vidit sicut illi, erant enim oculi ejus pro tenebris, sicut sunt quibusdam avibus, quae vident noctu, et tunc videbat sicut in luce; quod tamen non lux spiritualis esset ostensum est illi, reductus est in locum priorem ubi erat lux spiritualis, et tunc non videbat, priusquam prior visus remotus est. </p>
