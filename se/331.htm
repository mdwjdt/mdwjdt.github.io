<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>331.在小孩子身上所看到的嫉妒的开始是最甜蜜的。今天，我通过经历获知，当互相争母亲时，小孩子所表现出的对其他小孩子的那种嫉妒是从一种最愉快的开始和爱，因而通过天堂流入的。因为当我被保持思想小孩子的嫉妒时，有活生生的声音从天上对我说，他们感受到一种天堂的甜蜜，这甜蜜照着激发它的物体而各不相同。由此可以断定，人里面的真正热情和渴望来自一个天堂的起点和爱本身；因此，它们通过天堂流入；但在天堂之外，它们一路上被灵人转变为对立物，同样被作为接受者的每个世人转变为对立物；流注照着他的本质形式和那形式的变化，以及其心智的状态变化而遭到弯曲。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 331</h4><p>331. The beginning of jealousy that is seen in little children is most sweet<p>From an experience today, I learned that the apparent envy in little children toward other little children when in rivalry over the mother, arises from a most pleasant beginning, and from love, thus through heaven. For while I was being kept in thought about envy in little children, it was said to me aloud from heaven that they felt a heavenly sweetness, which varied according to the individuals.<p>From this one can conclude that the very passions and desires in a person all come from a heavenly starting point, and from Love Itself, therefore through heaven; but that on the way, outside of heaven, they are turned by spirits into something opposite, likewise by each person as receiver [they are qualified] by his or her essential form, and its variations with their changing states of mind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 331</h4><p>331. CONCERNING THE BEGINNING OF ENVY: WITH LITTLE CHILDREN IT IS PERCEIVED TO BE VERY SWEET <p>I have learnt today from experience that that envy which appears with little children towards other little children when they strive with each other for the mother, flows from a most delightful beginning and from love, thus through heaven. For when I was kept in thought concerning the envy of little children it was said to me by a living voice from heaven, that they perceived a heavenly sweetness, and this with variety according to the objects [which excite it]. Hence it can be concluded that the very passions and cupidities in man are all from a heavenly beginning and from love itself, thus they inflow through heaven: but that outside heaven, in the way, they are bent by spirits into things contrary. It is similar with every man as it is with an object, [the influx is bent] according to his essential form, and the variations of that form, and the changes of the state of those variations. </p>

[Quod principium] <sup>1</sup></p><p>invidiae quod apud infantes percipitur, sit dulcissimum<p>Ab experientia hodie edoctus sum, quod invidia illa apparens, quae apud infantes erga alios infantes, dum aemulantur de matre, fluat a principio jucundissimo, exque amore, ita per coelum, dum enim tenebar in cogitatione de invidia infantum, mihi dicebatur e coelo, viva voce, quod perceperint dulcedinem coelestem, et quidem cum varietate secundum objecta; inde concludi potest, quod ipsae passiones et cupiditates in homine, omnes ex principio coelesti, et ex Ipso Amore sic percoelum influant <sup>1</sup></p><p>, sed quod in via extra coelum a spiritibus in contrarium flectantur, similiter ac in unoquovis homine, ut objecto, secundum ejus formam essentialem, et istius formae variationes, et harum status mutationes.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has De principio deletum ut videtur, sed emendatio haec omissa<p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
