<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4093</h4><p>4093. About someone touching my hands<p>When I was folding my hands, I felt as if not I but someone else was folding them. It was some spirit who said that he felt entirely as if he himself were folding my hands instead of myself, so that my sense of touch was wholly communicated to another, who then possessed my hand together with its sense of touch. 1748, 28 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4093</h4><p>4093. CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO TOUCHED MY HAND.<p>On shaking hands with a certain person I had a perception as if it were not myself but some other one who grasped [the proffered hand]. A certain spirit said that he distinctly felt that it was he who grasped the hand instead of myself; so that it seems that my touch was really communicated to another, and he then had possession of my hand with its sense of touch. - 1748, November 27. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4093 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4093. De quodam tangente manus meas<p>Quidam cum complicarem manus, percepi quasi quod ego non complicarem, sed alter, erat quidam qui dixit, quod is sentiat se prorsus complicare manus, loco mei, sic ut tactus meus prorsus alii communicatus sit, et tunc possederit manus cum tactu. 1748, 28 Nov. </p>
