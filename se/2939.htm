<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2939</h4><p>2939. Some spirits do not put on a person's memory right away,<p>some do so all [at once]<p>I have observed several times that spirits were coming, new ones, who had let themselves be taught about the things entrusted to me, and that other spirits were instructing them, thus that some were strangers, and some natives. The reason why some do not at once put on a person's memory has now occurred to me, that they are those who have not been admitted into the society of those who are native. As soon as they come into their society, they acquire the same things as those there, for each one has communication from many, so that they do not know otherwise but that these [new ones] are more remote spirits [of the same society]. About this elsewhere, if the Lord sees fit. 1748, 26 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2939</h4><p>2939. THAT CERTAIN SPIRITS DO NOT IMMEDIATELY PUT ON THE MEMORY OF MAN: THAT SOME PUT ON ALL OF IT. <p>I have several times observed, that spirits arrived, who, as I know, allowed themselves to be informed concerning those things that are in [apud] me, and that other spirits instructed them: so that some are strangers, some natives; from whence is the cause, that some do not immediately put on the memory of man: it now occurs to me, that they are those who have not been admitted into the society of those who are natives: as soon as they come into their society, they put on similar things with them: for such is the communication of each one with many, so that they may not know different. Besides which, there are more remote spirits, of whom I shall treat elsewhere, should the Lord think worthy. - 1748, August 26. </p>
