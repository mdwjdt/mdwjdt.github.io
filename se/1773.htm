<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1773</h4><p>1773. It seems that the ancients made mention of these spirits (see whether they are spoken of in the Word), [namely, that they are kept there] even until they have forgotten self, and everything connected with love of self. Even people of old outside of the ancient Church, though derived from the ancient Church, were acquainted with this matter, calling them the "waters of forgetfulness," which they would drink [in Hades]. But here there are no waters. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1773</h4><p>1773. The ancients seem to have alluded to this class of persons (:see whether they are spoken of in the Word:) so long as they were not absorbed in the love of self and of the things pertaining to that love. Of these things the ancients had knowledge also who were without the Ancient Church, but still from the Ancient Church, and they called them the Lethean waters which were to be drunk; but yet there was no water there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1773 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1773. De iis videntur veteres meminisse (videatur <sup>1</sup></p><p>num in Verbo), [nempe quod ibi teneantur,] usque <sup>2</sup></p><p>dum sui et eorum quae sui amoris fuerunt, obliti sint; de quibus etiam cognitionem habuerunt veteres, extra Ecclesiam antiquam, sed ab Ecclesia antiqua, vocaruntque letheas aquas, quas biberent, sed ibi nulla aqua.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has meminisse,<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Verbo: </p>
