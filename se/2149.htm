<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2149</h4><p>2149. But just as it is with everything else, all this inflow is qualified in the receivers or objects by their character, nature, form. When this reminder constantly streams in, as it does with some, with others it is distorted, and turned, depending on their lives or desires, into a passion only; with yet others, something else. With many it is turned only into lust for renown, just to obtain the objects of their passions. With some, it almost vanishes.<p>In short, it is qualified by their lives, that is, their passions and longings. 1748, 31 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2149</h4><p>2149. But as happens in everything else, every such influx is circumstanced in its subjects or objects, according to their disposition, nature, form, so that although such continual incentive [admonitio] flows into some, with certain it is changed, according to their lives or cupidities, into passion alone; with others it occurs differently; with many it is changed into the lust of fame, merely for the attainment of their loves; with some it scarcely makes its appearance. In a word, it is circumstanced according to their lives, that is, according to cupidities and desires. - 1748, May 31. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2149 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2149. Sed sicut in omnibus reliquis fit, omnis talis influxus, in subjectis seu objectis se habet secundum eorum indolem, naturam, formam, cum talis admonitio continua influit, ut in quosdam, apud aliquos pervertitur, et secundum eorum vitas seu cupiditates, in solam cupidinem, apud alios aliter, apud plerosque in famae solum cupidinem ob suos amores aucupandos, apud quosdam evanescit fere; verbo se habet secundum vitas eorum, hoc est, secundum cupiditates, et desideria. 1748, 31 Maj. </p>
