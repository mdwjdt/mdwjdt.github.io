<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5571</h4><p>5571. About numbers in heaven<p>Numbers sometimes appear in heaven؛on] a page full of them, and also on the walls, which signify such things as the heavenly ones are thinking, but which scarcely anyone is able to know other than those who are from such a heaven. When the numbers are simple, as for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., to 12, they have a meaning that accords with the descriptions in Arcana Coelestia; but when they are composite they have another meaning, for example, 358:90356 means "God be with you." And every number means something, but their meaning varies according to those things which are above. Take 358 here: these numbers determine a meaning according to the series in such a number, which one is there and then there. Those who are from that kingdom immediately understand and do this without instruction, as it were of themselves. Each and every mental image has its own number; in general even numbers correspond to good, like, 2, 4, 8, and odd numbers to truth, like 3, 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5571</h4><p>5571. ABOUT NUMBERS IN HEAVEN. <p>Sometimes numbers appear, a paper filled with them; they also appear on the walls - which signify such things as the celestials think; but scarcely anyone is able to know them except those who belong to such [i.e. celestial] heaven. When the numbers are simple - as, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., to 12 - then they have a significance according to those things which are described in the Arcana Coelestia; but when they are compound, they have another sense: for example, 358/90356. These signify, God be with thee; and every single number something: the sense named, however, is according to those things which are above [referred to]. [Take] 358, here. These numbers, which are here and there, determine the sense into such a series. They who are of that [i.e. celestial] kingdom, understand immediately; and this without instruction, as if of themselves. Every single idea has its own number. In general, even numbers correspond to good, as 2, 4, 8, and odd numbers - as 3, 9 - to truth. </p>

De numeris in coelo<p>Numeri apparent quandoque, illis plena charta, et quoque ad parietes, quae significant talia quae coelestes cogitant, sed vix aliquis scire potest quam illi qui ex tali coelo, cum numeri simplices sunt, tunc significant secundum illa quae descripta in Arcanis Coelestibus, <sup>1</sup></p><p>ut 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc. ad 12; at cum compositi sunt alium sensum habent, sicut 358/90356: haec significant Deus sit tecum, et unusquisque numerus aliquid, sed variant sensum secundum illa quae supra sunt, hic 358, illi numeri determinant sensus seriem in talem, qui ibi et ibi; qui ex illo regno sunt statim intelligunt, et hoc absque informatione, quasi ex seipsis, unaquaevis idea habet suum numerum, in genere paria correspondent bono, ut 2, 4, 8, et imparia vero, ut 3, 9.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4264" target=_top>AC 4264</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4495" target=_top>4495</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5265" target=_top>5265</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5291" target=_top>5291</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5708" target=_top>5708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10127" target=_top>10127</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5571/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10217" target=_top>10217-10219</a>, praeter alibi </p>
