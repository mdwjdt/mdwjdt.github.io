<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4030</h4><p>4030. I realized that such are the female spirits that represent the mucus of the nostrils and that they steal in there to lie in wait. And they are adulteresses, and devoid of conscience. I was also shown that they are such, and devoid of conscience, by actual experience, for it was granted me to see that there is something that would hold the conscience intact, but they had none of it, and were surprised that there was anyone who has a conscience; so they are the mucus of the nostrils, which it was also granted to tell them, thus that they are filthy and must be rejected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4030</h4><p>4030. I perceived that their quality was that of those who represent the mucus of the nostrils, and that they insinuate themselves thither for the purpose of insidiously lying in wait. They are adulteressess and void of conscience. That they are such, and that they are wholly destitute of conscience, was shown me by living experience, for it was given me to perceive that there is [usually] something which holds the conscience under restraint, but with them there was nothing of the kind; they wondered that there should be anyone possessed of conscience. They are therefore the mucus of the nostrils, which also it was given to say to them and that they were therefore vile and rejectable. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4030 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4030. Percepi quod tales sint quae mucum narium referunt, seque insinuant illuc, insidiandi causa, suntque adulterae, et absque conscientia; ostensum mihi quoque quod tales, et quod absque conscientia per vivam experientiam, nam percipere datum aliquid quod teneret conscientiam, sed ii nullam habebant, mirati quod aliquis esset, qui conscientiam habeat; quare sunt muci narium; quod iis quoque dicere datum, ita quod sint spurci et rejiciendi. </p>
