<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1216</h4><p>1216. About the twelve disciples of Jesus<p>Inquiry was made among spirits about the disciples, for the purpose of teaching those who were from the planet Jupiter why people of lower condition, such as fishermen, were chosen, but not any from among the intelligentsia. Having heard them [give the reason], I am free to repeat it here. It was because at that time, many were brought up learning a lot of nonsense and foolish ideas, to the point where they were unable to grasp matters of belief the way the uneducated do, who understand, and can believe them better. Therefore, they were chosen in preference to more educated people. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1216</h4><p>1216. CONCERNING THE TWELVE DISCIPLES OF JESUS <p>For the purpose of instructing those who were from the planet Jupiter, inquiry was made among spirits why men of lowly condition, such as fishermen, were chosen as Disciples, and not some of the learned. Because I heard this it is allowable to relate that at that time most men were imbued with trifling things and the like, to the degree that they were unable to grasp those things which are of faith, as do the unlearned who grasp these things more readily and can believe them; therefore they were chosen in preference to the learned. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1216 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1216. De duodecim discipulis Jesu<p>Disquirebatur inter spiritus de discipulis, ut instruerent eos qui erant ex tellure Jovis, quare inferioris conditionis homines, ut piscatores, eligerentur, non autem ex doctioribus, et quia audivi eos, huc referre liceat, nempe quod tunc temporis plerique imbuti essent nugis et similibus, adeo ut non capere possent ea quae sunt fidei, sicut indocti, qui melius ea capiunt, et credere possunt, ideo prae doctioribus, electi sunt. </p>
