<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5968</h4><p>5968. It was vividly shown to them that they were not in high places but in hells, that the appearance that they were in high places was a product of their vision in fantasy, which is like that of those who walk in their sleep, because when this vision was taken away from them, they immediately appeared in hells. This was seen several times. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5968</h4><p>5968. It was shown them, to the life, that they were not on heights, but in hells. That they appeared to be on heights, was owing to their phantastic sight, which is like that of those who walk in dreams; for, when that sight was taken away from them, they at once appeared in hells. This was seen frequently. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5968 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5968. Ostensum illis ad vivum, quod non essent in altis sed in infernis, quod apparerent esse in altis quod esset ex visu eorum phantastico, qui est qualis est illis qui ambulant in somniis; cum enim ille visus eis ademtus erat, illico apparebant in infernis, hoc saepius visum. </p>
