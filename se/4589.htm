<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4589</h4><p>4589. About those who most deeply foster deceptions against the neighbor and outwardly appear sincere, also spoken of just above [<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>]<p>This hell was from the left parts, toward the back quarter. That gang was cast out by the others and at once injected the urge to bite the tongue and also some pain in the extreme edges of the tongue. They were cast forth into a hell more toward the front, as spoken of above [<a href="4574.htm">4574</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>], and a watery [mist] appeared there, into which they were cast. Those who were cast forth, when immersed below, came into their own atmosphere. This process lasted for weeks. Finally, because they did not desist, the watery mist penetrated also into the former hell and swallowed them up. The watery mist is outward sincerity. They are extremely pernicious. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4589</h4><p>4589. A HELL. CONCERNING THOSE WHO INMOSTLY CHERISH TREACHERY AGAINST THE NEIGHBOR, AND, WITHOUT, APPEAR HONEST, CONCERNING WHOM, ALSO, [I HAVE SPOKEN] JUST ABOVE.<p>This hell was in the left parts, towards the region of the back. That crew was cast out from the others, and they immediately inspired a longing to bite the tongue, and also a certain pain in the extreme edges of the tongue. They were thrust forth into a hell more in front, as above said, and there appeared, there, a watery [mist], into which they were cast. The ones thrust forth, when immersed beneath, came into their own atmosphere. This lasted for weeks. At length, because they did not desist, the watery [mist] penetrated also into the former hell, and swallowed them up. The watery [mist] is exterior honesty. These are most pernicious. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4589 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4589. Infernum<p>De illis qui intime fovent dolos contra proximum, et extus apparent sinceri, de quibus etiam mox supra [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4589/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4582" target=_top>4582</a>] Fuit id infernum a sinistris versus tergalem plagam, turba illa ejiciebatur ab aliis statim injiciebant pruritum mordendi linguam quoque dolorem aliquem in ultimis limbis linguae, illi projecti sunt in infernum anterius, ut supra dictum <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4589/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4574" target=_top>[4574</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4589/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4582" target=_top>4582</a>] apparuit aqueum ibi in quod injiciebatur, projecti cum immersi subter veniebant in suam atmosphaeram, hoc per septimanas perstabat, tandem quia non desistebant, aqueum penetrabat in prius infernum etiam absorbsit illos; aqueum est sincerum exterius: sunt perniciosissimi. </p>
