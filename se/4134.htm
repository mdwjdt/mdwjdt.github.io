<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4134</h4><p>4134. It was shown by means of a variety of spiritual portrayals how they would look upon what was written if it were without the confirmatory statements. As they were reading, the spiritual portrayals were effected by means of a bright light radiating in various directions - thus swiftly, and beautifully, as if it were spiritual, and this by quickly changing shapes, from one spiritual shape into another, in a wonderful manner. It is a figurative spiritual language, expressive of spiritual qualities. 1749, 9 Jan. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4134</h4><p>4134. It was shown moreover by various spiritual representations, how they would look upon what was written if destitute of the parallel confirmatory matter which was now to be read. These spiritual representations were effected by a pure light, variously radiating, so swiftly and beautifully as if it were something spiritual, and that too by rapid changes of form, one spiritual form passing into another in a wonderful manner. Spiritual speech, however, is representative, expressing spiritual things. - 1749, January 9. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4134 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4134. Variis repraesentationibus spiritualibus ostensum, quomodo aspicerent scriptum si absque parallelis dictis confirmantibus, quum legerent, repraesentationes spirituales fiebant per candidam lucem, varie radiatam, ita celeriter, et pulchre, sicut spirituale esset, et hoc cito per mutationes formarum, unius formae spiritualis in alteram, ut mirabile, est repraesentativa loquela spiritualis, exprimens spiritualia. 1749, 9 Jan. </p>
