<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3855</h4><p>3855. Someone with me, asleep<p>Someone was sent to me who was so fast asleep that he was not at all concerned about the attacks of evil spirits, and I was also given the realization that the sleep of some is such that they believe themselves to be utterly safe, because protected by the Lord, as I sensed from the aura of his sleeping state. The evil spirits began to attack, but confessed that they could do nothing. 1748, 4 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3855</h4><p>3855. A CERTAIN ONE WITH ME WHO WAS ASLEEP.<p>There was a certain one sent to me who was in such a sleep, that he cared nothing for the infestations of evil spirits, and it was also given to perceive, that such is the sleep of some, that they believe themselves most secure because guarded by the Lord. This was perceived from his state of sleep and from his sphere. The evil spirits then began their infestations, but they confessed that they could effect nothing. - 1748, November 4. </p>
