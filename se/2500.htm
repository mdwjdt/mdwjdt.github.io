<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2500</h4><p>2500. They are of the kind [living] in palaces who do not at all strive toward the good of society, but who only pretend, looking out for themselves, and who are consequently unfit for any function in society, in fact useless, because they above all love idleness, provided only they can live sumptuously, with fine clothes, and grow rich having no other cares. People such as these grow accustomed to such deceptions, and make their way inside and are even esteemed, before others. They become intimate particularly by dispensing sundry flatteries and pretended favors in dealing with those who administer the master's goods, so that they may thereby grow rich and thus secretly, without the master knowing, enjoy his goods, praising those from whom they obtain profit, also making friends with cooks, and accountants, and especially with female housekeepers, maids and the like, so that all things will turn out to their profit. 1748, 3 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2500</h4><p>2500. (They are of the class of such as [living] in palaces [aulis] never exert themselves for the good of society, but only feign [and] aim at their own good, an so are unfitted for employment in society, yea are useless, because they especially love ease [otium]; they can only live sumptuously, with magnificent garments, and grow rich, caring for nothing else. Such accustom [habituate] themselves to the like craft, and insinuate themselves more than others, yea are also praised. Especially do they get intimates for themselves by various [sorts of] flattery, and feigning [of good] offices, with those who dispose the goods of their master [domini], so that hence they may grow rich, and thus in a stealthy manner their master being unconscious [thereof], may enjoy his good; therefore praise those from whom they derive any gain; so also make friends to themselves of cooks, and treasurers, [and] especially of housekeepers [administratices] and maids, and the like, so that all things will conduce to their emolument. - 1748, July 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2500 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2500. Ex genere eorum sunt, qui in aulis nihil usquam ad societatis bonum student, sed solum simulant, sibi student, sic sunt quoad functionem in societate inhabiles, imo inutiles, quia otium imprimis amant, modo possint opipare vivere, splendidis vestibus, et ditescere, nihil aliud curantes, tales adsuescunt similibus dolis, seque prae aliis insinuant, imo quoque laudantur. Imprimis familiares sibi faciunt varia assentatione, et simulatione officiorum, ex <sup>1</sup></p><p>iis qui disponunt domini bona, ut inde ditescant, et ita clam, domino <sup>2</sup></p><p>inscio, fruantur ejus bono, sic laudantes eos, a quibus aliquid lucri capiunt, sicut etiam sibi amicos faciunt coquos, tum thesaurarios, cumprimis administratrices, ancillas, et similes, ut omnia sibi cedant in lucrum. 1748, 3 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has cum<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Domino </p>
