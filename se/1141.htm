<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1141</h4><p>1141. How often such spirits as these have spoken with me, and said abusive things to me-how very often, because these things struck them as paradoxes. Some also came today who were like this, and who had therefore thought badly of my life's activities. Well, the heaven of spirits is almost full of such people, but all who are in heaven think differently. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1141</h4><p>1141. How often, how very often, such spirits have spoken with me and said abusive things, because these things seemed to them as paradoxes. Moreover, there were some spirits with me today who were of such a nature, and who therefore thought evilly of the acts of my life. In brief, the heaven of spirits is almost full of such spirits; it is, however, otherwise with all those who are in heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1141 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1141. Tales spiritus mecum quamsaepe loquuti sunt, et opprobria mihi dixerunt, quampluries, quia ea ut paradoxa iis obvenerunt, praeter hodie aliqui, qui similes fuerunt, qui male de actis vitae meae ideo cogitarunt, in summa, coelum spirituum talibus est fere plenum, aliter vero omnes ii qui in coelo sunt. </p>
