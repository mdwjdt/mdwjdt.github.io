<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3065</h4><p>3065. whether there is much of higher knowledge, and what kind, or whether there is little, whether there is knowledge of truth, whether in that state of mind there is knowledge of the falsity of that [idea of] truth. All the differences go on without limit. And furthermore, angelic spirits grasp still more qualities that lie more deeply within, and angels even more, contained in every particular or in the whole.<p>So it can be recognized at once what a spirit is like from only one word, when the Lord grants them to perceive it, for in each mental image is the person, varying in regard to state. And they know in what way the outer characteristics, specifically the tone, and the earthly or outer mental image, differ from the inward ones- among still more things in general that cannot so easily be told. 1748, 6 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3065</h4><p>3065. Also whether the idea is somewhat full [plenior]: whether much knowledge [pertains thereto], and of what quality: also whether but little knowledge [pertains thereto], whether in that state, knowledge of the true, or knowledge of the false [pertains] to that [idea] of the true. All the differences are indefinite in number: and, moreover, angelic spirits apprehend more things still, which are more interior: and angels, still more things, in each particular or universal. Wherefore, the quality of a spirit can be immediately recognized from a single word, when the Lord grants them to perceive: for in every idea is the man with variety according to state: and they also know how externals, to wit, sound, and the natural or external idea disagree with interiors. Besides, still more things in general, which cannot be so [easily] told. - 1748, September 6.) </p>
