<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3296</h4><p>3296. Continuation about the inhabitants of a certain other world or solar system in the starry heaven<p>When their god whom they had worshipped, spoken of earlier [<a href="3267.htm">3267-3286</a>], had become angry at being thus exposed to his spirits-having become angry, he was trying to harm me by his own methods, by throwing himself upon my head, and I do not know what other curses or magic tricks he tried, but what he practiced in his own way was felt. I was feeling something within me like air being breathed out. I told him that I know about how this is done, that is, how they breathe when they are moving the lips [<a href="3278.htm">3278</a>], among other like tricks that I do not remember, telling him that he cannot harm me at all, seeking the while to sleep.<p>And then I fell asleep, and dreamed about my lost writings, <sup>1</sup>and the fireplaces in which they were burnt up. Awakened from that sleep, I saw around me many spirits, also some who were of that earth, as well as good angelic spirits in midst of the crowd of them.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See the preface to Experientiae Spirituales, Vol. I, pp. xxx-xxxiii. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3296</h4><p>3296. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF ANOTHER WORLD, OF A CERTAIN UNIVERSE, IN THE STARRY HEAVEN.<p>When their god, whom they worshipped, and whom [I have mentioned] previously, was angry, at being thus exposed to his spirits, having become angry, he attempted to injure me, in his modes, by casting himself on [superinjiciendo] my head: I do not know the nature of his curses, or magic, but that he practiced them in his manner was felt. I felt something within me, like an expiration of air. I said to him, that I knew how this takes place, to wit, how they respire, when the lips are moved, besides other things which I do not remember. I said that he could do me no injury; meanwhile I sought to sleep, and so fell into slumber, and dreamed something concerning my lost writings, and the fire-places in which they were burnt. I awaked from that sleep and perceived around me many spirits, also [some] who were of this earth; then also, good angelic spirits in the midst of their crowd. </p>
