Finally, toward the planet Mars, and there on one side they found a more accessible place for struggling out. Yet it was still an obscure place, because such spirits are not found there either, only those that are nevertheless compatible to some degree. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3268</h4><p>3268. Wherefore they proceeded, as it were, by extending but still by proceeding elsewhere; [the volume] sought, or [they] sought some place where they could struggle out; but for some time in vain [for the reason, that they should have spirits with whom they should be associated, so that they could have been able to come to me): at length [they proceeded] towards the planet Mars, and there, on one side, they found a freer place for struggling out, but still an obscure [place], inasmuch as such spirits are not found there; it is only [known] that they are still capable of being conjoined in some respect. </p>
