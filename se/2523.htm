<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2523</h4><p>2523. Sciences are not to be rejected, and it is the same as with pleasures, which are not rejected but joined on<p>Sciences are not to be rejected for the reason that they cause people to become insane when they seek wisdom from them in spiritual and heavenly matters, in which case they corrupt and blind. But if by means of them truths are supported, then they enlighten, because sciences are proper to mankind.<p>Neither are pleasures of mind and body to be rejected for the reason that they destroy and blind people, but they are allowed to enjoy them for the use, as explained before [<a href="2506.htm">2506-2508</a>], provided they are joined to the uses. For pleasures are the life of the body, so they have also been given for uses. 1748, 4 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2523</h4><p>2523. THAT THE SCIENCES ARE NOT TO BE REJECTED, AND IT IS SIMILAR WITH PLEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT REJECTED BUT APPLIED. <p>The sciences are not therefore to be rejected, because they cause a man to be insane, when he wishes from them to be wise in spiritual and celestial things; thus [used] they pervert and blind; but if truths are confirmed by them, they then illuminate, because man is in sciences. Likewise the pleasures which [belong] to the mind [animi] and body are not to be rejected because they destroy and blind man, but he is left to enjoy them for [ad] the use as before; thus they may only be applied to uses, for pleasures are the life of the body, wherefore also they are given to [bestowed on] uses. - 1748, July 4. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2523 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2523. Quod scientiae non rejiciendae, et quod simile sit ac voluptates, quae nec rejiciuntur, sed applicantur<p>Non ideo scientiae rejiciendae, quia insanire faciunt hominem <sup>1</sup></p><p>, dum ab iis sapere vult in spiritualibus et coelestibus, sic pervertunt et occoecant, at si per eas confirmantur veritates, tunc illuminant, quia homo in scientiis est: sicut nec voluptates quae animi et corporis rejiciendae, quia hominem perdunt, et occoecant, sed iis relinquitur frui ad usum, ut prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2523/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2506" target=_top>2506-2508</a>], sic modo applicentur usibus, nam voluptates sunt vita corporis, quare etiam datae sunt usibus. 1748, 4 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
