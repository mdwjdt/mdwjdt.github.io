<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 987</h4><p>987. On the communication of human mental images with spirits<p>Human thought is communicated to some spirits by speech, or by thought reduced to words and then to mental images from which a meaning arises. For some, the meaning is richer through words, that is, it is richer using the mental image conveyed by a word, for others [through] thoughts just like those in a person who visualizes them imaginatively, as when we direct our mind to any subject, and picture many points to ourselves as if they were at the same time visual objects, about which we afterwards speak or write.<p>This whole composite idea, or imaginative portrayal, is normally communicated in its entirety to spirits, but its impact varies with the abilities of the individual spirit - for the angels grasp simultaneously what is in the mental image, and what is inside of the mental image. 1748, 26 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 987</h4><p>987. CONCERNING THE COMMUNICATION OF THE IDEAS OF MAN WITH SPIRITS <p>Man's thought is communicated to some spirits by means of speech, that is, by thought distinguished into words, thus into ideas, whence arises the meaning. With some this is done more fully by means of words, that is, the idea of the word and its meaning is fuller. To some the thoughts are just as they are in man, together with his speculation and imagination, as when a man holds his mind intent upon some subject, and represents to himself many things as though they were at the same time seen, about which he afterwards speaks or writes. The whole of this composite idea, or imaginative representation, is usually communicated to spirits in its entirety, but a spirit's capability of receiving it is varied according to his faculties. Angels apprehend at the same time the things that are in the idea, and those that are within it. 1748, Feb. 26. </p>
