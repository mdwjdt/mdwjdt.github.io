<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 421</h4><p>421. More are now seeking Peter than before, so as to gain admittance into heaven<p>It was plainly shown to me that Peter was cast down out of heaven [13a, 67a]. Since that time I heard nothing about Peter until today, when I was told that now more [souls] than ever before are coming and adoring Peter, entreating him to let them into Heaven. The reason may be that something has just been revealed to those called the Jesuits, to the effect that Peter had been let down out of heaven, and that they can no longer approach him, as souls just arriving from the world did previously. Whether there is another reason, I do not yet know. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;422 does not occur in the original. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 421</h4><p>421. THAT NOW MORE SEEK PETER THAN FORMERLY, IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BE INTRODUCED INTO HEAVEN <p>That Peter was cast down out of heaven was manifestly shown me. <sup>1</sup>Since that time I have heard nothing concerning him until today, when it was told me that more now come and adore Peter than before, asking him to let them into heaven. Perhaps the reason is that now something has been disclosed to those called Jesuits, that Peter has been sent down from heaven, and that they can no longer approach him, as souls first arrived from the world formerly did. Whether there is any other cause, I do not yet know. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This is described in WE 1215 and 3116. <p>2.&nbsp;There is no n. 422 in the manuscript. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 421 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>421. Quod nunc plures quaerant Petrum, quam antea, ut introducantur in coelum<p>Quod Petrus e coelo dejectus sit, hoc mihi manifeste ostensum fuit [13a], [67a]], post id tempus nihil audivi de Petro, quam hodie, cum mihi dictum, quod nunc plures veniant et adorent Petrum, petentes ut intromittat eos in Coelum, quam prius; causa forte est, quod nunc Jesuitis dictis aliquid detectum est, quod Petrus e coelo demissus sit, et quod amplius non possint eum adire, sicut animae primum ex mundo, prius: num alia causa nondum scio. </p>
