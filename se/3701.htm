<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3701</h4><p>3701. The magical artifices by which they enticed them were numerous; as first, that they persuaded them by portraying that the Lord had spoken to them and had promised that after they had undergone several punishments, they would be welcomed into heaven. Moreover they were able, when they were with me, to speak as if they were somewhere else, where the good were, so that their voice was heard to be coming out of a society of good spirits, as if they were there.<p>Then [they persuaded them] that they could at the same time be with others, and convince them, appealing to their inclinations, thus that they could at the same time be with many, implying that they could be present everywhere. This was accomplished by magic, by their following the mental imagery poured into them which enabled them to find those who were flowing in - something easily done in the other life. Hence because [one] served as medium of so many societies, she easily found every single society, and was then able to breathe into each one a feeling in accord with their inclination, simply attaching herself to the mental imagery that was flowing in.</p><p>[2] But how she slipped in I did not observe, but it is second nature with them, because in the world they also steal in in this manner. They likewise pretend innocence, portraying a little one whom they take in their arms and kiss, which she also portrayed. One thing shown to me was how they persuade, displaying before the societies a white flame encircling the head, which they imagined to be a sign of heavenly or angelic understanding. That she so displayed it before many, I now realize, by seeing which flame the onlookers are at once persuaded that they are angels - perhaps this is the case with them. Many magical arts besides were shown. It is also one of their arts that they suddenly betake themselves out of the sight of others, and render themselves invisible. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3701</h4><p>3701. The magical arts by which they enticed these [societies] were numerous; as, first, that they would persuade them by representation that the Lord spoke with them, and promised that, after they had endured certain punishments he would receive them to heaven. They were able moreover, when present with me, to speak as if they were in another place, where the good were, so that their voice was heard from a society of the good, just as if they were there. In like manner they could be at the same time present with others, and persuade them according to their [temper and] genius and so likewise with still more at the same time, thus inducing the belief that they had a kind of ubiquity, which was magically effected by following the ideas infused into them, whereby they could discover those who flowed in, which is easily done in the other life; for when one of this class of spirits acts as a subject of so many societies, she can easily find any particular one. She can thus inspire anyone with affection according to their genius [i. e. the genius of the societies], by simply applying herself to the ideas which flowed in. Yet the particular manner in which she insinuated herself I did not perceive, but she contracted the ability from her nature, in as much as she had thus also insinuated herself while in the world. In like manner they simulate innocence by representing an infant which they take [in their arms] and kiss; which she also represented. One thing in particular was shown me; namely, in what manner she affected persuasion, which was by representing in full view before the eyes of the societies a white flame encircling the head. This they supposed to be a sign of the celestial or angelic intellectual. That she thus represented it in the presence of multitudes is now perceived, as also that as soon as it is beheld the persuasion is induced that they are angels, and thus perhaps that they are with them. Beside these there are various familiar arts of a magical kind, among which is this, that they suddenly vanish from the sight of others, and render themselves invisible. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3701 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3701. Magicae artes quibus allexerunt eos, fuerunt plures, sicut primum quod persuaserint repraesentatione quod Dominus cum iis loquutus sit, et quod promiserit, [quod] postquam sustinuerint aliquas poenas, in coelum acciperentur; praeterea potuerunt, cum penes me, loqui sicut essent alibi, ubi boni, sic ut vox eorum audita ex societate bonorum, sicut ibi essent; tum quod possent simul penes alios esse, et iis persuadere, secundum eorum genios, ita simul apud plures, ita inducentes quasi possent esse ubivis praesentes, quod magice factum, sequendo ideas sibi infusas, per quas potuere invenire eos, qui influebant, quod in altera vita facile; inde quia pro subjecto erat tot societatum, unamquamvis facile inveniebat; inspirare sic potuit cuivis affectionem secundum eorum genium, modo se applicando ideis, quae influebant; sed quomodo se insinuavit, non percepi, sed ex natura hoc traxit, quia in mundo sic quoque se insinuant: similiter innocentiam simulant, repraesentando infantem, quem accipiunt et osculantur; quod etiam repraesentavit. Unum mihi ostensum, quomodo persuasit, repraesentando coram societatibus candidam flammam circum caput eis ostensam, quod putabant signum esse intellectualis coelestis seu angelici; quod ita repraesentaverit coram pluribus, nunc percipitur, qua flamma visa illico persuadentur quod sint angeli, forte ita apud eos. Praeter alia similia quae magica sunt. Inter artes eorum quoque est, quod illico se surripiant e visu aliorum, et inconspicuos se reddant. </p>
