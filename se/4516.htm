<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4516</h4><p>4516. About mental imagery<p>A mental image was called forth against a certain man with whom I had had a boyhood quarrel - an image so vivid, that I could so to speak look right at the person being spoken of, and then call forth his image. This shows what kind of mental imagery is grasped in boyhood, and how much of it remains. For whenever I saw him, I remembered this matter, supposing that he wished to pursue me, but only incognito, as he lived a moral life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4516</h4><p>4516. CONCERNING IDEAS.<p>There was called forth against a certain one, with whom I had a childish quarrel, an idea so vivid that I, as it were, actually saw the person to whom I allude, and then the idea was [still more clearly] called forth. Hence it may appear of what quality are the ideas taken up in childhood, and how completely they remain; for as often as I saw him I recollected that circumstance, supposing that he was disposed to persecute me, though in some covert manner, as he is in the moral of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4516 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4516. De ideis<p>Evocabatur idea contra quendam, cum quo rixa puerilis, tam viva, ut quasi eum conspicere, de quo loquuti, et tunc evocabatur idea, inde constare potest quales ideae sunt in pueritia captae, et quantum remanent, nam quoties eum vidi, recordatus sum istius rei, putans quod me persequi vellet, sed modo incognito, quia est in morata vita. </p>
