<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4317</h4><p>4317. About the heartbeat<p>It was granted me to feel the pulsation of the heart of heaven, in general. It was grand, somewhat slower than mine, attended with a rather deep sound, and I was told that I was now in the heartbeat of heaven. Then I saw that I was among little children. This was located in the middle of the chest. Later I was given to feel the heartbeat of the heaven of angelic spirits, which was above the navel toward the front; its vibrations were more rapid. 1749, 2 July. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Saturn, meaning Saturday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4317</h4><p>4317. CONCERNING THE PULSATION OF THE HEART.<p>It was given me to perceive the pulsation of the heart of heaven in general. It was heavy, somewhat slower than mine, and attended with rather a deep sound. It was said that I was then in the pulsation of the heart of heaven, and I perceived that I was among infants. This pulsation was in the midst of the heart. It was afterwards given to perceive the pulsation of the heart of the heaven of angelic spirits, which was anterior above the navel; the vibrations were more rapid. - 1749, July 2. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4317 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4317. De pulsu cordis<p>Sentire datum pulsationem cordis coeli, in communi, erat grandis, aliquantum lentior meo, cum sonitu satis alto, et dictum mihi quod essem tunc in pulsatione cordis coeli, tunc percipiebam quod inter infantes essem; hoc erat in medio pectore; postea dabatur sentire pulsationem cordis coeli spirituum angelicorum, quae erat supra umbilicum anterius, vibrationes erant celeriores. 1749, 2 Julius. </p>
