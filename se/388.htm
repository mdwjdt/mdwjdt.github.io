<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>388.那些只想拥有世俗之物，从而排斥其他所有人的人，最终从天堂被扔出去。因为这种人渴望拥有地上和世上的一切，与自己相比仇恨他人，蔑视他们，仿佛他们应被视为街上的烂泥；有一种不祥的命运在等着他们。一开始，他们觉得自己似乎住在天堂的最高处；事实上觉得自己正像其他人那样享受着至高的快乐。于是，他们把所有人都看得无足轻重，远在他们脚底之下的深处。但同样的命运等待着他们，也就是说，他们被扔下去，成了最低等的人；被降至他们因着仇恨而将他人所搁置的那个层次：因为对所有人的爱是属天堂、属神的。（1747年12月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 388</h4><p>388. They who want to have worldly possessions for themselves alone, and to keep them away from everyone else, are eventually thrown out of heaven<p>The kind of people who long to possess everything on earth and in the world, hating others in comparison with themselves and scorning them as if they should be regarded as the dirt of the streets, have an unfavorable lot awaiting them. At first, they seem to themselves to be living in the highest places of heaven, and in fact, to be enjoying the highest pleasure, like the rest. So they look down upon all as of no account, deep beneath their feet; but the lot awaiting them is just that, namely, that they are cast down and become the lowest, and are degraded to the very level at which they by their hatred had held others. For a love for all is heavenly and Divine. 1747, the 24th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 388</h4><p>388. THOSE WHO ALONE WISH TO POSSESS WORLDLY THINGS, AND THEREBY TO EXCLUDE ALL OTHERS, ARE AT LENGTH REJECTED FROM HEAVEN <p>For those who are such that they desire to possess all things on the earth and in the world, and hate others in comparison with themselves, and condemn them as those who should be accounted as the mire of the streets, there remains a contrary lot. At first they seem to themselves to dwell in the highest places of heaven, and indeed, to enjoy, like others, the highest degree of pleasure; so they look down upon all as of no account far beneath their feet. But a like lot awaits them, namely, they are cast down and become the lowest; and they are brought low to the same degree as they had held others in hatred: for the love of all is heavenly and Divine. 1747, Dec. 24. </p>

Qui soli volunt possidere mundana, et omnes reliquos inde excludere, ii tandem e coelo rejiciuntur<p>Qui tales sunt, ut omnia possidere cupiant in terra et in mundo, et alios prae se odio habent, ac eos condemnant tanquam tales qui <sup>1</sup></p><p>reputandi ut lutum platearum, eorum sors manet contraria, in altissimis locis coeli videntur sibi habitare, et quidem sicut caeteri, principio, summa voluptate frui, sic despectant tanquam nauci omnes <sup>2</sup></p><p>sub pedibus suis profundi, sed eorum sors similis manet, nempe quod dejiciantur ac infimi fiant, ac abjecti in simili gradu sicut odio habuerunt reliquos; nam amor omnium est coelestis et divinus. 1747, die 24 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
