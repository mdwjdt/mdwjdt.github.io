<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6010</h4><p>6010. About the love of commanding<p>What inexpressible enjoyment and so to speak sweetness is present in the love of commanding has become known to me from much experience. In the case of C[harles] XII <sup>1</sup>, when he was married, there were fights between him and his wife over the power to command. And I was told then that they called the enjoyment of this love their heaven, but it is hell.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For information on this person see footnote to passage <a href="4704.htm">4704</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6010</h4><p>6010. THE LOVE OF RULING. <p>It has been made known to me, by much experience, that an inexpressible pleasantness, and as it were sweetness, dwells in the love of ruling. In the case of Charles XII., when he was married, there was a struggle between him and his wife respecting the power of ruling; and I was then told that they called the delightfulness of that love their heaven; when, nevertheless, hell is in it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6010 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6010. De amore imperandi<p>Quod ineffabilis jucunditas et quasi dulcedo insit amori imperandi, a multa experientia mihi notum factum est; in C. XII, quum ille maritatus, erat pugna inter eum et mulierem ejus de potestate imperandi, et tunc dictum mihi quod vocarent jucundum illius amoris suum coelum; cum tamen in eo est infernum. </p>
