<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1484</h4><p>1484. Some spirits are indignant when told that they are absolutely not the only ones who speak, but that there are many<p>It never happens that any spirit is so alone that he is not in some group of spirits who are speaking at the same time. And yet spirits imagine that they are alone and speaking on their own. When they are told this, they are usually offended, but it has been made clear to them very often by the actual experience that those in the group affirmed the fact, then left the spirit alone to some extent. 1748, 17 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1484</h4><p>1484. CERTAIN SPIRITS ARE INDIGNANT WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM THAT THEY ARE NEVER ALONE, BUT THOSE WHO SPEAK ARE MANY <p>It is never granted any spirit to be alone to the extent that he is not in some association of spirits who speak together, although the spirits suppose that they are alone and speak from themselves. When they are told this, they are usually indignant, but it is very often made manifest to them by living experience, and those who are in the society of a spirit have affirmed this. Then they have partly left him alone. 1748, Mar. 17. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1484 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1484. Indignantur quidam spiritus, quum iis dicitur, quod soli nusquam sint, sed plures qui loquuntur<p>1484. Nusquam datur quod spiritus aliquis, ita solus sit, quin in quodam consortio spirituum, qui simul loquuntur; et tamen putant spiritus, quod soli sint, et ex se loquantur, quod cum iis dicitur, indignari solent, sed iis saepissime hoc manifestum factum est per [eam] experientiam vivam, quod ii qui in societate affirmarint, tum reliquerint eum, quoad partem. 1748, 17 Martius. </p>
