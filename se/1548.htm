<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1548</h4><p>1548. Any among them who begin to harbor wrong thoughts, from them they dissociate themselves. They cannot remain in their society, but are all alone, in rocky places and elsewhere, and they no longer concern themselves with them.<p>However, there are some societies which coax and compel such a person by different methods, but still it is a kind of dissociation. And because they have not put their conversion to test, they do not want to declare whether those who have once fallen remain so. They only say they do not have any hope of their repentance, not knowing of any examples. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1548</h4><p>1548. (Those among them who begin to cherish sinister thought thereby dissociate themselves from the rest, who are unable to remain in their society; consequently they are left to abide alone in rocky caverns, uncared for by their former companions. There are, however, certain societies which endeavor by various persuasives to work upon such persons and compel them [to return to a better state of mind], but still it is a species of dissociation; and so long as they do not become satisfied as to their conversion, or whether having once lapsed they will so remain, they do not openly speak of their condition. The sole reason of this is because they have not a confirmed hope of their repentance, of which they have no assurance from their actual conduct.) </p>
