<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1396</h4><p>1396. About those at the right bank of the swamp who try to kill each other with various tools [<a href="1383.htm">1383</a>]<p>Some of them came to me from there, saying that they are continually killing each other, saying that they had been the kind in life who harbored the deepest hatred against their neighbor, and whenever opportunities arose, it broke out. From this they got their enjoyments, always loving legal disputes and having their neighbor summoned up for judgment, punishments and fines; in these they take pleasure. If legal punishments did not hold them back, these people would rush upon their neighbor, and try to cut him up and kill him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1396</h4><p>1396. CONCERNING THOSE AT THE RIGHT OF THE LAKE WHO ENDEAVOR TO KILL ONE ANOTHER WITH VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS <p>Certain of them came to me from thence, saying that they are continually killing one another, and that during their life they had been such as had cherished interior hatred against the neighbor, and as often as opportunity was given, they had burst forth, taking delight in so doing. They said that they always loved disputes, and found delight in summoning the neighbor to legal proceedings, to punishments and fines. Unless they had been restrained by the punishments of the law they would likewise have openly rushed upon their neighbor and wounded him, even endeavoring to kill him. </p>
