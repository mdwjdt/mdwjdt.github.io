<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3418</h4><p>3418. Evil spirits, even the worst, cannot arouse those sleeping<p>I have observed that when bad and even the worst spirits and demons were around me, [so bad] that they could attack other spirits even the worst with their mental images, were unable to do so to those sleeping. For while I was awake I noticed sleeping spirits with me, and that although I was then surrounded by such [evil ones], they still could not at all move or arouse those sleeping. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3418</h4><p>3418. THAT EVIL SPIRITS, YEA THE WORST, ARE NOT ABLE TO EXCITE THOSE WHO SLEEP.<p>It was observed when evil spirits and genii were the worst, were around me, so as to be able to excite even subtler spirits by their ideas, that they were unable [to do so to] those who were asleep: for when I was awake, I apperceived near me spirits who were asleep: and though I was then surrounded by such [evil spirits] that still they were not at all able to move or excite the sleepers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3418 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3418. Quod mali spiritus, etiam pessimi, dormientes nequeant excitare<p>Observatum cum mali imo pessimi spiritus et genii circum me essent, adeo ut alios spiritus etiam subtiliores possent ideis suis infestare, quod dormientes nequirent, nam apud me dormientes spiritus, cum vigil essem, appercepi, et cum tunc circumfusus talibus essem, quod usque nihil movere seu excitare possent dormientes. </p>
