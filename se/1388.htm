<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1388</h4><p>1388. He was abandoned by his companions<p>After his face appeared ugly [<a href="1376.htm">1376</a>], denoting what he was like, as the face is the index of the mind-while previously they had thought he possessed a face full of majesty, he was then despised by those he had been with and was abandoned by his companions, and then brought to the right a little overhead, and so to the swamp, down a gentle slope. 1748, 15 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1388</h4><p>1388. THAT THE SAME SPIRIT WAS DESERTED BY HIS COMPANIONS <p>Afterwards his deformed face appeared and thus it was evident that he was of such a character, for the face is the index of the mind. Before this they had supposed that he was favored with a face full of majesty. He was therefore despised by those with whom he had previously been, and was deserted by his companions. Thus he was carried away to the right, a little above the head, and so to the lake, a little downwards, by a slight declivity. <sup>1</sup>1748, Mar. 15. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Apparently one of the apostles. See Index (s.v. Apostoli): "One of them, whose face was deformed about the end of his life, was despised and deserted by his companions, and carried away to the lake; nos. 1388, 1377." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1388 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1388. Quod a consortiis suis relictus sit<p>Postquam facies ejus deformis apparuit [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1388/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1376" target=_top>1376</a>] sic quod talis esset, quia facies est index animi prius putarint, quod facie majestatis plena gauderet, ideo {a} contemtus ab iis, cum quibus prius fuit relictus a consortiis sic perlatus dextrum paulo supra caput sic stagnum, paulo deorsum per paulo declive. 1748, 15 Martius. </p>
