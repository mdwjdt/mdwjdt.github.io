<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2647</h4><p>2647. Finally after 2 or 3 or 4 hours, they declared that they had now fashioned their candlestick, which I could see faintly. It was graceful, with its lamps and flowers. And then I spoke with them and told them that they had neither thought up nor fashioned anything at all from themselves, but that the Lord had fashioned it for them. This they could not at first believe because they were still convinced they had accomplished this by their own effort. But finally when it was portrayed to them by a spiritual mental image that I had observed this to be the case, and that I could therefore corroborate it with certainty, then they admitted they had thought they themselves had brought it all about, but admitted then that the Lord had done all things down to the least details. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2647</h4><p>2647. At length after three or four hours they said that now they have formed their candlestick, which was obscurely seen by me: it was elegant with its lamps and flowers; and then I spoke with them and said that they have never invented anything of themselves, and have not formed [it], but the Lord has formed [it] for them. This they at first could scarcely believe, because they were still in the opinion that they have formed [it] by their exertion, but at length was represented to them in spiritual idea such a principle [thing] as I have appear then acknowledged that they supposed they had effected the whole thing, but finally admitted that the Lord had effected each and all [of those things].) </p>
