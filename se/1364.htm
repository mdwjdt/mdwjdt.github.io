<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1364</h4><p>1364. From this it can be known that everyone is allotted their own province, and that there is unlimited variety, and a harmony among all, as there is among all parts in a human being down to the very least-the whole being composed of a harmony of varieties. And it can also be known that it has been foreseen and provided that all who inherit heaven are parts of this grand human being, and are therefore in the Lord, and that heaven can never be closed, not to all eternity. For the more there are in a society, and the more societies there are, the better, the more blessed, and more strengthened heaven is. 1748, 14 March. </p>

Also, that heaven can never be closed even to eternity, for the more there are in a society, and the more societies there are, so much the better, the more blessed, and the stronger they are. 1748, Mar. 14. </p>
