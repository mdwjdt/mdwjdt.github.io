<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2545</h4><p>2545. To elucidate this for them I was inspired to say that since the experience is clear and sure, there should be no doubting just because the appearance is otherwise and they do not know the causes. There are very many like cases in nature proved by experience and, being true [contrary to the appearance], must nevertheless be believed. For example, the fact that they can sail around the globe and on the opposite side stand antipodal to our feet - this is something certain, because experience has shown it. Who in the world would doubt it simply because it appears otherwise and because they do not know the cause? Why, there must be numberless similar cases in the universe that they would not believe, when yet they are so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2545</h4><p>2545. It was granted to elucidate this before them, [and] to say that when experience is clear and certain, there should be no doubt, because the appearance is other, and because they do not know causes; in like manner very many similar things are given in nature which are evident from experience, and nevertheless because true it is to be believed; for instance, that they can sail around the globe [globo telluris], and from the opposite part from [a point] opposite our feet. This is certain, because experience shows it. Should anyone in the world doubt concerning it, because it appeared otherwise, and because he did not know the cause, then there would be innumerable similar things in the nature of things which he would not believe when yet they are such.) </p>
