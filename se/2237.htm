<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2237</h4><p>2237. In the world of spirits, they stir one another up almost as people on earth do<p>When it is permitted one spirit and his partners to think anything evil or filthy, I have noticed that at once others of the same ilk are stirred up to whatever malice or filth it is. As a result also, souls and spirits expose what they are like, for on coming into a state without reflecting where they are, as if left to themselves, then they are at once aroused to such things and are recognized immediately for where they are, and what they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2237</h4><p>2237. IN THE WORLD OF SPIRITS THAT THEY ARE EXCITED ONE BY ANOTHER, ALMOST LIKE AS ONE MAN IS BY ANOTHER. <p>It was observed, when it was permitted one [a single] spirit and his company to plot [cogitare] any evil or baseness [spurci], that forthwith others, who are of like family, are excited to whatsoever malice or baseness it may be. In this way, also, are souls and spirits disclosed as to their quality; for when in a state without reflection, wherein they are, as it were, left to themselves alone, then are they straightway excited to like things, and are known as to what place they are in, and of what quality they are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2237 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2237. In mundo spirituum, quod excitentur unus ab altero, paene sicut unus homo ab altero<p>Observatum est, quum permitteretur uni spiritui ac ejus consortibus, aliquid mali aut spurci cogitare, quod illico alii qui similis prosapiae sunt, excitentur, ad quaecunque malitia aut spurcities sit, inde quoque deteguntur animae, et spiritus quales sunt, nam, cum in statu absque reflexione ubi sunt, sicut sibi solis relicti essent, tunc illico ad similia excitantur, et illico noscuntur ubi sunt, et quales sunt. </p>
