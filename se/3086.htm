With what a burning desire those who are led by the Lord [are loved] to serve even the worst, even enemies<p>There were some from among the worst from Gehenna who were attacking me throughout the night, trying to kill me by criminal arts, so that I twice awoke from sleep and saw and felt their attempts and actions. Finally when morning dawned, some whom I knew were inflamed with a burning desire to instruct them and deal well with them. I was given the knowledge that they were being guided by the Lord. Those in Gehenna confessed this also. <sup>1</sup>1748, 7 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The latter portion of 3086 is emphasized marginally by the sign NB. </p>

WHAT ARDENT DESIRE THEY WHO ARE LED BY THE LORD HAVE TO SERVE EVEN THE WORST, ALTHOUGH [THEIR] ENEMIES. <p>[These good spirits] were among [spirits] of the worser sort from Gehenna, who infested me the whole night and endeavored to kill me by criminal [flagitious] arts, so that I was twice aroused from sleep, and saw and felt their attempts and acts; at length, when morning came these [good spirits], who were known to me, burned with ardent desire. - N.B. to instruct them, and do them good; for I perceived what was granted me to know, that they were led by the Lord. So also did these acknowledge who are in [penes] Gehenna. - 1748, September 7. </p>
