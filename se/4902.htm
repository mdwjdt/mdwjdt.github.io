<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4902</h4><p>4902. Continuation about the dragon and his gang and about the fall of spirits from the heavens<p>For several days spirits who formed the gang of the dragon fell from the heavens and were thrown down into hell. Among them were also very many who believed that there is salvation through doctrinal faith, in fact, simply through the knowledge of doctrines, and who cared nothing at all about the way one lives. They spent their lives in their evils of self-love and love of the world, in wickedness, cunning deceits, and also in adulteries. </p>
