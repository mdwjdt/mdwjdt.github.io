<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5420</h4><p>5420. After this, various places were looked into and it was found that using this doctrine they made shining things appear in the air, and in rooms, they did miracles, many of them. In the case of a certain one, as a result of this doctrine, all the books vanished; and other things happened elsewhere. The fact that this doctrine gave off light was due to the Divine truths in it, for Divine truth is what produces light in the other life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5420</h4><p>5420. After this, inquiry was instituted in various places, and it was found that, by means of that doctrine, they produced shining appearances in the air and in chambers - thus miracles - which were very numerous. With a certain one, all his books, through that doctrine [thus abused], fled away; and other things happened elsewhere. That that doctrine shone, was from the Divine truths in it; for Divine truth is what gives light in the other life. </p>

Postea inquisitum variis in locis, ac inventum quod per doctrinam illam apparentias lucidas fecerint in aere, in cameris, ita miracula, quae plura sunt; apud quendam ex doctrina illa omnes libri aufugiebant; et aliter alibi. Quod doctrina illa luceret, erat ex veris Divinis inibi, verum enim Divinum est quod lucet in altera vita. </p>
