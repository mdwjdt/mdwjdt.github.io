<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5233</h4><p>5233. It must be known that those in the mountains to the south were those who were most intensely in the light of nature. By this they confirmed their disbelief in the Divine and at the same time affirmed their trust in what is man's own. They who were to the north had been in nature's light dimly and nonetheless thought in the same way. Those to the east were those who had been deeply steeped in the delight of exercising control and also in the natural light from this, and who had done the same. Those in the west were like this, in dim light.</p><p>[2] All in the other life are distinguished in this way, according to the state of light or understanding, and according to the state of love or will; thus they appear divided into four regions. Consequently they were carried away sequentially according to their state: first those in the southern regions, then those in the northern, those in the eastern and last those in the western. But those in the east were taken through the north to the west and by this route into that infernal chasm. I saw the successive stages of this progression. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5233</h4><p>5233. It should be known that they who were in the mountains at the south, were such as were, to the greatest degree, in the light of nature, whereby they confirmed themselves against the Divine and in favor of the proprium of man. Those who were in the north, were in the light of nature obscurely, and yet thought in like manner. Those who were at the east, were such as were in the delight of governing in the greatest degree, and also thence in natural light; and they did similarly. Those who were in the west, had been in such [delight] to a less degree. Thus are all distinguished in the other life. They appear thus placed apart in different regions, according to the state of light, or of understanding, and according to the state of love, or of the will. Hence, they were borne away, in succession, according to their state: first, those for the south; afterwards, those for the north; next, those for the east; and, lastly, those for the west. But those who were in the east were taken by way of the north, to the west, and so, to that infernal chasm. I saw the order of the progression. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5233 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5233. Sciendum quod qui in montibus ad meridiem erant, essent qui in maximo lumine naturae, per quod confirmabant se contra Divinum, et cum proprio hominis; qui ad septentrionem quod fuerint qui in obscuro lumine naturae, et simile usque cogitarunt; qui ad orientem, fuerunt qui in maximo jucundo imperandi fuerunt, et quoque in lumine inde naturali, et simile fecerunt; qui in occidente qui in tali obscuro; ita distinguuntur omnes in altera vita, ac secundum status, luminis seu intellectus, et secundum status amoris seu voluntatis ita apparent separati ad plagas; inde ferebantur ordine secundum status primum meridionales, dein septentrionales, tum orientales et ultimum occidentales, sed qui in oriente ferebantur per septentrionale ad occidentale et sic in hiatum illum infernalem; ordo progressionis visus. </p>
