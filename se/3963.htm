<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3963</h4><p>3963. What kind of spirits were with me<p>It was as if the spirits with me were in the world, which was not the case when they were with other people. For with me they have been not only like earthlings as to their inclinations and memory, but also as to their senses, so that they imagined themselves to be entirely as if in the world, or to have returned into the world. They were able to lead me, to see through my eyes, to hear through my ears others speaking - even, if it was permitted, to speak with them in their own language, to write to them in their own style - but it was not permitted them to touch others by my hands,<p>With other it was different, for the state with me was so altered by the Lord that I could be possessed by spirits and yet they could do me no harm at all, as when others are obsessed and then lost their minds, whereas I was entirely myself as before, mixing socially as before, for the space of several years, with no noticeable difference. So one who has faith, is able to be in this state of mind, and by no means any others, for they would perish instantly.<p>The world at this day is such that those possessed run the risk of losing their life - such inward hatred today prevails. 1748, 13 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3963</h4><p>3963. OF THE QUALITY OF THOSE WHO WERE WITH ME.<p>Unlike what happens in regard to other men, spirits have been with me as they were in the world, for with me they have been not only as men as to their mind and memory, but also as to sense, so that they would even suppose themselves to be, as it were, in the world, or to have returned into the world. They were able to lead me, to see through my eyes, to hear, through my ears, others speaking, yea, [they could have heard] others speaking with themselves if it had been lawful for them to speak with them in their own speech, or to write to them in their own style but these things were not permitted, neither to touch others through my hands. With other persons the case is different, for my state is so ordered by the Lord, that I can be possessed by spirits, and yet without injury, in which my case is altogether different from that of others when possessed, inasmuch as they are rendered thereby non compos, while I remain altogether in my right mind. Indeed, from the very first of my enjoying this interaction [with spirits] onward through the space of several years, I have been as I was before without the slightest observable difference. This privilege, therefore, can pertain [safely] to him only who is in faith; by no means to any others, as they would immediately perish. Such is the state of the world at this day, that whoever is possessed incurs the peril of his life, so intense is the internal hatred that now reigns. - 1748, November 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3963 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3963. Quales apud me<p>Spiritus apud me fuerunt sicut essent in mundo, non sicut apud alios homines, nam apud me, non solum fuerunt sicut homines quoad ejus animum et memoriam, sed etiam quoad sensum, ut nempe putarent se prorsus quasi in mundo esse, seu rediisse in mundum, potuerunt me ducere, per oculos meos videre, audire alios loquentes per aures meas, imo cum iis, si permissum foret, sua loquela cum iis loqui, suo stylo ad eos scribere, sed hoc non permissum, per manus meas tangere alios; aliter apud alios; nam status a Domino ita apud me factus, ut possessus potuerim esse a spiritibus, et usque nihil nocerent, sicut cum alii, qui obsessi, qui tunc non sui compotes fuere; cum ego prorsus mihi similis, ac prius, interfuerim consortio ut prius, ne minima observata differentia, per aliquot annos talis; quare qui in fide est, is talis esse potest, alii nequaquam, nam illico perirent; talis est mundus hodie, ut dum possessus est, incurrit illico discrimen vitae; odium tale interius, hodie regnat. 1748, 13 Nov. </p>
