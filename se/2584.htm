<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2584</h4><p>2584. Those who lived 1000, or 4000 years ago, when restored to their state while in the life of the body are entirely like themselves<p>By much experience I have been enabled to learn that those who had lived 1700, 2000, 3000, up to 4000 years ago, such as at the time of the Lord, and 1000, 2000 years before His time, when restored to the state of their former life, are entirely like themselves, so that nothing at all is lacking or lost. They are also the same in attitude, customs, in fact in all of the life they had had in the world, even their walk, for I have been allowed to speak with them at length and often, for months, and years, so that I would know for sure that they were the same. Hence it may be known that people lose nothing of what they had in the life of the body except for the body alone and such things as are entirely proper to the body. But when they are restored to their heavenly state, it is different, and then they are unaware of any of those properties that are merely corporeal. 1748, 10 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2584</h4><p>2584. THAT THEY WHO HAVE LIVED ONE THOUSAND OR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE, ARE ENTIRELY SIMILAR TO THEMSELVES WHEN RESTORED TO THAT STATE WHICH WAS THEIRS IN THE LIFE OF THE BODY [dum in statu suo, in vita corporis]. <p>It is granted me to know, from much experience, that they who have lived 1700, 2000, 3000 to 4000 years before, as in the time of the Lord, and 1000 [and] 2000 years before his time, when they are restored to the state of [their] former life are quite similar to themselves, so that nothing at all is wanting, or is missing, as well also as regards the mind, manners, yea, all the life which they had possessed in the world, [also] as regards the gait [gressum], for it was given to converse with them very long, and at many times, during [for] months and years, so that I knew for certain that they were the same. Hence may be known that man loses nothing of those things which he possessed in the life of the body except the body alone, and such as are entirely proper [propria] to the body. But when they are remitted into the heavenly state, then it is different with them, and then they are ignorant of those things which are merely corporeal. - 1748, July 10. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2584 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2584. Quod ii qui vixerunt ante 1000, vel 4000 annos, dum [restituuntur] in statum suum in vita corporis, prorsus sibi similes sunt<p>Ex pluri experientia mihi scire datum, quod ii qui vixerunt ante 1700, 2000, 3000, ad 4000 annos, sicut tempore Domini, et ante tempus Ipsius 1000, 2000 annis, quod dum restituuntur in statum vitae prioris, prorsus sibi similes sint, sic ut nihil prorsus desit, vel amissum, tum quoad animum, mores, imo vitam omnem quam habuerant in mundo, quoad gressum, nam cum iis loqui quam diu et multoties datum est, per menses <sup>1</sup></p><p>, et annos, ut pro certo scirem, quod iidem essent; exinde sciri potest, quod homo nihil amittat ab iis quae habuit in vita corporis, praeter solum corpus, et quae prorsus propria corporis sunt. At vero dum in statum coelestem remittuntur, tunc aliter se habent, et tunc nesciunt ea, quae mere corporea sunt. 1748, 10 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
