<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3246</h4><p>3246. About a beautiful bird<p>Something of a flaming purple color was observed that was variegated by a reddening and a bright whiteness, which I saw before my face at a distance. And then I saw a hand to which this beautiful flamy something was clinging, at first to the back side of the hand, then to its palm, by which it held this flamy thing. This lasted for a little while, and I was thinking it was something flamy seen by the spirits just now spoken of, on their earth. The flamy thing was licking the hand all over, then the hand squeezed it in its hollow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3246</h4><p>3246. CONCERNING A BEAUTIFUL BIRD.<p>(There was beheld a sort of flamy principle, purple, variously red, with white. I saw this before my face, at a distance, and next [was seen] a band, to which this beautiful flamy [thing] adhered, first, to the back part of the band, then in the palm, by which be had held this flamy [something]. This lasted a short time. I supposed that it was a sort of flamy [principle] seen in their earth, by the spirits, of whom [I have] now [been writing]. The flamy principle licked his hand round about, and then was compressed into the hollow of the hand. [vala]. </p>

De pulchra ave<p>Spectabatur flammeum quoddam purpureum, rubescens varium, cum candido, quod ante faciem ad distantiam videbam, et mox manus cui hoc flammeum pulchrum adhaesit primum ad inversam partem manus, tum in palma, qua tenebat flammeum hoc, quod aliquantisper perstitit, [ego] putans quod esset aliquod flammeum visum spiritibus de quibus nunc, in tellure eorum, lambebat flammeum manum ejus circumcirca, tum etiam comprimebat [id] vola. </p>
