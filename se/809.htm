<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 809</h4><p>809. These people in the other life are apparently compatible with many [groups], for they do almost nothing else but promote what I may call harmonious movements of spirits. They can almost be called lubricants, because they facilitate [these movements], especially where some passion has not become deeply rooted.<p>Among these there are both demons and spirits, as well as intermediate types. Thus they are as it were mixers, which struck me as being connectors; but they are mixers, for promoting the flowing movements of spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 809</h4><p>809. Such in the other life seem to be able to associate with many, for they scarcely do anything else than promote agreements, so that I may say they are the fluctions of spirits. They may be called lubricants, as it were, for they facilitate associations, especially when some cupidity has not become deeply rooted. Of them there are both genii and spirits, and also those who are intermediate. Thus they are like insertions; to me they came as connectives, but they are insertions for promoting spiritual fluctions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 809 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>809. Tales in altera vita videntur associabiles esse pluribus, nam fere nihil aliud faciunt, quam promovent concordes ut ita dicam, spirituum fluxiones, vocari quasi possunt unguenta, quia facilitant, cumprimis quando <sup>1</sup></p><p>cupiditas aliqua non radicem alte fixerit: dantur eorum tam genii quam spiritus, ut et intermedii. Ita sunt quasi insertiones: mihi obvenerunt sicut connexiones, sed sunt insertiones ad promovendas fluxiones <sup>2</sup></p><p>spirituales.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quado<p>2.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
