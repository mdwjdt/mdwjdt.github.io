<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6106</h4><p>6106. [numbered by Tr.] About marriage<p>A woman was with me on several occasions who said and believed that it is impossible to love one's married partner for long, since [intercourse] becomes ordinary and is continually allowed. But she received the reply that in heaven, where there are no adulteries, because they are abominated, what is ordinary becomes pleasurable, and that they love their partner because [intercourse] is always permitted and because at these moments a heavenly pleasure penetrates them.</p><p>[2] Adulterers know that a feeling of ordinariness [of having intercourse] with one's wife develops; therefore, so that this feeling of ordinariness can be taken away and there can be the lascivious feeling of adultery, they want their wife to refuse, or more, deny that she loves it, and be reluctant, and then from being ordinary it becomes like the lascivious pleasure of adultery; yes, certain ones who love raping and so the virgin state, want wives to fight against their husbands, run away; and also that husbands violently force her and tear her dress, while she is refusing.<p>They can be compared to cats. The females, fighting back in this fashion, cry out, run away; by this the male cat's sexual power is aroused, and then the female cat gives herself as captive.</p><p>[3] I put a question to spirits newly arrived from the world who did not regard adultery as a sin and all of whom nevertheless, when they came into the world of spirits, wanted to come into heaven. I said that it is allowable to go whoring and commit adultery in hell, but not in heaven; in heaven you are allowed to love only your partner and live with her to eternity and never reject her. Would it be more agreeable to be in heaven than in hell? I asked more than a hundred such and never received a reply from one.</p><p>[4] About the condition of those in the hells who are under judges. In a separate room behind the males are females who had been [someone's woman]. They are permitted to join themselves with one of these women, and then the man is permitted to have her as his woman, but it is not permitted to do so with others and thus to go whoring promiscuously.</p><p>[5] There are hells full of whores that novitiate spirits go into and enjoy whoring to the full. They pay the punishments of various foul diseases there and so stop.</p><p>[6] There are filthy societies there where whores and adulterers gather; there are groups where the whores choose males every night and gatherings where males choose whores for themselves. The whores there can make themselves beautiful with fantasies.</p><p>[7] The whores who are gifted with ingenuity are called sirens. They appear like mice; there are larger and smaller ones there; what they were like was described. Such women are set over them as keep them obedient and compel them to work.</p><p>[8] These flee from cats, just as mice and dormice do. Who they are who are cats. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6106</h4><p>6106. MARRIAGE. <p>On several occasions, there was with me a woman who said, and believed, that it is impossible to love one's married partner for long, for the reason that it becomes a usual thing, and is constantly permitted; but she received answer that, in heaven, where there are no adulteries - for they are abominated - that very usualness becomes delightful, and that they love the married partner because it is always permitted, and because the deliciousness of heaven enters at such times. <p>That such a feeling of ordinariness towards a wife takes place is known to adulterers; wherefore, in order that that sense of ordinariness may be removed, and the lasciviousness of adultery occur, they wish the wife to refuse, indeed, to deny that she likes it, and to resist; and then, out of the ordinariness there arises, as it were the lasciviousness of adultery. Indeed, some who have pleasure in rapes, and consequently in an unlawful state, wish that [the wives] should fight against the husbands, and run away, and that the husband should violently force her, and tear her dress, she still resisting. The women, in such a case, may be compared to cats, which thus fight, scream out, and run away; whereby potency is excited in the male cat, and then the female cat yields herself captive. <p>I made inquiries of spirits newly arrived from the world, who did not regard lasciviousness as sin - all of whom, nevertheless, when they enter the world of spirits, desire to go to heaven - and said that in hell it is allowed to commit whoredom and adultery, but it is not allowed in heaven, but only to love the married partner, and live with her to eternity, and never to put her away. I asked whether they would more willingly be in heaven or in hell. I asked over a hundred, and never received a reply from one of such a quality. <p>As respects the state of those who are in hells, under judges, it is, that, in a separate chamber, behind the males, are some who had been women. It was permitted to the men to conjoin to themselves anyone of these, and have her for their woman; but it was not permitted to do so with any others of them there, thus to commit promiscuous whoredom. <p>There exist hells filled with harlots, into which newcomers enter, and commit whoredom to satiety. They are punished by various filthy diseases there; and on that account they refrain. <p>There are infamous societies there, where harlots and adulterers resort. There are gatherings where harlots, every night, choose themselves males: they are not gatherings where males choose themselves harlots. The harlots there are able, by means of phantasies, to render themselves beautiful. <p>Harlots who excel in ingenuity are called sirens; they appear like mice. There are the larger kinds, <sup>1</sup>there, and the smaller kinds there. Wherefore, such females are set over them as hold them in obedience, and compel them to labor. <p>These fly from cats, like mice and dormice. Some, there, are cats. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The "larger kinds" are probably rats, which the ancient Latin writers designate by the same word as "mice," viz., mus. -TR. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6106 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6106 [.] De conjugio<p>Erat mulier apud me aliquoties, quae dixit et credidit, quod impossibile sit diu amare conjugem, ex causa quia fit commune, et jugiter licitum, at responsum tulit, quod in coelo ubi non sunt adulteria, quia abominantur illa, illud commune fit delitiosum, et quod ament conjugem quia semper licet, et quia tunc intrat delitiosum coeli.<p>[2] Quod tale commune erga uxorem fiat adulteris notum est, quare ut commune illud tollatur, et fiat lascivum adulterii, volunt ut uxor renuat, imo neget quod id amet, et tergiversetur, et tunc ex communi fit sicut lascivum adulterii; imo quidam qui violationes amant, et sic illibatum statum, volunt ut pugnent contra maritos, aufugiant, et quod maritus violentur adigant, et lacerent togam, illa renuente, illi comparari possunt felibus, quae ita repugnant, clamant, aufugiunt, per quae excitatur feli masculo potentia, et tunc felis faemina dat se captivam.<p>[3] Quaesivi advenas e mundo spiritus, qui lasciva reputabant non peccata, qui tamen omnes dum veniunt in mundum spirituum volunt venire in coelum, dixi, quod licitum sit scortari et adulterari in inferno, at non liceat in coelo, sed solum amare conjugem et cum illa vivere in aeternum, et nusquam abdicare, num velint in coelo an in inferno libentius esse, quaesivi ultra centum, et nusquam retuli a quodam tali responsum.<p>[4] De statu illorum qui in infernis sunt sub judicibus, quod in camera separata post mares sint faeminae quae fuerant, ex his licet illis adjungere sibi aliquam, et pro sua muliere habere, sed non licet cum aliis ibi, ita promiscue scortari.<p>[5] Quod dentur inferna plena scortis, in quae novitii veniunt, et scortantur ad satietatem, poenas luunt ex variis morbis tetris ibi, ideo desistunt.<p>[6] Quod sint ibi societates turpes, ubi conveniunt scorta et adulteri, coetus sunt ubi scorta quavis nocte sibi eligunt mares, et coetus sunt ubi mares sibi eligunt scorta, scorta ibi possunt per phantasias se facere pulchras.<p>[7] Scorta quae ingenio pollent, vocantur sirenes, apparent sicut mures; majores ubi [sunt], et minoes ubi, [tum] quales, [dicatur;] praeficiuntur illis tales quae illas in obedientia tenent, et adigunt ad laborandum.<p>[8] Hi feles fugiunt, sicut mures et glires, quinam sunt feles ibi. </p>
