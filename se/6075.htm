<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6075</h4><p>6075. About merit in good works<p>Good works are done with merit in mind, and without merit in mind, which can be illustrated by this: There is the person who functions in office and performs his office for the sake of merit, that is, to be praised, so for the sake of his reputation, respect, and subsequent promotion, or for the sake of money, if however he can have these things without performing his office he does not perform it. But on the other hand there is the person who does not place merit in it but who does it on account of duty, that it being a duty of his office. In this lies a fear of God, and also a love for the common good.</p><p>[2] In the prior however there is a love of self and the world. Take also a craftsman for example. He does his job from it being a matter of his religion to do so, and for this reason it is his duty, it is his purpose. But another does it only for the sake of being complemented and being given preference, solely for the sake of gain. The latter places merit in it, but the former does not. The first mentioned craftsmen likewise acquire a reputation, respect, and money, but for them these are accessories from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6075</h4><p>6075. MERIT IN GOOD WORKS. <p>Good works take place with merit, and they take place without merit, as may be illustrated by the person who holds an office, and who performs his duty for the sake of merit: it is in order to obtain applause, thus for the sake of reputation, and honor and future promotion, or for the sake of gain; but, if he can have these things without the performance of his duty, he does so. But he who does not place merit in it, does it on account his obligation, because it belongs to his office. In this lies concealed the fear of God, and also love of the community but in the former is the love of self and the world. Also take as an example, a workman. One does his work because it is of his religion, and hence because he is under obligation, to do it: this is his end; but another does it merely to obtain applause and to be better thought of, solely that he may profit thereby. The latter places merit therein, the former not. The former, like the other, accepts any fame, honor and profit but to such ones these things are additions from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6075 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6075. De merito in bonis operibus<p>Fiunt bona opera cum merito et fiunt absque merito, quod illustrari potest per hoc, qui fungitur officio, et qui facit officium suum propter meritum, est ut laudetur, sic propter famam et honorem et postea promotionem, vel propter lucrum, si autem potest habere illa absque officii sui exercitio, facit, at qui non ponit meritum in eo facit propter debitum, quod sit ejus officii, in hoc latet timor Dei, et quoque amor communis, in priori autem est amor sui et mundi. Sit etiam operans exemplo, is facit suum laborem ex eo quod sit ejus religionis, et inde quod sit ejus debiti, hic finis, at alter facit ut modo laudetur, et praeferatur, solum ut lucretur, hic ponit meritum in eo, prior non, priores etiam accipiunt aeque famam, honorem et lucrum, sed haec sunt illis accessoria a Domino. </p>
