<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2103</h4><p>2103. Societies consist mainly of those who are of one kind having its own species<p>That spiritual and angelic societies consist of those who are of one kind, having its own species, is clear from their likeness of affection. For in the world, like persons associate as if of their own will, but in the world of spirits and in heaven, this happens by arrangement of the Lord. And because societies there are not put together as they are on earth, out of necessity, and having a deficiency of people who are alike, therefore those [angels and spirits] who are alike as to feelings and convictions are associated by arrangement of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2103</h4><p>2103. THAT SOCIETIES ARE ESPECIALLY CONSTITUTED OF SUCH AS ARE OF ONE GENUS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR SPECIES. <p>That societies spiritual and angelic are constituted of such as are of one genus with their species is evident from the affection of similarities: for likes are associated in the world, as it were, spontaneously; in the world of spirits and in heaven it occurs by the Lord's ordering, and because societies are not conjoined from necessity, and the want of similars, as is the case in the earth, therefore are associated by the Lord such as are alike as to affections and intellectual persuasions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2103 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2103. Quod societates imprimis constent ex iis qui sunt unius generis, cum suis speciebus<p>Quod societates spirituales et angelicae constent ex iis, qui sunt unius generis, cum suis speciebus, constare potest ex affectione similitudinum, nam similes in mundo quasi sponte associantur, in mundo spirituum et in coelo fit ordinante Domino, et quia societates non ex necessitate et defectu similium conjunguntur, sicut in terra, ideo associantur ii ordinante Domino qui sunt similes quoad affectiones, et persuasiones intellectuales. </p>
