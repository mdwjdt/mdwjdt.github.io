<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2203</h4><p>2203. When spirits show themselves, they generally vary their facial expressions, yet retaining their own face<p>It has already been demonstrated to me clearly that when spirits presented themselves whose faces I was able to see as clearly as a person on earth sees the face of another person- which happened quite often - they sometimes varied their facial expressions by changes from one side to the other. But still they retained the same face in general, always radiating the same dominant affection, with its variations. So there was, so to speak, the face of that specific affection as a whole, together with is variations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2203</h4><p>2203. THAT SPIRITS WHEN THEY MANIFEST THEMSELVES ARE WONT TO VARY THEIR FACES; NEVERTHELESS STILL TO RETAIN THEIR OWN. <p>(It has already been plainly shown me that when spirits manifested themselves, whose faces I had been able to see as plainly as man sees man, and this more frequently, they sometimes varied their faces by changes [mutations] from one limit to the other; but still the same generic face was retained, so that continually shone forth the dominant affection with its variations. Thus they were, as it were, faces of the whole affection of that species, with its variations. </p>

Quod spiritus, dum se manifestant, soleant facies suas variare, usque tamen retinere suam<p>Prius mihi ostensum est manifeste, quod spiritus cum se manifestarent, quorum facies tam manifeste videre poteram, sicut homo hominem, et hoc saepius, facies <sup>1</sup></p><p>suas quandoque variabant, per mutationes ab uno limite ad alterum, sed usque eadem facies in genere retinebatur, sic ut eluceret semper affectio dominans cum suis variationibus, sic erant quasi facies totius affectionis istius <sup>2</sup></p><p>speciei, cum suis variationibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has saepius; facies<p>2.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
