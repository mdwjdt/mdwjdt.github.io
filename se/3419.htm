<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3419</h4><p>3419. The whole grand human being is organic, and relates to the purer and grosser membranous parts of the body, and the Lord Alone to the inward parts, thus to the bloods in the derivative parts<p>From what has been observed concerning the grand human being, it is clearly only organic, consequently membranous, with which the organic and membranous parts of the body interact that are activated by the life of the Lord, thus think and act from the Lord. The Lord Alone, being life, vivifies and activates them, thus He is made present also by means of the animate spirits or bloods in the outermost nature of the body - for His life is in both lasts and firsts. Therefore whoever wants to live or lead their own life cannot be in the Grand human being, but insofar as they so desire, they expel themselves. They are purged away and rejected.<p>Therefore, the whole grand human is a yielding force, or passive <sup>1</sup>force, which is called "dead in itself," while the Lord Alone is the active, activating, or living force. Hence there is a marriage, and heaven is compared to the bride or wife, and the Lord Alone is the Bridegroom. 1748, 1 Oct.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin is vis patiens, sue vis passiva, where both words are properly translated "passive." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3419</h4><p>3419. THAT THE WHOLE OF THE GRAND MAN IS AN ORGANISM, AND REPRESENTS THE PURER MEMBRANES [PRINCIPLES] AND GROSSER THINGS OF THE BODY, AND THE LORD ALONE [REPRESENTS] INTERIORS, THUS THE BLOODS IN THE DERIVATIVES.<p>From what has been observed concerning the Grand Man, it is evident that he is only an organism, consequently a membraneous [principle], to which correspond the organic, or membraneous things of the body, which are actuated by the life of the Lord, thus think and act from the Lord. The Lord alone, inasmuch as he is life, vivifies and actuates these things, therefore is represented also by the animal spirits, or bloods, in the ultimate nature of the body: for his life is as well in ultimates, as in firsts primaries. Wherefore, whoever wishes to live, or act his own life, cannot be in the Grand Man, but so far as he desire this, so far does he expel himself, is purged away and rejected [therefrom]; wherefore the whole of the Grand Man is a patient force, or passive force, which is termed dead in itself; but the Lord alone is the active force, the agent, or living force: hence [comes] marriage, and [hence] heaven is compared to a spouse [bride], or wife, and the Lord alone is the bridegroom. - 1748, October 1. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3419 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3419. Quod totus maximus homo sit organicus, et referat membranacea puriora et crassiora corporis, et Solus Dominus interiora, ita in derivatis sanguines<p>Ex iis quae de maximo homine observata sunt, constat, quod modo sit organicus, proinde membranaceum, cui correspondent organica seu membranacea corporis, quae vita Domini aguntur, ita ex Domino cogitant et agunt: Solus Dominus quia vita, vivificat et actuat ea, ita repraesentatur quoque per spiritus animales, seu sanguines, in ultima corporis natura: nam vita Ipsius tam in ultimis quam in primis est. Quare quisquis suam vitam vult vivere seu agere, non potest esse in Maximo homine, sed quantum cupit, tantum expellit se, repurgatur, et rejicitur: quare totus maximus homo est vis patiens, seu vis passiva, quae vocatur mortua in se, at Solus Dominus, vis activa, agens, seu viva; inde conjugium, et coelum comparatur sponsae seu uxori, et Dominus Solus Sponsus. 1748, 1 Oct. </p>
