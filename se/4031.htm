<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4031</h4><p>4031. The lucidity was shown to me in which those live who constitute the inner parts of the nostrils. It was one beautifully varied by streaks of golden flame, standing for the feelings; and a lucidity varied by streaks of silver light, standing for spiritual qualities there. And I was shown that they also have open holes, but not upwards, nor downwards, but toward the side, through which, as they showed me, they see a sky blue heaven beautifully studded with tiny stars, and that with them there is an abundance of light, flaming, golden for heavenly qualities, and shining, silvery for spiritual ones. They said that sometimes there is a great light - not entering through the holes, but within their chambers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4031</h4><p>4031. A lucidity was shown me in which those live who constitute the internals of the nostrils. It was a light beautifully varied with streaks of golden flame, representing the things of affection; and varied also by streaks of silver light to denote the spiritual things there. It was shown also that they had open holes [foramina], but not above or below, but on the side, through which, as was shown me, they see an azure heaven studded with beautiful little stars. It was perceived also that there is with them a copious light, a golden flaming light for celestial things, and a silver shining light for spiritual things. It was said too that the light was sometimes very splendid, not, however, that which entered through the holes, but that which was within their chambers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4031 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4031. Ostensum mihi est lucidum in quo vivunt ii, qui interna narium constituunt, erat lucidum variatum pulchre venis aureae flammae, pro iis quae affectiones sunt; et lucidum variatum venis argenteae lucis, pro spiritualibus ibi: et ostensum quod quoque habeant foramina patentia, sed non sursum, nec deorsum, sed a latere, per quae, sicut ostensum mihi, vident coelum coeruleum cum stellis parvulis pulchre, et quod apud eos tanta lux sit, flammea aurea pro coelestibus, et lucida argentea pro spiritualibus, dicentes quod quandoque magna lux sit, non per foramina intrans, sed in eorum conclavibus. </p>
