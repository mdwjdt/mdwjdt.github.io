<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 891</h4><p>891. Moreover, even good spirits were not able to tell but that it was that same person, because all and the least details can be counterfeited so as to corroborate it. Inward angels, however, know [the truth], as I was told and shown.<p>891[a]. <sup>1</sup>He who is led by the Lord, sees in every least thing he does whether it is [merely] permitted, whether consent is given and the thing is pleasing [to Him], in short, whether it should be done<p>There is with those who are being led by the Lord a certain inward sight or consciousness in regard to things that are to be done, especially in the act of doing them. This sight is so clear to those who are led by the Lord, that they do not do any least thing unless it is either by the Lord's good pleasure, or by His consent, or by His permission. These are distinct from each other, and the person is also given to see them distinctly, but this fact cannot be understood by anyone except by such a one.<p>Others, no matter how well the matter is explained, along with all the circumstances, still do not believe it, because they do not understand. For example, even spirits who are quite intelligent still cannot be convinced that it is so. They who know it, and do not want to think from themselves, and are therefore in the way of truth, acquire such a sight. The main reason why others cannot believe this is that they think they would then be deprived entirely of their own free will in doing and thinking what they love, supposing they would thus be as if dead. I said to them, however, that then they are alive, because living from oneself is rather death, because there is nothing of good from what is one's own. Therefore no one should be surprised if someone says he sees what should be done; because this is truth, and it is part of faith. 1748, 20 February.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original, the number 891 is repeated here and 892 does not occur. It is left unchanged here because it is referred to in the index. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 891</h4><p>891. Moreover, even the good spirits could then know no other than that it was the same man, for each and all things can be so fashioned that they confirm. The interior angels, on the other hand, know this, as I was told and shown. <p>891[a.] <sup>1</sup>HE WHO IS LED BY THE LORD PERCEIVES IN THE SINGLE THINGS HE DOES WHETHER IT IS A PERMISSION, WHETHER IT IS GIVEN BY LEAVE, AND WHETHER IT IS WELL PLEASING: IN A WORD, WHETHER IT IS THUS TO BE DONE <p>With those who are led by the Lord there is a certain interior perception or observance as to those things which are to be done, especially in the doing of them. This is so manifest to those led by the Lord that in the single things they do there is nothing but what is either from the Lord's good pleasure, or from leave, or from permission. These are distinct in themselves, and can also be distinctly perceived. But this cannot be understood by a man unless he is such; others, howsoever these things are described with their circumstances, still do not believe them because they do not understand, even as spirits who are intellectual enough still cannot be persuaded that it is so. Those who know, and who have no desire to think from themselves, and so are in the way of truth, acquire such a perception. The reason that others cannot believe is principally because they suppose that they would thus be entirely deprived of their liberty of doing, as also of thinking, which they love; they suppose that thus they would be as if dead. I said to them that they then live, because to live from one's self is rather death, there being nothing of good from the proprium. Wherefore no one ought to wonder if any one say that he perceives what should be done, for this is the truth, and this is of faith. 1748, Feb. 20. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the manuscript the number 891 is repeated here and 892 does not occur. It is left unchanged on account of references in the Index. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 891 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>891. Praeterea spiritus etiam boni nec aliter scire tunc potuerunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quam quod idem homo sit, quia omnia et singula ita effingi queunt, ut confirment. At vero angeli interiores id sciunt, ut mihi dictum est, et ostensum.<p>891a. <sup>2</sup></p><p>Qui a Domino ducitur, is percipit in singulis quid agit, num permissum sit, et num venia detur et num bene placeat, verbo num ita agendum<p>Est quaedam perceptio interior, seu animadvertentia, in iis, quae agenda <sup>3</sup></p><p>apud eos, qui a Domino ducuntur cumprimis in agendo, quae tam manifesta est iis, qui <sup>4</sup></p><p>a Domino ducuntur, ut in singulis nihil agunt nisi vel ex beneplacito Domini, vel ex venia, vel ex permissione, quae distincta in se sunt, ac distincte etiam percipi dantur, sed hoc non potest intelligi ab homine nisi tali, caeteri utcunque ea describuntur cum suis circumstantiis, usque quia non intelligunt, nec credunt; sicut spiritus etiam satis intellectuales, usque non persuaderi possunt, quod tale sit. Ii qui sciunt et non cupiunt cogitare ex se, et sic sunt in via veritatis, ii talem perceptionem nanciscuntur; quod alii non credere possint, est praecipua causa, quia sic putant orbari prorsus suomet arbitrio agendi, sicut cogitandi, quod amant, putant sic se quasi mortuos esse, quibus tamen dixi, quod tunc vivant, quia vivere ex se, est potius mors, quia nihil boni ex proprio, quare nemo mirari debet, si quis dicat, quod percipiat quid agendum, quia hoc est veritas, et hoc est fidei. 1748, 20 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has poterunt<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has 891 quoque in indice; in J.F.I.
