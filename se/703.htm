<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 703</h4><p>703. On admission into the inward heaven, <sup>1</sup>a continuation from the other page [<a href="702.htm">702</a>]<p>I also heard, or saw, the reason why no more than twelve societies were admitted at the same time, and after that about eight societies of the other sex. It was because they were thus being distributed into heavenly societies that had been formed there and for many reasons could not be brought in all at once, but only in succession. For as soon as they are let in, they are received by angelic societies according to a secret mode of distribution ordained by the Lord, into their own inheritance, so to speak. This can be called their lot, because it is done by the Lord in secret, or the Lord providing.<p>Admitted in this way, everyone to their own societies, they are welcomed wholeheartedly and with joy, and all love and friendship is shown to them. But when they do not freely want to remain in those societies, they are received by different societies, and so on, until they come to a society in which there is harmony and unanimity. There they remain even until they come out still more perfect, and so one after another is lifted or raised up into greater glory.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See 262 and footnote 3. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 703</h4><p>703. CONTINUATION CONCERNING ADMISSION INTO THE INTERIOR HEAVEN <p>I also heard or perceived that the reason why no more than the twelve societies were admitted together at the same time, and afterwards about eight societies of the other sex, was that in this manner they were arranged into the heavenly societies there being formed. They could not be introduced at the same time, but this happened successively for many reasons, for as soon as they are admitted they are received by angelic societies and ordered according to their latent dispositions by the Lord, thus it is as if they entered into their own inheritance. This can be called their lot because it is effected by the Lord secretly, that is, by the Lord providing. In this way they are admitted, each into his own society, and they are received whole-heartedly and with joy, and all love and friendship is shown them. But when they are no longer freely willing to remain in such societies, they are received by other societies, and this continues until they come into one in which there is concordance and unanimity. There they remain even until they go forth still more perfect; and so one after another they are elevated or exalted to greater glory. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 703 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>703. De admissione in coelum interius, continuatio ab altera pagina [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_703/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_702" target=_top>702</a>] Causam quoque audivi seu percepi, cur non plures simul admitterentur , quam duodecim societates postea fere octo societates alterius sexus: erat, quod disponerentur illi in societates ibi formatas coelestes, nec potuissent simul introduci, sed quod hoc successive fit, ex multis causis, nam ut primum intromittuntur <sup>1</sup></p><p>, recipiuntur a societatibus angelicis <sup>2</sup></p><p>, secundum dispositionem latentem, a Domino ordinatam, quasi sic in haereditatem suam; hoc potest dici sors, quia a Domino fit, latenter, seu Domino providente, sic admissi, quivis in suas societates, ex toto corde, et cum gaudio recipiuntur, et iis omnis amor ac amicitia exhibetur, at dum in societatibus istis non libenter volunt esse, ab aliis societatibus recipiuntur, et sic usque dum in societatem veniant, in qua concordia est, et una nimitas, ibi manent tamdiu, dum adhuc perfectiores evadunt, et sic unus post alterum elevatur seu exaltatur, in majorem gloriam.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
