<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3823</h4><p>3823. The spirits who came in front accosted me, saying that they were men; when I said to them that they were not men, as the term is understood, i. e. men possessed of a body, but (that they were spirits, and thus also were men, because whatever there is in a spirit conspires to that which is of man, and so finally to a form similar to the [human] body; to this I apperceived no denial, but [on the contrary] they confirmed it. They said moreover that men are dissimilar, or that there was no society in which one was [wholly] like another; and as this seemed to me impossible, viz. that there should be a society of dissimilars, I spoke with them concerning it, [saying] that they might still be consociated by the Lord to one end, which might act as a kind of common [general] cause to bring them together into a certain unity. But they said they were such that everyone speaks differently [from the rest], and yet they still think alike. </p>
