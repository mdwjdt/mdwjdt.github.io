<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3685</h4><p>3685. About societies in the other life, and about love<p>I saw spirits around me, as on several occasions, as if they were not in any society, but flowing freely, as it were, which is the result of the fantasy of those who imagine spirits to be like that that they are like an invisible atmosphere thus floating in the universe. Their persuasion was communicated to me, which was such that they imagined there was no society, but only spirits thus flowing almost invisible in the universe. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3685</h4><p>3685. CONCERNING SOCIETIES IN THE OTHER LIFE AND [CONCERNING] LOVE.<p>Spirits were seen around me, as has often times happened, apparently not united in any society, but flowing as it were at large, which is from the phantasy of those that suppose spirits to be like the invisible atmosphere, and that they thus float about in the universe. Their persuasion was communicated to me, which was such that they supposed there was no society, but that spirits are beings, thus flowing scarcely visible about the universe. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3685 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3685. De societatibus in altera vita, et amore<p>Visi sunt spiritus circum me, ut aliquoties, tanquam non in aliqua societate, sed libere quasi fluentes, quod est ex phantasia eorum, qui putant spiritus tales, quod sicut invisibilis atmosphaera, et quod sic fluitent in universo, eorum persuasio mecum communicata, quae talis erat, ut putarent nullam societatem esse, sed spiritus sic fluentes inconspicui esse in universo; </p>
