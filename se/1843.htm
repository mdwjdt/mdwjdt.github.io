<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1843</h4><p>1843. Later, spirits were let into that same field who tried to make themselves intelligent from their own power, but the resulting condition of these was portrayed in their faces. They appeared sharp in the face, fairly good-looking, and wearing a pointy cap that went up to a sharp point. They did not appear as human faces, but like lifeless sculptures. This is the condition that field brings on spirits who try from their own power to bring themselves [into intelligence] and be spiritual from themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1843</h4><p>1843. Afterwards those were intromitted into the same sphere who would fain make themselves intellectual from themselves, but the quality of their state was represented by their faces. They appeared as having faces that were sharp, though quite comely, and wore upon their heads sharp-cornered hats, from which darts projected. These faces appeared, however, not so much human as they did as sculptured faces, void of life. Such is the state of those in a sphere of this kind, who would voluntarily intrude themselves, and be spiritual from themselves.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1843 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1843. Postea in eandem sphaeram intromissi sunt, qui se intellectuales ex semet facere vellent, sed quomodo status eorum existeret, repraesentabatur per eorum facies, apparebant acuta facie, satis pulchra, pileo instructi acuto, ex quo spiculum erigebatur; apparebant non ut facies humanae, sed ut sculptilia, absque vita, talium est status, in sphaera tali, qui se inferre volunt, ex semet, et spirituales ex semet esse. </p>
