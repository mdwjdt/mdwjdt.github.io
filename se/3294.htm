<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3294</h4><p>3294. About some naked ones<p>Some female spirits who had slipped into companies of good spirits, being recognized as different and separated from them, were appearing to them as naked, as though testifying to their innocence. They were the kind who in the life of the body for various reasons, even such as bad fortune, had put on an air of piety. When they have been let back into that state, one cannot tell but that they were pious then in the world. But still, when they are restored to their own normal state of life, they are among the deceptive women, as they are also in the world when delivered from their bad fortune. But the angels can distinguish them, no matter what degree of piety they put on. 1748, 23 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3294</h4><p>3294. CONCERNING CERTAIN NAKED ONES.<p>Certain [quoedam] of those, who had insinuated themselves into the companies of the good were recognized to be of a different character; hence being separated, they appeared to them [as] naked, as if [thereby] they attested their innocence. They were such as in the life of the body, from many causes, in like manner, also from misfortunes have displayed themselves as pious; when remitted into that state they cannot be distinguished [by the good spirits] because they were of such a nature when in the world; but yet when restored to the general state of their life, they are amongst deceivers, just as is the case, after they are freed from misfortunes in the world. But yet angels distinguish them in every state of [their] piety. - 1748, September 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3294 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3294. De quibusdam nudis<p>Quaedam earum, quae se insinuaverant consortiis bonorum, cognitae quod aliae essent, inde separatae apparebant iis nudae, sicut innocentiam suam testarentur, erant tales quae in vita corporis ex pluribus causis, sicut etiam ex infortuniis, se pias exhibuerunt, quae cum in eum statum remissae sunt, non dignosci possunt, quin <sup>1</sup></p><p>{a} tales fuerunt tunc in mundo, sed usque cum statui vitae suae communi restituuntur, sunt inter deceptrices, sicut etiam postea cum liberantur ab infortuniis in mundo: sed ab angelis usque dignoscuntur in cujuscunque pietatis statu sunt. 1748, 23 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
