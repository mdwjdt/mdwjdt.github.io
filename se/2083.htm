<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2083</h4><p>2083. About portrayals of a very occult kind by spirits<p>There are some types of portrayals that can neither be described in words, nor grasped by a human mental image, for they are matters linked to ideas that are not expressible, nor intelligible to an awake human being, but only to one in a sleeping or ecstatic state. Then they are well understood as if one were awake, but when passing into wakefulness, one does not know in the least how to express them as mental images to which more intelligible matters are linked.<p>Images of this kind were just shown to me in a state verging more toward sleep than wakefulness. One concerned how far dancing at weddings is allowable or not, and like matters. But I could not understand these subjects. They were in a connected series. I do not doubt that something of a heavenly secret is involved, for they are portrayals by spirits while in that state, arising from the clearer portrayals of the angels. 1748, 27 May. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2083</h4><p>2083. CONCERNING A MORE RECONDITE REPRESENTATION OF SPIRITS. <p>There were displayed species of representation, such as cannot be described in words nor received by human idea; for things are joined to such ideas as are not expressible nor intelligible to man when awake, but only when he is in a state of sleep or ecstasy, in which state they are perceived by man fully as well as when awake; but when he comes into a state of wakefulness, he does not at all know how to express these things, namely, the ideas to which are connected things which are more easily of comprehension. Such ideas were also shown me now, in a state verging more towards sleep than wakefulness. The [representations] related to dancing at marriage festivities, how far allowable or not, and the like, but I could not understand the things. They were in a series and connection [nexus]: that there was in them something of a celestial arcanum, I do not doubt, for they are representations of spirits whilst in such a state, and are derived from differences of angels. - 1748, May 27. </p>
