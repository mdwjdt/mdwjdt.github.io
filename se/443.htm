<p>443.此外，在被当作圣徒和神明来崇拜的人当中，只有三种人被展示给我，即：一种是那些厌恶这种崇拜，在天使之列并由天使守护的人；一种是那些不想在众神之列，也不想被当作众神来崇拜，但仍保留着某些渣滓，尽管嘴上否认的人。第三种是亵渎的人，他们接受这种崇拜并想被尊为圣徒和神明，这些人很悲惨、头脑发昏、愚蠢糊涂。（1748年1月3日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 443</h4><p>443. Moreover, of people who were worshipped as saints and thus as gods, only three kinds were depicted to me: namely, those who turned away from that worship, and were among angels and under their protection; then, those who did not want to be among the gods and be worshiped as gods, but nevertheless retain some of the dregs, even though they repudiate it with the mouth. The third kind is profane, accepting that kind of worship and wanting to be acknowledged as gods. They are miserable, silly and stupid. 1748, the 3rd day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 443</h4><p>443. Moreover, of the men who were worshipped as saints and thus as gods, three kinds only were represented to me. Namely, there were those who are averse to that worship, who were among the angels and guarded by them. Then there are those who do not wish to be among the gods and to be worshipped as gods, but who still retain something of the outward appearance although they repudiate it with the mouth. The third kind are the profane who receive such worship and want to be acknowledged as saints and gods. They are miserable, infatuated and stupid. 1748, Jan. 3. </p>

Praeterea homines, qui pro sanctis et sic dii colebantur, modo triplicis generis mihi repraesentati <sup>2</sup></p><p>sunt qui nempe aversarentur cultum istum, essentque inte angelos, ab iis custoditi; tum qui non vellent esse inter deos <sup>3</sup></p><p>et coli pro diis, verum usque aliquid retinent ex faece <sup>4</sup></p><p>tametsi oretenus id repudiant. Tertium genus est prophanum, quod recipit talem cultum, et pro iis se agnosci volunt, sunt miserabiles, fatui ac stulti. 1748, die 3 Jan. </p>
