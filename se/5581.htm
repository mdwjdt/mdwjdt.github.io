<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5581</h4><p>5581. It was said also that when writing first began, the ancients, that is to say, those who were before the Hebrews, before the Hebrew language existed, wrote in this way, but that the Hebrew language to some extent approached [it], but nonetheless that it had moved away from it, since there are sharp terminations in the letters which are not in the heavenly language. However, still in it and in its individual words that are in the Word, there are heavenly things in the letters themselves which are understood by the intermediate angels, thus inmostly [there are] also [heavenly things] there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5581</h4><p>5581. It was also said, that the ancients, when writing first began, wrote thus, namely, those who preceded the Hebrews, before the Hebrew language existed; but that the Hebrew language indeed somewhat approached it, though it still deviated from it, inasmuch as in it there are sharp terminations in the syllables, which there are not in the celestial language. Still, however, in it, and in every single one of its words which are in the Word, celestial things are in the very syllables themselves; which things are understood by the intermediate angels. Therefore, also, [such celestial things] are inmostly therein. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5581 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5581. Dictum quoque quod antiqui, cum primum scriptura incepit ita scripserint, nempe qui ante Heberum, antequam Hebraea lingua, sed quod Hebraea lingua quodammodo accedat ad aliquid [ejus] sed usque quod recesserit ab illa, quoniam sunt ibi terminationes acutae in syllabis, quae non in lingua coelesti, sed usque in illa et in singulis ejus vocibus quae in Verbo sint in ipsis syllabis coelestia, quae ab intermediis angelis intelliguntur, ita intime quoque ibi. </p>
