<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4805</h4><p>4805. The quality of their state as to truth was seen in a spiritual idea. It was dark colored, as if there were a covering with which it was covered. But because one of them used a trick to bring in a kind of light above, it was opened to view. And then it was [seen to be] diabolical, for the worst hell flowed in, and he was in a deplorable state. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4805</h4><p>4805. The quality of their state as to truth appeared by means of a spiritual idea. It was obscure, as if there were a covering wherewith it was covered over. But, because one induced, by art, the appearance of some light above, therefore, the covering was opened, and then the state was diabolical, for the worst hell inflowed: he, also [who employed the art], was in a deplorable state. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4805 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4805. Apparuit qualis illis status veri per ideam spiritualem, erat ille obscurus sicut tegumentum, quo tegebatur, sed quia unus per artem induxit speciem alicujus lucis supra, ideo aperiebatur id, et tunc erat diabolicum, nam influebat infernum pessimum; et ille in statu lamentabili erat. </p>
