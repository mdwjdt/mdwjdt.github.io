<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2221</h4><p>2221. Just from the ability of spirits and angels to reflect, it is obvious that they are only organic instruments<p>When I was in conversation with angels, it happened that we were thinking about reflection, or paying attention to something, and the fact that only reflection causes spirits and angels to know what they are, that things are as they are. Reflection constitutes the essence of thinking, for without it the thinking has no life by sensation. So when, due to objects that came up, we happened to speak about reflection, and the fact that the ability to reflect on something does not belong to the person who is reflecting, but that it flows in, then I was given to see clearly by a spiritual mental image that we are only organic instruments, and that reflection is given by the Lord. It cannot possibly come from any other source. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2221</h4><p>2221. THAT IT MAY BE EVIDENT MERELY FROM THE FACULTY OF REFLECTING, WHICH BELONGS TO SPIRITS AND ANGELS, THAT THEY ARE ONLY ORGANIC POWERS. <p>While I was in discourse with angels it happened that it was thought about reflection or attention to a thing, that it is only reflection which causes spirits and angels to know that they are of such and such a quality, are so and so circumstanced, and that it constitutes the essence of thought; for without reflection is not given the life of sense nor of thought: and when it happened to speak from objects of reflection, and [to say] that it or reflection was not his who reflects, but belongs to that which inflows, then it was given to observe by a spiritual idea that we are only organic powers, and that reflection is given by the Lord. From no other source can it come. </p>

Quod ex sola facultate reflectendi spirituum et angelorum, constare possit, quod solum sint potentiae organicae<p>Cum in loquela cum angelis essem, contigit, quod cogitaretur de reflexione, seu attentione rei, quod solum sit reflexio, quae facit, ut sciant spiritus et angeli, quod tales sint, quod ita se habeat, quaeque <sup>1</sup></p><p>constituit essentiam cogitationis, nam absque reflexione non datur vita sensu nec cogitationis, cumque contingeret ex objectis loqui de reflexione, et quod ea seu reflexio non sit ejus qui reflectit, sed quod influat <sup>2</sup></p><p>, tunc perspicere dabatur idea spirituali, quod solum potentiae organicae simus, et quod reflexio a Domino detur, aliunde nequaquam venire potest.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quodque<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
