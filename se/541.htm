<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>541.关于他们与其灵人的对话，有两种恶灵侵扰他们。一种是最坏的。当这种恶灵到来时，一种恐惧、战兢就从整体上抓住他们，就像当他到我这里时，这种恐惧、战兢也明显抓住我，以致我因内心的惊恐而吓得发抖一样。他出现在我面前，我观看他，发现他很黑，就像一团乌云，他前面有许多星星。他来到我的左侧，朝我的后背斜靠。他跟我说话，并且想以他与木星居民说话的那种方式说话，但被他们的天使（关于他们，稍后会有论述，542节）阻止了。这个灵人说，他能知道他们所想所做的一切，他也确实从他们的记忆中把它们提取出来了；当主允许时，这是灵人很容易办到的事。他想以这种方式因我所思所做的事而责备我，他想把这些事提取出来，但被禁止了。他说，他以这种方式责备别人；但让他困惑的是，他却无法向我如此行。他说，他还被允许通过惩罚惩戒他们，甚至惩罚到他们再也无法忍受的地步，如在许可的情况下，利用关节的疼痛，手指和脚的关节扭曲，以及脸上的某些轻微刺痛进行惩罚。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 541</h4><p>541. As regards their speaking with their spirits, there are two kinds of evil spirits who molest them. <sup>1</sup>One kind is their worst. When he comes, a trembling and a kind of fear seizes them collectively, such as also seized me visibly when he came to me, so that I trembled, deeply frightened.<p>Looking at him as he was placed before me, I saw that he was a dark being, like a dark cloud, with several stars in front of him. He came up to my left side, retreating toward my back. He spoke with me, trying to talk with me in the same way as he did with them, but he was prevented by their angels, about whom something will be told presently [<a href="542.htm">542</a>]. He said that he could find out all that they had thought and done, which he does actually draw out of their memory. This is easy for spirits to do, when the Lord permits it.<p>Thus he wanted to reprove me for things I had thought and done, which he wanted to bring out, but it had been forbidden him. Still, he said that this is how he reproves others, surprised that he could not do so with me. He said that he is also allowed to chastise them by punishments, such as pains in the joints, even to such an intensity that they can bear it no longer - such as a twisting of the joints in the fingers, and feet, and also by some pains like gentle pricks in the face - subject to permission.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The second kind is spoken of in 545. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 541</h4><p>541. In regard to their speech with their spirits, there are two kinds of evil spirits who infest them. One kind is the worst of them. When such a one comes a horror with a certain fear seizes them in general, like that which also manifestly seized upon me when one came to me, so that being interiorly terrified, I was horror-struck as I beheld him presented before me. He was dark, like a dark cloud, with a number of stars before him. He applied himself to my left side, inclining himself towards the back. He spoke with me, and wanted to speak in the same manner with one as he did with the inhabitants of Jupiter, but he was prevented by their angels (concerning whom presently). That spirit said he could know all that they had thought and done, which he also drew forth from their memory; this is an easy matter with spirits when the Lord permits. In such a way he wanted to reprove me for things thought and done, which he wanted to bring forth, but it was forbidden him. He said that in this way he reproved others, and wondered that he could not do so to me. He also said that it was allowed him to castigate them with punishments even to such a degree that they could bear it no longer, as by pains in the joints, or by twisting the joints of the fingers and of the feet, and also by certain, as it were, gentle prickings in the face, according to permission. </p>
