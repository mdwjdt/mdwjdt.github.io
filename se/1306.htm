<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1306</h4><p>1306. About a certain righteous person<p>[As said <a href="1301.htm">1301</a>], the spirits who had put on and striven for holiness in life appear as to their body from the neck to the waist with a radiant human color, the remaining parts, as the face and the loins, not appearing.<p>Similarly, those who had thought themselves righteous in life, having tried to surpass all the rest in their righteousness, appear, not with a radiant human color, but dressed in a beautiful snow-white garment, showing their righteousness. But this later turns, not into black as before [<a href="1302.htm">1302</a>], but into a brownish color having the ruddy shade of old blood, at the sight of which other spirits likewise flee from him.<p>Such a spirit was seen by me, dressed in a beautifully shining linen garment, but I was told [he was one], and the color into which he is turned was portrayed by a dim vision. 1748, 12 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1306</h4><p>1306. CONCERNING A CERTAIN RIGHTEOUS ONE <p>As those spirits who have displayed and affected sanctity during their life appear to be of a human white color as to their body from the neck to the loins the other parts, as the face and part of the loins, not appearing [see n. <a href="../se/1301.htm">1301</a> ] so those who during their life have considered themselves to be righteous, and wanted to excel others by their own righteousness, appear not in a human white color, but as clothed in a beautiful snow-white garment in which [such righteousness] appears. But afterwards this color is turned not into black, as in the former case, but into a brown in which is the redness of old blood, and even the other spirits flee away when they see this color. I saw such a spirit clothed in a beautiful shining linen garment, but the color into which it was turned was mentioned and represented by an obscure vision. 1748, Mar. 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1306 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1306. De quodam justo<p>Sicut spiritus, qui sanctitatem praetulerunt et affectarunt in vita, candido humano colore, quoad corpus a cervice ad lumbos apparent, caeteris, ut facie, et parte lumborum, non apparentibus [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1306/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1301" target=_top>1301</a>]: ita qui justos se putarunt in vita, sic ut justitia suamet excellere voluerint reliquis, ii non humano candido colore, sed induti apparent indusio pulchro niveo, quo apparet, sed is postea vertitur, non in nigrum, ut prior [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1306/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1302" target=_top>1302</a>], sed in bruneum, in quo rubeum vetustum sanguineum, quo colore viso, etiam alii spiritus eum fugiunt. Spiritus talis mihi visus est, indutus indusio pulchre lineo nitido, sed dictum {a} per visionem obscuram repraesentatus est color in quem vertitur. 1748, 12 Martius. </p>
