<p>577.尽管如此，这些灵人都极其敏感，我能从一个被提入灵人的更高气场中的人身上推断出这一点。那里的灵人无法与他和谐相处，因为他们太愚笨了；事实上，他们无法渗透到他正在思想的东西中，直到他来到那些以前和他相似的人中间。但他仍旧无法长时间地与他们在一起，因为相似的品质还粘附在他身上。（1748年1月27日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 577</h4><p>577. Still, these are quite perceptive spirits, as I was able to infer from one who had been elevated into the realm of higher spirits. The spirits there could not harmonize with him, because they were too dense, for they could not penetrate the things that he was thinking - until he came among some who had been like himself. But even in their company he could not remain for long, because that same quality was still clinging to him. 1748, 27 January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 577</h4><p>577. Still these spirits are very sensitive as I could conclude from one who was elevated into the higher sphere of spirits. The spirits who were there could not agree with him because they were grosser, for they could not penetrate into the things he was thinking, until he came among those who had formerly been similar. But still he could not long remain in their company, because as yet, something similar inhered. 1748, Jan. 27. </p>

Sunt usque spiritus admodum sensibiles, quod concludere potui ab eo, qui in superiorum <sup>1</sup></p><p>spirituum sphaeram elevatus est, quod spiritus ibi non cum eo concordare possent, quia crassiores erant, nam non penetrare potuerunt ea, quae cogitabat, priusquam inter eos venit, qui similes olim fuerant, sed usque in consortio eorum non diu persistere potuit, quia adhuc inhaerebat simile. 1748, 27 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript; in J.F.I.
