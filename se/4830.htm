<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4830</h4><p>4830. Garments are criminal statutes and also civil law, economic affairs, and the like<p>There was a certain man whom I knew in the world (Harold Wallerius) who worked at getting rich by twisting the laws or using them for unjust ends and did this for a long time. Retaining this malice in the other life, he sat in a corner with many and without their knowing put subjects before me and worked incognito at many things, and also sought to captivate the mind with lascivious loves. He was discovered, and when he was subsequently dragged away to punishment for his malice, he was constantly changing his garments, dressing now in a woman's, now in a girl's, now in a man's, and in many others' garments. In addition, he also made himself a lofty spirit and so withdrew their sight. This went on for a short time, and they were unable to remove him. However, later he was taken away. This made obvious that the garments were criminal statutes, and those of a woman were appearances of what is just, and so on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4830</h4><p>4830. THAT GARMENTS ARE PUBLIC TRUTHS, DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE LIKE: THEY ALSO RELATE TO CIVIL LAWS.<p>There was a certain one, known to me in the world (Harald Wallerius <sup>1</sup>), who then studied to amass riches, by perversions or applications of the laws to what was [not] just; and this he had done for a long time. Retaining the same wickedness in the other life, he sat with many in a corner; and they unwittingly projected subjects to me, and plotted many things in secret, and also labored to captivate the mind through lascivious loves. He was detected; and when he was dragged away thence to the punishment of his wickedness, he continually changed his garments, and put on now women's, now girls', now men's and many others', and also made himself a subtle spirit, and so cheated them before their eyes. This lasted for an hour, and they could not take him away; but, still, he was taken away afterwards. Thereby it was manifested that garments were public truths, and women's, appearances of justice, etc.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Or Valerius (see Dr. Tafel's Documents, p. 676). </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4830 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4830. Quod vestes sint vera forensia, tum legum civilium, oeconomica, et similia<p>Quidam mihi in mundo notus (:Har. Waller:) qui tunc studuit lucrari pecunias per legum perversiones vel applicationes ad [non] justum, et hoc diu fecerat, ille in altera vita retinens eandem malitiam, sedebat cum pluribus in angulo, et illis insciis projiciebat ad me subjecta, et plura incognito moliebatur, et quoque per amores lascivos captare studebat animum, is detectus, cum inde abriperetur ad poenam suae malitiae, mutabat continuo vestes, et nunc induebat faeminas, nunc puellares, nunc viriles, et plures alias, et quoque se subtilem spiritum fecit, et sic subtraxit oculum eorum, hoc perdurabat per horulam, et non potuerunt illum auferre, sed usque postea ablatus est; per hoc manifestabatur quod vestes essent vera forensia, et faeminae apparentiae justi, et sic porro. </p>
