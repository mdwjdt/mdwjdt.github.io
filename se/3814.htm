<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3814</h4><p>3814. Someone spoke with me from a place rather high up in front, whom I then perceived to be Penn, from whom Pennsylvania [was named]. He spoke becomingly, and because he realized that they had been of this character, he declared that he had not, and that it was abominable, and that he wanted to disclaim any part in it, saying and asserting many more points that I do not remember. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3814</h4><p>3814. A certain person spoke with me from a higher place in front, of whom it was said that it was Penn, from whom Pennsylvania derives its name. He spoke well, and because he perceived their quality, he strongly affirmed that he was not such, and that it was abominable [that any should be, such], and that for himself he would disclaim all part in it; saying and asseverating many other things which I do not recollect. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3814 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3814. Quidam mecum loquutus ex altiori loco antrorsum, dictum quod esse Pen, ex quo Pensilvania, is bene loquutus, et quia percepit quod tales, contestatus quod talis non fuerit, et quod abominabile esset, et quod in eo nullam sibi partem vindicare vellet; plura, quae non memini, dicendo, et contestando. </p>
