<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3397</h4><p>3397. Inauguration into the first plane, or first faculty, enabling one to be in angelic companies, is from the Lord Alone<p>From what was said about the pre-adamites [<a href="3390.htm">3390-3394</a>], it was clear that that inauguration, which is the first, is granted by the Lord Alone, and indeed, the spirit not knowing it, for when he was thus mangled (and gnuggad <sup>1</sup>) by evil spirits, he was asleep, nor was he feeling the torment, but rather loving it, because the Lord was working through his inward parts so that he would long to conquer the outward evils. The greater weight was therefore within, so that he did not feel outward evil at all - besides which he was in a state of sleep and thus insensibility, so he did not know.<p>That they do not know is also proved by this, that later after a few hours, thus inaugurated he came to me and was surprised that he had changed, not knowing how it had happened. He was instructed by me how, and what his quality [now was]. Thus unknowingly man or spirit is prepared, and then reformed. 1748, 28 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "rubbed." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3397</h4><p>3397. THAT INAUGURATION INTO THE FIRST PLANE, OR FIRST FACULTY, SO AS TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING PRESENT IN ANGELIC COMPANIES, IS FROM THE LORD ALONE.<p>From what has been said of the pre-Adamites, it was apparent that the first inauguration is granted by the Lord alone, and even while the spirit is ignorant [thereof]; for when he is thus mangled [et gnuggad] by evil spirits, he was then in sleep and did not feel the torment, but rather loved [it], because the Lord acted through [his] interiors: so that he desired to overcome exterior evils: thus the preponderance was within, so he felt as it were nothing of exterior evil; besides which he was in a state of sleep, thus in insensibility, that thus he was ignorant of what they are ignorant, is also proved by this, that a few hours after being thus inaugurated he came to me and wondered that [he was] changed, so that he was ignorant how it happened; he was informed by me how [it was effected] and the nature of [the change]. Thus while man and spirit is ignorant, he is prepared and then reformed. - 1748, September 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3397 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3397. Quod inauguratio in planum primum seu facultatem primam, ut interesse possint consortiis angelicis, sit a Solo Domino<p>Ex iis, quae dicta sunt de praeadamitis [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3397/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_3390" target=_top>3390-3394</a>] constabat quod inauguratio ista, quae prima est, a Solo Domino, detur, et quidem spiritu nesciente; nam cum ita laceratus (et gnuggad {a}) erat a malis spiritibus, tunc erat in somno, nec cruciatum sentiebat, sed potius amabat, quia per interiora agebat Dominus, ita ut desideraret vincere mala exteriora, ita praepondium erat intus, sic malum exterius quasi nihil sensit, praeter quod in statu somni esset, sic in insensibilitate: quod sic nesciebat; quod nesciant, id quoque testatur, quod postea post paucas horas, ita inauguratus, ad me venit, et miratus quod mutatus, ita ut nesciverit quomodo factum, a me instructus, quomodo, et qualis; ita nesciente homine et spiritu praeparatur, et dein reformatur. 1748, 28 Sept. </p>
