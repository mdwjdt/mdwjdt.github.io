I no longer wanted to speak with him, because he was not open to reason. It was said that his inward thoughts are of the kind that can hardly be described. He revolves so many hatreds at once, spreading them all around, that the spirits round about complained, saying that they too were held by him as if bound up. So he is like mucus. And it was said that they were so enticed by his hatreds that they even cooperated with them, that is, especially those who were not of an unlike breed. Such is the destructive atmosphere of those spirits. 1748, 10 March. </p>

But afterwards, when he had been moved forwards, I was no longer willing to speak with him, because he was susceptible of no reason.

Such is the pernicious sphere of these spirits. 1748, Mar. 10. </p>

Talis est sphaera perniciosa talium. 1748, 10 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has quae </p>
