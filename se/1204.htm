<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1204</h4><p>1204. The spirits joined to people are like their fantasies<p>It is a general principle that such as people's fantasies are, such is the company in which they are kept. Also, that the more inflamed they become by their passion, the larger and the worse the company of such spirits becomes. For the life of corrupt people is fantasy, so one can tell by their fantasies and passions which spirits they are with-as I have come to know by much experience over a long period. 1748, 7 March. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1204</h4><p>1204. SUCH AS ARE THE PHANTASIES OF A MAN, SUCH ARE THE SPIRITS ADJOINED TO HIM <p>It is a general truth that a man is held in such a society of spirits as are his phantasies; also, that the more he is inflamed by cupidity, so much the greater and worse is the society of such spirits. For the life of a perverted man is phantasy; thus from his phantasies and cupidities it can be recognized with what spirits he is. This has been made known to me by manifold and long continued experience. 1748, Mar. 7. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1204 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1204. Quales sunt phantasiae, tales spiritus adjuncti sunt homini<p>Commune est, quod quales hominis phantasiae, in talium societate tenetur homo, quoque {a} magis accenditur cupiditate, eo talium spirituum societas major et deterior est; nam vita hominis perversi est phantasia, ita ex phantasiis et cupiditatibus cognosci potest, cum quibus sit, quod multiplici et diutina experientia, mihi notum factum est. 1748, 7 Martius. </p>
