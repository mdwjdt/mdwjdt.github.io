<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2732</h4><p>2732. About the opinion some hold that because the Lord gives everything of faith and nothing is mankind's, one must therefore play a passive role and hang down one's hands<p>Some spirits on hearing and thinking that the Lord Alone lives, and they are nothing, and that the main point of faith is that the Lord Alone gives faith and that people cannot will and do anything by their own powers, had fallen into that opinion that they should therefore give up doing and behave as if they were nothing, and await a driving force and impulse from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2732</h4><p>2732. CONCERNING THE OPINION [HELD BY] SOME THAT INASMUCH AS THE LORD GRANTS ALL THE THINGS OF FAITH, AND NOTHING IS OF MAN, THEREFORE [MAN] MAY ACT PASSIVELY AND DROP HIS HAND. <p>When certain spirits have heard and thought that the Lord alone lives, and they are nothing, and that it is an especial point of faith that the Lord alone gives faith, and that man of his own strength was adequate to nothing, nor could will, nor do anything, they fell into the opinion that thus they should drop [remitterent] everything, and act as if they were nothing, and expect the active force [vim agentem] and influx from the Lord. </p>

De quorundam opinione quod quia Dominus dat omnia fidei, et quid nihil hominis sit, ideo passivum aget et remittet manum<p>Quidam spiritus cum audiverint et cogitaverint, quod Dominus Solus vivat, et ii sint nihil, et quod fidei <sup>1</sup></p><p>praecipuum sit, quod Dominus Solus det fidem, nec hominem <sup>2</sup></p><p>quicquam suis viribus posse velle et agere, in eam opinionem lapsi sunt, quod sic remitterent omnia, et agerent sicut nihil forent, et exspectarent vim agentem, et influxum a Domino.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
