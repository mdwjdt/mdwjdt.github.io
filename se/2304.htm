<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2304</h4><p>2304. So that they will not be such, those mental images are sorted out, which is done in such a way that to elements in a given mental image, different ones are attached, so that the moment that image comes forth, everything joined to it comes forth at the same time, that is, everything that has been added to it. Consequently, no sooner does the person's mental image occur, than the Lord inspires everything He has joined and added to it, so that in the Lord's good pleasure, it turns into a beautiful mental image, that is, into a good outcome for the person concerned.<p>In the other life, no one may disfigure mental imagery, because the capability of spirits is such that they are not permitted to act without restraint or arbitrarily. The capability of spirits you may see discussed elsewhere[, <a href="2150.htm">2150-2153</a>]. ## </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2304</h4><p>2304. Such ideas are separated, and, indeed, in such a manner that to those things which are in a single idea other things may be adjoined; so that when that idea comes forth, then those things which are associated therewith may at the same time come forth, or such things as are also adjoined [adjuta]. Hence as soon as his idea comes forth, the Lord inserts those things which He has associated or added [thereto]; thereby the idea is turned into a beautiful one, according to the good pleasure of the Lord; this is the good of the subject. In the other life ideas [themselves] cannot be disfigured, because such is the state of spirits that they are not allowed to act from license or their own free will [proprio arbitrio]. Concerning the state of spirits, see elsewhere. - 1748, June 12. <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup></p>
