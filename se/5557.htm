<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5557</h4><p>5557. About the speech of spirits and angels<p>The speech of the heavenly and the spiritual angels differs greatly, as does also the speech of angels and spirits. The difference can be seen from the nature itself of their speech, they express mental images in natural sound. The sound is just like their love, thus, when they speak from their thoughts, they speak from their entire selves, it proceeds from every part of them - not only from the thought, but also from the whole body, for their whole spirit is their love, from this comes their speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5557</h4><p>5557. ABOUT THE SPEECH OF SPIRITS AND OF ANGELS. <p>The speech of the celestial and the spiritual angels differs greatly: also the speech of angels and spirits; which difference may be manifest from the very nature of their speech, in that they express [themselves] from ideas, in natural sound, which sound is, as it were, their love. When, therefore, [they speak] from their ideas, they speak such things from themselves. It proceeds from their whole [being], as if not only from the thought but also from the whole body. For the whole spirit is his love. Hence is their speech. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5557 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5557. De loquela spirituum et angelorum<p>Loquela angelorum coelestium et spiritualium valde differt; etiam loquela angelorum et spirituum, quae differentia patere potest ex ipsa natura loquelae illorum, quod exprimant ex ideis sono naturali, qui sonus est sicut eorum amor, ita cum ex ideis suas, ex se tote loquuntur, procedit ex illis totis, sicut non modo ex cogitatione sed etiam ex toto corpore, nam totus spiritus est suus amor, inde loquela eorum. </p>
