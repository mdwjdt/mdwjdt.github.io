<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2355</h4><p>2355. Souls and spirits also bring bodily elements with them into the other life<p>Touch, odor or smell, hearing, sight, as well as appetite, you may, I believe, see discussed previously [<a href="818.htm">818</a>, <a href="1243.htm">1243</a>]. [Newly arrived] souls are very surprised that they are just as they were when living in the body, so that they can tell no difference between their life in the body and after the death of the body, thinking they are in the body. I was prompted to tell them that the life of the body does not belong to the body, but only appears to be the body's, but it is the life of the spirit that is felt in the body. So spirits bring it with them, because they are accustomed to the physical parts while living in the body.<p>That life is of the spirit, and that the spirit has a body as a kind of covering or instrument for living on earth, is clear from the fact that when people are in a faint, the body is senseless, as it is also during sleep. So a bodily sense is not of the body, but it is of the spirit, yet fitted to the mold of the body's organs of sensation. Because the spirit has become accustomed to them, those senses therefore remain. 1748, 18 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2355</h4><p>2355. THAT SOULS AND SPIRITS ALSO TAKE WITH THEM INTO THE OTHER LIFE CORPOREAL THINGS. <p>I think you may see, touch, odor or smell hearing, sight, as also appetite already treated of. Souls wonder greatly that they are wholly as they were in the life of the body, so that they can make no distinction between their life in the body and after their death of the body, and suppose themselves to be [still] in the body. It was granted to tell them that the life of the body does not belong to the body, [but] only appears to belong to the body; but life which is felt in the body belonging to the spirit wherefore spirits take that life [eam] with them, because they have become accustomed to corporeals while they have lived in the body. That life belongs to the spirit, and that the spirit possesses the body as a sort of covering or instrument for living on the earth, may be evident from this, that when they are in want, as also when in sleep, they have no sense of a body wherefore the sense of the body does not belong to the body, but to the spirit; nevertheless, it is formed in the body according to the form of its organs, and hence [according to] perception, to which, because spirits are accustomed, the senses therefore remain to it. - 1748, June 18. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2355 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2355. Quod animae et spiritus secum in alteram vitam ferant quoque corporea<p>De tactu, odore, seu olfactu, auditu, visu, tum de appertitu, prius, ut reor, dictum videas [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2355/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_818" target=_top>818</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2355/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1243" target=_top>1243</a>]: animae mirantur valde quod sint prorsus [ut] si essent in vita corporis, sic ut nihil dignoscere possint inter vitam eorum in corpore, et post corporis mortem, putantes se esse in corpore; iis dicere dabatur, quod vita corporis non sit corporis, modo quod appareat corporis esse, sed est spiritus vita, quae sentitur in corpore, quare spiritus eam secum ferunt, quia assuefacti corporeis, dum vixerunt in corpore; quod vita spiritus sit, et quod spiritus corpus habeat sicut quoddam operimentum seu instrumentum vivendi super terra, constare potest ex eo, dum in deliquio sunt, quod nullus sensus corporis, tum etiam in somno, quare sensus corporis, non est corporis, sed est spiritus, formatus tamen in corpore secundum formam organorum ejus, et inde perceptionem, cui quia spiritus assuefactus, sensus isti ita remanent. 1748, 18 Junius. </p>
