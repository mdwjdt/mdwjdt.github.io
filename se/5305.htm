<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5305</h4><p>5305. Continuation about the great city between the west and the north, about which on p. 281 [5269 ff.]<p>In the western region subject to that city, or what is the same, to the pope, there were very many monasteries and many of them under the mountain region. The monks there went out to seek souls and put them under their control, which they did at nighttime. When it was discovered that they had intentions like this, all of them were thrown out, some into a northern swamp, others into a dark cave, and others into some quagmire. This happened to each one of them in a moment; it was the same with the rest who were in the city. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5305</h4><p>5305. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE GREAT CITY BETWEEN THE WEST AND THE NORTH, TREATED OF ON P. 361 [no. 5269f]. <p>In the western district subject to that city, or to the Pope, were very many monasteries, chiefly under the mountain-land. The monks, there, went out to seek for souls and subjugate them; which was done at night-time. Then, all in whom such a purpose was discovered, were cast, part into the northern swamp, part into the murky cavern, part into a certain gulf. This happened with everyone in a moment, just as with the rest who were in the city. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5305 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5305. Continuatio de magna urbe inter occidentem et septentrionem, de qua p. 311 [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5305/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_5269" target=_top>5269</a> seqq.]<p>In tractu occidentali, subjecto illi urbi seu papae, erant perplura monasteria pleraque sub terra montana, monachi ibi exiverunt ad quaerendum animas et subjugandas illas, quod factum tempore nocturno, tunc inventi quod in tali intentione, conjecti sunt omnes partim in paludem septentrionalem, partim in tenebrosam cavernam, partim in aliquam voraginem; quod factum cum unoquovis momento, sicut reliquis qui in urbe. </p>
