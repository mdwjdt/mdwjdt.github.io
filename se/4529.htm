<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4529</h4><p>4529. They were shown in many ways that they can be moved, like marionettes, by others, appearing to themselves as marionettes, and they were moved in that manner as to their bodies, arms, hands, feet, hanging on strings from the hands that were moving them; in fact that whole level toward the front was turned into such scenes. They were surprised and displeased, and proclaimed the power of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4529</h4><p>4529. It was shown them in many ways, that they could be moved by others like puppets [marionettes]; they [even] appeared to themselves like puppets, and were moved in like manner as to their bodies, arms, hands, feet, [as if] by means of little hanging strings or threads, pulled by the hand. The whole, the plane in front, was in fact turned into such [magical spirits]. [The beholders] wondered and were indignant, and proclaimed the power of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4529 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4529. Ostensum iis, multis, quod moveri possint sicut marionettes, ab aliis, apparuerunt sibi ut marionettes, et movebantur similiter quoad corpora, brachia, manus, pedes, cum filamentis pendulis ad manus quibus movebantur; imo totum illud planum antrorsum versum est in tales: mirati et indignati sunt, et potentiam Domini praedicabant. </p>
