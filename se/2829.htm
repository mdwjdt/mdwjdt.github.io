<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2829</h4><p>2829. which was communicated to me, I could not get loose. But even though I could not be disentangled in that state, still I was held in the conviction that one should not on that account recede from the truth, which would be just as if one were to recede from an obvious truth right before one's eyes simply because one does not know the causes, or arguments based on causes.<p>But they were informed that the life of the human soul, that is, of the innermost mind and the very inward one is not mankind's, but is the Lord's. These are the minds that receive life and through which perception and sensation are communicated to the earthly mind and to the body. And because mankind and spirits live in their own earthly and bodily element, they think life, which is the Lord's, to be their own-no differently than as they suppose that sight and hearing and touch are the eye's, the ear's, and the body's. There is no need to adduce more examples. For hereby the connection would appear of the innermost with the very inward regions, and of the very inward with the inward ones and thus with the outward, also in the bodily organs, where in their own way the outward parts depend on the very inward and innermost by means of the purest elements in an uninterrupted stream from the very inward and innermost regions. 1748, 15 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2829</h4><p>2829. and inasmuch as [this truth] was confined in the persuasion [of theirs] which was communicated to me. I could not be rescued [extricated], but although I could not in that state be extricated, yet I was held in the persuasion that the truth is not therefore to be receded from, like as if anyone should recede from the plain truth which is before his eyes, because he is not acquainted with causes, or reasonings from causes: But they were informed that the life of the human soul, to wit, of his inmost and more interior mind, is not of man, but is of the Lord. The things of the mind are what receive life, and by these is communicated perception and sensation to the natural and corporeal mind, and inasmuch as man and spirit lives in his natural and corporeal [principle] he thinks life which belongs to the Lord to be his own, just as he supposes that sight and hearing and touch belong to the eye, ear, and body. There is no need of adducing more [facts]: for thus might be presented the connection of inmosts with more interior things, and of more interior with interior things, and so with exteriors; also in the organs of the body, wherein in their manner exteriors depend on more interior and inmost things by most pure [principles] continued from more interior and inmost things. - 1748, August 15. </p>
