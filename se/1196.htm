<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1196</h4><p>1196. He said that he was a Jewish Rabbi, and that he had been in that filthy city for a long time, and he was terribly sad that he should have to dwell so long in a city like that, where the streets one had to walk in are nothing but mud and clay, and no other food is eaten than mud. I asked why, since he was a spirit, he wanted to eat. He said that so it seemed to him, that he wanted to eat, and that then nothing else was offered him but mud; so he was very sorrowful.<p>1196. [1/2]. Consequently, he was asking what he should do, be-cause, he said, he did not find Abraham, nor Isaac nor Jacob-about whom I then told him several particulars. I said he was looking for them in vain, because they can be of no help at all; and some other things about them which are rather secret. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1196</h4><p>1196. He said that he was a Rabbi of the Jews and had been in that filthy city for a long time, and he lamented greatly that he would have to stay so long in such a city, where the streets were nothing but filth and mire wherever one went, and where there was no other food to eat but filth. I asked him why, since he was a spirit, he should desire to eat? He said that it so seemed to him that he desired to eat, and that then nothing else was offered to him but filth, whereat he lamented greatly. <p>1196 1/2. He therefore asked what was to be done, for he said he was unable to find Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob. I told him something about them, and that he would seek them in vain for they would give him no help, besides other things concerning them which are more secret. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1196 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1196. Dicebat quod Rabbinus Judaeorum esset, et quod a longo tempore fuerit in urbe ista coenosa, lamentatus valde, quod tamdiu in tali urbe moraturus esset, ubi plateae <sup>1</sup></p><p>nihil nisi coenum et lutum, ubi eundum, et quod non alio cibo vesceretur, quam coeno; quaerebam, cur, dum spiritus esset, cuperet edere, dicebat, quod ita videatur ei, quod cuperet edere, et quod tunc nihil aliud ei offeratur, quam coenum, quare valde lamentatus.<p>1196a. Quaerebat itaque quid faciendum, quia, dixit, non invenire se Abrahamum, nec Isacum nec Jacobum, de quibus cum aliqua ei dixerim-quod <sup>1</sup></p><p>frustra quaererentur, quia nihil opis ferre possint, et alia, quae arcaniora sunt de iis- <sup>2</sup></p><p>(1197.) dicebam itaque ei, quod nullus alius quaerendus, quam solum Deus Messias, Quem in vita ita contemserant, quod Ipse regat universum tam coelum quam terram, et quod a nullo alio auxilium petendum-quaesivit <sup>3</sup></p><p>sollicite, et aliquoties, ubi est, ut cum Ipso loqui potuisset, dixi, quod ubivis sit, et si cum Ipso loqui vellet, quod inveniatur ubivis loci, ubicunque versaretur, etiam in urbe ista, sed instabat, quod cum Ipso in persona loqui vellet, sed quia suspicabantur spiritus caeteri apud me, dolum, abiit. 1748, 7 Martius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has dixerim, quod<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has iis,<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has petendum, quaesivit </p>
