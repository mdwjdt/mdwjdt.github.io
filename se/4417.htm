<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4417</h4><p>4417. I clearly realized that his interiors were open, and that with many of the Christians who were present, they were closed, which was also told to them, for a passionate envy was ruling against him, together with disbelief. When he saw, while I read the Word, that such holy things were contained, he said that he could not be present, because he felt a holiness in which he could not be. Thus he, who was a gentile, was being inwardly moved, while the Christians were declaring in a loud voice that they could be present - for the reason that they were not at all moved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4417</h4><p>4417. I perceived manifestly that his interiors were opened, while with many of the Christians who were present they were shut, as was also said to them, for there reigned [with them] a cupidity of envy against him, and there were contests of unbelief with him. When he perceived, upon my reading in the Word, that its expressions involved such sacred things, he said that he could not be present, because he perceived a holy principle in which he could not be. Thus, though a gentile, he was affected more interiorly, while the Christians said aloud that they could be present; but this was because they were not all affected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4417 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4417. Percipiebam manifeste, quod interiora ejus aperta essent, et quod plures ex Christianis qui aderant, eis clausa essent, quod etiam illis dictum, nam regnabat cupiditas invidiae contra eum, et quae incredulitatis erant: ille cum percepit, dum in Verbo legi, quod sancta talia involverent, dixit, quod non adesse posset, quia percepit sanctum, in quo non esse posset, ita interius ille, qui fuit gentilis, afficiebatur, cum Christiani aperta voce dicerent, quod ii adesse possent; ex causa quia nihil afficiebantur. </p>
