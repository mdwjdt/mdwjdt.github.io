<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5829</h4><p>5829. were taken out of the world of spirits. נTowards the front others appeared who knew points of doctrine only by memory and did not give any thought to them. These likewise were stripped of their [knowledge], and it was as if only the outermost piece of clothing had been taken away. And they became like the heathen having no religion, and they were hurled together into the quagmire that was in the eastern quarter near the south, where the followers of the dragon are. נThey were all followers of the dragon, both the former and the latter. The latter flowed into the beat of the heart, the former, however, into the breathing. In a word, all people like this live in the world as if devoid of religion since in their entire life they have no thought about the Divine in their willing and acting, thinking and speaking alone do not make religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5829</h4><p>5829. Others appeared towards the front, who only knew doctrinals by memory, and did not think about them at all. These were in like manner despoiled of their [clothes]; and it was as if only the outermost garment was taken away, and they became like heathen, of no religion whatever, and were cast into a gulf which was in the eastern quarter, near to the southern, where the dragonists are. - These were all dragonists, both the former <sup>1</sup>and the latter. <sup>2</sup>The latter ones inflowed into the beating of the heart; but the former into the respiration. In a word, all such live in the world as it were without religion, inasmuch as in their whole life they think nothing about the Divine in the things they will and do. Merely thinking and talking does not constitute religion. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Namely, those treated of in no. 5828. -TR. <p>2.&nbsp;The ones referred to in the early portion of the present no. -TR. </p>

Hi posteriores influebant in pulsum cordis; priores autem in respirationem. Verbo omnes tales vivunt in mundo sicut absque religione, quoniam in tota sua vita nihil cogitant de Divino in volendis et agendis; solum cogitare et loqui non facit religionem. </p>
