<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2394</h4><p>2394. About the intelligence and wisdom of angels<p>The intelligence and wisdom of angels is incredible to earthly humans, because such a thing does not exist in the human race. It consists of the power of knowing, and of discerning, or understanding and becoming wise in limitless subjects that never come, or can come, to the knowledge of people on earth - and if they did, they could not possibly grasp and believe them. It is an ability, when some truth occurs that they had never before heard, to know at once not only its category, but also the kinds and species pertaining to it, which they are able to discern instantaneously in the right order and sequence, and if it pleases the Lord, to set forth.<p>I once heard the like of this from someone, and have several times been allowed to learn it. For example, in the case of some of the deeper secrets regarding members, internal or external, of the body, they discern at once whether and how they fit in, this based on the grand human body. I heard from this angel in fact innumerable details he had never before thought of, but were given to him instantaneously because he is in the light of truths, likewise in spiritual and heavenly and all the other qualities that pertain to faith.<p>In short, the angels' power of understanding and becoming wise, thus their intelligence and wisdom, is of such a nature that if people on earth learned of it, they would be stunned; for the peak of human knowledge hardly reaches their very least, and a single unit of human knowledge becomes an incalculable quantity with an angel. 1748, 23 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2394</h4><p>2394. CONCERNING THE INTELLIGENCE AND WISDOM OF THE ANGELS. <p>The intelligence and wisdom of the angels is incredible to man, because such is not given in the human race. It consists in the faculty of knowing, and perceiving or understanding, and being wise with indefinite things, which never reach nor can come to the knowledges of man; and should they come, men could not receive and believe them. The faculty is of such a sort that when any truth has never been heard of by them before, they immediately know not only what is its quality but also its genera and species of genera, which can be perceived, and if it pleases the Lord, be displayed without premeditation [extempore], in their order and their series; as also I have heard once, and it was given me to know several times, as, for example, if there are any of the more secret things in the internal [and] external members of the human body, they immediately perceive whether and how they agree, and this [they knew] from the Grand Man. Yea, I have heard the differences enumerated by him, concerning which he has never before thought, but it is given him without premeditation [extempore], because he is in the light of truth, likewise in spiritual and celestial things, and everything else that belongs to faith; in a word, their faculty of understanding and being wise; therefore their understanding and wisdom is such that if men knew it they would be amazed: for the greatest endowment of man is scarcely their least, and one thing of man's becomes indefinite with the angels. - 1748, June 23. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2394 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2394. De intelligentia et sapientia angelorum<p>Intelligentia et sapientia angelorum est homini incredibilis, quia talis non datur in genere humano, consistit in facultate sciendi, percipiendique, seu intelligendi sapiendique indefinita, quae nusquam ad cognitiones hominis perveniunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>, aut venire possint <sup>2</sup></p><p>, et si venirent, non possent capere et credere; facultas est talis, ut dum aliqua veritas nusquam prius audita iis, illico sciant <sup>3</sup></p><p>, non modo qualis est, sed etiam quae ejus genera et generum species, quae ex tempore, suo ordine, et sua serie possunt percipi, et Domino beneplacente exponi, sicut semel quoque [a quodam] audivi, et aliquoties scire mihi datum, ut pro exemplo, si aliqua arcaniora in corporis <sup>4</sup></p><p>humani membris, internis, externis, percipiunt illico num et quomodo conveniunt, et quidem ex maximo homine, imo differentias enumeratas ab eo audivi, de quibus is nusquam prius cogitavit, sed ex tempore ei datur, quia in luce veritatum est, similiter in spiritualibus et coelestibus, ac omnibus aliis, quae sunt fidei, verbo, intelligendi et sapiendi eorum facultas, proinde intelligentia et sapientia talis est, ut si nossent homines, obstupescerent, nam summum hominis, est vix minimum eorum, ac unum hominis fit indefinitum apud angelum. 1748, 23 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
