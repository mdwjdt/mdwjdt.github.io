<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4914</h4><p>4914. But there are many kinds of them. They are seen on high at the right and left of the sun, where the Lord is, and they pour out an aura from themselves as if it were from the Lord, because they believed that they were His vicars. Thus from on high they view those who are below and govern them. And they do not tolerate them lifting a finger against them or saying anything to them that does not please them, not even looking at them from reverence for them as representatives of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4914</h4><p>4914. But there are many kinds of these. They appear on an eminence on the right and left side of the sun where the Lord is, and diffuse from themselves a sphere as if it were from the Lord - for they believed that they were His vicars. They thus scrutinize from on high those who are below, and rule them; neither will they endure that they utter a sound against them, nor say to them anything that is not pleasing, nor even that they look at them - out of reverence to their being in the stead of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4914 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4914. Sed sunt [qui] ex illis plurium generum, apparent in edito a latere dextro et sinistro solis, ubi Dominus, et effundunt ex se sphaeram sicut esset a Domino, nam quod ejus vicarii fuerint crediderunt, ita perspiciunt ex alto illos qui infra sunt, et illos regunt, nec tolerant ut hiscant contra illos, aut aliquid dicant illis quod iis non placet, ne quidem quod intueantur in illos propter reverentiam quod vice Domini sint. </p>
