<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1996</h4><p>1996. About music, and its effect on spirits<p>It has happened twice that I heard the music of stringed instruments, viol och hakbrade, <sup>1</sup>on the street, which so soothed the spirits that they could hardly tell they were not in heaven. It cheered them so that they were swept almost beyond themselves with joy. I felt their joy, and it was great, and now even as I am writing these words, there is music of fiddles, and the plucking of strings continues, and because of it they are so changed that they are hardly the same spirits.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "violin and harp." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1996</h4><p>1996. (CONCERNING MUSIC - WHAT KIND OF EFFECT IT PRODUCES UPON SPIRITS. <p>It has twice happened that I have heard in the streets music from stringed instruments [viol och hakbrade, i.e. violin and harp], which so soothed the spirits that they scarcely knew but that they were in heaven, for they were exhilarated to such a degree as to be, as it were, transported out of themselves. I perceived their delight, which was abundant; and even now, while I write, that music of strings and pulsatile chords is continued. The spirits are so changed by it that they seem scarcely the same. </p>

De musica, qualem effectum in spiritus habeat<p>Bis contigit, quod audiverim musicam ex instrumentis chordarum, viol, och hakbrade {a}, in platea, quae ita mulcebat <sup>1</sup></p><p>spiritus, ut vix scirent aliter ac essent in coelo, nam exhilarati sunt, ut quasi extra se rapti, eorum gaudium sensi, quod multum erat; nunc quoque cum haec scribo, musica ista fidium, et pulstatilis chordarum, continuatur, ex ea sic alterantur, ut vix sint iidem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has mulciebat </p>
