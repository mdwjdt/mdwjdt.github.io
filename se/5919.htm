<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5919</h4><p>5919. About the Lord in the case of Africans<p>The Africans to whom there is revelation do not know as regards the Lord that He was born as a human being, but they do know that God is human, and they say that He Himself created man. After hearing this, I was granted to speak with Africans, to whom it was said that it is a truth that Jehovah Himself created Man, because from his own Power He had made His Human Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5919</h4><p>5919. THE LORD [AS CONCEIVED] AMONG THE AFRICANS. <p>The Africans with whom there is a revelation, do not know, respecting the Lord, that He was born a man; but they know that God is a man, and say that He Himself created Himself Man. On hearing this, it was granted me to talk with Africans; to whom it was stated, that it is true that Jehovah Himself created Himself Man, because from His own proper Power, He had made His Human Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5919 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5919. De Domino apud Africanos<p>Africani apud quos revelatio non sciunt de Domino quod natus homo, sed sciunt quod Deus sit homo, et dicunt quod Ipse SeIpsum creaverit hominem, hoc audito loqui dabatur cum Africanis, quibus dictum quod id verum sit, quod Jehovah SeIpsum creaverit Hominem, quia ex propria Potentia Humanum Suum Divinum fecerat. </p>
