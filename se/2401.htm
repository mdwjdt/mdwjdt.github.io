<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2401</h4><p>2401. The spirits with a person on earth know all things in the person, and possess them as their own<p>This is clear from innumerable instances, but the spirits do not know it, thinking the things are their own and that they have them from their own memory. So that I might learn this even better, I read the Hebrew language to some who had never understood a word of that language, but also first to some little children. They knew the language as well as I did: what I had learned, they knew as if they had learned it themselves, whereupon, given reflection, they acknowledged that it was so. 1748, 24 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2401</h4><p>2401. THAT THE SPIRITS WITH A MAN KNOW EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO THE MAN, AND POSSESS THEM AS THEIR OWN. <p>This is evident from innumerable things, but spirits are ignorant of this: they think these things to be their own, and derived from their own memory; such is the fallacy of sense. In order that I might know it still better, I read the Hebrew tongue before such as never have understood the least word [verbulum] of that tongue, as I also had previously done before infants. They knew the language as well as I; what I have learned they are aware of as if they had known it. When reflection was granted them touching this, they acknowledged that the matter stands so. - 1748, June 24. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2401 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2401. Quod spiritus penes hominem, omnia quae hominis sunt, sciant, possideantque sicut sua<p>Ex innumeris hoc constat, sed hoc nesciunt spiritus, putant esse sua, et ex suamet memoria id habere, talis est fallacia sensus; ut id scirem adhuc melius, legi linguam Hebraicam coram iis, qui nusquam intellexerunt verbulum ejus linguae, tum etiam prius coram infantibus; illi sciebant linguam istam sicut ego, quod didici id norunt tanquam nossent ii, ad quod cum data iis reflexio, agnoscebant, quod ita se habeat. 1748, 24 Junius. </p>
