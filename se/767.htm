<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 767</h4><p>767. How the different sciences take hold of the human mind, and limit it<p>I was talking with spirits about the different sciences, such as philosophy, and others - how they develop human minds.<p>As for philosophy, every aspect of it up until now has done nothing but cast shadows over minds, and thus has closed off the way to a contemplation of deeper matters, as well as of universal principles, for it consists solely of terms, and of disputes about them - even more so does rationalistic philosophy, which constricts ideas in such a way that the mind dwells upon nothing but petty details and consequently on trivia. Besides, it not only obstructs the channels to what is deeper, but also causes blindness, and completely banishes belief. Therefore, in the other life, a philosopher who had clung fast to such details and given himself up to them, is now stupid, and by far less knowledgeable than others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 767</h4><p>767. CONCERNING THE VARIOUS SCIENCES, HOW THEY TAKE HOLD OF AND QUALIFY THE HUMAN MIND <p>I was conversing with spirits about how the various sciences, such as philosophy and other sciences, form human minds. As regards philosophy, every phase of this subject has hitherto done nothing else than darken minds, and so has closed the way to the intuition of interior things and also of universals, for it consists of terms alone, and of disputes concerning them. Contrary to a rational philosophy, it so constrains ideas that the mind sticks fast only in particulars, and thus in dust. Besides which it not only obstructs the way to things interior, but also blinds [the mind] and entirely takes away faith. Therefore, in the other life a philosopher who has cleaved so much to such things and indulged in them, is stupid, and less learned than others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 767 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>767. De scientiis variis quomodo mentem humanam occupant et qualificant<p>Cum spiritibus eram in sermone de variis scientiis, quomodo mentes humanas formant, sicut de philosophia, et de aliis. Quod philosophiam attinet, quaecunque ejus pars hactenus non aliud fecit, quam quod adumbraverit mentes, et sic clauserit viam ad intuitionem interiorum, tum etiam universalium, nam in solis terminis, et de iis, litibus consistit, praeter rationalem philosophiam, quae ita coarctat ideas, ut mens nihil haereat nisi in particularibus, et sic in pulvere; praeter quod non solum obstruat vias ad interiora, sed etiam occoecat, et fidem prorsus adimit, sic ut philosophus in altera vita, qui <sup>1</sup></p><p>multum similibus inhaesit, seu indulsit, sit stupidus, et prae aliis indoctissimus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
