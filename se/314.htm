<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>314.天堂的幸福是无法形容的，体验过天堂喜乐的世人，其最深的幸福也无法与天使最小的幸福相提并论。今天，许多在天堂里的人渴望知道何为天堂的喜乐。因此，蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，他们被恩准尽可能地感受天堂的喜乐，直到他们再也无法承受。事实上，它们具有多样化的性质，以致一个人的喜乐虽达到他的至内层，如他也承认的，但仍不如某些人所拥有的天堂喜乐大。他们从这次经历得以知道天堂的幸福何等之大，天堂的喜乐是何性质，因为这些灵人至内在的喜乐甚至不及天使最小的喜乐。蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，我被恩准在自己里面感受其中一些人至内在的喜乐，由此得以知道他们至内在的喜乐是属次等的喜乐。奇妙的是，一个灵人至内在的喜乐被他宣称为至高并且最属天的，而实际上无非是寒冷，我同样被允许明显感受到这种寒冷。为叫他们能承受这些天堂喜乐（如他们所以为的，因为它们是其至内在的喜乐），弥赛亚神规定，他们要被一个天使气场所围绕，免得他们灭亡并消散。（1747年12月7日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 314</h4><p>314. Heavenly happiness is ineffable, and the very deepest happiness of a person on earth experiencing heavenly joy, does not equal even the least happiness of the angels<p>Today a number of those who were in heaven were longing to learn what heavenly joy is, and it was therefore granted them, by the mercy of God the Messiah, to feel heavenly joy to the deepest degree possible for them - even to the degree where they could not bear any more. They were actually of diverse character, so that the joy of one of them reached its deepest level (as he also acknowledged), but still was not as great a heavenly joy as some had.<p>From this experience they were allowed to learn how great heavenly happiness is, and what heavenly joy is like, since their very deepest did not even come up to the least of the angels.<p>What the deepest joy of some of them was like, it was granted me by the mercy of God the Messiah to feel in myself and thereby, to learn that those joys that were their deepest, were among the lesser joys. And what is amazing, the deepest joy of one of them, who declared it to be the very highest and the most heavenly, was actually nothing but coldness, which I was likewise allowed to feel plainly.<p>So that they could bear those heavenly joys (as they supposed them to be, because they were their deepest ones), it had been provided by God the Messiah that they should be surrounded by an angelic field, lest they perish, and be dissolved. 1747, the 7th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 314</h4><p>314. THAT HEAVENLY HAPPINESS IS INEFFABLE, AND THAT THE INMOST HAPPINESS OF MAN WHEN IN HEAVENLY JOY, DOES NOT ANSWER EVEN TO THE LEAST HAPPINESS OF THE ANGELS <p>Today, some of those who were in heaven were desirous of knowing what heavenly joy is. It was therefore also granted them, by the mercy of God Messiah, to feel the heavenly joy to their inmost degree, even to such an extent that they could bear no more. They were indeed of a diverse nature, so much so that although the joy of one reached to his inmost - as he also acknowledged - still it was not such a heavenly joy as others felt. From this it was granted me to know how great is the happiness, and of what quality is heavenly joy, since the inmost joy of those spirits was not even as the least of that of the angels. It was granted me, by the mercy of God Messiah, to feel in myself the quality of the inmost joy of some. Hence it was given me to know that their inmost joys were among the lesser joys; and what is wonderful, the inmost of one spirit, which he declared to be supreme and most heavenly, was then nothing but cold, which was also granted me manifestly to feel. In order that they might be able to sustain those heavenly joys as they supposed them to be, because they were their inmost, it was provided by God Messiah that they should be encompassed by a sphere of angels, lest they should perish and be dissolved. 1747, Dec. 7. </p>

Quod felicitas coelestis sit ineffabilis, et quod intima felicitas hominis, dum in coelesti gaudio est, ne quidemrespondeat minimae felicitati angelorum<p>Hodie aliquot ex iis, qui in coelo erant, desiderabant cognoscere, quid gaudium coeleste, ideo etiam ex misericordia Dei Messiae, iis concessum est sentire gaudium coeleste, ad intimum eorum gradum, usque ad eum, ut non plus sustinere possent, et quidem erant ex diversa indole, adeo ut gaudium unius ad intimum ejus perveniret, sicut etiam agnoscebat, sed usque non erat gaudium coeleste, quale erat aliquibus; inde scire concessum est, quanta felicitas, et quale gaudium coeleste est, quum intimum eorum ne quidem esset sicut minimum angelorum; quale erat quorundam gaudium intimum, ex misericordia Dei Messiae, in me sentire concedebatur, inde dabatur cognoscere quod inter minora gaudia essent, quae eorum essent intimum, et quod mirabile est, unius intimum, quod fatebatur supremum esse, et coelestissimum, tunc non erat nisi frigus, quod sentire manifeste mihi quoque <sup>1</sup></p><p>concedebatur; ut sustinere possent coelestia illa gaudia, ut autumabant, quia intima eorum erant, provisum erat a Deo Messia, quod angelorum sphaera circumcingerentur, ne perirent, et dissolverentur. 1747, die 7 Dec.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
