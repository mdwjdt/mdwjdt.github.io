<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4998</h4><p>4998. He also had some others behind who directed those who were there, for the case in the other life is that those who are behind and make treacherous attacks are those who secretly had done so in the world.<p>He was punished by one who was like this who also rushed on him from behind and likewise held him bound and by whom he was also attacked. But he was in turn freed by his own people. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4998</h4><p>4998. He also had some others at the back, who directed those who were there; for it is so, in the other life, that they are at the back and lie in wait, who lay in wait secretly in the world. He was punished by one of such a character, who, also, put himself at his back and held him bound in a similar manner. He was likewise infested by him, but was, in his turn, liberated by his associates. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4998 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4998. Habebat etiam aliquos a tergo alios qui dirigerent illos qui ibi, nam ita se habet in altera vita, qui a tergo sunt et insidiantur, sunt qui in occulto insidiati sunt in mundo. Punitus est per talem qui etiam se ingerebat ei a tergo, et similiter tenebat illum vinctum, quo etiam infestatus est, sed a suis liberatus est ad vices. </p>
