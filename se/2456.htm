<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2456</h4><p>2456. For in body they are used to pretending, to displaying different behaviors, different tones of voice, and different facial expressions than they are thinking. So it is clear that inward things do exist, which can be in disagreement with outward or bodily ones. When the spirit heard this, he acknowledged that it was so, but I guess he had never expended reflection on such matters.<p>There are very many considerations from which one can learn such things, if one reflects and acknowledges as a truth that there is an inward person different from the outward one, but because people are only interested in the body, they care nothing for them. 1748, 30 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2456</h4><p>2456. For they are accustomed to feign in the body, other actions, other words, and put forward other countenances than agree with their thought [quam qualiter cogitant]. Wherefore it is clear that interiors are given which can disagree with exteriors or corporeals; when the spirit heard that, he acknowledged that it is so, but I think he had never exercised reflection about such things. There are very many such things if man reflects and acknowledges for truth, that there is an interior man which is different from the exterior; from which he may know such things; but because he studies the body only he cares [curant for curat, I think] nothing for such things. - 1748, June 30. </p>
