<p>387.有些污秽肮脏的小动物攻击并折磨他们。一切由肉体的爱和不正当的爱所产生的幻想都有令人恶心、污秽、肮脏、可怕、恶臭的动物，以及类似动物为同伴，或与它们同在；当灵人陷入由他们的情欲或快感所激起，并且他们在其中找到最大乐趣的幻想时，这些动物就呈现在他们面前。因此，他们的乐趣与这类恐怖生物交织在一起。这些昆虫的种类为数众多，数量无法确定。我曾看见所展示的其中一部分；但它们数不胜数。每一种都照着其幻想与爱或动机的混杂而构成，所有幻想都不可避免地伴随着过着颠倒生活的属世人。因此，一个最可怕的地狱从他们的享受中产生；因为这类享受中的快乐感觉有多大，那么当他们以之为属天堂的世俗和肉体享受转化为地狱般的享受时，所产生的痛苦和恐怖的感觉就有多大。（1747年12月24日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 387</h4><p>387. There are filthy and foul little animals that attack and torture them<p>All fantasies that occur because of a forbidden love of the body or mind, have as a companion, or along with them, animals that are offensive, filthy, foul, frightening, stinking, etc., with which spirits are confronted while engaged in their forbidden fantasies aroused by their passions and pleasures, in which they find the most intense enjoyment. As a result, their enjoyments are intermixed with such horror-provoking creatures.<p>The species of such insects are countlessly many. I have seen some of them displayed, but they are innumerable. Each species is fashioned to image some mixture of fantasies with loves or motives - the fantasies that inevitably follow and accompany earthly-minded persons, who live their life upside-down. From their enjoyments results a most dreadful hell; for as great as the feeling of pleasure in such enjoyments is, so great is the feeling of pain, and of fright, that arises when their worldly and bodily [enjoyments], which they imagine to be heavenly, are turned into hellish ones. 1747, the 24th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 387</h4><p>387. THAT THERE ARE FOUL AND FILTHY LITTLE ANIMALS WITH WHICH THEY ARE INFESTED AND TORMENTED <p>All phantasies which are produced from the love of the body and from illicit love leave with themselves as a companion, nasty, foul, filthy, horrid, stinking, and the like animals, which present themselves before them when they are in those illicit phantasies which their cupidities or pleasures instigate, and in which they perceive their greatest delight: thus their delights are mingled with such things as strike horror. The species of these insects are indefinite in number, a part of which I saw represented; but they are innumerable, composed according to the co-mingling of the phantasies with their loves or ends, all which infallibly follow and accompany natural men who live in an inverted order of life. Thus a most dreadful hell is produced from their pleasures: for to the extent that there is a sense of delight in such pleasures, to that extent there comes into existence a sense of pain and horror when their worldly and corporeal things, which they suppose to be heavenly, are turned into things infernal. 1747, Dec. 24. </p>
