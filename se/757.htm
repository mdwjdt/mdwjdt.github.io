<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 757</h4><p>757. About the circle to the understanding, and thence, through the will into actions<p>There is an obvious circle starting with the senses - especially the hearing and sight, which present objects that arouse inner sensation - to the understanding, and from the understanding into the will, then from the will into action, either of the mouth, i.e. speech, or of the face, or of the bodily members. This is the natural circle.<p>But because [human] nature has been corrupted, so that objects can only pass from the senses to the understanding, but not into the will, because this is being controlled from a different source, therefore there must be a process of regeneration whereby the true order, or circle, is restored. Then, finally, the will holds full sway, and from it, the understanding, both striving together for the fruits of charity. Then all evil that is slipped in by evil spirits is turned into good in the understanding. For the Lord, through the will, that is, through love, and mercy, which is His alone, is guiding the person whom He has regenerated and gifted with these abilities. 1748, 12 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 757</h4><p>757. CONCERNING THE CIRCLE TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND THENCE THROUGH THE WILL INTO ACTIONS <p>There is a manifest circle from the senses, especially from the hearing and sight which present objects that arouse internal sensation; thus it proceeds to the understanding, and from the understanding into the will, and from the will into act, either of the mouth or speech, or of the face, or of the members of the body, such is the natural circle. But because [this order of] nature has been destroyed, so that objects can only pass from the senses into the understanding, but not into the will - for this is governed from another fount - therefore there must be regeneration by which the true order, or the circle, is restored. Then at length the will, and hence the understanding, may hold all things, and each conspires to [produce] the fruits of charity. Thus every evil that is insinuated by evil spirits is turned into good in the understanding; for the Lord by the will, that is by love and mercy which are His alone, directs the man whom He has regenerated and endowed with those faculties. 1748, Feb. 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 757 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>757. De circulo ad intellectum, et inde per voluntatem, in actiones<p>Circulus datur manifestus a sensibus, cumprimis ab auditu et visu, qui objecta sistunt, quae excitant sensum internum, ita ad intellectum, et ab intellectu in voluntatem, ac a voluntate in actum, sive oris seu loquelae, sive faciei, sive membrorum, talis est circulus naturalis, sed quia natura est perdita, ut modo a sensibus in intellectum transire objecta possunt, sed non in voluntatem, quia haec regitur ab alio fonte, ideo [erit] regeneratio, qua restituitur ordo verus, seu circulus, tandem ut voluntas omne teneat, et inde intellectus, sic utrumque conspirat ad fructus charitatis, sic omne malum quod insinuatur a spiritibus malis vertitur in bonum in intellectu, nam Dominus per voluntatem, hoc est per amorem, et misericordiam, quae sola Ipsius est, dirigit hominem, quem regeneravit, ac [cui] facultates istas donavit. 1748, 12 Febr. </p>
