<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4170</h4><p>4170. About what is lukewarm<p>That lukewarm water causes vomiting is due to the fact that lukewarm spiritual qualities are of that nature - for spiritual things have that effect upon earthly ones. This was mentioned to spirits and angels, and they acknowledged it. When I was thinking about lukewarm water, and at the same time of the lukewarm spiritual quality, there were spirits present who seemed as if they were vomiting. From this the nature of [spiritual] inflow may be seen. 1749, 12 March. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of the sun, meaning Sunday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4170</h4><p>4170. CONCERNING LUKEWARM THINGS.<p>The reason that lukewarm water causes vomiting is, that lukewarm spiritual things are of the same quality; for spiritual things have such an effect upon natural things, which was remarked to spirits and angels, and they confessed that it was so. When I was thinking of lukewarm water, and at the same time of spiritual lukewarmness, there were spirits present who seemed, as it were, to vomit, from which the nature of the influx may be perceived. - 1749, March 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4170 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4170. De tepidis<p>Quod aqua tepida vomitum faciat, causam trahit ab eo quod tepida spiritualia talia sint, nam spiritualia talem effectum habent in naturalia, quod dictum est spiritibus, et angelis, et agnoverunt; cum cogitarem de aqua tepida, et simul de tepido spirituali, spiritus erant, qui quasi evomere videbantur; inde qualis influxus sit constare potest. 1749, 12 Martius. </p>
