<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4104</h4><p>4104. Concerning love<p>I realized that to those who in bodily life love the neighbor as themselves, it is granted in the other life to love the neighbor more than themselves, for the good qualities of love are immeasurably increased; and bodily life is such that one cannot progress beyond loving the neighbor as oneself, being engrossed in bodily concerns. But when these have died out, then love is more pure, and finally becomes angelic love, which is to love others more than oneself. 1748, 30 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4104</h4><p>4104. CONCERNING LOVE.<p>It was perceived that to him who, in the life of the body, loves his neighbor as himself, it is given in the other life to love his neighbor better than himself, for the goods of love are then indefinitely increased. Such is the life of the body, that one cannot go beyond the point of loving his neighbor as himself, because he is in corporeals, but with those who have passed out of this life, the love is more pure and becomes at length angelic, and this is to love others more than one's self. - 1748, November 30. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4104 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4104. De amore<p>Perceptum, quod in vita corporis, qui amat proximum sicut semet, ei detur in altera vita amare proximum plus quam semet, nam amoris bona indefinite augentur; et talis est vita corporea, ut non ultra quam amare proximum sicut semet, progredi possit, quia in corporeis, at iis mortuis, tunc amor magis purus est, qui tandem fit angelicus, qui est amare alios plus quam semet. 1748, 30 Nov. </p>
