<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>299.我也蒙弥赛亚神的怜悯，在祂的直接奇迹般的眷顾之下，被提升到更内层天堂的一个居所。我能呆一会儿，同时与天使交谈；他们极其敏锐地发觉有人在场。因为他们以新来者为最大快乐，对新来者成为他们当中的一员抱有最热切的渴望。不过，凭这种敏锐的觉知，他们立刻就知道并感觉那人能否住在他们当中。如若不能，他们就会很难过，但仍竭尽全力引导这个灵魂；但当达不成一致时，他们就会让自己分开。于是，这个灵魂又可以坐上马车被送到别处；我不仅听见，还看见这一切；我经常与他们详谈，不仅在车里，后来也与他们交谈。从那些住在内层天堂和更内层天堂的人可以看出，那些在肉身生命结束后立即被提升的人是何情形，即“他们走遍干旱之地，寻求安歇”（马太福音12:43;路加福音11:24）。（1747年12月5日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 299</h4><p>299. I was raised up also into a habitation of the very inward heaven where, by the mercy, and under the direct and miraculous auspices of God the Messiah, I was able to abide for a while, and at the same time speak with the angels, who sensed most sharply that someone was present. For they are extremely happy about newcomers, and want most eagerly for a newcomer to become one of them. But from that keen perception, they at once know and sense whether that person is able to live among them. If not, they are sad, and still make every effort to initiate the soul, but when there is not concord, they separate themselves. Then the soul is again allowed to be transported around in carriages, which I have not only heard, but also seen; and I have been with them in the carriages, and afterwards conversed with them at some length.<p>From these circumstances in the inward and very inward heaven, one can see how things are with those who are quickened immediately after the life of the body, namely, that "they walk through dry places, and seek rest" [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matt. 12:43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_24.htm">Luke 11:24</a>]. 1747, the 5th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 299</h4><p>299. I was also raised up into a habitation of the more interior heaven, where by the mercy and the immediate and miraculous auspices of God Messiah I could remain for a little while and at the same time speak with the angels, who very exquisitely perceived that there was someone present, for they are in the highest degree delighted with a newcomer, and most earnestly desire that he should be associated with them; but from that exquisite perception they at once know and perceive whether he is such that he can be amongst them. If he is not such, they are grieved, but still they labor with the utmost zeal to initiate him; but when there is no agreement they then separate themselves, so the soul is again allowed to be carried about, as in vehicles. I have not only heard but have also perceived this, and I have quite often talked with them, both when they were in the vehicles, and afterwards. From those who were in the interior and the more interior heaven it can be evident how the case is with those who are raised up immediately after the life of the body, namely, that "they walk through dry places and seek quiet".

Sublatus sum etiam in mansionem intimioris coeli, ubi ex misericordia et auspicio immediato ac miraculoso Dei Messiae, aliquantisper subsistere potui, et simul loqui cum angelis, qui quam exquisite percipiebant, quod quidam adesset, nam de novis advenis summopere laetantur, et summo studio volunt, ut associari possit, sed ex perceptione ista exquisita, illico norunt et percipiunt, num talis sit, ut interesse possit, si non, dolent <sup>1</sup></p><p>, usque summo studio allaborant eum initiare, sed quum non concordia, tunc se separant <sup>2</sup></p><p>; ita iterum datur animae transferri sicut in vehiculis circumcirca, quod non solum audivi sed etiam percepi, et cum iisdem in vehiculis, et postmodum multum satis loquutus sum.
