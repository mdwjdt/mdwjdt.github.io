<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5060</h4><p>5060. Continuation about cities and societies in the other [life] and about the last judgment<p>About Mohammedans<p>In crossing over I also spoke with those who were on two mountains where there were Mohammedans, and I sensed that those who were there lived more harmoniously among themselves than Christians did. Those on the first mountain of them said that they lived correctly because they were law-abiding and obeyed their magistrate, which was perceived indeed to be true, and that for this reason they were kept safe. They were also better than most Christians as regards intelligence.<p>5062. <sup>1</sup>Those there who had had been the firstborn males of Christians, who had been enjoined by law to become Janissaries and thus Mohammedans, said that at heart they were still Christian, but part of these were halfway so.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Following the author's instruction 5062 is inserted after 5060. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5060</h4><p>5060. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE CITIES AND SOCIETIES IN THE OTHER [LIFE], AND CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.<p>In passing over, I also spoke with those who are upon the two mountains where the Mohammedans were; and I perceived that they who were there lived more harmoniously than the Christians in their [abodes]. In their first mountain, they said that they live well, because they readily submit themselves to, and obey, their magistrate - which was also perceived to be true and that, on this account, they are preserved in safety. They were also better than most Christians as to the understanding. </p>
