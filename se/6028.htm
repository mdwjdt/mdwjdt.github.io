<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6028</h4><p>6028. STATE OF C[HARLES] XII., ALSO L[ARS] AND J[ACOB] BENZ[ELIUS], <sup>1</sup>R. LAGERB[ERG]. <sup>2</sup><p>(1.) C[harles] XII - was a most profoundly evil man, and diametrically opposed to the Divine; which being discovered he was at length cast down into the extremity of the west, and let down very deep. He became wholly as it were bony. <p>(2.) L[ars] and J[acob] Benz[elius] were both such as could receive nothing of the Divine, but only the extreme efforts from hell. They were at length cast down into the west, deeply among the devils. <p>(3.) R. Lagerb[erg] was, as it were, destitute of life, appearing as if half-dead; and there was, as it were, a winged beast round about, which held him in check. For the reason that he had denied the Divine, as it were a living thought concerning the Divine was inspired in him, which he received well, and fully understood. Thus he became alive; and thus he was instructed that they who acknowledge the Divine have life. I am unaware of his subsequent lot. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;These were two brothers. The former, Lars, was ennobled in 1719, and his name modified into Benzelstjerna, by which surname he is usually referred to in the Diary [now called Spiritual Experiences]. He was also a fellow Assessor of Swedenborg at the "College of Mines," from 1722-44, at which latter date he was made "Councillor of Mines." He died in 1755. Jacob, at the time of his death in 1747, was Archbishop (cfr. n, <a href="../se/6033.htm">6033</a>, below) of Upsal. Each married one of Swedenborg's sisters. -TR. <p>2.&nbsp;This person is identified both by Dr. R. L. Tafel, in his Documents concerning Swedenborg (vol. i., p. 683-4), and by Dr. Achatius Kahl, in his Narratiunculae, as Count Sven Lagerberg, who followed Charles XII as lieutenant and captain in the Russian campaign. -TR. </p>

XII intime malus et e diametro contra Divinum, quae detecta, tandem in ultimum occidentis dejectus, et profundissime demissus, factus est totus sicut osseus.<p>2) L. et J.
