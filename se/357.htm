<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>357.那些尚未加入的灵人被一种河流般的力量催促，或仿佛被河流带走，好使他们加入其他灵人之列。因此，河流表示属灵之物。我还发现，仍是新手，还不习惯与其他灵人一起行动的灵人被卷入今天所说的属灵河流（参看356节）。今天，我发现这些灵人的不情愿，他们被迫加入他们当中，被一点点地拉向内在区域，然后随着他们变得习惯，就自动加入。最终，在越来越主动之后，他们就能以几乎同样的方式在他们当中流动。但我怀疑他们能否与其他人一起说话和赞美，因为他们仍处于一种被迫状态，即便不得不说一些类似的话，他们仍无法怀着类似那些完全没有意识到自己在照着这种形式流动，并以这种方式说话和赞美之人的快乐而如此行；这种赞美是自发而来的，没有任何东西打断与这种形式一致的溪流。（1747年12月16日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 357</h4><p>357. Those spirits who have not yet been initiated are urged on by a certain force as of a river, to join in, or they are carried along as by a river; hence a river symbolizes what is spiritual<p>I have also watched still novitiate spirits, who were not yet accustomed [to the afterlife], swept into the spiritual river spoken of today on the previous page [<a href="356.htm">356</a>]. I observed the resistance of those spirits, but still they were forced to join in and were drawn little by little toward the inward regions, and then as they became conditioned, they joined in voluntarily. At length, after being more and more initiated, they were able to flow with them in almost the same manner; but I doubt whether they were able to speak and to praise along with the others, because they are still in a compelled state, and even if they were obliged to speak alike, still they could not do so with the same pleasure as those who are completely unaware that they are flowing, and speaking and praising, in that pattern - the praise coming spontaneously, in an uninterrupted stream, in accord with the pattern. 1747, the 16th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 357</h4><p>357. THAT THE SPIRITS WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN INITIATED, ARE URGED ON BY A KIND OF FORCE AS OF A RIVER, OR ARE CARRIED AWAY AS BY A RIVER, THAT THEY MAY BE AMONG [OTHERS]. mHence a river signifies what is spiritual.n <p>I have also observed that spirits who are still novitiates, and not yet accustomed [to act with the others], are also carried away into a spiritual stream, (concerning which see page v). Today I observed the reluctance of those spirits, but nevertheless they were compelled to be among them and were drawn down by little towards the interiors, and thus spontaneously as they acquired the habit. At length being more and more initiated, they could flow among them almost in like manner. But I doubt whether they could speak and praise together, for they are as yet in a state of compulsion, and although they were obliged to speak the same thing, still it could not be with a delight like that of those who do not even know that they are flowing according to that form, and speaking and praising in this manner; this praise comes spontaneously, nothing interrupting the stream according to its form. 1747, Dec. 16. </p>
