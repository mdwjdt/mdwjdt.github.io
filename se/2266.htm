<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2266</h4><p>2266. They likewise see how societies of spirits operate in their mental imagery, communicating to them their own, thus [showing] what kind of societies of spirits there are in that state. I too was enabled to discern this, though faintly. When the thoughts of many societies streamed into one mental image or deeper knowledge of some matter, I was inspired to discern the difference of opinions in general, and therefore what the little world of spirits that surrounded me at the time was like.<p>Angels can see this more clearly, which shows what wisdom those may attain who have faith in the Lord, and that in the other life, even spirits of lesser genius know more than an earthly human can know and discern if he or she should live a thousand years. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2266</h4><p>2266. In like manner how it is with the societies of spirits, which operate into their ideas and communicate theirs therewith, thus of what quality are the societies of spirits in that state; this was also given me to know, though obscurely. When the cogitations [cogitata] of many societies flowed into one idea, or notion [cognitio] of a thing, then was it given to know of what quality was the difference of opinions generically [in genera], thus of what quality was the world of spirits who were then around me. The angels can perceive this more clearly: hence may be apparent in what wisdom they can be who have faith in the Lord, and that in the other life they know, even spirits of lesser genius, more than man can know [scire et nosse] if he should live a thousand years. - 1748 June 10. </p>

Similiter quomodo se habent societates spirituum, quae in ideas eorum operantur, et suas cum iis communicant, ita quales <sup>1</sup></p><p>, in eo statu, societates spirituum sunt, hoc quoque mihi dabatur cognoscere, tametsi obscure: cum influerent cogitata plurium societatum in unam ideam, seu cognitionem rei, tunc nosse dabatur, qualis esset differentia opinionum in genere, ita qualis erat mundulus spirituum, qui tunc circum me; hoc angeli possunt clarius percipere; inde constare potest, qua sapientia possunt esse, qui fidem in Dominum habent, et quod in altera vita sciant, etiam spiritus minoris genii, plura quam homo possit, si mille annos viveret, scire, et nosse. 1748, 10 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
