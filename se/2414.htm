<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2414</h4><p>2414. About the Hebrew Language<p>I have learned from angels that the Hebrew Language is of such a nature that one must pay attention to the sense of the letter, and not so much to the letter. This is confirmed by many considerations, for which reason also it was written in the beginning without points. When thus read, without points, then only the sense was heeded, and from this vocalic intonations developed, as anyone with expertise in that language would know. If one reads it in the Word without points, then unless one is following the sense, one can never know what meaning is in those words, especially in the prophets. The vowels and the like that have been attached thrust the meaning down to the letter.<p>Now if several read the same prophetical books without points, they would develop many senses from them, and if they had attached vowels, each according to his own meaning, then the letters would have been marked differently by each one, and wherever they could not so mark them according to their meaning, they would have sought for anomalies in the words so as to be able still to fashion the word according to their own sense. For the language is of that nature that many anomalies do occur.<p>So it seems to have been allowed later, in view of the prevalent state of human minds, to attach points lest the readers distort the meaning each according to their own fantasy, that is, while living in the body. So it seems that the points were afterwards allowed to be attached, lest readers corrupt the meaning in various ways, each according to their own whim. Whether the points were Divinely inspired can be found out to an extent from the prophetical writings, where the meaning is understood by no one except the Lord, and those to whom it pleases the Lord to reveal it. 1748, 27 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2414</h4><p>2414. CONCERNING THE HEBREW LANGUAGE. <p>I have learned from angels that the Hebrew language is of such a character that only the sense of the letter should be attended to, and not the letter; this is confirmed by many things; wherefore, it was also written in the beginning without points. When it is thus read without points, then only the sense is attended to, and hence vowel sounds were formed, as also everyone who is skilled in that language can know. If anyone reads it in the Word, without points, he can never know, unless he follows the sense, what sense is therein, especially in the prophets; the vowels and like adjuncts thrust the sense upon the letter. Further, if they should read many of the same prophetic books without points, they would hence form many [different] senses; and had they attached the vowels, each person according to his own sense, then the letters would have been different by marked by every one, and when the vowels could not have been so marked according to the sense, they would have searched for anomalies in the words, so that still they would have formed the word to suit) their sense; for such is the language that there are many anomalies. Wherefore, it seems to be allowed, lest readers should torture the sense, that each [form the sense] according to his fancy, in that state of human mind which prevails while they are in the body; so that they should pervert the sense variously, everyone according to his genius. Wherefore, it was granted that points might afterwards be attached, which whether they are divinely inspired, may be known to some extent from the prophetic writings, where the sense is understood by no one save the Lord, and those to whom it pleases the Lord to reveal it. - 1748, June 27. </p>

De Lingua Hebraica<p>Didici ab angelis, quod Lingua Hebraica talis sit, ut modo sensus literae attendendus, non litera, quod confirmatum ex pluribus, quare etiam absque punctis initio est scripta; cum sic legebatur absque punctis, tunc sensus solum attendebatur, et inde formabantur accentus vocalium, sicut unicuique quoque, qui callet linguam istam sciri potest: si quis legit eam in Verbo absque punctis, nisi sequatur sensum, nusquam scire potest, quis sensus inest iis, cumprimis in prophetis; vocales et similia adjuncta, sensum ad literam detrudunt; tum si plures eosdem libros propheticos legerent absque punctis, inde plures sensus formarent, sique ii apposuissent vocales, quisque secundum suum sensum, tunc aliter signatae <sup>1</sup></p><p>fuissent literae ab unoquovis, et ubi non ita secundum sensum signari potuissent, in vocibus quaesivissent anomalias, ut usque vocem ad sensum suum formassent, nam talis est lingua, ut perplures anomaliae sint, quare concessum esse videtur, ne lectores torquerent sensum, quisque secundum suam phantasiam, in statu mentium humanarum <sup>2</sup></p><p>in quo sunt, nempe dum in corpore <sup>3</sup></p><p>, ne <sup>4</sup></p><p>sic perverterent sensum varie, quisque secundum suum genium, ut puncta postea adposita sint, quae num divinitus inspirata, ex propheticis scriptis sciri aliquatenus potest, ubi sensus a nullo, quam a Domino, intelligitur, et quibus Dominus beneplacet revelare. 1748, 27 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has signitae<p>2.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>3.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript<p>4.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quod </p>
