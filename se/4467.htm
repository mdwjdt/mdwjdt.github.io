<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4467</h4><p>4467. About a certain criminal one, Bishop Barek<p>He is among the refined wicked and infernal ones, who stood in a black garment, first toward the front, down below, later toward the left, and there ruled over others incognito, arousing them to criminality, this being his delight. He had a certain one who had been his friend in the life of his body, called Adelheim, who was his companion, and together with whom he was continually attempting criminal acts. In fact there was one also said to be the son of the latter, who was even more criminal. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4467</h4><p>4467. CONCERNING A CERTAIN WICKED SPIRIT, BISK. BAREK.<p>This one was among the wicked and the subtle infernals and stood in black clothing, at first in front beneath, and afterwards to the left, and there governed others incognito, inciting them to iniquities; such being his delight. He had a certain one in the life of the body, called Alderheim, for his friend, who was his partner, and together with him was continually attempting abominable things. A certain spirit said to have been the son of the latter is yet more wicked. </p>
