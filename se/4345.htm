<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4345</h4><p>4345. About memory<p>I asked a certain Jew, who supposed that he had a memory - for they speak among themselves as they had done on earth, and do not know that they are doing so out of an inner memory - I asked him what his name had been, and where he had come from. Having thought about it, he said he did not know, and was displeased. But it was granted me to tell him that for many reasons, this is preferable than for him to recall those facts, but as for his quality, whether he is good, or evil, this is found out in the other life, so that his quality is known. 1749, 8 Aug. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Mars, meaning Tuesday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4345</h4><p>4345. CONCERNING MEMORY.<p>I inquired of a certain Jew who supposed himself possessed of memory - for spirits converse with each other as on earth, without being aware that it is from the interior memory - I inquired, I say [of this Jew], his name, and whence he was. He thought and said he did not know, whereupon he became indignant. But it was given to say to him that this ignorance was for many reasons to be preferred. But as to one's quality whether he be good or evil, this is known in the other life, and hence he himself is known. - 1749, August 8. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4345 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4345. De memoria<p>Quaesivi quendam Judaeum, qui putabat se memoriam habere, nam inter se loquuntur sicut in tellure, et nesciunt quod ex memoria interiore, quaesivi quid nomen ejus fuit, et unde fuit, cogitavit et dixit se nescire, et indignatus; sed dicere ei datum quod hoc praestet rescire, ex causis pluribus, sed qualis est, sive bonus si vel malus, hoc scitur in altera vita, inde noscitur. 1749, 8 Aug. </p>
