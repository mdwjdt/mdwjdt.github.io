<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1076</h4><p>1076. On government of the whole and of the least parts<p>I just spoke with spirits about the Lord's universal government, saying that a universal cannot possibly exist unless it is in the very least parts, and that the universal consists of the very least parts, just as a general of particulars. Without the very least parts, therefore, the universal cannot possibly exist, for thus the universal entity would be nothing.<p>This was demonstrated in a spiritual way by a general view of the soul's government in every least point of the body. If its government were not in every least part, to put each least part to its own duties and to its own work, then all things could not possibly be under its universal auspices.<p>Even though this seemed so clear from demonstration by a spiritual view that it could not possibly be denied, yet when many spirits began to entertain doubts arising from a memory of their own particular ideas, a general darkness at once came over them. It was just like what would happen if the things just told and demonstrated were said to some present-day scholar. His doubts, gathered from many considerations, such as the souls of brute animals and such, as well as his own notions about the soul and the body, would bring on a similar, and even thicker cloud.<p>And if some doubts arose spontaneously, then the mind would be turned away from a universal, clear idea and directed toward a particular doubt, putting all and the least thoughts in confusion, and would end up in denial; and so it would go with the rest of the doubts also.<p>These words were said and written in the presence of a multitude of souls and spirits, and they could not bring up a single objection, because they see that the matter is as stated. For they are being withheld from raising their private doubts. 1748, 28 February. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1076</h4><p>1076. CONCERNING UNIVERSAL AND SINGULAR GOVERNMENT <p>I have now spoken with spirits concerning the Lord's universal government, saying that a universal cannot be given unless it is in the most single things, and that from the most single things the universal exists, as the general exists from the particulars; and that without the most single things there could be no universal, for thus a universal sense would be nothing. This was demonstrated in a spiritual manner by a general consideration of the government of the soul in each single point of the body. Unless there were this government of the soul in the single things, so as to dispose each thing to its own function and work, the whole could never be under its universal auspices. Although this was so clearly seen by demonstration from spiritual intuition that it can never be denied, nevertheless, when very many spirits began to raise doubts from the memory of particulars a general obscurity at once arose. The same would happen if the things just said and demonstrated were to be told to any learned man of the present day, for his doubts, accumulated from very many things, such as those concerning the souls of beasts and like questions, and also his notions concerning the soul and body, induce a similar and even denser cloud. And if any doubts should arise of themselves, the mind, from being in a clear universal idea, would be determined to some particular doubt, and thereby each and all things would be confused and would end in negation. So also would it be with everything else. These things were said and written in the presence of very many souls and spirits, and they cannot bring forth anything against it because they see that the matter is as stated, for they are withheld from setting forth particular doubts. 1748, Feb. 28. </p>

De regimine universali et singulari<p>Cum spiritibus nunc loquutus sum de regimine Domini universali, quod universale nusquam dabile sit, nisi sit in singularissimis, quodque a singularissimis existat universale, sicut a particularibus commune, et sicut absque singularissimis non dari possit universale, sic enim foret ens universale nihil, quod demonstratum est modo spirituali, per intuitionem generalem, ex animae regimine in corporis singula puncta, cujus nisi foret regimen in singulis, ut disponat singula ad sua officia, et ad suas operas, nusquam omnia possint esse sub auspicio ejus universali; hoc tametsi ita clarum visum est ex demonstratione intuitione spirituali, ut nusquam posset negari, usque spiritus perplures, cum inciperent dubia volvere, ex particularium memoria, illico obvenit obscuritas communis, prorsus sicut, dum illa quae modo dicta et demonstrata sunt, alicui hodierni temporis erudito dicerentur, nam dubia ejus congesta ex perplurimis, sicut ab anima brutorum, aque similibus, tum a suis notionibus de anima et corpore, similem nubem, et adhuc densiorem objicerent <sup>1</sup></p><p>; sique dubia moverentur per se aliqua, tunc mens ab universali clara idea, determinaretur in dubium particulare-sic <sup>2</sup></p><p>confunderentur omnia et singula-et <sup>3</sup></p><p>terminaretur in negationem, sic quoque de reliquis; haec dicta et scripta sunt in perplurium animarum et spirituum praesentia, nec quicquam possunt inferre, quia vident quod res se ita habeat, nam detinentur a particularium dubiorum expositione. 1748, 28 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has objicert<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has particulare, sic<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has singula, et </p>
