<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4836</h4><p>4836. About a certain one who united with the doctrine of charity for the sake of gaining favor (Rudberg <sup>1</sup>)<p>(It was Rudberg.) He was once called on to tell about the things I had written. He consequently believed himself to be on a higher level and more learned than others and became fired with a love of himself. And because he was acquainted with me, he assented to everything and approved with pleasure, although in himself he acknowledged and was well versed in quite another doctrine, the doctrine of faith alone. He then affixed himself to my back side and always had adultery in mind. From this it is evident that adulteries spring from such things.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Anders Rudberg (1678ֱ744), became Dean of Skara in 1736 and died in that post. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4836</h4><p>4836. CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO, FOR THE SAKE OF APPROBATION, ASSENTED TO THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY. RUDBERG.<p>(It was Rudberg.) He was once called upon to promulgate those things which were written by me; hence he believed himself exalted and learned above others, and came into the fire of self-love; and as he was acquainted with me, he therefore assented to, and approved all things with pleasure, although, within himself, he had acknowledged, and had been well versed in, a totally different doctrine - which was the doctrine of faith alone. He then applied himself to the back, and constantly committed adultery in intent. Hence it is manifest that from such persons proceed adulterations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4836 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4836. De quodam qui propter favorem unum fecit cum doctrina charitatis (Rudberg)<p>(Erat Rudberg), is semel accitus ad promendum illa quae scribebantur a me, inde se credebat evectum et doctum prae aliis, et in ignem amoris sui venit, et quia etiam notus fuit mihi, ideo assensit ad omnia, et approbavit cum voluptate, tametsi in se prorsus aliam doctrinam agnoverat, et bene calluerat, quae erat solius fidei; ille applicuit se ad tergum dein, et semper animo gerebat adulterium; inde patet quod a talibus adulterationes. </p>
