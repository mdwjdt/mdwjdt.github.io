<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5064</h4><p>5064. It was seen that when those from the Christian Mohammedans spoken of above were attacked by other [Mohammedans] and evil [spirits], their city sank down, without a sound, straight down, almost to a level with the land round about. In this way they were taken out of the way of attack because they were not seen. Round about them was as it were a mountain wall from which they were able to ascend and descend at liberty. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5064</h4><p>5064. It was seen, that, when those who were from the Christian Mohammedans <sup>1</sup>- of whom above - were infested by others, who were evil, their city sank down, but only with a silent and direct descent, almost to a level with the land round about: thus they were exempted from infestation, because they were not seen. There was round about them, as it were, a mountain wall. Hence they were able to ascend and descend, at pleasure.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;i.e. The Janissaries; see <a href="../se/5062.htm">5062</a>, above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5064 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5064. Visum quod qui e Mahumedanis Christianis, de quibus supra, cum infestabantur ab aliis, et malis, quod urbs eorum subsiderit, sed modo descensu tacito et recto, ad planitiem cum terra circumcirca fere, sic exemti sunt ab infestatione, quia non visi, circumcirca erat sicut murus montanus, inde potuerunt ascendere et descendere ad libitum. </p>
