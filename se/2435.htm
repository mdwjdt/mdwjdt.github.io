<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2435</h4><p>2435. About the prayers of little children<p>From experience I have been enabled to learn that the prayers of little children are much more fully heard in heaven than the prayers of grown-ups, and still more fully than those of people who have closed the way toward deeper things by thoughts of earthly matters and matters of memory - and even more fully than those of people who have become blind and thus have no belief, for in them the way toward heaven is closed.<p>An experience that enabled me to learn this is that sometimes when I was paying less attention to the words of the Lord's prayer, the angels, I was told, understood them more fully, as they also did when I was reading in the Word of the Lord, because the way was opened. Although this seemed strange to me, I nevertheless learned from experience that it was true, and also from the fact that spirits who are far away from me hear and understand better when I would be thinking silently. For my thinking, which is filled with diverse mental images, hindered the subject from being carried over well. 1748, 28 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2435</h4><p>2435. CONCERNING THE PRAYERS OF INFANTS. <p>It is given me to learn from experience that the prayers of infants have a much fuller hearing in heaven than the prayers of adults, and still fuller than [the prayers] of those who have closed the way towards interiors, by thoughts of natural things, and the things of memory, and still fuller than [the prayers] of those who are blinded and so have no faith; for with them, the way towards heaven is closed. [My] experience from which it was given to learn, that is [this] that when sometimes I attended less to what is in the Lord's prayer, then the angels, as was told me, perceived it more fully, as was also the case when I read in the Word of the Lord, because the way was open. This seemed wonderful to me, yet from experience it was granted to learn that it is true. In like manner from this, that those spirits who are, far away from me, hear and perceive better when I thought tacitly: for my thought, which was replete with different ideas, hinders the matter from being so well conveyed. - 1748, June 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2435 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2435. De precibus Infantum<p>Ab experientia discere <sup>1</sup></p><p>mihi datum est, quod preces infantum plenius multo audiantur in coelo, quam preces adultorum, et adhuc plenius quam eorum, qui clauserunt viam versus interiora per cogitationes rerum naturalium, ac rerum memoriae, et adhuc plenius eorum, qui occoecati sunt, sic nullam habentes fidem; nam apud eos clausa est via versus coelum. Experientia est, ex qua illud discere datum, quod quandoque cum minus intenderem iis quae in oratione Domini sunt, quod tunc angeli, sicut mihi dictum est, plenius perciperent, sicut etiam cum legerim in Verbo Domini; quia via aperta est; sed hoc mihi visum est mirabile, usque tamen ab experientia verum esse discere datum est; similiter ex eo, quod qui longinqui a me sunt spiritus, melius audiant et percipiant, cum tacite cogitarem; nam cogitatio mea, quae ideis diversis repleta est, impediit, quin auferretur res ita bene. 1748, 28 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;imperfectum in the Manuscript </p>
