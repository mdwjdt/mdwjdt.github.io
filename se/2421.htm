<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2421</h4><p>2421. About a certain remarkable insanity<p>It happened to me at times, when spirits were permitted to act out their insanities, that they were permitted to do so through me, as if they were doing it, not knowing otherwise. It happened in this way quite often, but in every case I was given to know that it was the action of spirits, not my own, for I was enabled to feel it and to tell them that it was they, not I, which they fully acknowledged to be so.<p>So I was being told a remarkable fact, namely that a person who has belief can sometimes appear to fellow human beings as abnormal. Or, as they expressed it, that one can become insane as to the body and yet not as to the mind or thinking, but that conversely, people who are body-bound become insane as to the mind or thought, or inwardly, yet can appear outwardly or as to the body just like angels, kind and wise. So the converse is the case, because order is inverted. 1748, 27 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2421</h4><p>2421. A CERTAIN MEMORABLE [RELATION] CONCERNING INSANITY. <p>It had happened to me several times, when spirits were permitted to act according to their insanities, which was permitted so that they might act through me, that it was they as it were who acted, and they did not know otherwise. This [occurred] frequently; but it was granted me as often to know that it proceeded from spirits, and not from me, which they acknowledged to be wholly so. Hence this memorable fact was told me, that a man who is in faith may sometimes appear to men not like another, or, as they said. But that men who are corporeal are insane in mind or thought, that he can be insane in the body, but not in mind or thought, or internally, but externally or in the body can appear like angels, modest and wise, so that there is an inversion, because order is inverted. - 1748, June 27. </p>

De insania quoddam memorabile<p>Mihi contigerat aliquoties, quod cum permissum esset spiritibus, ut agerent secundum suas insanias, quod permissum ut agerent per me, sicut ii agerent, nec aliter sciebant, ita saepius, sed datum mihi toties erat, scire quod spirituum esset, non meum, nam percipere id dabatur, et <sup>1</sup></p><p>iis dicere, quod ii essent, non ego, quod agnoscebant prorsus ita esse; inde memorabile, quod mihi dicebatur, quod homo qui in fide, possit apparere hominibus quandoque non sicut alius {a}, vel ut dicebant, quod corpore possit insanire, non autem mente aut cogitatione; at vero quod homines qui cooporei sunt, insaniant mente seu cogitatione, seu interius, extrinsecus autem aut corpore possint apparere sicut angeli, modesti et sapientes, ita ut inversum sit, quia inversus ordo. 1748, 27 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has dabatur; et </p>
