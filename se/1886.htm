<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1886</h4><p>1886. About the field of hearing<p>Certain angels and spirits who were within, showed me experientially what a field of hearing is like. For when I had spoken with spirits previously, both those within and those on the outside heard. It was open to all who are near me. But at that time I felt a kind of pulling, especially toward the outside, which, I was told, was caused by spirits above me and around me, so that they would be aware of everything I was thinking and saying. So there was open communication, and a pulling sensation, sometimes even accompanied with pain.<p>Now, however, the pulling was coming from angels and spirits within me, thus from the inside and not from the outside. Consequently, there was no such letting go as before - which I was enabled to feel distinctly - and thus no hearing or awareness on the part of the spirits above and outside of me, of what I was saying and what I was thinking. They complained on this account, admitting that now for the first time they saw and heard nothing, only knowing that I had spoken with those who were within.<p>From this experience one can infer the nature of a field of hearing, as well as the fact that those outside of the greatest human being cannot be aware of things that those who are within it can. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1886</h4><p>1886. CONCERNING THE SPHERE OF HEARING. <p>Certain angels and spirits who were within showed me experimentally the quality of the sphere of hearing: for when I spoke with spirits on a former occasion, I was heard both by those who were within and those who were without; it was evident to all who were around me; but I then perceived a certain one to be attracted in a more especial manner outwardly, which I was informed was done by a spirit above and around me, in order that such might perceive everything which I thought and spoke. Thus there was an open communication and a sensible attraction, and indeed at times with a sensation of pain; but on this occasion there was an attraction effected by angels and spirits towards me, thus inwardly but not outwardly, there be in no such relaxation as there was before, which it was given me distinctly to perceive, whence there was no hearing or perception as to what I said or what I thought on the part of the spirits above or without me. On this account they complained and confessed that now for the first time they perceived and heard nothing; they only knew that I spoke with those who were within. Hence it may be concluded how the case is with the sphere of hearing, as also that those who are without the Grand Man cannot perceive the things which are perceived by those who are within. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1886 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1886. De sphaera auditionis<p>Quidam angeli et spiritus, qui erant intus, per experientiam mihi ostendebant, qualis sit sphaera auditionis; nam dum prius loquutus sum cum spiritibus, audiverunt tam ii, qui intus fuerunt, quam qui extus, apertum erat omnibus, qui circa me sunt; sed tunc sentiebam quendam attractum, cumprimis extrorsum, quod mihi dictum fieri a spiritibus <sup>1</sup></p><p>supra me, et circum me, ut percipiant omnia, quae cogitarem, et quae loquerer, erat sic communicatio aperta, et sentita attractio, et quidem cum sensu quandoque doloris; nunc autem ab angelis et spiritibus in me attractio fiebat, sic introrsum, non autem extrorsum, quo nulla talis relaxatio ut prius, quod mihi sentire manifeste dabatur, inde nulla auditio aut perceptio, quid loquerer et quid cogitarem, spiritibus supra seu extra me; inde conquesti sunt, et fassi, quod nunc primum nihil perciperent et audirent, scirent modo quod loquutus sim cum iis qui intus: inde concludi potest, quomodo se sphaera auditionis habeat, tum quoque quod ii qui extra hominem maximum sunt, non possint percipere ea, quae percipiunt ii, qui intra sunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has spiritus </p>
