<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2905</h4><p>2905. About truldom <sup>1</sup><p>There was a certain one who said that in the life of the body he had indeed harmed others through witchcraft or truldom, to the point of inflicting on them evil, pains, and the like, and who was practicing the same in the other life. He was told that the punishment of such people is one of retaliation. So hellish spirits drew him down to themselves and tormented him with the same practices. This was made known to me by his outcry and lamentations, saying with a bitter tone that he had sinned. 1748, 24 Aug.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "witchcraft." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2905</h4><p>2905. CONCERNING TRULLDOM. <p>A certain one, who said that he had also injured others by arts of sorcery or trulldom, during the life of the body, so that he inflicted on others, evil, pains and the like, and in the other life practices the like, was told that the punishment of such things is one of retaliation: wherefore evil spirits have dragged him away to themselves, and tormented him with similar [pains], which was given me to know by his outcry and lamentation; he said with a bitter voice that he has sinned. - 1748, August 24. </p>
