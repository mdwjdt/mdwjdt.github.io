<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1339</h4><p>1339. For anything to be perfect, it must also put on a kind of body<p>I have spoken with souls about the fruits of faith, acts of charity, stressing that works of charity are a kind of body, whose soul is faith; and that nothing in the universe is perfect unless it also relates to something like a body. I also said that there is nothing in human life that does not resemble the human being, nor in the whole of heaven, where the heaven of spirits, as well as each spirit individually, represents a body. So it is in other cases. 1748, 14 March.<p>I added that the body regarded in itself is nothing in respect to the soul but something obedient and servile, and consequently, the obedient and servile body contains the prior elements, as if it were the soul. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1339</h4><p>1339. IN ORDER THAT ANYTHING MAY BE PERFECT IT MUST ALSO PUT ON A KIND OF BODY <p>I conversed with souls concerning the fruits of faith or the works of charity to the effect that the works of charity have reference to a kind of body whose soul is faith, and that nothing is perfect in the universe unless there is also relatively a kind of body. Further, that there is nothing in the life of man that is not like a man. It is similar in the entire heaven where the heaven of spirits, and likewise every spirit, has reference to the body. And so in other cases. 1748, Mar. 14. Further, that the body regarded in itself relatively to the soul is nothing except something obedient and subservient; and that the body thus obedient and subservient contains the prior things and is, as it were, a soul. </p>

Ut sit aliquid perfectum, etiam corporis speciem induet<p>Cum animabus de fructibus fidei, seu operibus charitatis loquutus, et quidem quod opera charitatis referant speciem corporis, cujus anima est fides; et quod nihil in universo perfectum sit, nisi sit quoque species corporis respective, et quod nihil in hominis vita sit, quod non homini simile sit, in universo coelo similiter, ibi spirituum coelum refert corpus, similiter omnis spiritus; et sic in caeteris, 1748, 14 Martius; tum <sup>1</sup></p><p>quod corpus in se spectatum nihil sit respective ad animam, nisi obediens quid et servum, et quod corpus sic obediens et servum, contineat priora, et sit quasi anima.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has Martius. tum </p>
