CONCERNING NEREZ AND EXECRABLE REVENGE, AND CONCERNING THOSE AT THE BACK.<p>He was in a certain city, which was upon a rock and he was accepted there by the others as governor; but he did everything for the sake of gain, and, in the whole and in every particular, had regard to profit; and, in various ways, he compelled those who were rich to give him money. </p>

De Nerez, et nefanda vindicta, et de illis a tergo<p>Ille fuit in urbe quadam super petra, et receptus ibi inter alios ut gubernator, sed agebat omnia propter lucrum, et in omnibus et singulis spectabat lucrum, et qui divites erant adigebat vario modo ad dandum sibi pecunias. </p>
