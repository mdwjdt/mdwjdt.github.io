<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4269</h4><p>4269. About mediums<p>I observed that they send spirits from their own into other societies, so that they can have communication with them. Sometimes evil spirits go forth into many of them like a spider, as mentioned earlier [<a href="2376.htm">2376</a>]. They are those who enter by permission into societies and arouse those in it, and their quality of life is examined, and they are then dissociated according to each one's nature and character. It was said that a certain woman was in that society about whom they complained a great deal, and another society claimed she was from theirs. 1749, 13 May. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Astrological symbol of Jupiter, meaning Thursday. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4269</h4><p>4269. CONCERNING SUBJECTS.<p>It was observed that spirits send emissaries from their own to other societies, in order to hold communication with them. Sometimes evil spirits go forth like spiders, into many foreign societies, as was said before; they are those who enter from permission into societies and excite them, and thence the members are explored as to their quality during their whole lives, and thus they are dissociated according to the nature and genius of each one. It was discovered that there were some such in a particular society, at which there was much complaint, and another society said that they were from their own members. - 1749, May 13. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4269 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4269. De subjectis<p>Observatum, quod spiritus a suis in alias societates mittant, ut cum iis communicationem habere possint, mali quandoque in plures, sicut aranea, ut prius dictum [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4269/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2376" target=_top>2376</a>], sunt ii, qui ex permissione, intrant in societates excitant eos inde explorantur quales sunt quoad talem vitam sic dissociantur secundum cujusvis naturam indolem: detectum, quod quaedam in societate, de qua multum conquesti altera societas dicebat quod ex suis. 1749, 13 Maj. </p>
