<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2334</h4><p>2334. Another wonder is that spirits, depending on their quality, appear at a certain quarter, overhead, directly, in front, in back, to the side, or in a line horizontal to the face, or at every quarter with respect to a given bodily organ, either lower near the neck, chest, stomach, side, loins, feet, or lower, and even deep down - and there is never any mistake. So the quarter is near, or a bit farther away, rather high or rather deep down, as was told earlier about the swamp, Gehenna [<a href="935.htm">935</a>, <a href="1379.htm">1379-1386</a>], that it appears constantly in the same quarter. No matter which way one turns oneself, the spirits remain fixed as long as they are of that character. This depends on their quality, thus on their location in the Grand Body, according to the Lord's arrangement. This was demonstrated to spirits by an experiment, namely, that wherever I turned myself, they still appeared so situated with respect to my body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2334</h4><p>2334. (The other fact is, that spirits, according to their quality, appear in a certain region, either directly above the head, to the front, rear, side, or in a horizontal line with the face, or in every region of any organ thereof, or below about the neck, breast, stomach, side, loins, feet, or beneath, and indeed very deep, and this never fails. Thus they appear near, or slightly removed) (high or low, just as was previously said concerning the lake Gehenna, that it continually appears in the same quarter; and this, wherever man turns himself; still are they there fixed so long as they are of such a sort. These things are circumstanced according to their quality, hence according to their situation in the Grand Man, according to the ordination of the Lord. This was demonstrated to me by experience, to wit, that wherever I could have turned myself they still appeared thus situated with respect to the body.) </p>

Alterum est, quod spiritus secundum qualitatem suam appareant ad certam plagam, sive supra caput, directe, antrorsum, retrorsum, ad latus, vel in linea horizontali cum facie, aut alicujus ejus organi ad omnem plagam, vel infra circa collum, pectus, ventrem, latus, lumbos, pedes, vel infra, et quidem profunde, et hoc nusquam fallit; ita prope vel paulo remotius, altius vel profundius, sicut de stagno, Gehenna, dictum prius [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2334/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_935" target=_top>935</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_2334/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1379" target=_top>1379-1386</a>], quod jugiter appareat in eadem plaga, et hoc quocunque se homo vertat, usque ibi sicut fixi <sup>1</sup></p><p>sunt, dum tales; se habet <sup>2</sup></p><p>hoc secundum qualitatem eorum, inde secundum situm in Corpore Maximo, secundum ordinationem Domini; quod experientia spiritibus demonstratum, nempe quod ubicunque me verterim, usque apparuerunt ita respective ad corpus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript fixae in fixi emendatum<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has habent </p>
