<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4514</h4><p>4514. The most profane female medium, who was very severely punished so many times, and just as often became worse even finally to the point where she escaped all the punishments and cared nothing about them - was carried down into different hells, about which she finally could not care less, but there always thought up new schemes so that she would rule them, and attach them to herself. In this way she attached many of them to herself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4514</h4><p>4514. That most profane subject [before spoken of] was repeatedly punished with the utmost severity, and was as often made worse; till at length she would elude all punishments, and care nothing for them. She was conveyed into different hells, which she finally came to regard scarcely at all, but was there continually intent upon new machinations prompted by the desire to rule over them, and to adjoin them to herself which indeed she did in regard to several. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4514 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4514. Prophanissimum subjectum toties punita gravissime, et toties pejor facta, usque demum ut eluderet omnes poenas, et nihil curaret, delata in diversa inferna, quae tandem vix curabat, sed ibi semper novas machinationes excogitavit, sic ut iis vellet imperare, et sibi adjungere. Ita adjunxit sibi plura. </p>
