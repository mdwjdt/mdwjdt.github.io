<p>197.不敬虔的邪恶灵人按次序排列。我想前面（161节）说过，灵人按照属和种被分门别类。无论在哪个具体社群，灵人都是被如此排列的：最坏的在中间，是那些虽接受过教导，却远离并模糊真理之光的人；往外走，那些更接近边界的人渐渐好一点；那些尽管与其他人相似，但没有接受过教导的人在边界。弥赛亚神如此排列是为了让最坏的受到约束和压制，因为他们若不联合起来，就既不能行动，也不能说话。根据弥赛亚神的审判，外层灵人被允许（作为许多人或一人）说话或行动；所以才会有许多人的集体言语，这在试探期间不是那么有害。此外，内层灵人也被允许说话和行动，如在内在试探期间。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 197</h4><p>197. About the setting in order of evil and ungodly spirits<p>That spirits are arranged by kinds and species into classes has, I believe, been said before [<a href="161.htm">161</a>], and, in regard to any given society in particular, so arranged that in their midst are the worst, such as those who had knowingly departed from and obscured the light of truth. Going outward, those closer to the circumference are better by degrees, and at the periphery are those who, though similar to the rest, had not known better.<p>This arrangement is made by God the Messiah, so that the worst ones are surrounded and restrained, for they are unable to act or to speak except as a group. According to the judgment of God the Messiah, the spirits toward the outside are allowed to speak or to do - many as one, so it is the collective speech of many - things that are not too harmful, in times of temptation; and the spirits toward the inside, too, as in times of inward temptations. 1747, the 4th day of September (old calendar). </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 197</h4><p>197. CONCERNING THE ARRANGEMENT IN ORDER OF EVIL AND WICKED SPIRITS <p>That spirits are distributed into classes according to genera and species was, I think, said before [n. <a href="../se/161.htm">161</a>. With regard to any society in particular, the spirits are so distributed that in the middle are the worst, being those who, having been instructed, fell away and darkened the light of truth; those who recede thence towards the boundary are by degrees better; those in the boundary are singular, but they have not been previously instructed. This distribution is effected by God Messiah, so that the worst ones may be restrained and repressed, for they can neither act nor speak except in consociation. Those who are exterior are permitted to speak or act, as many or as one, according to the judgment of God Messiah; thus there is the collective speech of many, and this is not so harmful in temptations. Also, those who are interior are permitted to speak and act, as in the case of interior temptations. 1747, Sept. 4, o.s. </p>

De ordinatione malorum et impiorum spirituum<p>Quod spiritus secundum genera et species in classes distributi sunt, prius, ut arbitror dictum est [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_197/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_161" target=_top>161</a>]; quod societatem quandam in specie attinet, ita distributi, ut in medio eorum sint pessimi, ut qui instructi desciverunt, ac occoecarunt lucem veritatis; qui inde procedunt versus ambitum, sunt per gradus meliores, in ambitu similes, sed qui prius non instructi; quae distributio fit a Deo Messia, ut coerceantur compescantur pessimi, nam nec agere nec loqui possunt nisi in consociatione; secundum arbitrium Dei Messiae, permittuntur exteriores loqui aut agere plures <sup>1</sup></p><p>ut <sup>2</sup></p><p>unus, sic est collecta loquela plurium non <sup>3</sup></p><p>ita noxia in tentationibus; tum etiam interiores, ut in tentationibus interioribus. 1747, d. 4 Sept. st. v.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has agere, plures<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has aut<p>3.&nbsp;The Manuscript has plurium, non </p>
