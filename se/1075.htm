<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1075</h4><p>1075. From the cortical and striate substances of the internal organs,<p>conclusions can be drawn regarding the differences between spiritual qualities and heavenly ones in spirits <sup>1</sup><p>The universal distinction among spirits is between those who are spiritual and those who are heavenly. Then there are intermediate differences.<p>Every part or internal organ of the body is like this. In each and every one there are its own proper tissues, which come forth from the blood vessels in different ways. So, for example, in the eye: the vitreous humor is (I assume) cortical substance, but not striated. In the crystalline lens there are striae, but rather hard ones.<p>There are striae in other internal organs likewise [see <a href="1058.htm">1058</a>]. In the intestines are similar striae in their tunics, where there are labyrinthine, winding vessels; and elsewhere besides. The very capillaries, as they are called, <sup>2</sup>also derive their nature from those beginnings, so they reflect the beginning in their every point.<p>This is true also of the spiritual quality, or reasoning power: if the beginning is not thus continued in them so that they are extensions of the beginnings, <sup>3</sup>then the spiritual quality is of no importance or use; it becomes numb, and disjoined, not to mention many other consequences. 1748, 28 February.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the index at Cerebrum and Fibra, this paragraph is summarized as follows: "The origins of the tissues in the brains and individual internal organs relate to heavenly qualities, and the tissues themselves to spiritual qualities."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The Latin is capilli, "hairs."<br><br>3.&nbsp;I. e., the cortical substances; see 1059. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1075</h4><p>1075. FROM THE CORTICAL AND STRIATED SUBSTANCES OF THE VISCERA CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN CONCERNING THE DIFFERENCE OF SPIRITS AS TO SPIRITUAL AND CELESTIAL THINGS <p>The universal distinction of spirits is between those who are spiritual and those who are celestial; hence there are intermediate differences. Every member and viscus of the body is such, for in each and all of them there are fibers proper to each which arise from the blood vessels in different ways. Thus in the case of the eye the vitreous humor there is cortical substance, (as I suppose), but not striated; in the crystalline lens the substances are striated, but are of a harder quality. In the other viscera it is the same. There are similar substances in the coats of the intestines where there are labyrinthine windings of the vessels, besides other places. The capillaries themselves, as they are called, also derive their nature from those beginnings, so that they refer to their beginning at every point. It is similar as regards the spiritual or rational. In those things in which the beginning is not continued in this way, so that there are continued beginnings, the spiritual is of no account and of no use; it becomes torpid and is disjoined; besides very many other things. <sup>1</sup>1748, Feb. 28. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The entry in the Index (s.v. Fibra) has: "The origins of the fibers in the brains and in the single viscera relate to celestial things, and the fibers thence derived to spiritual things." </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1075 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1075. De spirituum differentia quoad spiritualia et coelestia concludi potest ex substantiis corticalibus et striatis viscerum<p>Distinctio spirituum universalis est inter spirituales et coelestes, inde differentiae mediae; unumquodvis membrum, aut viscus corporis tale est, nam in iis omnibus et singulis sunt fibrae propriae, quae scaturiunt a vasis sanguineis, diverso modo, sic quoque in oculo, ibi est humor vitreus (ut <sup>1</sup></p><p>autumo) substantia corticalis, non autem striata; in lente chrystallina sunt striae, sed tales ut duriores sint; in aliis visceribus sunt similiter: in intestinis sunt similes in eorum tunicis, ubi labyrintheae <sup>2</sup></p><p>circuitiones vasorum, praeter alibi; ipsi capilli, ut vocantur, etiam trahunt principiis istis suam naturam, sic ut principium referant in unoquovis puncto, similiter spirituale seu rationale, in quibus [cum] principium non continuatur ita, sic ut sint principia continuata, est spirituale nullius momenti, nullius usus, torpescit, et disjungitur, praeter plurima alia. 1748, 28 Febr.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has vitreus,<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I. Tafel's edition; the Manuscript has labyrinthei </p>
