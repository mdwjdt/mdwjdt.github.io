<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2662</h4><p>2662. About a turmoil under the sole of the left foot<p>Several times I have heard some commotion beneath the sole of the left foot, even to the point where there was a clear sensation as of trembling waves. And because I had felt this several times, I did not want to inquire what it was, supposing it to be the murmur of some crowd, [but] now I did ask what it was. Thereupon came the reply that they were those coming from the world who had been obsessed by the passion for fighting and killing people. They seem to themselves to behave in the same way in the other life, seeming to themselves to kill, to mangle one another, to cut off each other's hands and arms, and so to fight as they had liked doing in life. There they are treated miserably, actually feeling the pains, until they are no longer obsessed by such a passion. 1748, 21 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2662</h4><p>2662. CONCERNING A TUMULT UNDER THE SOLE OF THE LEFT FOOT. <p>I have several times heard, a certain commotion under the sole of the left foot, even so that it vibrated tremulously, with manifest sensation, and because this was several times perceived, I did not wish to inquire what it might be, supposing that it was the murmur of some multitude: I have now inquired what it might be: it was replied thence, that they were those who come from the world and have been obsessed by the cupidity of fighting and killing men. These seem to themselves to act similarly in the other life, and seem to themselves to kill and mangle each other, to cut of each other's hands and arms, and so to fight, as they have desired in life: they are there miserably treated, and indeed with a sense of pains, until they are no longer obsessed by such a desire. - 1748, July 21. </p>

De tumultu sub sinistri pedis planta<p>Aliquoties audivi quandam commotionem sub planta pedis sinistri, usque adeo ut quasi undularet tremule, cum manifesta sensatione, et quia hoc aliquoties perceptum, non volui inquirere quid esset, putans quod esset murmur cujusdam multitudinis; nunc quaesivi quid esset, respondebatur inde, quod essent ii qui e mundo veniunt, et cupiditate pugnandi occidendique homines obsessi fuerunt, ii similiter sibi videntur agere in altera vita, sibique videntur occidere unus <sup>1</sup></p><p>alterum, lacerare, amputare manus et brachia, et sic pugnare sicut in vita cupiverint, ibi miserabiliter tractantur, et quidem cum sensu dolorum, usque dum tali cupidine non amplius obsidentur. 1748, 21 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
