<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4138</h4><p>4138. About misfortunes<p>I realized that no misfortunes, or bad luck, as they are called, can happen to a person who is with the Lord. For evil spirits were present when some horse threatened harm. Suddenly they were cast down. Those who were with me declared that they are able to see from such occurrences what kind of spirits they are who bring misfortunes along with them. This was later confirmed. 1749, 14 Jan. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4138</h4><p>4138. CONCERNING MISFORTUNES.<p>I perceived that no disasters or fortuitous evils, as they are called, can happen to a man with whom the Lord is: for when by the agency of evil spirits who were present, a restive horse threatened injury [to his rider], those spirits were suddenly cast down. They that were with me observed, that from such things it might be perceived what kind of spirits they are who bring misfortunes with them, which was afterwards confirmed. - 1749, January 14. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4138 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4138. De infortuniis<p>Perceptum quod nulla infortunia seu fortuita ut vocantur, mala accidere possint homini, qui apud Dominum; mali enim spiritus aderant, cum aliqui equus minaretur malum, subito erant dejecti, dicebant qui apud me, quod ex talibus percipere possint, quales spiritus sunt, qui infortunia secum adducunt: quod postea confirmatum. 1749, 14 Jan. </p>
