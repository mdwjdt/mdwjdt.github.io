<p>355.关于灵人的形式。灵人只感觉他们具有人的形态，因而有一个身体、有皮、骨和血（然而，他们也被指示，他们不能保留那些没有用的东西）；他们认为自己有头发、站立的双脚等等，故由此也可推知，他们也有内脏，如胃、肠，膀胱等；然而，他们不需要这些。当听到这一切时，他们的确意识到自己不需要它们，但仍以为他们保留了它们的形态，即便不是内在形态，也是外在形态；事实上，他们从世上保留了对赤身露体的那种羞耻感，因此，以为自己穿着衣服，认为赤身露体是一件很可耻的事。这种形式究竟具有什么性质，确实不得而知；但从大脑最小的器官可在某种程度上得出结论，即：身体形式的起源在哪里；灵人是与这些最小器官并无二致的形式，但仍可以被恢复成一种与人的形式相似的形式，只要他们将其心智的思维集中在它上面。（1747年12月15日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 355</h4><p>355. About the form of spirits<p>Spirits do not sense otherwise that that they are equipped with a human figure, thus with a body, skin, bones, blood (when yet it was shown them that they cannot retain things which are of no use), that they have hair, feet to stand on, and more; from which it would also follow that they have the inner parts, such as a stomach, intestines, bladder, etc., for which, however, they have no need.<p>When they hear all this, they do realize that they have no need of them, and yet [they see] that they retain their figure, if not an inner one, still an outer one; and in fact, they retain the shame of nakedness from the world, so that they think they are dressed in clothes, considering it a disgrace to appear naked.<p>Although it is really not known what their actual form is, one can nevertheless deduce this much from the most minute organs of the brain, where the beginnings of the body's form lie: that spirits are forms not unlike those [minute organs], but can still be restored to a form similar to the human one, whenever they focus the thoughts of their mind upon it. 1747, the 15th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 355</h4><p>355. CONCERNING THE FORM OF SPIRITS <p>Spirits perceive no otherwise than that they are in the human figure, thus that they are in a body with skin, bones and blood, when nevertheless it was shown them that they cannot retain those things which are of no use; as they suppose that they have hair, that they have feet upon which they stand, and many other things, whence it would follow that they also have viscera, such as belly, intestines, bladder and the like, for which, nevertheless, they have no need. When they hear these things they indeed perceive that they have no need of them, but still [suppose] that they retain the figure - if not the internal, still the external; and indeed they retain from the world a shame of nakedness and therefore suppose that they are clothed with garments, for they suppose it disgraceful to appear naked. But of what quality is this form properly is indeed unknown; but it can be concluded in some measure from the least organs of the brain, where are the beginnings of the form of the body; that they are forms not dissimilar to them, but that they can still be restored into a form similar to the human, as often as they direct their mind to it by thoughts. 1747, Dec. 15. </p>
