<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2777</h4><p>2777. About those who consider worship to consist in externals only, and therefore live confidently<p>There were certain spirits who had been among the worst, because their inner aura, that of their intentions and motives, regarded nothing but the world and themselves. Their persuasive aura was discussed earlier [<a href="2764.htm">2764-2765</a>], namely that they had lived only for themselves and indulged their inclinations, despising all others compared with themselves, and whatever of goodness there was in others they either failed to understand or despised as something worthless. When their life was examined, it was found that during their bodily life they had lived in externals in regard to worship in a way that nothing could be faulted. They had attended church regularly, had gone to the holy supper at the appointed time, abstaining from outer, worldly </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2777</h4><p>2777. CONCERNING THOSE WHO PLACE WORSHIP IN EXTERNALS ONLY, AND SO LIVE IN SECURITY. <p>Certain spirits, who have been [were] amongst the worst, because their interior sphere, or [that] of intentions or ends, [only regarded] the world and self, concerning whose persuasive sphere it has been previously treated, to wit, that they only lived for self and indulged inclination [genio] despising all others in comparison with themselves, and whatever good was in [at] others, either did not apprehend, or despised as worthless. When their life was examined, it was found, that in the life of their body they have lived in externals, as regards worship, so as not to be blamed: to wit, that they have frequented the place of worship (temple), have gone, at stated times, to the holy supper; on the preceding evening and day, when they have gone to the supper, have abstained in externals, from worldly things, </p>
