<p>447.关于穆罕默德：他赶走了一群朝他走来的人，说他们应该去找神的儿子耶稣。在午后一个清醒的异象中，我看见穆罕默德向一群朝他走来的人发怒，强行、甚至愤怒地赶走他们，说他们应该去找神的儿子耶稣，而不是找他，因为他意识到，耶稣是神的独子，统治整个天堂，世界和大地的至高创造者已经将权柄赋予了祂。我以同样的方式听见他说话，现在感觉他听见这些话，并指导写下这些话，恳求我把这些话告诉崇拜他的人。（1748年1月6日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 447</h4><p>447. About Mohammed: that he drove off a crowd coming towards him, and said they should go to Jesus, the Son of God<p>In a waking afternoon vision, I saw Mohammed becoming angry at a crowd that was coming towards him, and rather forcefully driving them away, and even angrily. He was saying that they should go to Jesus, the Son of God, not to him, because he realized that Jesus was the only Son of God, ruling the whole heaven, to Whom the power has been given by the most high Creator of the World and earth.<p>This is just what I heard him saying and, I now perceive, hearing these words. And he is guiding [the writing of] them, entreating me to tell this to his worshippers. 1748, the 6th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 447</h4><p>447. CONCERNING MAHOMED: THAT HE DROVE AWAY THE CROWD THAT CAME TO HIM, AND SAID THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO JESUS, THE SON OF GOD <p>In the afternoon, in a wakeful vision, I saw Mahomed moved to anger against the crowd that came to him, driving them away with some force, and indeed with anger, and saying that they should go to Jesus, the Son of God, not to himself, for he perceived Him to be the one only Son of God, governing the whole Heaven, to whom power has been given by the Supreme Creator of the world and the earth. In like manner I have heard him speaking, and now I perceive that he hears these things and directs these words, praying that I should say this to his worshippers. <sup>1</sup>1748, Jan. 6. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Crossed out: "He does not want them to adore him any longer, unless they would be treated badly after the life of their body." </p>

De Mahumede, quod abegerit turbam ad se venientem, et dixerit, quod ad Jesum, Filium Dei, irent<p>Post meridiem in visione vigili vidi Mahumedem irascentem turbae ad se venienti, et abigentem vi quadam, et quidem cum ira, dicentemque quod ad Jesum, Filium Dei irent, non ad semet <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quia percipiebat Ipsum esse Filium Dei unicum, universum coelum regentem, Cui potestas data a summo creatore Mundi et terrae, simile audivi eum dicentem, ac nunc percipio, haec audientem, et verba haec dirigentem, precantemque ut dicerem id ejus adoratoribus. 1748, die 6 Jan.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic manuscript </p>
