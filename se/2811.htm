<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2811</h4><p>2811. About certain kinds of thefts that are exposed in the other life<p>There are clandestine thefts, meaning those of human minds, when they try in a thousand ways to captivate and steal into people's minds, and indeed, by a kind of theft, that is, by entirely putting on what is pleasant and dear to another so as to present themselves as the very personification [of those qualities]. When they have learned this kind of theft in bodily life by actual practice, of which there are [various] kinds and species, then the individual cases are evaluated according to their nature acquired by practice.<p>Some have almost no motive other than self - their own peace of mind, pleasure, and to be appreciated ahead of others, yet these motives are not hurtful. But others strive after the same ends - and do so more cleverly and at length from an acquired nature - for different motives, such as getting hold of the goods and dignities belonging to others by any means whatever. These are the worst.<p>There are intermediate kinds and species-there are both kinds and species of captivating the minds of others, and kinds and species of motives for striving to do this. Then there are kinds and species of methods by which they go about this, and the extent to which it is evident to the person's sight, or hidden from it. These things were shown to me by actual experience with two spirits known to me in life. 1748, 14 Aug.<p>There are also those who capture minds even to the point of impersonating, for the sake of adultery. These are adulterous thieves, and this also is one kind in the category of motives, this motive being adultery. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2811</h4><p>2811. CONCERNING GENERA OF CERTAIN [KINDS] THEFTS, WHICH ARE MANIFESTED IN THE OTHER LIFE. <p>There are secret thefts, yea of the minds [animorum] of man, so that they attempt in a thousand modes to gain and insinuate themselves into the minds of men, yea by a sort of theft, to wit: by wholly putting on that which is pleasant and dear to another so as to present themselves, as it were, in the same person, and when in the life of the body they have acquired to themselves, by actuality, such a kind [genus] of theft, of which there are genera and species, then everyone is determined according to his nature acquired by actuality - certain to scarcely any other end than self-repose, their own pleasantness, praise, and that they may snatch [these] from others, but these are not injurious: but others seek a similar [think] and act more ingeniously, and at length having acquired that nature for ends that are different, for instance, to snatch away the goods and honors of others in any manner whatever: such are the worst. There are given genera and intermediate species, as well genera and species of captivating the minds of others, as genera and species of ends, for which they are solicitous, also genera and species of the modes in which they strive therefore, and of the modes in which it is manifest in the eyes of man, or hidden from them. These [things] were shown me by living experience through two spirits known [to me] in life. - 1748, August 14. There are also such as captivate minds [animos]: still as they put on persons for sake of adultery, they are adulterous thieves. This also is one genus as respects ends, which are adulteries. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2811 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2811. De generibus furtorum quorundam <sup>1</sup></p><p>, quae in altera vita manifestantur<p>Sunt furta clandestina, et quidem animorum hominis, ut mille modis capere conentur et se insinuare in animos hominum <sup>2</sup></p><p>, et quidem furto quodam, nempe prorsus induendo id quod alteri jucundum et charum, sic ut sistat se in eadem quasi persona, et cum in vita corporis actualitate sibi comparaverint tale genus furti, cujus genera et species sunt, tunc determinatur [genus] apud quemvis secundum ejus acquisitam actualitate naturam: quidam [tale faciunt] modo fere ob nullum finem, quam propter se, sui quietem, jucunditatem, laudem, utque praeripiant aliis, sed hi non sunt nocivi, at alii simile affectant, et solertius faciunt, et tandem ex natura acquisita, ob fines, qui diversi sunt, sicut diripiendi aliorum bona et honores, quocunque modo, tales sunt pessimi; dantur genera et species intermediae, tam genera et species captandi animos aliorum, quam genera et species finium, propter quos affectant; tum genera et species modorum quomodo id student, et quomodo id manifestum est in oculis hominis, vel ab iis occultum. Haec mihi ad vivam <sup>3</sup></p><p>experientiam per binos spiritus in vita notos, ostensa sunt. 1748, 14 Aug. Etiam sunt qui capiunt animos, usque ut induant personas adulterii causa, sunt fures adulteri, hoc unum quoque genus, quoad fines, qui [finis] est adulterium.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has quorundam<p>2.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
