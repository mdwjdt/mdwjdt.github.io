<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4024</h4><p>4024. About a bathing place<p>There appeared a Bath with a long bench or (Lafwe <sup>1</sup>) such as are in use with us. When the bath appeared, a great heat ran through me exactly like that of a Bath, where at one side I saw a woman, who presently disappeared into a cloud which, becoming rather black, sank down under [the water]. On the bench appeared what seemed to be three little children - but they were not visible who presently spoke, saying that they did not want to be there. But what these things symbolize, the spirits conjectured in various ways, but I still do not know.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedish for "sweating bench." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4024</h4><p>4024. CONCERNING A BATH.<p>There appeared a bath with a long bench, or Lafwe, <sup>1</sup>such as is common with us. When the bath appeared, a sensation of great heat pervaded me just as in the case of a real bath. I then beheld, on one side, a woman, who presently vanished into a cloud, which becoming black sunk out of sight. Upon the bench there was an appearance of three infants, but they were not clearly seen, though they presently spoke and said they did not wish to be there. What these things signified was a matter of various conjecture with the attendant spirits, but I do not yet know.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;A Swedish word, signifying couch. </p>

De Balneo<p>Apparebat Balneum cum tali scamno longo seu (Lafwe sicut apud nos, cum appareret balneum, recurrebat mihi calor magnus prorsus sicut Balnei, ibi videbam ad unum latus mulierem, quae mox disparebat in nubem, quae nigrior facta, demergebatur; super scamnum apparebant sicut infantes tres, sed non visi, qui mox loquebantur, dicentes, quod ibi non esse vellent, sed quid haec significant, varie conjectarunt spiritus, sed nondum scio. </p>
