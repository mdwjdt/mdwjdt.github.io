<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5259</h4><p>5259. The rest went on further by a circular route all the way to the east and there spread themselves into this broad and extensive space more toward the back. Those were brought there who acknowledged God the Father and the Son as a Prophet and as being together with the Father, as well as being in the sun. Consequently the better ones were there. That broad, extensive space was also divided into mountains and valleys on which they were arranged. And it is well for them there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5259</h4><p>5259. The rest went on, by a circuitous way, still farther to the east; and there they spread themselves over a large and extensive space somewhat to the back. Those were brought thither who acknowledged God the Father, and the Son as a Prophet, and [that He], together with the Father, [was] also in the sun. Here, therefore, were the better ones. That ample and wide space was also divided into mountains and valleys, upon which they were arranged; and there they fare well. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5259 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5259. Reliqui pergebant per circuitum ulterius usque ad orientem, et ibi se diffundebant in spatium amplum ac extensum ad tergum magis; illuc perlati illi qui Deum Patrem agnoverunt, et Filium ut Prophetam, et apud Patrem, etiam in sole, ibi itaque erant meliores, spatium illud amplum et extensum etiam divisum est in montes et valles, super quae ordinati, et ibi illis bene est. </p>
