<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2603</h4><p>2603. Souls in the other life are without the kind of bonds by which they were restrained in the life of the body<p>While they are in the world, many bonds of society restrain people, such as fear of the law, fear for reputation, fear of the loss of life, fear of the loss of profit, respect, and the like, thus of all the desirables a person loves. These bonds in the other life cease, so they are left to their own inward qualities, being almost different people. They are liable to attack anyone they can, fearlessly doing them injury; others they harass verbally and in other ways, although in the life of the body, no such thing was heard about them in public. 1748, 14 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2603</h4><p>2603. THAT SOULS IN THE OTHER LIFE ARE FREE FROM SUCH BONDS AS [RESTRAINED] THEM IN THE LIFE OF THE BODY. <p>When men are in the world many bonds of society restrain them; for instance, fear of the law, fear of reputation, fear of loss of life, fear of loss of gain, of honor and the like, thus everything [belonging to] the cupidities which man loves. These bonds cease in the other life, wherefore being left to their interiors, they are, as it were, other [persons]; they are wont to infest everyone they can without fear; they revile; they provoke others with words and the like, although in the life of the body no such thing was heard from them in public. - 1748, July 14. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2603 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2603. Quod animae in altera vita sint absque vinculis talibus, quibus in vita corporis<p>Dum in mundo sunt, plura vincula societatis tenent homines, sicut timor legis, timor famae, timor jacturae vitae, timor jacturae lucri, honoris, et similium, ita omnium <sup>1</sup></p><p>cupiditatum, quas homo amat; haec vincula in altera vita cessant, quare interioribus suis relicti, alii quasi sunt, infestare solent quemcunque possunt, absque timore, convitiantur, alios verbis lacessunt, et similibus, quamvis in vita corporis, nihil tale ab iis, in publico auditum. 1748, 14 Julius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;in J.F.I.
