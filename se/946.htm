Thus disfigured, the person, with seemingly outstretched arms, is whirled around, the arms extended and motionless - which are not arms, only rags, slightly white, stretched out in this way. And as his body keeps being spun around, he is carried toward heaven, and it is proclaimed in front of all that he is of this [revengeful] character, so that the deepest shame may seize him. Thus he must become a supplicant, pleading [for forgiveness], and it is dictated to him what he must say in his plea. </p>

The spirit is then whirled around with something filthy, as if it were arms, stretched out and immovable; they are not arms, but only rags, somewhat white. The body, being stretched out in this way and continually rotated, is carried towards heaven, and, that he may be struck to the inmosts with shame, it is proclaimed before all that he is of such a quality. Thus he must become a supplicant and must beg for pardon. What he must say in his supplication is dictated to him. </p>
