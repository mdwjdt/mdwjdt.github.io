<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵界经历》 第148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>148.发生在人身上的每一件和一切坏事，即便不是故意的，都来自恶灵，因为这就是恶灵的本性。<p>恶灵会激发情感，连同信念或劝服，在那些信靠自己，并将一切归于自己的判断之人里面尤其如此；因为这些人将一切都归功于自己，自认为是最有智慧的人。而事实上，他们的智慧是疯狂，他们本人则完全发疯了，因为智慧要根据它所关注的目的来判断，他们将自己引向一个系地狱的目的。<p>恶灵尤其想成为圣灵，认为主离了他们什么也做不了。但有人问他们，这样的圣灵是从谁发出的？不是从外邦人的某个神来的吗？还是来自巴力，或某个其他神？<p>古教会的言语就像地上的乐园，他们凭地上的乐园觉察天上的乐园。先知书中的话就是这样，因为通过所阅读先知书中的话就能明白属灵和属天的事物。但随着时间的推移，这天上的乐园变成纯世俗和地上的乐园。由于弥赛亚神的降临，从地上乐园到天上乐园的大门被打开。当祂在荣耀中降临时，这大门将再次被打开。<p>在正经历重生的人里面，理解力的事物首先到来；在已经重生的人里面，意愿的事物首先到来。人通过贪欲或野心从世界形成，并进入由此而来的理性事物；但他通过理解力被重新形成，好叫意愿能得以改造。这一切通过理性事物，同时通过进入理性事物的属天事物实现。仁爱，因而一个新性情由此而来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 148</h4><p>148. The bad things that happen to a person are all and each one from evil spirits, even if not deliberately, because it is their nature [to inflict harm]. [Bad (Evil); Spirit]<p>148. 1/2. Evil spirits inspire feelings together with conviction, especially [in people] who trust in themselves and ascribe everything to their own judgment; for these credit themselves for everything and think themselves most wise, when yet their wisdom is insanity. For wisdom should be judged by the end [in view], but these are guiding themselves toward an end which is hell. See also Knowledge, Philosophy, Learned, Preach. [Wisdom; Conviction; End; Hell]<p>Sometimes those who think themselves the wisest are the most insane. See Wisdom. [Insanity]<p>148. 1:3. Evil spirits believe especially that they are the holy spirit and that the Lord can do nothing without them. But they were asked from whom they go forth, whether it was not from some god of the heathens, baal or some other. [Holy; Spirit; Gods]<p>[This third section of threshold materials consists of three annotations found in front of the Bible Index of Isaiah and Jeremiah and apparently belonging to Spiritual Experiences.]<p>[148 1:4.]<p>The speech of the ancient Church was like an earthly paradise from which they discerned the heavenly one. The speech of the Prophets is like this, for by what one reads there, spiritual and heavenly matters are to be understood. But in the course of time, that heavenly paradise was changed into a merely worldly and earthly one. At the coming of God the Messiah, the gate from the earthly paradise to the heavenly one was opened; and at His Coming into glory, it is to be opened again.<p>[1747] <sup>1</sup><p>[148 1:5.]<p>For one who is being regenerated, matters of understanding come first; for one who has been regenerated, matters of the will come first. A person is formed by the world through ambitions, and the resulting education, but is [then] formed anew through the understanding, so that the will may be reformed. This takes place by means of matters of understanding and, at the same time, things heavenly entering into them, bringing Charity, and thus a [new] character.<p>[148 1:6.]<p>1747, the 7th day of August (old calendar): a change of state in me, [introducing me] into the heavenly Kingdom, in figure. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The year 1747 is deleted in the manuscript.<br><br>2.&nbsp;In this passage the translator takes "in Imagine" to refer to Swedenborg's projected image in that Kingdom as a man, while actually still living in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 148</h4><p>148. [THAT ALL EVIL HAPPENINGS ARE FROM EVIL SPIRITS] <p>Each and every one of the evils that happen to man are from evil spirits, even though not premeditated, and this because such is their nature. (Malum, Spiritus.) <p>148 1/2. Evil spirits, especially those who trust in themselves and attribute everything to their own prudence, inspire affections together with persuasion; for there is nothing that they do not arrogate to themselves, thinking themselves to be the wisest of men. Their wisdom, however, is insanity, and they themselves are utterly insane, because wisdom is known from its end, and they lead themselves to an end which is hell. <p>(Finis, Infernum, Insania, Persuasio, Sapientia.) <p>148 1/3. Evil spirits especially wish to be the Holy Spirit, and think that without them God Messiah can do nothing. But it was asked, From whom do [such holy spirits] proceed? Was it not from some god of the gentiles? From Baal? Or some other god? (Dii, Sanctum, Spiritus). <p>[The following statements are found at the beginning of Codex 6, the first two at the bottom of the inside of the cover, and the third at the top of the page opposite. They are inserted here for the reasons given in the Special Preface.] <sup>1</sup><p>The speech of the Ancient Church was like an earthly paradise from which they perceived the heavenly. The speech of the Prophets was similar, for by means of the things that are read there spiritual and heavenly things are to be understood. But in process of time this heavenly paradise was changed into what was merely worldly and earthly. By the Advent of God Messiah the gate from the earthly paradise to the heavenly was opened, and at His Advent into glory, that gate is again to be opened. <sup>2</sup><p>In one who is to be regenerated intellectual things precede; in one who is regenerated voluntary things precede. Man is formed from the world by means of cupidities, and [he enters] into intellectual things therefrom; but he is reformed by means of intellectual things, so that the will may be reformed. This is effected by means of intellectual things, and at the same time by means of heavenly things which enter intellectual things. Hence comes charity, and hence a man's disposition. 1747, 7th August, old style: A change of state in me, into the heavenly kingdom, in an image. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For a transcript of the Latin, see at the end of this volume, p. 418. Codex 6 (Index Biblicus, vol. 1), clearly showing the position of these statements, has been reproduced in vol. IV of the Phototype Edition of Swedenborg's MSS. at p. 356. They are also reproduced less perfectly at p. 1164 of vol. X of the Photolithographed Edition. <p>2.&nbsp;Crossed off: "1747". </p>
