<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3129</h4><p>3129. So spirits are in a more perfect state than when they were people on earth, in order to be like they are, for they are held in it by the Lord. The difference is about the same as that between hearing, and sight separate from hearing- which they have because the memory of personal things has been separated from them. If they were to think at the same time from this memory in the other life together with other spirits, who [think] in mental images, the memory of personal things would be so disrupted that it would become entirely insane. 1748, 12 Sept. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3129</h4><p>3129. Wherefore spirits are in a more perfect state than when men, in order to be of such a character; for they are thus kept by the Lord; with nearly [the same] difference, that there is between hearing, and sight separate from hearing which they derive from this, that the memory of particulars is separated from them; from which if they should think in the other life, at the same time they were with other spirits who are in ideas, the memory of particulars would be so burst asunder as to become wholly insane. - 1748, September 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3129 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3129. Quare spiritus in perfectiore statu sunt, quam dum homines, ut tales esse possint, nam sic tenentur a Domino; cum differentia fere, sicut se habet auditus ad visum separatum ab auditu; quod habent inde, quod separata ab iis sit memoria particularium, ex qua si simul cogitarent in altera vita tunc cum aliis spiritibus, qui in ideis sunt, disrumperetur ita memoria particularium, ut prorsus insaniret. 1748, 12 Sept. </p>
