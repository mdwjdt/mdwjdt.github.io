<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5825</h4><p>5825. About the English and the Dutch in general<p>About the English. They have a different character than the other nations in Europe. A more inward light appears with them which is such that those who think about God and about religion accept spiritual truth more quickly than others; they do not let these down into in their earthly part so much since this is not so much taken up with and full of bodily loves and consequently not so much in the dark. Consequently they have a quite accurate perception when something is stated rationally and an inward sight that is a way of seeing that accepts on sight. This appears with them in the spiritual world, and on this account they are also at the center of the Christians, for those who have inward light are at the center. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5825</h4><p>5825. THE ENGLISH AND DUTCH IN GENERAL. <p>The English. - They are of a different nature to the other nations in Europe. Interior light [lux] appears with them, which is such that those who think about God and religion receive spiritual truth more quickly than others. They do not let those things down into the natural so much, since this is not so largely occupied and filled with the loves of the body, and not so darkened. Hence they have quite an exquisite perception when anything is said from reason, and possess interior sight, which is the sight of receptive intuition. This is apparent with them in the spiritual world: wherefore, also, in that world, they are in the midst amongst the Christians; for, there, those are in the midst who are in interior light [lux]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5825 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5825. De Anglis et Hollandis in genere<p>De Anglis. Quod alio genio sint, quam aliae nationes in Europa, quod lux interior apud illos appareat, quae talis est ut citius quam alii recipiant verum spirituale, qui cogitant de Deo et de religione, quod non ita demittant illa in naturale, quoniam hoc non ita occupatum est et plenum corporeorum amorum, et inde non ita obscurum; quod inde receptionem satis exquisitam habent cum aliquid dicitur ex ratione, et quod interiorem visum, qui est visus intuitivis receptivus, hoc apparet apud illos in mundo spirituali, quapropter etiam ibi in medio sunt inter Christianos, nam in medio sunt ibi qui in interiore luce. </p>
