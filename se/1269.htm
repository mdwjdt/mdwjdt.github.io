<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1269</h4><p>1269. The same spirit who was found out to have killed a certain innocent person with poison [<a href="1260.htm">1260-1266</a>], appears to have been such a one as not to desist for any reason, however true, from the passion for vengeance even unto death. He tarried with me, and he was of the kind that all the reasons told to him were not the least bit valid, and did not even enter his field of vision. They were like nothing, even to the point that when I realized this, I saw that he was not like a human being, who is open to reasons from other people and turns them over in his mind, but like a beast. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1269</h4><p>1269. That same spirit who had been shown to have murdered a certain innocent person by poison [n. <a href="../se/1260.htm">1260</a> ] appears to have been such that [he could not] from any reason, however true, desist from the desire of revenging even unto death. He stayed with me, and he was such that all the reasons which were mentioned were of no avail whatever, as they did not even enter into his perception, but were as nothing. Perceiving this at length, I also perceived that he was not like a man who admits the reasons of men and turns them over in his mind, but like a beast. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1269 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1269. Idem spiritus, de quo detectum, quod innocentem quendam veneno necaverit [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1269/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_1260" target=_top>1260-1266</a>], is apparet fuisse talis, ut desistere [nequiret] <sup>1</sup></p><p>ulla ratione, utcunque vera, a cupidine vindicandi usque ad mortem, is jacuit apud me, et talis erat, ut omnes rationes, quae dicerentur, nequicquam valerent, sic ut non intrarent in ejus perceptionem, sed essent quasi nihil, usque dum, hoc percipiens, percepi, quod non similis esset homini, qui hominum rationes admittit, et mente volvit, sed similis bestiae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;sic in J.F.I. Tafel's edition </p>
