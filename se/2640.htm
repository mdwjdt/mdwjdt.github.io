<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2640</h4><p>2640. As for the "files" <sup>1</sup>there spoken of, they are wide drills (borar <sup>2</sup>) with which they bore people through, and indeed from the front through the chest. These are three kinds of tools that the hellish spirits seem to themselves to be using with the greatest pleasure, by whom David was taught when he came into his cruel state - which shows what he had been like.<p>As for his Psalms, he did not speak the least word, but the spirit of the Lord through him, because he was king, and that kind of king. But whatever in them concerned the Messiah and His Kingdom, David had applied to himself. For such as a person's title is, so he perceives himself.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No doubt referring to the "saws," by which they were tortured-not, as NKJV has it, "put to work with saws."<br><br>2.&nbsp;Swedish for "bores." </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2640</h4><p>2640. Respecting the harrows [files] [limes], [mentioned] in the same place, they are broad [bavar], wherewith they thrust men through, yea, the part [region] of his breast: these are the three kinds of instruments which the infernal [spirits]) seem to themselves to use with the greatest pleasantness, whom David taught when he was in his cruelty; hence of what quality he has been may be evident; and as respects his psalms, he did not speak the least word, but the spirit of the Lord through him, because a king, and of such a character; but whatever [is written] there concerning the Messiah and his kingdom, he had applied to himself, for everyone feels in such a manner as is his quality. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2640 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2640. Quod per limas ibid. [intelligitur], sunt lati (bacrar {a}) quibus perfodiunt homines, et quidem pectoralem <sup>1</sup></p><p>ejus partem: haec tria genera instrumentorum sunt, quibus sibi uti cum maxima jucunditate videntur infernales, [per] quos edoctu <sup>2</sup></p><p>s David, cum in crudelitate sua fuit, inde qualis fuerit constare potest: et quod psalmos ejus attinet, is non loquutus minimam vocem, sed spiritus Domini per eum, quia rex, et talis, sed quicquid de Messia ibi, et Ipsius regno, ad semet adplicuerat; nam qualis quisque est, taliter sentit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has pectorem ut apparet<p>2.&nbsp;in J.F.I. Tafel's edition: "legerim per quos edoctus" </p>
