<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3601</h4><p>3601. Cunning ones like these who urge toward mercy and who had acquired such a persuasive faculty in bodily life, keep themselves below the occiput, both because they want to reign on the earth and in the heavens, and because they desire to operate incognito, having accustomed themselves in life not to want people to be aware of their tricks. They speak devoutly and compassionately with the people they are deceiving, but wickedly and cunningly among themselves; and they live wickedly. 1748, 17 Oct. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3601</h4><p>3601. Such then are the deceitful who persuade to compassion, and who have acquired this persuasion in the life of the body. They possess themselves of a place under the occiput, both because they wish to rule in heaven and earth, and because they desire to act covertly, for they were accustomed during life to act in such a manner that men should not detect their stratagems. They speak piously and mercifully with the men whom they deceive, wickedly and deceitfully with each other and within themselves, and live flagitiously. - 1748, October 17. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3601 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3601. Tales dolosi, qui persuadent misericordiam, et persuasionem acquisiverunt vita corporis, tenent se sub occipitio, tam quia regnare volunt in terris et in coelis, quam quod incognito agere cupiunt, ut enim homines non percipiant eorum dolos, assuefacti in vita: pie et misericorditer cum hominibus quos decipiunt, loquuntur; sceleste et dolose inter semet, et intra semet; et sceleste vivunt. 1748, 17 Oct. </p>
