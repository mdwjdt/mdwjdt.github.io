<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5179</h4><p>5179. About a mountain where there is marriage, heaven<p>I was carried toward the left by the Lord. This went on for an hour, and finally I arrived at a certain mountain where all were naked, wives and husbands, and I spoke with them at a distance. And they said that they were all naked, men and women, and that no one ever had a craving for another woman or was aroused by anything lascivious, and nonetheless they tenderly love their spouses. They said also that when they come to their dwellings they are all naked, the men and the women, and that their behavior is the same. And they said also that they cannot bear those who are clothed, men or women, because they are of a different nature. The reason they were such was that they had genuine marriage due to their having been such in the world.<p>They welcome whatever men or women come to them. However, they find out about them by having them undress and display themselves naked, the men or the women. Then they immediately perceive whether the spirit of marriage is in them. If it is not, they are driven away. Those who do not possess what makes marriage can feign it and put it on for some time with an illusion. But as soon as they are discovered, they are driven off. They realize what their nature is also by the fact that of their own accord they rush away from there as if they were running from a particular enemy, and rush so far that finally they cannot be seen, some into the distance, some into the deep. This was also seen happening, for certain ones like this who were with me fled off in this manner. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5179</h4><p>5179. CONCERNING A MOUNTAIN WHERE IS CONJUGIAL [CHASTITY]. HEAVEN.<p>I was carried by the Lord to the left. This lasted an hour, and, eventually, I arrived at a certain mountain, where all were naked, wives and husbands; and I spoke with them at a distance. They said that they were all naked, men and women; neither did one ever lust after another, nor was any lasciviousness called forth; and that, still, they loved their spouses tenderly. They said, further, that, when they come to their own dwellings, all, both men and women, are naked, and that then, in like manner, [they have neither lust nor lascivious thought]; and, also, that they cannot tolerate those men and women who are clothed, because they are of a different genius. The reason that they were of such a character, was, that they were in conjugial chastity, owing to the fact that they had been so in the world. They also admit to themselves whomsoever they please, of both sexes; but they explore them, by [causing them] to strip off their clothes, and present themselves, let them be men or women, naked. They then, at once, perceive whether the conjugial [state] is with them. If not, they are driven away from the place. Some who have not the conjugial [state], are able to feign it, and, by means of phantasies, to assume it for some time; but as soon as they are detected they are driven away: [they are discovered, also,] by their rushing from thence, of themselves, as from some enemy, and so far, that at length they cannot be been. Some go far away, some deep down, as also was seen. Some of those of such a character, who were with me, fled away in this manner. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5179 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5179. De monte ubi conjugiale, coelum<p>Vectus sum a Domino ad sinistrum, quod perstabat per horam, et tandem perventum est ad quendam montem, ubi omnes erant nudi, uxores et mariti, et ad distantiam cum illis loquutus sum, et dicebant quod omnes essent nudi ac nudae, nec usquam unus appeteret alteram vel excitaretur aliqua lascivia, et quod usque amarent suas conjuges tenere, tum quod cum ad aedes suas veniunt, omnes sint nudi et nudae, et quod tunc similiter; et quoque quod non tolerare possint illos qui vestiti vel vestitae sunt, quia alio genio sunt; causa quod tales essent, erat quod in conjugiali sincero essent, ex eo quod tales fuerint in mundo, admittunt etiam quoslibet et quaslibet ad se, sed explorant illos per exuere vestes et sistere se nudos vel nudas, tunc statim percipiunt num illis conjugiale sit, si non, inde abiguntur; qui non conjugiale habent, possunt hoc fingere et per phantasias assumere quoad aliquod temporis, sed ut primum deteguntur, abiguntur, et quoque per id quod ipsi ruant inde sicut a quodam hoste, et tam longe, ut tandem non possint apparere, quidam in longum quidam in profundum, quod etiam visum est, quidam enim tales qui apud me ita aufugerunt. </p>
