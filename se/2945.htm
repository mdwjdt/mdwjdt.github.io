So since it is the truth that the person only seems to be [guilty], because of being thus driven by others, and is [confirmed] in the truth, the evil is then not accounted to him or her. But one cannot be [confirmed] in that truth unless one has faith in the Lord, for the Lord keeps one in a different thinking, permitting evil spirits to act in this way for the sake of temptation, so that it may be turned to one's good-so those who are not in the Lord cannot say this, because there is no one liberating them, and they cannot liberate themselves.<p>So the evil is not accounted [to one who has faith]. </p>

Wherefore since it is the truth, that he only seems to be [guilty], because thus moved [actus] by others, and when he is in the truth, then [evil] is not imputed to him: but he cannot be in that truth unless he is in faith in the Lord, for the Lord holds him, in another thought, and permits evil spirits to act so, on good. Wherefore they who are not in the Lord, cannot say this, because they have no liberator. They cannot liberate themselves. Thus evil is not imputed. </p>
