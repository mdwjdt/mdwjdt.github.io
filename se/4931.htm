<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4931</h4><p>4931. How great the wickedness is of those who come there can scarcely be described because it is ineffable. It comes into existence chiefly through the misuse of correspondences and symbolic displays, arts unknown in the world.</p><p>[2] In some cases they present themselves naked and this way appear above as if they were innocent beings and under the guise of innocence, commit crimes. Some learn the spiritual language, using which they join themselves with certain angels and commit crimes. However, the spiritual language they have is not like that of those who are in heaven but is an artificial one, and they do not speak in it with spiritual mental images but with earthly ones, which is entirely forbidden. Some devise another language for themselves and associate with each other in this way so that what they are saying among themselves is not understood by others. However, others do otherwise, in thousands and thousands of ways. In a word, the wickedness there is unspeakable. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4931</h4><p>4931. How great is the wickedness of those who come thither can scarcely be described, as it is inexpressible. It especially takes place by the abuse of correspondences and representatives - arts that are unknown in the world. In some cases, they present themselves naked, and so appear above as innocents, and, under the guise of innocence, perpetrate ill deeds. Some learn, in addition, the spiritual language, whereby they conjoin themselves with certain angels, and thus perpetrate ill deeds; but they do not have such a spiritual language as they have who are in heaven, but an artificial one; and they speak by it, not in spiritual but in natural ideas - which is altogether forbidden. Some devise for themselves another language, and so associate themselves that what they speak amongst themselves is not perceived by others; but others act differently, in thousands and thousands of ways. In a word, the wickedness there is indescribable. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4931 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4931. Quanta malitia sit illorum, qui illuc veniunt, vix describi potest, quia est ineffabilis, fit imprimis per abusum correspondentiarum, et repraesentativorum, quae artes in mundo ignotae sunt.<p>[2] In quibusdam sistunt se nudos, et sic apparent supra sicut innocentes, ac sub specie innocentiae facinora patrant. Quidam addiscunt linguam spiritualem, per quam se conjungunt cum angelis quibusdam, et sic patrant facinora, sed illis non est lingua spiritualis, qualis illis qui in coelo, sed est artificialis, et non per illam loquuntur ideis spiritualibus sed ideis naturalibus, quod prorsus vetitum; quidam sibi aliam linguam excogitant, et sic se consociant, ut non percipiantur ab aliis quid inter se loquuntur; alii autem aliter, mille et mille modis, verbo est malitia ibi ineffabilis. </p>
