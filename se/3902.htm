<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3902</h4><p>3902. I noticed, as I had several times earlier, that these spirits, like others also, when I was walking through the streets and they had been with me for almost a day, yet because they had not been reflecting, had not observed anything at all - not even things that were right before my eyes, such as books, papers, and the like, even though they are able to see through my eyes. This shows what kind of spirits are with people through whom they do not see, and that they do not even care, or reflect on the matter, thus that they see and hear nothing that is with others. 1748, 7 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3902</h4><p>3902. I observed, as I had sometimes done before, that these spirits, as well as others, when I walked through the streets, and they had been with me during nearly the whole day, yet, from their not reflecting, they had observed nothing, not even the objects that were before my eyes, as books, papers, and the like, although they could see through my eyes. Hence it appears what is the quality of the spirits with men, through whom they do not see, to wit, that they have no concern about anything [they see], neither do they reflect upon it, thus that they neither see nor hear anything with others. - 1748, November 7. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3902 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3902. Observabam, ut prius aliquoties, quod hi spiritus, sicut etiam alii, cum ambularem per plateas, et apud me fuissent per diem fere, tamen quia non reflecterunt, nihil observavissent, ne quidem quae ante oculos meos essent, ut libri, chartae, et similia, tametsi per oculos meos videre possunt, inde constat quales spiritus apud homines, per quos non vident, quod ne quidem hilum curent, aut reflectant super tale, sic quod nihil apud alios videant et audiant. 1748, 7 Nov. </p>
