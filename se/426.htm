<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>426.死者的灵魂若不保留自己的幻象，并被他们的幻象所引导，就无法被引入内在的知识，从而为天堂做好准备。如今，当信不复存在时，几乎没有人能在来世为天堂做好准备，因为在一个秩序颠倒的生命中只有感官的幻象或幻觉。这些幻象或幻觉留在灵魂中，也就是留在他们的属世心智或低层心智中；生活在今天的人们，其生命尤其集中在属世心智或低层心智。充满了如此多幻象的这类灵魂，并没有被破碎；也就是说，他们的幻象不能立刻被驱散或摆脱，因为这样他们就会被破碎，而他们自己的情感生命将一丝不剩，因为这生命纯由幻象构成。这一点可从大量经历得以证实，以至于毫无怀疑的余地。一切事物中都有一种疯狂，这种疯狂主宰并构成了这种人的生命。有一个人刚刚被那些与他一起行动的灵人抛弃；这时，他看上去好像并没有活着；当如此被剥夺了他的幻象时，他被认为是死了。但这仍只能证明一个人不能像这样进入来世。在这种状态下，他什么也学不到。（1747年12月30日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 426</h4><p>426. The souls of the dead, if they do not retain their fantasies and are not led by their fantasies, cannot be guided to inner knowledge, and thus prepared for Heaven<p>At this day, when there is no belief, hardly anyone could be made ready for heaven in the other life, because of the upside-down order of [their] life, unless nothing but fantasies prevail, or hallucinations of the senses. These reside in the [newly arrived] souls in their earthly or lower minds, where the main life of people living at this day centers.<p>Such souls, filled with so many fantasies, are not broken - that is, their fantasies cannot be dispelled or extinguished all at once, for thus they would be broken, and nothing of their own emotional life would be left, for it is composed of pure fantasy.<p>This is supported by so much evidence that there can be no doubt about it. There is an insanity in everything, which rules the life and makes up the life of [such] a person. Just now, a certain one was abandoned by the spirits who were functioning together with him, and it then appeared as if he were not alive; when thus deprived of his fantasies, he was thought to be dead. But even this could not prove anything, except that a person cannot enter into the other life like this. In such a condition, he can learn nothing. 1747, the 30th day of December. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 426</h4><p>426. UNLESS THEY RETAIN THEIR PHANTASIES, AND ARE LED BY THEIR PHANTASIES, THE SOULS OF THE DEAD CANNOT BE LED TO COGNITIONS, AND SO BE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN <p>At this day when there is no faith, and scarcely anyone could have been prepared for heaven in the other life, because in an inverted order of life, there are mere phantasies or hallucinations of the senses, which remain in souls, that is, in their natural mind, or "animus", where the life of the man living at this day especially is. This soul, full of so many phantasies, is not broken, that is, his phantasies cannot be immediately shaken off or extinguished, for thus the man would be broken and nothing as to his sensitive life would remain, for it is composed of mere phantasies. This can be confirmed from so many things that no doubt whatever can be raised against it. There is insanity in all things, and this insanity governs and composes the life of man. A certain one has now been left by the spirits who were acting together with him; he then appeared as though he were not alive, being thus deprived of phantasies. He was supposed to be as if dead. But still this could only demonstrate that such a man cannot enter into the other life; in such a state he can learn nothing. 1747, Dec. 30. </p>
