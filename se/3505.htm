<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3505</h4><p>3505. I heard still more, that they do not indeed acknowledge the Lord, even less that He rules the universe, but that they do acknowledge some supreme Being that governs. For they have been taught by their business experience that there is some kind of government - because one is successful, another is not however much he may struggle. For this reason also they pray and observe sacred rites, doing so for their own purposes and for other reasons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3505</h4><p>3505. I heard, moreover, that some [of them] do not acknowledge the Lord, still less that he rules the universe, and yet that they did acknowledge a certain supreme Being, which rules, for they are taught by their experience in business that there is such an overruling power, inasmuch as success crowns the efforts of one and not of another, how diligently soever he may labor. From this cause it is that they pray and perform sacred rites, having regard however to private ends and other considerations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3505 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3505. Audivi usque, quod quidem non agnoscant Dominum, minus quod Ipse regat universum, sed usque quod agnoscant supremum quoddam Ens, quod gubernat, nam edocti sunt a suis negotiationibus, quod tale regimen sit, quia uni succedit, alteri non, utcunque laborat. Ex hac causa etiam est quod orent, et sacros ritus obeant, ita propter fines suos, tum propter alias causas. </p>
