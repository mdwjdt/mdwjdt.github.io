<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2389</h4><p>2389. Since the spirits were of this character, they could obviously not be instructed easily, because if one has no knowledge of true faith in bodily life, such knowledge is usually not given to them as spirits. For the higher knowledge they had in the life of the body also remains after death, and is easily raised up again. This is clear to me from numerous conversations with souls after their death, for when they are told that their confession of faith during life was such and such, they at once acknowledge and know that it had been. And they know clearly that it had been such, like other higher concepts that they know and recognize when they are reminded of them, just as if they were still in the life of the body. From this one may infer what true knowledge of faith achieves after death, and what no knowledge achieves. 1748, 22 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2389</h4><p>2389. That spirits, when they had been such, could not have been easily instructed in the other life, is apparent from this: that if man has no true knowledges of faith in the life of the body, there cannot be given knowledge in the other life to such spirits; for the knowledges which they had in the life of the body also remain after death, and are easily revived, as is manifest to me from very many conversations with souls after death; for when they were told that of such a sort had been their confession of faith in life, they then immediately acknowledge and know that it had been such. It is the same with other knowledges, which when recalled to them, they know and acknowledge, just as if they were still in the life of the body. Hence it may be concluded what a true knowledge of faith may effect after death, and what no knowledge of faith [effects]. - 1748, June 22. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2389 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2389. Quod spiritus cum tales fuerint, non facile instrui potuerint in altera vita, constat ex eo, quod si nullae cognitiones verae fidei sint homini in vita corporis, in altera vita non dari solet cognitio spiritibus talibus, nam cognitiones quas habuerunt in vita corporis, etiam manent post mortem, et quod facile resuscitentur, ex perplurimis loquelis cum animabus post mortem mihi constat, nam cum iis dicitur quod talis fuerit eorum fidei confessio in vita, illico tunc agnoscunt et sciunt quod talis fuerit, et quoque manifeste sciunt, quod talis fuerit, similiter ac aliae cognitiones, quae dum iis revocantur, sciunt et agnoscunt, sicut adhuc essent in vita corporis. Inde concludi potest, quid vera cognitio fidei efficiat, post mortem, et quid nulla cognitio fidei. 1748, 22 Junius. </p>
