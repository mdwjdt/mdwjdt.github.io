<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 5311</h4><p>5311. Then all who were there, except some who had not been like this but who had lived well, were thrown into a certain quagmire, which is the fifth, on the other side of their dwelling. All of these were thrown there, and as a result the region was freed from such attacks. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5311</h4><p>5311. Then all who were there, except some who had not been of such a character but have lived well, were cast into a certain gulf, which is the fifth, on the other side of their dwellings. There, also, all of them were cast, and the region thus freed from the infestations of such ones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 5311 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>5311. Tunc omnes quae ibi, praeter aliquas quae non tales fuerant, sed vixerunt bene, conjectae sunt in voraginem quandam, quae quinta est, ab altera parte mansionum earum et ibi conjectae omnes illae, et sic tractus ab infestatione talium liberatus. </p>
