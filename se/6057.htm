<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 6057</h4><p>6057. About God as Man<p>That the truly human idea of God is of God-Man. That this is true is can be seen from these observations: 1) Everyone in the other life pictures God to himself as a Person, particularly those who are good, those who are evil as well. This was investigated in the case of many who when in the world had an idea of God as something invisible, or something spiritual like air before their eyes at a distance. But in spite of this, these same people in the other life all see God as a Person. This was investigated, and it was found out why this idea is in the spirit of a person: there are many things in a person's spirit which the person does not know are there, such as spiritual speech, the idea of space, and many other things; from these it follows that the idea of God as a Person is inborn in every person's spirit.</p><p>[2] 2) But in the world that idea was destroyed in those who began to think about three persons and separate the Lord's Human aspect from these, and then as a result of this made the three Gods invisible to themselves, 3) and then from an idea of spirit, which they say God is, they say that He is like an airy something, or a sort of white or dark cloud, 4) and in the case of those who attribute all things to nature, and consequently nothing to the Divine, these in the spiritual world make gods for themselves, all of whom have power, but still as humans. 5) The idea of God as a person is present with young boys, and with simple people, with women, in a word, with all who have not destroyed this idea as result of the reasons spoken of above. 6) This same idea continues to exist in all peoples, especially in Africans, who do not know what God who is not a person is. 7) With all the Ancients this idea existed before the time of Abraham and after it. They see God as a person; they call Him Jehovah, and Creator of the Universe. 8) This idea was with the Gentiles in ancient times; they acknowledged many gods, all of whom were human entities, about whom [it is written] in the Word, where they are mentioned, the names, etc. 9) With all the Greeks and Italians, this was the source of the Divine attributes from which came their gods, all of them human؊upiter, Phoebus, Venus, etc. 10) The inhabitants of other earths, about whom [I have written] in this small book <sup>1</sup>. 11) The Papists: They want to worship the Pope and acknowledge Divine power in him, they kiss his footsteps; and they want to worship saints as gods. 12) The reason this so happens is that it is from the inflow of heaven, which is received by every spirit, for heaven is the Divine in Human form. For this reason there cannot be any angel in heaven without this idea of God; and for this reason the Lord is acknowledged, even by gentiles.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e.

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 6057</h4><p>6057. GOD AS A MAN. <p>The truly human idea concerning God, is as of a God-Man. That it is so, may be evident from these circumstances: <p>(1) That everyone, in the other life, represents God to himself as a Man; the good especially, but also the evil. This was investigated, in the case of many, who, in the world, entertained the idea about God as of something invisible, or as of something spiritual, as it were aerial, at a great distance before the eyes. But, still, all these same persons, in the other life, see God as a Man. It was investigated and found to be so: it is because that idea is in man's spirit. There are many things in man's spirit which the man does not know are there; such as spiritual speech, the idea of space, and many others. From these facts it follows, that the idea of every single man, deeply rooted in his spirit, is of God as a Man. <p>(2) But that idea has been destroyed in the world with those who began to think of Three Persons, and to separate the Lord's Human from them, and hence made themselves three invisible Gods; <p>(3) [as is evident], also, from the idea of spirits who say that God is as it were something aerial, or nebulous, either bright or dark. <p>(4) [The former idea] is destroyed, also, with those who attribute everything to nature, and consequently nothing to the Divine; these, in the spiritual world, make to themselves gods of all who excel in power, but still esteem them as men. <p>(5) Children, the simple-minded, women, in a word all who have not destroyed that idea through the causes mentioned above, have the idea of God as of a Man. <p>(6) The same idea remains with all gentiles, especially with Africans, who cannot conceive what a God who is not Man, is. <p>(7) That idea was held by all the ancients, before and after the times of Abraham: they saw God as a Man, and called Him Jehovah and Creator of the Universe. <p>(8) It existed with the gentiles in ancient times, who acknowledged many gods all of which were men; - respecting whom see the places in the Word where they are named. <p>(9) Also, with all the Greeks and Italians; hence the Divine attributes from which their gods [take their origin] all as men, -Jupiter, Apollo, Venus, etc. <p>(10) So, likewise, the inhabitants of other earths, respecting whom see my pamphlet. <sup>1</sup><p>(11) Papists, also, in that they are willing to worship the Pope, and to acknowledge Divine power in him - and kiss his footprints - and in that they are willing to adore saints as gods. <p>(12) The reason that this is so, is from the influx of heaven, which is received by every spirit; for heaven is the Divine in Human form: wherefore, no one can be an angel in heaven without that idea of God; on which account, the Lord is acknowledged, even by gentiles. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The treatise On the Earths in the Universe is the one referred to. -TR. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 6057 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>6057. De Deo ut Homine<p>Quod idea vere humana de Deo, sit ut de Deo Homine, quod ita sit constare potest ex his<p>1) quod unusquisque in altera vita, sistat sibi Deum ut Hominem, imprimis boni, etiam mali, hoc exploratum apud multos, qui in mundo habuerant ideam de Deo ut de invisibili, aut sicut de spirituali sicut aereum, ante oculos e longinquo, sed usque iidem omnes in altera vita vident Deum ut Hominem, exploratum est et inventum, quare in spiritu hominis est illa idea, sunt multa in spiritu hominis, quae homo nescit quod ibi sint, sicut loquela spiritualis, sicut idea spatii et plura; ex his sequitur quod cujusvis hominis idea insita in spiritu ejus sit de Deo ut Homine.<p>2) Sed quod illa idea in mundo apud illos destructa sit, qui coeperunt de tribus personis cogitare, et separare ab illis Domini Humanum, inde tum invisibiles sibi fecerunt tres Deos,<p>3) tum ex idea spiritus, quem dicunt Deum esse, quod sit aliquod sicut aereum seu nebulosum candidum aut obscurum,<p>4) tum apud illos qui naturae tribuerunt omnia, et sic nihil Divino, hi in mundo spirituali faciunt sibi deos, omnes qui potentia valent, sed usque ut homines.<p>5) Idea Dei ut hominis, est apud pueros, et apud simplices, apud mulieres, verbo apud omnes qui non destruxerunt ideam illam per causas supra dictas.<p>6) Manet eadem idea apud omnes gentes, imprimis apud Africanos, qui non sciunt quid Deus non homo.<p>7) Apud Antiquos omnes fuit illa idea ante Abrahami tempora et post illa, viderunt Deum ut hominem, vocarunt Ipsum Jehovam, et Creatorem Universi.<p>8) Apud Gentiles antiquis temporibus, qui plures deos, omnes qui fuerunt homines, agnoverunt, de quibus in Verbo ubi nominantur, nomina etc.<p>9) Apud Graecos et Italos omnes, inde attributa Divina ex quibus dii eorum, omnes ut homines, Jupiter, Phoebus, Venus etc. 10) Incolae aliarum tellurum, de quibus in eo tractatu. <sup>1</sup></p><p>11) Pontificii quod colere velint Papam, et agnoscere in illo Divinam potestatem, osculari vestigia ejus; et quod adorare velint sanctos sicut deos. 12) Causa quod ita sit, est ex influxu coeli, qui ab omni siritu recipitur, coelum enim est Divinum in forma Humana; quare non potest aliquis angelus in coelo esse absque illa idea Dei, quare agnoscitur Dominus, etiam a gentilibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;h.e.
