<p>595.关于最有学问者当中的一个人。有一个灵人曾因其教义而极负盛名，最为著名，他从下面，因而从低地上到我这里来。他是寒冷的，我从冷风中明显感觉到了这一点。他说，他听见我与其他人交谈，他对属天和属灵的事物一无所知，尽管他曾是写作这类主题的领军人物之一。就连一个低级的灵人都十分清楚的事，他都不明白，甚至不想去学习。因此，他被告诫说，这在来世是必要的事。他不知道自己在来世。（1748年1月27日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 595</h4><p>595. About someone among the most learned<p>One spirit who had been extremely famous and most acclaimed on account of his doctrines, came upwards toward me from below, thus from the lower earth. He was cold, as I plainly felt from the cold blast. He said that he had heard what I had discussed with others, but that of the heavenly and spiritual things, he had understood nothing, even though he had been one of the main writers on those subjects; nor did he understand what even a spirit of the lower sort knows, or even want to learn it. He was therefore rebuked and told that this was one thing necessary in this life. He did not know that he was in the other life. 1748, the 27th day of January. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 595</h4><p>595. CONCERNING ONE WHO HAD BEEN AMONG THE MOST LEARNED <p>A spirit, who had been one of the most famous and among the most celebrated on account of his doctrines, applied himself to me from beneath upwards, thus from the lower earth. He was cold, as I manifestly felt from a cold breeze. He said that he had heard that I spoke with others, but because it was about celestial and spiritual things he could understand nothing, although he had been among the leading men to write about such matters. He could not understand what a spirit of the lower sort knew well, nor indeed did he want to learn; therefore he was admonished that this was the one thing necessary in this life. He did not know that he was in the other life. 1748, Jan. 27. </p>
