<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4257</h4><p>4257. How spirits act upon man<p>It was shown me by actual experience how spirits arouse the thoughts of people on earth, speak just as they think, or the person thinks as the spirits speak, and in fact those nearest as if in sleep, not knowing otherwise than that they are the people. Whatever they arouse and then discuss among themselves, both having the same mental imagery. These spirits are very nearby, or mediums, but into them flow those farther away, and differently; and so on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4257</h4><p>4257. HOW SPIRITS ACT UPON MAN.<p>It was shown me by lively experience in what manner spirits excite the thoughts of man. They speak as man thinks, or man thinks as they speak, and those that are nearest as if in sleep, knowing no otherwise than that they are themselves the men. Whatever things they excite and speak of among each other, these the man thinks, both being in a similar idea. But there are spirits who are very near, or are subjects, and into them flow those that are more remote, but sometimes otherwise, and so on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4257 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4257. Quomodo spiritus agunt hominem<p>O stensum mihi per vivam experientiam quomodo spiritus excitant cogitationes hominum, loquuntur sicut homo cogitat, seu sicut loquuntur homo cogitat, et quidem proximi quasi in somno, nescientes aliter quam quod homines sint, quae excitant et ita inter se loquuntur, homo cogitat, sunt in simili idea; sed spiritus sunt proximi seu subjecta, at in illos influunt remotiores, et quidem aliter, et sic porro. </p>
