<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4292</h4><p>4292. <sup>1</sup>About dwellings and paradisal surroundings<p>Angels have their own habitations where they dwell, which are magnificent. I have been there, and I have seen them several times, and marveled. They are so real and visible to them that anything more real and visible could not exist.</p><p>[2] The dwellings on earth, those of people on earth, are hardly anything in comparison, and they even call those on earth dead, not real, but their own they call true dwellings, as if they were alive, and real, for they enjoy them with every sense.</p><p>[3] The architecture is the very source of art itself, so it could never be described in its much variety.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This paragraph is emphasized marginally in the manuscript by a wavy vertical line. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4292</h4><p>4292. CONCERNING HABITATIONS AND PARADISIACAL THINGS.<p>The angels have their own habitations where they dwell, which are magnificent. I have been there and have seen them at times, and that with wonder, so manifest and conspicuous are they; nothing in fact can be more so. The habitations which are on the earth, or of man, are comparatively scarcely anything. They call those which are on the earth dead and not real, but their own true, as if alive and real, for they enjoy them with all sense. The architecture is such that the art itself is thence, so that they can never be described; they exist too in vast variety. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4292 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4292. De habitaculis et paradisiacis<p>Angeli habent sua habitacula, ubi sunt, quae sunt magnifica, fui ibi, vidi aliquoties, et miratus, sunt iis tam manifesta et conspicua, ut non dari queat magis manifestum, et conspicuum: habitacula quae sunt in terra, seu hominum, vix quicquam sunt respective, etiam vocant ea quae in tellure, mortua, non realia, sed sua vera, quasi viva et realia, nam omni sensu illis fruuntur: architectura est talis, ut ipsa ars inde, sic ut nusquam describi possit, cum multa varietate. </p>
