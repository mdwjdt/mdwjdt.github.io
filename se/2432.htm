<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2432</h4><p>2432. It has also become known to me by countless experiences that the persuasions of spirits coupled with desire, which I thought to be salutary and very good, were changed to the opposite persuasions after several moments, hours, or days.<p>In order that I might know for certain that the Lord controls humanity's thoughts, prudence and plannings, and that one must have faith in Him, not in oneself - and since it is the truth and not to be doubted, just as we do not doubt when a truth is presented to the very eyesight, we still believe it because we see it, even if we do not know the causes and just as with researchers, even if they do not find the causes, they still believe it, because they see it - therefore I have now seen, heard, felt, and learned that it is a truth not to be doubted, and consequently not to be reasoned about as to whether it is so simply because I do not understand (for I do not know whether such reasonings come from spirits). But because it is so in truth, it must be believed even more than the senses because the Lord has said it. 1748, 28 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2432</h4><p>2432. This was also made known to me by innumerable experiences, that the persuasions of spirits with cupidity, which I supposed to be salutary and the best, were changed, after some moments, hours [or] days into contrary persuasions; so that hence I knew for certain, that the Lord alone rules the thoughts of man, his prudence and counsels, and that faith should be placed in him, but not in self, and as this is the truth, no doubt should be entertained; just as when ocular truth is given, although we do not know causes, yet we believe, and though explorers do not discover the causes, still we believe, because they see. Now I have seen, heard, felt, [and] known this to be an indubitable truth - wherefore it should not be argued about, as is usual, because I do not know, whether it is a spirit, whether it be so [and so] because I do not understand; but because the thing is so in truth we should believe it sooner than sensuals because the Lord also has said it. - 1748, June 28. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2432 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2432. Hoc innumeris quoque experientiis mihi notum factum est, quod persuasiones spirituum cum cupiditate, quas putabam esse salutares et optimas, post aliquot momenta, horas, dies, sint mutatae in persuasiones contrarias; ut inde scirem pro certo, quod Dominus Solus regat cogitationes hominis, ejus prudentiam, et consilia, et quod Ipsi fides habenda, non autem sibi, et cum veritas, non dubitandum, sicut dum datur veritas ocularis, tametsi non novimus causas, usque credimus, et licet exploratores non inveniunt causas, usque credunt, quia vident; nunc hoc vidi, audivi, sensi, novi, quod veritas sit indubitata, quare non ratiocinandum, ut solet--quia <sup>1</sup></p><p>non scio num sit spiritus--num <sup>2</sup></p><p>ita sit, quia non intelligo, sed quia res ita est in veritate, credendum plus quam sensualibus quia Dominus etiam dixit. 1748, 28 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;In the Manuscript externus in externis emendatum esse videtur; in J.F.I.
