<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3109</h4><p>3109.

The mildness of their influx also shows this: but they craftily lie in wait: as often as occasion is given, and they see that man falls, they then assist with every effort, so that he may fall headlong. I spoke with them, and they are present when I write. </p>
