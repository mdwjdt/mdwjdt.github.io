<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3449</h4><p>3449. Moreover, he also liked to substitute innocent people, so that when he was to blame, he would substitute innocent people, even persuade others that any he knew to be innocent were to blame, so that he not only exonerated himself, but convinced others that the thing is lawful. So he substituted whomsoever he encountered - something which those do who are without conscience, and who have no love toward others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3449</h4><p>3449. He desired also to inveigle the innocent, as when anything was charged upon him, he would fain substitute the innocent [in his place], pretending that even those whom he knew to be innocent were liable to the same charge; and this that he might not only exculpate himself, but also persuade others that it was lawful thus to substitute whomsoever he could find. In this manner those act who are without conscience and without love towards others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3449 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3449. Praeterea etiam insontes supponere cupiit, sic ut cum inculparetur, substitueret insontes, quoscunque putabat insontes, [persuadendo] quod tales quoque essent, sic ut se non solum exculparet, sed etiam persuaderet aliis, quod licitum, ita substituit quemcunque offendit; quod ii faciunt qui absque conscientia sunt, et quibus nullus amor erga alios. </p>
