<p>208.灵人特别憎恶的东西：如锋利尖锐的东西和某些动物。有些东西是灵人特别憎恶的，如当像锋利、尖锐的东西进入我的想象时，灵人可以说立刻被激起来，开始造成骚乱。我推断这是由于以下事实：这类事物无法通过代表被传给天使；因为尘世的形像相对尖锐，而天堂的形式都是从圆形开始的。由于同样的原因，还有一些动物也是他们极其憎恶的，我推断（我对此不十分确定）它们是摩西五经中所禁止、被视为亵渎的那类动物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 208</h4><p>208. Things that spirits most especially shrink from, such as sharp articles, and certain kinds of animals<p>There are some things which spirits most especially shrink from, as when anything like sharp, pointed articles were imaged in my mind, immediately then, as if aroused, they would start to make trouble. I believe this was due to the fact that things of this nature cannot be conveyed and portrayed to the angels; for earthly figures are those that are comparatively sharp, while heavenly forms begin from what is circular.<p>There are certain kinds of animals also which they very much abhor for the same reason, such as those, I suppose - I am still not sure about this - which are forbidden in the books of Moses and considered as profane. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 208</h4><p>208. THINGS THAT SPIRITS ESPECIALLY ABHOR: AS SHARP THINGS, AND CERTAIN SPECIES OF ANIMALS <p>There are things that spirits especially abhor; as when things that were sharp, pointed and the like entered into my imagination, they were, as it were, immediately excited and stirred up disturbances. I suppose the reason is that such things cannot be conveyed to the angels by means of representations, for earthly figures are more pointed, whereas heavenly forms begin from the circular. There are also certain species of animals which they especially abhor for a similar reason, like those - as I suppose, though I am not as yet certain of it - which are forbidden in the Books of Moses and are regarded as profane. </p>
