<p>274.关于那些过着虔诚的生活，只承认一位神，却不知弥赛亚神是掌管宇宙的神之人的居所。蒙弥赛神的怜悯，今天早晨，在完全清醒的状态下，我被引领经过许多居所，还被下放到那些不知道弥赛亚神是宇宙之神，但仍过着虔诚生活的人当中。他们中间的确有平静；其它的事，我没有被恩准想起来。但他们也被提升到一个更高的居所，在那里接受教导，由此被恩赐感受内心的喜悦；尽管这一观念仍粘附在他们身上，即：他们来到了一个美丽的城市，进入美丽的居所等等。（1747年11月29日）</p>

<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 274</h4><p>274. About the habitation of those who live devoutly, but only acknowledge the one God, not knowing that God the Messiah is God over the Universe<p>This morning in full wakefulness, while I was being brought by the mercy of God the Messiah through many habitations, I was also led down among those who had not known that God the Messiah was the God of the Universe, but had still led a devout life. Among them it was really calm; the rest I am not given to remember.<p>But these also were raised up to a higher habitation, where they were taught, and thus given to feel inward joy, although the notion persisted with them that they had come into a beautiful city, and into beautiful dwellings, besides other places. 1747, the 29th day of November. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 274</h4><p>274. CONCERNING THE HABITATION OF THOSE WHO LIVE PIOUSLY, BUT WHO ONLY ACKNOWLEDGE ONE GOD, AND DO NOT KNOW THAT GOD MESSIAH IS THE GOD OVER THE UNIVERSE <p>When by the mercy of God Messiah I was conveyed this morning, in full wakefulness, through many habitations, I was also conducted among those who did not know that God Messiah is the God of the Universe, but still had led a pious life. It was indeed tranquil with them: the other things it is not granted me to remember. But they were also raised up into a higher habitation where they were taught, and thus it was given them to partake of an interior joy; but the notion still clung to them that they had come into a beautiful city, and into beautiful dwelling places: besides many other things. 1747, Nov. 29. </p>

De mansione eorum, qui pie vivunt sed modo agnoscunt Deum unum, nec sciunt quod Deus Messias sit Deus super Universum<p>Quum per plures mansiones ex misericordia Dei Messiae hoc mane in vigilia plena transferrer, etiam deductus sum apud eos, qui ignorarunt, quod Deus Messias esset Deus Universi, sed usque piam egerunt vitam, apud eos quidem tranquillum erat, caeterorum non meminisse mihi datur, sed ii quoque elevati sunt in superiorem mansionem ubi edocti sunt, et sic dabatur iis frui gaudio interiori, sed adhaerebat id, quod autumarent se venisse in pulchram civitatem, et in pulchra domicilia, praeter plura. 1747, die 29 Nov. </p>
