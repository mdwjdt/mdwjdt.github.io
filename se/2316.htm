<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2316</h4><p>2316. This shows that societies of spirits are interlinked in a series, so that one relates to the other, arranged in a chain according to a most strict order, and that the spirit who spoke with me is a medium looking this way, to whom very many others related who knew hardly anything about me. So the order of the universe, all the series of order, the horizontal and vertical orderings of societies in the world of spirits, and in the heavens, are incomprehensible. There are in the heavens as it were unbroken series of centers, and a mutual regard between all, not comparable to the relationship of circumferences to centers, but like that of nothing but centers between themselves, which, being kept in order together, cause the coordination of all things even to the very least. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2316</h4><p>2316. Hence it must be evident that the societies of spirits form a concatenated series, so that one is related [is referred] to another in a series arranged in a most orderly manner, and that he who spoke to me was a sort of subject looking hitherward, to which very many others are referred [related] who scarcely knew anything about me. Therefore the order of things, the series of order [and], of co-ordination, and the subordinations of the societies in the world of spirits and in the heavens are incomprehensible. There are in the heavens, as it were, perpetual centers, and a mutual relation [respectus] of all, not comparable to the relation of circumferences to centers, but, as it were, of continual centers amongst each other, from whose co-ordination each and all things are coordinated. - 1748, June 12. </p>
