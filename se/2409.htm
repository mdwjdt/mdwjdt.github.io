<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2409</h4><p>2409. The foul things of humans are only concealed, so as not to appear<p>It is obvious from very many considerations that there is in a human being nothing but what is filthy and foul, in the very least particulars as in most general respects, and that these filthy and foul qualities are concealed, so that from the Lord, they can appear as good spirits and angels.<p>Just now I am being allowed to realize this from something that happened physically, namely that some unpleasant tastes were taken away from me, when yet I knew very well that these things had a bad taste-in fact, a good flavor was introduced; also from the fact that pleasant odors are introduced, and like phenomena, which were demonstrated physically only as symbolic confirmations. 1748, 26 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2409</h4><p>2409. THAT THE FOUL [foeda] THINGS OF A MAN ARE ONLY HIDDEN SO AS NOT TO APPEAR. <p>From very many things, it may be manifest that in man is nothing but what is filth and foul, in the most singular things as well as in the most general; and that those filthy and foul things are hidden, consequently, by the Lord, in order that they may appear as good spirits and angels. This I was permitted to become acquainted with just now, from what befell me in externals, to wit, noisome tastes [gustus tetri] were taken away from me, when yet therein was an evil taste, as I knew; yea, a good taste [sapor] introduced; as also from these things, that pleasant odours are introduced [inducantur] and the like, which are shown in externals only, as tokens of proof. - 1748, June 26. </p>

Quod <sup>1</sup></p><p>foeda hominis modo occultentur, ne appareant<p>A permultis id constare potest, quod in homine nihil nisi spurcum et foedum, in singularissimis sicut in communissimo, et quod spurca et foeda ea occultentur, et sic a Domino, apparere possint sicut boni spiritus, et angeli, quod solum nunc licet ex iis quae <sup>2</sup></p><p>in externis contigerunt, quoque sciri, nempe quod gustus tetri mihi ademti sint, cum tamen iis inesset malus gustus, quod notum mihi, imo inductus sapor bonus: sicut quoque ex iis, quod odores jucundi inducantur, et similia, quae in externis ostensa sunt, solum ut confirmationis symbola. 1748, 26 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;This is how it appears in J.F.I.
