<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4079</h4><p>4079. About inflow<p>It has been observed very frequently that whatever evil spirits poured in was as if their own, for they flow in from what is their own, and the idea of it being their own is always present, for they want to control the person, nor do they allow that the person is something. But whatever came from heaven was seen and felt almost as if it were my own. For [the angels] want there to be such communication with people on earth that they scarcely know otherwise but that it is theirs. So free are they in this case, while in the case of evil spirits they are slaves. This quality heaven has from the Lord, of appropriating to man what is His - only a sense is imparted that it is the Lord's, but so slight as to be hardly noticed. 1748, 26 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4079</h4><p>4079. CONCERNING INFLUX.<p>It was very frequently observed, whatever was infused by evil spirits, it was of their proprium, for they flow in from the proprium, and a proprial idea is always in it, for they wish to rule man and not to suffer him to be anything. But whatever is from heaven, this was seen and perceived to be almost as if it were my own, because they wish that there should be such a communication with man that he can scarcely know otherwise the it is his; so free is he in this case, while in the other he is the slave of [evil] spirits. Heaven has this from the Lord, that what is His should be appropriated to man; only a perception is insinuated that it is the Lord, but so slight as to be scarcely observable. - 1748, November 26. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4079 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4079. <sup>1</sup></p><p>De influxu<p>Observatum saepissime, quod quicquid infunderent spiritus mali, [esset] ut proprium eorum, nam ex proprio influunt, et proprii idea semper inest, nam regere hominem volunt, nec sufferunt ut homo sit aliquid: at quicquid a coelo, quod hoc visum et perceptum fere ac esset meum, quia volunt, ut talis sit communicatio cum homine, ut vix sciat aliter quam quod sit ejus, ita liberum, cum spirituum sit servum: hoc coelum a Domino habet, ut adproprientur homini quae Ipsius; solum perceptio quod sit Domini, insinuata, sed talis, ut vix appercipitur. 1748, 26 Nov.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;vide annotationem ad <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4079/swedenborg_experientiae-spirituales_4071" target=_top>4071</a> fin. </p>
