<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2293</h4><p>2293. Souls, spirits and angels learn truths, both in a pleasant and in a sad state; but what the difference is<p>Spirits complained exceedingly when they had heard certain truths, such as that they are nothing, that they are only vessels, and instruments of life, that from their own power they can do nothing good, and the like. These truths considerably aggravated and offended the spirits, especially those stirred with self-love, whereas others learn truths in a pleasant state. So they complained, why should they learn in a state of mind so hard and depressed? For those truths very much aggravated them. Then the thought arose among angels and spirits, why are they taught in a depressed state?<p>The answer was given them that the state of mind they are in when they learn has a way of returning or being recalled together with those same truths, so that when a similar truth returns or is recalled to mind, especially when it has become familiar, and more or less one's own, then that sadness also returns, which is made cheerful by the Lord and becomes pleasantness. In this way the sensation of it is enhanced, as is everything in relation to its diversities, even its opposites. This is evident from many things in nature, from taste, odor, every object of sight, from a thousand other things, from harmonies in music, [etc.] 1748, 11 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2293</h4><p>2293. THAT SOUL, SPIRITS, AND ANGELS LEARN TRUTHS, AS MUCH IN A PLEASANT AS A SORROWFUL STATE, BUT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. <p>Spirits greatly complained when they heard certain truths, as that they were nothing, that they were only vessels and organs of life, that they can do nothing of themselves, and the like; which were very distasteful and offensive to spirits, especially to those who were stirred with self-love. But others learn truths in a pleasant state. Wherefore they complained that they should learn in so hard and grievous a state, for these truths were exceedingly distasteful to them. Then came the thought to angels and spirits why they are taught in a grievous state; but the reply was made them that the state in which they are when they learn has this property, that it returns or is recalled with the truths. Wherefore when a similar truth returns or is recalled, especially when it becomes familiar, and is, as it were, appropriated, then that sadness also returns which is gladdened by the Lord and becomes pleasant; thus its sense is exalted. In like manner everything has relation to its dissimilars, yea, its opposites, as may be apparent from many things in nature; from taste, order, every object of sight, from a thousand other things, from the harmonies of music. - 1748, June 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2293 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2293. Quod animae, spiritus et angeli discant veritates, tam in statu jucundo, quam tristi, sed quae differentia<p>Maximopere conquesti sunt spiritus, cum veritates quasdam audiverunt, sicut quod nihili sint, quod solum vasa, et organa vitae, quod ex se agere nihil bonum queant; et similia, quae admodum aggravaverunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>et offenderunt spiritus, cumprimis qui sui amore essent perciti; at vero alii discunt veritates in statu jucundo, quare conquesti, quid in statu tam duro, et gravi discerent? nam valde aggravabant istae veritates, tunc venit cogitatio inter angelos, et spiritus, cur in statu gravi doceantur; sed iis responsum, quod status in quo sunt, cum discunt, id secum habeat, quod cum ipsis veritatibus redeat seu revocetur, quare cum redit similis veritas, aut revocatur, cumprimis quando familiaris fit, et quasi adpropriatur <sup>2</sup></p><p>, tunc triste id quoque redit, quod a Domino laetificatur, et jucundum fit, ita sensus ejus exaltatur, sicut omne relative a suis diversis, imo oppositis, ut ex multis in natura constare potest, ex sapore, odore, objecto omni visus, ex mille aliis, ex harmonicis in musica. 1748, 11 Junius.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The Manuscript has aggraverunt<p>2.&nbsp;The Manuscript has adproprriatur </p>
