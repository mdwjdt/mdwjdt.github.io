<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4707</h4><p>4707. About a home of the intelligent, and about the horses and carriages there<p>A certain one desired to see the homes of those who are intelligent because he had heard that horses and carriages were seen there. It was (Rhydelius). And he went there and at first saw nothing else in the whole area than carriages with horses. Then when his eyes were opened, he saw people there walking. He said that before this they had appeared to him to be carriages with horses. They said that it sometimes appears like this to them too and that the carriages with horses are teachings about charity that they are thinking and talking about among themselves. But that the teachings are about charity [is] because the people came from the ancient Churches at the time when these teachings were current. When he was thinking this over, they saw him as a horse running quickly and returning, even though he was standing quietly. These wise men there said that they saw that his thought was from [a belief in] faith alone, for it was a small, swift horse and there was no carriage. They saw also, from his clothing, what office he had held. After this, when he went out, he went into a room where there was a tree with fruits. He cut off a branch there and took it with him. It was a little bunch of grapes. From this they knew that there was also something good within him, because a white grape is the affection for truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4707</h4><p>4707. CONCERNING THE DWELLING OF THE INTELLIGENT, AND CONCERNING THE HORSES AND CHARIOTS THERE.<p>A certain one desired to see the dwellings of the intelligent, because he heard that horses and chariots appear there. It was (Rhydelius). He also came thither, and, at first, saw nothing else, in the whole region, but chariots with horses; and, when his eyes were opened, he saw men there, walking. He said that, previously, there appeared to him chariots with horses. They said that so also it appears to them, sometimes; and that the chariots with horses are the doctrinals of charity, concerning which they think and speak together; but that the reason they are the doctrinals of charity, was because they [i. e., the speakers] belonged to the ancient churches when those doctrinals prevailed. When he meditated on this, they saw him as a horse running swiftly and returning, although he stood quietly. The wise ones there told him that they saw that he was in faith alone; for he was a small fleet horse, and not a chariot. They also saw, from his dress, what his function was. Afterwards, when he departed, he entered a chamber where was a tree with fruits; he plucked a branch thereof, which he carried with him. It was a small bunch of grapes. Hence, they knew that there was also something of good in him, because a sound grape is the affection of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4707 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4707. De domicilio intelligentium, ac de equis et curribus ibi<p>Quidam desideravit videre domicilia intelligentium, quia audivit quod ibi appareant equi et currus, erat Rhydelius), venit etiam illuc, et vidit primo nihil aliud in toto tractu quam currus cum equis, et cum aperiebantur oculi, videbat homines ibi ambulantes, dicebat quod prius apparuerint ei currus cum equis, dicebant quod sic etiam illis quandoque appareat, et quod currus cum equis sint doctrinalia charitatis, de quibus cogitant et inter se loquuntur, sed quod sint doctrinalia charitatis, quia ab antiquis Ecclesiis fuerunt, quando illa doctrinalia erant, ille cum meditaretur hoc, videbant illum sicut equum currentem celeriter, ac redeuntem, tametsi staret tranquillus, dicebant illi sapientes ibi, quod viderent quod esset ex sola fide, nam erat equus parvus velox, et non currus; videbant etiam ex veste qua functione fuerit; postea cum exiret, intrabat cameram ubi arbor cum fructibus, ibi decerpebat ramum, quem secum portabat, erat uvae racemulus, inde sciebant, quod etiam aliquid boni apud illum esset, quia uva candida est affectio veri. </p>
