<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2890</h4><p>2890. give the Lord the blame! This is in no way the meaning of the general Law, for it is permitted to resist every evil when no other help is at hand, but only with the mind of resisting the evil, not of hating the one who does it, nor with the mind of taking revenge: for then one is given by the Lord, through means suitable at the time, the power of resisting and the mind of resisting, and these kinds of resistance are controlled by the Lord.<p>When they did not understand, or did not wish to understand (not knowing what it is to resist without hatred and revenge and twist the evil back toward someone), they wanted to draw me into some arguments. In reply I said this is a truth and a general law, and if they developed arguments against it, nothing of that law and truth would be understood, but there would only be piles of reasonings, hence mental darkness. 1748, 23 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2890</h4><p>2890. and when he does not receive [it] puts the blame on the Lord; such is by no means the understanding of the general law, but it is lawful to anyone to resist evil, when there is no other help at hand, but only with the mind of resisting evil, not [with the mind] of hating him who does [it], nor with the mind of exercising vengeance; for then the Lord, by means suitable at that time, gives him the strength and mind to resist; which resistance is regulated by the Lord. When they did not understand, or wish to understand this; for they could not understand what it is to resist, and retort evil on anyone, without hatred and vengeance, they wished to draw me into some arguments; to whom it was said, that this is the truth, and a general law, against which, if arguments should be formed, nothing would be understood concerning the law and that truth; but there would only be accumulations or arguments, hence, darkness of mind. - 1748, August 23. </p>
