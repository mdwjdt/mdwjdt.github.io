<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3035</h4><p>3035. I also realized, as was shown to them, that an idea of societies in the world of spirits can be obtained from the partnerships of muscles in the human being and their communications through the tissues and countless other connections, in that they flow according to their relationship into each most simple action; and that the breathing of the lung is therefore changed accordingly, because it is the lung that operates into the muscular system in general, as is known from the things written about the lung. <sup>1</sup>1748, 2 Sept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Animate Kingdom 337. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3035</h4><p>3035. I perceived also that they were shown that the [an] idea of the societies in the world of spirits can be obtained from the consociation of the muscles in man, and that the communications of these, by means of fibers, and indefinite other nexus, inflow according to affinities into every simplest action; and that the respiration of the lungs is therefore changed into such, because it is the lungs which operates in general into the muscular system, as is known from those things which [are] written, concerning the lungs. - 1748, September 2. </p>
