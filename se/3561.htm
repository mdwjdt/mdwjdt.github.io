<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 3561</h4><p>3561. About little children<p>I noticed several times when little children had been sent to me and appeared as if scattered around my head [<a href="3542.htm">3542</a>], that they were not at all afraid of the attacks of devils, nor were they at all worried, because they were unconscious of such spirits. Therefore, when one who has faith is being protected from the attacks of devils, little children are even sent, who then protect the person - which I have also been told several times, and given to realize. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 3561</h4><p>3561. CONCERNING INFANTS.<p>It was shown, when infants were sometimes sent to me, and they appeared as if dispersed about the head, that they had no fear of diabolical infestations, nor were at all concerned, because they had no perception of such things; wherefore, while anyone is in faith, he is rendered safe from such infestations, and infants also are sent to guard him. This was often said to me, and it was given to perceive it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 3561 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>3561. De infantibus<p>Observatum cum infantes aliquoties fuerunt ad me missi, et apparerent sicut sparsi circum caput, quod nihil usquam timerent infestationes diabolicas, nec quicquam curarent, quia sunt talium imperceptibiles, quare dum qui in fide tutus reddatur ab infestationibus diabolicis, mittuntur quoque infantes, qui sic tutantur; quod etiam aliquoties mihi dictum, et percipere datum. </p>
