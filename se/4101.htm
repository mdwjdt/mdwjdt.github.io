<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4101</h4><p>4101. About the most deceitful spirits<p>It is astounding that the most deceitful spirits overhead, who had been pontiffs and such, cannot refrain, the moment that something guiltless and innocent appears, to seize upon it as something by which they can ensnare. When something blameless occurred, as when I counted my footsteps on the street, they took hold of a wicked medium by whom they could set a trap to try to cut the throat with knives of any passerby. But such spirits are fearful for themselves, for as often as they did this they have been punished. They spoke among themselves, as they had done in their lifetime, saying that because I was opposed to the pope, I should be brought before the inquisition. 1748, 29 Nov. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4101</h4><p>4101. CONCERNING THE MOST DECEITFUL.<p>It is astonishing that the most deceitful above the head, who had been pontiffs and the like, cannot refrain, as soon as anything guileless and innocent appears, from laying hold of something as a means or occasion of ensnaring. When anything of this kind occurred, as, for instance, when I counted footsteps in the street; they immediately seized a wicked subject by which to carry on their machinations, and it was perceived that they would fain murder whatever innocent person came in their way. But they were still of such a quality as to be in fear for themselves, for as often as they did this they were published. They spoke among themselves, as in the state of their worldly life, that because I was against the Pope, I should be borne to the inquisition. - 1748, November 29. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4101 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4101. De dolosissimis<p>Stupendum est quod dolosissimi supra caput, qui pontifices et tales fuerunt, non desistere possint, utprimum aliquid insons et innocens apparet, id arripere per quod insidientur, cum aliquod insons erat, ut in platea cum numeravi gressus, arripiebant nefandum subjectum ut insidiarentur, quod cultris quemcunque innocentem jugulare vellent, sed tales sunt ut sui timeant, nam toties puniti sunt; loquuti inter se, sicut in statu vitae, quod quia contra pontificem, quod ad inquisitionem ferrer. 1748, 29 Nov. </p>
