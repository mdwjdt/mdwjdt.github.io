<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2944</h4><p>2944. To one who has faith in the Lord evil is not accounted,<p>nor is the good that person does ascribed to him or her<p>About these points I have spoken with spirits, and by a varied experience it has also been confirmed previously [<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2102.htm">2102</a>], now again by one more, and demonstrated before my eyes that this is the case. For some were saying they wanted to reduce me to being nothing, so they received the reply that [one who has faith] confesses to being nothing. And so we spoke somewhat about this "being nothing," as often done previously [<a href="1912.htm">1912</a>, <a href="2043.htm">2043</a> ff., <a href="2418.htm">2418</a>, <a href="2464.htm">2464-2467</a>, <a href="2470.htm">2470-2471</a>], and it was shown by demonstration that when an evil is committed, such a person is then not in the evil along with them, being aroused by them to doing the evil, and indeed in such a way, as has sometimes happened, that they compelled me, as they have others, to speaking, feeling, and doing the evil for the purpose of laying the blame for their own evil on the person, which has often happened. So when spirits are able to compel someone to thinking, speaking or doing evilly, then they not only  </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2944</h4><p>2944. THAT EVIL IS NOT IMPUTED TO HIM WHO IS IN FAITH IN THE LORD, NOR THE GOOD ATTRIBUTED TO HIM WHICH HE DOES. <p>I spoke concerning these things with spirits, and it was also confirmed by previous various experience, and now by [this] one, and demonstrated before the eyes that the matter is so. For certain said, that they wished to reduce me to be nothing. Wherefore it was replied to them, that they themselves acknowledge that there is a nothing: Wherefore I have spoken somewhat concerning this the being nothing, and often previously: and it was shown to demonstration, that when evil is done [by anyone] he is not then in evil along with them, because [he has been] excited by them to commit evil, yea to such extent, as sometimes occurred, that they have compelled me like [as also] others, to speak, feel, and do it for the purpose of criminating him, out of his own [art]. This often happened. Therefore, when spirits can compel anyone to think, say or do evil, then do they not only attribute evil to him. </p>
