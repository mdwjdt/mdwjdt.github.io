<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 1443</h4><p>1443. Further, I saw very many spirits of the inhabitants of Mercury, who constitute only inner sensation, all together as if in one mass, stretching out as if in long rows. But because many of them did not want to stretch out in this direction, thus toward this earth, they bent themselves back like a huge army, gyrating toward the right side, then turning around and approaching the planet Venus.<p>As they were nearing it, they said that they did not want to be there, because they knew them to be very wicked. But being informed, I was able to realize that they were calling them very wicked because [the spirits of Venus] call themselves nothing, and wild animals, and those from the planet Mercury detested this.<p>They therefore betook themselves to the other side of the planet Venus, saying that here the good ones are. From there as end point of their course, they curved around to the right and the left, more or less surrounding that whole planet, that is, the spirits of that planet. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 1443</h4><p>1443. Moreover, I have seen very many spirits from the inhabitants of Mercury, who constitute only the internal sense, as if in one group, and they extended themselves, as it were, into long rows. But because many of them were unwilling to extend themselves in this direction, that is, towards this earth, they therefore turned themselves back like a great army, and then revolving themselves into gyres towards the right, they approached the planet Venus. When they arrived there they said they were unwilling to remain, because they know that they were very wicked. But being instructed, it was granted me to know that the spirits of Mercury called them very wicked because they said that they were nothing, that they were beasts, to which those from the planet Mercury were averse. And so they betook themselves to the other side of the planet Venus, saying that here they are good; thence as from a terminus they curved round to the right and left, and, as it were, encompassed that whole planet, that is, the spirits of that planet. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 1443 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>1443. Vidi porro, quod spiritus incolarum Mercurii, qui modo constituunt sensum internum, perplures in uno quasi globo [essent], qui se extendebant quasi in series longas, sed quia plures eorum nollent, ut se extenderent huc, seu ad hunc tellurem, ideo se reflectebant, sicut magnus exercitus, in gyros dextrorsum, et dein se revolvebant, et approximabant ad tellurem Veneris, ad quam cum venirent, dicebant quod ibi esse nollent, quia scirent quod pessimi essent, sed instructus, nosse mihi dabatur, quod pessimos eos ideo vocarent, quia dicunt se esse nihil, esse bestias, quod aversabantur ii quu ex Mercurii tellure, quare conferebant se ad alteram partem telluris Veneris, dicentes, quod hic sint boni; inde quasi a termino, per dextrum et sinistrum se circumflectebant, et circumdabant quasi totam istam tellurem, seu spiritus istius telluris. </p>
