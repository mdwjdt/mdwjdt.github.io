<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2286</h4><p>2286. Neither do the angels have that kind of memory, that is, a memory of physical and merely material mental imagery - which is not at all compatible with their character. Such things are far beneath or outside of them, so that obviously the words and names in the Word of the Lord do not mean [to them] the personal specifics with which the literal level of meaning deals, but inward things that are angelic, consequently spiritual and heavenly things, thus Divine ones. So if by Moses, Aaron, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob someone [reading] understands persons, [the names] would hardly be understood by a single angel. For when such names enter into heaven, they pass into complete oblivion with the angels, for they take on spiritual and heavenly, thus universal imagery, symbolizing higher realities. 1748, 10 June. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2286</h4><p>2286. As the memory of corporeal and merely material ideas, which never agree [congruent] with their disposition, such things are far beneath or without them (from which it must be plain enough that by words and names, in the Word of the Lord, are not understood particulars by which the sense of the letter [is bounded], but interiors which are angelic, consequently spiritual and celestial things, therefore Divine things. Wherefore if anyone understands persons by Moses, Aaron, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, least would he be understood by one of the angels; for when angels enter heaven, entire oblivion of such things occurs with them, for they are endued with spiritual and celestial ideas, thus with universal [ideas] and significant things. - 1748, June 10.) </p>
