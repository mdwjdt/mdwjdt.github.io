<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2793</h4><p>2793. What punishments also accomplish in the other life<p>There are numerous punishments, heavier and more prolonged according to the nature of each one's character acquired during bodily life. But punishments have the effect over a period of time of instilling them with fears, shames, horrors, for the things that their nature has fed upon and drunk in. So when they are associated with those who are better and those things come up that agree with their nature, they are warned by those fears, shames, and horrors that they have been struck with and are thereby apt to be led away from them.<p>But still, they do not alter or change their nature, which remains as developed in the life of the body to eternity, but the punishments add on the means whereby they can be led away from their evils. 1748, 11 Aug. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2793</h4><p>2793. WHAT IS EFFECTED ALSO BY PUNISHMENTS IN THE OTHER LIFE. <p>There are many punishments more grievous and prolonged according to the nature of each one's disposition contracted in the life of the body: but punishments effect this [id], that for [some] interval of time they inspire fears, shames, horrors, for such things as their nature is satiated and imbued with. Wherefore when they are inserted amongst the better [spirits] then when the like things occur which belong to their nature, they are admonished by means of the inspired fears, shames and horrors, [and] thus are wont to be withdrawn thence. But still they do not alter or change the nature which remains as contracted in the life of the body to eternity, but punishments are superadded whereby they can be withdrawn from such evils. - 1748, August 11. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2793 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2793. Quid etiam poenae efficiant in altera vita<p>Sunt multiplices poenae, graviores et diuturniores secundum cujusvis tractam naturam indolis in vita corporis, sed poenae id efficiunt, ut per tractum temporis incutiant timores, pudores, horrores, pro talibus quibus inescata et imbuta est natura eorum, quare dum inter meliores inseruntur, tunc quando similia occurrunt, quae naturae eorum sunt, admonentur per incussos timores, pudores et horrores, sic inde abduci solent: sed usque non alterant seu mutant naturam, quae remanet ut tracta est in vita corporis, in aeternum, sed poenae superaddunt ea, quibus abduci possint a talibus malis. 1748, 11 Aug. </p>
