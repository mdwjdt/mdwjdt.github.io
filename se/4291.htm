<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 4291</h4><p>4291. When asked whether he had ever thought about the other life, he said that he had not believed, and had rejected all those propositions, for the reason that he had seen so many contradictions - a righteous man suffering, an impious man exalted, and the like - also, that wild animals have life, and therefore that he would surely die together with the body: and that he is entirely dumbfounded to realize that he is now living. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 4291</h4><p>4291. When asked whether he had ever thought of another life, he said that he had never believed in it, but had rejected everything of the kind, and that for the reason that he had seen so much to confound that idea as the just man suffering and the wicked exulting, and other things of that nature, especially as he saw that the evil led a happy life; from all which he concluded that he should die altogether in the death of the body. He confessed that he was in the greatest astonishment to find himself now alive. </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 4291 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>4291. Interrogabatur num usquam cogitaverit de altera vita, dicebat, quod non crediderit, et quod rejecerit omnia illa, ex eo quod viderit multa ita confusa, justum pati, impium gloriari, et talia, tum quod bruta quoque vitam habeant, et sic quod moriturus prorsus cum corpore; et quod maximo in stupore sit, quod percipiat se nunc vivere. </p>
