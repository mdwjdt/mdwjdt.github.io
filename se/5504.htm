For the most part these were as the kind that is affected by truth, and now provision was made for them to enjoy their joy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 5504</h4><p>5504. After this, a great number were sent to all these from the middle - namely, of those who are called Reformed and Protestants, who are in the knowledges of the Church - to the end that they might instruct them, and so prepare them for heaven; for they were, for the most part, in the affection of truth; and it was now provided that they should receive their joys. </p>

Postea ex medio magnus numerus ad omnes illos missi sunt, nempe ex iis qui reformati et protestantes vocantur, qui in cognitionibus Ecclesiae, propter finem, ut erudirent illos, et sic praepararent ad coelum, nam plerique illi in affectione veri erant, et nunc provisum ut sua gaudia acciperent. </p>
