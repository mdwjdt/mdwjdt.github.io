<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Odhner and Nemitz translation 1998) 2677</h4><p>2677. Those, however, who have been confirmed in the truths of faith, that is, who are led by the Lord, appear as bright little stars in the [celestial] hemisphere. They have appeared to me at times as such, and so they appeared today to spirits. Just from that appearance we could tell where they were and what they were like. They also spoke with me. 1748, 25 July. </p>
<h4 align="center">Spiritual Experiences (Buss translation 1902) 2677</h4><p>2677. But those who are in the truths of faith, that is, who are led by the Lord, appear like bright little stars in the hemisphere: Such sometimes have they appeared to me, and this day have appeared in such wise to spirits: they only distinguished from such an appearance where they were, and of what quality they were. They also spoke with me. - 1748, July 25.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Experientiae Spirituales 2677 (original Latin 1748-1764)</h4><p>2677. Qui autem in veritatibus fidei sunt, hoc est, qui a Domino ducuntur, apparent sicut stellulae lucidae in haemisphaerio; tales mihi quandoque apparuerunt, et taliter apparuerunt hodie spiritibus, solum ex apparentia tali dignoscentes ubi essent, et quales essent; qui quoque mecum loquebantur. 1748, 25 Julius. </p>
