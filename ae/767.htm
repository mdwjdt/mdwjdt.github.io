<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 767</h4><p>767.And the dragon was wroth against the woman.- That this signifies the hatred of those who are meant by the dragon, against the church, which is the New Jerusalem, enkindled by the perception that it is favoured by many, is evident from the signification of wroth when said of the dragon, as denoting hatred, concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/754.htm">754</a>, <a href="../ae/758.htm">758</a>), therefore to be wroth denotes to hate. That it is a grievous hatred enkindled by the perception that that church is favoured by many, follows as a consequence from what precedes and from what follows. From what precedes, namely, that the earth opened her mouth, and helped the woman, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth, which signifies that the church, in which there are also dragons, rendered assistance, and did not accept their crafty reasonings about faith alone; and from what follows, namely, that the dragon went away to make war with the rest of her seed, which signifies a determined effort, arising from that hatred, to attack the truths of the doctrine of that church. The anger of the dragon therefore signifies here such hatred enkindled by a perception that it is favoured by many. For, as said above, the woman flying into the wilderness to the place prepared by God signifies that the church which is the New Jerusalem was yet among a few, while provision was being made for it among many, and for its growing to fullness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 767</h4><p>767. Verse 17. And the dragon was angry against the woman, signifies the hatred of those who are meant by "the dragon" against the church that is the New Jerusalem, enkindled by a perception that it is favored by many. This is evident from the signification of "anger," as being, in reference to the dragon, hatred (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/754.htm">754</a>, <a href="../ae/758.htm">758</a>), therefore "to be angry" means to hate; that this is a grievous hatred enkindled by a perception that the church is favored by many, follows as a consequence from what precedes and from what follows; from what precedes, namely, that "the earth opened her mouth and helped the woman, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth," which signifies that the church, in which there are also dragons, rendered assistance, and did not accept their keen reasonings respecting faith alone; and from what follows namely, that "the dragon went away to make war with the remnant of her seed," which signifies an ardent effort from that hatred to assault the truths of doctrine of that church. So "the anger of the dragon" here signifies such hatred enkindled by a perception that it is favored by many; for, as has been said above, "the woman fled into the wilderness into a place prepared by God" signifies that the church which is the New Jerusalem was among a few, while provision was making for it among many, and for its growing to fullness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 767 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>767. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_767/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_17" target=_top>17</a>.] "Et iratus est draco contra mulierem." - Quod significet odium illorum, qui per "draconem" intelliguntur, contra ecclesiam, quae Novae Hierosolymae, incensum a percepto favore plurium, constat ex significatione "irae", cum de dracone, quod sit odium (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_767/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_754" target=_top>754</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_767/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_758" target=_top>758</a>), inde "iratus esse", quod sit in odio esse; quod odium illud sit odium grave incensum ex percepto favore plurium, fluit ex illis quae praecedunt, et ex illis quae sequuntur; ex his quae praecedunt, quod "terra aperuerit os suum, et adjuverit mulierem, et deglutiverit flumen quod draco ex ore suo ejecit", per quae significatur quod ecclesia, in qua etiam dracones sunt, operam praestiterit, et acutas ratiocinationes illorum de sola fide non receperit; et ex his quae sequuntur, quod "draco abiverit bellum facere cum reliquis seminis ejus", per quae significatur ardens ex illo odio conatus impugnandi vera doctrinae illius ecclesiae: inde est quod per "iram draconis" hic significetur odium incensum a percepto favore plurium; nam, ut supra dictum est, per quod "mulier fugerit in desertum in locum praeparatum a Deo", significatur quod ecclesia, quae Nova Hierosolyma, esset inter paucos, usque dum providetur inter plures, et crescit in plenum. </p>
