<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 243</h4><p>243. And white garments, that thou mayest be clothed. That this signifies genuine truths and intelligence therefrom, is evident from the signification of white garments, as being genuine truths; for garments signify truths (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>), and white signifies what is genuine, and is said of truths (as may be seen also above, n. <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>); and from the signification of to clothe as being to procure for oneself intelligence therefrom, for by means of genuine truths all intelligence is obtained; for the human understanding is formed to receive truths, therefore such as are the truths of which it is formed, such is its quality. It is believed that it is a matter of the understanding to be able to reason from thought and to speak from falsities, and to confirm them by many arguments; but this is not understanding, it is only a faculty given to man with the memory to which it is adjoined, and of which it is an activity. Nevertheless, the understanding is thereby born and formed, in proportion as man receives truths from affection; but to receive genuine truths from affection is not possible for any man, except from the Lord alone, because they are from Him. Consequently, to receive understanding, or to become intelligent, is imparted to man by the Lord alone, and to every one who applies himself to receive, according to what was said above (n. <a href="../ae/239.htm">239</a>). This therefore is what is signified by, I counsel thee to buy of me white garments, that thou mayest be clothed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 243</h4><p>243. And white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, signifies genuine truths and intelligence therefrom. This is evident from the signification of "white garments," as being genuine truths, for garments signify truths (See above, n. <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>), and "white" signifies what is genuine, and is predicated of truths (See above, n. <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>); also from the signification of "to clothe," as being to acquire intelligence for oneself therefrom, for by means of genuine truths all intelligence is acquired; for the human understanding is formed to receive truths, therefore it becomes such as the truths are out of which it is formed. It is supposed that understanding is also the ability to reason from thought and to speak from falsities, and to confirm falsities by many arguments; but this is not understanding, it is only a faculty granted to man with the memory to which it is adjoined, and of which it is an activity. Yet by means of this faculty the understanding is born and formed, so far as man receives truths from affection; but genuine truths it is not possible for any man to receive from affection except only from the Lord, since they are from Him; consequently, to receive understanding, or to become intelligent, is not given to any man, except only from the Lord, but it is given to everyone who applies himself to receive (according to what was said above, n. <a href="../ae/239.htm">239</a>. This, therefore, is signified by "I counsel thee to buy of Me white garments, that thou mayest be clothed." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 243 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>243. "Et vestimenta alba ut induaris." - Quod significet et genuina vera et inde intelligentiam, constat ex significatione "vestimentorum alborum", quod sint genuina vera; ("vestimenta" enim significant vera, videatur supra, n. <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_243/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_195" target=_top>195</a>(b), et "album" significat genuinum, et praedicatur de veris, etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_243/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_196" target=_top>196</a>); et ex significatione "induere", quod sit inde intelligentiam sibi comparare, nam per genuina vera comparatur omnis intelligentia; intellectus enim humanus est formatus ad recipiendum vera; ideo talis fit qualia sunt vera ex quibus formatur. Creditur quod intellectus sit etiam posse ex cogitatione ratiocinari et loqui ex falsis, et ea multis confirmare; sed usque id non intellectus est; est modo facultas homini data cum memoria, cui adjuncta est, et cujus activum est: at per illam nascitur et formatur intellectus, quantum homo ex affectione recipit vera; at recipere genuina vera ex affectione non datur ulli homini quam a solo Domino, quoniam ab Ipso sunt; proinde recipere intellectum seu intelligens fieri non datur ulli homini quam a solo Domino, et datur cuivis qui applicat se ad recipiendum (secundum illa quae supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_243/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_239" target=_top>239</a>(a), dicta sunt): hoc itaque est quod significatur per "Suadeo tibi emere a Me vestimenta alba ut induaris."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
