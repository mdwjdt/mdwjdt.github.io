<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 483</h4><p>483. And shall lead them unto living fountains of waters.- This signifies, in Divine truths, as is evident from the signification of living fountains of waters, which denote Divine truths. By living is signified living from the Divine; by a fountain is signified the Word, and by waters are signified truths thence. Mention is frequently made of living waters in the Word, and by these are meant truths, which come from the Lord and are received. The reason why they are said to be living, is that the Lord is Life Itself, as He Himself teaches, and that which comes from Life Itself is alive; but that which comes from man is dead. The Lord, in order to give life to truths, flows into them, by means of good, and the good vivifies them. He also flows in from the higher or interior, opens the spiritual mind, and gives to it the affection for truth; and the spiritual affection for truth is the very life of heaven in man. This is the life which the Lord instils into man by means of truths. Hence it is evident what living waters and living fountains of waters mean in the following passages.</p><p>[2] Thus in Isaiah:<p>"The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst. I will open rivers on the heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness (desertum) a pool of waters, and the dry land springs of waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_17.htm">41:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_18.htm">18</a>).<p>The subject here is the salvation of the Gentiles by the Lord, and they are here called poor and needy from a want of and ignorance of truth; their desire to know truths from those who are in the church, where no truths existed, is described by their seeking water when there is none, and their tongue failing for thirst, water denoting truth, and thirst the desire thereof. That they shall be instructed by the Lord, is signified by, "I will open rivers on the heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys." To open rivers denotes to impart intelligence; on the heights denotes in the interior man; in the midst of the valleys denotes in the exterior man, and to make fountains signifies to instruct in truths. To make the wilderness a pool of waters, and the dry land springs of waters, signifies abundance of truth with those who were before in want of and in ignorance [of truth]. The wilderness denotes where there is no good because no truth, and the dry land, where there is no truth and thence no good; a pool of water and springs of water denote abundance of the knowledges of truth. From this it is evident that waters, fountains, springs, rivers, and pools of water, are not here meant, but the knowledges of truth, and thence intelligence, whence comes salvation.</p><p>[3] In the same prophet:<p>"Behold, your God will come with vengeance, and will save you. Then shall the parched place become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_4.htm">35:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_7.htm">7</a>).<p>These things also are said concerning the instruction of the Gentiles in truths, and their reformation by the Lord when He should come into the world. By the parched place becoming a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of waters, are signified things similar to those mentioned above, by which the wilderness shall become a pool or collection of waters, and the dry land springs of waters.</p><p>[4] In Jeremiah:<p>"They shall come with weeping; and with prayers will I bring them; I will lead them to fountains of waters in a straight way, let them not stumble in it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">31:9</a>).<p>Here also the subject is the reception of the Lord by the Gentiles. That he would instruct them in genuine truths is signified by his leading them in a straight way, let them not stumble in it.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the fountains of water shall he guide them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_10.htm">49:10</a>).<p>Here also the instruction of the Gentiles by the Lord is treated of. Instruction in truths is meant by leading them by the springs of water.</p><p>[5] The signification of hungering and thirsting, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/433.htm">433:13</a>). A fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah, and shall water the river of Shittim, signifies truth out of heaven from the Lord illustrating the scientifics and knowledges which are in the natural man.</p><p>[6] In David:<p>"Thou bringest forth, O earth, at thy presence, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a lake of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalm 114:7</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_8.htm">8</a>).<p>The lake of waters, and the fountain of waters here also mean truths in abundance, by which the church is formed; for by the earth bringing forth is signified the commencement of the church, which is said to bring forth, when truths are produced there, the earth denoting the church.</p><p>[7] So again:<p>Jehovah "who sendeth forth fountains into rivers; let them run between the mountains. They give drink to the beast of the fields; the wild asses quench their thirst. By them the fowl of the heavens have their habitation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_10.htm">Psalm 104:10-12</a>).<p>To send forth springs into the rivers signifies to give intelligence by means of truths from the Word; their going between the mountains, signifies that they are from the good of love; fountains denoting truths from the Word, rivers the things which pertain to intelligence, and mountains the goods of love. The instruction of those who are in the good of the church is signified by the words they give drink to the beast of the fields; and the instruction of those in the church who desire truths is signified by the wild asses quench their thirst; that thence the understanding is perfected, is signified by the fowl having their habitation near them. The beasts of the fields, in the spiritual sense, mean the Gentiles who are in the good of life, and wild asses, natural truth. Thirst means a desire for truths; and by the bird of the heavens are meant thoughts from the understanding.</p><p>[8] That a fountain, in the highest sense, means the Lord as to Divine Truth, or Divine Truth from the Lord, consequently the Word, is evident from the following passages.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that hold no water" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_13.htm">2:13</a>).<p>Here Jehovah, that is, the Lord, calls Himself a fountain of living waters, by which is signified the Word, or Divine Truth, consequently the Lord Himself, who is the Word; for it is said, "they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that hold no water," which signifies that they had framed to themselves doctrinals from their own intelligence, in which there are no truths. Cisterns denote doctrinals, broken cisterns denote doctrinals that are not consistent. That can hold no water, signifies in which there are no truths. Such are the doctrinals that are not from the Word, that is from the Lord through the Word (for the Lord teaches by means of the Word), but they are from man's own intelligence. That they were not taught by the Lord by means of the Word, is meant by the words they have forsaken the fountain of living waters.</p><p>[9] Again,<p>"All that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters" (<a href="../ae/222.htm">222:6</a>).</p><p>[10] Again, in David:<p>"They shall be filled with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt cause them to drink of the stream of delights. For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light we see light" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_36_8.htm">36:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_36_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Fatness signifies the good of love, and the stream of delights, truth from that good; to cause them drink denotes to teach. With thee is the fountain of life, signifies that Divine Truth is with the Lord and from Him; because this is signified by the fountain of life, it is therefore added, "in thy light we see light," for the light of the Lord signifies Divine Truth.</p><p>[11] In Zechariah:<p>"In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">13:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_2.htm">2</a>).<p>Here also the subject is the coming of the Lord. That those who are in the kingdom of the Lord shall then understand the Word, or the Divine Truth contained therein, is signified by, "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem," a fountain signifying the Word, the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spiritual kingdom of the Lord with those in the heavens and on the earth who are in Divine Truths; for sin and for uncleanness, signifies the removal of evils and falsities by means of truths from the Word. Because a fountain means the Word or the Divine Truth therein, it is therefore said, "I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land." False religion is signified by idols, false doctrine by prophets, and the evils flowing from falsities of doctrine by the unclean spirit; for when man lives according to the falsities of religion and of doctrine, he becomes an unclean spirit.</p><p>[12] That Divine Truth from the Lord is meant by a fountain, the Lord Himself plainly teaches in John.<p>When He sat at Jacob's well in the land of Samaria, He said to the Samaritan woman, "Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_6.htm">4:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_14.htm">14</a>).<p>Here it is evident that the water which the Lord gives, does not mean water, but Divine Truth, for it is said from the water which the woman of Samaria came to draw, that a man thirsts again, but not so from the water which the Lord gives. That there is life in that truth, is meant by that water becoming in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. That there is life in truths when the Lord gives them, may be seen in this article above. The reason why the Lord said these things to the woman of Samaria, when He sat at the well of Jacob, was, that by the Samaritans the Lord meant the Gentiles, who would receive Divine truths from Him; and by the woman of Samaria, the church from them; and by Jacob's well He meant Divine Truth from Himself, or the Word.</p><p>[13] In Moses:<p>"Thus Israel dwelleth in safety alone at the fountain of Jacob" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>).<p>These words form the conclusion of the prophecy of Moses concerning the sons of Israel. Because in that prophecy Israel signifies the church which is in Divine truths from the Word, therefore it is said at the fountain of Jacob, which means the Word, and thus also the Lord as to the Word; for He is the Word, because He is the Divine Truth, as He teaches in John (chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1-3</a>). These things are said at the end of that prophecy, because in it the Word is treated of. The same is meant by that fountain in the prophecy of the patriarch Israel concerning Joseph:<p>"The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one near a fountain" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>).<p>A fountain here means the fountain of Jacob, for the field in which that fountain was situated, was given to Joseph by his father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_5.htm">John 4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_6.htm">6</a>). What is signified by Joseph being the son of a fruitful one near a fountain, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>).<p>In the Apocalypse:<p>"I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Therefore with joy shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">12:3</a>).<p>In David:<p>"All my fountains are in thee," O Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_87_7.htm">87:7</a>).</p><p>[14] Since most things in the Word have an opposite sense, and so also have the words fountain and fountains, in which sense they signify the doctrine of falsities, and the falsities of doctrine, as in Jeremiah:<p>"I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">51:36</a>).<p>This is spoken of Babylon; and by her sea are signified her falsities in their entirety, and by her fountain the doctrine of falsity.</p><p>[15] So in Hosea:<p>"An east wind shall come, the wind of Jehovah shall come up from the wilderness, and his fountain shall become dry, and his spring shall be dried up" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_15.htm">13:15</a>).<p>This is spoken of Ephraim, who there signifies the perverted understanding of the Word, by which falsities are confirmed by means of the Word; the destruction thereof is signified by his fountain becoming dry, and his spring being dried up by the east wind, the wind of Jehovah from the wilderness. A fountain denotes the doctrine of falsity, a spring, the false thereof, and the east wind from the desert the destruction of it from fallacies which are from sensual externals. For sensual external things, when they are not illustrated from things internal, destroy the understanding of man, because all fallacies are thence derived.</p><p>[16] Again, in David:<p>"Thou didst break up the sea by thy strength; thou brakest the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people of Tziim. Thou didst break through the fountains and the river; thou driedst up mighty rivers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_13.htm">Psalm 74:13-15</a>).<p>Here also, by fountains and rivers are signified the falsities of doctrine from man's own intelligence; the mighty rivers are confirmed principles of falsity thence. The sea monsters and leviathan signify the scientifics which pertain to the sensual and natural man, from which all falsity springs when the spiritual man above them is closed. Man's proprium resides in the sensual and natural man, therefore conclusions formed from these alone are formed from the proprium, or from man's own intelligence; for the Divine flows in through the spiritual man into the natural, but not into the natural when the spiritual above it is closed, whereas the spiritual man is opened by means of truths, and by a life according to them. The people Tziim to whom leviathan is said to be given for meat, signify those who are in infernal falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 483</h4><p>483. And shall guide them unto living fountains of waters, signifies in Divine truths. This is evident from the signification of "living fountains of waters," as being Divine truths, "living" signifying living from the Divine, "fountain" the Word, and "waters" truths therefrom. "Living waters" are often mentioned in the Word, and by them are meant truths that come from the Lord and are received. These are living, because the Lord is Life itself, as He Himself teaches, and that which comes from Life itself is living; while that which comes from man is dead. That the Lord may give life to truths, He flows into them through good, and good makes alive. The Lord also flows in out of the higher or interior parts, and opens the spiritual mind, and imparts to it the affection of truth; and the spiritual affection of truth is the very life of heaven with man. This life is what the Lord insinuates into man by means of truths. This makes clear what is meant here by "living fountains of waters," and by "living waters" in the following passages.</p><p>[2] In Isaiah:<p>When the poor and needy seek water and there is none, their tongue faileth for thirst. I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains will I place in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into springs of waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_18.htm">18</a>).<p>This treats of the saving of the nations by the Lord, who are called "poor and needy" from the lack and ignorance of truth; their desire to learn truths from those who are in the church, where there were no truths, is described by "they seek waters and there are none, and their tongue faileth for thirst," "water," meaning truth, and "thirst" the desire for truth. That the Lord will instruct them is signified by "I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains will I place in the midst of the valleys;" "to open rivers" meaning to give intelligence, "on the bare heights" meaning in the interior man, "in the midst of the valleys" in the exterior man, and "to place fountains" to instruct in truths; "to make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into springs of waters" signifies abundance of truth with those who before were in the lack and ignorance thereof, "wilderness" meaning where there is no good because there is no truth, and "dry land" where there is no truth and thence no good; a "pool of waters" and "fountains of waters" signify abundance of the knowledges of truth. This makes clear that "waters," "fountains," "springs," "rivers," and "pools of water," are not here meant, but the knowledges of truth and intelligence therefrom, whence comes salvation.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>Behold your God will come for vengeance, and will save you. Then the dry place shall become a pool, and the thirsty place springs of water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_7.htm">7</a>).<p>This, too, is said of the instruction of the nations in truths, and their reformation by the Lord when He should come into the world; and "the dry place shall became a pool, and the thirsty place springs of waters," has a similar signification as "the wilderness shall become a pool (or collection) of waters, and the dry land springs of waters," in the passage above.</p><p>[4] In Jeremiah:<p>They shall come with weeping and with supplication will I lead them; I will make them go unto the brooks <sup>1</sup>of waters in the way of right, they shall not stumble in it (<a href="../ae/480.htm">480</a>; also what "heat" and "sun" signify, n. <a href="../ae/481.htm">481</a>)</p><p>[5] In Joel:<p>It shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down must, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah and shall water the brook of Shittim (<a href="../ae/433.htm">433</a>; and that "a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah and shall water the brook of Shittim" signifies that there shall be truth out of heaven from the Lord illustrating the knowledges and cognitions that are in the natural man.</p><p>[6] In David:<p>Before Thee thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_8.htm">8</a>).<p>"Pool of waters" and "fountain of waters" here mean truths in abundance, by means of which is the church; for "thou art in travail, O earth," signifies the commencement of the church, which is said "to be in travail" when truths are brought forth therein, "the earth" meaning the church.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>Jehovah sendeth forth springs into the brooks; they go between the mountains. They give drink to the wild beast of the fields; the wild asses quench their thirst. By them the fowl of the heavens dwell (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_10.htm">Psalms 104:10-12</a>).<p>"To send forth springs into the brooks" signifies to give intelligence by means of truths from the Word; "they go between the mountains" signifies that truths will be from the good of love; "the springs" meaning truths from the Word, "the brooks" the things that are of intelligence, and "mountains" the good of love. The instruction of those who are in the good of the church is signified by "they give drink to the wild beast of the fields;" the instruction of those in the church who desire truths is signified by "the wild asses quench their thirst;" that the understanding is thus perfected is signified by "the fowl shall dwell by them." "The wild beast of the fields" mean in the spiritual sense the Gentiles that are in the good of life, "the wild asses" natural truth, "thirst" the desire for truths, and "the fowl of the heavens" thoughts from the understanding.</p><p>[8] In the highest sense, a "fountain" means the Lord in relation to Divine truth or Divine truth from the Lord, consequently the Word, as can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah:<p>My people hath done two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that hold no waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>Here Jehovah, that is, the Lord, calls Himself "the fountain of living waters," which signifies the Word, or Divine truth, consequently the Lord Himself, who is the Word; for it is said, "they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters." "To hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that hold no waters," signifies to frame for themselves doctrinals from self-intelligence, in which there are no truths, "cisterns" meaning doctrinals, "broken cisterns" doctrinals that do not hold together, "that hold no waters" signifies in which there are no truths. Such are the doctrinals that are not from the Word, that is, from the Lord through the Word (for the Lord teaches through the Word), but are from self-intelligence; that these are not from the Lord through the Word is meant by "they have forsaken the fountain of living waters."</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>All that forsake Thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from Me shall be written on the earth, because they have forsaken the fountain of living waters, Jehovah (<a href="../ae/222.htm">222</a>).</p><p>[10] In David:<p>They shall be filled with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the brook of Thy delights; for with Thee is the fountain of life, in Thy light shall we see light (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_36_8.htm">Psalms 36:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_36_9.htm">9</a>).<p>"Fatness" signifies the good of love, and "the brook of delights" truth from that good; "to make to drink" means to teach; "with Thee is the fountain of life" signifies that with the Lord and from Him is Divine truth; because that is what is signified by "the fountain of life" it is added, "in Thy light shall we see light," for "the light of the Lord" means Divine truth.</p><p>[11] In Zechariah:<p>In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for impurity. And in that day I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land; and I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_2.htm">2</a>).<p>This also treats of the Lord's coming. That those who are in the Lord's kingdom will then understand the Word, that is, the Divine truth therein, is signified by "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem," "a fountain" signifying the Word, "the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem" the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The Lord's spiritual kingdom is with those in the heavens and on the earth who are in Divine truths; "for sin and for impurity" signifies the removal of evils and falsities by means of truths from the Word. Because the Word or the Divine truth therein is meant by a "fountain" it is said, "In that day I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land;" "idols" signifying a false religion, "prophets" false doctrine, and "the unclean spirit" evils flowing from the falsities of doctrine; for when a man lives according to the falsities of religion and doctrine he becomes an unclean spirit.</p><p>[12] That Divine truth from the Lord is meant by a "fountain" the Lord Himself teaches in plain words in John:<p>When the Lord sat by Jacob's fountain in the field of Samaria, He said to the woman of Samaria, Everyone that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall not thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto everlasting life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_5.htm">John 4:5-20</a>).<p>It is clear that the "water" that the Lord gives does not mean water, but Divine truth; for it is said that in drinking of the water the woman of Samaria came to draw, one thirsts again, but not of the water that the Lord gives. That "that water shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto everlasting life" means that in that truth is life. That there is life in truths when the Lord gives them may be seen in this article above. The Lord said these things to the woman of Samaria, when He sat by Jacob's fountain, because by the "Samaritans" the Lord meant the Gentiles that were to receive Divine truths from Him; and by the "woman of Samaria" a church constituted of such; and by "Jacob's fountain" Divine truth from Himself, that is, the Word.</p><p>[13] In Moses:<p>Thus Israel dwelt securely alone by the fountain of Jacob (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>).<p>This is in the prophecy of Moses respecting the sons of Israel, in the conclusion of that prophecy. Because "Israel" here signifies the church that is in Divine truths from the Word, therefore it is said "by the fountain of Jacob," which means the Word; so, too, the Lord in relation to the Word, for He is the Word because He is Divine truth, as He Himself teaches in John (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). This is said at the end of that prophecy, because in that prophecy the Word is treated of. "Fountain" has a similar meaning in the prophecy of Israel the father respecting Joseph:<p>The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>).<p>"Fountain" here means the fountain of Jacob, for the field that contained that fountain was given to Joseph by his father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_5.htm">John 4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_6.htm">6</a>). What is signified by "Joseph the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain," may be seen above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_26.htm">Psalms 68:26</a>).<p>In Revelation:<p>I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Then with gladness shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>).<p>In David:<p>All my fountains are in Thee, Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_87_7.htm">Psalms 87:7</a>).</p><p>[14] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so have "fountain" and "fountains," and in that sense they signify the doctrine of falsities, and falsities of doctrine. Thus in Jeremiah:<p>I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>).<p>This is said of Babylon; and her "sea" signifies falsities in one complex, and "fountain" the doctrine of falsity.</p><p>[15] In Hosea:<p>An east wind shall come, the wind of Jehovah, coming up from the wilderness; and his fountain shall become dry, and his spring shall be dried up (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p>This is said of Ephraim, and by him is here meant a perverted understanding of the Word which confirms falsities by means of the Word; its destruction is signified by "his fountain shall become dry, and his spring shall be dried up by the east wind, the wind of Jehovah from the wilderness;" "his fountain" meaning the doctrine of falsity thence, "spring" its falsity, and "the east wind from the wilderness" its destruction by fallacies that are from external sensual things; for external sensual things, when they are not illustrated from things internal, destroy man's understanding, because all fallacies are from that source.</p><p>[16] In David:<p>Thou hast broken up the sea by Thy strength; Thou hast broken the heads of the whales in the waters. Thou hast crushed in the heads of leviathan, and hast given him to be food to the people, for the Ziim. Thou didst cleave fountains and brooks; Thou hast dried up the rivers of strength (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_13.htm">Psalms 74:13-15</a>).<p>Here, too, "fountains" and "brooks" signify false doctrine, which is from self-intelligence; "the rivers of strength" are confirmed principles of falsity therefrom; "the whales" and "leviathan" signify knowledges [scientifica] belonging to the sensual and natural man, from which is all falsity when the spiritual man is closed over them. The sensual and natural man are the seat of what is man's own [proprium], therefore conclusions drawn from those alone are conclusions from one's own [proprium] or from self-intelligence; for the Divine flows in through the spiritual man into the natural, and not into the natural when the spiritual is closed over it, but the spiritual man is opened by means of truths and a life according to them. The "people, the Ziim to whom leviathan is to be given for food," signify those who are in infernal falsities.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "fountains," the Hebrew "brooks." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 483 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>483. "Et deducet eos ad vivos fontes aquarum." - Quod significet in Divinis veris, constat ex significatione "vivorum fontium aquarum", quod sint Divina vera; per "vivum" significatur vivens a Divino, per "fontem" significatur Verbum, et per "aquas" vera inde. In Verbo pluries dicuntur "aquae vivae", et per illas intelliguntur vera quae a Domino veniunt et recipiuntur; quod illa sint viva, est quia Dominus est ipsa Vita, ut Ipse docet; et quod ex ipsa vita venit, hoc vivum est; quod autem ab homine venit, hoc mortuum est. Ut Dominus det vitam veris, influit per bonum in illa, et bonum vivificat; influit etiam e superiori seu interiori, et aperit mentem spiritualem, et ei indit affectionem veri; et affectio veri spiritualis est ipsa vita caeli apud hominem. Haec vita est quae insinuatur homini a Domino per vera. Inde constare potest quid intelligitur per "aquas vivas", et hic per "vivos fontes aquarum", in sequentibus his locis:<p>[2] - Apud Esaiam,<p>"Pauperes et egeni quaerentes aquam, sed non; lingua eorum siti deficit;.... aperiam super clivis fluvios, et in medio vallium fontes ponam, desertum in stagnum aquarum, et terram siccam in scaturigines aquarum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_41_17" target=_top>Esaias 41:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_41_18" target=_top>18</a>):<p>agitur ibi de salvatione gentium a Domino, qui "pauperes et egeni" dicuntur ex defectu et ignorantia veri: desiderium eorum sciendi vera ab illis qui in ecclesia, ubi non vera erant, describitur per quod "quaerant aquas, et non, lingua eorum siti deficit"; "aqua" est verum, "sitire" est desiderare illud: quod instruentur a Domino, significatur per "Aperiam super clivis fluvios, et in medio vallium fontes ponam"; "aperire fluvios" est dare intelligentiam, "in clivis" est in interiori homine, "in medio vallium" est in exteriori homine, "ponere fontes" est instruere in veris: "ponere desertum in stagnum aquarum, et terram siccam in scaturigines aquarum", significat abundantiam veri apud illos qui prius in defectu et in ignorantia fuerunt; "desertum" est ubi non bonum quia non verum, "terra sicca" ubi non verum et inde non bonum; "stagnum aquarum" et "fontes aquarum" significant abundantiam cognitionum veri: ex his manifeste patet quod hic per "aquas", "fontes", "scaturigines, fluvios" et "stagna aquarum", non illa significentur, sed cognitiones veri et inde intelligentia, unde salvatio.<p>[3] Apud eundem,<p>Ecce Deus Vester in vindictam veniet, .... et salvabit vos;.... tunc erit aridus locus in stagnum, et siticulosus in scaturigines aquarum (Esaiam 35:47 <sup>1</sup></p><p>):<p>haec quoque de gentium instructione in veris et illarum reformatione a Domino, cum venturus in mundum, dicta sunt; ac per quod "aridus locus erit in stagnum, et siticulosus in scaturigines aquarum", significantur similia quae mox supra, per quod "desertum erit in stagnum" seu collectionem "aquarum, et terra sicca in scaturigines aquarum."<p>[4] Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Cum fletu venient, et cum precibus adducam eos; ducam eos ad fontes aquarum in via recti, non impingant in ea" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_9" target=_top>31:9</a>):<p>hic quoque de receptione Domini a gentibus agitur; quod instructurus eos in genuinis veris, significatur per quod "ducet eos ad fontes aquarum in via recti, non impingant in ea." <p>Apud Esaiam,<p>"Non esurient et sitient, neque percutiet eos aestus aut sol; nam miserescens eorum ducet eos, <sup>2</sup></p><p>ut et super fontibus aquarum ducturus est eos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_10" target=_top>49:10</a>):<p>hic quoque de instructione gentium a Domino: instructio in veris intelligitur per quod "super fontibus aquarum ducturus sit eos." (Quid significat "esurire" et "sitire", videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_480" target=_top>480</a>; tum quid "aestus" et "sol", etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_481" target=_top>481</a>.)<p>[5] ; quid significatur per quod "montes stillabunt mustum, colles fluent lacte, et omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis", videatur explicatum supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_433" target=_top>433</a> [c]); et quod "fons e domo Jehovae exibit et irrigabit flumen schittim" significat quod e caelo a Domino erit verum illustrans scientifica et cognitiones quae in naturali.<p>[6] Apud Davidem,<p>"Coram" Te "parturis, terra, a coram Deo Jacobi, qui convertit petram in stagnum aquarum, silicem in fontem aquarum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_114_7" target=_top>Psalms 114:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_114_8" target=_top>8</a>):<p>per "stagnum aquarum" et per "fontem aquarum" hic quoque intelliguntur vera in copia, per quae ecclesia; nam per "parturis, terra" significatur incohatio ecclesiae, quae tunc "parturire" dicitur quando ibi producuntur vera; "terra" est ecclesia.<p>[7] Apud eundem,<p>Jehovah "qui emittit fontes in fluvios, inter montes eant, potum praebent ferae agrorum, frangunt onagri sitim suam, juxta illos avis caelorum habitat" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_104_10-12" target=_top>Psalms 104:10-12</a>):<p>"emittere fontes in fluvios" significat dare intelligentiam per vera e Verbo; "inter montes eant" significat quae ex bono amoris erunt; "fontes" sunt vera ex Verbo, "fluvii" sunt illa quae intelligentiae sunt, et "montes" sunt bona amoris: instructio eorum qui in ecclesiae bono sunt, significatur per quod "potum praebeant ferae agrorum"; instructio eorum in ecclesia qui desiderant vera, significatur per quod "frangent onagri sitim"; quod inde intellectus perficiatur, significatur per quod "juxta illos avis habitet"; per "feras agrorum" in sensu spirituali intelliguntur gentes quae in bono vitae sunt; per "onagros" naturale verum; per "sitim" desiderium ad vera; et per "avem caelorum" significantur cogitationes ex intellectu.<p>[8] Quod per "fontem" in supremo sensu intelligatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, seu Divinum Verum a Domino, proinde Verbum, constare potest a sequentibus his locis:<p>- Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Duo mala fecit populus meus, Me deseruerunt Fontem aquarum vivarum, ad excidendum sibi foveas, foveas confractas quae non continent aquas" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_2_13" target=_top>2:13</a> <sup>3</sup></p><p>):<p>hic Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, Se vocat "Fontem aquarum vivarum", per quem significatur Verbum seu Divinum Verum, proinde Ipse Dominus qui est Verbum; nam dicitur, "Me deseruerunt Fontem aquarum vivarum": "ad excidendum sibi foveas, foveas confractas quae non continent aquas", significat ad fingendum sibi doctrinalia ex propria intelligentia, in quibus non vera; "foveae" sunt doctrinalia, "foveae confractae" sunt doctrinalia quae non cohaerent, "quae non continent aquas" significat in quibus non vera: talia sunt doctrinalia quae non ex Verbo, hoc est, a Domino per Verbum (nam Dominus per Verbum docet), sed ex propria intelligentia; quod non a Domino per Verbum, intelligitur per quod "deseruerint Fontem aquarum vivarum."<p>[9] Apud eundem,<p>"Omnes relinquentes Te pudefient, et recedentes a Me in terra scribentur; quia deseruerunt Fontem aquarum vivarum Jehovam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_17_13" target=_top>17:13</a>):<p>hic similiter Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, Se vocat "Fontem aquarum vivarum", a Divino Vero quod ab Ipso; "in terra scribi" significat damnari (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_222" target=_top>222</a> [d]).</p><p>[10] Apud Davidem,<p>"Implentur pinguedine domus tuae, et flumine deliciarum potas eos, quia Tecum fons vitae, in luce tua videmus lucem" (Psalms 36:9, 10 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_36_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_36_9" target=_top>9</a>]):<p>per "pinguedinem" significatur bonum amoris, et per "flumen deliciarum" verum ex illo bono; "potare" est docere: "Tecum fons vitae" significat quod cum Domino et ex Ipso sit Divinum Verum; quia id per "fontem vitae significatur, ideo etiam dicitur, "In luce tua videmus lucem"; per "lucem" Domini significatur Divinum Verum.</p><p>[11] Apud Sachariam,<p>"In die illo erit fons apertus domui Davidis, et habitatoribus Hierosolymae, pro peccato et immunditie:.... et in die illo.... exscindam nomina idolorum e terra, .... etiam prophetas et spiritum immundum transire faciam e terra" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_13_1" target=_top>13:1</a> [, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_13_2" target=_top>2</a>]):<p>etiam haec de adventu Domini: quod tunc intellecturi sint Verbum, seu Divinum Verum inibi, illi qui in regno Domini sunt, significatur per "In die illo erit fons apertus domui Davidis, et habitatoribus Hierosolymae"; "fons" significat Verbum, "domus Davidis et habitatores Hierosolymae" regnum spirituale Domini; regnum Domini spirituale est apud illos in caelis et in terris qui in Divinis veris sunt: "pro peccato et immunditie" significat remotionem malorum et falsorum per vera ex Verbo: quia per "fontem" intelligitur Verbum seu Divinum Verum inibi, ideo dicitur, "In die illo exscindam nomina idolorum, etiam prophetas et spiritum immundum transire faciam e terra"; per "idola" significatur falsa religio, per "prophetas" falsa doctrina, et per "spiritum immundum" mala scaturientia ex falsis doctrinae; nam dum vivitur secundum falsa religionis et doctrinae fit spiritus immundus.</p><p>[12] Quod Divinum Verum a Domino intelligatur per "fontem", manifestis verbis docet Ipse Dominus apud Johannem,<p>Cum Dominus consedit ad fontem Jacobi in agro samariae, dixit mulieri Samaritidi, "Omnis qui bibit ex aqua hac, sitiet iterum; qui vero biberit ex aqua quam Ego dabo ei, non sitiet in aeternum; sed aqua quam dabo ei, fiet in eo fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_4_5-20" target=_top>4:5-20</a>):<p>quod per "aquam", quam Dominus dat, non intelligatur aqua, sed Divinum Verum, manifeste constat, nam dicitur quod ex aqua illa quam mulier Samaritis venit ad hauriendum, sitiatur iterum, non autem ex aqua quam Dominus dat; quod vita in illo Vero sit, intelligitur per quod illa aqua "in eo fiet fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam ": (quod vita in veris sit, cum Dominus illa dat, videatur supra in hoc articulo): quod Dominus haec dixerit mulieri Samaritidi, cum consedit, juxta fontem Jacobi, erat causa, quia per "Samaritas" intellexit Dominus gentes, qui recepturi Divina vera ab Ipso; et per "mulierem Samaritidem" ecclesiam ex illis; et quia per "fontem Jacobi" intellexit Divinum Verum a Se, seu Verbum.</p><p>[13] Apud Mosen,<p>"Ita habitavit Israel secure solitarius apud fontem Jacobi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_28" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:28</a>):<p>haec in prophetia Mosis de filiis Israelis, quae prophetia per haec concluditur. Quia "Israel" ibi significat ecclesiam quae in Divinis veris ex Verbo est, ideo dicitur "ad fontem Jacobi", per quem intelligitur Verbum; ita quoque Dominus quoad Verbum, Ipse enim est Verbum; quia est Divinum Verum, ut Ipse docet apud Johannem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1-3" target=_top>1:1-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>). Haec dicta sunt in fine prophetiae illius, quia in prophetia illa agitur de Verbo. Simile per "fontem" illum etiam intelligitur in prophetia Israelis patris de Josepho,<p>"Filius fecundae Josephus, filius fecundae juxta fontem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_22" target=_top>Genesis 49:22</a>):<p>per "fontem" hic intelligitur fons Jacobi, nam ager in quo ille fons, datus erat Josepho a patre ejus (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_4_5" target=_top>Johannes 4:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_4_6" target=_top>6</a>): quid significatur per "Filius fecundae Josephus, filius fecundae juxta fontem", videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_483/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_448" target=_top>448</a> [b]).
