<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 419</h4><p>419. That the wind should not blow. - That this signifies lest the good should be hurt, and the evil rejected before the day, is evident from the signification of wind as denoting the proceeding Divine, which is the Divine Good united with the Divine Truth; therefore, that "the wind should not blow," signifies that it might flow in softly and gently. "That that wind should not blow upon the earth" signifies that the good should not be injured, and the evil rejected before the day, for the reason that separations of the good from the evil, and castings out of the evil, in the spiritual world, are effected by various degrees of modification and of intensity of the Divine which proceeds from the Lord as the Sun. When this flows in gently, then the good are separated from the evil; and when powerfully, the evil are rejected. The reason for this is that when the Divine from the Lord flows in gently, there is everywhere a state of calm and serenity, in which every one appears such as he is as to the state of his good, for then every one stands forth in the light; wherefore, those who are in good from a spiritual origin are then separated from those who are in good from a natural origin only; for the Lord looks upon those who are in spiritual good, leads them, and thus separates them. Those who are in good from a spiritual origin, are they of whom it is afterwards said, that they are sealed upon their foreheads, for they are spiritual, and angels of heaven; but those who are in good from a natural origin only, are not good, because they are not spiritual, for the good which they seem to have is evil, because it regards itself and the world as an end. They do good in an external form for their own glory, honour, and gain, and not for their neighbour's good; and, therefore, they do good only to gain the respect of men. The merely natural are those who are not sealed, and who are afterwards rejected. But when the Divine from the Lord flows in powerfully, then the goods which the evil have are dissipated, because in themselves they are not goods, but evils, and evils cannot sustain the influx of the Divine; therefore it comes to pass, that their exteriors are closed, and this being the case, their interiors are opened, in which there is nothing but evils and the falsities thence; and so they come into grief, anguish, and torment, and, on account of these, cast themselves down into the hells, where there are similar evils and falsities.</p><p>[2] When the influx of the Divine is intensified, which is the case when the evil are to be removed, then lower down in the spiritual world there arises a strong wind, like a storm or tempest; this wind is what is called in the Word the east wind, which we shall also speak of presently. Hence also the casting down of the evil is described in the Word by strong and impetuous winds, by storms and tempests. By the wind of Jehovah is signified the same as by the spirit of Jehovah, for the wind of respiration is meant, which is also called breath; therefore in the Hebrew tongue, and in many other languages, spirit and wind are expressed by the same word. This is the reason why the greater part of men have no other idea of spirit and of spirits, than as of wind, such as the wind of respiration; and so the opinion prevails in the learned world also that spirits and angels are like wind, possessing only the power of thought. This also is the reason why few suffer themselves to be convinced that spirits and angels are men, possessing a body, face, and organs of sensation, like men in this world. The reason why by wind and breath, when used in reference to man, is signified the life of truth, or a life according to the truths or precepts of the Lord, is that respiration, which is the function of the lungs, corresponds to that life, while the heart and its motion correspond to the life of good; for there are two lives, which make one in man, the life of truth, and the life of good. The life of truth is the life of his understanding, but the life of good is the life of his will; for truths reside in the understanding, because they constitute the understanding, but goods reside in the will, because they constitute the will. The same is signified in the Word by the soul and heart, when they are mentioned together.</p><p>[3] From these considerations it is evident that the wind and spirit of Jehovah mean the Divine Truth; and the four winds, the Divine Truth united with Divine Good. Since wind means the wind or breath of respiration, which signifies Divine Truth and spiritual life in those who receive it therefore that wind is also called the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah, the breath of his mouth, and respiration, as is evident from the following passages.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"I beheld, and sinews and flesh came up" upon the dry bones, "and the skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus saith the Lord Jehovih; Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_8.htm">37:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">9</a>).<p>It was shewn in the preceding article, that dry bones here denote those in whom there is no spiritual life, or in whom there is not any life by means of the Divine Truth. The inbreathing of it by the Lord, is signified by, "Prophesy unto the spirit, and say to the spirit, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." It is evident that by the spirit here named is meant the spirit of respiration, for there were nerves, flesh, and skin, but as yet there was no respiration; therefore it is said, "Say unto the spirit, Breathe upon these." Hence it is evident that spirit or wind signifies spiritual life. That common respiration is not meant, is plain from the fact that it is said, that those dry bones were the house of Israel, that is, that it was destitute of spiritual life; and from its being afterwards said of them, "I will put my spirit in you, that ye may live, and I will place you in your own land" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_14.htm">Ezekiel 37:14</a>); which signifies that they were to be regenerated in order that a church might be formed from them. Regeneration is effected by a life according to Divine Truth, from which there is spiritual life; and to be placed in their own land, signifies to become a church, the land of Canaan signifying the church.</p><p>[4] In Moses:<p>Jehovah "breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man became a living soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>).<p>Here also, in the sense of the letter, is meant the wind of respiration, since it is said he breathed into his nostrils; but that spiritual life is meant, which is the life of intelligence and wisdom by means of Divine Truth, is evident from its being said that He breathed the breath of lives, and that man thus became a living soul. The breath of lives and living soul denote spiritual life; for, without this soul man is called dead, although he lives so far as the body and the senses are concerned. It is therefore plain that soul, spirit, and wind, in the Word, mean spiritual life.</p><p>[5] In John:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, "Peace be unto you; as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3883.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3883-3896</a>). All who are in the spiritual world also are known as to their quality from their respiration alone. Those who are in the life of the respiration of heaven, are amongst the angels; but those who are not in that respiration, cannot breathe if they come into heaven, and so they suffer pain as though from suffocation. Concerning this fact, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1119.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1119</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3887.htm">3887</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3889.htm">3889</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3892.htm">3892</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3893.htm">3893</a>). It is in agreement with this correspondence that the term inspiration is used, that the prophets are said to be inspired, and the Word divinely inspired.</p><p>[6] From these observations the signification of these words of the Lord in John is evident:<p>"Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the spirit" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_8.htm">8</a>).<p>To be born again means to be regenerated; and because man is regenerated by a life according to Divine Truth, and all Divine Truth by which he is regenerated proceeds from the Lord, and flows into man without his knowledge, it is therefore said, "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth." Thus is described the life of the spirit of man, which he has by regeneration; wind denoting the Divine Truth, by which that life is acquired. Man during his abode in the world, does not at all know how this flows in from the Lord, for he then thinks from his natural man, and has a faint perception only of anything which flows from the spiritual man into the natural, therefore this is what is meant by "Thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth." The water of which man is born signifies truth from the Word, and the spirit a life according to it.</p><p>[7] That water signifies truth, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>), and that the anointed of Jehovah signifies the same, see above (n. <a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>). Hence it is said, "the breath of our nostrils, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live;" for breath and wind of the nostrils, in the highest sense, signify the Divine Truth, as said above. That the Divine Truth perished by means of the falsities of evil, is signified by being taken in their pits, pits denoting the falsities of evil.</p><p>[8] Again, in Lamentations:<p>"Thou hast heard my voice," Jehovah "hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_3_56.htm">3:56</a>).<p>"To hide thine ear at my breathing, at my cry," signifies, in regard to worship, confession, and prayers, which are from truths and goods, for all worship, confession, and prayer must be from both truths and goods, in order to be heard. If from truths alone, they are not heard, because there is no life in them, for the life of truth is from good. Breathing is there spoken of truths, and cry, of goods. That cry is spoken of goods will be seen elsewhere.</p><p>[9] Again, in Moses:<p>"All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of lives, of all that was upon the dry land, died" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_7_22.htm">Genesis 7:22</a>).<p>Every one can see that these words in the sense of the letter mean, that every thing upon the earth was destroyed by the flood, thus all men, except Noah and his sons; but what they signify in the spiritual sense, may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_135_17.htm">Psalm 135:17</a>).<p>No breath in their mouth, signifies that there was no truth in their thought, for mouth signifies thought.</p><p>[10] Again, in Jeremiah:<p>"And the wild asses breathed out the wind like whales; their eyes are consumed because there is no herb" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_5.htm">14:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_6.htm">6</a>).<p>To breathe out the wind like whales, signifies, that no truth was granted them; and "because there is no herb," denotes that there was no truth in the church. Since the evil are cast down by a more vehement influx of Divine Truth and Good, proceeding from the Lord as the Sun, as stated above, therefore, also, the casting down of those who are in the falsities of evil is described by the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah; as in Isaiah:<p>"For Tophet is prepared of old; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah like a stream of brimstone doth kindle them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_33.htm">30:33</a>).<p>In David:<p>"The channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>"And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were heaped up together. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_10.htm">10</a>).<p>And in Job:<p>"They that plough iniquity, by the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_4_8.htm">Job 4:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_4_9.htm">9</a>).<p>By the blast, breath, and breathing of the nostrils of Jehovah, is meant the proceeding Divine, by which the evil are dispersed and cast down, when it flows in strongly and with intensity. But this influx will be spoken of in what follows, where storms, tempests, and the east wind, are treated of.</p><p>[11] That the wind of the earth signifies the proceeding Divine, arises also from correspondence with the winds in the spiritual world. For winds also exist in the spiritual world, arising from the direction of the influx of the Divine, and they extend to the lower parts of the earth there. In the heavens rarely any but gentle winds are perceived; but they are frequently perceived with those who dwell below upon the lands (terroe), for they increase in proportion to descent. Their directions are from the quarters into which the Divine flows, especially from the north; and because the winds there have a spiritual origin, they therefore also signify spiritual things, in general the Divine Truth, from which they exist. Thus, in David:<p>Jehovah "layeth his chambers in the waters; he maketh the clouds his chariot; he walketh upon the wings of the wind; he maketh his angels winds; his ministers a flaming fire" (<a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>). That angels are called angels from the reception of Divine Truth, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130:2</a>, <a href="../ae/412.htm">412:7</a>), and that ministers are called ministers from the reception of Divine Good, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/155.htm">155</a>); and that fire signifies the good of love (n. <a href="../ae/68.htm">68</a>).</p><p>[12] Again, in David:<p>Jehovah "Bowed the heavens, and came down; and thick darkness was under his feet. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he was borne upon the wings of the wind" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">10</a>).<p>By Jehovah bowing to the heavens and coming down, is signified the visitation, which precedes a last judgment; by the thick darkness under His feet, are signified falsities of evil in the lower parts; by His riding upon a cherub, His flying, and being carried upon the wings of the wind is signified Omnipresence with the Divine, and the wings of the wind denote Divine Truth in ultimates, as above.</p><p>[13] Again, in Jeremiah:<p>"He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding. When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_12.htm">10:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_15.htm">51:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_16.htm">16</a>).<p>And again, in David:<p>"He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_135_7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>).<p>These things in the spiritual sense, describe the reformation of man, and the establishment of the church. From this reformation and this establishment the Lord is called the Maker of the earth, and elsewhere the Former and Creator; earth denoting the church. The Divine Good by means of which reformation is effected, is signified by His establishing the world by His wisdom; world denotes the church, and has reference to good. The Divine Truth by means of which this is also effected, is signified by, the voice which he uttereth, a multitude of waters in the heavens. The voice which he uttereth, signifies the influx of the Divine Truth; the multitude of waters in the heavens, signifies reception, waters denoting truths. Ultimate truths, which are knowledges from the sense of the letter of the Word, are signified by vapours from the end of the earth; spiritual things thence are signified by lightnings for the rain, lightnings having reference to the light of heaven, and rain to influx; reformation thence by means of Divine Truth from the Lord, is signified by, "He bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries." All these things are in this way understood in the heavens.</p><p>[14] Again, in David:<p>"He casteth forth his hail like morsels: who can stand before his cold? He sendeth out his Word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. He declareth his Word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_17.htm">Psalm 147:17-19</a>).<p>By these words also, reformation is described, but in regard to the natural man; the scientifics therein, and the knowledges which a man possesses before reformation are signified by, "Hail like morsels; who can stand before his cold?" For man previous to reformation is altogether cold, and that cold is also distinctly felt when the Divine flows in out of heaven; and because such cold is dissipated when the Divine Good and the Divine Truth are received, that is when reformation takes place, it is therefore said, "He sendeth out his Word, and melteth them; he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow." By the Word is signified the Divine Good united with the Divine Truth; by the wind is signified Divine Truth, and by the waters flowing, the reception of truth; and because this is the signification of the above words, it is therefore added, "He declareth his Word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel." Jacob and Israel signify the church, the former, the church which is in good, the latter, the church which is in truths. Statutes and judgments denote external and internal truths from good.</p><p>[15] So again:<p>"Praise Jehovah; fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his Word" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalm 148:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_8.htm">8</a>).<p>It is evident that fire and hail, snow and vapour, and wind signify things different from these; for what purpose could be served in the Divine Word by saying that they should praise Jehovah? But by fire and hail, snow and vapours, are signified the delights of the loves of the natural man, and his scientifics and knowledges; for these, before man is reformed and made spiritual, are fire, and hail, and snow and vapour; and the sphere of their life, when it flows forth from them causes similar things to appear in the spiritual world. To worship the Lord from those things, is signified by their praising Jehovah, for to praise is to worship. But by the stormy wind is signified the Divine Truth as to reception; wherefore it is also said, stormy wind fulfilling his Word. To fulfil His Word signifies to receive in the life the things pertaining to doctrine.</p><p>[16] Because everything in the Word has also an opposite sense, so also has wind, and in that sense it signifies falsity, as in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Behold they are all iniquity, their works are naught; their molten images are wind and emptiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_29.htm">41:29</a>).<p>Wind and emptiness denote the falsities of evil, and the evils of falsity; wind denotes the falsities of evil, and emptiness, the evils of falsity; for where there is emptiness and vacuity, or, in other words, where there is neither good nor truth, there are evil and falsity. That falsities are there signified by wind is plain, from the fact that it is said, "They are all iniquity, their works are naught"; and also because it is said, "their molten images are wind and emptiness"; for molten images signify the things which man brings forth from his own intelligence, all of which are evils and falsities.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"The prophets shall become wind, and the Word is not in them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_13.htm">5:13</a>).<p>Prophets signify those who teach truths, and in the abstract, truths of doctrine, but in this case falsities of doctrine which are signified by wind; therefore it is also said, "the Word is not in them," the Word signifying the Divine Truth.</p><p>[17] Again:<p>"I will scatter them as the stubble that passeth away unto the wind of the desert" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_13_24.htm">13:24</a>).<p>The wind of the desert signifies where there is no truth, consequently, where there is only falsity; for desert in the Word signifies where there is no good, because there is no truth.<p>Again in the same prophet:<p>"The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_22_22.htm">22:22</a>).<p>Shepherds in the Word signify those who teach the good of life and lead to it, this being accomplished by means of truths, but in this case, by shepherds are meant those who do not teach the good of life, still less lead to it, because they are in falsities; this is meant by, "the wind shall feed all thy shepherds," wind denoting the falsity which they seize upon and love. The lovers who shall go into captivity signify the delights of the love of self and the love of the world, and therefore the delights of the evil; lovers denote those delights, and captivity denotes detention in the hells.</p><p>[18] Again in Hosea:<p>"Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind; he daily multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with the Assyrian, and oil is carried into Egypt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_12_1.htm">12:1</a>).<p>Ephraim signifies the Intellectual of the church; the Assyrian, reasoning; and Egypt, the Scientific; therefore by, "Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind," is signified that those in the church who are intelligent take up with falsities by means of which truths are completely driven out, for wind denotes what is false, and the east wind falsity withering and dissipating truths. Because of this signification of wind and the east wind, it is also said, "he daily multiplieth lies and desolation," a lie denoting falsity, and desolation the dissipation of truth. By their making a covenant with the Assyrian, and by oil being carried into Egypt, is signified, that by reasoning from scientifics falsely applied, they pervert the truths and goods of the church. To make a covenant with the Assyrian, signifies to reason from falsities and to destroy truths, and to carry oil into Egypt, signifies to destroy the good of the church by means of scientifics. For he who is in principles of falsity applies to them the scientifics which he has received from childhood, for his understanding sees nothing else, since the understanding is formed from either truths or falsities; if from truths, then a man sees truths, if from falsities, then he sees falsities, and these he sees in the natural man, in whose memory scientifics reside, from which he selects such as favour his ideas, and those which do not favour them are either perverted or rejected.</p><p>[19] Again, in the same prophet:<p>"Ephraim is joined to idols. Their wine is gone; they have committed whoredom continually; they have loved; they have added shame to her shield. The wind hath bound her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices" (<a href="../ae/417.htm">417:7</a>).</p><p>[20] Again, in Ezekiel:<p>"And a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them" (<a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-102</a>). The hair of the head and the hair of the beard being the ultimates of man, correspond to the ultimates of truth and good. The ultimates of truth and good are of such a quality as the ultimate truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. That these ultimates were perverted, falsified, and adulterated by the Jews, is signified by what is stated here concerning the hair of the head and of the beard of the prophet. A third part of the hair being scattered into every wind signifies the dissipation of all truth; when this is the case mere falsities are seized upon, and it is therefore said, "I will draw out a sword after them," a sword signifying the destruction of truth by falsity. See above (n. <a href="../ae/131.htm">131</a>). Without the knowledge of this signification of the hair, who could understand what is involved in the command given to the prophet, that he should shave off the hair of his head and of his beard, burn a third part of it with fire in the midst of the city, take a third part and smite about it with a sword, and scatter a third part into every wind, and draw out a sword after them?</p><p>[21] That the falsification of truth by the Jews is signified by these things is very evident from what follows in the same chapter, where, among other things, it is said, "This is Jerusalem. And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her" (<a href="../ae/411.htm">411</a>).</p><p>[22] It has been before stated, that in the spiritual world, just as in the natural world, strong winds and storms exist; but the storms in the spiritual world exist from the influx of the Divine into the lower parts where those are who are in evils and falsities. That influx, as it descends out of the heavens towards the lands (terroe), which are below, becomes denser and has the appearance of clouds which with the evil are dense and opaque, according to the degree and quality of their evil. These clouds are appearances of falsity from evil, and arise from the spheres of their life, for every angel and every spirit is encompassed by the sphere of his life. When the Divine goes forth powerfully from the Lord as the Sun, and flows into these dense and opaque clouds, a storm arises which is seen by the spirits there just as storms are seen by men on the earth. I was sometimes permitted to have experience of these storms, and also of the east wind, by which the evil were dispersed and cast into the hells, at the time when the Last Judgment was taking place. It is clear from these considerations what storms, tempests, and impetuous winds signify in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Thou shalt scatter them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall disperse them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, his fury has gone forth, even a grievous whirlwind; it shall burst upon the head of the wicked" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_30_23.htm">30:23</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"I will hasten my escape from the stormy wind and tempest" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_55_8.htm">Psalm 55:8</a>).<p>Again:<p>"O my God, pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy storm" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_83_13.htm">Psalm 83:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_83_15.htm">15</a>).<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>"I will make the storm-winds to burst through in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower, in mine anger, for a consummation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_13_13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"Evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the sides of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>).<p>Again in Isaiah:<p>"Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah of hosts with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>).<p>And in Amos:<p>"I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rahab, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with a tempest in the day of the storm" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_1_14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>).<p>And in Zechariah:<p>"The Lord Jehovih shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with the tempests of the south" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>).<p>In Nahum:<p>"Jehovah hath his way in the tempest and in the storm" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p>In David:<p>"Upon the wicked, the wind of the tempests, the portion of the cup of the wicked" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_11_6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>).<p>Again:<p>"God shall come and shall not keep silence; and it shall be very tempestuous round about him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>"They sow the wind, and they shall reap the tempest" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_8_7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>).<p>In these passages storms and tempests signify the dispersion of falsities and evils, because those who are in falsities of evil are cast down into hell by a stormy wind.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>"They who go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, and lifteth up the waves thereof. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_29.htm">29</a>).<p>These things refer to temptations and liberation from them; the stormy wind, and the lifting up of the waves of the sea signify temptations, because spiritual temptations are caused by falsities rushing into the thoughts, from which arise pains of conscience and grief of mind and soul, and these are signified by "He raiseth the stormy wind and lifteth up the waves thereof." Liberation from them is signified by, "He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still."</p><p>[24] The same is signified by these words in Mark:<p>"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow; and they awoke him, and say unto him, Carest thou not that we perish? And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_4_37.htm">Mark 4:37-39</a>).<p>Also in Luke:<p>"As they sailed he fell asleep; and there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy. And they came to him and awoke him, saying Master, Master, we perish. Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_23.htm">Luke 8:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_24.htm">24</a>).<p>This, like all the miracles of the Lord, contains arcana of heaven, and interior things of the church. Divine miracles differ from those that are not divine in this, that Divine miracles also signify Divine things, because the Divine is in them, but miracles not divine have no signification, because there is nothing of the Divine in them. And, moreover, in the description of the Divine miracles in the Word, and in every detail of it, there is a spiritual sense. The above miracle refers to spiritual temptations. The great storm of wind that caused the waves to beat into the ship, so that it was full, signifies those temptations; and deliverance from these is signified by Jesus awakening when they were in great fear, rebuking the wind, and saying to the sea, "Peace, be still;" and by the ceasing of the wind, and the great calm. Every word contains a spiritual sense. We shall not here however explain it in detail, but merely say that a whirlwind and a tempest signify temptations, which are irruptions of falsities, or inundations of the mind by falsities. This is also evident from the fact that the wind and the waves were rebuked, and from the Lord's words to the sea, "Peace, be still," as being said to those things, or to those who induce temptations.</p><p>[25] Moreover the winds in the spiritual world, appear to arise from different quarters, some from the south, some from the north, and some from the east. Those which come from the south disperse truths with those who are in falsities, and those which come from the east disperse goods with those who are in evils. The reason why winds disperse these, is, that winds exist from a strong and powerful influx of the Divine through the heavens into the lower parts, [of the world of spirits], and where the influx reaches, it fills truths and goods, that is the minds and souls of those who are in truths and goods, with the Divine. Therefore those whose minds and souls are merely falsities and evils as to the interiors, and truths mingled with falsities, and goods with evils as to the exteriors, cannot sustain such influx from the Divine, and consequently they betake themselves to their own falsities and evils which they actually love, and reject the truths and goods which they love merely for the sake of themselves and of appearances.</p><p>[26] The effect produced by the wind coming from the east, called the east wind, is evident from what we have stated, for it disperses all the goods and truths of which the evil had made an external display before the world, and talked about for the sake of appearance, therefore withering and drying up are ascribed to this wind. "Withered" signifies a state in which there is no good, and "dried up" a state in which there is no truth. This is evident from those passages of the Word, where this wind is mentioned.<p>Thus, in Ezekiel:<p>Behold the planted vine. "Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_17_10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>).<p>Again, in the same:<p>The vine "was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit; the rods of her strength were broken and withered" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_19_12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>Ephraim, "fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of Jehovah shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up; it shall spoil the treasure of every vessel of desire" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p>And in Jonah:<p>"And it came to pass when the sun arose, that God prepared a withering east wind" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_4_8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>).</p><p>[27] That the east wind also destroys everything where the evil are, their lands (terroe), their dwellings, and their treasures, may be seen in the small work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>); which brought the locust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_10_13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>). It is called a rough wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>) breaking the ships of Tarshish (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_48_7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>); breaking in the heart of the seas (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>); and scattering enemies (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 419</h4><p>419. That the wind should not blow, signifies that the good be not injured, and the evil be not cast out before the day. This is evident from the signification of "wind," as meaning the Divine proceeding, which is Divine good united to Divine truth; therefore "that the wind should not blow" signifies that the influx might be moderate and gentle; "the wind not blowing upon the earth" signifies that the good may not be injured, and the evil cast out before the day, because the separations of the good from the evil and the casting out of the evil in the spiritual world are effected by various degrees of moderation and intensity of the Divine proceeding from the Lord as a sun. When this flows in moderately the good are separated from the evil, and when it flows in intensely the evil are cast out; and for the following reasons: when the Divine from the Lord flows in moderately there is everywhere tranquillity and serenity, wherein all appear such as they are in respect to the state of their good, for all then stand forth in light; consequently those who are in good from a spiritual origin are then separated from those who are in good merely from a natural origin; for the Lord looks upon those who are in spiritual good and leads them, and thus separates them. Those who are in good from a spiritual origin are those referred to in what follows where they are said "to be sealed on their foreheads," for they are spiritual, and are angels of heaven; but those who are merely in good from a natural origin are not good because they are not spiritual, for the good appearing with them is evil, because it has regard to self and the world as an end. Such do good in external form with reference to their own glory, honor, and gain, and not with reference to the neighbor's good, consequently they do good only that they may be seen of men. Those who are merely natural are those who are "not sealed," and who are afterwards rejected. But when the Divine from the Lord flows in intensely, the goods with the evils are dispersed, because these goods are in themselves not goods but evils, and evils do not endure the influx of the Divine. This causes the externals in such to be closed up, and when these are closed up the interiors are opened, in which there is nothing except evils and falsities therefrom; and this brings them into pain, anguish, and torment, on account of which they cast themselves down into the hells, where there are evils and falsities like their own.</p><p>[2] When the influx of the Divine is intensified, which occurs when the evil are to be cast out, then lower down in the spiritual world a wind springs up that blows strongly like a storm or tempest; this wind is what is called in the Word "the east wind" (of which presently). The casting down of the evil is described also in the Word by violent and impetuous winds, by storms, and by tempests. "The wind of Jehovah" has a similar signification as "the spirit of Jehovah," for the wind of respiration is meant, which is also called spirit (or breath). On this account in the Hebrew and many other languages spirit is expressed by the same word as wind. This is why the greater part of mankind have no other idea of spirit and of spirits than of wind like the wind of respiration; and from this have come the notions in the learned world also that spirits and angels are like wind in which there is merely a vital principle of thought; and this is the reason also that so few of these allow themselves to be persuaded that spirits and angels are men, endowed with body, face, and organs of sensation, like men on the earth. "Wind" and "spirit," in reference to man, signify the life of truth, or a life according to the truths or precepts of the Lord, because respiration, which pertains to the lungs, corresponds to that life, while the heart and its motion corresponds to the life of good. For there are two lives, which should make one in man, the life of truth and the life of good; the life of truth is the life of man's understanding, while the life of good is the life of his will; for truths have their seat in the understanding because these constitute the understanding, while goods have their seat in the will because these constitute the will. "Soul and heart," in the Word, when mentioned together, have a similar significance.</p><p>[3] From this it can be seen what is meant by "the wind" and "the spirit of Jehovah," namely, the Divine truth, and by "the four winds," Divine truth united to Divine good. Since wind means the wind or breath of respiration, and it signifies Divine truth and spiritual life with those who receive it, so this wind is called also "the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah," and also "the breath of His mouth," and "breathing;" as can be seen from the following passages. <p>In Ezekiel:<p>And I saw, and upon the dry bones, sinews and flesh came up, and skin covered them above, yet there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, Prophesy about the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus the Lord Jehovih hath said, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_8.htm">Ezekiel 37:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">9</a>).<p>What is here signified by "the dry bones" was told in the preceding article, namely, those who have no spiritual life, or no life through Divine truth. The breathing in of this life by the Lord is signified by "Prophesy about the spirit, and say to the spirit, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." Here "spirit" evidently means the breath of respiration, for there were sinews, flesh, and skin, but as yet no breathing; therefore it is said, "Say to the spirit, Breathe upon them." From this it can be seen that this "spirit" or "wind" signifies spiritual life. That common breathing was not meant is evident from its being said that "these dry bones were the house of Israel," meaning that the house of Israel was without spiritual life; and from its being said of them afterwards, "I will put My spirit in you, that ye may live, and I will place you in your own land that ye may live" ( <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_14.htm">Ezekiel 37:14</a>); which signifies that they are to be regenerated that a church may be made of them. Regeneration is effected by a life according to Divine truth, from which is spiritual life; and "to bring them back to the land" signifies that they may become a church, the land of Canaan signifying the church.</p><p>[4] In Moses:<p>Jehovah God breathed into his nostrils <sup>1</sup>the soul of lives, and man became a living soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>).<p>Here, too, in the sense of the letter, the wind of breathing is meant, as it is said He "breathed into his nostrils;" but spiritual life, which is the life of intelligence and wisdom through Divine truth, is evidently meant, since it is said that He breathed into him "the soul of lives," and that thus man became "a living soul;" "the soul of lives" and "a living soul" meaning spiritual life; for man without that soul is called a dead man, although in respect to the body and the senses he is alive. This, too, makes evident that "soul," "spirit," and "wind" in the Word mean spiritual life.</p><p>[5] In John:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, Peace be unto you; as the Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had said this He breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3883.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3883-3896</a>). The quality of all in the spiritual world is known from their respiration merely. Those who are in the life of the respiration of heaven are among the angels; but those who are not in that respiration, if they come into heaven, are unable to breathe there, and are therefore in anguish like that of suffocation (respecting which see also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1119.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1119</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3887.htm">3887</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3889.htm">3889</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3892.htm">3892</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3893.htm">3893</a>). From this correspondence the term, "inspiration" is derived, and the prophets are called "inspired," and the Word is said to be "Divinely inspired."</p><p>[6] From all this it can be seen what is signified by the Lord's words in John:<p>Except one be born of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it willeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so is everyone that is born of the spirit (<a href="../ae/71.htm">71</a>)</p><p>[7] In Lamentations:<p>The breath [spiritus] of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>; and "the anointed of Jehovah" the same, n. <a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>.) This is why it is said "the breath of our nostrils, of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live;" for "the spirit and breath of the nostrils" signifies in the highest sense Divine truth, as has been said above. That Divine truth perished through falsities of evil is signified by "was taken in their pits;" "pits" meaning the falsities of evil.</p><p>[8] Again in Lamentations:<p>Jehovah Thou hast heard my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_3_56.htm">Lamentations 3:56</a>).<p>"To hide the ear at the breathing and at the cry" signifies at worship, confession, and prayers, which are from truths and from goods; for all worship, confession, and prayer must be from truths and goods; to be heard they must be from both; if they are from truths alone they are not heard, because there is no life in them; the life of truth is from good. "Breathing" is here predicated of truths, and "cry" of goods (that "cry" is predicated of goods will be seen elsewhere).</p><p>[9] In Moses:<p>Everything that had in its nostrils the breath of the spirit of lives, of all that was on the dry land, died (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_7_22.htm">Genesis 7:22</a>).<p>What these words signify in the sense of the letter everyone can see, namely, that all things upon the earth were destroyed by the flood, thus all men then living, except Noah and his sons; but what these words signify in the spiritual sense may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_135_17.htm">Psalms 135:17</a>);<p>"no breath in their mouth" signifying that there was no truth in the thought, for "mouth" signifies thought.</p><p>[10] In Jeremiah:<p>The wild asses pant for breath like whales; their eyes were consumed because there was no herb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a>).<p>"To pant for breath like whales" signifies that there is no truth to be imbibed; "because there was no herb" means because there is no truth in the church. As the evil are cast down by a more powerful influx of Divine truth and good proceeding from the Lord as a sun, as has been said above, so the casting down of those who are in the falsities of evil is described also by "the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah." As in Isaiah:<p>Topheth is prepared of old; the pile thereof is fire and much wood made ready; the breath of Jehovah like a brook of brimstone doth kindle them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>).<p>In David:<p>The channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were disclosed, at the rebuke of Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_15.htm">Psalms 18:15</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>By the breath of Thy nostrils the waters were heaped up; Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_10.htm">10</a>).<p>And in Job:<p>Plotters of iniquity, by the blast of God they perish, by the breath of His nostrils are they consumed (Acts of the Apostles 4:8, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_4_9.htm">9</a>).<p>In all these passages "the blast," "the breath," and "the breathing of the nostrils of Jehovah" means the Divine proceeding, which disperses and casts down the evil when it flows in intensely and strongly; but respecting this influx more will be said in what follows, where "tempests," "storms," and "the east wind" are treated of.</p><p>[11] Again, that "the wind of the earth" also signifies the Divine proceeding is also from correspondence with the winds in the spiritual world; for there exist winds in the spiritual world also, and these arise from the determining of Divine influx, and arise in the lower parts of the earth there. In the heavens rarely any other than gentle winds are perceived; but with those who dwell lower down, upon the lands, winds are frequent, for they grow stronger as they descend; their direction is from the quarters into which the Divine inflows, especially from the north. Because the winds there are from a spiritual origin they also signify spiritual things, in general Divine truth, from which they exist. As in David:<p>Jehovah layeth the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He maketh the clouds His chariot; He walketh upon the wings of the wind; He maketh His angels winds, His ministers a flaming fire (<a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>; that angels are called "angels" from reception of Divine truth, see above, n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/412.htm">412</a>; and that ministers are called "ministers" from the reception of Divine good, see also above, n. <a href="../ae/155.htm">155</a>; and that "fire" signifies the good of love, n. <a href="../ae/68.htm">68</a>)</p><p>[12] In the same:<p>Jehovah bowed the heavens, He came down, and thick darkness was under His feet; and He rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalms 18:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">10</a>).<p>Jehovah "bowed the heavens, He came down," signifies visitation, which precedes the Last Judgment; "thick darkness under His feet" signifies the falsities of evil in lower things; "He rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind," signifies omnipresence with the Divine, "the wings of the wind" meaning Divine truth in ultimates (as above).</p><p>[13] In Jeremiah:<p>The Maker of the earth by His power, He prepareth the world by His wisdom, by His intelligence He stretcheth out the heavens; at the voice that He uttereth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and He maketh the vapors to go up from the end of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries (10 :12, 13; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_15.htm">51:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_16.htm">16</a>).<p>And in David:<p>He maketh the vapors to go up from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; and He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_135_7.htm">Psalms 135:7</a>).<p>This describes in the spiritual sense the reformation of man and the establishment of the church. Because of that reformation and establishment the Lord is called "the Maker of the earth," and elsewhere "the Former" and "Creator;" "earth" meaning the church. The Divine good, by which reformation is effected, is signified by "He prepareth the world by His wisdom;" "world" means the church, and is predicated of good. The Divine truth, which is also a means, is signified by "at the voice that He uttereth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens;" "the voice that He uttereth" signifying the influx of Divine truth, and "the multitude of waters in the heavens" reception; "waters" meaning truths. Ultimate truths, which are the knowledges from the sense of the letter of the Word, are signified by "the vapors from the ends of the earth;" spiritual truths therefrom are signified by "lightnings for the rain," "lightnings" called from the light of heaven, and "rain" from influx; thus reformation through Divine truth from the Lord is signified by "He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries." This is the meaning of all these things in the heavens.</p><p>[14] In David:<p>He casteth forth His hail like morsels; who can stand before His cold? He sendeth His word, He melteth them; He maketh His wind to blow, the waters flow. He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_17.htm">Psalms 147:17-19</a>).<p>This, too, is a description of reformation, but in respect to the natural man. Here knowledges and cognitions which are in man before reformation are signified by "hail like morsels; who can stand before His cold?"-for man before reformation is utterly frigid, and that coldness is also plainly felt when the Divine flows in out of heaven; and as such coldnesses are dissipated by the reception of Divine good and Divine truth, thus by reformation, it is said, "He sendeth His word, He melteth them; He maketh His wind to blow, the waters flow;" "word" signifying Divine good united to Divine truth, "wind" Divine truth, and "the waters flow," the reception of truth; and this being the signification of these words it is added, "He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and judgments unto Israel;" "Jacob" and "Israel" signifying the church, "Jacob" the church that is in good, and "Israel" the church that is in truths; "statutes and judgments" mean external and internal truths which are from good.</p><p>[15] In the same:<p>Praise Jehovah, fire and hail, snow and vapor; stormy wind doing His word (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_8.htm">8</a>).<p>"Fire and hail, snow and vapor, and wind," evidently signify something different from these, for why should it be said of such things in the Divine Word that "they praised Jehovah?" But "fire and hail, and snow and vapors" signify the delights of the loves of the natural man, and its knowledges and cognitions; for these are "fire and hail, and snow and vapor" before man is reformed and made spiritual, the sphere of life of such when it flows out from them, presenting in the spiritual world appearances like these; and the worship of the Lord from these things is signified by their "praising Jehovah," "to praise" meaning to worship; "stormy wind" signifies Divine truth in respect to reception; it is therefore said "stormy wind doing His word;" "doing His word" signifying to receive into life the things of doctrine.</p><p>[16] As all things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so has "wind," and in that sense it signifies falsity, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Behold they are all iniquity, their works are nothing; their molten images are wind and a void (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>).<p>"Wind and a void" mean the falsities of evil and the evils of falsity; "wind" meaning the falsities of evil, and "a void" the evils of falsity; for where there is a void and emptiness, that is, absence of good and truth, there are evil and falsity; "wind" signifies where there are falsities, as is evident from its being said "they are all iniquity, their works are nothing;" also from its being said "their molten images are wind and a void," for "molten images" signify such things as man hatches out of self-intelligence, and these are all falsities and evils. In Jeremiah:<p>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13</a>).<p>"Prophets" signify those who teach truths, and in an abstract sense the truths of doctrine, here the falsities of doctrine; falsities are signified by "wind;" therefore it is added, "the word is not in them," "word" signifying Divine truth.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>I will scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_13_24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>).<p>"The wind of the wilderness" signifies where there is no truth, and therefore falsity, for "wilderness" in the Word signifies where there is no good because there is no truth. In the same:<p>The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_22_22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>).<p>"Shepherds" in the Word signify those who teach the good of life and lead to it, which is done by means of truths; but here "shepherds" mean those who do not teach the good of life, still less lead to it, because they are in falsities; this is meant by "the wind shall feed all thy shepherds;" "wind" meaning the falsity which they seize upon and love; "the lovers" who shall go into captivity, signify the delights of the loves of self and the world, and thence the delights of the evil; "lovers" meaning such delights, and "captivity" detention in the hells.</p><p>[18] In Hosea:<p>Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind; every day he multiplieth lying and devastation, and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried down into Egypt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_12_1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>).<p>"Ephraim" signifies the intellectual of the church; "Assyria" reasoning, and "Egypt" the knowing faculty (scientificum); therefore "Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind," signifies that the intelligent in the church imbue themselves with falsities which altogether disperse truths; "wind" meaning falsity, and "east wind" falsity drying up and dispersing truths. Because of this signification of "wind" and "east wind" it is added, "every day he multiplieth lying and devastation;" "lying" meaning falsity, and "devastation" the dispersion of truth; "they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried down into Egypt," signifies that by reasonings from knowledges (scientifica) falsely applied they pervert the truths and goods of the church; "to make a covenant with Assyria" signifying to reason from falsities and to destroy truths, and "to carry down oil into Egypt" signifying to destroy the good of the church by knowledges [scientifica]; for he who is in principles of falsity applies to them the knowledges [scientifica] he has imbibed from childhood, since his understanding sees nothing else. For the understanding is formed either of truths or of falsities; if of truths, man sees truths, if of falsities he sees falsities; he sees them in the natural man, in the memory of which knowledges [scientifica] have their seat; and from these he selects such as favor his principles, and those that do not favor them he either perverts or rejects.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>Ephraim is joined to idols. Their wine is gone; in whoring they have committed whoredom; they are given up to love; her shields give disgrace. The wind hath bound her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices (<a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>)</p><p>[20] In Ezekiel:<p>A third part thou shalt disperse to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them (<a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-102</a>); therefore the hairs of the head and of the beard, as they are the ultimate things of man, correspond to the ultimates of truth and good. The ultimates of truth and good are such as are the ultimate truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. That these ultimates were perverted, falsified, and adulterated by the Jews is signified by what is here said of the hairs of the prophet's head and beard. "A third part thereof he should disperse unto every wind" signifies the destruction of all truth; and because when truth is destroyed mere falsities are seized on, it is added, "I will draw out a sword after them;" "sword" signifying the destruction of truth by falsity (See above, n. <a href="../ae/131.htm">131</a>). Unless this signification of "hairs" is known, who could understand what is involved in the command to the prophet that "he should shave off the hairs of his head and of his beard, and a third part he should burn in the midst of the city, a third part he should smite with a sword round about it, and a third part he should disperse unto every wind, and that a sword should be drawn out after them"?</p><p>[21] That this signifies the falsification of truth by the Jews is clearly evident from what follows in the same chapter, where among other things it is said:<p>This is Jerusalem; she hath altered My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and My statutes more than the lands that are round about her (<a href="../ae/411.htm">411</a>)</p><p>[22] It has been said above, that in the spiritual world, as in the natural world, strong winds and tempests spring up; but the tempests in the spiritual world spring from the influx of the Divine into the parts below, where those are who are in evils and falsities; as that influx descends from the heavens towards the lands that lie below, it becomes more dense and appears like clouds, and with the evil, dense and dark according to the quantity and quality of the evil. These clouds are appearances of falsity from evil, arising from the spheres of their life; for round about every spirit and angel there is a sphere of life. When from the Lord as a sun the Divine is sent forth powerfully and flows into these dense and dark clouds, a tempest arises which is perceived by spirits there in like manner as tempests on the earth are perceived by men. It has at different times been granted me to perceive these tempests and also the east wind by which the evil were dispersed and cast into the hells, when the Last Judgment was in progress. From this it can be seen what "tempests," "storms," and "violent winds" signify in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Thou shalt disperse them, that the wind may carry them away and the tempest scatter them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, <sup>2</sup>the tempest of Jehovah has gone forth in wrath, a whirling tempest; it shall hurl itself upon the head of the wicked (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_30_23.htm">30:23</a>).<p>In David:<p>I will speed my escape from the rushing wind, from the tempest (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_55_8.htm">Psalms 55:8</a>).<p>In the same:<p>O my God, pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_83_13.htm">Psalms 83:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_83_15.htm">15</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>I will make a wind of tempests to break through in My wrath, and in Mine anger there shall be an overflowing rain, for a consummation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_13_13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Thou shalt be visited of Jehovah of Hosts with tempest, storm and with the flame of a devouring fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with a tempest in the day of storm (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_1_14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>).<p>In Nahum:<p>Jehovah hath His way in the storm and in the tempest (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p>In Zechariah:<p>The Lord Jehovih shall blow with the trumpet, and shall go with tempests of the south (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>).<p>In David:<p>Upon the wicked a wind of storm, the portion of the cup of the wicked (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_11_6.htm">Psalms 11:6</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Our God shall come, and shall not be silent; about Him the tempest shall blow violently (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_3.htm">Psalms 50:3</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>They sow the wind, therefore they shall reap the whirlwind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_8_7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>).<p>In these passages "tempest" and "storm" signify the dispersion of falsities and evils, because those who are in the falsities of evil are cast down into hell by a tempestuous wind.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do work in many waters. And He spake, and maketh the wind of the tempest to stand, and He raised up its waves on high. He made the tempest to stand still, that their waves might be hushed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_23.htm">Psalms 107:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_29.htm">29</a>).<p>This treats of temptations and of the deliverance from them. "The wind of the tempest," and thus "the waves of the sea lifted up," signify temptations; and as spiritual temptations come through falsities breaking into the thoughts, which is the source of remorse of conscience and grief of mind and spirit, these are signified by "the wind of the tempest stood, and He raised up its waves on high;" deliverance from them is signified by "He made the tempest to stand still, that the waves might be hushed."</p><p>[24] The same is signified by these words in Mark:<p>There arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now filling. But Jesus was in the stern, slumbering on a pillow; and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Carest Thou not that we perish? And He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Be still, be dumb. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_4_37.htm">Mark 4:37-39</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>As they sailed Jesus fell asleep; and there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filling <sup>3</sup>[with water], and were in danger; and coming to Him they awoke Him, saying, Master, Master, we perish. And having awakened, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the sea; and they ceased, and there was a calm (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_23.htm">Luke 8:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_24.htm">24</a>).<p>This miracle of the Lord, like all the rest, involves arcana of heaven and interior things of the church. The difference between Divine miracles and those not Divine is that Divine miracles also signify Divine things, because the Divine is in them, while miracles not Divine signify nothing, because there is nothing of the Divine within them; and moreover, in the description of the Divine miracles in the Word, and in every particular thereof, there is a spiritual sense. This miracle involves spiritual temptations; "a great storm of wind, so that the waves beat into the boat, and it was filling," signifies such temptations; and that when they were in extreme fear, "Jesus awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be still, be dumb; and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm," signifies deliverance from temptations. Moreover, every single word here contains a spiritual sense; but this is not the place to unfold it particularly, but only to note that the "storm" and "tempest of wind" signify temptations, for these are irruptions of falsities, or inundations of the mind by falsities. This, too, is plain from the rebuke of the wind and the waves, and from the words of the Lord to the sea, "Be still, be dumb," as if He were speaking to those things or those persons that induce temptations.</p><p>[25] Furthermore, the winds that spring up in the spiritual world appear to arise there from different quarters, some from the south, some from the north, and some from the east; those from the south disperse truths with such as are in falsities, and those from the east disperse goods with such as are in evils. The winds disperse these because the winds spring from a powerful and strong influx of the Divine through the heavens into the parts below, and where the influx enters it fills truths and goods, that is, it fills the minds and spirits of those who are in truths and goods with the Divine; therefore those, the interiors of whose mind and spirit consist merely of falsities and evils, while exteriorly truths are mixed with falsities and goods are mixed with evils, cannot endure such influx from the Divine, consequently they withdraw into their falsities and evils which they love, and reject the truths and goods, which they do not love except for the sake of self and appearance.</p><p>[26] This makes clear what effect is there produced by the wind coming from the east, which is called "the east wind," namely, that with the evil it disperses all the goods and truths which they presented in external form before the world, and all the truths which they talked about for the sake of appearances. This is why withering and drying up are ascribed to that wind, "withered" signifying where there is no good, and "dried up" where there is no truth, as can be seen from passages in the Word where that wind is mentioned. As in Ezekiel:<p>Behold the vine planted, when the east wind shall touch it, in drying up shall it not dry up? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_17_10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The vine was plucked up in Mine anger, she was cast down to the earth, and the east wind withered her fruit; and the rods of her strength were broken and withered (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_19_12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>Ephraim, fierce among his brethren; an east wind shall come, the wind of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up; he shall plunder the treasure of every vessel of desire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>).<p>In Jonah:<p>And it came to pass when the sun arose that God prepared a scorching east wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_4_8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>).</p><p>[27] Moreover, the east wind also destroys all things where the evil are, their lands, their habitations, and their treasures (as may be seen in the little work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>);<p>And that brought on the locusts (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_10_13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>);<p>It is called a hard wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>);<p>A wind that broke the ships of Tarshish (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_48_7.htm">Psalms 48:7</a>);<p>A wind that broke Tyre in the heart of the seas (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>);<p>And that scattered enemies (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "soul," for "nostrils."

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 419 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>419. "Ut non flaret ventus." - Quod significet ne laederentur boni, et (ne) mali ante diem rejicerentur, constat ex significatione "venti", quod sit Divinum procedens, quod est Divinum Bonum unitum Divino Vero; quare quod "non ventus flaret" significat quod remisse et leniter influeret: quod "ne flaret ventus super terram", significet ne laederentur boni, ac ne mali ante diem rejicerentur, est quia separationes bonorum a malis et rejectiones malorum in spirituali mundo fiunt per varios gradus remissionis et intensionis Divini procedentis a Domino ut Sole: quando hoc remisse influit, tunc separantur boni a malis; et cum intense, tunc rejiciuntur mali: causae sunt, cum Divinum a Domino remisse influit, tunc est tranquillum et serenum ubivis, in quo apparent omnes quales sunt quoad statum sui boni; tunc enim in luce sistuntur omnes; quare tunc qui in bono sunt ex origine spirituali separantur ab illis qui in bono sunt solum ex origine naturali, inspicit enim Dominus illos qui in spirituali bono sunt, et eos adducit, et sic separat. Qui in bono sunt ex origine spirituali, sunt illi de quibus in sequentibus dicitur quod "signati super frontibus", sunt enim spirituales et angeli caeli; at qui solum in bono sunt ex origine naturali, illi non boni sunt, quia non spirituales; bonum enim apparens apud illos est malum, quia spectat se et mundum pro fine; nam bonum in externa forma agunt propter sui gloriam, honorem et lucrum, et non propter bonum proximi; proinde bonum faciunt modo ut spectentur ab hominibus: hi qui mere naturales, sunt qui "non signati", et qui postea rejiciuntur. Cum autem Divinum a Domino intense influit, tunc bona quae apud malos dissipantur, quoniam in se non bona sunt sed mala, et mala non sustinent influxum Divini: inde fit quod externa apud illos claudantur; quibus clausis interiora aperiuntur, in quibus non nisi quam mala et inde falsa sunt; unde illis dolores, angores et cruciatus, propter quos se dejiciunt in inferna, ubi similia mala et falsa sunt.<p>[2] Quando influxus Divini intenditur, quod fit cum rejiciendi sunt mali, tunc inferius in mundo spirituali existit ventus fortiter flans, sicut tempestas et procella; hic ventus est qui in Verbo vocatur "ventus orientalis", de quo etiam in sequentibus: inde quoque dejectio malorum in Verbo describitur per ventos vehementes et impetuosos, per tempestates et procellas. Per "ventum Jehovae" significatur simile quod per "spiritum Jehovae", nam intelligitur ventus respirationis, qui etiam vocatur spiritus. Inde est quod in lingua Hebraea et in multis aliis linguis "spiritus" denominatur ex eadem voce ex qua "ventus": ex hac causa est, quod maxima pars hominum de spiritu et de spiritibus non aliam ideam ceperint quam sicut de vento, qualis est ventus respirationis; inde opiniones in orbe etiam erudito, quod spiritus et angeli sint sicut venti, in quibus solum est vitale cogitationis; haec etiam causa est quod pauci ex illis se persuaderi patiantur quod Spiritus et angeli sint homines, corpore, faciebus et sensoriis praediti sicut homines in tellure. Quod per "ventum" et "Spiritum", ubi de homine dicuntur, significetur vita veri, seu vita secundum vera aut praecepta Domini, est quia respiratio, quae est pulmonum, correspondet illi vitae, ac cor et ejus motus correspondet vitae boni. Sunt enim binae vitae, quae unum facient apud hominem, vita veri et vita boni; vita veri est vita intellectus hominis; vita autem boni est vita voluntatis ejus: in intellectu enim resident vera, quia haec faciunt intellectum; in voluntate autem resident bona, quia haec faciunt voluntatem. Simile significatur in Verbo per "animam et cor", quando utrumque nominatur.<p>[3] Ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per "ventum" et per "spiritum Jehovae", nempe Divinum Verum; ac per "quatuor ventos" Divinum Verum unitum Divino Bono. Quoniam per "ventum" intelligitur ventus seu spiritus respirationis, et per illum significatur Divinum Verum, ac vita spiritualis illis qui recipiunt id, ideo ille ventus etiam vocatur "halitus narium Jehovae", et quoque: "halitus oris", ac "respiratio"; ut constare potest a sequentibus his locis:<p>Apud Ezechielem,<p>"Vidi et super" ossibus aridis "nervi, et caro ascendit, et obducta est super illa cutis superius; spiritus tamen non in illis: tunc dixit ad me, Propheta super spiritu, propheta, fili hominis, et dic ad spiritum, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, A quatuor ventis veni, spiritus, et inspira in occisos hos ut vivant" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_419/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_8" target=_top>37:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_419/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_9" target=_top>9</a>):<p>quid per "ossa arida" ibi significatur, in mox praecedente articulo dictum est, nempe illi quibus non aliquid vitae spiritualis est, seu quibus non aliqua vita per Divinum Verum; ejus inspiratio a Domino significatur per "Propheta super spiritu, et dic ad Spiritum, A quatuor ventis veni, spiritus, et inspira in occisos hos ut vivant": quod hic per "spiritum" intelligatur spiritus respirationis, patet nervi enim, caro et cutis erant, sed adhuc non respiratio; quare dicitur, "Dic ad spiritum ut inspiret in illos": inde constare potest quod "spiritus" seu "ventus" ille significet vitam spiritualem.
