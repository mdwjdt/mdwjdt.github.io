<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 90</h4><p>90. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. That this signifies those who receive goods and truths from the Lord, is evident from the signification of the seven stars, as denoting all goods and truths from the Lord (concerning which, see above, n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>); and from the signification of angels, as being those in the heavens who are in similar correspondent good and truth with those who are in the church on earth, concerning which more will be said in what follows; and from the signification of seven churches, as denoting all who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, thus all who belong to the church (concerning which, see above, n. <a href="../ae/20.htm">20</a>). From these considerations taken together, it follows as a conclusion, that these words, "the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches," signify all those who receive goods and truths from the Lord. The reason why by angels are here signified those who are in similar correspondent good and truth in heaven with those who are in the church on earth, is, that the whole of heaven is distinguished into societies, and the societies are arranged in order according to the affections of good and truth, in general and in particular. These societies correspond to those on earth that are in similar affections of good and truth; these societies collectively are called angels, and each one is called an angel; a society also, when it is seen from afar, and when it is presented so as to be seen as one, is seen as one angel (as may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/62.htm">Heaven and Hell 62</a>, <a href="../hh/68.htm">68-72</a>). Moreover there is a universal correspondence of heaven with the church, or of the angels of heaven with the men of the church; by this correspondence heaven makes one with the church. From these considerations it is clear what is here signified by the angels of the seven churches, and in the following chapter by the angel of each church, where it is said, Write to the angel of the church of Ephesus, to the angel of the church of Smyrna, to the angel of the church of Pergamos, to the angel of the church of Thyatira, to the angel of the church in Sardis, to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, and to the angel of the church in Laodicea. It is quite clear that the command was not to write to angels, but to churches, thus to those who are in such good and truth from the Lord, who are described by each church, concerning whom we shall treat in the following pages. (That by an angel in the Word nothing else is meant but good and truth which are from the Lord with angels and men, will be more fully shown in the following pages; in the mean time the reader may consult what is said and shown concerning the heavens and the angelic societies, in the work, Heaven and Hell, since without some knowledge thence concerning those things, what is said in the following pages respecting angels can be but little understood; for knowledge must precede, in order that the understanding may be enlightened. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 90</h4><p>90. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, signifies those who receive goods and truths from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of the "seven stars," as being goods and truths, all from the Lord see above, n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>; also from the signification of "angels," as being those in the heavens who are in like correspondent good and truth with those in the church (of which more in what follows); also from the signification of "seven churches," as being all those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, thus all who are of the church (See above, n. <a href="../ae/20.htm">20</a>). From this taken together, it follows as a conclusion that by "the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches" are signified all who receive goods and truths from the Lord.<p>By "angels" are here signified those who in heaven are in like correspondent good and truth with those in the church, because the universal heaven is divided into societies, and the societies are arranged according to the affections of good and truth in general and in particular. These societies correspond to those on earth who are in like affections of good and truth. All these societies are called "angels," and each one is called an "angel;" and a society also when viewed from a distance, and when so presented as to be seen as a one, appears as a single angel (See in the work on <a href="../hh/62.htm">Heaven and Hell 62</a>, <a href="../hh/68.htm">68-72</a>). Moreover, there is a complete correspondence of heaven with the church, or of the angels of heaven with the men of the church; through this correspondence heaven makes a one with the church. From this it is clear what is here signified by the "angels of the seven churches," and in the following chapter by the "angel" of each church, where it is said, "Write to the angel of the Ephesian church," "to the angel of the church of the Smyrneans," "to the angel of the Pergmean church," "to the angel of the church of Thyatira," "to the angel of the church in Sardis," "to the angel of the Philadelphian church," and "to the angel of the Laodicean church;" the command evidently was to write, not to angels but to churches, that is, to those who are in such good and truth from the Lord and who are described by each church (of whom we shall treat in what follows). (That in the Word by "angel" nothing else is meant but good and truth which are from the Lord with angel and man, will be more fully shown in the following pages; in the meantime see what is shown concerning the heavens and the angelic societies in the work on Heaven and Hell, since without knowledge of these things from that source, what is said of angels in the following pages can be but little understood; for knowledge must precede if the understanding is to be illustrated.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 90 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>90. "Septem stellae angeli septem Ecclesiarum sunt." - Quod significet illos qui recipiunt bona et vera a Domino, constat a significatione "septem stellarum", quod sint bona et vera, omnia (a) Domino (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_72" target=_top>72</a>); ex significatione "angelorum", quod sint qui in simili correspondente bono et vero sunt in caelis cum illis qui in ecclesia (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "septem Ecclesiarum", quod sint omnes qui in veris ex bono seu in fide ex charitate sunt, ita omnes qui ab ecclesia (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_20" target=_top>20</a>); ex quibus simul ut conclusum sequitur, quod per "septem stellae angeli septem Ecclesiarum sunt" significentur omnes qui recipiunt bona et vera a Domino. Quod per "angelos" hic significentur illi qui in simili correspondente bono et vero sunt in caelo cum illis qui in ecclesia, est quia universum caelum in societates distinctum est, et societates ordinatae secundum affectiones boni et veri in genere et in specie; hae societates correspondent illis in terris qui in similibus affectionibus boni et veri sunt; omnes hae societates vocantur "angeli", et unaquaevis vocatur "angelus"; et quoque societas, cum apparet e longinquo et quando sistitur videnda ut unum, apparet ut unus angelus (videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_62" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 62</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_68" target=_top>68-72</a>). <p>Praeterea est correspondentia omnimoda caeli cum ecclesia, seu angelorum caeli cum hominibus ecclesiae; per hanc correspondentiam caelum cum ecclesia unum facit. Ex his patet quid hic significatur per "angelos septem Ecclesiarum", et in sequenti capite per "angelum" cujusvis ecclesiae, ubi dicitur, "Scribe Angelo Ephesinae Ecclesiae", "Angelo Smyrnaeorum Ecclesiae", "Angelo Pergamensis Ecclesiae", "Angelo Thyatirensis Ecclesiae", "Angelo Ecclesiae in Sardibus", "Angelo Philadelphiensis Ecclesiae", et "Angelo Laodicensis Ecclesiae": manifeste patet, quod non mandatum sit scribere angelis, sed ecclesiis; ita illis qui in tali bono et vero a Domino sunt, qui per unamquamvis ecclesiam describuntur (de quibus in sequentibus). <p>(Quod in Verbo per "angelum" non aliud intelligatur quam bonum et vervm quod a Domino apud angelum et hominem, plenius ostendetur in sequentibus; interea videantur quae in opere De Caelo et Inferno, De Caelis et De societatibus Angelicis, ostensa sunt; quoniam absque cognitione de illis inde, plurum intelligi potest quid in sequentibus de angelis dicetur; cognitio enim praecedet, ut intellectus possit in illustratione esse.) </p>
