<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 823</h4><p>823. Verses 13, 14. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down out of heaven on the earth before men. And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which hath the stroke of a sword, and did live.<p>"And he doeth great wonders," signifies testifications and persuasions; "so that he maketh fire come down out of heaven on the earth before men," signifies the love of falsity from evil, arising from the conceit of man's own intelligence, as if it were the love of truth from good which is from the heavens in the church.<p>"And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast," signifies the persuasion of those who are in the church, by testifications from the Word joined to reasonings from the natural man; "saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast," signifies an ordinance appointed, that such things should be fully taught and believed by all in the church; "which hath the stroke of a sword, and did live," signifies the quality of those natural things which united those things that they took from the natural sense of the Word for the purpose of confirmation. </p>

"And he doeth great signs," signifies testifications and persuasions n. <a href="../ae/824.htm">824</a>; "so that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men," signifies the love of falsity from evil arising from the pride of self-intelligence as if it were the love of truth from good which is in the church from the heavens n. <a href="../ae/825.htm">825</a>.<p>14.
