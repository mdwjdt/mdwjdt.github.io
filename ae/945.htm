<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 945</h4><p>945. Wherefore all nations shall come and worship before thee. That this signifies that all who are in the good of love, and in the truths therefrom, shall acknowledge His Divine, is evident from the signification of nations, as denoting those who are in the good of love, and in the truths therefrom (concerning which see (n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>); and from the signification of worshipping, as denoting to acknowledge in heart, and to worship; see above (n. <a href="../ae/795.htm">795</a>, <a href="../ae/805.htm">805</a>, <a href="../ae/821.htm">821</a>). That by all nations such persons only are meant is evident; for there are also those who will not acknowledge the Lord.<p>Continuation:-<p>When a man is in that state, then he is raised up from his proprium. For a man is in his proprium when he is only in the natural external, but he is raised up from the proprium when he is in the spiritual internal. This elevation is not perceived by him, except from this, that he does not think evils, and that he turns away from thinking them, and that he is delighted with truths, and also with good uses. Such a man, however, if he advances further into that state, perceives influx in a kind of thought; but still he is not withheld from thinking and willing as of himself. For this the Lord wills for the sake of his reformation; but still he ought to acknowledge that nothing of good or of the truth therefrom is from himself, but from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 945</h4><p>945. Wherefore all the nations shall come and worship before Thee, signifies that all who are in the good of love and in truths therefrom will acknowledge His Divine. This is evident from the signification of "nations," as being those who are in the good of love and in truths therefrom (See n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>); also from the signification of "worship" [adorare] as being to acknowledge in heart and to worship [colere] (<a href="../ae/790.htm">790</a>, <a href="../ae/805.htm">805</a>, <a href="../ae/821.htm">821</a>). It is evident that such only are meant by "all nations," for there are also those who will not acknowledge the Lord.<p>When a man is in that state he is raised up from what is his own (proprium) for a man is in what is his own [proprium] when he is only in the natural external, but he is raised up from what is his own [proprium when he is in the spiritual internal. This raising up from what is his own man perceives only by this, that he does not think evils, and that he turns away from thinking them, and takes delight in truths and in good uses. And yet if such a man advances further into that state he perceives influx by a kind of thought; but he is not withheld from thinking and willing as if from himself, for this the Lord wills for the sake of reformation. Nevertheless, man should acknowledge that nothing of good or of truth therefrom is from himself, but all is from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 945 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>945. "Quare omnes gentes venient et adorabunt coram Te." - Quod significet quod omnes qui in bono amoris et inde veris sunt, agnituri sint Divinum Ipsius, constat ex significatione "gentium", quod sint qui in bono amoris et inde veris sunt (de qua [supra,] n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_945/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_175" target=_top>175</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_945/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_331" target=_top>331</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_945/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_625" target=_top>625</a>); et ex significatione "adorare", quod sit agnoscere corde et colere (de qua (supra,] n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_945/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_790" target=_top>790</a> [a] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_945/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_805" target=_top>805</a> [a] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_945/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_821" target=_top>821</a> [a]): quod per "omnes gentes" illi solum intelligantur, patet; nam etiam sunt qui non agnituri sunt Dominum.<p>(Continuatio.)<p>Quando homo in eo statu est, tunc elevatus est a suo proprio: homo enim in suo proprio cum solum in externo naturali est; at elevatus a proprio est cum in interno spirituali. Quod a proprio elevatus sit non sentit homo, nisi ex eo, quod non cogitet mala, et quod aversetur cogitare illa, et quod delectetur veris, ac usibus bonis; is tamen homo, si ulterius in illum statum progreditur, percipit aliqua cogitatione influxum, sed usque non detinetur a cogitare et velle sicut a se, hoc enim vult Dominus propter reformationem: agnoscet tamen quod nihil boni et inde veri sit ex se, sed ex Domino. </p>
