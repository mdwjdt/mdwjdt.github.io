<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 43</h4><p>43. The Almighty. That this signifies from Himself, is evident from the fact that no one has any power in the heavens but the Lord alone; therefore the angels are powerful, or have as much power as they have receptivity of power from the Lord, and their receptivity is according to the degree in which they are in Divine good united with Divine truth; for this is the Lord in heaven. It is therefore evident that the Lord alone is powerful, and no one in heaven is ever powerful but from the Lord; the reason being that the Divine of the Lord is the All in all in heaven; for this makes heaven in general, and with each one in particular. By Him also were all things created which were created, thus heaven and earth, as He Himself also teaches in John:<p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>By the Word is meant the Divine truth in the heavens, from which all things there exist. That the same is the Lord as to the Divine Human is evident, because it is said, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." And because all the life of the angels is also from Him, and all light in the heavens, it is said, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men. (All these things may be seen more fully illustrated in the work, Heaven and Hell, viz., that the Divine of the Lord makes heaven, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>)<p>and that no other has life in himself, is plain from the words of Jesus,<p>"Without me ye can do nothing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 43</h4><p>43. The Almighty, signifies from Himself. This is evident from this, that no one except the Lord alone has any power in the heavens; therefore the angels are powers, or are powerful, in the measure of their reception from the Lord, and they receive in the measure in which they are in Divine good united with Divine truth; for this is the Lord in Heaven. From this it is clear that the Lord alone is powerful, and no one else in heaven except from the Lord. The reason is that the Divine of the Lord is the All in all things in heaven, for this makes heaven in general, and with each one in particular. Moreover, by Him were all things created that were created, thus heaven and earth, as He Himself teaches in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made through Him; and without Him was not anything made that hath been made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_3.htm">3-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>By "the Word" is meant the Divine truth which is in the heavens, and from which are all things there. That this is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human is evident, for it is said, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us." And because all the life of the angels is therefrom, likewise all the light in the heavens, it is said, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men." (But all these things may be seen more fully illustrated in the work on Heaven and Hell, namely, that the Divine of the Lord makes heaven, n <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>);<p>and that no one else has life in himself Jesus declares:<p>Without Me ye can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 43 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>43. "Qui omnipotens." - Quod significet ex Se, constat ex eo, quod nulli aliqua potentia sit in caelis quam soli Domino; quare angeli tantum potentiae sunt, seu tantum potentes, quantum a Domino accipiunt; et tantum accipiunt quantum in Divino Bono unito Divino Vero sunt, nam hoc est Dominus in caelo. Inde patet quod solus Dominus sit potens, et nusquam aliquis in caelo quam a Domino. Causa est, quia Divinum Domini est omne in omnibus ibi, facit enim caelum in communi, et apud unumquemvis in particulari. Sunt etiam omnia ab Ipso creata quae creata sunt, ita caelum et terra, quod etiam Ipse docet apud Johannem:<p>"In principio erat Verbum, ac Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum Omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est. In Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum Et Verbum Caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis" ( <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>).<p>Per "Verbum" intelligitur Divinum Verum quod in caelis a quo omnia ibi sunt. Quod illud sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, patet, quia dicitur, "Et Verbum Caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis"; et quia omnis angelorum vita inde est, et quoque omnis lux in caelis inde est, dicitur, "In Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum." (Sed haec omnia melius illustrata videantur in opere De Caelo et Inferno; quod nempe Divinum Domini faciat caelum, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_7" target=_top>7-12</a>; quod hoc sit Divinum Humanum Ipsius, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_78" target=_top>78-86</a>; quod inde omnis vita angelis, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_9" target=_top>9</a>; et quoque omnis lux caeli, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_126" target=_top>126-140</a>; quod omnis potentia angelis sit ex Domino, et nulla a se ipsis, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_228" target=_top>228-233</a>. Ex his patet, quod omnipotens sit ex se esse, vivere, et posse.) Quod Divinum Humanum Domini aeque ex Se sit, vivat, et possit, ac Divinum Ipsius in Ipso, quod "Pater" vocatur, etiam docet Dominus:<p>"Quemadmodum Pater habet vitam in Se Ipso, ita dedit Filio habere vitam in Se Ipso" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_26" target=_top>Johannes 5:26</a>);<p>et quod nemo alius vitam habeat in se ipso:<p>Jesus dixit, "sine Me non potestis facere quicquam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_5" target=_top>Johannes 15:5</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
