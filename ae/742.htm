<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 742</h4><p>742. He was cast out unto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.- That this signifies that those evils and the falsities therefrom were condemned to hell, is evident from the signification of being cast out unto the earth, as denoting to be separated from heaven and to be condemned to hell (concerning which we shall speak presently); and from the signification of the angels of the dragon, as denoting falsities from evil, which evil is signified by the dragon. For the angels of heaven, in the Word, signify Divine Truths, because they are recipients of them, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>). The angels of the dragon therefore signify the infernal falsities which go forth from the evil signified by the dragon; those falsities are for the most part truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities, as we have said above.</p><p>[2] To be cast out unto the earth, means to be condemned to hell, because this is signified when the expression "to cast out of heaven" is used.<p>In the spiritual world there are lands (terroe) as in the natural world, full of mountains and hills, and also of valleys and rivers, and when these are collectively called the earth, then the earth signifies the church; but when the lowest parts of the earth are meant, as is the case when the expression "to be cast out from heaven unto the earth" is used, then the earth signifies what is damned, because under those lowest parts are the hells, and also in the hells there are lands, but such as are damned. For this reason no angel goes about with head bent forward, bowed down or looking on the earth, much less does he lie upon the earth in its lowest parts, or take up any of its dust. It arises from this, that those who in the world had condemned others to hell, are accustomed to cast dust taken from that earth upon another, for this corresponds to such condemnation. Moreover, no one is allowed to walk with naked feet upon those lands (terroe) in the spiritual world. The lands (terroe) there that are damned are readily distinguished from those that are not damned, because the land that is damned is utterly barren and mere dust, and is here and there covered with thorns and briars, while the land that is not damned is fertile, full of herbs, shrubs, trees, and cultivated fields. It was therefore a customary rite in the Jewish representative church to cast themselves to the earth, to roll themselves upon it, and to sprinkle dust from it upon their heads, when they were in great grief on account of defeat by their enemies, and on account of violence offered to their sanctuaries. By these actions they represented that they acknowledged themselves to be of themselves accursed, thus in this most humble posture they begged that their sins might be forgiven. That those who are meant by the dragon and his angels were separated from heaven and condemned to hell, while the Last Judgment was being performed, and also afterwards, I was permitted to see, as an eye-witness; upon this fact more will be said at the end of this work. From these things it is evident that to be cast out of heaven unto the earth signifies to be condemned to hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 742</h4><p>742. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him, signifies that those evils and the falsities thence were condemned to hell. This is evident from the signification of "cast out into the earth," as being to be separated from heaven and to be condemned to hell (of which presently); also from the signification of the dragon's "angels," as being falsities from the evil that is signified by "the dragon;" for "the angels of heaven" signify in the Word Divine truths because they are recipients of them (See above, n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>); therefore the dragon's "angels" signify the infernal falsities that proceed from the evil that is signified by "the dragon." The falsities signified by the dragon's "angels" are for the most part truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities, as has been said above.</p><p>[2] "To be cast out into the earth" means to be condemned to hell, because this is signified by the expression "to be cast out of heaven." In the spiritual world there are lands as in the natural world, full of mountains and hills, likewise of valleys and rivers; when these taken together are called the earth, then the "earth" signifies the church; but when the lowest parts of the earth are meant, as is meant in the expression "to be cast out of heaven into the earth," then the "earth" signifies what is condemned, because under those lowest parts are the hells, and in the hells also there are lands, but such as are condemned. For this reason no angel goes about ordinarily with his head bent forward or bowed down or looking to the earth, still less lying upon it in its lowest parts, or taking up any of its dust. From this it comes that those who condemned others to hell in the world are wont to take the dust of that earth and to cast it upon another, because this corresponds to such condemnation. Furthermore, no one is permitted to walk with naked feet upon those lands. The earths (or lands) there that are condemned are easily distinguished from those that are not condemned, because the condemned land is utterly barren and mere dust, and is here and there covered with thorns and briars, while the land not condemned is fertile and full of herbs, shrubs, trees, and also fields.</p><p>[3] From this came the established rite in the Jewish representative church to cast themselves to the earth, to roll themselves upon it, and to sprinkle dust from it upon their heads, when they were in great grief on account of defeat by enemies or violence offered to their sanctuaries; and by this they represented that they acknowledged themselves to be of themselves condemned; thus by this most humble gesture they begged that their sins might be forgiven. That those meant by "the dragon and his angels" were separated from heaven and condemned to hell while the Last Judgment was executed and afterwards, it was granted me to see as an eyewitness, about which more will be told at the end of this work. From this it can be seen that "to be cast out of heaven into the earth" signifies to be condemned to hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 742 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>742. "Prejectus est in terram, et angeli ejus cum illo projecti sunt." - Quod significet quod mala illa et falsa inde damnata sint inferno, constat ex significatione "projici in terram", quod sit separari a caelo, ac damnari inferno (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "angelorum draconis", quod sint falsa [ex] malo, quod per "draconem" significatur; per "angelos caeli" enim in Verbo significantur Divina vera, quia sunt receptiones eorum (videatur supra, n <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_742/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_130" target=_top>130</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_742/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_302" target=_top>302</a>); inde per "angelos draconis" significantur infernalia falsa quae ex malo, quod per "draconem" significatur, procedunt: falsa illa, quae per "angelos draconis" significantur, sunt pleraque vera falsificata, quae in se sunt falsa, ut supra dictum est.<p>[2] Quod "projici in terram" sit damnari inferno, est quia hoc significatur cum dicitur "projici e caelo." Sunt in mundo spirituali terrae sicut in mundo naturali, plenae montibus et collibus, tum vallibus, ut et fluminibus; cum haec simul sumpta vocantur terra, tunc per "terram" significatur ecclesia; at cum ima terrae intelliguntur, sicut intelligitur per "projici e caelo in terram", tunc per "terram" significatur damnatum; quia sub imis illis sunt inferna, et quoque in infernis sunt terrae, sed terrae damnatae. Ex hac causa est quod nulli angelo mos sit prone seu nutante capite ire, et spectare terram, immo nec super terra in imis ejus jacere, nec aliquod pulveris inde desumere. Inde venit, quod qui in mundo damnaverunt alios inferno, soleant pulverem e terra illa desumptum projicere in alterum, nam hoc correspondet condemnationi illi; immo nec licet alicui nudis pedibus super terris illis ambulare. Illae terrae, quae damnatae sunt, internoscuntur probe a terris quae non damnatae sunt, ex eo, quod terra damnata sit prorsus sterilis et modo pulvis, ac hinc et inde spinis et sentibus obsita; at terra non damnata est fecunda, plena herbis, virgultis, arbori bus et quoque agris.<p>[3] Inde ritus in Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica solennis fuit, se projicere in terram, se volutare ibi, ac inde pulverem super caput spargere, quando in magno luctu propter clades ab hostibus, ac propter violentiam illatam sanctuariis illorum, fuerunt; per quae repraesentant quod agnoscerent se ex semet damnatos esse; sic humillimo gestu sollicitantes ut remitterentur illis peccata eorum. Quod illi qui per "draconem" et per "angelos ejus" intelliguntur, separati fuerint e caelo, ac damnati inferno, dum ultimum judicium peragebatur, et quoque postea, mihi datum est oculo teste videre, de qua re tamen ad finem hujus operis plura dicentur. Ex his constare potest quod per "projici e caelo in terram" significetur damnari inferno. </p>
