<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 628</h4><p>628. And the angel stood near, saying.- That this signifies the will of the Lord, and command, is evident from the signification of standing near, which here denotes the will, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of angel, as denoting the Lord as to the Word, as shown above (n. <a href="../ae/593.htm">593</a>); and from the signification of saying, when from the Lord, as denoting command, for that which the Lord says is to come to pass, or must be done by any one, is command. The reason why the angel standing near denotes in this passage the will of the Lord, is, that in the spiritual world, thought with the desire and will to see another, to speak with him, and give him a command, causes the other to be present, that is, to stand near. For in that world distances are not fixed and therefore measurable, as in the natural world; but similitude of affection, and of thought thence, causes presence, while their dissimilitude causes absence; all distances in that world have this origin. The basis of this fact is the universal law that the Lord is present with every one according to his love for Him, and according to his love towards the neighbour, and the thoughts therefrom. From this universal principle all distances, that is, presence and absence, among angels and spirits exist. When, therefore, any one desires to speak with another, that is to say, when he thinks about him, from a desire or will to speak with him, that other becomes immediately present, or he himself is present with him. That this is the case, may also be seen in <a href="../hh/191.htm">Heaven and Hell 191-199</a>), where space in heaven is treated of. From these things it is now evident why the angel standing near signifies the will of the Lord; for to stand near is to be present. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 628</h4><p>628. And the angel stood near, saying, signifies the Lord's will and command. This is evident from the signification of "to stand near," as being here will (of which presently); also from the signification of "angel," as being the Lord in respect to the Word (See above, n. <a href="../ae/593.htm">593</a>); also from the signification of "saying," as being, when the Lord speaks, command; for what the Lord says is to be done, or that anyone should do it, is a command. "The angel stood near" means here the Lord's will, because in the spiritual world the thought, with the purpose, and will to see another, to speak with him, and to give him a command, causes the other to be present, that is, to stand near; for in that world there are no distances that are constant and thence measurable, as in the natural world; but likeness of affection and of thought thence causes presence, and unlikeness of these causes absence; this is the origin of all distances in that world. This comes from the universal principle that the Lord is present with all according to their love to Him and according to their love towards the neighbor and thoughts from these. From this universal principle all distances, that is, all presence and absence among angels and spirits, exist; therefore when anyone desires to speak with another, that is, thinks about him from a purpose or wish to speak with him, that one immediately becomes present, or he is present with that one. (That this is so can be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, <a href="../hh/191.htm">n. 191-199</a>, where Space in Heaven is treated of.) From this it can now be seen why the Lord's will is signified by "the angel stood near," for "to stand near" means to be present. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 628 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>628. "Et angelus adstitit dicens." - Quod significet voluntatem Domini et mandatum, constat ex significatione "adstare", quod hic sit voluntas (de qua sequitur); ex significatione "angeli", quod sit Dominus quoad Verbum (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_628/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_593" target=_top>593</a>); et ex significatione "dicere", cum a Domino, quod sit mandatum; nam quod Dominus dicit, ut fiat, aut ut aliquis faciat, est mandatum. <p>Quod "adstitit angelus" hic sit voluntas Domini, est quia in mundo spirituali cogitatio cum intentione et voluntate videndi alterum, loquendi cum illo, et mandatum ei dandi, facit ut praesens sit, hoc est, ut adstet; in illo enim mundo non sunt distantiae quae constantes et inde mensurabiles sicut in mundo naturali, sed similitudo affectionis et inde cogitationis facit praesentiam, ac dissimilitudo earum facit absentiam; ex illa origine sunt omnes distantiae in illo mundo: hoc venit ex hoc universali, quod Dominus praesens sit apud omnes secundum eorum amorem in Ipsum, et secundum amorem erga proximum, et inde cogitationes; ex hoc universali principio existunt omnes distantiae, hoc est, praesentiae et absentiae, inter angelos et spiritus; quare cum aliquis desiderat loqui cum altero, hoc est, cogitat de illo ex intentione seu voluntate loquendi cum illo, fit is illico praesens, seu ipse praesens apud eum: (quod ita sit, videri etiam potest in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_628/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_191" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 191-199</a>, ubi actum est De Spatio in Caelo): ex his nunc constare potest unde est quod "adstitit angelus" significet voluntatem Domini; "adstare" enim est praesens esse. </p><p> </p>
