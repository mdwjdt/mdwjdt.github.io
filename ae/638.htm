<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 638</h4><p>638. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands.- That this signifies the good of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbour, and the truth of doctrine and of faith, from which are heaven and the church, is evident from the signification of an olive garden, olive tree, and olive, as denoting, in a broad sense (in lato sensu), the celestial kingdom of the Lord and thence the celestial church, which differs from other churches in this, that those who form that church are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbour; for this reason, by an olive tree and the olive each of those loves, or the good of each love, is signified - that the olive tree and the olive signify that church or those goods of the church will be evident from what follows - and from the signification of a lampstand, as denoting, in a broad sense, the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, and thence the spiritual church; and because the chief thing of that church is the truth of doctrine and the truth of faith, therefore these also are meant by the lampstands. That a lampstand has this signification in the spiritual sense may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/62.htm">62</a>).</p><p>[2] It is said that the two witnesses are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands (which are however four), because two signifies conjunction and thence one. For there are two things that make one - good and truth. Good is not good unless from truth, and truth is not truth unless from good; when therefore those two make one, then they first are and exist. This conjunction into one is called the heavenly marriage, and from that marriage are heaven and the church. It is similar in regard to celestial good, signified by the two olive trees, and spiritual good, signified by the two lampstands. For the good in the celestial kingdom of the Lord is the good of love to the Lord, and the truth of that good is called the good of love towards a brother and companion; while the good in the spiritual kingdom of the Lord is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and the truth of that good is called the good of faith. But it is difficult to form a just idea of these things, unless the quality of celestial good and the quality of spiritual good are known, and the difference between them. From these considerations the reason is evident why the two witnesses are called two olive trees and two lampstands. That two signifies conjunction into one, or the heavenly marriage, may be seen above (n. 532, at end).</p><p>[3] The reason why the olive tree signifies the celestial church, is, that trees in general signify perceptions and knowledges (cognitiones), and every church is a church from its knowledges of truth and good, and according to the perception of them; and because oil signifies the good of love, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>), therefore an olive garden and an olive tree signify the church in which that good reigns. There are three trees which chiefly signify the church - the olive, the vine, and the fig, the olive signifying the celestial church, the vine the spiritual church, and the fig tree the external celestial and spiritual church.</p><p>[4] That such things as are here described are signified by the two olive trees and the two lampstands, any one may see and conclude from this, that they are called witnesses, and thus are those things that bear witness concerning the Lord, or, acknowledge and confess Him; also from the fact that it is afterwards said concerning them, that the beast slew them, and afterwards that the spirit of life from God entered into them. This could not be said of olive trees and candlesticks, unless they signified such things as the angels of heaven and the men of the church possess from the Lord, and which bear witness concerning the Lord, or cause angels and men to bear witness concerning Him. For angels and men cannot bear witness from themselves concerning the Lord, but the good and the truth which they have from the Lord do this, that is to say, the Lord Himself, from His own good and truth in them, bears witness of Himself.</p><p>[5] In many places in the Word mention is frequently made of gardens and woods, of olive gardens and vineyards, also of trees of various kinds, as the olive, the vine, the fig, the cedar, the poplar, and the oak; but no one hitherto has known that each of them signifies something spiritual pertaining to heaven and the church - with the exception that a vineyard signifies the church. But not only does a vineyard signify the church, but also an olive garden; also the forest of cedar or Lebanon. In fact the same is the case also with the trees, as the olive, the vine, the fig, the cedar; and it is because they signify the church, and the spiritual things which belong to it, that they are so often mentioned in the Word.<p>In regard to gardens and forests the case is this, that gardens or paradises signify specially the intelligence and wisdom which pertains to the men of the church, while forests or groves signify the intelligence of the natural man, which, considered in itself, is knowledge serviceable to the intelligence of the spiritual man; but the olive garden and vineyard signify the church, the olive garden the celestial church, or the church which is in the good of love to the Lord, and the vineyard the spiritual church, or the church which is in the good of charity towards the neighbour, and thence in the truths of faith. The olive and the vine have a similar signification, because oil signifies the good of love to the Lord, and wine (vinum) the good of charity towards the neighbour and the good of faith; but the fig tree signifies each church both the celestial and the spiritual, but external.</p><p>[6] These things have such significations from representatives in the spiritual world, thus from correspondence. For in the inmost heaven, where the celestial kingdom of the Lord is, and where love to the Lord reigns, olive gardens and fig trees form the paradises and forests; but in the second heaven they consist of vineyards, and various kinds of fruit-bearing trees; similarly in the ultimate heaven, but with this difference, that in this heaven the trees are not so noble. Such things exist in the heavens, because they correspond to the wisdom, intelligence, love, charity, and faith of the angels who are in those heavens. It is evident now from these things that the witnesses are called olive trees, because olive trees mean all those who form the celestial church of the Lord, or who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in the good of brotherly and social love.</p><p>[7] The signification of olive gardens, olive trees, and olives, in the Word, is evident from the following passages.<p>In Zechariah:<p>"Two olive trees by" the lampstand, "one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side thereof; and two berries of olives; these are the two sons of the olive tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_3.htm">4:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_14.htm">14</a>).<p>The subject treated of here is the foundation of the house or temple by Zerubbabel; and by the house or temple is signified the church, therefore a lampstand was seen by the prophet, and near it two olive trees, almost similar to what was seen by John in the Apocalypse. By the two olive trees and the olive berries are signified celestial goods, which are the goods of love to the Lord and of brotherly and social love; the former good is signified by the olive tree seen near the right hand of the bowl, and the latter by the olive tree at the left; the truths of this good are meant by the sons of the olive tree standing near the Lord of the whole earth, to stand near Him denoting to be and exist from Him.</p><p>[8] Since olive trees signified those goods, therefore the cherubim in the midst of the house or temple were made of olive wood, also the doors to the adytum (or oracle), and the posts (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-33</a>). For the cherubim, like the doors and posts to the adytum of the temple, signified protection lest the Lord should be approached except by the good of love. The adytum (or oracle) signified where the Lord is, and olive wood the good of love, because an olive garden, an olive tree, and an olive denote the celestial things of love.</p><p>[9] Because an olive garden and an olive tree signify the church which is in love to the Lord, therefore the oil of holiness, with which all of the holy things of the church were anointed, was made from the oil of olive, and aromatics mixed with it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_24.htm">24</a>). For in the measure that every thing pertaining to the church is derived from love to the Lord, so far is it holy and Divine; therefore by means of that oil a representative of the Lord, of heaven and of the church was formed. These things are explained in the Arcana Coelestia.</p><p>[10] For the same reason, pure oil of the olive was beaten for the luminary in the tent of meeting, which was lit every evening (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>). By that luminary or lampstand is there signified the spiritual church of the Lord, and the fire kindled in the lamps signified spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbour; the oil of the olive pure and beaten which was the source of the fire has a similar signification. See what is said concerning this in the Arcana Coelestia, in its proper place.</p><p>[11] That the olive tree and olive signify the good of love is also evident from the following passages.<p>In Hosea:<p>"I will be as the dew to Israel, he shall blossom as the lily, and he shall strike his roots as Lebanon; his branches shall spread, and his honour shall be as of the olive, and his odour as of Lebanon" (<a href="../ae/288.htm">288</a>, <a href="../ae/345.htm">345</a>). And the sixth state, which is a state of intelligence and wisdom, is signified by his odour being to him as of Lebanon, odour denoting perception, and Lebanon rationality, from which are intelligence and wisdom.</p><p>[12] And in David:<p>"I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God to an age and for ever" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_52_8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>).<p>It is said, "like a green olive tree in the house of God," because the green olive signifies the good of love, springing up by means of the truth of the Word; and the house of God signifies the church.</p><p>[13] Again:<p>"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the sides of thy house, thy sons as olive plants round about thy tables; thus shall the man be blessed that feareth Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_128_3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_128_4.htm">4</a>).<p>By these words, in the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, are meant a wife and sons, and the delights arising from marriage and prolification, but in the internal sense, which is the sense of the spirit of the Word, by wife is signified the affection for truth, and by sons, the truths themselves that spring from it. For all truth, in which there is life, is born from the affection for truth; and since by wife is signified that affection, she is compared to a fruitful vine, because a vine signifies the church, and a fruitful vine, the church as to the affection for truth. By the house is signified the spiritual mind, and by its sides are signified every thing in the natural man. By sons are signified the truths which are born from that spiritual affection, these being compared to olive plants, because by means of truths the goods of love and charity are produced, which are denoted by olives. By round about the tables are signified the delights arising from spiritual appropriation and nourishment.</p><p>[14] And in Moses:<p>"It shall come to pass when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land, he shall give thee great and good cities which thou buildedst not, and houses full of every good which thou filledst not, and hewn cisterns which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-yards which thou plantedst not" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_11.htm">11</a>).<p>The meaning of these words, in the spiritual sense, is altogether different from what it is in the historical sense. For in the spiritual sense by the land of Canaan, into which they were to be brought, is signified the church, therefore cities, houses, cisterns, vineyards, and olive gardens, signify such things as pertain to the church; great and good cities signify doctrinals, which teach the goods of love and of charity; houses full of every good signify all things pertaining to wisdom; hewn out cisterns signify every thing of intelligence in the natural man, which are cognitions and knowledges (scientiae), and vineyards and olive-yards signify every thing pertaining to the church as to truths and goods.</p><p>[15] It is related concerning Noah, that he sent out a dove from the ark, which returned to him about the time of evening, bearing the leaf of an olive plucked off in its mouth, and that so he knew that the waters were diminished (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/870.htm">Arcana Coelestia 870-892</a>).</p><p>[16] In Zechariah:<p>"In that day his feet shall stand upon the mount of Olives, which is before the faces of Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, and part thereof toward the rising and toward the sea with a very great valley; and part of the mountain shall recede toward the north, and part thereof toward the south" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">14:4</a>).<p>The signification of these things had been explained above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>); and upon that mountain he spake with his disciples concerning the last Judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>); and he went thence to Jerusalem and suffered, besides several other circumstances (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_30.htm">26:30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_1.htm">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_26.htm">14:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_29.htm">Luke 19:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_37.htm">37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>). All these things took place there, because the mount of Olives signified the Divine Love; and because things significative were representative of heaven and of the church, they at that time conjoined the Lord with heaven and the world. Also the angels of the inmost or third heaven dwell in the east, upon mountains, where olive trees flourish more than all other trees.</p><p>[17] In Jeremiah:<p>"Jehovah hath called thy name a green olive, fair of form with fruit; at the voice of a great tumult he hath kindled a fire upon it, and the branches thereof are broken; for Jehovah Zebaoth, who planted thee, hath spoken evil against thee, on account of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_16.htm">11:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_17.htm">17</a>).<p>Here, the house of Judah and of Israel is called a green olive, fair of form with fruit, because by the olive and its fruit is signified the good of love, and by green and fair in form is signified the truth of that good, from which comes intelligence; for the house of Judah signifies the church as to the good of love, and the house of Israel the church as to the truth of that good; to call the name signifies the quality thereof. The destruction and vastation of that church by the love of evil is described by Jehovah kindling a fire upon it and breaking its branches; the fire signifies the love of evil, and the branches signify truths, which are said to be broken when they perish by reason of that love. This is attributed to Jehovah, from the appearance that all evil of punishment seems to be from God, since He, being omnipotent, does not avert it; for it is not known that to avert the evil of punishment would be contrary to order. For, if evil were averted, it would increase until no good would remain.</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>"So shall it be in the midst of the land, in the midst of the peoples, as the beating of an olive tree, as grape-gleaning when the vintage is done" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_13.htm">24:13</a>).<p>These words also refer to the vastation of the church as to celestial good, and as to spiritual good. Celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is in its essence truth from that good; celestial good is signified by the olive, and spiritual good, which is truth from celestial good, is signified by the vintage; vastation is signified by the beating and the grape-gleanings after consummation.</p><p>[19] In Moses:<p>"Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt not drink the wine, because the worm shall devour it; thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil, because thine olive tree shall be shaken" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_28_39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_28_40.htm">40</a>).<p>A vineyard signifies the spiritual church, and the olive tree the celestial church, so a vineyard also signifies the truth of the church, and the olive tree its good; therefore by planting a vineyard and dressing it, and not drinking the wine (vinum), is signified that although the church may be established and the truths of doctrine taught, still truths will produce neither effect nor result, wine (vinum) denoting the truth of doctrine. Because the worm shall devour it signifies that falsities will destroy it; thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border signifies that there shall be the goods of love from the Lord by means of the Word, and preachings from the Word, in the whole church. But thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil signifies still not to enjoy any good, and thence any joy; for thine olive tree shall be shaken signifies that that good will perish; these things are said concerning the curse which would come upon them if other gods were worshipped, and if the statutes and the judgments were not kept.</p><p>[20] In Micah:<p>"Thou shalt tread the olive, but shalt not anoint thee with the oil; and the new wine (mustum), but thou shalt not drink the wine (vinum)" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_15.htm">6:15</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>"I have smitten with blasting and mildew the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards, and your fig trees and your olive trees the caterpillar hath eaten; yet have ye not returned unto me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_9.htm">4:9</a>).<p>By gardens are signified those things that pertain to spiritual intelligence; blasting and mildew signify evil and falsity in extremes, or from the corporeal-Sensual. Vineyards signify the spiritual or interior truths of the church, fig trees exterior goods and truths, which are also called moral; but olive trees signify the goods of the church, and the caterpillar signifies falsity destroying good.</p><p>[21] In Habakkuk:<p>"The fig tree shall not flourish, and there shall be no produce in the vines, the labour of the olive gardens shall fail, and the field shall yield no food" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_17.htm">3:17</a>).<p>By the fig tree here also are signified the external things of the church; by the vines, the internal things thereof; the olive garden signifies its goods, and the field, the church itself in man.</p><p>[22] In the First Book of Samuel:<p>The king "will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive gardens, and give them to his servants" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_8_14.htm">8:14</a>).<p>Here also fields, vineyards, and olive gardens have a similar signification, the subject treated of being the right of a king, by which the dominion of the natural man over the spiritual is there meant and described, which is such that it will destroy all the truths and goods of the church, and make them serve the natural man, and therefore evils and falsities.</p><p>[23] In the Book of Judges: Jotham said unto the citizens of Shechem, who had made Abimelech king,<p>"The trees went to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive, Reign thou over us; but the olive said to them, Shall I make my fatness to cease, which God and men honour in me, and go to move myself over the trees? And the trees said unto the fig tree, Come, reign thou over us; but the fig tree said unto them, Shall I make my sweetness to cease, and my good produce, and go to move myself over the trees? Then the trees said unto the vine, Come, reign thou over us; but the vine said unto them, Shall I cause my new wine to cease, that maketh glad God and man, and go to move myself over the trees? And all the trees said to the bramble, Come thou and reign over us; and the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me for a king over you, come and confide in my shade, but if not, let fire go out from the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_9_7.htm">9:7-15</a>).<p>These words of Jotham signify that the citizens of Shechem were not willing that celestial good, denoted by the olive, neither the truth of that good, denoted by the vine, nor moral good, which is external celestial and spiritual good, signified by the fig tree, should reign over them, but the evil of falsity, which appeared to them as good, denoted by the bramble, the fire from which denotes the evil of lust (concupiscentia). The cedars of Lebanon denote rational things from truths.</p><p>[24] It is evident from the passages above adduced that the olive tree and the vineyard, in many places, are named together, and this is the case because there is a marriage of good and truth in every detail of the Word; for by the olive tree and oil the good of the church is signified, and by the vineyard and wine (vinum) the truth of that good. Oil signifies the good of love and the delight of heaven thence, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>); and wine (vinum) signifies the good of charity and the truth of faith (n. <a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 638</h4><p>638. Verse 4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, signifies the good of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, and the truth of doctrine and of faith from which are heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of an "olive yard," "olive tree," and "olive," as being, in a broad sense, the Lord's celestial kingdom and thus the celestial church; which is distinguished from other churches in this, that those from whom that church exists are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor. This is why "olive tree" and "olive" signify each of these loves, that is, the good of each love. (That "olive tree" and "olive" signify that church, or those goods of the church, will be seen in what follows.) This is evident also from the signification of a "lampstand," as being in a broad sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and thus the spiritual church, and as the chief thing of that church is truth of doctrine and truth of faith, so these also are signified by the "lampstands." (That this is the meaning of a "lamp stand" in the spiritual sense, see above, n. <a href="../ae/62.htm">62</a>)</p><p>[2] It is said that "the two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands" (which yet are four), because "two" signifies conjunction and thence a one. For there are two things that make a one, namely, good and truth; good is not good except it be from truth, and truth is not truth except it be from good; consequently it is only when these two make a one that they have being and existence. This conjunction into one is called the heavenly marriage, and heaven and the church are from that marriage. It is similar with the celestial good, which is signified by "the two olive trees," and with the spiritual good, which is signified by "the two lampstands." For the good in the Lord's celestial kingdom is the good of love to the Lord, and the truth of that good is called the good of love towards a brother and companion; while the good in the Lord's spiritual kingdom is the good of charity towards the neighbor, and the truth of that good is called the good of faith. But a just idea of these things can scarcely be had unless it is known what celestial good is, and what spiritual good is, and what the difference between them is. This makes clear why it is that "the two witnesses" are called "two olive trees and two lampstands." (That "two" signifies conjunction into one, or the heavenly marriage, see above, n. <a href="../ae/532.htm">532</a>, at the end .)</p><p>[3] An "olive tree" signifies the celestial church, because "trees" in general signify perceptions and knowledges, and every church is a church from the knowledges of truth and good, and according to their perception; and "oil" signifies the good of love (See above, n. <a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>); so an "olive yard" and "olive tree" signify the church in which that good reigns. There are three trees that especially signify the church, namely, the "olive tree," the "vine," and the "fig tree," the "olive tree" signifying the celestial church, "the vine" the spiritual church, and the "fig tree" the external, celestial and spiritual church.</p><p>[4] That such is the signification of "the two olive trees and the two lampstands" anyone can see and conclude from this, that they are called "witnesses," and thus are what bear witness of the Lord, that is, acknowledge and confess Him; also from what is said of them in what follows, that "the beast killed them," and afterwards that "the spirit of life from God entered into them," which could not be said of olive trees and lampstands, unless these signified such things as are from the Lord with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church, and bear witness of the Lord, that is, cause angels and men to bear witness of Him. For angels and men cannot from themselves bear witness of the Lord, but the good and truth that are with them from the Lord do this, that is, the Lord Himself from His good and truth with them.</p><p>[5] In many passages in the Word gardens and forests, also olive yards and vineyards and also trees of many kinds, as the olive tree, the vine, the fig tree, the cedar, the poplar, and the oak are mentioned; but no one has known heretofore that each of these signifies something spiritual belonging to heaven and the church, except that a "vineyard" signifies the church; but not only does a "vineyard" signify the church but also an "olive yard," and a "forest of cedar" or "Lebanon," and even trees, such as the "olive tree," the "vine," the "fig tree," the "cedar;" and it is because these signify the church and the spiritual things belonging thereto that they are so often mentioned in the Word.</p><p>[6] In respect to gardens and forests: "gardens or paradises" signify in particular the intelligence and wisdom which the men of the church have; and "forests or groves" signify the intelligence of the natural man, which regarded in itself is knowledge serviceable to the intelligence of the spiritual man; but an "olive yard" and "vineyard" signify the church, "olive yard" the celestial church, or the church that is in the good of love to the Lord, and "vineyard" the spiritual church, or the church that is in the good of charity towards the neighbor, and thence in the truths of faith. The "olive" and "vine" have a like signification; and this because "oil" signifies the good of love to the Lord, and "wine" the good of charity towards the neighbor and the good of faith; while a "fig tree" signifies the church both celestial and spiritual, but external. These things have these significations from representatives in the spiritual world, and thus from correspondence; for in the inmost heaven, where the Lord's celestial kingdom is, and where love to the Lord reigns, the paradises and forests consist of olive yards and fig trees; but in the second heaven they consist of vineyards and many kinds of fruit bearing trees; in like manner in the lowest heaven, but with the difference that in this heaven the trees are not so noble. Such things exist in the heavens, because they correspond to the wisdom, intelligence, love, charity, and faith of the angels who are in those heavens. From this it can now be seen why "the witnesses" are called "olive trees," namely, because "olive trees" mean all who constitute the Lord's celestial church, that is, who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in the good of love towards a brother and companion.</p><p>[7] That such is the signification in the Word of "olive yards," "olive trees," and "olives," can be seen from the following passages. In Zechariah:<p>Two olive trees near the lampstand, one on the right side of the bowl and the other near its left side; and two olive berries; these are the two sons of the olive tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_3.htm">Zechariah 4:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_14.htm">14</a>).<p>This treats of the foundation of the house or temple by Zerubbabel; and the "house" or "temple" signifies the church, therefore a "lampstand" was seen by the prophet, and "near it two olive trees," almost the same as what was seen by John here in Revelation; and the "two olive trees" and "olive berries" signify celestial goods, which are the goods of love to the Lord and of love towards a brother and companion; the former good is signified by "the olive tree seen at the right side of the bowl," and the latter by "the olive tree seen near the left side." The truths of this good are meant by "the sons of the olive tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth," "to stand by Him" signifying to be and to exist from Him.</p><p>[8] Because these goods are signified by "olive trees":<p>The cherubim in the midst of the house or temple were made of olive wood, likewise the doors to the adytum, and the door posts (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-33</a>).<p>For the "cherubim," as well as the doors and posts to the adytum of the temple, signified the guard that there be no approach to the Lord except through the good of love; the "adytum" signified where the Lord is, and "olive wood" the good of love, because "the olive yard," "the olive tree," and "the olive" signify the celestial things that are of love.</p><p>[9] Because "the olive yard" and "the olive tree" signified a church that is in love to the Lord:<p>The oil of holiness with which all the holy things of the church were anointed was made of olive oil and spices mixed with it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_24.htm">24</a>).<p>For all things of the church are holy Divine things just so far as they are derived from love to the Lord; therefore by means of that oil a representation of the Lord and of heaven and the church was established. (See an explanation of these things in Arcana Coelestia.)</p><p>[10] For the same reason:<p>Pure olive oil was beaten for the light in the Tent of meeting, which was lighted up every evening (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>).<p>That "light" or the "lamp stand" there signified the Lord's spiritual church, and the "fire" kindled in the lamps signified spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor; the "pure olive oil beaten" from which was the fire has a similar signification (respecting which see Arcana Coelestia on that passage).</p><p>[11] That "olive tree" and "olive" signify the good of love is evident also from the following passages. In Hosea:<p>I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and he shall infix his roots as Lebanon; his branches shall spread; and his honor shall be as that of the olive, and his odor as that of Lebanon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_6.htm">6</a>).<p>This is said of the spiritual church, which is signified by "Israel;" "to be to him as the dew" signifies the existence and spiritual new birth of that church; the first state of its new birth or regeneration is signified by "he shall blossom as the lily," "lily" signifying the blossoming that precedes the fruit; the second state of regeneration is signified by "he shall infix his roots," which state is its existence in the natural, for there the roots are fixed; the third state is signified by "his branches shall spread," which signifies the multiplication of knowledges and of cognitions; the fifth <sup>1</sup>state, which is the state of fruit bearing, is signified by "his honor shall be as that of the olive," the "olive" signifying the good of love, of which "honor" is predicated (that "honor" is predicated of the good of love, see above, n. <a href="../ae/288.htm">288</a>, <a href="../ae/345.htm">345</a>); and the sixth <sup>2</sup>state, which is the state of intelligence and wisdom, is signified by "his odor as that of Lebanon," "odor" signifying perception, and "Lebanon" rationality, from which are intelligence and wisdom.</p><p>[12] In David:<p>I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God for an age and forever (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_52_8.htm">Psalms 52:8</a>).<p>It is said "like a green olive tree in the house of God," because a "green olive tree" signifies the good of love springing up by means of the truth of the Word; and the "house of God" signifies the church.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine on the sides of thy house; thy sons like olive plants around thy tables; thus shall the man be blessed that feareth Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_128_3.htm">Psalms 128:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_128_4.htm">4</a>).<p>In the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, this refers to a wife and sons, and the enjoyments arising from marriage and prolification, but in the internal sense, which is the sense of the spirit of the Word, "wife" signifies the affection of truth, and "sons" the truths themselves springing therefrom; for every truth in which there is life is born from the affection of truth; and because a "wife" signifies that affection she is compared to a fruitful vine, since a "vine" signifies the church, and a "fruitful vine" the church in respect to the affection of truth. A "house" signifies the spiritual mind, and its "sides" signify all things in the natural man; "sons" signify the truths that are born from that spiritual affection, and these are compared to "olive plants," because through truths the goods of love and charity, which are olive trees, are brought forth; "around the tables" signifies the enjoyments arising from spiritual appropriation and nourishment.</p><p>[14] In Moses:<p>It shall be when Jehovah thy God hath brought thee into the land, He shall give thee great and good cities which thou buildedst not, and houses full of every good thing which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive yards which thou plantedst not (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_11.htm">11</a>).<p>The meaning of these words in the spiritual sense is altogether different from their meaning in the historical sense; for in the spiritual sense "the land of Canaan," into which they were to be brought, signifies the church; therefore "cities," "houses," "cisterns," "vineyards," and "olive yards" signify such things as belong to the church; "great and good cities" signify the doctrinals, which teach the goods of love and charity; "houses full of every good thing" signify all things of wisdom; "cisterns hewn out" signify all things of intelligence in the natural man, which are cognitions and knowledges; "vineyards and olive yards" signify all things of the church in respect to truths and goods.</p><p>[15] It is related of Noah:<p>That he sent forth a dove out of the ark, which returned to him about the time of evening, bearing in its mouth the leaf of an olive plucked off, so that he knew that the waters were abated (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/870.htm">Arcana Coelestia 870-892</a>.)</p><p>[16] In Zechariah:<p>His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before the faces of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, a part thereof toward the east and toward the sea with a valley exceeding great, and a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and a part of it toward the south (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>).<p>What this signifies has been explained above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>);<p>That upon that mountain He spoke with His disciples about the Last Judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>, et seq.; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>, et seq.);<p>And that He went therefrom to Jerusalem and suffered; besides many other things (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_30.htm">26:30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_1.htm">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_26.htm">14:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_29.htm">Luke 19:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_37.htm">37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>).<p>All these things took place because "the Mount of Olives" signified the Divine love; and things significative, because they were representative of heaven and the church, were what at that time conjoined the Lord with heaven and the world. Moreover, the angels of the inmost or third heaven dwell in the east upon mountains, where olive trees abound more than all other trees.</p><p>[17] In Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah called thy name a green olive tree, beautiful with fruit of form; at the voice of a great tumult He hath kindled a fire upon it, and they have broken its branches; for Jehovah of Hosts, who planted thee, hath spoken evil against thee, because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_17.htm">17</a>).<p>Here the house of Judah and Israel is called "a green olive tree, beautiful with fruit of form," because "the olive tree" and its "fruit" signify the good of love, and "green" and "beautiful in form" signify the truth of that good, from which comes intelligence; for "the house of Judah" signifies the church in respect to the good of love, and "the house of Israel" the church in respect to the truth of that good; "to call its name" signifies its quality; the destruction and vastation of that church by the love of evil is described by "Jehovah hath kindled a fire upon it, and hath broken its branches," "fire" signifying the love of evil, and "branches" truths, which are said "to be broken" when they perish by reason of that love. This is attributed to Jehovah because of the appearance that all evil of punishment <sup>3</sup>seems to be from God, because He is omnipotent and does not avert it; for it is not known that to avert the evil of punishment would be contrary to order, for if it were averted evil would increase until there would be no good remaining.</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>So shall it be in the midst of the land, in the midst of the peoples, as the beating of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>).<p>This, too, is said of the vastation of the church in respect to celestial good, and in respect to spiritual good; celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is in its essence truth from that good; celestial good is signified by the "olive tree," and spiritual good which is the truth from celestial good is signified by the "vintage;" vastation is signified by the "beating" and "gleanings" after the consummation.</p><p>[19] In Moses:<p>Thou shalt plant vineyards and cultivate them, but the wine thou shalt not drink, for the worm shall devour it; thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil, because thy olive shall be shaken off (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_28_39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_28_40.htm">40</a>).<p>A "vineyard" signifies the spiritual church, and an "olive tree" the celestial church, so a "vineyard" signifies also the truth of the church, and an "olive tree" its good; therefore "to plant a vineyard and cultivate it and not drink the wine" signifies that although the church is established and truths of doctrine are taught, still truths will neither affect nor perfect, "wine" signifying the truth of doctrine; "for the worm shall devour it" signifies that falsities will destroy; "thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border" signifies that there will be the goods of love from the Lord through the Word and preachings from the Word throughout the church; "not to anoint with oil" signifies no enjoyment, nevertheless, of any good, or any joy therefrom; "thy olive shall be shaken off" signifies that that good will perish. This has reference to the curse if they should worship other gods, and should not keep the statutes and judgments.</p><p>[20] In Micah:<p>Thou shalt tread the olive but shalt not anoint thee with oil, and the new wine but thou shalt not drink wine (Mic. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_15.htm">Micah 6:15</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>I have smitten with blasting and mildew your many gardens and your vineyards; and the palmerworm hath devoured your fig trees and your olive trees; yet have ye not returned unto Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>).<p>"Gardens" signify such things as belong to spiritual intelligence; "blasting and mildew" signify evil and falsity in what is most external, or from the corporeal-sensual; "vineyards" signify the spiritual or interior truths of the church; "fig trees" exterior goods and truths, which are also called moral; but "olive trees" the goods of the church; and the "palmerworm" signifies falsity destroying good.</p><p>[21] In Habakkuk:<p>The fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall there be produce on the vines, the labor of the olive yard shall dissemble, and the field shall yield no food (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>).<p>Here, too, the "fig tree" signifies the externals of the church, "vines" its internals; the "olive yard" its goods; and the "field" the church itself with man.</p><p>[22] In the first book of Samuel:<p>The king shall take your fields and your vineyards and your olive yards, and shall give them to his servants (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_8_14.htm">1 Samuel 8:14</a>).<p>Here, too, "fields," "vineyards," and "olive yards" have the same signification. The right of the king is here treated of, by which is meant and described the dominion of the natural man over the spiritual, namely, that it will destroy all the truths and goods of the church, and make them serve the natural man, and thus evils and falsities.</p><p>[23] In the book of Judges:<p>Jotham said unto the citizens of Shechem, who had made Abimelech king, The trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. But the olive tree said unto them, Shall I make my fatness to cease, which God and men honor in me, and go to move myself over the trees? And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, reign over us. But the fig tree said unto them, Shall I make my sweetness to cease, and my good produce; and go to move myself over the trees? And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, reign over us. But the vine said unto them, Shall I cause my new wine to cease, that maketh glad God and men, and go to move myself over the trees? And all the trees said unto the thorn bush, Come thou, reign over us. And the thorn bush said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me for a king over you, come and put your trust in my shadow, but if not, let anger <sup>4</sup>go out from the thorn bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon (<a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>; and that "wine" signifies the good of charity and truth of faith, n. <a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin has "fifth" for "fourth."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The Latin has "sixth" for "fifth."<br><br>3.&nbsp;The Latin has "almost" for "of punishment;" "paene" for "poenae."<br><br>4.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "fire," as is also found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9277.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9277</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 638 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>638. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_4" target=_top>4</a>.] "Hi sunt duae oleae, et duo candelabra." - Quod significet bonum amoris in Dominum, et charitatis erga proximum, ac verum doctrinae et fidei, ex quibus caelum et ecclesia, constat ex significatione "oliveti", "oleae" et "olivae", quod sit in lato sensu regnum caeleste Domini, et inde ecclesia caelestis; quae ab aliis ecclesiis distinguitur in eo, quod illi a quibus illa ecclesia existit sint in amore in Dominum et in amore erga proximum; inde est quod per "oleam" et "olivam" uterque ille amor, seu bonum utriusque amoris, significetur; (quod "olea" et "oliva" illam ecclesiam, seu illa bona ecclesiae, significet, constabit ex sequentibus): et ex significatione "candelabri", quod in lato sensu sit regnum spirituale Domini, et inde ecclesia spiritualis; et quia principale illius ecclesiae est verum doctrinae et verum fidei, ideo etiam haec per "candelabra" significantur. (Quod illa per "candelabrum" in sensu spirituali intelligantur, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_62" target=_top>62</a>.)<p>[2] Quod dicatur quod "duo testes sint duae oleae et duo candelabra", quae tamen sunt quatuor, est quia "duo" significant conjunctionem et inde unum; sunt enim duo quae faciunt unum, nempe bonum et verum; bonum non est bonum nisi ex vero, et verum non est verum nisi ex bono; quare cum duo illa faciunt unum, tunc primum sunt et existunt; haec conjunctio in unum vocatur conjugium caeleste, et ex illo conjugio est caelum et ecclesia; simile est cum bono caelesti quod per "duas oleas" significatur, et cum bono spirituali quod per "duo candelabra"; nam bonum in caelesti regno Domini est bonum amoris in Dominum, ac verum illius boni vocatur bonum amoris erga fratrem et socium; ac bonum in regno spirituali Domini est bonum charitatis erga proximum, ac verum illius boni vocatur bonum fidei; sed de his aegre potest justa idea haberi, nisi sciatur quale boni caelestis, et quale boni spiritualis, et quae differentia intercedit: ex his constare potest unde est quod "duo testes" dicantur "duae oleae et duo candelabra." <p>(Quod "duo" significent conjunctionem in unum, seu conjugium caeleste, videatur supra n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_532" target=_top>532</a>, fin. )<p>[3] Quod "olea" significet ecclesiam caelestem, est quia per "arbores" in genere significantur perceptiones et cognitiones, et omnis ecclesia est ecclesia ex cognitionibus veri et boni, et secundum perceptionem illarum; et quia "oleum" significat bonum amoris (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_375" target=_top>375</a> [a, d, e]), ideo "olivetum" ac "olea" significat ecclesiam, in qua id bonum regnat. Sunt tres arbores quae principaliter ecclesiam significant, nempe "olea", "vitis", et "ficus"; "olea" ecclesiam caelestem, "vitis" ecclesiam spiritualem, et "ficus" ecclesiam externam caelestem et spiritualem.<p>[4] Quod talia, quae descripta sunt, per "duas oleas" et per "duo candelabra" significentur, quisque potest videre et concludere ex eo, quod illa dicantur "testes", proinde quae testantur de Domino, hoc est, agnoscunt et confitentur Ipsum; tum quod in sequentibus de illis dicatur quod "bestia occiderit illos", et quod postea "spiritus vitae a Deo intraverit in illos"; hoc non dici potest de oleis et de candelabris, nisi "oleae" et "candelabra" significent talia quae sunt apud angelos caeli et apud homines ecclesiae a Domino, quae testantur de Domino, seu faciunt ut angeli et homines testentur de Ipso; nam angeli et homines non ex se testari de Domino possunt, sed bonum et verum quae apud illos sunt ex Domino, hoc est, Ipse Dominus ex suo bono et vero quae apud illos.<p>[5] In Verbo multis in locis nominantur horti et silvae, tum oliveta, et vineae, ut et arbores plurium generum, prout "olea", "vitis", "ficus", "cedrus", "populus", "quercus"; sed nemo hactenus novit quod singula illa aliquid spirituale, quod est caeli et ecclesiae, significent, praeter quod "vinea" significet ecclesiam; sed usque non modo "vinea significat ecclesiam, sed etiam "olivetum", tum "silva cedri" seu "Libanus"; immo etiam arbores, sicut "olea", "vitis", " ficus", "cedrus"; et quia significant ecclesiam, ac spiritualia quae sunt ecclesiae, ideo toties in Verbo nominantur.<p>[6] Quod hortos et silvas attinet; "horti" seu "paradisi" in specie significant intelligentiam et sapientiam quae sunt hominibus ecclesiae; ac "silvae" seu "nemora" significant intelligentiam naturalis hominis, quae in se spectata est scientia, inserviens intelligentiae spiritualis hominis; "olivetum" autem et "vinea" significant ecclesiam, "olivetum" ecclesiam caelestem, seu ecclesiam quae in bono amoris in Dominum est, et "vinea" ecclesiam spiritualem, seu ecclesiam quae in bono charitatis erga proximum est, et inde in veris fidei; "olea" et "vitis" etiam similia significant, et hoc ex causa quia "oleum" significat bonum amoris in Dominum, ac "vinum" bonum charitatis erga proximum ac bonum fidei; "ficus" autem significat ecclesiam utramque tam caelestem quam spiritualem, sed externam. Quod talia significentur per illa, est ex repraesentativis in mundo spirituali, proinde ex correspondentia; nam in caelo intimo, ubi est regnum caeleste Domini, et amor in Ipsum regnat, oliveta et ficus faciunt illorum paradisos et silvas; at in caelo secundo faciunt vineae, et plura genera arborum fructiferarum; similiter in caelo ultimo, sed cum differentia quod in hoc caelo arbores non tam nobiles sint. Quod in caelis talia existant, est causa, quia correspondent sapientiae, intelligentiae, amori, charitati et fidei angelorum qui in illis caelis sunt. Ex his nunc constare potest unde est quod "testes" dicantur "oleae"; nempe, quia per "oleas" intelliguntur omnes qui ecclesiam caelestem Domini constituunt, hoc est, qui in bono amoris in Dominum sunt, et in bono amoris erga fratrem et socium.<p>[7] Quod talia per "oliveta", "oleas" et "olivas" in Verbo significentur, constare potest ex sequentibus locis:<p>- Apud Sachariam,<p>"Duae oleae juxta" candelabrum, "una a dextra lecythi et altera juxta sinistram ejus;.... et duae baccae olivarum, .... hi duo filii oleae stantes juxta Dominum totius terrae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_4_3" target=_top>4:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_4_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_4_12" target=_top>12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_4_14" target=_top>14</a>):<p>agitur ibi de fundatione Domus seu Templi a Serubbabele, et per "Domum" seu "Templum" significatur ecclesia; quare visum est prophetae candelabrum, et juxta illud duae oleae, similiter paene ut hic Johanni in Apocalypsi; et per "duas oleas" et "baccas olivas" significantur bona caelestia, quae sunt amoris in Dominum, et amoris erga fratrem et socium; hoc bonum significatur per "oleam" visam "juxta sinistram lecythi", et illud bonum per "oleam ad dextram ejus": vera hujus boni intelliguntur per "filios oleae stantes juxta Dominum totius terrae"; "stare juxta Ipsum" significat esse et existere ab Ipso.<p>[8] Quoniam "oleae" significabant illa bona, ideo<p>Cherubi in medio Domus seu Templi facti sunt ex ligno olei, similiter fores ad adytum, et postes (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_6_23-33" target=_top>1 Regnum 6:23-33</a>);<p>"cherubi" enim, ut et "fores" ac "postes" ad adytum Templi, significabant custodiam, ne aditus sit ad Dominum nisi quam per bonum amoris; ac "adytum" significabat ubi Dominus; et "lignum olei" bonum amoris, quia "olivetum", "olea" et "oliva" significabant caelestia quae sunt amoris.<p>[9] Quia "olivetum" et "olea" significabant ecclesiam, quae in amore in Dominum est, inde<p>Oleum sanctitatis, quo ungebantur omnia sancta ecclesiae, factum est ex oleo olivae, et aromatibus ei admixtis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_23" target=_top>Exodus 30:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_638/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_24" target=_top>24</a>);<p>nam omnia ecclesiae, quantum ex amore in Dominum ducunt, tantum sancta Divina sunt; inde per id oleum inducebatur repraesentativum Domini ac caeli et ecclesiae.
