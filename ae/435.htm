<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 435</h4><p>435. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.- That this signifies the good of life thence, is plain from the representation of the tribe of Gad, which is the good of life, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of twelve thousand sealed, which means that all such are in heaven, and come into heaven. Upon this subject the two preceding articles may be consulted. Before we show from the Word the representation of Gad and of the tribe named after him, something shall be said respecting the meaning of the good of life, which the tribe of Gad here signifies. Good of life is from a celestial origin, from a spiritual origin, and from a natural origin. The good of life from a celestial origin is that which results from the good of love to the Lord by means of truths from that good, the good of life being the effect of these. This good of life is that which is signified here by the tribe of Gad, therefore it is said, the good of life thence, that is to say, from the good of love to the Lord signified by the tribe of Judah, by means of truths from that good, signified by the tribe of Reuben. The good of life from a spiritual origin is the good of life which results from the good of charity towards the neighbour, by means of truths from that good, and this good of life is meant by Manasseh.</p><p>[2] The twelve tribes of Israel are here divided into four classes, and there are three tribes in each class. These three tribes in a series signify such things as from beginning to end, or from first to last, form that very essential universal of the church, which is signified by the first tribe in the class. The three tribes first named, that is to say, the tribes of Judah, Reuben, and Gad, signify those things which fully constitute celestial good; but the three following tribes, namely, the tribes of Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh, signify those which fully constitute spiritual good; similarly the tribes which afterwards follow.</p><p>[3] There are also three things which fully constitute and form every universal essential, the good of love, truth from that good, and the resulting good of life. The good of life is the effect of the other two. For unless there be a third, the two former have no existence; in other words, the good of love, and truth from that good, cannot exist without the good of life. These three are like the final cause, the efficient cause, and the effect. The good of love is the final cause, truth from that good is the efficient cause or that by means of which good is brought into effect, and the good of life is the effect in which the former causes exist, and without which they have no existence or subsistence. Those three also are like the beating of the heart, the respiration of the lungs, and the action of the body; these make one. For if the body does not act, or suffer itself to be put in action, as is the case when a man dies, the other two cease. The case is similar with the good of love, with truth from that good, and with the good of life. The good of love is like the heart, and is also meant by heart in the Word; truth from that good is like the lungs, and is meant in the Word by spirit and soul; and the good of life is like the body, in which the former act and live. There are three similar conditions in everything that exists, and when the three exist together, the formation is complete.</p><p>[4] It shall first be explained what is signified by Gad, or the tribe of Gad, in every sense. Gad, in the highest sense, signifies the Lord as to Omnipotence and Omniscience. In the internal sense, it signifies the good of truth, and in the external sense, works therefrom, which are the good of life. Gad has these significations, because in every part and detail of the Word there is an inmost, an internal, and an external sense. In the inmost sense is the Lord alone, for that sense treats of Him, of the glorification of His Human, of the orderly arrangement of the heavens, of the subjugation of the hells, and of the establishment of the church by Him. Therefore each tribe, in the inmost sense, signifies the Lord in regard to some attribute and work of His. But in the internal sense heaven and the church are treated of, and doctrine is laid down; but the Word in the external sense, is such as it is in the sense of the letter. There are three senses in the Word because there are three heavens; the inmost or celestial sense is for the inmost or third heaven, the internal or spiritual sense for the middle or second heaven, and the external or spiritual-natural sense for the first or ultimate heaven.</p><p>[5] The reason why the tribe of Gad, in this passage of the Apocalypse, where the twelve tribes are named, signifies the good of life, is, that it follows in order after Judah and Reuben; and Judah signifies the good of love, Reuben, truth from that good, and therefore Gad, the good of life. For from the good of love, by means of truths from it, the good of life exists, the good of life being the third in order, since it is the effect of the two former, as said above. Because the good of life is the good of the natural man, therefore an inheritance was given to the tribe of Gad beyond Jordan, and also to the tribe of Reuben, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. For the land which was beyond Jordan signified the external church, as shown in the article above, and the things of the external church, are those which proceed from the natural man. The church itself, regarded in itself is in the internal or spiritual man, but the external church is in the external or natural man; these nevertheless act as one, like cause and effect.</p><p>[6] That to the tribe of Gad an inheritance beyond Jordan was given is evident in Moses; for all inheritance was given to Reuben, to Gad, and to half the tribe of Manasseh beyond Jordan where the land of cattle was; and it was given on the condition that they should cross over armed with the rest to take possession of the land of Canaan (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_32_1.htm">Num. 32:1</a> to end; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_34_14.htm">34:14</a>).<p>Further:<p>"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon within the river and the border, and even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; the plain also, and Jordan, and the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea, the plain, the Salt Sea, under the aqueducts of Pisgah eastward" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_3_16.htm">Deuteronomy 3:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_3_17.htm">17</a>).<p>And in Joshua:<p>"And Moses gave unto the sons of Gad that their border should be Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before the faces of Rabbah; and from Heshbon unto Ramath of Mizpeh, and Betonim" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_24.htm">13:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_26.htm">26</a>).<p>The signification of Gad is not only evident from the places in the Word where he is mentioned, but also from the lands given to that tribe for an inheritance wherever they are mentioned in the Word, as Heshbon, Jazer, Rabbah, Ramath of Mizpeh, the river of Arnon, Chinnereth, the aqueducts of Pisgah, and others. What those lands signify in the spiritual sense, cannot be known, unless the signification of the tribe of Reuben, of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasseh be known, to whom those lands were given for a possession; for they denote such things as are signified by those tribes, both in an extended and in a limited sense, as in Jeremiah:</p><p>[7] "Against the sons of Ammon, Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir? Why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? Therefore, behold, the days come, in which I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it shall become a heap of desolation, and her daughters shall be burned with fire; and Israel shall inherit their heirs. Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird ye with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_1.htm">49:1-3</a>).<p>These words cannot be understood, unless it be known what the sons of Ammon, Heshbon, and Rabbah signify. For Rabbah, Heshbon, and half of the land of Ammon, were given to the tribe of Gad for an inheritance; therefore those lands signify specifically such things as are signified by Gad in general; for it is said why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in their cities? For all the names of lands, regions, cities, rivers, and peoples in the Word, signify things of the church. Gad signifies the good of life according to truths of doctrine; Israel, the church as to truth. The sons of Ammon signify the falsifications of truth; Heshbon signifies the fructification of truth in the natural man; while the daughters of Rabbah signify the affections of truth also in the natural man, and Ai signifies the doctrine of truth. When these things are known, the spiritual sense of the whole passage will be seen to follow in the following series: Against the sons of Ammon, signifies against the falsifications of truth. Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? signifies, are there not in the church the knowledges of truth and good? Israel denotes the church, his sons denote truths, and heir denotes the good of truth. Why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? signifies whence is it that truth falsified has destroyed the good of life, and also perverted the doctrinals which teach the good of life. Behold, the days come, in which I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it shall become a heap of desolation, signifies the destruction of that doctrine, or of falsified truth, and the destruction of those who hold it. And her daughters shall be burned with fire, signifies that the affections of that doctrine shall become lusts of evil. Then shall Israel inherit their heirs, signifies that the church shall perish as to goods. Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated, signifies that there is no longer any fructification of truth from good, because the doctrine of truth is destroyed; Cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird ye with sackcloth, lament, signifies, that the affections of truth are no more; and run to and fro among the fences, signifies thought and life from falsities. For their king shall go into captivity, signifies because truth is no more; and his priests and his princes together, signifies that both goods and the truths of good are no more. From these things it is plain that by the lands of the inheritance of Gad are signified similar things specifically as in general by Gad; and that the significations of the lands mentioned in the Word may be known from the signification of the tribes to whom they were given for an inheritance.<p>What else is meant by the lands which in Ezekiel are said to be given for an inheritance to the tribe of Gad (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_27.htm">48:27</a>)? That the tribe of Gad is not meant, but that attribute of the church which is signified by Gad, is evident; for the tribe of Gad did not then exist, neither will exist.</p><p>[8] That Gad signifies the good of life from truths of doctrine, is evident from the blessing of that tribe by Moses:<p>"To Gad he said, Blessed is he who hath given breadth to Gad; as a lion he dwelleth, and seizeth the arm, yea the crown of the head, and he seeth the first-fruits for himself; for there is the portion of the hidden lawgiver; whence have come the heads of the people; he has executed the justice of Jehovah, and judgments with Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_20.htm">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_21.htm">21</a>).<p>In these words, by Gad are described the good of life according to truths from the Word, and the influx of heaven into that good. The influx of truth into that good from the Lord, is signified by Blessed be he who hath given breadth to Gad. Breadth signifies truth, Gad the good of life; and "blessed" the Lord Himself. As a lion he dwelleth, signifies that he is safe from falsities. He seizeth the arm, yea the crown of the head, signifies that he is nourished by truths external and internal; for arm, and the crown of the head in sacrifices, signified such things. He seeth the first-fruits for himself, signifies that they are from primary things. For there is the portion of the hidden lawgiver signifies truths Divine hidden therein; intelligence thence is signified by whence have come the heads of the people; he executed the justice of Jehovah, signifies the good works thence. And His judgments with Israel, signifies the truths of the church thence.</p><p>[9] Gad signifies the good of life because he was named from "troop" (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_10.htm">Genesis 30:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_11.htm">11</a>); for Gad in Hebrew signifies a troop, and by a troop, in the spiritual sense, are signified works, and the good of life consists in doing goods which are works. See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>)<p>may be seen explained in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_11.htm">65:11</a>) ([AC 6405]). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 435</h4><p>435. Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand sealed, signifies the good of life therefrom. This is evident from the representation of "the tribe of Gad," as being the good of life (of which presently); also from the signification of "twelve thousand sealed," as being that all such are in heaven and come into heaven (as explained in the two preceding articles). Before showing from the Word what in the church was represented by "Gad" and by the tribe named from him, something shall be said respecting what is meant by the good of life, which is here signified by "the tribe of Gad." There is the good of life from a celestial origin, from a spiritual origin, and from a natural origin. The good of life from a celestial origin is the good of life that comes from the good of love to the Lord through truths from that good; the good of life is an effect of these. Such good of life is what is here signified by "the tribe of Gad;" therefore it is called "the good of life therefrom," namely, from the good of love to the Lord, which is signified by "the tribe of Judah," through truths from that good, which are signified by "the tribe of Reuben." The good of life from a spiritual origin is the good of life that comes from good of charity towards the neighbor through truths from that good; this good of life is meant by "Manasseh."</p><p>[2] For the twelve tribes of Israel are here divided into four classes, and there are three tribes in each class, and the three in series signify such things as from beginning to end, or from first to last, fully constitute that universal essential of the church that is signified by the first tribe. The three tribes first named, that is, the tribes of Judah, Reuben, and Gad, signify those things that fully constitute celestial good; but the three following tribes, namely, the tribes of Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh, signify those that fully constitute spiritual good. So it is with the tribes that follow.</p><p>[3] Moreover, there are three things which fully constitute and form each universal essential, namely, the good of love, the truth from that good, and the good of life therefrom. The good of life is the effect of the other two; for unless there is a third that is brought forth, the two former can have no existence, that is, unless there is the good of life, the good of love and truth from that good can have no existence. These three are like the final cause, the effecting cause, and the effect. The good of love is the final cause, truth from that good is the effecting cause or that through which good is brought into effect, and the good of life is the effect in which the prior causes have existence; and these have no existence unless there is an effect in which they may exist and subsist. Again, these three are like the pulse of the heart, the respiration of the lungs, and the action of the body; these make a one: for if the body does not act, or does not let itself be put in action, as is the case when man dies, the other two cease. It is the same with the good of love, the truth from that good, and the good of life. The good of love is like the heart, and is also meant by "heart" in the Word; truth from that good is like the lungs, and is also meant by "breath" and "soul" in the Word; and the good of life is like the body in which the others act and live. Three like things are in everything that has existence, and when the three exist together there is full formation.</p><p>[4] What is signified by "Gad," or "the tribe of Gad," in every sense shall first be explained. In the highest sense "Gad" signifies the Lord in respect to omnipotence and omniscience; in the internal sense the good of truth; and in the external sense works therefrom, which are the good of life. "Gad" signifies such things because in each and every thing of the Word there is an inmost, an internal, and an external sense. In the inmost sense is the Lord alone for it treats of Him, of His glorifying His Human, arranging the heavens in order, subjugating the hells, and establishing the church from Himself; therefore in the inmost sense each tribe signifies the Lord in respect to some attribute and work of His; while in the internal sense heaven and the church are treated of, and doctrine is taught. But the Word in the external sense is such as it is in the sense of the letter. There are three senses in the Word, because there are three heavens; the inmost or celestial sense is for the inmost or third heaven, the internal or spiritual sense is for the middle or second heaven, and the external or spiritual-natural sense is for the first or lowest heaven.</p><p>[5] In this passage of Revelation, where the twelve tribes are mentioned, "the tribe of Gad" signifies the good of life, because it follows in order after Judah and Reuben, and "Judah" signifies the good of love, "Reuben" the truth from that good, consequently "Gad" signifies the good of life; for the good of life has existence from the good of love, through truths from that good, the good of life following as the third in order, being the effect of the two former as was said above.<p>Because the good of life is the good of the natural man, therefore an inheritance was given to the tribe of Gad <sup>1</sup>beyond Jordan, together with the tribe of Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh; for the land that was beyond Jordan signified the external church (as was shown in the article above), and the things that go forth from the natural man belong to the external church. The church itself regarded in itself is in the internal or spiritual man; but the external church is in the external or natural man, yet these must act as a one, like cause and effect.</p><p>[6] That an inheritance beyond Jordan was given to the tribe of Gad is evident in Moses:<p>To Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh an inheritance was given beyond Jordan, which was a place for cattle; and it was given with the condition that they should cross over, armed, with the rest, to take possession of the land of Canaan (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_32_1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_34_14.htm">34:14</a>).<p>Unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave Gilead even unto the brook of Arnon within the brook and the border, and even unto the brook Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; the plain also, and Jordan, and the border from Chinnereth even unto the sea, the plain, the salt sea, under the springs of Pisgah toward sunrise (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_3_16.htm">Deuteronomy 3:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_3_17.htm">17</a>).<p>And in Joshua:<p>Moses gave to the sons of Gad that Jazer should be their border, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, even unto Aroer that is before the faces of Rabbah; and from Heshbon unto Ramath of Mispeh, and Betonim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_24.htm">Joshua 13:24-28</a>).<p>The signification of "Gad" can be seen not only from the passages in the Word where Gad is mentioned, but also from the lands given to that tribe for an inheritance, where these also are mentioned in the Word, as Heshbon, Jazer, Rabbah, Ramath of Mispeh, the brook of Arnon, Chinnereth, the springs of Pisgah, and many other places. What these lands signify in the spiritual sense no one can know unless he knows the signification of "the tribe of Reuben, of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasseh," to whom these lands were given for a possession; for they signify such things as are signified by those tribes in a wide and in a restricted sense.</p><p>[7] As in Jeremiah:<p>Against the sons of Ammon: Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir? Why then hath their king inherited Gad, and his people dwelt in the cities thereof? Therefore behold, the days come in which I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it shall become a heap of desolation, and her daughters shall be burned with fire, and Israel shall be heir unto them that were his heirs. Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry out, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird ye with sackcloth; lament, and wander about among the walls, for their king shall go into exile, and his priests and his princes together (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1-3</a>).<p>Unless one knows what is signified by "Gad" and by "Israel," he cannot know what is here signified by "the sons of Ammon," by "Heshbon," and by "Rabbah;" for Rabbah, Heshbon, and half of the land of Ammon were given to the tribe of Gad for an inheritance; therefore those lands signify such things in particular as are signified in general by Gad; for it is said "Why then hath the king of the sons of Ammon inherited Gad, and his people dwelt in the cities thereof?" For all names of lands, of regions, of cities, of rivers, and of peoples, in the Word signify the things of the church. "Gad" here signifies the good of life according to the truths of doctrine; "Israel" the church in respect to truth; "the sons of Ammon" signify the falsifications of truth; "Heshbon" signifies the fructification of truth in the natural man; "the daughters of Rabbah" signify the affections of truth in the natural man, and "Ai" the doctrine of truth. When these things are known, the spiritual sense of these words follows in this series: "Against the sons of Ammon" signifies against the falsifications of truth; "hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir?" signifies, are there in the church no knowledges of truth and good? "Israel" meaning the church, "his sons" truths, and "heir" the good of truth; "why then hath their king inherited Gad, and his people dwelt in the cities thereof?" signifies, why hath truth falsified destroyed the good of life, and also perverted the doctrinals according to which is life? "Behold, the days come, in which I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and it shall become a heap of desolation," signifies the destruction of that doctrine, that is, of truth falsified, and the destruction of those who are in it; "and her daughters shall be burned with fire," signifies that the affections of that doctrine shall become lusts of evil; "and Israel shall be heir unto them that were his heirs," signifies that the church in respect to goods is to perish; "howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated," signifies that there is no longer any fructification of truth from good, because the doctrine of truth is destroyed; "cry out, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird ye with sackcloth, lament," signifies that there are no longer any affections of truth; "and wander about among the walls," signifies thought and life from falsities; "for their king hath gone into exile," signifies because truth is no more; "and his priests and his princes together," signifies that both goods and the truths of good are no more. This makes clear that "the lands of the inheritance of Gad" signify similar things in particular as "Gad" does in general, and that the significations of the lands mentioned in the Word can be known from the signification of the tribes to which they were given for inheritance. The lands that it is said would be given for an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, in Ezekiel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_27.htm">Ezekiel 48:27</a>), mean something else; evidently the tribe of Gad is not meant, but such a constituent of the church as is signified by "Gad," for there was then no tribe of Gad, nor will there be.</p><p>[8] That "Gad" signifies the good of life from the truths of doctrine is evident from the blessing of that tribe by Moses:<p>To Gad he said, Blessed is he who hath given breadth to Gad; as a lion he dwelleth, and he teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head, and he seeth the firstfruits for himself; for there is the portion of the hidden lawgiver; whence came the heads of the people; he hath executed the righteousness of Jehovah, and judgments <sup>2</sup>with Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_20.htm">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_21.htm">21</a>).<p>Here the good of life according to truths from the Word, and the influx of heaven into that good are described by "Gad;" the influx of truth from the Lord into that good is signified by "Blessed is he who hath given breadth to Gad;" "breadth" signifying truth, "Gad" the good of life, and "Blessed" the Lord. To be safe from falsities is signified by "as a lion he dwelleth;" to be nourished by truths external and internal is signified by "he teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head," for "the arm" and "the crown of the head" in sacrifices have this signification; that these truths are from things primary is signified by "he seeth the firstfruits for himself;" truths Divine that lie hidden therein are signified by "for there is the portion of the hidden lawgiver;" intelligence therefrom is signified by "whence came the heads of the people;" good works therefrom are signified by "he hath executed the righteousness of Jehovah;" and truths of the church therefrom are signified by "His judgments with Israel."</p><p>[9] "Gad" signifies the good of life because he was named from the Hebrew word for "troop" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_10.htm">Genesis 30:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_11.htm">11</a>), "gad" in the Hebrew meaning troop, and "troop" in the spiritual sense signifies works; and the good of life consists in doing the goods which are works (respecting which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>).<p>What "Gad" here signifies may be seen explained in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "Dan" for "Gad."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "judgment;" but in explanation below with the Hebrew "judgments." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 435 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>435. "Ex tribu Gadis duodecim millia signati." - Quod significet bonum vitae inde, constat ex repraesentatione tribus Gadis, quod sit bonum vitae (de qua sequitur); et ex siginificatione "duodecim millium signatorum", quod sit quod omnes illi in caelo sint et in caelum veniant (de qua supra in binis praecedentibus articulis). Antequam ex Verbo ostenditur quid per Gadem et per tribum ab illo nominatam in ecclesia repraesentabatur, aliquid dicetur quid intelligitur per bonum vitae, quod hic per "tribum Gadis" significatur: - Datur bonum vitae ex origine caelesti, ex origine spirituali, et ex origine naturali. Bonum vitae ex origine caelesti est bonum vitae quod fit ex bono amoris in Dominum per vera ex illo bono; bonum vitae est effectus illorum: hoc bonum vitae est quod hic per "tribum Gadis" significatur; quare dicitur bonum vitae inde, nempe ex bono amoris in Dominum quod per "tribum Jehudae" significatur, per vera ex illo bono quae per "tribum Reubenis" significantur. Bonum vitae ex origine spirituali est bonum vitae quod fit ex bono charitatis erga proximum per vera ex illo bono; hoc bonum vitae intelligitur per "Menassen. "<p>[2] Duodecim enim tribus Israelis hic divisae sunt in quatuor classes, et sunt tres tribus in qualibet classe; quae tres in serie significant talia quae plene a principio ad finem seu a primo ad ultimum constituunt ipsum universale essentiale ecclesiae quod per primam tribum significatur; tres tribus primum nominatae, nempe tribus Jehudae, Reubenis et Gadis, significant illa quae constituunt plene bonum caeleste; tres autem tribus sequentes, nempe tribus Ascheris, Naphthali et Menasses, significant illa quae constituunt plene bonum spirituale; similiter tribus postea sequentes.<p>[3] Sunt etiam tria quae plene constituunt et formant unumquodvis universale essentiale; nempe, bonum amoris, verum ex illo bono, et inde bonum vitae; bonum vitae est effectus illorum, nam nisi tertium sit quod producitur, bina priora non dantur; hoc est, nisi bonum vitae sit, bonum amoris et verum ex illo bono non dantur. Haec tria sunt sicut causa finalis, causa efficiens, et effectus; bonum amoris est causa finalis, verum ex illo bono est causa efficiens seu per quod bonum efficit, et bonum vitae est effectus in quo priores causae existunt; quae non existunt nisi effectus sit in quo existant et sub sistant. Sunt etiam tria illa sicut pulsus cordis, respiratio pulmonum, et actio corporis; haec unum faciunt; nam si non corpus agit aut se non agi patitur, ut fit cum homo moritur, duo illa cessant: simile est cum bono amoris, vero ex illo bono, et bono vitae; bonum amoris est instar cordis, etiam intelligitur per "cor" in Verbo; verum ex illo bono est instar pulmonum, etiam intelligitur in Verbo per "spiritum" et "animam" et bonum vitae est instar corporis in quo illa agunt et vivunt: similia tria sunt in unaquavis re quae existit, et cum tria illa simul existunt est formatio plena.<p>[4] Quid per "Gadem" seu per "tribum Gadis" in omni sensu significatur, primum dicetur: per "Gadem" in supremo sensu significatur Dominus quoad omnipotentiam et omniscientiam, in sensu interno bonum veri, et in sensu externo opera inde quae sunt bonum vitae. Quod talia per "Gadem" significentur, est quia in omnibus et singulis Verbi est sensus intimus, internus, et externus: in sensu intimo est solus Dominus, agitur enim ibi de Ipso, de glorificatione Humani Ipsius, de ordinatione caelorum, subjugatione infernorum, et de instauratione ecclesiae ab Ipso; quare singulae tribus significant Dominum quoad aliquod Ipsius attributum et opus, in sensu intimo: in sensu autem interno agitur de caelo et de ecclesia, et traditur doctrina: Verbum vero in sensu externo est quale est in sensu litterae. Quod tres sensus in Verbo sint, est quia tres caeli sunt: sensus intimus seu caelestis est pro intimo seu tertio caelo; sensus internus seu spiritualis est pro medio seu secundo caelo; et sensus externus seu spiritualis naturalis est pro primo seu ultimo caelo.<p>[5] Quod "tribus Gadis" in hoc loco Apocalypseos, ubi duodecim tribus nominantur, significet bonum vitae, est quia in ordine sequitur post Jehudam et Reubenem, ac per "Jehudam" significatur bonum amoris, per "Reubenem" verum ex illo bono, inde per "Gadem" significatur bonum vitae; nam ex bono amoris, per vera ex illo, existit bonum vitae, est enim bonum vitae tertium in ordine quod sequitur, nam est effectus illorum, ut supra dictum est.<p>Quoniam bonum vitae est bonum naturalis hominis, ideo hereditas tribui <sup>1</sup></p><p>Gadis data est trans Jordanem, et simul tribui Reubenis et dimidiae tribui Menassis ibi; terra enim, quae trans Jordanem erat, significabat ecclesiam externam (ut in superiori articulo ostensum est), et ecclesiae externae sunt illa quae procedunt ex naturali homine: ipsa ecclesia in se spectata est in interno seu spirituali homine, externa autem in externo seu naturali, quae tamen unum agent sicut causa et effectus.<p>[6] Quod tribui <sup>2</sup></p><p>Gadis hereditas data sit trans Jordanem, constat apud Mosen,<p>Data est hereditas Reubeni, Gadi et dimidiae tribui Menassis citra Jordanem, ubi terra pecoris; ac data est cum conditione, si armati transirent cum reliquis ad acquirendum terram Canaanem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_435/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_32_1" target=_top>Numeri 32:1</a> ad fin. ; cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_435/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_34_14" target=_top>34:14</a>):<p>porro,<p>"Reubenitis et Gaditis dedi Gilead usque ad fluvium Arnonis, intra fluvium et terminum, et usque ad Jabbokum fluvium, terminum filiorum Ammonis; tum planitiem et Jordanem et terminum a Cinnereth usque ad mare, planitiem, mare salis, infra aquaeductus Pisgae versus ortum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_435/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_3_16" target=_top>Deuteronomius 3:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_435/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_3_17" target=_top>17</a>):<p>et apud Josuam,<p>"Dedit Moses.... filiis Gadis, .... ut esset illis terminus Jaeser, et omnes urbes Gileadis, et dimidium terrae filiorum Ammonis usque ad Aroerem, quae ante facies Rabbae, tum a Chesbone usque ad Ramath Mizpae et Betonim", etc. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_435/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_13_24-28" target=_top>13:24-28</a>).<p>Quid per "Gadem" significatur, non modo constare potest ex locis in Verbo ubi Gad nominatur, sed etiam a terris quae datae tribui illi in hereditatem, ubi illae quoque in Verbo nominantur, sicut ubi nominantur Chesbon, Jaeser, Rabba, Ramath Mizpae, fluvius Arnonis, Cinnereth, aquaeductus Pisgae, et plura; quid illae terrae in sensu spirituali significant, nemo scire potest nisi sciat quid significant "tribus Reubenis", "Gadis" et "dimidia tribus Menassis", quibus illae terrae datae sunt in possessionem; significant enim talia quae in sensu lato et stricto significantur per illas tribus:<p>[7] - Sicut apud Jeremiam,<p>"Contra filios Ammonis:....

Omnia enim nomina terrarum, regionum, urbium, fluviorum et populorum in Verbo significant, res ecclesiae: per "Gadem" ibi significatur bonum vitae secundum vera doctrinae, per "Israelem" ecclesia quoad verum, per "filios Ammonis" significantur falsificationes veri, per "Chesbonem" fructificatio veri in naturali homine, per "filias Rabbae" affectiones veri etiam in naturali homine, ac per "Ai" doctrina veri; ex his cognitis sequitur sensus spiritualis illorum verborum in hac serie: "contra filios Ammonis" significat contra falsificationes veri: "Num filii non Israeli? num heres non illi?" significat nonne in ecclesia sunt cognitiones veri et boni; "Israel" est ecclesia, "filii ejus" sunt vera, "heres" est bonum veri: "quare ergo hereditavit rex eorum Gadem, et populus illius in urbibus ejus habitavit?" significat unde est quod verum falsificatum destruxerit bonum vitae, et quoque perverterit doctrinalia secundum quae vita: "ecce dies venientes quibus audire faciam contra Rabbath filiorum Ammonis clangorem belli, fietque in acervum desolationis, "significat destructionem illius doctrinae nempe falsificati veri, et destructionem illorum qui in illa sunt; "et filiae ejus igne comburentur" significat quod affectiones illius fient concupiscentiae mali; "et hereditabit Israel heredes suos" significat quod peritura ecclesia quoad bona: "ejula Chesbon, quia devastata est Ai", significat quod non amplius fructificatio veri ex bono, quia deperdita est doctrina veri; "clamate, filiae Rabbae, accingite saccos, plangite", significat quod non amplius affectiones veri; "et vagamini inter macerias" significat cogitationem et vitam ex falsis; "quia rex eorum in exilium abivit "significat quia verum non amplius"; "sacerdotes ejus et principes ejus simul" significat quod non amplius bona et vera boni. Ex his patet quod per "terras hereditatis Gadis" similia in specie significentur quae per "Gadem" in genere, et quod terrarum in Verbo nominatarum significationes noscantur ex significatione tribuum quibus datae sunt in hereditatem.
