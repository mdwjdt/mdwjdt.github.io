<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 296</h4><p>296. CHAPTER 5.<p>1. AND I saw the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.<p>2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<p>3. And no one in heaven, neither upon the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.<p>4. And I wept much, that no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look therein.<p>5. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<p>6. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.<p>7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.<p>8. And when he had taken the book, the four animals and the four-and-twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.<p>9. And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue, and people and nation;<p>10. And thou hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<p>11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the animals and the elders: and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;<p>12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and honour, and glory, and blessing.<p>13. And every created thing, which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and strength, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb to ages of ages.<p>14. And the four animals said, Amen. And the four-and-twenty elders fell down and adored him that liveth unto ages of ages.<p>THE EXPLANATION.<p>VERSE 1. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.<p>"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne," signifies the Lord as to omnipotence and as to omniscience: "a book written within and on the back," signifies the state of life of all in heaven and on earth, in general and in particular: "sealed with seven seals," signifies, altogether hidden. </p>

And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.<p>2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<p>3. And no one was able, in heaven nor upon the earth nor under the earth, to open the book, neither to look thereon.<p>4. And I wept much, that no one was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.<p>5. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<p>6. And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<p>7.

And the four animals said, Amen; and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages.<p>EXPOSITION.<p>Verse 1 (<a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>, <a href="../ae/298.htm">298</a>); "a book written within and on the back," signifies the state of life of all in heaven and on the earth, in general and in particular n. <a href="../ae/299.htm">299</a>; "sealed up with seven seals," signifies altogether hidden (n. <a href="../ae/300.htm">300</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 296 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>296. CAPUT V.<p>1. Et vidi in dextra Sedentis super throno librum scriptum intus et a tergo, obsignatum sigillis septem.<p>2. Et vidi angelum fortem praedicantem voce magna, Quis est dignus aperire librum, et solvere sigilla ejus?<p>3. Et nemo potuit in caelo, nec super terra, neque sub terra, aperire librum nec inspicere eum.<p>4. Et ego flebam multum, quod nemo dignus inventus aperire et legere librum nec inspicere eum.<p>5. Et unus ex senioribus dicit mihi, Ne fleto; ecce vicit Leo qui est ex tribu Jehudae, Radix Davidis, aperire librum et solvere septem sigilla ejus.<p>6. Et vidi, et ecce in medio throni, et quatuor Animalium, et in medio seniorum, Agnum stantem tanquam occisum, habentem cornua septem, et oculos septem, qui sunt septem Dei spiritus emissi in omnem terram.<p>7. Et venit et accepit librum e dextra Sedentis super throno.<p>8. Et cum accepisset librum, quatuor Animalia et viginti quatuor seniores prociderunt coram Agno, habentes unusquisque citharas, et phialas aureas plenas suffitibus, quae sunt preces sanctorum.<p>9. Et canebant canticum novum, dicentes, Dignus es accipere librum et aperire sigilla ejus, quia occisus es, et redemisti Deo nos in sanguine tuo, ex omni tribu et lingua, et populo et gente.<p>10. Et fecisti nos Deo nostro reges et sacerdotes, et regnabimus super terra.<p>11. Et vidi et audivi vocem angelorum multorum circum thronum et Animalia et seniores; et erat numerus eorum myriades myriadum et chiliades chiliadum.<p>12. Dicentes voce magna, Dignus est Agnus occisus accipere potestatem et divitias et sapientiam et honorem et gloriam et benedictionem.<p>13. Et omne creatum quod est in caelo et in terra et sub terra, et in mari quae sunt, et quae in illis omnia, audivi dicentes, Sedenti super throno et Agno benedictio et honor et gloria et robur in saecula saeculorum.<p>14. Et quatuor Animalia dicebant Amen; et viginti quatuor seniores prociderunt et adoraverunt Viventem in saecula saeculorum.<p>EXPLICATIO.<p>VERSUS 1.<p>"Et vidi in dextra Sedentis super throno librum scriptum intus et a tergo, obsignatum sigillis septem."<p>1.
