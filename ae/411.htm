<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 411</h4><p>411. (Verse 16) And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us. That this signifies a covering by evils and the falsities thence, is plain from the signification of mountains, as denoting the evils flowing from the loves of self and of the world (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>); and from the signification of rocks, as denoting falsities from evil, concerning which see below; and from the signification of, to fall on us, as denoting to be covered by them. These thing's also must be illustrated from such things as exist in the spiritual world, when the Last Judgment takes place; for they are said concerning the Last Judgment, as is evident from the verse following, where it is said, "for the great day of his anger is come, and who shall be able to stand?" By which day, are meant the time and the state of the Last Judgment. The state of the wicked then is such, that they cast themselves down from the mountains and rocks, upon which they made their habitations, into hells which are deep according to the atrocity of the evils and falsities with them; and this they themselves do, because they cannot endure the Divine good and the Divine truth. The higher heavens are then opened, from which the light of heaven flows in, which is the Divine truth united with the Divine good. By this light, the pretended goods and truths which are with them are restrained; these being restrained, their evils and falsities are opened; and because these and those cannot endure the light of heaven, for they are straitened and tortured by it, therefore they cast themselves from the mountains and rocks, into hells which are deep according to the quality of their evil and falsity; some into gaps and caves, and some into holes and under rocks, which then stand open before them; and after they have cast themselves thither, the openings are closed. In this manner the ejection of evil spirits from the mountains and hills which they occupied, is effected (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/392.htm">392</a>, <a href="../ae/394.htm">394</a>). When these characters are in the caves and under the rocks, the anguish and torment which they suffered from the influx of the light of heaven, then cease; for they have rest in their evils and in the falsities thence, because these were their delights; for the delights of his life remain with every one after death, and the delights of the life are the delights of the respective loves, every delight of his life being the delights of those loves.</p><p>[2] Hence it is evident what is signified by their calling to the mountains and the rocks to fall on them. Also what is signified in Hosea:<p>"They shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_10_8.htm">10:8</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_30.htm">23:30</a>).<p>Here also the Last Judgment is treated of. The light of heaven, which is the Divine truth united with the Divine good, from the influx and presence of which the evil who cast themselves down are perplexed and tormented, is meant by the words immediately following in this verse:<p>"Hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb."<p>The anger of the Lamb is mentioned because they are tormented their torment, however, does not arise thence, but from the evils of their loves and from the falsities of their faith. Because these have formed all the interiors of their mind, for the mind of every one is formed from his love, and the faith thence, so as to be a likeness thereof in form; and because the interiors of the mind of those who are in evils and the falsities thence, are turned away into a contrary part or into a quarter opposite to Divine goods and truths, therefore, when the Divine truth flows in, and endeavours to drive back the interiors of their minds, and thereby to lead them into heaven, which the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord in all cases effects where it flows in, and they are unwilling to recede from the delights of their loves, they thence experience anguish and torment, which cease when they come into the hells, where similar delights or similar loves rule.</p><p>[3] Having shown above (n. <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>) what mountains and hills signify, it shall, therefore, now be shown that rocks signify truth from spiritual good, also the truth and good of faith, but, in an opposite sense, the falsity of faith. That rocks signify such things, is also from appearances in the spiritual world; for rocks (petroe et rupes) appear there as mountains and hills appear, as was shown above, and upon the rocks there dwell those who are in truths from spiritual good, and who are in the truth and good of faith; but the mountains and hills differ from the rocks (petris et rupibus) here in this, that the mountains and hills are of earth, whereas the rocks are of stone; for ground corresponds to the good of love, and hence signifies it, whereas stone corresponds to the truth of faith, and thence signifies it; and as most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so also rocks, and in that sense, they signify the falsity of faith, and this also from correspondence, for those who are in the falsities of faith dwell among the rocks in caverns there.</p><p>[4] That rock signifies truth from good, and the truth of faith, and, in the highest sense, the Lord as to these, is clear from following passages.<p>In Daniel:<p>"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out not by hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay. And the stone that smote the image, became a great rock, and filled the whole earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10376.htm">10376</a>.)</p><p>[5] That a rock signifies the Lord as to the Divine truth is plain from<p>the rock in Horeb, from which the waters were given to the Israelitish people (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_17_5.htm">Exodus 17:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_17_6.htm">6</a>).<p>And that it was commanded,<p>that Moses and Aaron speak unto the rock, and so they should sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of the sons of Israel; but that Moses smote it with a staff twice, wherefore it was denounced unto Moses and Aaron that they should not bring the people into the land of Canaan (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_20_7.htm">Num. 20:7-12</a>).<p>That this rock signified the Lord, is known in the church; but it is not known that the reason of this signification is, that a rock, in the Word, signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; therefore also Moses and Aaron were commanded to speak to it, and thus to sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of the sons of Israel. By the waters also that flowed forth, is signified the Divine truth; and by making the people drink of them is signified to nourish spiritually, which is effected by instructing and teaching. (That waters signify truths, may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_21.htm">48:21</a>).<p>In David:<p>"He clave asunder the rocks in the wilderness, and made the great depths to drink; and he brought streams also out of the rock, and they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_15.htm">Psalms 78:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_35.htm">35</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"He opened the rock, that the waters should flow out; they went in the dry places, like a river" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_41.htm">Psalms 105:41</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Bring forth, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flinty rock into a fountain of waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_8.htm">8</a>).<p>That a rock in these passages signifies the Lord as to Divine truth, or what is the something, Divine truth from the Lord, is evident from what has been said above, and further from the fact, that in those two passages in David, the redemption and the regeneration of the men of the church are treated of, which are effected by Divine truth from the Lord. Redemption [is meant] by these words; "they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer"; regeneration, by these words; "bring forth, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord"; to bring forth, when said of the church, signifies to be reformed and regenerated.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah<p>"Hearken unto me, ye that follow after justice, ye that seek Jehovah; look back to the rock out of which ye were hewn, and to the digging out of the pit out of which ye were digged" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_1.htm">51:1</a>).<p>By the rock is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth, and by the pit is signified the Word, as also in other places; to be hewn out of the rock, and to be digged out of the pit, signify to be regenerated from Divine truths and Divine goods, thus by truths from good from the Lord; for stones that are cut out of a rock, signify truths from the Lord; and ground which is dug out of the pit, signifies good from the Lord, therefore it is called the digging out of the pit.</p><p>[7] In Moses:<p>"Ascribe ye greatness unto our God. He is the Rock, whose work is perfect and all his ways are judgment. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, and feedeth him with the produce of the fields; he maketh him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the stone of the rock. The Rock that begat thee hast thou given to forgetfulness, and hast forgotten God thy Former. Is it not because their Rock has sold them, and Jehovah has shut them up? For their rock is not as our Rock, neither are our enemies judges" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_3.htm">Deuteronomy 32:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_31.htm">31</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the Ancient Church, which was a church that was in truths from good; therefore truths from good are described by various things that correspond, as by, "He made him to ride upon the high places of the earth, he fed him with the produce of the fields, he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the stone of the rock." The understanding of the spiritual things of this church is signified by, "He caused him to ride upon the high places of the earth"; to ride signifying to understand, the high places of the earth denoting the spiritual things of the church; spiritual nourishment thence is signified by, "He fed him with the produce of the fields"; to eat denoting to nourish, and the produce of the fields denoting all things of the church. That they had natural good and spiritual good by Divine truth from the Lord, is signified by, "He made them to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the stone of the rock"; honey denoting natural good, and oil denoting spiritual good, the rock denoting external Divine truth from the Lord, which is for the natural man, and the stone of the rock denoting internal Divine truth from the Lord, which is for the spiritual man. The Jewish Church, which was in no Divine truth, is after this here treated of, concerning which it is said, "The Rock that begat thee hast thou given to forgetfulness, and hast forgotten God thy Former," by which is signified that the Lord, and hence the Divine truth, by which the church is reformed, were rejected. The Rock denotes the Lord as to Divine truth, and reformation thereby from Him is signified by, "that begat thee," and by, "God thy Former." That they were entirely deprived of truth and good, is signified by, "their Rock has sold them, and Jehovah has shut them up," Rock being said of truth, and Jehovah of good; to sell and to shut up denote to be deprived of. That they would be in falsity from evil is signified by, "their rock is not as our Rock, neither are our enemies judges"; their rock denoting falsity, our enemies denoting evils, not judges signifying without truths and good. From these things it is evident that a rock signifies the Lord as to Divine truth, and in an opposite sense falsity.</p><p>[8] In the second book of Samuel:<p>"The Spirit of Jehovah spake in me, and his word was upon my tongue. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake, he that ruleth in the just man, the fear of God that ruleth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_2.htm">23:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">3</a>).<p>Rock is here clearly [used] for the Lord, for by the God of Israel, in the Word, is meant the Lord; therefore it is said, "The Spirit of Jehovah spake in me, and his word was upon my tongue," likewise, "The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me." The Spirit of Jehovah, and His word signify the Divine truth, and the Lord is called the God of Israel from worship, and the Rock of Israel from the Divine truth, from which worship [springs]. Because it is the Lord who is meant, therefore it is said that the Rock of Israel spake. His dominion over those who are in good and those who are in truth, is signified by, ruling over the just man, ruling over him who has the fear of God; just being said of good, and the fear of God of truth. For in that Psalm of David the Lord is treated of; whence also it is evident that the Lord is meant by the God of Israel, and by the Rock of Israel.</p><p>[9] In David:<p>"O that my people had hearkened unto me, that Israel had walked in my ways! I would have fed them with the fat of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_81_13.htm">Psalms 81:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_81_16.htm">16</a>).<p>By the rock here also is meant the Lord as to Divine truth, as may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_31.htm">Psalms 18:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_46.htm">46</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_2.htm">2 Sam. 22:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_3.htm">3</a>, [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_32.htm">32</a>], <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_47.htm">47</a>).<p>The reason why it is said, "Who is God save Jehovah? and, who is a Rock besides our God? is, because where Divine good is treated of, the Lord is called Jehovah; and where Divine truth is treated of, He is called God, and also Rock, as [He is] here. Similarly afterwards, "Jehovah liveth, and my Rock is blessed; and the God of my salvation shall be exalted," signifies that He is to be worshipped by means of truths from good, whence there is salvation; to be exalted, when said of God, is said of worship from good by means of truths.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be well-pleasing in thy sight, O Jehovah, my Rock, and my Redeemer" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_19_14.htm">Psalms 19:14</a>).<p>By Jehovah, the Rock, is signified the same as by Jehovah God, namely, the Lord as to Divine good and Divine truth; and [He is called] Redeemer from regeneration, which is effected by means of the Divine truth. The words of the mouth signify the understanding of truth, and the meditation of the heart the perception of good. In the same:<p>"I say unto God my Rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_42_9.htm">Psalms 42:9</a>).<p>By, God the Rock, is meant the Lord as to Divine truth, here as to defence. In the same:<p>"Unto thee do I cry, O Jehovah, my Rock; be not silent from me; be not thou peradventure silent from me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_28_1.htm">Psalms 28:1</a>).<p>Here also Jehovah and Rock are mentioned, because by Jehovah is meant the Lord as to Divine good, and by the Rock the Lord as to Divine truth, and because both are meant, therefore also it is twice said, "Be not silent from me; be not thou peradventure silent from me"; for one has reference to the Divine good, the other to the Divine truth, for in the Word there is a heavenly marriage in all its details, which is the marriage of good and truth.<p>In Habakkuk:<p>"O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast strengthened him for trial" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_1_12.htm">1:12</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah Jehovah is the Rock of eternity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_26_4.htm">26:4</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Ye shall have a song, as of the night of sanctifying the feast; and gladness of heart, as of one going with a pipe to come into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_29.htm">30:29</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no Rock, I have not known any" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_8.htm">44:8</a>).<p>In David:<p>"We shall make a joyful noise unto the Rock of our salvation; we shall come before his face with confession" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_1.htm">Psalms 95:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_2.htm">2</a>).<p>In the first book of Samuel:<p>"There is none holy as Jehovah; for there is none beside thee; and there is not any Rock like our God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_2_2.htm">2:2</a>).<p>In David:<p>"Upright is Jehovah my Rock" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_92_15.htm">92:15</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation. Also I will make him the first-born, high over the kings of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_27.htm">Psalms 89:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_28.htm">28</a>).<p>In these passages, by Rock is meant the Divine truth from the Lord, and the Lord Himself.</p><p>[11] Besides also in other passages: as in the Evangelists:<p>"Everyone who heareth my words, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a prudent man, who built his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; yet it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock" (<a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>, and in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3579.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3579</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8989.htm">8989</a>). From these things it is now quite clear, that by a rock in the Word is signified the Lord as to Divine truth, or Divine truth from the Lord.</p><p>[12] Hence it is evident what is signified by the Lord's words to Peter, in Matthew:<p>"He said to the disciples, But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answering said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jona; for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in the heavens" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_15.htm">16:15-19</a>).<p>By Peter here is not meant Peter, but Divine truth from the Lord is meant, as in the passages adduced above; for all the Lord's disciples together represented the church, and every one of them some [particular] of the church; Peter the truth of the church, James its good, and John good in act or works. The rest of the disciples represented the truths and goods which are derived from these, in the same manner as the twelve tribes of Israel. That this is the case, will be seen in what follows, when the tribes and the disciples are treated of. Hence it is, that those three disciples are mentioned in the Word more frequently than the others.</p><p>[13] The reason why the Lord addressed those words to Peter is because he then confessed, saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," which in the spiritual sense signifies that He was the Divine truth, which Christ and also the Son of God signify. That Christ [signifies this] may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_42.htm">1:42</a>).<p>Cephas signifies a rock in the Syriac tongue, therefore also Peter, in that text, is everywhere called Cephas; and Cephas also is a rock in the Hebrew tongue, as is evident in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_6.htm">Job 30:6</a> where rocks are mentioned in the plural number; but Peter is not called a rock in the Greek and Latin tongues, because the name was given to him as a person.</p><p>[14] The reason why the Lord said, Simon son of Jona, and afterwards he was called a rock, is, because Simon son of Jona signifies truth from good, or faith from charity; and because as truth from good or faith from charity is only given with those who are in Divine truth from the Lord, and Peter then confessed [the Lord], therefore he is called Peter, not himself, as a person, but that Divine truth which was from the Lord in his confession. That it was from the Lord is meant by the Lord's words, that flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens; by the Father in the heavens is meant the Divine in the Lord, because the Father was in Him, and He in the Father, and thus they were one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/870.htm">Arcana Coelestia 870</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1826.htm">1826</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1827.htm">1827</a>). Hence by Simon son of Jona is signified the truth of good, or truth from good. Because the hells can avail nothing against the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, nor against any man in whom there is Divine truth from the Lord, therefore the Lord declares that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p><p>[15] The Lord further said:<p>"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in the heavens."<p>This signifies that all things are possible to those who are in truths from good from the Lord, in perfect agreement with these words:<p>"Whatsoever things we desire, when ye pray, believe that ye will receive them, and it shall also be done unto you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_8.htm">Matthew 7:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_9.htm">Luke 11:9</a>).<p>How these words are to be understood, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_18.htm">18:18</a>).</p><p>[16] These words were spoken to all, thus not to Peter only. That this is so the Lord in that chapter immediately declares by these words:<p>"I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth in my name respecting anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (verses 19, 20).<p>By the Lord's name is meant everything by which He is worshipped; and because He is worshipped by means of truth from good, which is from Him, this therefore is meant by His name (that this is meant by the Lord's name may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a>, <a href="../ae/135.htm">135</a>). The same, consequently, is signified by, everything they should ask on earth should be done for them in the heavens, which is signified by, whatsoever ye shall bind and loose on earth, shall be bound or loosed in the heavens, for the former words are explained by the Lord by the latter. He who is acquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word, may also know why it is said, If two shall agree, and afterwards, where there are two or three, namely, because two are said of good, and three of truth, consequently, two and three, of all who are in truths from good. (That the Divine truth from the Lord has all power in the heavens and in the earth may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>; and in the work concerning <a href="../hh/230.htm">Heaven and Hell 230</a>, <a href="../hh/231.htm">231</a>, <a href="../hh/539.htm">539</a>; and in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3091.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3091</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6423.htm">6423</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8200.htm">8200</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8304.htm">8304</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9643.htm">9643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10019.htm">10019</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10182.htm">10182</a>.) The reason why two are said of good is, because they signify conjunction by love (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1686.htm">1686</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8423.htm">8423</a>); the reason why three are said of truths is, because they signify all truths in the aggregate, in like manner as twelve (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/577.htm">577</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2130.htm">2130</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3913.htm">3913</a>); therefore when two and three are mentioned in the spiritual world, two and three are not meant, but all those who are in truths from good. (That Peter signifies truth from good which is from the Lord, may be seen in the small work concerning the <a href="../lj/57.htm">Last Judgment 57</a>.)</p><p>[17] Thus far it has been shown what a rock signifies in this sense it now follows that it should be shown what a rock signifies in the opposite sense. In the opposite sense a rock signifies the infernal falsity, which is trusted in; as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>"Hewing out his sepulchre in the height, growing for himself a dwelling in the rock" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_22_16.htm">22:16</a>).<p>The valley of vision is treated of in this chapter, by which is signified the falsity of doctrine confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word. The love of falsity is signified by the sepulchre in the height, and the faith of falsity, by the habitation in the rock; their making such things for themselves, is signified by hewing out and graving for themselves.</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>"In that day they shall cast away [every] man the idols of his silver and the idols of his gold which your hands make for you; then shall Asshur fall by the sword not of a man (vir), and the sword not of a man (homo) shall devour him; his rock also shall pass away for fear, and his princes shall be dismayed by the ensign" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7-9</a>).<p>The subject here treated of is, the judgment upon those who, from their own intelligence, imagine themselves to be wise in Divine things. Such are those who are in the love of self and the world, and who seek the reputation of learning on account of these; such persons, because they cannot see truths, seize on falsities and boast of them as truths. The falsities favouring their principles and their loves, are signified by the idols of silver and the idols of gold; that they are from man's own intelligence, is signified by, which your own hands have made for you; that they should perish by their own falsities, is signified by, "then shall Asshur fall by the sword not of a man (vir), and the sword not of a man (homo) shall devour him." Asshur denoting the Rational perverted, and, consequently, those who are in falsities from their own intelligence; to fall, and to be devoured by the sword, denotes, to perish. This was also represented by the king of Assyria being slain by his own sons (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>) his sons there signifying his own falsities, by which he perished. His rock which shall pass away for fear, signifies all falsity in general, in which such persons trust; and the princes who shall be dismayed by the ensign, signify primary falsities; it is said, by the ensign, because they are not dissipated by any combat with truths, but solely by the sign of combat, which is an ensign. Such also have been seen by me cast down from the rocks upon which they were, by the waving of an ensign.</p><p>[19] In Jeremiah:<p>"Before the voice of the horseman and of the archers the whole city fleeth; they entered the clouds and ascended into the rocks: the whole city is deserted, neither does any man dwell therein" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>).<p>In these words is described the desolation of the church as to truths. The desolation of all the truth of doctrine by false reasonings and the false doctrines thence, is signified by, "the whole city fleeth before the voice of the horseman and of the archers"; the voice of the horseman signifying false reasonings, and the voice of the archers false doctrinals; the whole city fleeth signifies the desolation of all the truth of doctrine, city denoting doctrine. That there is no truth acknowledged, but merely falsity, is signified by, "they entered the clouds, and ascended into the rocks," to enter the clouds signifying [to be] in no acknowledgment of truth, and to ascend into the rocks signifying [to be] in mere falsity.</p><p>[20] I have also seen rocks which consisted of stones heaped together, and without any plains where verdure [could live] as elsewhere upon rocks; upon them were spirits, who, while they lived in the world as men, had been in faith separated from charity which is called faith alone, and had confirmed themselves therein both in doctrine and in life. This is meant by the dryness of the rock, in Ezekiel:<p>"I have set him upon the dryness of the rock; he hath not poured him upon the earth that dust may cover him" (<a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>.</p><p>[21] Most of those in the spiritual world who have their light from the moon there, dwell upon rocks. Those who are spiritual-natural dwell upon rocks that are covered with a thin surface of ground, whence there are plains, verdure, and shrubberies, but not such as are upon the mountains and hills, upon which dwell those who receive light from the sun of heaven; whereas those who are not spiritual-natural, but merely natural, are not at this day upon rocks, but in caverns in the rocks there; and those who are in falsities from evil, dwell among heaps of stones there; all these things are correspondences.</p><p>[22] In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, I am against thee, O mountain that destroyest the whole earth; and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a mountain of burning" (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>).</p><p>[23] In the same:<p>"Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, ye inhabitants of Moab, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the passages of the mouth of the pit" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10549.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10549</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10550.htm">10550</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10551.htm">10551</a>); namely, that it is to see it, not from doctrine, but only from the letter, whence the thought and affection wander in every direction whither the mind leads, nothing being certain to them, whence [arise] perpetual adulterations, which are signified by Moab. This is the case with those who study the Word for the sake of glory and honour, who, because they regard themselves in everything whilst they study the Word, remain outside the Word; whereas those who love the truth and the good thence, are within the Word, for they view it from the Lord, and not from themselves. Hence it is evident what, "Leave the cities and dwell in the rock, ye inhabitants of Moab, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the passages of the mouth of the pit," signifies.</p><p>[24] In the same:<p>"Is not my word like a fire; and like a hammer that scattereth the rock?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_29.htm">23:29</a>).<p>The Word is said to be like a fire and like a hammer, because fire signifies the good of love, and a hammer the truth of faith; for a hammer signifies the same as iron, and iron signifies truth in ultimates, and the truth of faith. Both fire and hammer are mentioned, consequently good and truth, by reason of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word. By the rock which it scatters, is signified falsity in its whole extent, and the doctrine of falsity; but its dispersion or destruction takes place when man, in whom they exist, is judged.</p><p>[25] In Nahum:<p>"Before his indignation who shall stand up? or who shall stand in the wrath of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks shall be overturned before him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_6.htm">1:6</a>).<p>That the indignation, wrath, and anger of Jehovah, signify the Last Judgment, and the state of damnation of those who are in evils and the falsities thence, will be seen in the following articles. The damnation of evils is signified by His wrath, which is poured out like fire; and the damnation of falsities from evils [is signified] by His anger, and by the rocks being overturned before Him for fire signifies the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and rocks signify the falsities thence, and to be overturned signifies to perish. The rocks also upon which those are who are in principles of falsity and thence in falsities of every kind, are visibly overthrown, and those who are upon them are thus cast down into hell; but this takes place in the spiritual world, where all dwell according to the quality of their interiors, to which their externals correspond.</p><p>[26] In Isaiah<p>"Ye who have inflamed yourselves with gods under every green tree, who have slain the children in the rivers under the shelves of the rocks" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_4.htm">57:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_5.htm">5</a>).<p>What it is to be inflamed with gods under every green tree, and to slay the children in the rivers under the shelves of the rocks, no one can know except from the internal sense. In that sense, by being inflamed with gods under every green tree, is signified to worship God from every falsity which occurs; to be inflamed with idols, denotes ardent worship; every green tree denotes every falsity which occurs, for a tree signifies knowledges (cognitions) and perceptions, here knowledges and perception of falsity; and by slaying the children in the rivers under the shelves of the rocks, is signified to extinguish truths by falsities from one's own intelligence; children denoting truths; rivers denoting one's own intelligence; the shelves of the rocks denoting falsities; under the shelves of these signifies that this is done from the Sensual in which the light is ultimate natural, for those who are in this light only, stand under broken rocks, and do not see any truth, and if it is stated they do not perceive it. In such a position have I also seen them in the spiritual world. Whence it is evident that to slay children is not meant to slay children, but to extinguish truths.</p><p>[27] Similarly in David:<p>"Blessed is he who shall take and dash thy infants against the rock" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_137_9.htm">Psalms 137:9</a>).<p>By infants here are not meant infants, but falsities springing up; for the subject treated of is Babylon, whereby are signified the falsities of evil destroying the truths of the good of the church; the destruction of these is signified by dashing them against the rock; the rock denoting the ruling falsity of evil, and to dash denoting to destroy. He who abides only in the sense of the letter of the Word, and thinks no further, may easily be induced to believe, that he is called blessed who thus treats the children of his enemies, when, notwithstanding, it would be an enormous crime; whereas he is blessed who disperses the falsities of evil springing up in the church, which are here signified by the infants of Babylon.</p><p>[28] In Jeremiah:<p>"Who hath heard such a thing as this? the virgin of Israel hath done an abominable thing; doth the snow of Lebanon from the rock desert my fields? will the strange cold flowing waters carry them away? My people have forgotten me, they have burnt incense to vanity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_13.htm">18:13-15</a>).<p>By the virgin of Israel here and elsewhere, is meant the spiritual church, for the Israelites represented this [church]; the abominable thing which they did, was their turning the goods of the church into evils, and the truths of the church into falsities, and worshipping Jehovah from the latter and the former. The evils from which [such] worship [springs] are signified by, "My people have forgotten me"; for he who forgets God is in evils; and the falsities from which [such] worship [springs], are signified by, "they have burned incense to vanity," vanity denoting falsity, and to burn incense denoting worship. "Doth the snow of Lebanon from the rock desert my fields?" signifies whether they have the truths of the church from the Word, rock here signifying the Word, because [it signifies Divine truth], as [was said] above; the snow of Lebanon signifies the truths of the church thence. Snow here signifies the same as water, namely, truths; but snow signifies cold truths, because a church of such a nature is treated of. Lebanon denotes the church from which [they originated], and fields denote all the goods and truths of the church. By "the strange cold flowing waters," are signified falsities in which there is no good, strange waters denoting falsities, and cold denoting, in which there is no good, for truths possess all their heat from the good of love.</p><p>[29] In the same:<p>"Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitress of the valley, [and] thou rock of the plain; that say, Who shall come down against us? and who shall enter into our habitations?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_21_13.htm">21:13</a>).<p>By the inhabitress of the valley and the rock of the plain, are signified those who are in the ultimates of the Word, and do not suffer themselves to be enlightened from the interior; and those who are of such a nature do not see truths, but instead thereof falsities; for all the light of truth being out of heaven from the Lord, comes and descends from the interior. Such are meant by the inhabitress of the valley and the rock of the plain; the valley and the plain denote the ultimates of the Word in which they are; and the inhabitress and the rock signify falsities, the inhabitress falsity of life, and the rock falsity of doctrine. The faith of falsity and evil to which they firmly adhere, believing it to be truths and goods, is signified by their saying, "Who shall come down against us? and who shall enter into our habitations?"</p><p>[30] In Isaiah<p>"Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_10.htm">2:10</a>).<p>To enter into the rock, denotes into falsity, and to hide themselves in the dust denotes into evil. The Last Judgment is here treated of, when those who are in the falsities of evils, and in the evils of falsity, cast themselves into the hells which are in rocks, and under the earths, in the spiritual world; but these things may be seen more amply deduced and explained in the preceding article.<p>In Job:<p>"The mountain falling melteth, and the rock is removed out of his place" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_14_18.htm">14:18</a>).<p>By the mountain is signified the love of evil; and by the rock the faith of falsity; and by melting and being removed out of its place, are signified to perish.</p><p>[31] In David:<p>"Let their judges be cast down through places of the rock" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_141_6.htm">Psalms 141:6</a>).<p>By judges are signified those who are in falsities, and in an abstract sense, the falsities of thought and doctrine. The same is signified by judges in the Word, as by judgments, and judgments signify the truths from which judgments [are made], and, in the opposite sense, falsities. And since those who are in falsities, in the spiritual world, dwell in rocks, it is therefore said, let them be cast down through places of the rock, by which is signified that they are let into their falsities, and dwell in hells corresponding to their falsities. In Job:<p>"To dwell in the cleft of the valleys, in holes of the earth, and in the rocks" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_6.htm">Job 30:6</a>).<p>This [is said] of those who are in the hells, because in evils and in the falsities thence; the hells of those who are in evils as to life, being under valleys and in caves there; and [of those] who are in falsities thence, in rocks. Hence it is evident what is signified by dwelling in the cleft of the valleys, in holes of the earth, and in rocks. (But concerning the caverns and caves in which those dwell who are in the hells, and the clefts and holes by which they are entered, see the article just preceding, n. 410.)</p><p>[32] These things have been adduced that it may be known that by rock, in the opposite sense, is signified falsity in general; this signification of rock is from correspondence, as is evident from the appearances and visible objects in the spiritual world, where all dwell according to the correspondences of the interiors of their mind and life; therefore those who are in wisdom and intelligence, because in love to the Lord, and in charity towards the neighbour, and thence in the spiritual affection of truth, dwell upon mountains and hills of earth, where there are paradises, gardens, rosaries, and lawns; but those who are in the faith of the doctrinals of their church, and in some degree of charity, dwell upon rocks where there are plains upon which are some groves and some trees, and also grassy places; whereas those who were in faith alone, as it is called, as to doctrine and as to life, and thence in falsities of faith and evils of life, dwell among the rocks, in caverns and cells there.</p><p>[33] This signification of rock is from the correspondence [which has been] stated. But the signification of rock from its hardness, is [contained] in the following passages.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"They have made their faces harder than the rock" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_3.htm">5:3</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"As an adamant harder than rock have I made thy forehead; fear ye not" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_8.htm">3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_9.htm">9</a>).<p>In Job:<p>"They shall be graven with an iron pen and with lead in the rock for ever" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_19_24.htm">19:24</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"The hoofs of the horses are counted like rock" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_28.htm">5:28</a>).<p>The reason why hardness is expressed by a rock, is also from the correspondence of a rock with truth from good, for all power belongs to truth from good, as said above; but when truth acts against falsity from evil, then good is blunted, and the remaining truth acts harshly, according to the above words in Ezekiel:<p>"As an adamant harder than rock have I made thy forehead."<p>And truth also without good is hard, but still it is brittle. What, however, has been adduced concerning rocks, will be more fully elucidated by those things that shall be said concerning the signification of stones in the following pages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 411</h4><p>411. Verse 16. And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, signifies to be covered over by evils and by falsities therefrom. This is evident from the signification of "mountains," as being the evils that flow from the loves of self and of the world (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>; also from the signification of "rocks," as being the falsities from evil (of which below); also from the signification of "fall on us," as being to be covered by them. These things, too, are to be illustrated by such things as occur in the spiritual world when the Last Judgment takes place; for they are said respecting the Last Judgment, as is evident from the following verse, where it is said, "For the great day of His anger is come, and who is able to stand?" that "day" meaning the time and state of the Last Judgment. The state of the wicked then is such that from the mountains and rocks upon which they have made their habitations they cast themselves down into the hells, more or less deeply according to the atrocity of the evils and falsities with them; and this they themselves do, because they cannot endure Divine good and Divine truth, the higher heavens then being opened, from which the light of heaven flows in, which is Divine truth united to Divine good, by which light their pretended goods and truths are constricted, and these being constricted their evils and falsities are loosened; and as evils and falsities cannot endure the light of heaven, for they are pained and tortured by it, these spirits cast themselves from the mountains and rocks into the hells, more or less deeply according to the quality of their evil and falsity; some into gaps and caves, and some into holes and rocks, which then stand open before them; but as soon as they have cast themselves in, the openings are closed up. In this way the casting out of evil spirits from the mountains and hills which they have occupied is effected (See above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391-392</a>, <a href="../ae/392.htm">392</a>, <a href="../ae/394.htm">394</a>); and when they are in the caves and among the rocks the pains and torments they suffered from the influx of the light of heaven cease; for they find rest in their evils and in the falsities therefrom, because these had been their delights; for the delights of his life remain with everyone after death, and the delights of life are the delights of their loves, for every delight of life is from love.</p><p>[2] From this the signification of their "calling to the mountains and the rocks to fall on them" can be seen; likewise what is signified in Hosea:<p>They shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_10_8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Hide us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>).<p>This, too, treats of the Last Judgment. The light of heaven, which is Divine truth united to Divine good, by the influx and presence of which the evil who cast themselves down are pained and tormented, is meant by the words immediately following in this verse; "hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb;" it is said "the anger O the Lamb" because they are in torment; but their torment is not from that, but from the evils of their loves and from the falsities of their faith; and because these evils and falsities have formed all the interiors of their mind (for each one's mind is formed by his love and its faith, even so as to be a likeness of these in form), and because the interiors of the mind of those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom are turned away in a contrary direction, or to a quarter opposite to Divine goods and truths, therefore when Divine truth flows in and endeavors to reverse the action of the interiors of their mind, and thereby to lead them into heaven (for this is what Divine truth proceeding from the Lord does everywhere where it flows in), and they are unwilling to abandon the delights of their loves, they suffer anguish and torment; but these cease when they come into the hells where like delights or like loves prevail.</p><p>[3] Having shown above n. <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a> what "mountains and hills" signify, it shall now be shown what "rocks" signify, namely, that they signify truth from spiritual good, also the truth and good of faith, but in the contrary sense the falsity of faith. This signification of "rocks" is also from appearances in the spiritual world; for rocks and crags are seen there as mountains and hills are seen, as was shown above, and upon the rocks there those dwell who are in truths from spiritual good, and who are in the truth and good of faith. The difference between the mountains and hills, and the rocks and crags, is that the former are of soil, and the latter of stone, and "soil" corresponds to and thus signifies the good of love, and "stone" corresponds to and thus signifies the truth of faith. And as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so do "rocks," and in that sense they signify the falsity of faith, and this also from correspondence; for those who are in the falsities of faith dwell there within the rocks in caverns.</p><p>[4] That "rock" signifies truth from good and the truth of faith, and in the highest sense the Lord in respect to these, is evident from the following passages. In Daniel:<p>Thou sawest <sup>1</sup>till that a stone was cut out, not by hands, and it smote the image upon his feet, that were iron and clay. And the stone that smote the image became a great rock and filled the whole earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643[1-4]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10376.htm">10376</a>)</p><p>[5] That "rock" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, is plain from:<p>The rock in Horeb from which waters were given to the Israelitish people (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_17_5.htm">Exodus 17:5-6</a>);<p>and that it was commanded:<p>That Moses and Aaron should speak unto the cliff, and thus should sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of the sons of Israel; but that Moses smote it with a staff two times, therefore it was declared to Moses and Aaron that they should not bring the people into the land of Canaan (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_20_8.htm">Numbers 20:8-13</a>).<p>It is known in the church that this "rock" signified the Lord; but it is not known that it had this signification because "rock" in the Word signifies the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; this was why Moses and Aaron were commanded to speak to it, and thus to sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of the sons of Israel. Also "the waters" that flowed forth signify Divine truth; and "the people drinking of them" signifies to nourish spiritually, which is done by instructing and teaching. (That "waters" signify truths, see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>).<p>In David:<p>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and made them to drink of the great depths; and He brought streams out of the cliff; and they remembered that God was their Rock, and the most high God their Redeemer (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_15.htm">Psalms 78:15-16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_35.htm">35</a>).<p>In the same:<p>He opened the rock that the waters might issue out; they flowed in the dry places, a river (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_41.htm">Psalms 105:41</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob, who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7-8</a>).<p>That "rock" in these passages signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, or what is the same, Divine truth from the Lord, is evident from what has been said above, also from the fact that these two passages in David treat of the redemption and the regeneration of the men of the church, and this is effected by means of Divine truth from the Lord. Redemption is treated of in these words, "they remembered that God was their Rock, and the most high God their Redeemer;" regeneration in these words, "Before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth;" "to be in travail" when predicated of the church, signifying to be reformed and regenerated.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah; look unto the rock out of which ye were hewn, and to the digging out of the pit out of which ye were digged (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>).<p>The "rock" means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and the "pit" signifies the Word, as also in other places; "to be hewn out of the rock" and "to be digged out of the pit," signify to be regenerated by Divine truths and Divine goods, thus by truths from good from the Lord; for "stones," that are cut out of a rock, signify truths from the Lord; and "soil," that is dug out of a pit, signifies good from the Lord, therefore it is called "the digging out of the pit."</p><p>[7] In Moses:<p>Give ye greatness unto our God; the rock, whose work is perfect, and all His ways are judgment. He made him to ride on the high places of the earth, and feedeth him with the increase of the fields; He maketh him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock. The rock that begat thee hast thou given to forgetfulness, and hast forgotten God thy Former. Is it not because their rock hath sold them, and Jehovah hath shut them up? For their rock is not as our rock, neither are our enemies judges (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_3.htm">Deuteronomy 32:3-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_30.htm">30-31</a>).<p>This is said of the Ancient Church, which was a church that was in truths from good; therefore truths from good are described by various things that correspond, as "He made him to ride on the high places of the earth, He fed him with the increase of the fields; He made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock." Intelligence in the spiritual things of this church is signified by "He made him to ride on the high places of the earth;" "to ride" signifying to understand; "the high places of the earth" meaning the spiritual things of the church; spiritual nourishment therefrom is signified by "He fed him with the increase of the fields;" "to feed" meaning to nourish, and "the increase of the fields" meaning all things of the church. That they had natural good and spiritual good through Divine truth from the Lord is signified by "He made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock;" "honey" meaning natural good, "oil" spiritual good; "cliff" external Divine truth from the Lord which is for the natural man, and "flint of the rock" internal Divine truth from the Lord which is for the spiritual man. The Jewish Church, which was not in any Divine truth, is next treated of, and respecting this it is said, "the rock that begat thee hast thou given to forgetfulness, and hast forgotten God thy Former," which signifies that the Lord, and thence Divine truth, by which the church is reformed, were rejected; "rock" meaning the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and "that begat thee," and "God the Former" signifying to be reformed by the Lord by means of Divine truth. That they were altogether deprived of truth and good is signified by "their rock hath sold them, and Jehovah hath shut them up," "rock" having reference to truth, and "Jehovah" to good; "to sell" and "to shut up" means to be deprived of. That they would be in falsity from evil is signified by "their rock is not as our rock, neither are our enemies judges" "their rock" meaning falsity, "our enemies" evils, "not judges" signifying not truths and goods. From this it can be seen that "rock" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and in the contrary sense, falsity.</p><p>[8] In the second book of Samuel:<p>The spirit of Jehovah spoke in me, and His speech was upon my tongue. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke [to me]. He that ruleth over the righteous man, that ruleth over the fear of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2-3</a>).<p>"Rock" here manifestly stands for the Lord, for in the Word "the God of Israel" means the Lord; therefore it is said "the spirit of Jehovah spoke in me, and His speech was upon my tongue," also "the God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me." The "spirit of Jehovah" and "His speech" signify Divine truth, and the Lord is called "the God of Israel" from worship, and "the Rock of Israel" from Divine truth, from which is worship. Because it is the Lord who is meant, it is said that "the Rock of Israel spoke." His dominion over those who are in good and those who are in truth is signified by "He that ruleth over the righteous man, that ruleth over him that hath the fear of God;" righteousness" is predicated of good, and "fear of God" of truth; for this Psalm of David treats of the Lord, which makes clear that the Lord is meant by "the God of Israel," and "the Rock of Israel."</p><p>[9] In David:<p>O that My people may hearken unto Me, that Israel might walk in My ways! I would feed <sup>2</sup>them with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the rock I would satisfy them (<a href="../ae/374.htm">374</a>, where this is explained). In the same:<p>Who is God save Jehovah, or who is a Rock besides my <sup>3</sup>God? Jehovah liveth: and blessed be my Rock; and the God of my salvation shall be exalted (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_2.htm">Psalms 18:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_46.htm">46</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_32.htm">32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_47.htm">47</a>).<p>It is said, "Who is God save Jehovah, and who is a Rock besides my God?" because where Divine good is treated of the Lord is called "Jehovah," and where Divine truth is treated of he is called "God," and also "Rock," as here; so afterwards, "Jehovah liveth, and blessed be my Rock;" "the God of my salvation shall be exalted" signifies that He must be worshiped by means of truths from good, from which is salvation; "to be exalted," in reference to God is predicated of worship from good by means of truths.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be well pleasing before Thee, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_19_14.htm">Psalms 19:14</a>).<p>"Jehovah the Rock" has a like signification as "Jehovah God," namely, the Lord in respect to Divine good and Divine truth; and He is called "Redeemer" from regeneration, which is effected by Divine truth; "sayings of the mouth" signify the understanding of truth, and "the meditation of the heart" the perception of good. In the same:<p>I say unto God my Rock, Why hast Thou forgotten me? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_42_9.htm">Psalms 42:9</a>).<p>"God the Rock" means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, here in respect to defense. In the same:<p>Unto Thee do I call, O Jehovah my Rock; be not silent from me; lest Thou be silent from me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_28_1.htm">Psalms 28:1</a>).<p>Here, too, "Jehovah" and "Rock" are mentioned, because "Jehovah" means the Lord in respect to Divine good, and "Rock" the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and as both are meant it is twice said, "be not silent from me," "lest Thou be silent from me;" one having reference to Divine good, the other to Divine truth, for in the Word there is a heavenly marriage in every particular, which is the marriage of good and truth. In Habakkuk:<p>O Jehovah, Thou hast placed him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast founded him for correction (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_1_12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Trust ye in Jehovah forevermore; for in Jah Jehovah is the Rock of Eternity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_26_4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>).<p>Ye shall have a song as of the night of celebrating the feast; and gladness of heart as of one going with a pipe to come into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>).<p>Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no Rock, I know not any (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>).<p>In David:<p>We will make a joyful noise unto the Rock of our salvation; we will come before His faces with confession (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_1.htm">Psalms 95:1-2</a><p>In the first book of Samuel:<p>There is none holy as Jehovah; and there is no Rock like our God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_2_2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>).<p>In David:<p>Upright is Jehovah my Rock (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_92_15.htm">Psalms 92:15</a>).<p>He shall call me, Thou art my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation. I also will make Him the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_26.htm">Psalms 89:26-27</a>).</p><p>[11] In these passages, "rock" means Divine truth from the Lord and the Lord Himself, as well as in other passages. As in the gospels:<p>Everyone that heareth My words and doeth them, I will liken him to a prudent man, who built his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, yet it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock (<a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3579.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3579</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8989.htm">8989</a>).<p>This makes plainly evident that "rock" in the Word signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, or Divine truth from the Lord.</p><p>[12] From this it can be seen what is signified by the Lord's words to Peter, in Matthew:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, But who say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answering said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens. I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-19</a>).<p>"Peter" here does not mean Peter, but Divine truth from the Lord (as in the passages cited above) for all the Lord's disciples together represented the church; and each one of them some constituent of the church; "Peter" the truth of the church, "James" its good, and "John" good in act, that is, works; the rest of the disciples represented the truths and goods that are derived from these, just as the twelve tribes of Israel. That this is so will be seen in what follows, where the tribes and the disciples are treated of. This is why these three disciples are mentioned in the Word more than the others.</p><p>[13] The Lord addressed these words to Peter because he then confessed, saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," which in the spiritual sense signifies that He is the Divine truth; this is signified by "Christ," also by "the Son of God." (That this is signified by "Christ" see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_42.htm">John 1:42</a>).<p>Cephas in the Syriac language means a rock, and so Peter in that version is everywhere called "Cephas;" moreover, the same word in the Hebrew means a rock (as is evident in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>; andJob <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_6.htm">Job 30:6</a>, where "rocks" are mentioned in the plural number); but Peter is not called a rock [petra] in the Greek and Latin because the name was bestowed upon him as a personal name.</p><p>[14] The Lord said "Simon son of Jonah" and afterwards he was called "a rock," because "Simon son of Jonah" signifies truth from good, or faith from charity; and as truth from good or faith from charity is granted only to those who are in Divine truth from the Lord, and Peter then confessed [the Lord], so he is called "a rock," not himself as a person, but that Divine truth which was from the Lord with him in his confession. That this was from the Lord is meant by the Lord's words, "flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens;" "the Father in the heavens" meaning the Divine in the Lord, since the Father was in Him, and He in the Father and they were one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/870.htm">Arcana Coelestia 870</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/870.htm">Arcana Coelestia 870[1-3]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1826.htm">1826</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1827.htm">1827</a>); consequently "Simon son of Jonah" signifies the truth of good or truth from good. Because the hells have no power against Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, or against any man in whom there is Divine truth from the Lord, therefore the Lord says that "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</p><p>[15] The Lord further said, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens," which signifies that all things are possible to those who are in truths from good from the Lord, in full agreement with these words:<p>All things whatsoever ye ask for, praying, believe that ye are to receive, then shall it be done unto you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_8.htm">Matthew 7:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_9.htm">Luke 11:9</a>).<p>How these words are to be understood see above (n. 405 i), namely, that to ask from the faith of charity is to ask not from self but from the Lord, for whatever anyone asks not from self but from the Lord he receives. That such is the signification of these words, "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens," is clear from the Lord's words to the disciples and to all who are in truths from good from the Lord, in Matthew:<p>Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>).</p><p>[16] These words were spoken to all, thus not to Peter only, as the Lord immediately declares in that chapter in these words:<p>I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth in My name respecting anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by My Father, who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of them (<a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a>, <a href="../ae/135.htm">135</a>.) So "every thing they shall ask on earth shall be done for them in the heavens" has a similar signification as "whatsoever ye shall bind and shall loose on earth shall be bound and shall be loosed in the heavens," for the Lord explains the former words by the latter. One who knows the spiritual sense of the Word can know also why it is said "if two agree," and afterwards, "where there are two or three," namely, because "two" is predicated of good, and "three" of truth, consequently "two and three" of all who are in truths from good. (That Divine truth from the Lord has all power in the heavens and on earth, see above, n. <a href="../ae/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>; and in the work on <a href="../hh/230.htm">Heaven and Hell 230-231</a>, <a href="../hh/539.htm">539</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3091.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3091</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6423.htm">6423</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8200.htm">8200</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8304.htm">8304</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9643.htm">9643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10019.htm">10019</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10182.htm">10182</a>. "Two" is predicated of good because it signifies conjunction by love, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1686.htm">1686</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8423.htm">8423</a>; "three" is predicated of truths because it signifies all truths in the complex, in like manner as "twelve," n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/577.htm">577</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2130.htm">2130</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3913.htm">3913</a>; therefore when "two" and "three" are mentioned in the spiritual world, two and three, are not meant, but all who are in truths from good. That "Peter" signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, see in the small work on <a href="../lj/57.htm">The Last Judgment 57</a>.)</p><p>[17] Thus far it has been shown what "rock" signifies in this sense; it shall now be shown what "rock" signifies in the contrary sense. In the contrary sense "rock" signifies infernal falsity that is trusted in; as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Hewing out <sup>4</sup>thy sepulcher in the height, graving for himself a habitation in the cliff (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_22_16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a>).<p>This chapter treats of "the valley of vision," which signifies the falsity of doctrine confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word; the love of falsity is signified by "the sepulcher in the height," and the belief of falsity by "the habitation in the cliff;" their making such things for themselves is signified by "hewing out" and "graving for themselves."</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>In that day they shall reject every man the idols of his silver and the idols of his gold which your hands make for you; then shall Asshur fall by the sword not of a man [vir], and the sword not of a man [homo] shall devour him: and his cliff shall pass away for awe, and his princes shall be dismayed at the banner (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">Isaiah 31:7-9</a>).<p>This treats of judgment upon those who from self-intelligence believe themselves to be wise in Divine things. Such are those who are in the love of self and the world, and who seek after a reputation for learning for the sake of self; these, because they are unable to see truths, seize on falsities and proclaim them as truths. The falsities that favor their principles and their loves are signified by "the idols of silver and the idols of gold;" that these are from self-intelligence is signified by "which your hands have made for you;" that they will perish by their own falsities is signified by "then shall Asshur fall by the sword not of a man [vir], and the sword not of a man [homo] shall devour him;" "Asshur" meaning the rational perverted, and thence those who are in falsities from self-intelligence; "to fall and to be devoured by the sword" meaning to perish. This was represented also by the king of Assyria in that he was slain by his own sons (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>); "his sons" there signifying his own falsities by which he perished; "his cliff, which shall pass away for awe," signifies all falsity in general, in which such have trusted; and "the princes, who shall be dismayed at the banner," signify the primary falsities; it is said "at the banner," because such falsities are dispersed not by any combat with truths, but by a mere sign of combat, which a banner is. I have seen such cast down from the rocks upon which they were by the waving of an ensign.</p><p>[19] In Jeremiah:<p>The whole city fleeth before the voice of the horseman and the shooter of the bow; they entered the clouds and went up into the rocks, the whole city is forsaken, not a man [vir] dwelleth therein (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>).<p>This describes the church desolated in respect to truths. The desolation of all the truth of doctrine by false reasonings and false doctrinals therefrom is signified by "the whole city fleeth before the voice of the horseman and of the shooter of the bow;" "the voice of the horseman" signifying false reasonings, and "the voice of the shooter of the bow" false doctrinals; "the whole city fleeth" signifies the desolation of all the truth of doctrine, "city" meaning doctrine. That no truth is acknowledged, but falsity alone, is signified by "they entered the clouds and went up into the rocks;" "to enter the clouds" signifying into the non-acknowledgment of truth, and "to go up into the rocks" signifying into mere falsity.</p><p>[20] I have also seen rocks that consisted of stones heaped together, with no level place where verdure grew as elsewhere upon rocks; upon these were spirits who while they lived in the world as men had been in faith separate from charity, which is called faith alone, and had confirmed themselves therein both in doctrine and in life. This is what is meant by "the dryness of the rock," in Ezekiel:<p>She set <sup>5</sup>it upon the dryness of the cliff; she poured it not upon the earth that dust might cover it (<a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>.</p><p>[21] Most of those in the spiritual world who have their light from the moon there, dwell upon rocks. Those who are spiritual-natural dwell upon rocks that are covered with a thin surface of soil, where consequently there are level places, verdure, and shrubberies, but not such as are upon the mountains and hills where those dwell who receive light from the sun of heaven; while those who are not spiritual-natural, but merely natural, are not at this day upon the rocks, but in caverns in the rocks there; and those who are in falsities from evil, dwell among heaps of stones there; all these things are correspondences.</p><p>[22] In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, I am against thee, O mountain destroying the whole earth; and I will stretch out Mine hand against thee and roll thee down from the cliffs, and will make thee a mountain of burning (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>.</p><p>[23] In the same:<p>O ye inhabitants of Moab, forsake the cities and dwell in the cliff, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the passages of the mouth of the pit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10549.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10549-10551</a>), namely, to look at it not from doctrine but from the mere letter; and in consequence of this men wander in every direction whither the disposition, thought, and affection may lead; they are sure of nothing, whence come the perpetual adulterations that are signified by "Moab." This is the case with those who study the Word for the sake of glory and honor; because such regard themselves in everything when studying the Word, they remain outside of the Word; while those who love truth and good from the Word are within the Word, for they look at it not from self, but from the Lord. This makes clear what is signified by "O ye inhabitants of Moab, forsake the cities and dwell in the cliff, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the passages of the mouth of the pit."</p><p>[24] In the same:<p>Is not My word like as fire? and like a hammer that scattereth the cliff? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>.)<p>The Word is said to be "like a fire and like a hammer" because "fire" signifies the good of love, and "hammer" the truth of faith, for "the hammer" has a similar signification as "iron," and "iron" signifies truth in ultimates, and the truth of faith. Both are mentioned, namely, "fire" and "hammer," and accordingly good and truth, because of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word. "The cliff that is scattered" signifies the falsity in the whole complex and the doctrine of falsity; and these are scattered or destroyed, when man with whom they exist is judged.</p><p>[25] In Nahum:<p>Who shall stand before His indignation? or who shall stand up in the glowing of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks shall be overturned before Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>).<p>That the "indignation," "wrath," and "anger" of Jehovah signify the Last Judgment, and the state of damnation of those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom will be seen in the following articles. The damnation of evils is signified by "His wrath, which is poured out like fire;" and the damnation of falsities from evils by "His anger," and "the rocks shall be overturned before Him;" "fire" also signifying the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and "rocks" the falsities therefrom, and "to be overturned" signifies to perish. Moreover, the rocks, upon which are those who are in the principles of falsity and thus in falsities of every kind, are visibly overturned, and those who are upon them are thus cast down into hell; but this occurs in the spiritual world, where all have their dwelling places according to the quality of their interiors to which their externals correspond.</p><p>[26] In Isaiah:<p>Ye that have heated yourselves with gods under every green tree, that slaughter the children in the brooks under the shelves of the cliffs (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>).<p>What is meant by "heating oneself with gods under every green tree, and slaughtering the children in the brooks under the shelves of the cliffs," no one can know except from the internal sense. In that sense "to heat oneself with gods under every green tree" signifies to worship God from every falsity that occurs; "to heat oneself with gods" means ardent worship, and "every green tree" means every falsity that occurs, for "tree" signifies knowledges and perceptions, here the knowledges and perceptions of falsity; and "to slaughter the children in the brooks, under the shelves of the cliffs" signifies to extinguish truths by falsities from self-intelligence; "children" meaning truths, "brooks" self-intelligence, "shelves of the cliffs" falsities; "under the shelves of these" signifies from the sensual, in which there is the ultimate natural light, for those who are in that light only stand under precipitous rocks and do not see any truth, and if it is told them they do not perceive it. In such a position I also have seen them in the spiritual world. This makes evident that "to slaughter the children" means not to slay children, but to extinguish truths.</p><p>[27] So in David:<p>Happy is he who shall seize and shatter thy babes against the cliff (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_137_9.htm">Psalms 137:9</a>).<p>"Babes" mean here not babes but falsities springing up; for Babylon is here treated of, which signifies the falsities of evil destroying the truths of good of the church; the destruction of these is signified by "shattering them against the cliff;" "cliff" meaning the ruling falsity of evil, and "to shatter" meaning to destroy. He who abides in the mere sense of the letter of the Word and does not think beyond it, can easily be led to believe that he is called "happy" who does this with the babes of his enemies, when yet that would be an enormous crime; but he is called "happy" who disperses the falsities of evil springing up in the church, which are here signified by "the babes of Babylon. "</p><p>[28] In Jeremiah:<p>Who hath heard such a thing as this? The virgin of Israel hath done a horrible thing. Shall the snow of Lebanon from the rock leave My fields? Shall the strange cold waters flowing down be snatched away? My people have forgotten Me, they have burned incense to vanity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13-15</a>).<p>"The virgin of Israel" means here and elsewhere the spiritual church, for this the Israelites represented; "the horrible thing that they did" means that they turned the goods of the church into evils, and the truths of the church into falsities, and from these evils and falsities worshiped Jehovah. The evils from which is such worship are signified by "My people have forgotten Me," for he who forgets God is in evils; and the falsities from which is such worship are signified by "they have burned incense to vanity," "vanity" meaning falsity, and "to burn incense" worship; "shall the snow of Lebanon from the rock leave My fields?" signifies, have they not the truths of the church from the Word? "rock" here signifies the Word, because it signifies Divine truth (as above); "the snow of Lebanon" signifies the truths of the church therefrom. Here "snow" has a similar signification as water, namely, truths, but "snow" signifies cold truths, because a cold church is here treated of. "Lebanon" means the church from which these are, and "fields" mean all goods and truths of the church; "the strange cold waters flowing down," signify the falsities in which there is no good; "strange waters" meaning falsities, and "cold" meaning in which there is no good, for truths have all their heat from the good of love.</p><p>[29] In the same:<p>Behold, I am against thee, thou inhabitant of the valley, thou rock of the plain; that say, Who shall descend against us, and who shall enter into our abodes? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_21_13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>).<p>"The inhabitant of the valley" and "the rock of the plain" signify those who are in the ultimates of the Word, and do not permit themselves to be illustrated from the interior; and such do not see truths, but falsities instead; for all the light of truth, because it is out of heaven from the Lord, comes from the interior and descends. Such are meant by "the inhabitant of the valley" and "the rock of the plain;" "valley" and "plain" meaning the ultimates of the Word in which they are; and "inhabitant" and "rock" signifying falsities, "inhabitant" the falsity of life, and "rock" the falsity of doctrine. The belief in falsity and evil in which such are firmly fixed, believing falsity and evil to be truths and goods, is signified by their saying, "Who shall descend against us, and who shall enter into our abodes?"</p><p>[30] In Isaiah:<p>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for the dread of Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_10.htm">Isaiah 2:10</a>).<p>"To enter into the rock" means into falsity, and "to hide themselves in the dust" means in evil. This treats of the Last Judgment, when those who are in the falsities of evil and in the evils of falsity cast themselves into the hells which are in the rocks and under the lands in the spiritual world. (But these things may be seen more fully brought out and explained in the preceding article.) In Job:<p>The mountain falling passeth away, and the rock is removed out of its place (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_14_18.htm">Job 14:18</a>).<p>"Mountain" signifies the love of evil; and "rock" the belief of falsity; and "to melt away" and "be removed out of its place" signifies to perish.</p><p>[31] In David:<p>Let their judges be cast down by the sides of the cliff (<a href="../ae/410.htm">410</a>.)</p><p>[32] These things have been adduced to make known that "rock" in the contrary sense signifies falsity in general; and this signification of "rock" is from correspondence, as can be seen from the appearances and phenomena in the spiritual world, where all dwell according to the correspondences of the interiors of their mind and life. Consequently those who are in wisdom and intelligence, because they are in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor, and thence in the spiritual affection of truth, dwell upon mountains and hills of earth, where there are paradises, gardens, rose-beds, and lawns; but those who are in the belief in the doctrinals of their church and in some degree of charity, dwell upon rocks where there are level places upon which are some groves and some trees and grassy places; while those who have been in faith alone, as it is called, in respect to doctrine and life, and thence in falsities of faith and evils of life, dwell within the rocks, in caverns and cells there.</p><p>[33] This signification of "rock" is from the correspondence spoken of. But there is a signification of "rock" from its hardness, as in the following passages.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>They have made their faces harder than a rock (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>As an adamant stronger than rock have I made thy forehead; fear not (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_9.htm">Ezekiel 3:9</a>).<p>In Job:<p>They shall be graven with an iron pen and with lead in the rock forevermore (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_19_24.htm">Job 19:24</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>The hoofs of the horses are accounted as rock (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>).<p>Hardness is expressed by "rock" from the correspondence of rock with truth from good, for truth from good has all power, as has been said above; but when truth acts against falsity from evil then good is blunted, and truth then remaining acts with hardness, according to the above words in Ezekiel, "As an adamant stronger than rock have I made thy forehead." Truth without good is also hard, but still is easily broken. But what has been here adduced respecting rocks will be more fully elucidated by what will be said hereafter respecting the signification of stones.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "for I trust;" Hebrew "that trusteth."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "thou wast seen;" for Chaldean "thou sawest," which is also found in Appendix 2.<br><br>3.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "I would feed," but Hebrew has "He would feed."

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 411 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>411. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_16" target=_top>16</a>.) "Et dicebant montibus et patris, Cadite super nos. "Quod significet obtectionem a malis et a falsis inde, constat ex significatione "montium", quod sint mala ex amoribus sui et mundi scaturientia (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_405" target=_top>405</a>(g-i)) et ex significatione "petrarum", quod sint falsa ex malo (de qua infra); et ex significatione "cadere super nos", quod sit ab illis obtegi. Etiam haec illustranda sunt ex talibus quae in mundo spirituali existunt quando ultimum judicium est, nam haec dicta Sunt de ultimo judicio, ut patet ex Sequente versu, ubi dicitur, "Quia venit dies magnus irae Ejus, et quis potest stare?" per quem diem intelligitur tempus et status ultimi judicii. Status impiorum tunc est talis ut dejiciant se e montibus et petris, super quibus habitationes suas fecerunt, in inferna profunde secundum atrocitatem malorum et falsorum apud illos; et hoc faciunt ipsi quia non sustinent Divinum Bonum ac Divinum Verum. Aperiuntur tunc caeli superiores, e quibus influit lux caeli, quae est Divinum Verum unitum Divino Bono: ex hac luce constringuntur simulata bona et vera quae apud illos; quibus constrictis aperiuntur mala et falsa eorum; et quia haec et illa non sustinere possunt lucem caeli, anguntur enim et cruciantur ex illa, ideo conjiciunt se a montibus et petris in inferna profunde secundum quale mali et falsi sui, quidam in hiatus et speluncas, quidam in foramina et petras, quae tunc stant coram illis aperta; et postquam illuc se conjecerunt, clauduntur aperturae. Hoc modo fit ejectio malorum spirituum ex montibus et collibus, quos occupaverunt (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a>(a), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_392" target=_top>392</a>(a), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394" target=_top>394</a> <sup>1</sup></p><p>). Quando in speluncis et in petris sunt, tunc cessant angores et cruciatus quos ab influxu lucis caeli sustinuerunt, nam quies illis est in suis malis et inde falsis, quia haec illis jucunda fuerunt; jucunda enim vitae unumquemvis manent post mortem; jucunda vitae sunt jucunda amorum illorum, nam omne jucundum vitae est amoris:<p>[2] inde constare potest quid significatur per quod "dicant montibus et petris ut cadant super illos "; similiter quid significatur apud Hoscheam,<p>"Dicent montibus, Operite nos; et collibus, Cadite super nos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_10_8" target=_top>Hoscheam 10:8</a>);<p>et apud Lucam,<p>"Tunc incipient dicere montibus, Cadite super nos; et collibus, Occultate nos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_23_30" target=_top>Lucam23:30</a>):<p>ibi etiam agitur de ultimo judicio. Lux caeli, quae est Divinum Verum unitum Divino Bono, a cujus influxu et praesentia anguntur et cruciantur mali qui se dejiciunt, intelligitur per verba mox sequentia in hoc versu, "Abscondite nos a facie Sedentis super throno et ab ira Agni": "ira Agni" dicitur, quia cruciantur; verum cruciatus eorum non est inde, sed ex malis amorum et ex falsis fidei eorum. Haec quia formarunt omnia interiora mentis eorum, nam cujusvis mens formatur ex amore suo et inde fide usque ut sit instar ejus in forma, et quia interiora mentis illorum qui in malis et inde falsis sunt versa sunt in partem contrariam seu in plagam oppositam bonis et veris Divinis, ideo cum Divinum Verum influit, et conatur retroagere interiora quae mentis eorum, et per id adducere illos in caelum, hoc enim Divinum Verum procedens a Domino ubique facit ubi influit, et illi non volunt recedere a suorum amorum jucundis, inde illis angores et cruciatus, qui cessant cum veniunt in inferna ubi similia jucunda seu similes amores regnant.<p>[3] Quoniam supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_405" target=_top>405</a>) ostensum est quid "montes" et "colles" significant, ideo in nunc sequentibus ostendetur quid "petrae"; quod nempe significent verum ex bono spirituali ac verum et bonum fidei, at in opposito sensu falsum fidei. <p>Quod "petrae" significent illa, est quoque ex apparentiis in mundo spirituali; apparent enim ibi petrae et rupes, sicut apparent montes et colles, ut supra ostensum est; et super petris ibi habitant qui in veris ex bono spirituali sunt et qui in vero et bono fidei. Sed differunt montes et colles a petris et rupibus ibi in eo, quod montes et colles sint ex humo, petrae autem et rupes ex saxo; humus enim correspondet bono amoris et inde significat illud, saxum autem correspondet vero fidei et inde significat illud. Et quia pleraque in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum habent, ita etiam "petrae", et in eo sensu significant falsum fidei, et hoc quoque ex correspondentia; nam qui in falsis fidei sunt, habitant intra petras in cavernis ibi.<p>[4] Quod "petra" significet verum ex bono, ac verum fidei, et in supremo sensu Dominum quoad illa, constat ex sequentibus locis:<p>Apud Danielem,<p>" <sup>2</sup></p><p>Videns fuisti usque dum excisus est Lapis, qui non per manus, et percussit statuam super pedes ejus, qui ferrum et argilla...; et Lapis qui percussit statuam, factus est in Petram magnam, et implevit totam terram" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_2_34" target=_top>2:34</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_2_35" target=_top>35</a>):<p>haec de statua Nebuchadnezari in somnio visa; quod per "Lapidem", qui "factus in Petram magnam", intelligatur Dominus, ex singulis ibi patet; sed quid praecedentia ibi significant, primum dicetur.

(Quod quatuor ecclesiae fuerint, una post alteram, videatur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_247" target=_top>247</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_248" target=_top>248</a>.) Per "Lapidem" qui percussit statuam intelligitur Divinum Verum a Domino; quod ille "factus sit in Petram magnam, et impleverit totam terram", significat quod Dominus per Divinum Verum dominaturus sit super caelum et ecclesiam; "terra" ibi est ecclesia et quoque caelum: quare etiam dicitur quod regnum hoc "in aeternum stabit" (vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_2_44" target=_top>44</a>); per "regnum" etiam significatur ecclesia et caelum, ibi enim est regnum Dei.

Quare illi qui in sapientia et intelligentia sunt quia in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum, et inde in affectione veri spirituali, habitant super montibus et collibus ex humo, ubi paradisi, horti, roseta et vireta; at qui in fide doctrinalium suae ecclesiae sunt et in aliqua charitate, illi habitant super petris, ubi campi, super quibus aliqua arbusta et aliquae arbores, ac graminosa; qui autem in sola fide, ut dicitur, quoad doctrinam et quoad vitam fuerunt, et inde in falsis fidei et malis vitae, illi habitant intra petras, in cavernis et cellis ibi.</p><p>[33] Haec significatio "petrae" est ex dicta correspondentia.
