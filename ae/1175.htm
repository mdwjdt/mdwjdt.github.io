<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1175</h4><p>1175. And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning.- That this signifies grief, and confession that by a life according to that religion and its doctrine they were damned, is evident from the signification of casting dust upon their heads, which denotes mourning on account of damnation. - That this is on account of life according to that religion and its doctrine, follows as a consequence; - and from the signification of crying out, weeping and mourning, which denotes a state of grief on account of those things, to cry out having reference to doctrine, while to weep and mourn signify grief of soul and heart, as above (n. <a href="../ae/1164.htm">1164</a>). The reason why casting dust upon the head denotes mourning on account of damnation, is, because by dust is signified what is damned, and head the man himself. Dust signifies what is damned, because the hells are beneath and the heavens above; and from the hells an exhalation of falsity from evil arises perpetually, consequently the dust over them signifies what is damned, concerning which see also above (n. <a href="../ae/742.htm">742</a>). On account of this signification of dust it was usual in the representative church to cast dust upon the head, when any one had committed evil, and repented, for by that means they testified their repentance.</p><p>[2] That this was the case is evident from the following passages.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"They shall cry out bitterly and shall cast dust upon their heads, they shall roll themselves in ashes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_30.htm">27:30</a>);<p>by casting dust upon their heads is signified mourning on account of damnation; and by rolling themselves in ashes is signified mourning yet deeper; for ashes signify what is damned, because the fire that produces them signifies infernal love.<p>In Lamentations:<p>"They sit upon the earth, the elders of the daughter of Zion keep silence, they have cast up dust upon their heads, the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_10.htm">2:10</a>).<p>These things represented a state of grief and mourning, because of evils and falsities - of which they repented - and thus confession that they were accursed. The daughter of Zion signifies the church, and the virgins of Jerusalem signify the truths of doctrine. To sit upon the earth and keep silence signifies grief of mind; to cast up dust upon the head signifies confession that they were accursed, and to hang down the head to the earth, signifies confession that they were in hell.<p>In Job:<p>The friends of Job "rent their garments, and scattered dust upon their heads towards heaven" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_12.htm">2:12</a>).<p>To scatter dust upon the head towards heaven signifies mourning, because Job appeared to be accursed. Mourning on account of the curse of evil is signified by dust upon the head, while by rending the garments is signified mourning on account of the curse of falsity. The signification of rolling themselves in the dust, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>, is similar.<p>That penitence was similarly represented, is clear also from Job:<p>"I repent upon dust and upon ashes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_42_6.htm">42:6</a>).<p>Since dust signifies damnation, it was therefore said to the serpent,<p>"Upon thy belly shalt thou walk, and dust thou shalt eat, all the days of thy life" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>).<p>The serpent signifies infernal evil with those who pervert the truths of the Word, and by that means artfully and craftily deceive. Similarly in Isaiah:<p>"Dust shall be the serpent's bread" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">65:25</a>).<p>It is evident from these things that dust signifies what is accursed; and that to cast dust upon the head means to testify to damnation.</p><p>[3] Continuation.- These things having been stated, an explanation shall be given of the nature of affection, and afterwards why man is led of the Lord by means of affections and not by means of thoughts, and lastly it shall be shown that a man cannot be saved in any other way.<p>1. . What is the nature of affection. The meaning of affection is similar to that of love, but love is, as it were, the fountain, and affections are, as it were, the streams which flow from it; they are thus also continuations of it. Love is like a fountain in man's will; his affections, which are its streams, flow by continuity into his understanding, and there by means of light from truths they produce thoughts, precisely as the influences of heat in a garden cause germinations by means of the rays of light. Love also, in its origin, is the heat of heaven, truths in their origin are the rays of the light of heaven, and thoughts are germinations from their union. From such a union spring all the societies of heaven, which are innumerable, and which in their essence are affections; for they are from the heat which is love, and from the wisdom which is light proceeding from the Lord as a sun. For this reason, those societies, in proportion as the heat in them is united to the light, and the light is united to the heat, are affections for good and truth. This is the origin of the thoughts of all who are in those societies. From this it is evident, that the societies of heaven are not thoughts, but affections; that, consequently, to be led by these societies is to be led by affections, or to be led by affections is to be led by societies, and therefore in what now follows, instead of societies the term affections shall be applied.</p><p>[4] 2. . It shall now be shown why man is led of the Lord by means of his affections, and not by means of his thoughts. While man is led of the Lord by means of his affections, he is capable of being led according to all the laws of the Lord's Divine Providence; but not if he is led by means of his thoughts. Affections do not manifest themselves before a man, but thoughts do; affections again produce thoughts, but thoughts do not produce affections; it appears as if thoughts had this power, but it is a fallacy. And since affections produce thoughts, they also produce everything belonging to man, because they constitute his life. This is also well known in the world. For if you retain a man in his own affection, you have him in bonds, and can lead him where you please, and, in this case, one reason goes as far as a thousand; but if you do not retain him in his own affection, reasons are of no avail; for his affection, not being in harmony with these, perverts, rejects, or destroys them. The case would be similar if the Lord were to lead man by means of his thoughts immediately, and not by means of his affections. Also, when a man is led of the Lord by means of his affections, it appears to him as if he thought freely from himself, and as if he also spoke and acted in the same way. Hence, it is, that the Lord does not teach man without the use of means, but by the employment of them, such as the Word, doctrines, and preaching from the Word, and conversation, and intercourse with others; for from these things man thinks freely as if from himself.</p><p>[5] 3. . That man can be saved in no other way, follows both from what has been said concerning the laws of the Divine Providence, and also from this fact, that thoughts do not give rise to affections in man. For if man knew the whole contents of the Word, and everything of doctrine, even to the arcana of wisdom which the angels possess, and moreover thought and spoke of them, while his affections were still concupiscences of evil, it would not nevertheless be possible for him to be led out of hell by the Lord. It is therefore evident, that if man were taught from heaven by influx into his thoughts, it would be like casting seed upon the highway, or into water, upon snow, or into fire. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1175</h4><p>1175. Verse 19. And they cast dust upon their heads and cried out weeping, and mourning, signifies grief and confession that by a life according to that religious persuasion and its doctrine they were condemned. This is evident from the signification of "to cast dust upon the head," as being to mourn because they were condemned (it follows as a consequence that it was on account of life according to that religious persuasion and its doctrine); also from the signification of "to cry out weeping and mourning," as being grief that they were condemned by such a life, "to cry out" having reference to doctrine, and "to weep and mourn" signifying grief of soul and heart (as above, n. <a href="../ae/1164.htm">1164</a>. "To cast dust upon the heads" means mourning on account of condemnation, because "dust" signifies what is condemned, and "head" the man himself. "Dust" signifies what is condemned, because the hells are beneath and the heavens are above, and from the hells falsity from evil unceasingly breathes forth, consequently the dust over them signifies what is condemned (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/742.htm">742</a>. Because of this signification of "dust" it was a custom in the representative churches to cast dust upon their heads when they had done evil and had repented of it, thus giving proof of their repentance.</p><p>[2] That this was so can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>They shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall roll themselves in ashes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>).<p>"To cast up dust upon their heads" signifies mourning because of condemnation, and "to roll themselves in ashes" signifies still deeper mourning, for "ashes" signify what is condemned, because the fire from which they come signifies infernal love. In Lamentations:<p>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the earth, they keep silence, they have cast up dust upon their heads; the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>).<p>By such things grief and mourning because of evils and falsities of which they repented, and thus confession that they were condemned, were represented. "Daughter of Zion" signifies the church, and "virgins of Jerusalem" signify truths of doctrine; "to sit upon the earth and keep silence" signifies grief of mind; "to cast dust upon the head" signifies confession that they were condemned, and "to hang down the head to the earth" signifies confession that they were in hell. In Job:<p>The friends of Job rent everyone his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_2_12.htm">Job 2:12</a>).<p>"To sprinkle dust upon the head towards heaven" signifies mourning on account of Job, who seemed to be condemned. Mourning on account of condemnation of evil is signified by "dust upon the head," and "rending the mantle" signifies mourning on account of condemnation of falsity. The same is signified by:<p>Rolling themselves in the dust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>).<p>That repentance was thus represented is evident in Job:<p>I repent upon dust and upon ashes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_42_6.htm">Job 42:6</a>).<p>Because "dust" signifies condemnation, it was said to the serpent:<p>Upon the belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>).<p>The "serpent" signifies infernal evil with those who pervert the truths of the Word, and thereby deceive artfully and craftily. So in Isaiah:<p>Dust shall be the serpent's bread (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>).<p>From all this it is clear that "dust" signifies what is condemned, and that "to cast dust upon the head" is a testification of condemnation.<p>(Continuation)</p><p>[3] All this having been premised it shall now be told what affection is, and afterwards why man is led by the Lord by means of affections and not by means of thoughts, and lastly that man can be saved in no other way.<p>What affection is. The same is meant by affection as by love. But love is like a fountain and affections are like the streams therefrom, thus affections are continuations of love. Love as a fountain is in the will of man; affections, which are streams from it, flow by continuity into the understanding, and there by means of light from truths produce thoughts, just as the influences of heat in a garden produce germinations by means of rays of light. Moreover, love in its origin is the heat of heaven, and truths in their origin are the rays of light of heaven, and thoughts are germinations from their marriage.<p>From such a marriage are all the societies of heaven, which are innumerable, which in their essence are affections; for they are from the heat that is love and from the wisdom that is light from the Lord as a sun. Therefore these societies, as heat in them is united to light, and light is united to heat, are affections of good and truth. From this are the thoughts of all in these societies. This makes clear that the societies of heaven are not thoughts but affections, consequently to be led by means of these societies is to be led by means of affections, that is, to be led by means of affections is to be led by means of societies; and for this reason in what now follows the term affections will be used in place of societies.</p><p>[4] Why man is led by the Lord by means of affections and not by means of thoughts shall now be told. When man is led by the Lord by means of affections he can be led according to all the laws of His Divine providence, but not if he should be led by means of thoughts. Affections do not become evident to man, but thoughts do; also affections produce thoughts, but thoughts do not produce affections; there is an appearance that they do, but it is a fallacy. And when affections produce thoughts they produce all things of man, because these constitute his life. Moreover, this is known in the world. If you hold a man in his affection you hold him bound, and lead him wherever you please, and a single reason is then stronger than a thousand. But if you do not hold man in his affection reasons are of no avail, for his affection, when not in harmony with them, either perverts them or rejects them or extinguishes them. It would be similar if the Lord should lead man by means of thoughts immediately, and not by means of affections.<p>Again, when a man is led by the Lord by means of affections, it seems to him as if he thought freely as if of himself, and spoke freely and acted freely as if of himself. And this is why the Lord does not teach man immediately, but mediately by means of the Word, and by means of doctrines and preachings from the Word, and by means of conversations and interaction with others; for from these things man thinks freely as if of himself.</p><p>[5] In no other way can man be saved. This follows both from what has been said about the laws of the Divine providence and also from this, that thoughts do not produce affections in man. For if man knew all things of the Word, and all things of doctrine, even to the arcana of wisdom that the angels possess, and thought and spoke about them, so long as his affections were lusts of evil he could not be brought out of hell by the Lord. Evidently, then, if man were to be taught from heaven by an influx into his thoughts it would be like casting seed upon the way, or into water, or into snow, or into fire. </p>

In Threnis,<p>"Sedent in terra, conticescunt seniores filiae Zionis, ascendere fecerunt pulverem super caput suum, .... descendere fecerunt in terram caput..virgines Hierosolymae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1175/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_2_10" target=_top>2:10</a>):<p>per talia repraesentabatur dolor et luctus propter mala et falsa, a quibus paenitentiam agerent, ita confessio quod damnati sint: "filia Zionis" significat ecclesiam, et "virgines Hiersoloymae" significant vera doctrinae; "sedere super terra", et "conticescere", significat dolorem animi, et "ascendere facere pulverem super capita" significat confessionem quod damnati sint, et "descendere facere caput in terram" significat confessionem quod in inferno sint.<p>Apud Hiobum,<p>Amici Hiobi "sciderunt tunicam suam et sparserunt pulverem super capita sua versus caelum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1175/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_2_12" target=_top>2:12</a>);<p>per "spargere pulverem super capita versus caelum", significatur luctus propter Hiobum, qui visus sicut damnatus; luctus propter damnationem mali, significatur per "pulverem super caput" et per "scindere tunicam" significatur luctus propter damnationem falsi. Simile significatur per<p>Volutare se in pulvere (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1175/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_micah_1_10" target=_top>Micham 1:10</a>).<p>Quod paenitentia per id repraesentaretur, apud Hiobum,<p>"Paenitentiam ago super pulvere et super cinere" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1175/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_42_6" target=_top>42:6</a>).<p>Quoniam "pulvis" significabat damnationem, ideo dictum est ad serpentem,<p>"Super ventre tuo ambulabis, et pulverem comedes omnibus diebus vitae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1175/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_14" target=_top>Genesis 3:14</a>):<p>per "serpentem" significatur malum infernale apud illos qui pervertunt vera Verbi, et per id astute et dolose decipiunt. Similiter apud Esaiam,<p>"Serpentis panis pulvis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1175/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_65_25" target=_top>65:25</a>).<p>Ex his patet quod "pulvis" sit damnatum; et quod "mittere pulverem super caput" sit testari damnationem.<p>[3] (Continuatio.)<p>His praemissis nunc dicetur quid Affectio, et deinde cur homo a Domino ducitur per affectiones, et non per cogitationes, et demum quod homo aliter non salvari possit.<p>Quid Affectio. – Per affectionem intelligitur simile quod per amorem; sed amor est sicut fons, et affectiones sunt sicut rivi inde, ita quoque sunt continua ejus. Amor ut fons est in voluntate hominis: affectiones quae sunt rivi ejus, per continuum fluunt in intellectum, et ibi media luce ex veris producunt cogitationes; prorsus sicut afflatus caloris in horto producunt germinationes mediis radiis lucis; amor etiam in sua origine est calor caeli, vera in sua origine sunt radii lucis caeli, et cogitationes sunt germinationes ex conjugio illorum. Ex tali conjugio sunt omnes societates caeli, quae innumerabiles sunt, quae in sua essentia sunt affectiones; sunt enim ex calore qui est amor, et ex sapientia quae est lux, ex Domino ut Sole; inde illae societates, sicut ibi calor unitus et luci, et lux unita est calori, sunt affectiones boni et veri: inde sunt cogitationes omnium in illis societatibus. Ex hoc patet quod societates caeli non sint cogitationes, sed quod sint affectiones; consequenter quod duci per societates illas sit duci per affectiones, seu duci per affectiones sit duci per societates; quare in nunc sequentibus pro societatibus dicentur affectiones.<p>[4] Nunc dicetur, Cur homo a Domino ducitur per affectiones et non per cogitationes. – Dum homo per affectiones a Domino ducitur, potest ille secundum omnes leges Divinae providentiae Ipsius duci, non autem si per cogitationes; affectiones non se manifestant coram homine, sed cogitationes manifestant: tum affectiones producunt cogitationes, sed cogitationes non producunt affectiones; apparet sicut producant, sed est fallacia; et cum affectiones producunt cogitationes, etiam producunt omnia hominis, quia vita ejus sunt illae. Hoc etiam notum est in mundo: si tenes hominem in sua affectione, tenes illum vinctum, et ducis quovis, et tunc una ratio valet pro mille; at si non tenes hominem in sua affectione, non valent rationes, affectio enim non concors vel pervertit illas, vel rejicit illas, vel exstinguit illas. Simile foret si Dominus duceret hominem per cogitationes immediate, et non per affectiones. Etiam cum homo ducitur a Domino per affectiones, apparet illi sicut ex se libere cogitet, et sicut ex se libere loquatur, et quoque agat. Inde nunc est quod Dominus non immediate doceat hominem, sed mediate per Verbum, per doctrinas et praedicationes ex Verbo, per loquelas et consortia, ex his enim homo cogitat libere sicut ex se.<p>[5] Quod homo non aliter salvari possit, sequitur tam ex illis quae de legibus Divinae providentiae dicta sunt, quam ex his, quod cogitationes non producant affectiones apud hominem; si enim homo sciret omnia Verbi, et omnia doctrinarum, usque ad arcana sapientiae quae sunt angelis, ac cogitaret et loqueretur illa, at affectiones ejus forent concupiscentiae mali, usque non potuisset a Domino educi ex inferno. Inde patet quod si homo doceretur e caelo per influxum in cogitationes ejus, foret sicut qui projicit semen in viam, vel in aquas, vel in nivem, vel in ignem. </p>
