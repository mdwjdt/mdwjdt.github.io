<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 652</h4><p>652. And their bodies [are] upon the street of the great city.- That this signifies their extinction by evils and falsities of doctrine, is evident from the signification of bodies, as denoting that the good of love and the truth of doctrine, signified by the two witnesses, were extinguished; for to be killed signifies to be extinguished, in this case spiritually, because with those who have altogether destroyed those things in themselves. Similarly it is said concerning the Lord that He is slain and dead, which signifies that the Divine proceeding from Him, which is the Divine Good and Divine Truth, is rejected; thus the Lord, with those by whom it is rejected, is slain and dead, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/83.htm">83</a>); and from the signification of the street of the great city, as denoting the truth and good of doctrine, and, in the opposite sense, the falsity and evil of doctrine. For by street is signified, in a good sense, truth leading and, in the opposite sense, falsity leading, of which we shall speak presently, and by city is signified doctrine, concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>). It is said "the great city," because great is said of good, and, in the opposite sense, of evil; and many is said of truth, and, in the opposite sense, of falsity, as may be seen above (n. 223, [336], 337). From these things it is now evident that by the bodies of the two witnesses upon the street of the great city is signified the extinction of the good of love and of charity, and of the truth of doctrine and of faith, by falsities and evils of doctrine. Because evils and falsities of doctrine are signified, these words follow, "which great city is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt," and by Sodom are signified evils of the love, and by Egypt falsities thence, each of these pertaining to doctrine, which destroy the church at its end, concerning which we shall speak further in the articles that follow.</p><p>[2] The reason why street signifies the truth of doctrine, and, in the opposite sense, its falsity, is, that way in the spiritual sense signifies truth leading to good, and, in the opposite sense, falsity leading to evil, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/97.htm">97</a>); and streets are ways in a city. And because city signifies doctrine, therefore by street is signified the truth and falsity of doctrine. In the spiritual world also there are cities, and streets in them as in the cities of the world; and the quality of every one as to the affection for truth and thence intelligence is known merely from the places where they dwell, and also from the streets in which they walk. Those who are in a clear perception of truth dwell in the southern quarter of the city, and also walk there; those who are in a clear affection for the good of love dwell in the eastern quarter, and also walk there; those who are in an obscure affection for the good of love dwell in the western quarter, and also walk there; and those who are in an obscure perception of truth dwell in the northern quarter, and also walk there; but it is the contrary in the cities where those have their abode who are in the persuasion of falsity from evil. From these things it is evident whence it is that street signifies truth or falsity leading.</p><p>[3] That such things are signified by streets is evident from the following passages.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Run ye through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, I pray, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man that doeth judgment, seeking truth; then will I pardon her" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">5:1</a>).<p>Since the streets in Jerusalem, and the broad places thereof, signify truths of doctrine, according to the states of the affection and perception of those who are of the church, and as by Jerusalem is signified the church as to doctrine, therefore it is said, "Run ye through the streets of Jerusalem, and see and know, and seek in the broad places thereof." And since judgment is said of truths, because all judgment is effected from laws and precepts, which are truths, and because by truth is signified the truth of doctrine and of faith, therefore it is said, "If ye can find a man that doeth judgment and that seeketh truth." The broad places specifically signify the corners of the city, thus the quarters where they dwell; and because every one dwells in the cities in the spiritual world according to clear and obscure affection for good and perception of truth, therefore by broad places are signified truths and goods according to every one's affection and perception.</p><p>[4] In Isaiah:<p>"Judgment hath been driven back, and justice stood afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the street, and rectitude cannot enter" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_14.htm">59:14</a>).<p>By judgment and justice, in the Word, are signified truth and good; that these are no longer is signified by judgment being driven back and justice standing afar off, that they wandered from the truths of doctrine, and that thence there was no truth in the life, which is good of life, is signified by, truth hath stumbled in the street, and rectitude cannot enter. For all of the good of life is procured by means of truths of doctrine, as man learns from these how he ought to live. Because street signifies where truth leads, therefore it is said, truth hath stumbled in the street.</p><p>[5] In Nahum:<p>The chariots raged in the streets, they ran in the broad places (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_2_4.htm">2:4</a>).<p>Because chariots signify doctrinals of truth, and streets and broad places, according to every one's affection and perception, as above, therefore it is said, "The chariots raged in the streets, they ran in the broad places"; to rage signifies, to call falsities truths, and to run signifies to wander.</p><p>[6] In the book of Judges:<p>"In the days of Jael the ways ceased, they that go in paths went crooked ways, they ceased, the broad places in Israel ceased" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_6.htm">5:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_7.htm">7</a>).<p>These words are in the song of Deborah and Barak, in which the desolation of truth in the church is treated of, and afterwards its restitution; the desolation is described by the words, "The ways ceased, they that go in paths went crooked ways, the broad places in Israel ceased." Ways and paths have a similar signification to streets and broad places, namely, truths of doctrine leading; and to go crooked ways signifies wandering from truths.</p><p>[7] In Isaiah:<p>"The city of emptiness shall be broken down, every house shall be shut that no one may enter; there shall be a cry over wine in the streets, all joy shall be mingled together; the gladness of the earth shall be banished" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_10.htm">24:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_11.htm">11</a>).<p>By the city of emptiness is signified doctrine in which there is no truth but falsity; by house is signified good of the will and thence of the life. It is therefore evident what is signified by the city of emptiness shall be broken down, every house shall be shut that no one may enter. By a cry over wine in the streets is signified lamentation on account of the defect of truth and of the intermingling of it with falsity, wine signifying the truth of the church from the Word; therefore it is said, "in the streets," because a street also signifies truth, and where truth is sought. Joy and gladness are named, because joy is said of delight from the affection for good, and gladness of the delight from the affection for truth; that those delights will cease is signified by, all joy shall be mingled together, the gladness of the earth shall be banished, earth denoting the church.</p><p>[8] Again in Jeremiah:<p>"How is the city of glory [not] forsaken, the city of my joy wherefore the young men shall fall in the streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_25.htm">49:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_30.htm">50:30</a>.).<p>The city of glory signifies the doctrine of Divine Truth, and the city of joy signifies delight from affection for good and truth therein; by the young men are signified those that have become intelligent through truths and that the understanding of truth would perish is signified by, the young men shall fall in the streets. By the men of war are signified truths combating against falsities; and that there would be no defence of truth against falsities is signified by, all the men of war shall be cut off.</p><p>[9] Again in Ezekiel:<p>"Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, so that you have filled the streets thereof with the slain" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_6.htm">11:6</a>).<p>The slain, in the Word, mean those who perish by falsities, for the sword with which they are slain signifies falsity destroying truth; the city signifies here, as above, the doctrine of truth; the signification of the slain in the city is therefore evident. By filling the streets with the slain is signified the devastation of truth by falsities.</p><p>[10] In Lamentations:<p>"They that did eat delicacies are devastated in the streets; and they that were brought up in crimson (purpura) have embraced dunghills. The form" of the Nazarites "is darker than blackness, they are not known in the streets. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood. They have hunted our steps so that we cannot go in the streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_5.htm">4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_18.htm">18</a>).<p>Streets here also signify truths of doctrine leading to the good of life, or truths according to which the life is to be formed. This treats of the church where the Word is, and its devastation as to truths; therefore they that did eat delicacies are devastated in the streets signifies that those who have imbibed genuine truths from the Word have no longer any truths, delicacies denoting genuine truths from the Word. By they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills is signified that those who received genuine goods from the Word have nothing but falsities of evil, crimson denoting the genuine good of the Word, specifically the celestial love for truth, and dunghills signifying falsities of evil. By the form of the Nazarites is darker than blackness, they are not known in the streets, is signified that Divine Truth is in such obscurity that it does not appear to any one; for the Nazarites represented the Lord as to Divine Truth, therefore they signify Divine Truth from the Lord. By they wandered as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, is signified that the truths of the Word are no more seen, because they are falsified, the blind signifying those who do not see truths. By they have hunted our steps, so that we cannot go in the streets, is signified to lead astray, so that it is not known how to live, to hunt the steps denoting to lead astray by means of falsities, and to go denoting to live, therefore to go in the streets signifies to live according to truths.</p><p>[11] In Zephaniah:<p>"I will cut off the nations; their corners shall be devastated; I will lay waste their streets, that none shall pass through; their cities shall be devastated, that there shall be no man (vir), and no inhabitant" (<a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>). The streets which shall be desolate, that no one shall pass through, signify truths of doctrine; for the cities which shall be devastated, that there shall be no man and no inhabitant, signify doctrinals, while man and inhabitants, in the spiritual sense of the Word, mean all who are in truths and in goods, thus, in an abstract sense, truths and goods.</p><p>[12] In Zechariah:<p>"I will return to Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, whence Jerusalem, shall be called the city of truth; old men and women shall yet dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and the streets shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_3.htm">8:3-5</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the coming of the Lord, and concerning a new church to be established by Him. Zion means the church as to the good of love, and Jerusalem the church as to the truths of doctrine, therefore Jerusalem is called the city of truth. By the old men and women who shall dwell in the streets of Jerusalem are meant those that are intelligent and wise by means of truths of doctrine; by the boys and girls playing in the streets, with whom the streets of the city shall be filled, are signified affections for truth and good and their delights, in which those shall abound who live in truths of doctrine.</p><p>[13] In Jeremiah:<p>"According to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal" (<a href="../ae/324.htm">324</a>, <a href="../ae/491.htm">491</a>, <a href="../ae/492.htm">492</a>, <a href="../ae/567.htm">567</a>).</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>"Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? the sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, the women knead the mass to make cakes to the queen of the heavens, at the same time to pour out drink-offerings to other gods; I will cause to cease in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness" (<a href="../ae/555.htm">555:17</a>); and that the cities of Judah signify the doctrinals of the church, and the streets of Jerusalem the truths of its doctrine.</p><p>[15] Again:<p>"Have ye forgotten the evils which they did in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_9.htm">44:9</a>).<p>The land of Judah signifies the church as to good, here as to evil; and the streets of Jerusalem signify the truths of doctrine, here the falsities of its doctrine.</p><p>[16] In Ezekiel:<p>"With the hoofs of his horses shall" Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, "tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and he shall bring down the statues of strength to the earth; they shall plunder thy wealth" (<a href="../ae/236.htm">236</a>).</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>"Thou hast built thee a lofty place, and thou hast made thee a high place in every street; upon every head of the way thou hast made thee thy lofty place, and thou hast made thy beauty abominable" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_24.htm">16:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_31.htm">31</a>).<p>High and lofty places, with the ancients, signified heaven, whence came the rite of sacrificing upon high mountains, and instead of these upon lofty structures, therefore worship from evils and falsities of doctrine is signified by making a lofty and high place in every street, and upon every head of the way. And because that worship became idolatrous, it is said that they made their beauty abominable; by beauty is meant truth and intelligence thence, for every one in the spiritual world is beautiful according to truths from good, and intelligence thence.</p><p>[18] In Amos:<p>"In all the streets shall be wailing and in all the broad places they shall say, Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_16.htm">5:16</a>).<p>In all the streets mourning, and in all the broad places they shall say, Alas, alas! signifies grief on account of truth and good everywhere devastated; and they shall call the husbandman to mourning signifies the grief of the men of the church on account thereof, husbandman signifies the man of the church, because a field signifies the church as to the implantation of truth.</p><p>[19] Again in David:<p>"Our garners are full, yielding from food to food, our flocks are thousands and ten thousands in our streets; our oxen are laden, no breach or fleeing away, or outcry in our broad places" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_13.htm">Psalm 144:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_14.htm">14</a>).<p>The garners full of food signify doctrinals from the Word, thus the Word where are all the truths of doctrine from which are instruction and spiritual nourishment. By the flocks being thousands and ten thousands in the streets are signified spiritual goods and truths; by thousands of flocks goods, and by ten thousands truths; by oxen laden are signified natural goods and their affections; by no breach is signified their coherence. By none fleeing away is signified no loss of any; by no outcry in the broad places is signified no lamentation anywhere over the want of them.</p><p>[20] In Job:<p>God "who giveth rain upon the faces of the earth, and who sendeth waters upon the faces of the streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_5_10.htm">5:10</a>).<p>To give rain upon the faces of the earth signifies the influx of Divine Truth into all things with those who are of the church; and to send waters upon the faces of the streets signifies the Divine influx into truths of doctrine in order to render man spiritual by means of them.</p><p>[21] In Isaiah:<p>"In her streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth, upon her roofs and in her streets he shall howl, going down into weeping" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_3.htm">15:3</a>).<p>The things are said of the city of Ar in the land of Moab, by which is signified the doctrine of those who are in truths from the natural man; grief over the falsities of their doctrine, from primaries to ultimates, is signified by girding on sackcloth, and by howling upon the roofs and in the streets, roofs denoting interior things, and streets exterior things with them.</p><p>[22] In Jeremiah:<p>"Upon all the roofs of Moab, and in the streets thereof, a general lamentation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_38.htm">48:38</a>).<p>Similar things are here signified as by those above.<p>In Daniel:<p>"Know and perceive from the going forth of the word even to restoring and building of Jerusalem, unto Messiah the Prince, [seven weeks]; after sixty and two weeks the street and ditch shall be restored and built, but in straitness of times" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_25.htm">9:25</a>).<p>He who is not acquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word may suppose that by Jerusalem is here signified Jerusalem, and that this is to be restored and built; also that by the street and ditch, of which it is likewise said that it shall be restored and built, is understood the street and ditch of that city. But by Jerusalem is meant the church which will be established by the Lord, and by the street and ditch is meant the truth of doctrine; by street truth, and by ditch doctrine. This is not the place to explain the signification of the number of weeks.</p><p>[23] From these considerations it is now evident that the signification of the street of the New Jerusalem in the following passages in the Apocalypse is similar:<p>"The twelve gates were twelve pearls, and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_21.htm">21:21</a>);<p>and afterwards:<p>"He shewed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb; in the midst of the street thereof and of the river, on either side, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_2.htm">2</a>):<p>but these passages will be explained hereafter.</p><p>[24] In Isaiah:<p>"Thy sons have fainted, they have lain at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_20.htm">51:20</a>).<p>These things also are said of Jerusalem, that is, of the church vastated as to doctrine. Sons mean those who are in truths of doctrine; to faint and to lie at the head of all the streets signifies to be deprived of all truth, the head or beginning of the streets denoting the entrance to truth, consequently all truth.</p><p>[25] In Lamentations:<p>"The infant and suckling faint in the streets of the city; lift up thy hands to" the Lord "over the souls of thine infants, who have fainted through hunger at the head of all the streets" (<a href="../ae/386.htm">386</a>).</p><p>[26] In Nahum:<p>"Her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets, and over her honourable ones they cast lots, and all her great men were bound in chains" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_3_10.htm">3:10</a>).<p>Infants, here also mean truths which are first born and vivified; and by being dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets is signified to be dispersed and to perish. By the honourable ones are signified the goods of love; by casting lots over them is signified to be dissipated; by great men are signified the truths of good; and by being bound in chains is signified to be bound by falsities, so that truths cannot come forth. These things are said concerning the city of bloods, which signifies doctrine in which the truths of the Word are falsified.</p><p>[27] In Jeremiah:<p>"Death is come up through our windows, it is come into our palaces, to cut off the infant from the street, the young men from the broad places" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_21.htm">9:21</a>).<p>Death here means spiritual death, which takes place when falsity is believed to be truth, and the truth to be falsity; and the life is according to such belief. Windows signify thoughts from the understanding; palaces the interior and thence more sublime things of the human mind (mens); the signification of death ascending through the windows and coming into the palaces is therefore evident. Infant signifies here, as above, the truths which are first born through knowledges from the Word; the young men signify truths acquired, from which comes intelligence; while streets and broad places signify truths of doctrine and truths of life, which lead to intelligence and wisdom. The signification therefore of cutting off the infant from the street, the young men from the broad places, is evident.</p><p>[28] In the same:<p>"I am full of the anger of Jehovah, I am weary with holding in; pour out upon the infant in the street, and upon the assembly of young men; for even the man (vir) with the woman shall be taken, the old man with him that is full of days" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_11.htm">6:11</a>).<p>Here by the infant in the street and by the young men similar things to those above are signified. Man and woman signify truth conjoined to good and thence intelligence, and by the old man and him that is full of days is signified wisdom.</p><p>[29] Since street signifies the truth of doctrine leading, and, in the opposite sense, falsity, therefore in the following passages mire of the streets, dirt and dung, signify falsity of the love of evil.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Their carcase has become dung of the streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_25.htm">5:25</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"He shall make him a treading down like the mire of the streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_10_6.htm">10:6</a>).<p>In Micah:<p>"She shall be for a treading down like the mire of the streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_7_10.htm">7:10</a>).<p>In David:<p>"I will beat them small as the dust before the faces of the wind, like the dirt of the streets I will spread them out" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_42.htm">Psalm 18:42</a>).<p>These things are also from appearances in the spiritual world; in the cities there in which falsities from evil reign, the streets appear full of dung, dirt, and mire. It is evident from these things what is signified by "The Lord commanding the seventy, whom he sent to preach the Gospel, into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof, and say, Even the dust of your city, that cleaveth unto us, do we shake off against you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_10.htm">Luke 10:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_11.htm">11</a>).</p><p>[30] Because the streets of a city signify truths of doctrine, according to which man should live, therefore it was customary to teach and to pray in the streets.<p>Thus in the Second Book of Samuel:<p>"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest peradventure the daughters of the Philistines rejoice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_20.htm">1:20</a>).<p>In Matthew:<p>"When thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the broad places, that they may have glory of men. And if thou pray thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, where they may be seen of men" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_2.htm">6:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>"Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets; but he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_26.htm">13:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_27.htm">27</a>).</p><p>[31] From the signification of street, as denoting the truth of doctrine, it is also clear why the Lord said in the parable that the householder commanded his servants, that they should go quickly into the streets and broad places of the city, and bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>).<p>The poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind, do not mean such in a natural sense, but such in a spiritual sense, namely, those who, not having the Word, were in ignorance of truth, and therefore in want of good, but who still desired truths by means of which they might attain to good; such were the nations of whom the church of the Lord was afterwards established.</p><p>[32] Since the street of a city signified truth as well as falsity teaching and leading, therefore the angels who came to Sodom, said that they would tarry all night in the street (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_19_2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>). And therefore, also, it was commanded that if the sons of Israel observed that those in any city served other gods, they should smite the inhabitants of the city with the sword, utterly destroying the city, and that they should bring all the spoil of it into the midst of the street, and burn the city and all the spoil with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_14.htm">Deuteronomy 13:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_17.htm">17</a>). By other gods are signified the falsities of worship; by the sword, the destruction of falsity by truths; by the spoil, the falsification of truth; and by fire, the punishment of the love of evil and its destruction.</p><p>[33] From these passages cited from the Word it is evident what is signified by the bodies of the two witnesses being cast upon the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, and afterwards by their not being permitted to be laid in the tombs. For it was a custom with the Jewish and Israelitish nation to cast out their enemies that were slain into the ways and streets, and not to bury them, as a sign of their hatred; but this represented that they were infernal evils and falsities which could not be raised again to life, that is, those who were in evils and falsities.</p><p>[34] This is also evident in Jeremiah:<p>The prophets prophesy, saying, "Sword and famine shall not be in this land; by the sword and famine shall these prophets be consumed, and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there shall be none to bury them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_15.htm">14:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">16</a>).<p>A prophet means the doctrine of truth, but here the doctrine of falsity, because they prophesied falsities and because streets signified where falsities are, therefore it is said that they shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 652</h4><p>652. Verse 8. And their bodies shall be upon the street of the great city, signifies their extinction by the evils and falsities of doctrine. This is evident from the signification of "bodies" as being that the good of love and the truth of doctrine signified by "the two witnesses" have been extinguished; for "to be killed" signifies to be extinguished, here spiritually, because it refers to those who have wholly destroyed these things in themselves. In like manner the Lord is said "to have been slain" and "to be dead," to signify that the Divine proceeding from Him, which is Divine good and Divine truth, has been rejected, that is, the Lord has been slain and is dead with those by whom that has been rejected (See above, n. <a href="../ae/83.htm">83</a>). This is evident also from the signification of "the street of the great city," as being the truth and good of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the falsity and evil of doctrine; for "street" signifies truth leading, and in the contrary sense falsity leading (of which presently); and "city" signifies doctrine (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>. It is said "great city," because "great" is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, as "many" is predicated of truth, and in the contrary sense of falsity (See above, n. <a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>, <a href="../ae/336.htm">336</a>, <a href="../ae/337.htm">337</a>). This now makes clear that "the bodies of the two witnesses upon the street of the great city" signifies the extinction of the good of love and charity and of the truth of doctrine and faith by the falsities and evils of doctrine. As the evils and falsities of doctrine are signified, it is next said "which great city is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt," "Sodom" signifying the evils of the love, and "Egypt" the falsities therefrom, each pertaining to doctrine, by which the church at its end is destroyed (concerning which in the following articles).</p><p>[2] "Street" signifies the truth of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the falsity of doctrine, because in the spiritual sense a "way" signifies truth leading to good, and in the contrary sense falsity leading to evil (See above, n. <a href="../ae/97.htm">97</a>); and streets are ways in a city, and as a "city" signifies doctrine, so a "street" signifies the truth and the falsity of doctrine. Moreover, in the spiritual world there are cities, and streets in them, as in the cities of the world; and what each one is in respect to the affection of truth and intelligence therefrom is known there merely from the place where he dwells and from the streets in which he walks. Those who are in a clear perception of truth dwell in the southern quarter of the city and also walk there; those who are in a clear affection of the good of love dwell in the eastern quarter and also walk there; those who are in an obscure affection of the good of love dwell in the western quarter and also walk there; and those who are in an obscure perception of truth dwell in the northern quarter and also walk there. But in the cities where those live who are in the persuasion of falsity from evil the reverse is true. This makes clear why it is that a "street" signifies truth or falsity leading.</p><p>[3] That "streets" have this signification can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah:<p>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, I pray, and know, and seek in the open places thereof if ye can find a man that doeth judgment, that seeketh truth; then will I pardon her (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>).<p>Because "the streets of Jerusalem and the open places thereof" signify the truths of doctrine, according to the states of affection and perception of those who are of the church, and because "Jerusalem" signifies the church in respect to doctrine it is said, "Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see and know, and seek in the open places thereof;" and because "judgment" is predicated of truths, since all judgment comes from laws and precepts, which are truths, and because "truth" signifies the truth of doctrine and of faith it is said, "if ye can find a man that doeth judgment and that seeketh truth."<p>The "open places" mean particularly the corners of the city, thus the quarters where the dwelling places are; and as each one in the cities in the spiritual world has his dwelling place in accordance with his affection of good and his perception of truth, clear or obscure, therefore "open places" signify truths and goods according to each one's affection and perception.</p><p>[4] In Isaiah:<p>Judgment hath been rejected backward, and justice hath stood afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the street, and rectitude cannot enter (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>).<p>"Judgment and justice" signify in the Word truth and good; that these no longer exist is signified by "judgment hath been rejected backward, and justice has stood afar off;" that they have wandered away from the truths of doctrine, and consequently there is no truth in the life, which is the good of life, is signified by "truth hath stumbled in the street, and rectitude cannot enter," for all good of life is acquired by means of the truths of doctrine, for it is by them that a man learns how he ought to live. Because "street" signifies where truth leads, it is said "truth hath stumbled in the street."</p><p>[5] In Nahum:<p>The chariots raged in the street, they ran to and fro in the open places (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_2_4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>).<p>Because "chariots" signify the doctrinals of truth, and "streets" and "open places" what is in accord with each one's affection and perception, as above, it is said "the chariots raged in the streets, they ran to and fro in the open places," "to rage" signifying to call falsities truths, and "to run to and fro" signifying to wander off.</p><p>[6] In the book of Judges:<p>In the days of Jael the ways ceased, they that go in footpaths went in crooked paths, they ceased, the open places ceased in Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_7.htm">7</a>).<p>This is in the Song of Deborah and Barak, which treats of the desolation of truth in the church, and afterwards of its restoration; the desolation is described by "the ways ceased, they that go in footpaths went in crooked paths, they ceased, the open places ceased in Israel;" "ways and paths" having the same signification as "streets and open places," namely, truths of doctrine leading, and "to go in crooked ways" signifies to wander away from truths.</p><p>[7] In Isaiah:<p>The city of emptiness shall be broken down, every house shall be shut that no one may enter; a cry over the wine in the streets; every joy shall be mixed, the gladness of the earth shall be banished (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_10.htm">Isaiah 24:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_11.htm">11</a>).<p>"The city of emptiness" signifies doctrine in which there is falsity and no truth; "house" signifies the good of the will and thus of the life; thence is evident what is signified by "the city of emptiness shall be broken down, every house shall be shut that no one may enter;" "a cry over the wine in the streets" signifies lamentation on account of the lack of truth and the mingling of truth with falsity, "wine" signifying the truth of the church from the Word; therefore it is said "in the streets," because "street" too signifies truth, and where truth is sought. "Joy and gladness" are mentioned, because "joy" is predicated of the delight that is from the affection of good, and "gladness" of the delight that is from the affection of truth; that these delights will cease is signified by "every joy shall be mixed, the gladness of the earth shall be banished," the earth signifying the church.</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>How is the city of glory forsaken, the city of my joy! Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_30.htm">50:30</a>).<p>"The city of glory" signifies the doctrine of Divine truth, and "the city of joy" signifies the delight from the affection of good and truth therein; "young men" signify those who are made intelligent by means of truths; and that the understanding of truth would perish is signified by "the young men shall fall in the streets;" "men of war" signify truths combating against falsities; that there will be no defense of truth against falsities is signified by "all the men of war shall be cut off."</p><p>[9] In Ezekiel:<p>You have multiplied your slain in this city, so that you have filled the streets thereof with the slain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>).<p>The "slain" mean in the Word those who are destroyed by falsities; for the "sword," by which they are slain, signifies falsity destroying truth; "city" signifies here, as above, the doctrine of truth; thence appears what is signified by "the slain in the city;" "to fill the streets with the slain" signifies to lay waste the truth by falsities.</p><p>[10] In Lamentations:<p>They that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets; and they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills. The form of the Nazirites is darker than blackness, they are not recognized in the streets. They have wandered about blind in the streets, they are polluted with blood. They have hunted our steps so that we cannot go in the streets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_18.htm">18</a>).<p>Here, too, "streets" signify the truths of doctrine leading to the good of life, or truths according to which one must live. This treats of the church where the Word is, and its devastation in respect to truths; therefore "they that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets" signifies that those who have imbibed genuine truths from the Word have no longer any truths, "delicacies" meaning genuine truths from the Word; "they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills" signifies that those who had imbibed genuine goods from the Word have nothing but the falsities of evil, "crimson" signifying the genuine good of the Word, in particular the celestial love of truth, and "dunghills" signifying the falsities of evil; "the form of the Nazirites is darker than blackness, they are not recognized in the streets," signifies that Divine truth is in such obscurity that it is apparent to no one; "the Nazirites" represent the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and therefore signify Divine truth from the Lord; "they have wandered about blind in the streets, they are polluted with blood," signifies that the truths of the Word are no longer seen because they have been falsified, "the blind" signifying those who do not see truths. "They have hunted our steps, so that we cannot go in the streets," signifies leading astray, so that it is not known how to live, "to hunt the steps" signifying to lead astray by falsities, and "to go" signifying to live, therefore "to go in the streets" signifies to live according to truths.</p><p>[11] In Zephaniah:<p>I will cut off the nations, their corners shall be laid waste; I will make desolate their streets, that none may pass through; their cities shall be laid waste, that there may be no man nor inhabitant (<a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>; the "streets that shall be made desolate, that no one may pass through," signify the truths of doctrine; for the "cities that shall be laid waste, that there may be no man nor inhabitant," signify doctrinals, "man" and "inhabitants" meaning in the Word in the spiritual sense all who are in truths and goods, thus in an abstract sense, truths and goods.</p><p>[12] In Zechariah:<p>I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, whence Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth. There shall yet old men and women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and the streets shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_3.htm">Zechariah 8:3-5</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord's coming, and of the New Church to be established by Him; "Zion" means the church in respect to the good of love, and "Jerusalem" the church in respect to the truths of doctrine, therefore Jerusalem is called "the city of truth;" "the old men and women who shall dwell in the streets of Jerusalem" mean those that are intelligent and wise through the truths of doctrine; "the boys and girls playing in the streets, of whom the streets of the city shall be full," signify the affections of truth and good and their delights, in which those shall abound who live in the truths of doctrine.</p><p>[13] In Jeremiah:<p>According to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal (<a href="../ae/324.htm">324</a>, <a href="../ae/491.htm">491</a>, <a href="../ae/492.htm">492</a>, <a href="../ae/567.htm">567</a>.)</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The sons gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire, the women knead dough to make cakes to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods; I will make to cease in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness (<a href="../ae/555.htm">555</a>; also that "the cities of Judah" signify the doctrinals of the church, and "the streets of Jerusalem" its truths of doctrine.</p><p>[15] In the same:<p>Have ye forgotten the evils which they did in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a>)<p>"The land of Judah" signifies the church in respect to good, but here in respect to evil; and "the streets of Jerusalem" signify the truths of doctrine, but here its falsities of doctrine.</p><p>[16] In Ezekiel:<p>With the hoofs of his horses Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall trample down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and he shall bring down the pillars of strength to the earth; they shall make a spoil of thy wealth (<a href="../ae/236.htm">236</a>.)</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>Thou hast built thee an eminent place and hast made thee an exalted place in every street, upon every head of the way thou hast made thee thy eminent place, and thou hast made thy beauty abominable (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_24.htm">Ezekiel 16:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_31.htm">31</a>).<p>"Eminent place" and "exalted place" with the ancients signified heaven; from this came the practice of sacrificing upon high mountains, or in place of these upon places built up high, therefore worship from evils and from the falsities of doctrine is signified by "making an eminent and an exalted place in every street, and upon every head of the way;" and as that worship became idolatrous it is said that "they made their beauty abominable," "beauty" meaning truth and intelligence therefrom; for everyone in the spiritual world is beautiful according to truths from good, and intelligence therefrom.</p><p>[18] In Amos:<p>Lamentations shall be in all the streets, and they shall say in all the open places, Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>).<p>"Lamentations shall be in all the streets, and they shall say in all the open places, Alas, alas!" signifies grief because truth and good are everywhere laid waste; "and they shall call the husbandman to mourning" signifies the grief of the men of the church on this account, "husbandman" signifying the man of the church, because a "field" signifies the church in respect to the implantation of truth.</p><p>[19] In David:<p>Our garners are full, affording food on food; our flocks are thousands and ten thousands in our streets; our oxen are laden, there is no breach nor fleeing away, nor outcry in our open places (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_13.htm">Psalms 144:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_14.htm">14</a>).<p>"Garners which are full of food" signify the doctrinals from the Word, thus the Word itself, wherein are all truths of doctrine which furnish instruction and spiritual nourishment; "flocks are thousands and ten thousands in the streets" signifies spiritual goods and truths, "thousands of flocks" goods, and "ten thousands" truths; "oxen laden" signify natural goods and their affections; "no breach" signifies their coherence; "no fleeing away" signifies no loss of any of these; "no outcry in the open places" signifies no lamentation anywhere over the lack of these.</p><p>[20] In Job:<p>God, who giveth rain upon the faces of the earth, and who sendeth waters upon the faces of the streets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_5_10.htm">Job 5:10</a>).<p>"To give rain upon the faces of the earth" signifies the influx of Divine truth into all things with those who are of the church; and "to send waters upon the faces of the streets" signifies Divine influx into the truths of doctrine, that man may be rendered spiritual thereby.</p><p>[21] In Isaiah:<p>In its streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth, upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl, flowing down in weeping (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>).<p>This is said of the city Ar in the land of Moab, which signifies the doctrine of those who are in truths from the natural man; grief over their falsities of doctrine, from the first to the last, is signified by "they have girded themselves with sackcloth, upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl," "roofs" meaning interior things, and "streets" exterior things with such. In Jeremiah:<p>Upon all the roofs of Moab and in its streets, lamentation everywhere (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_38.htm">Jeremiah 48:38</a>).<p>The signification here is similar, as above.</p><p>[22] In Daniel:<p>Know and perceive that from the going forth of the Word even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, even to Messiah the prince; after sixty and two weeks it shall be restored and built, street and ditch, but in straitness of times (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>).<p>He who knows not the spiritual sense of the Word may think that by "Jerusalem" here Jerusalem is meant, and that it is to be restored and built; also that "the street and ditch" which it is said will be restored and built mean a street and ditch of that city; but "Jerusalem" means the church that is to be established by the Lord, and "street and ditch" mean the truth of doctrine; "street" truth, and "ditch" doctrine. What is there signified by the number of weeks is not to be explained in this place.</p><p>[23] This makes evident that "the street of the New Jerusalem" has a like signification in the following passages in Revelation:<p>The twelve gates were twelve pearls and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<p>And afterwards:<p>He showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb; in the midst of the street thereof and of the river on either side was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_2.htm">2</a>).<p>But these passages will be explained hereafter.</p><p>[24] In Isaiah:<p>Thy sons have fainted, they lay at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_20.htm">Isaiah 51:20</a>).<p>This, too, is said of Jerusalem, that is, the church vastated in respect to doctrine, "sons" meaning those who are in the truths of doctrine; "to faint and to lie at the head of all the streets" signifies to be deprived of all truth, "head or beginning of the streets" signifying entrance to truth, thus all truth.</p><p>[25] In Lamentations:<p>The infant and the suckling faint in the streets of the city. Lift up thy hands to the Lord respecting the souls of thine infants, who have fainted from famine at the head of all the streets (<a href="../ae/386.htm">386</a>).</p><p>[26] In Nahum:<p>Her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets, and over her honorable ones they cast a lot, and all her great ones were bound with chains (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_3_10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>).<p>Here also "infants" mean the truths that are firstborn and vivified, and "to be dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets" signifies to be scattered and to perish; "honorable ones" signify the goods of love; "to cast a lot over them" signifies dispersion of these; "great ones" signify the truths of good; and "to be bound with chains" signifies to be tied by falsities so that truth cannot come forth. This is said of "the city of bloods" which signifies the doctrine in which the truths of the Word are falsified.</p><p>[27] In Jeremiah:<p>Death cometh up through our windows, it cometh into our palaces, to cut off the infant from the street, the young men from the open places (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_21.htm">Jeremiah 9:21</a>).<p>"Death" means here spiritual death, which takes place when falsity is believed to be truth and truth to be falsity, and the life is in accordance therewith; "windows" signify the thoughts from the understanding, "palaces" the interior and thus the more sublime things of the human mind; this makes clear what is signified by "death cometh up through the windows and cometh into our palaces;" "infant" signifies here as above the truths that are firstborn through knowledges from the Word; "young men" signify truths acquired, from which comes intelligence; and "streets and open places" signify the truths of doctrine and the truths of life which lead to intelligence and wisdom; this makes clear what is signified by "cutting off the infant from the street, the young men from the open places."</p><p>[28] In the same:<p>I am full of the anger of Jehovah, I am weary with holding in; pour out upon the infant in the street, and upon the assembly of young men; for even the man with the woman shall be taken, the old man with him that is full of days (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>).<p>Here "the infant in the street" and "the young men" have a similar signification as above; "man [vir] and woman" signify truth conjoined to good and intelligence therefrom; and "old man" and "one full of days" signify wisdom.</p><p>[29] As "street" signifies the truth of doctrine leading, and in the contrary sense falsity, "the clay of the streets," "the mire," and "dung" signify the falsity of the love of evil, in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Their carcass has become as the dung of the streets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>).<p>He shall make him to be trodden down like the clay of the streets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_10_6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>).<p>In Micah:<p>She shall be trodden down like the mire of the streets (Mic. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_7_10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>).<p>In David:<p>I will beat them small as the dust before the faces of the wind, I will spread them out as the mire of the streets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_42.htm">Psalms 18:42</a>).<p>All this, too, is from the appearances in the spiritual world; in the cities there in which falsities from evil reign the streets appear full of dung, mire and clay. This makes evident what is signified by:<p>The Lord's commanding the seventy whom He sent out to preach the Gospel, Into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, Even the dust of your city that cleaveth unto us do we shake off from us <sup>1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_10.htm">Luke 10:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_11.htm">11</a>).</p><p>[30] Because "the streets of a city" signify the truths of doctrine, according to which one should live, it was customary to teach and to pray in the streets. Thus in the second book of Samuel:<p>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>).<p>In Matthew:<p>When thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the open places that they may have glory of men. And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets where they may be seen of men (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>Then shall ye begin to say, We did eat before Thee and drink, and Thou didst teach in our streets; but He shall say, I tell you I know you not whence ye are (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_27.htm">27</a>).</p><p>[31] Furthermore, from the signification of "street," as meaning the truth of doctrine, it is also evident why the Lord said in the parable that:<p>The master of the house commanded his servants to go out quickly into the streets and open places of the city and bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_21.htm">Luke 14:21</a>).<p>"The poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind," do not mean such in a natural sense, but such in a spiritual sense, that is, such as had not the Word, and were therefore in ignorance of truth and in lack of good, but still desired truths by means of which they might obtain good; such were the Gentiles with whom the church of the Lord was afterwards established.</p><p>[32] Because "the street of a city" signified either truth or falsity teaching and leading, therefore:<p>The angels that came to Sodom said that they would lodge all night in the street (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_19_2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>).<p>And for the same reason it was commanded that:<p>If the sons of Israel observed that those in any city served other gods they should smite the inhabitants of the city with the sword, utterly destroying the city, and they should bring all the spoil of it into the midst of the street, and burn the city and all the spoil with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_14.htm">Deuteronomy 13:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_17.htm">17</a>).<p>"Other gods" signify the falsities of worship, "the sword" the destruction of falsities by truths; "spoil" the falsification of truth; and "fire" the punishment of the love of evil and its destruction.</p><p>[33] From these passages cited from the Word it can be seen what is signified by "the bodies of the two witnesses were cast forth upon the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt," and afterwards that "they were not suffered to be placed in sepulchers;" for it was a custom with the Jewish and Israelitish nation to cast out the slain that were enemies into the ways and streets, and not to bury them, as a sign of their hatred of such; but still this represented that by such enemies infernal evils and falsities that could not be raised again to life were meant, that is, those who were in infernal evils and falsities.</p><p>[34] This is evident in Jeremiah:<p>The prophets prophesy, saying, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; by sword and by famine shall these prophets be consumed, and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there shall be no one to bury them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_15.htm">Jeremiah 14:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">16</a>).<p>A "prophet" means the doctrine of truth, here the doctrine of falsity, because they prophesied falsities; and as "streets" signified where falsities are, it is said that "they were to be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Greek has "against you." </p>
