<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 303</h4><p>303. Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? That this signifies whether any one there is of such a quality as to know and perceive the states of the life of all, is evident from the signification of, Who is worthy? as denoting, who has merit and justice, and who has omniscience, thus whether there are any of such a quality. That by worthy, when said of the Lord, merit and justice are signified; these belong to Him alone, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/293.htm">293</a>). And that omniscience is signified is evident from what follows, where it is said, that the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, and opened it; for by the right hand is signified omniscience and omnipotence, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>); from the signification of the book, as denoting the state of the life of all in general and in particular (concerning which see just above, n. <a href="../ae/299.htm">299</a>); and from the signification of opening it and loosing the seals thereof, as denoting to know and perceive. For when a book signifies the states of the life of all, then to open and to loose the seals signifies to know and perceive the same; for to know and perceive are said of the state of the life, but to open and loose the seals are said of a book. Thus the words, in the internal sense, are accommodated to the things signified by the words in the sense of the letter, for they correspond; therefore, to open signifies to know, and to loose the seals signifies to perceive what is entirely hidden from others (as above, n. <a href="../ae/300.htm">300</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 303</h4><p>303. Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? signifies, is there anyone there such as to know and to perceive the states of life of all? This is evident from the signification of "Who is worthy?" as being, is there anyone who has merit and righteousness, and who has omniscience, thus whether there is any such? That "worthy," in reference to the Lord, signifies merit and righteousness, which belong to Him alone, see above n. <a href="../ae/293.htm">293</a>. And that omniscience is signified is clear from what follows, where it is said, "the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, and opened it;" for "right hand" signifies omniscience and omnipotence (See above, n. <a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>); it is evident also from the signification of the "book," as being the states of life of all in general and in particular (of which see just above, n. <a href="../ae/299.htm">299</a>); and also from the signification of "to open the book and to loose the seals thereof," as being to know and perceive; for when the "book" signifies the states of life of all, "to open and to loose the seals" signifies to know and perceive those states; for knowing and perceiving are predicated of the state of life, but opening and loosening seals relate to a book; thus the words in the internal sense conform to the things signified by the words in the sense of the letter, for they correspond; therefore, "to open" signifies to know, and "to loose the seals" signifies to perceive what is altogether hidden from others (as above, n. <a href="../ae/300.htm">300</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 303 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>303. "Quis est dignus aperire librum et solvere sigilla ejus?" - Quod significet num ullus ibi talis est ut sciat et percipiat status vitae omnium, constat ex significatione "Quis est dignus?" quod sit cui meritum et justitia, et cui omniscientia, ita num ullus talis sit. Quod per "dignum", cum de Domino, significetur meritum et justitia, quae Ipsi soli, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_303/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_293" target=_top>293</a>); et quod omniscientia, patet a sequentibus, ubi dicitur quod "Agnus acceperit a dextra Sedentis super throno librum, et aperuerit illum "; per "dextram" enim significatur omniscientia et omnipotentia (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_303/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297" target=_top>297</a>): ex significatione "libri", quod sit status vitae omnium in communi et in particulari (de qua mox supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_303/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_299" target=_top>299</a>); et ex significatione "aperire illum et solvere sigilla ejus", quod sit scire et percipere; nam cum "liber" significat status vitae omnium, tunc "aperire et solvere sigilla", significat scire et percipere illos, scire enim et percipere praedicatur de statu vitae, at aperire et solvere sigilla de libro; ita verba in sensu interno accommodantur rebus quae significantur per verba in sensu litterae, correspondent namque; quare "aperire" significat scire, ac "solvere sigilla" significat percipere quae aliis prorsus recondita sunt (ut supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_303/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_300" target=_top>300</a>). </p>
