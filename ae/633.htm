<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 633</h4><p>633. Forty and two months.- That this signifies even to the end of the old church, and the beginning of the new, is evident from the signification of months as denoting states, in this case the states of the church; for times, whether hours, days, months, years, or ages, signify states, and such states are designated by the numbers by which those times are determined, as in this case by the number forty-two (concerning this see above, n. <a href="../ae/571.htm">571</a>, <a href="../ae/610.htm">610</a>); and from the signification of forty-two as denoting the end of the former and the beginning of a new church. The reason this number has such a signification is, that it means six weeks, and by six weeks is signified the same as by six days of one week, that is, a state of combat and labour, consequently the end, when the church is altogether vastated, or when evil is consummated; and by the seventh week, which then follows, is signified the beginning of a new church. For the number forty-two results from the multiplication of six into seven, six times seven being forty-two, therefore it signifies the same as six weeks, and six weeks the same as six days of one week, that is, a state of combat and labour, as stated, and also a full state, in the present case, a full consummation of good and truth, or a complete vastation of the church.</p><p>[2] In the Word mention is frequently made of forty days, months, and years, and that number there signifies either a complete vastation of the church, or also a full state of temptation. That this state is signified by the numbers forty and forty-two, is evident from the following passages.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>Egypt "shall not be inhabited forty years; I will make Egypt a solitude in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and her cities in the midst of the cities that are devastated shall be a solitude forty years; and I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and I will scatter them in the lands; at the end of forty years I will gather Egypt together from the peoples, whither they were dispersed, and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_11.htm">29:11-14</a>)<p>Egypt signifies the church as to truths scientific (vera scientifica) upon which doctrine is founded. Truths scientific at that time were the knowledges (scientiae) of correspondences and representations, upon which the doctrine of their church was founded. But because the Egyptians turned those knowledges into magic, and by that means perverted the church, therefore its vastation, meant by forty years, is described. This, then, is the signification of Egypt not being inhabited forty years, and its cities being a solitude forty years. By Egypt being dispersed among the nations, and scattered in the lands, is signified that evils and falsities would completely take possession of that church and pervert all its scientifics. It is therefore evident that by forty years is signified the state of its complete vastation, or even to its end, when there would be no longer any truth and good remaining. But the beginning of a new church, signified by the end of forty years, is meant by these words, "at the end of forty years I will gather Egypt together from the peoples whither they were dispersed, and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt."</p><p>[3] In the same prophet there is a similar signification in the command<p>"that he should lie on his right side forty days, and lay siege to Jerusalem," which "shall want bread and water, and shall be desolate a man and a brother and waste away for their iniquity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_6.htm">4:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_17.htm">17</a>).<p>The complete vastation of the church is also signified by that number; by Jerusalem is signified the church; by laying siege to it is signified to bring it into distress by evils and falses; by wanting bread and water is signified to be vastated as to the good of love and as to the truth of doctrine; by a man and a brother being desolate, and wasting away for their iniquity, things of a similar kind are signified, for a man and a brother denote truth and charity, and to waste away denotes to die.</p><p>[4] The forty days of the flood have a similar signification in Genesis:<p>"For yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy all substance, which I have made, from upon the faces of the earth; and there was rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights"; then "after seven days, he sent out a dove, which did not return unto him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_7_4.htm">7:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_7_12.htm">12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_8_6.htm">8:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_8_13.htm">13</a>).<p>The flood signifies the devastation of the old, or Most Ancient church, also a last judgment upon those who were of that church. By the rain of forty days is signified its destruction by the falsities of evil; but the beginning of a new church is signified by the drying up of the earth after those forty days, and by its germinating anew. The dove which he sent out signifies the good of charity, which was the essential of that church. Concerning these things see the Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained.</p><p>[5] From this signification of the number forty originated this law in Moses, That the wicked man shall be smitten with forty stripes, and not more, "lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_25_3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>). Full punishment as well as vastation is described by forty, for punishment is equally the consummation of evil. And because after punishment reformation succeeds, therefore it is said that he shall not be smitten with more stripes, "lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes"; for forty signifies the end of evil and also the beginning of good, therefore if more than forty stripes were given, the beginning of good, or reformation, would not be signified.</p><p>[6] The vastation of the church with the sons of Jacob by the servitude of four hundred years in Egypt is signified by the words of Jehovah to Abraham,<p>"Know thou that thy seed shall be a sojourner in a land not theirs, where they shall make them serve four hundred years" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p>The signification of four hundred is similar to that of forty, also the signification of a thousand is similar to that of a hundred, of a hundred to that of ten.</p><p>[7] The vastation of the church, and also full temptation, are also signified by the sons of Israel remaining forty years in the wilderness, of which it is thus written in the following passages:<p>"Your sons shall be feeding in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, even until your carcases are consumed in the wilderness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_34.htm">34</a>):<p>"He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that did evil in the eyes of Jehovah was consumed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_32_13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>):<p>"Jehovah hath known thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years, Jehovah thy God was with thee, that thou lackedst nothing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_2_7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>):<p>"Thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to afflict thee, and to tempt thee; he fed thee with manna to afflict thee, to tempt thee, and that he might do thee good at the last" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_16.htm">16</a>):<p>"Your fathers tempted me, they proved me; forty years I loathed in this generation, and I said, they are a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_10.htm">10</a>):<p>"I made you to ascend out of the land of Egypt, and I led you forty years in the wilderness to possess the land of the Amorite" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_10.htm">Amos 2:10</a>).<p>It is evident from what has been stated that by forty years is not only signified the vastation of the church with the sons of Israel, but also a full state of temptation; also that by the end of those years the beginning of a new church is signified. The vastation of the church is described by these words, that they should feed in the wilderness forty years, and bear their whoredoms, until their bodies should be consumed; also by these, until all this a generation, which hath done evil in the eyes of Jehovah, be consumed; also by these, I loathed in this generation, and I said, they are a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways. But the temptation which is also signified by forty years is described by these words: Jehovah thy God was with thee through the forty years, that thou lackedst not any thing; also by these, Jehovah hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to afflict thee, and to tempt thee, and he fed thee with manna; also by these, He led thee in the wilderness to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the last. The beginning of the new church, at the end of the forty years, is described by their introduction into the land of Canaan, which took place after those forty years; and is also meant by the words, to do thee good at the last; also by these, I led you in the wilderness forty years to possess the land of the Amorite.<p>Full temptation is also signified by Moses being upon Mount Sinai forty days and forty nights, during which he neither ate bread nor drank water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_34_28.htm">34:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_25.htm">25</a>); similarly, also, by "Jesus being in the wilderness tempted by the devil, where He fasted forty days" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>:2; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_1.htm">Luke 4:1</a>).</p><p>[8] From this it is evident that the number forty in the Word signifies complete vastation and consummation, that is, when all the good of the church is vastated, and evil consummated. The same number also signifies full temptation, and at the same time the establishment of the church anew, or reformation. From this the signification of the holy city being trodden under foot by the nations forty and two months is evident. And also in the following in the Apocalypse - that to the beast coming up out of the sea "was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and power was given to him forty and two months" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_15.htm">Revelation 13:15</a>). Let no one therefore suppose that by forty and two months are meant months, or that any special time is designated by the numbers mentioned here and in the words that follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 633</h4><p>633. Forty-two months, signifies even to the end of the old church and the beginning of the new. This is evident from the signification of "months," as being states, here the states of the church; for "times," whether hours or days or months or years or ages, signify states, and such states are designated by the numbers by which such times are determined, as here by the number "forty-two" (that this is so, see above, n. <a href="../ae/571.htm">571</a>, <a href="../ae/610.htm">610</a>). This is evident also from the signification of "forty-two" as being the end of the former church and the beginning of the new; this is the signification of that number, because it means six weeks, and "six weeks" has a similar signification as the "six days" of one week, namely, a state of combat and labor, and thus the end when the church is altogether vastated, or when evil is consummated; and "the seventh week" which then follows signifies the beginning of a New Church; for the number "forty-two" arises from the multiplication of six into seven, six times seven making forty-two, therefore "forty-two" has a similar signification as "six weeks," and "six weeks" something similar to the "six days" of one week, namely, a state of combat and labor, as was said, and also a full state, here the full consummation of good and truth, that is, the full vastation of the church.</p><p>[2] In the Word mention is sometimes made of "forty," sometimes days, sometimes months, sometimes years, and that number signifies either the full vastation of the church, or a complete temptation. That this state is signified by the numbers "forty" and "forty-two," can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>Egypt shall not be inhabited forty years; I will make Egypt a solitude in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and her cities in the midst of the cities that are laid waste, they shall be a solitude forty years; and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and will disperse them into the lands. At the end of forty years I will bring together Egypt from the peoples, whither they were scattered, and will bring back the captivity of Egypt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_11.htm">Ezekiel 29:11-14</a>).<p>"Egypt" signifies the church in respect to true knowledges [scientifica], upon which doctrine is based. True knowledges at that time were the knowledges of correspondences and representations, upon which the doctrine of their church was based. But because the Egyptians turned these knowledges into magic, and thus perverted the church, its vastation is described, which is meant by "forty years;" this, therefore, is the signification of "Egypt shall not be inhabited forty years, and her cities shall be a solitude forty years." That "Egypt must be scattered among the nations and dispersed into the lands" signifies that evils and falsities will altogether occupy that church and pervert all its knowledges [scientifica]. This makes clear that "forty years" signifies a state of full vastation of the church, or even to its end, when there will be no more good or truth remaining. But the beginning of a New Church, which is signified by "the end of forty years," is meant by these words, "at the end of forty years I will bring together Egypt from the peoples whither they were scattered, and will bring back the captivity of Egypt."</p><p>[3] In the same prophecy:<p>That the prophet should lie on his right side forty days, and lay siege to Jerusalem, which shall want bread and water, and be desolated, a man and his brother, and pine away for its iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_17.htm">17</a>);<p>has a similar signification. The full vastation of the church is also here signified by that number; "Jerusalem" signifies the church; "to lay siege to it" signifies to distress the church by evils and falsities; "to want bread and water" signifies to be vastated in respect to the good of love and the truth of doctrine; "to be desolated, a man and his brother, and to pine away for iniquity," has a similar signification, for "man and his brother" mean truth and charity, and "to pine away" means to die out.</p><p>[4] The "forty days" of the flood have a similar signification in Genesis:<p>For yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy all substance that I have made from upon the faces of the earth. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights, then after seven days he sent forth a dove, which did not return unto him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_7_4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_7_12.htm">12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_8_6.htm">8:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_8_12.htm">12</a>).<p>The "flood" signifies the devastation of the old or most ancient church, likewise the last judgment upon those who were of that church; "the rain of forty days" signifies the ruin of that church by the falsities of evil; but the beginning of a New Church is signified by the drying up of the earth after those forty days, and by its sprouting up anew; the "dove" that he sent out signifies the good of charity, which was the essential of that church. (But respecting these things see Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained.)</p><p>[5] The law in Moses:<p>That the wicked man might be smitten with forty stripes, and no more lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_25_3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>);<p>originated in this signification of the number "forty." Full punishment as well as vastation is described by "forty," since punishment is equally the consummation of evil; and as reformation follows after punishment, it is said that he should not be smitten with more stripes, "lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes;" for "forty" signifies the end of evil, and also the beginning of good, therefore if he were smitten with more than forty stripes the beginning of good, or reformation, would not be signified.</p><p>[6] The vastation of the church with the sons of Jacob by a servitude of four hundred years in Egypt is signified by the words of Jehovah to Abraham:<p>Know that thy seed shall be a sojourner in a land not theirs, where they shall subject them to servitude four hundred years (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p>"Four hundred" has a similar signification as "forty," just as one "thousand" has a similar signification as one "hundred," and one "hundred" as "ten. "</p><p>[7] The vastation of the church and also full temptation are signified by the tarrying of the sons of Israel forty years in the wilderness, which is thus spoken of in the following passages:<p>Your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms even till your carcasses are consumed <sup>1</sup>in the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_34.htm">34</a>).<p>He made them to wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah was consumed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_32_13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>).<p>Jehovah hath known thy walking through the great wilderness these forty years, Jehovah thy God hath been with thee that thou lackedst nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_2_7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>).<p>Thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and tempt thee; He fed thee with manna; to afflict thee, to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the last (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Your fathers tempted Me, they proved Me; forty years I loathed this generation, and I said, It is a people that do err in heart, and they have not known My ways (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_9.htm">Psalms 95:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_10.htm">10</a>).<p>I have made you to come up out of the land of Egypt, and I have led you in the wilderness forty years to possess the land of the Amorites (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_10.htm">Amos 2:10</a>).<p>From what has been cited it is clear that "forty years" signifies not only the vastation of the church with the sons of Israel, but also full temptation; also "the end of those years" signifies the beginning of a New Church. The vastation of the church is described by these words, that "they should be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and should bear whoredoms, even till their carcasses should be consumed; also by these, "until all this generation that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah was consumed;" also by these, "I loathed this generation, and I said, It is a people that do err in heart, and they have not known My ways." But the temptation that is also signified by "forty years" is described by these words, "Jehovah thy God hath been with thee these forty years, that thou lackedst nothing;" also by these, "Jehovah led thee forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and tempt thee; and He fed thee with manna;" also by these, "He led thee in the wilderness to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the last." The beginning of a New Church, after the end of the forty years, is described by their introduction into the land of Canaan, which took place after these forty years; and this is also meant by these words, "to do thee good at the last;" so also by these, "I have led you in the wilderness forty years to possess the land of the Amorites."</p><p>[8] Full temptation is signified also by:<p>Moses was upon Mount Sinai forty days and forty nights, during which he ate no bread and drank no water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_34_28.htm">34:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_9_25.htm">25</a>).<p>In like manner that Jesus was in the wilderness, tempted by the devil, and fasted there forty days (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_2.htm">2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_1.htm">Luke 4:1</a>).<p>From this it can be seen that the number "forty" in the Word signifies full vastation and consummation, that is, when all the good of the church is vastated and the evil is consummated; also that the same number signifies full temptation, and also the establishment of the church anew, or reformation. From this it can be known what is signified by "the forty-two months during which the nations trampled down the holy city," likewise by the following in Revelation:<p>That there was given to the beast coming up out of the sea a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and there was given to him authority forty-two months (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_5.htm">5</a>).<p>Let no one, therefore, believe that "forty-two months" mean months, or that any time designated by numbers is meant here and in what follows.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin has "consummantur;" <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9437.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9437</a> has "consumta fuerit." </p>

Aegyptum solitudinem in medio terrarum desolatarum, et urbes ejus in medio urbium devastatarum, erunt solitudo quadraginta annis; et dispergam Aegyptum inter gentes, et dejiciam eos in terras:.... a fine quadraginta annorum congregabo Aegyptum ex populis quo dispersi fuerunt, et reducam captivitatem Aegypti" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_29_11-14" target=_top>29:11-14</a>):<p>per "Aegyptum" significatur ecclesia quoad vera scientifica, super quibus fundatur doctrina; vera scientifica eo tempore erant scientiae correspondentiarum et repraesentationum, super quibus fundabatur doctrina ecclesiae eorum; sed quia Aegyptii illas scientias vertebant in magias, et sic pervertebant ecclesiam, ideo vastatio ejus describitur, quae intelligitur per "quadraginta annos"; hoc itaque significatur per quod "Aegyptus non habitabitur quadraginta annis, ac urbes ejus erunt solitudo quadraginta annis": quod "dispergenda esset Aegyptus inter gentes, et disjicienda in terras", significat quod mala et falsa prorsus occupatura sint illam ecclesiam, ac perversura omnia ejus scientifica: inde patet quod per "quadraginta annos" significetur status ejus vastationis plenariae, seu usque ad finem, dum amplius non aliquid verum et bonum residuum futurum sit: initium autem ecclesiae novae, quod significatur per "finem quadraginta annorum", intelligitur per haec verba, "A fine quadraginta annorum congregabo Aegyptum ex populis quo dispersi fuerunt, et reducam captivitatem Aegypti."<p>[3] Simile significatur apud Prophetam eundem, per<p>Quod cubaret a latere dextro quadraginta diebus, et obsideret Hierosolymam, quae "carebit pane et aqua, ac desolabitur vir et frater, et contabescent propter iniquitatem" ( <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_4_6" target=_top>4:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_4_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_4_17" target=_top>17</a>):<p>plenaria vastatio ecclesiae etiam per illum numerum significatur; per "Hierosolymam" significatur ecclesia; per "obsidere illam" significatur angustare malis et falsis; per "carere pane et aqua" significatur vastari quoad bonum amoris et quoad verum doctrinae; per "desolari vir et frater, et contabescere propter iniquitatem" similia significantur, nam "vir et frater" est veritas et charitas, ac "contabescere" est demori.<p>[4] Simile per "quadraginta dies diluvii" significatur in Genesi,<p>"Ad dies adhuc septem Ego pluere faciam super terram quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes, et perdam omnem substantiam, quam feci, a super faciebus terrae:.... et fuit pluvia super terra quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes :".... tunc "post septem dies emisit columbam, quae non redibat ad illum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_7_4" target=_top>7:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_7_12" target=_top>12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_8_6" target=_top>8:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_8_12" target=_top>12</a> <sup>2</sup></p><p>):<p>per "diluvium" significatur devastatio ecclesiae veteris seu Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, tum ultimum judicium super illos qui fuerunt ab ea ecclesia; per "pluviam quadraginta dierum" significatur interitus ejus per falsa mali: at principium ecclesiae novae significatur per "exsiccationem terrae" post illos quadraginta dies, ac per "germinationem e novo"; "columba", quam emisit, significat bonum charitatis, quae illius ecclesiae essentiale erat. (Sed de his videantur Arcana Caelestia, ubi illa explicata sunt.)<p>[5] Ex significatione numeri "quadraginta" ducit causam haec lex apud Mosen,<p>Quod impius quadraginta plagis percutietur, et non plus, "ne vilis habeatur frater tuus in oculis tuis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_25_3" target=_top>Deuteronomius 25:3</a>):<p>punitio plenaria per "quadraginta" aeque describitur sicut vastatio, nam punitio est aeque consummatio mali; et quia post punitionem reformatio succedit, ideo dicitur quod "non pluribus" plagis percutietur, ne vilis habeatur frater in oculis tuis"; nam per "quadraginta" significatur finis mali, et quoque principium boni; quare si pluribus plagis quam quadraginta percuteretur, non significaretur principium boni seu reformatio.<p>[6] Vastatio ecclesiae apud filios Jacobi per quadringentorum annorum servitutem in Aegypto, significatur per Jehovae verba ad Abrahamum,<p>"Scias quod peregrinum erit semen tuum in terra non illorum, ubi servituti subjicient illos.... quadringentis annis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_15_13" target=_top>Genesis 15:13</a>);<p>per "quadringenta" simile significatur quod per "quadraginta", sicut simile per "mille" quod per "centum", ac simile per "centum" quod per "decem."<p>[7] Vastatio ecclesiae, et quoque tentatio plenaria, etiam significatur per "commorationem filiorum Israelis quadraginta annis "in deserto", de qua ita in sequentibus locis:-<p>"Filii vestri erunt pascentes in deserto quadraginta annis, et portabunt scortationes vestras, usque dum <sup>3</sup></p><p>consumantur corpora vestra in deserto" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_14_33" target=_top>Numeri 14:33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_14_34" target=_top>34</a>);<p>"Vagari fecit eos in deserto quadraginta annis, usque dum consumpta est omnis generatio quae fecit malum in oculis Jehovae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_32_13" target=_top>Numeri 32:13</a>);<p>"Jehovah.... cognovit ambulare tuum per desertum magnum his quadraginta annis, Jehovah Deus tuus tecum, ut non destitutus fueris ulla re" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_2_7" target=_top>Deuteronomius 2:7</a>);<p>"Recorderis omnis viae qua duxit te Jehovah Deus tuus his quadraginta annis in deserto, ut affligeret te, et tentaret te;.... cibavit te manna.... ad affligendum te, ad tentandum te, et ad benefaciendum tibi postremo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_8_2" target=_top>Deuteronomius 8:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_8_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_8_15" target=_top>15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_8_16" target=_top>16</a>);<p>"Tentarunt Me patres vestri, probarunt Me;.... quadraginta annis fastidivi in generatione hac, dixique, Populus sunt errantes corde, iidemque non cognoverunt vias meas" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_95_9" target=_top>Psalms 95:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_95_10" target=_top>10</a>);<p>Ego ascendere feci vos e terra Aegypti, et duxi Vos in deserto quadraginta annis ad possidendum terram Emorraei" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_2_10" target=_top>Amos 2:10</a>):<p>ex allatis constat quod per "quadraginta annos" non solum significetur vastatio ecclesiae apud filios Israelis, sed etiam plenaria tentatio; tum per "finem illorum annorum" principium novae ecclesiae. Vastatio ecclesiae describitur per haec: quod "pascerent in deserto quadraginta annis, et portarent scortationes, usque dum consumantur corpora eorum"; tum per haec, "Usque dum consumpta est omnis generatio haec, quae fecit malum in oculis Jehovae"; tum per haec, "Fastidivi in generatione illa, dixique, Populus sunt errantes corde, iidemque non cognoverunt vias meas. Tentatio autem, quae etiam significatur per "quadraginta annos", describitur per haec: "Jehovah Deus tuus tecum per quadraginta annos, ut non destitutus fueris ulla re"; tum per haec, "Duxit te Jehovah quadraginta annis in deserto, ut affligeret te et tentaret te, et cibavit te manna"; tum per haec, "Duxit te in deserto ad tentandum te, et ad beneficiendum tibi postremo." Principium novae ecclesiae, post finem quadraginta annorum, describitur per introductionem eorum in terram Canaanem, quae facta est post quadraginta illos annos; et quoque intelligitur per haec, "Ad benefaciendum tibi postremo"; tum per haec, "Duxi vos in deserto quadraginta annis, ad possidendum terram. Emorraei."<p>[8] Plenaria tentatio etiam significatur per<p>Quod Moses super Monte Sinai fuerit quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes, et tunc panem non comederit et aquam non biberit (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_24_18" target=_top>Exod. 24:18</a> <sup>4</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_34_28" target=_top>34:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_9_9" target=_top>Deuteronomius 9:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_9_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_9_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_9_25" target=_top>25</a>);<p>Similiter quod Jesus fuerit in deserto tentatus a diabolo, et ibi jejunaverit quadraginta dies (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_4_1" target=_top>Matthaeus 4:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_4_2" target=_top>2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_1_13" target=_top>Marcus 1:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_4_1" target=_top>Luca 4:1</a>).<p>Ex his constare potest quod per numerum "quadraginta" in Verbo significetur plenaria vastatio, et consummatio, hoc est, quando omne bonum ecclesiae vastatum est, et malum consummatum; tum quod per eundem numerum significetur plenaria tentatio; ut et instauratio ecclesiae e novo seu reformatio: ex quibus sciri potest quid significatur per "menses quadraginta duos, quibus gentes civitatem sanctam conculcabunt": similiter in sequentibus in Apocalypsi,<p>Quod datum sit bestiae ascendenti ex mari "os loquens magna et blas phemias et data est illi potestas..menses quadraginta duos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_1" target=_top>13:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_5" target=_top>5</a> <sup>5</sup></p><p>)<p>Nemo itaque credat quod per "menses quadraginta duos" intelligantur menses, aut aliquod tempus designatum secundum numeros, hic, nec etiam in sequentibus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>3.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>4.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>5.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
