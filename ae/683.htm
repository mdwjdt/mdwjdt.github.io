<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 683</h4><p>683. Saying, The kingdoms of the world, are become our Lord's and His Christ's.- That this signifies all things in the heavens and on earth subject to the Lord, when the evil have been separated from the good, and that then the Divine Good and the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord are clearly received, is evident from the signification of the kingdoms of the world when they have become the Lord's, as denoting that the proceeding Divine from the Lord is received in love and faith, concerning which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of the Lord and His Christ, as denoting the Lord as to the Divine Good of Divine Love, and as to the Divine Truth proceeding from that love. That the Lord is called Lord from Divine Good, and Christ from Divine Truth, will be seen below.</p><p>[2] That the kingdom of the Lord means the reception of Divine Good and Divine Truth, that is, with those who receive, is evident from this fact, that the Lord reigns with the angels of heaven, and with the men of the church by means of that which proceeds from Him, which is commonly called Divine Good and Divine Truth, also justice and judgment, as well as love and faith. It is by means of these that the Lord reigns; they are therefore strictly the kingdom of the Lord with those who receive them. For when these reign with angels and men then the Lord Himself reigns, because those things which proceed from Him are Himself. The Lord in heaven is nothing else than the proceeding Divine.</p><p>[3] The Lord, indeed, not only rules those who receive celestial and spiritual Divine things from Him, but also those who do not receive, as all those who are in hell; yet it cannot be said that the kingdom of the Lord is there, since they are utterly unwilling to be governed by the proceeding Divine, and according to the laws of its order; in fact, they deny the Lord, and turn themselves away from Him; but still the Lord does rule them, not as the subjects and citizens of His kingdom, but as those who are refractory and rebellious, holding them under restraints in order that they may not do evil to one another, and especially to those who belong to His kingdom.</p><p>[4] That the Lord's kingdom is that which proceeds from Him, and is received, is evident from passages in the Word where the kingdom of God is mentioned, as in the Lord's Prayer:<p>"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, as in heaven, so also upon the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>).<p>That kingdom there means the reception of the Divine Good and Divine Truth which proceed from the Lord, and in which the Lord is with the angels of heaven and with men of the church, is evident, for it is said, "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so also upon the earth," and the will of God is done when those things are received in the heart and soul, that is, in love and faith.</p><p>[5] And elsewhere:<p>"Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and the justice thereof, then all things shall be added to you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>The kingdom of the heavens, in the spiritual sense, means the Divine Truth, and justice the Divine Good, therefore it is said, Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and the justice thereof. And, in the highest sense, the kingdom of the heavens means the Lord, since He is the all of His kingdom, and justice, in the same sense, signifies the Lord's merit; and because man, who is ruled by the Lord, desires and loves only those things that are of the Lord, he is, unknown to himself, for ever led to felicities; for this reason it is said, "all things shall be added to him," which means, that all things tending to salvation shall come to pass according to his desire.</p><p>[6] Since heaven is heaven from the reception of Divine Truth from the Lord, and similarly the church, so heaven and the church are meant in a general sense by the kingdom of God, and by the kingdom of the heavens; therefore those who receive Divine Truth, are called by the Lord "sons of the kingdom," in Matthew:<p>"The field is the world, the seed are the sons of the kingdom, the tares are the sons of the evil (mali)" (<a href="../ae/166.htm">166</a>).</p><p>[7] Moreover, that the kingdom of God signifies the church as to truths from good, and also heaven, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/48.htm">48</a>); and that the kingdom of God with man signifies to be in truths from good from the Lord, consequently to be in wisdom, and thence in the power of resisting falsities and evils, and thus that to reign is of the Lord alone, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 683</h4><p>683. Saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's, signifies all things in the heavens and on earth subject to the Lord, when the evil have been separated from the good, and that then the Divine good and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord are clearly received. This is evident from the signification of "the kingdoms of the world when they have become the Lord's," as being that the Divine proceeding from the Lord is received in love and faith (of which presently); also from the signification of "the Lord and His Christ," as being the Lord in relation to the Divine good of the Divine love, and in relation to the Divine truth proceeding from that love. That the Lord is called "Lord" from Divine good, and "Christ" from Divine truth, will be seen below.</p><p>[2] That "the kingdom of the Lord" means the reception of Divine good and Divine truth, thus with those who receive, can be seen from this, that with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church the Lord reigns through that which proceeds from Him, which is commonly called Divine good and Divine truth, likewise justice and judgment, also love and faith. It is through these that the Lord reigns, consequently these are strictly the Lord's kingdom with those who receive them; for when these reign with angels and men then the Lord Himself reigns, for the things that proceed from Him are Himself. The Lord in heaven is no other than the Divine proceeding.</p><p>[3] The Lord indeed not only rules those that receive Divine celestial and spiritual things from Him, but also those that do not receive, as all who are in hell; still it cannot be said that the Lord's kingdom is in hell, since those there are altogether unwilling to be ruled by the Divine that proceeds and according to the laws of its order; they even deny the Lord and turn themselves away from Him; yet the Lord does rule them, not like subjects and citizens of His kingdom, but like those who are refractory and rebellious, holding them in bonds that they may not do evil to one another, and especially to those who belong to His kingdom.</p><p>[4] That the Lord's kingdom is that which proceeds from Him and is received can be seen from passages in the Word where "the kingdom of God" is mentioned, as in the Lord's Prayer:<p>Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done, as in heaven so also upon the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>).<p>"Kingdom" evidently means here the reception of Divine good and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and in which the Lord is with the angels of heaven and the men of the church, for it is added, "Thy will be done, as in heaven so also upon the earth," and the will of God is done when these are received in heart and soul, that is, in love and faith.</p><p>[5] And elsewhere:<p>Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens <sup>1</sup>and His righteousness and all things shall be added to you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>"The kingdom of the heavens" means in the spiritual sense Divine truth, and "righteousness" Divine good, therefore it is said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and His righteousness." But in the highest sense "the kingdom of the heavens" means the Lord, since He is the all of His kingdom, and in the same sense "righteousness" signifies the Lord's merit. And as a man who is ruled by the Lord desires and loves only such things as are of the Lord, he is, unknown to himself, forever led to felicities; and this is why it is said that "all things shall be added to him," meaning that all things that tend to his salvation shall come to pass according to his desire.</p><p>[6] Since heaven is heaven from the reception of Divine truth from the Lord, likewise the church, so in a general sense heaven and the church are meant by "the kingdom of God" and "the kingdom of the heavens;" therefore those who receive Divine truth are called by the Lord "sons of the kingdom," in Matthew:<p>The field is the world, the seed are the sons of the kingdom, the tares are the sons of the evil one (<a href="../ae/166.htm">166</a>).</p><p>[7] Moreover, "the kingdom of God" signifies the church in respect to truths from good, and also heaven (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/48.htm">48</a>; and "the kingdom of God" with man signifies to be in truths from good from the Lord, thus in wisdom, and consequently in the power to resist falsities and evils, therefore "to reign" belongs to the Lord alone (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Greek has "God," as found also in AC (first sentence = motto); 5449; <a href="../hh/64.htm">Heaven and Hell 64</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 683 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>683. "Dicentes, Facta sunt regna mundi Domini nostri et Christi Ipsius." - Quod significet omnia in caelis et in terris subjecta Domino, quando separati sunt mali a bonis, et quod tunc Divinum Bonum ac Divinum Verum procedens a Domino clare recipiatur, constat ex significatione "regnorum mundi", cum facta sunt Domini, quod sit quod recipiatur Divinum procedens a Domino amore et fide (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "Domini et Christi Ipsius", quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, et quoad Divinum Verum ex illo Amore procedens; quod Dominus dicatur "Dominus" ex Divino Bono, ac "Christus" ex Divino Vero, videbitur infra.<p>[2] Quod "regnum Domini" sit receptio Divini Boni ac Divini Veri, ita apud illos qui recipiunt, constare potest ex eo, quod Dominus apud angelos caeli et apud homines ecclesiae regnet per id quod procedit ab Ipso, quod communiter vocatur Divinum Bonum ac Divinum Verum, tum justitia et judicium, et quoque amor et fides: haec sunt per quae Dominus regnat; proinde illa sunt proprie regnum Domini apud illos qui recipiunt; nam cum illa regnant apud angelos et homines tunc Ipse Dominus regnat, quae enim procedunt ab Ipso sunt Ipse; Dominus in caelo non aliud est quam Divinum procedens.<p>[3] Dominus quidem non modo regit illos qui recipiunt Divina caelestia et spiritualia ab Ipso, sed etiam illos qui non recipiunt, sicut omnes in inferno; sed usque non dici potest quod ibi sit regnum Domini, quoniam prorsus nolunt regi ex Divino quod procedit, et secundum ejus ordinis leges; immo negant Dominum, et se avertunt ab Ipso; at usque Dominus regit illos, non sicut regni sui subditos et cives, sed sicut refractarios et rebelles, tenendo in vinculis ne malum faciant sibi mutuo, ac imprimis illis qui e regno Ipsius sunt.<p>[4] Quod illud sit regnum Domini quod procedit ab Ipso et recipitur, constare potest a locis in Verbo ubi "regnum Dei" dicitur: ut in Oratione Domini,<p>"Adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo etiam in terra" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_683/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_6_10" target=_top>Matthaeus 6:10</a>):<p>quod ibi per "regnum" intelligatur receptio Divini Boni ac Divini Veri, quae procedunt a Domino, et in quibus est Dominus apud angelos caeli et apud homines ecclesiae, patet; nam sequitur, "Fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo etiam in terra"; voluntas Dei fit cum illa recipiuntur corde et anima, hoc est, amore et fide.<p>[5] Et alibi,<p>"Quaerite primo regnum <sup>1</sup></p><p>caelorum et ejus justitiam, tunc..omnia adjicientur vobis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_683/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_6_33" target=_top>Matthaeus 6:33</a>):<p>per "regnum caelorum" in spirituali sensu intelligitur Divinum Verum, et per "justitiam" Divinum Bonum; quare dicitur, "Quaerite primo regnum caelorum et ejus justitiam"; et in supremo sensu per "regnum caelorum" intelligitur Dominus, quoniam Ipse est omne sui regni, et per "justitiam" in eodem sensu significatur meritum Domini: et quia homo, qui regitur a Domino, non vult et amat nisi quae Domini sunt, ducitur ipso nesciente ad felicia in aeternum; ideo dicitur quod "omnia adjicientur illi", per quod intelligitur quod omnia ad salutem illius optato evenient.<p>[6] Quoniam caelum est caelum ex receptione Divini Veri a Domino, similiter ecclesia, ideo caelum et ecclesia in communi sensu intelligitur per "regnum Dei" et per "regnum caelorum": quare illi qui recipiunt Divinum Verum vocantur a Domino "filii regni", apud Matthaeum,<p>"Ager est mundus, semen. .sunt filii regni, zizania sunt filii mali" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_683/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_38" target=_top>13:38</a>):<p>quod recipientes Divini Veri intelligantur per "filios regni patet, nam dicitur "Semen sunt filii regni, et zizania sunt filii mali"; per "semen" intelligitur Divinum Verum, et per "zizania" falsum infernale; et vocantur "filii", quia "filii" in Verbi sensu spirituali significant vera, ac in opposito sensu falsa, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_683/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_166" target=_top>166</a>).<p>[7] Praeterea quod "regnum Dei" significet ecclesiam quoad vera ex bono, et quoque caelum, videatur etiam supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_683/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_48" target=_top>48</a>): et quod "regnum Dei apud hominem" significet in veris ex bono esse a Domino, ita in sapientia, et inde in potentia resistendi falsis et malis, et sic quod "regnare" sit solius Domini, etiam supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_683/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_333" target=_top>333</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
