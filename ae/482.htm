<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 482</h4><p>482. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them.- This signifies that the Lord shall teach them from heaven, as is evident from the signification of the Lamb, as denoting the Lord as to Divine Truth; see above (n. <a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>, <a href="../ae/343.htm">343</a>, <a href="../ae/464.htm">464</a>); and from the signification of the throne, as denoting heaven; see above (n. <a href="../ae/253.htm">253</a>). In the midst of the throne, signifies in the whole heaven, for in the midst signifies in all collectively and individually, or in the whole; see above (n. <a href="../ae/213.htm">213</a>); and from the signification of feeding, which denotes to teach, concerning which we shall treat presently. From these things it is evident that by the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne feeding them, is signified that the Lord will instruct them out of heaven. It is here said, "the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them," and above, that "he who sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them," from which it clearly appears that both by him who sitteth on the throne, and by the Lamb in the midst of the throne, is meant the Lord, but by Him who sitteth on the throne is meant the Lord as to Divine Good, and by the Lamb in the midst of the throne is meant the Lord as to Divine Truth. For to dwell, which is said of Him who sitteth upon the throne, is stated of good; see above (n. <a href="../ae/470.htm">470</a>); and to feed, which is said of the Lamb, is said of truth, for to feed signifies to instruct in truths.</p><p>[2] In the Word of the Old Testament the terms Jehovah and God, and also Jehovah and the Holy One of Israel, are frequently used, and both mean the Lord alone. "Jehovah" means the Lord as to Divine Good, and "God" and the "Holy One of Israel" mean the Lord as to Divine Truth; both are named on account of the marriage of Divine Good and Divine Truth in every detail of the Word. That to feed signifies to teach is evident without further explanation, since it is a custom derived from the Word to call those who teach, pastors, and those who are taught, the flock; but the reason of this is not yet known, and therefore it shall be explained. In heaven, all things which appear before the eyes are representative, for they represent under a natural appearance the spiritual things which the angels think and with which they are affected. Their thoughts and affections are thus presented before their eyes in forms like those which are in the world, or in forms similar to those of natural things, and this by virtue of the correspondence which the Lord has caused to exist between spiritual and natural things. The subject of correspondence is dealt with in many places, and in the work concerning <a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-102</a>, and 103-115). As a result of this correspondence, flocks of sheep, lambs, and goats, feeding in green pastures, and also in gardens, appear in heaven; and these appearances have their existence from the thoughts of those who are in the goods and truths of the church, and who thus think intelligently and wisely. For this reason mention is so frequently made in the Word of flock, also of pastures, and feeding, and of a shepherd. For the Word in the letter consists of such things as in heaven appear before the eyes, and which signify correspondent spiritual thing.</p><p>[3] Since it is known in the church that to feed signifies to teach, that pasture signifies instruction, and a shepherd an instructor, we will simply quote a few passages from the Word where these expressions are used, without further explanation.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"In that day shall thy cattle feed in a large pasture" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_23.htm">30:23</a>).<p>Again:<p>"He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs into his arm, and shall gently lead those that give suck" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_11.htm">40:11</a>).<p>Again:<p>"He will say to the bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed upon the ways, and their pastures shall be on all heights (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_9.htm">49:9</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Against the shepherds that feed my people, ye have scattered my flock; because of the curse the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_2.htm">23:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_10.htm">10</a>).<p>Again:<p>Israel "shall feed on Carmel and Bashan" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_19.htm">50:19</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"I will seek my flock, and search them out. I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be; there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_11.htm">34:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_14.htm">14</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>"I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of drought, when there was for them pasture" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_5.htm">13:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_6.htm">6</a>).<p>In Joel:<p>"The herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_18.htm">1:18</a>).<p>And in Micah:<p>Out of Bethlehem Ephratah shall he go forth, "who shall stand and feed in the strength of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_5_2.htm">5:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_5_4.htm">4</a>).<p>Again,<p>"Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_7_14.htm">7:14</a>).<p>In Zephaniah:<p>"The remnant of Israel shall feed and lie down" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_3_13.htm">3:13</a>).<p>In David:<p>"Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want. He will cause me to lie down in pastures of grass" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_23_1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_23_2.htm">2</a>).<p>Again:<p>"The Lord chose David; from following the ewes giving suck he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_70.htm">78:70-72</a>).<p>Again,<p>Jehovah "hath made us his people, and the flock of his pasture, therefore we are his people and the flock of his pasture" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_100_3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>).<p>In John:<p>Jesus said to Peter, "Lovest thou me?" He said that he loved Him. He said unto him, "Feed my lambs." He said to him the second time, also the third time, "Feed my sheep" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_21_15.htm">21:15-17</a>). And in very many other passages, in all of which, to feed denotes to instruct in truths, and pasture the truths in which they are instructed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 482</h4><p>482. Verse 17. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, signifies that the Lord will instruct them out of heaven. This is evident from the signification of "the Lamb," as being the Lord in relation to Divine truth (of which see above, n. <a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>, <a href="../ae/343.htm">343</a>, <a href="../ae/464.htm">464</a>); also from the signification of "throne," as being heaven (of which also above, n. <a href="../ae/253.htm">253</a>; "in the midst of the throne" signifies in the universal heaven, for "in the midst" signifies in each and every thing, that is, in the whole, see above, n. <a href="../ae/213.htm">213</a>; also from the signification of "to feed" as being to instruct (of which presently). This makes evident that "the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them" signifies that the Lord will instruct them out of heaven. It is here said, "the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them," and above, "He who sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them" which makes it very clear that it is the Lord who is meant both by "He who sitteth on the throne," and by "the Lamb in the midst of the throne," but "He who sitteth on the throne" means the Lord in relation to Divine good, and "the Lamb in the midst of the throne" means the Lord in relation to Divine truth; for "to dwell," which is said of Him that sitteth upon the throne, is predicated of good (See above, n. <a href="../ae/470.htm">470</a>); and "to feed," which is said of the Lamb, is predicated of truths; for "to feed" signifies to instruct in truths.</p><p>[2] In the Word of the Old Testament mention is frequently made of "Jehovah" and "God," also of "Jehovah" and "the Holy One of Israel," and both mean the Lord alone, "Jehovah" the Lord in relation to Divine good, and "God" and "the Holy One of Israel" the Lord in relation to Divine truth; it is thus said because of the marriage of Divine good and Divine truth in every particular of the Word. That "to feed" signifies to instruct can be seen without further explanation, since it is a custom derived from the Word to call those who teach "pastors" (or feeders), and those who are instructed "a flock;" but why they are so called is not yet known, and shall therefore be told. In heaven where all things that appear before the eyes are representative, representing under a natural appearance the spiritual things that angels think and by which they are affected; thus are their thoughts and affections presented before their eyes in such forms as exist in the world, that is, in forms similar to natural things, and this by virtue of the correspondence that is established by the Lord between spiritual things and natural. (This correspondence has been treated of in many places; also in the work Heaven and Hell, n. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>, and 103-115.) It is from this correspondence that in heaven flocks of sheep, lambs, and goats appear feeding in green pastures, and also in gardens; and these appearances spring from the thoughts of those who are in the goods and truths of the church, and who from these think intelligently and wisely. It is from this that mention is so often made in the Word of "flock," "pasture," as also of "feeding," and "feeder" (or shepherd); for the Word in the letter consists of such things as appear in heaven before the eyes, and these signify correspondent spiritual things.</p><p>[3] As it is known in the church that "to feed" signifies to instruct, "pasture" instruction, and "shepherd" an instructor, a few passages only in which "feeding" and "pasture" are mentioned shall be quoted without further explanation. In Isaiah:<p>In that day shall thy cattle feed in a broad meadow (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_23.htm">Isaiah 30:23</a>).<p>He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs into His arm, and shall gently lead them that give suck (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).<p>He shall say to the bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Reveal yourselves. They shall feed upon the ways, and in all the bare hills shall be their pasture (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_9.htm">Isaiah 49:9</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Against the shepherds that feed My people, ye have scattered My flock. Because of cursing the land mourneth; the pastures of the desert are dried up (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_10.htm">10</a>).<p>He shall feed Israel on Carmel and Bashan (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>I will seek My flock and I will search them out. I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the land. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their sheepcote be; there shall they lie down in a good sheepcote, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_14.htm">14</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>I did know thee <sup>1</sup>in the wilderness, in a land of drought; where they had pasture (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_5.htm">Hosea 13:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_6.htm">6</a>).<p>In Joel:<p>The droves of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; and the droves of sheep are made desolate (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>).<p>In Micah:<p>Out of Bethlehem of Ephrathah shall go forth one who shall stand and feed in the strength of Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_5_2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_5_4.htm">4</a>).<p>Feed Thy people with Thy rod, the flock of Thine heritage; they shall feed in Bashan and Gilead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_7_14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>).<p>In Zephaniah:<p>The remnants of Israel shall feed and lie down (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_3_13.htm">Zephaniah 3:13</a>).<p>In David:<p>Jehovah is my Shepherd, I shall not want; He will make me to lie down in pastures of herbage (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_23_1.htm">Psalms 23:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_23_2.htm">2</a>).<p>The Lord chose David; from following the ewes giving suck He brought him to feed Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance; and he fed them in the integrity of his heart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_70.htm">Psalms 78:70-72</a>).<p>Jehovah hath made us His people, and the flock of His pasture [keri].

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 482 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>482. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_7_17" target=_top>17</a>.] "Quoniam Agnus, qui in medio throni, pascet eos." - Quod significet quod Dominus e caelo instruet illos, constat ex significatione "Agni", quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297" target=_top>297</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_343" target=_top>343</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_464" target=_top>464</a> <sup>1</sup></p><p>); ex significatione "throni", quod sit caelum (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_253" target=_top>253</a> [a]); "in medio throni" significat in universo caelo, nam "in medio" significat in omnibus et singulis seu in toto (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_213" target=_top>213</a>); et ex significatione "pascere", quod sit instruere (de qua sequitur): ex his constat quod per quod "Agnus, qui in medio throni, pascet eos", significetur quod Dominus e caelo instruet illos. Hic dicitur quod "Agnus, qui in medio throni, pascet eos", et supra quod "Sedens super throno habitabit super illis"; ex quibus manifeSte patet quod per utrumque "Sedentem super throno" et per "Agnum in medio throni" intelligatur Dominus; sed quod per "Sedentem super throno intelligatur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Agnum in medio throni" Dominus quoad Divinum Verum; nam "habitare", quod dicitur de Sedente super throno, praedicatur de bono (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_470" target=_top>470</a>); et "pascere", quod dicitur de Agno, praedicatur de veris, "pascere" enim significat instruere in veris.<p>[2] In Verbo Veteris Testamenti pluries dicitur "Jehovah" et "Deus", tum "Jehovah" et "Sanctus Israelis", ac per utrumque intelligitur solus Dominus; per "Jehovam" Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Deum", tum per "Sanctum Israelis", Dominus quoad Divinum Verum; ita dicitur propter conjugium Divini Boni ac Divini Veri in singulis Verbi. <p>Quod "pascere" significet instruere, constare potest absque ulteriore expositione, quoniam in usu receptum est ex Verbo dicere "Pastor" de illis qui docent, et "Grex" de illis qui discunt; sed quod ita dicantur, [causa] nondum est <sup>2</sup></p><p>nota, quare dicetur. In caelo ubi omnia repraesentativa sunt quae coram oculis apparent, repraesentant enim sub apparentia naturali spiritualia quae angeli cogitant et quibus afficiuntur, ita sistuntur cogitationes et affectiones illorum coram oculis illorum in formis quales sunt in mundo, seu in formis naturalium similibus, et hoc ex correspondentia quae a Domino facta est inter spiritualia et naturalia (de qua correspondentia multis in locis actum est; et in opere De Caelo et Inferno n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_87" target=_top>87-102</a>, et n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_482/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_103" target=_top>103-115</a>).
