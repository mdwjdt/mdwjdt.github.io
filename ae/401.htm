<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 401</h4><p>401. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood. That this signifies that all good of love was separated, and thence that all truth of faith was falsified, is plain from the signification of the sun, as denoting, in the highest sense, the Lord as to Divine love, and thence with man the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, of which we shall speak presently; from the signification of black as sackcloth of hair, as denoting separated; black being said of darkness, thus of what does not appear from any light. It is said, "as sackcloth of hair," because the Sensual of man is meant, which is the lowest part of the natural, and, consequently, around the interiors, in which it induces darkness. There are two minds in man, (a spiritual and a natural; the spiritual mind thinks and perceives from the light [luce] of heaven, but the natural mind thinks and perceives from the light [luce] of the world; from the latter, man has a light [lumen], which is called natural light [lumen]. It is the latter mind that is called the natural man, but the former is called the spiritual man. Because the natural mind is below or outside the spiritual mind, it is, consequently, also around it, for it encloses it on every side, therefore, it is called sackcloth of hair; for when the spiritual mind, which is the higher and more interior mind, is shut, then the natural mind, which is lower and more exterior, is in darkness as to all things of heaven and the church, for all the light possessed by the natural mind, and constituting the intelligence thereof, is from the light of his spiritual mind, which light is the light of heaven. The Sensual, which is the ultimate of the Natural, appears also as hairy in the light of heaven; hence it is that hair signifies the ultimate of the natural man, which is his Sensual (see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5247.htm">5247</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5569.htm">5569-5573</a>).</p><p>[2] These things are mentioned in order that it may be known why it is said that the sun became black as sackcloth of hair; from the signification of the moon, as denoting spiritual truth, which is called the truth of faith, concerning which we shall treat presently; and from the signification of its becoming as blood, as denoting that truth was falsified; for blood, in the genuine sense, signifies Divine truth, and, in the opposite, violence offered to it, thus Divine truth falsified (that blood in the Word signifies these things, see above, n. <a href="../ae/329.htm">329</a>); hence it is evident what the moon becoming as blood signifies. The reason why the sun signifies the Lord as to Divine love, and thence with man the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and that the moon signifies spiritual truth, is, that the Lord in the heaven where the celestial angels are, appears as a Sun, and in the heaven where the spiritual angels are, as a moon. His appearance as a Sun is from His Divine love; for the Divine love appears as fire, whence the angels in the heavens have their heat; consequently, by celestial and spiritual fire, in the Word, is meant love. The Lord's appearance as a moon is from the light of that sun, for the moon derives her light (lumen) from that sun, and the light (lux) in heaven is Divine truth, consequently, by light in the Word is signified Divine truth. But concerning the sun and moon in the heavens, and concerning the heat and light thence, see what is shown in the work, <a href="../hh/116.htm">Heaven and Hell 116-125</a>, <a href="../hh/126.htm">126-140</a>.</p><p>[3] That by sun in the Word is signified the Lord as to Divine love, and with man the good of love to the Lord, and by moon the Lord as to Divine truth spiritual, is plain from the following passages. In Matthew:<p>When Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, "his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment became as the light" (<a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>).</p><p>[4] Similarly, when the Lord was seen by John as an angel, it is written,<p>"And I saw a strong angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow was around his head, and his face was as the sun" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1925.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1925</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2821.htm">2821</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3039.htm">3039</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4085.htm">4085</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8192.htm">8192</a>; that on this account angels in the Word are called gods, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7268.htm">7268</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7873.htm">7873</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8301.htm">8301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8192.htm">8192</a>.</p><p>[5] Hence when the church was represented as a woman, the sun then appeared round about her; concerning which it is thus written in the Apocalypse:<p>"A great wonder was seen in heaven; a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/252.htm">Arcana Coelestia 252</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/253.htm">253</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/749.htm">749</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/770.htm">770</a>.) And because the church is from the Lord, therefore, she was seen encompassed with the sun. What is signified by the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars, will also be shown in that explanation.</p><p>[6] Hence it is said by David:<p>"The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds, by clear shining after rain" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8581.htm">8581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10580.htm">10580</a>; and that light denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a Sun, thus from His Divine love, in the work concerning <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>.)</p><p>[7] Similarly it is said, in the book of Judges, respecting those who love Jehovah:<p>"Let them that love him be as the sun arising in his might" (<a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>.</p><p>[8] In David:<p>"His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in the clouds" (<a href="../ae/205.htm">205</a>). By his seed which shall endure for ever, is signified the Divine truth, and those also are signified, who receive it. By his throne which [shall endure] as the sun before Me, are signified His heaven and church, which are in celestial good, which is the good of love. By the throne which shall be established for ever as the moon, is signified heaven and the church, which are in spiritual good, which is Divine truth. By a faithful witness in the clouds, is signified the Word in the sense of the letter, which is called a witness because it testifies, the clouds denoting the sense of the letter of the Word.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>"They shall fear thee with the sun, and before the moon, a generation of generations. In his day shall the just flourish; and much peace until the moon is not. His name shall endure for ever, before the sun shall the name of the Son be held: and all nations shall be blest in him" (<a href="../njhd/21.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 21</a>). This, therefore, is what is signified by "until the moon is not," namely, with those who are meant by the just, in whom there is much peace. But, in the highest sense, by those words are meant the Lord as to His Divine Human, that this shall become the Divine good of the Divine love, therefore it is also added, "before the sun shall the name of the Son be held." By the Son is meant the Lord's Divine Human; and because by the nations are meant all those who are in good, or who receive the good of love from the Lord, it is therefore said, "and all nations shall be blessed in Him." That by nations are signified those who are in good, and by peoples those who are in truths, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>.</p><p>[10] In Isaiah:<p>"There shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill, brooks and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers shall fall. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days" (<a href="../lj/56.htm">Last Judgment 56</a>, <a href="../lj/58.htm">58</a>). That it shall then be granted to those who are in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbour, to understand truths, is signified by, "There shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill, brooks and streams of waters." Those who are upon a high mountain, are those who are in the good of love to the Lord, a high mountain signifying that good; those who are upon a lofty hill, are those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbour, a hill signifying that good, brooks and streams of waters signifying intelligence from truths. That then there shall be truth in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as there was formerly truth in the celestial kingdom, and that then the truth in the celestial kingdom shall become the good of love, is meant by, "The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days"; for by light is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; by the light of the moon, the Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom, and by the light of the sun, the Divine truth in the celestial kingdom; by sevenfold is signified full and perfect, and truth is then full and perfect when it becomes good, or is good in form. It is evident that the sun and moon in the earths are not meant, but the sun and moon in the heavens. It should be known, that when the Last Judgment takes place, the Lord appears in the heavens in much greater effulgence and splendour than at other times, and this because the angels there must then be more powerfully defended; for lower things, with which the exteriors of the angels have communication, are in a state of disturbance. This is why, when the Last Judgment is here treated of, it is said, "The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days"; and therefore it is also said that there shall then be brooks and streams of waters upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill, by which [is signified] abundance of intelligence with those who are upon the higher mountains and higher hills, for the lower mountains and hills are those upon which judgment takes place. (That the Lord appears to those who are in His celestial kingdom as a Sun, and to those who are in His spiritual kingdom as a moon, may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/116.htm">Heaven and Hell 116-127</a>; and that the light from them is the Divine truth, n. <a href="../hh/127.htm">127-140</a>.)</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>"Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw itself: for Jehovah shall be for a light of eternity unto thee, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">60:20</a>).<p>The Lord is here treated of, and the new heaven and the new earth, that is, the church to be established by Him. That the good of love to the Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbour should not perish with those who are in that church, is meant by, "Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw itself"; for, to those who are in the good of love to Him, the Lord appears as a Sun, and to those who are in truths from the good of charity towards the neighbour, as a moon; hence by thy sun is signified the good of love to the Lord, and by thy moon the good of charity, which, in its essence, is truth from good. That they shall continue to eternity in truths from the good of love, and in truths from the good of charity, is meant by, "Jehovah shall be for a light of eternity unto thee, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled." A light of eternity is said of those who are in the good of love to the Lord, and the fulfilling of the days of mourning, of those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbour, or in truths from good; for mourning, with those who belonged to the ancient churches, represented grief on account of the loss or destruction of truth and good; that they shall be fulfilled, signifies that they shall be ended, and so that they shall be in truths from good. From these things it is evident what is signified by the sun becoming as sackcloth of hair, and the moon becoming as blood, namely, that the good of love to the Lord is separated, and, consequently, truth is falsified.</p><p>[12] Things almost similar are signified in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>"Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel with indignation and the wrath of anger, to lay the land waste; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shine not with their light; the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. I will visit their wickedness upon the world, and upon the impious their iniquity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">13:9-11</a>).<p>By the day of Jehovah, cruel with indignation and the wrath of anger, is signified the day of the Last Judgment; by the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof not shining with their light, the sun being darkened in his rising, and the moon not making her light to shine, is signified, that the knowledges (cognitions) of good and truth have perished, also the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity towards the neighbour, and consequently, the truth which is called the truth of faith; for by stars are signified the knowledges of good; by constellations, the knowledges of truth; by the sun, the good of love to the Lord; and by the moon, the good of charity towards the neighbour, which, in its essence, is truth from good, and is called the truth of faith. The sun is said to be darkened in his rising, and the moon not to make her light to shine; not that the sun and moon in the angelic heavens are darkened, for the sun there is always in its effulgence, and the moon in its splendour; but before those who were in evils and the falsities thence, goods and truths are thus [obscured]; therefore it is thus said according to the appearance, for those who are in evils and the falsities thence, turn themselves away from the good of love and charity, consequently, from the Lord, and then they will nothing but evil, and think nothing but falsity, and those who will and think nothing else, see nothing but thick darkness and darkness (caliginem et tenebras) in the things that pertain to heaven and the church. Because such persons are meant, with whom the sun is darkened and the moon does not make her light to shine, therefore it is said, "to lay the land waste, and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it," and afterwards, "I will visit their wickedness upon the world, and their iniquity upon the impious." By the land and the world is signified the church; by laying it waste, is signified that there is no longer any good; and by visiting upon the world their wickedness, and upon the impious their iniquity, is signified the Last Judgment.</p><p>[13] In Ezekiel:<p>"When I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. All the luminaries of light in the heavens will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">32:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_32_8.htm">8</a>).<p>These things are said concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt, by whom the natural man separate from the spiritual is there signified. This, when separated, is entirely in thick darkness and in darkness as to all things of heaven and the church, and as far as it is separated it denies them; for the natural man sees nothing in such things from itself, but through the spiritual man from the Lord, for the natural man is in the heat and light of the world, whereas the spiritual is only in the heat and light of heaven. From these things it is evident what is meant by the details here, namely, that by, "When I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens," are signified the interiors, which are in the light of heaven; by, "I will make the stars thereof dark," are signified the knowledges of good and truth; by, "I will cover the sun with a cloud," is signified the good of love to the Lord; by, "the moon shall not cause her light to shine," is signified the good of charity towards the neighbour and the truth of faith thence; by, "All the luminaries of light will I make dark over thee," are signified all truths; and by, "I will set darkness upon thy land," are signified falsities.</p><p>[14] In Joel:<p>The day of Jehovah cometh. A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity. Before him the earth is moved; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_10.htm">10</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_31.htm">2:31</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"The day of Jehovah is near in the valley cut off. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_14.htm">3:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_15.htm">15</a>).<p>In the Evangelists:<p>"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_25.htm">25</a>).<p>In the Apocalypse:<p>"The fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; and the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_12.htm">8:12</a>).<p>And elsewhere:<p>"There arose a smoke out of the pit of the abyss, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_2.htm">9:2</a>).<p>That in these passages, by the sun and the moon being darkened (tenebratos) is meant that there were no longer any good and truth, is plain from what has been said above; therefore they are no further explained.</p><p>[15] Because such things are signified by the sun being darkened, therefore the sun was darkened when the Lord was upon the cross, because He was entirely rejected by the church, which was then among the Jews, and they were, consequently, in dense darkness or in falsities. Concerning this [it is] thus [written] in Luke:<p>"At the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour, for the sun was darkened" (<a href="../ae/64.htm">64</a>, <a href="../ae/83.htm">83</a>, <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a> at the end.)</p><p>[16] In Micah:<p>"Jehovah said against the prophets that seduce the people, Night shall be unto you, instead of a vision; and darkness shall rise upon you, instead of divination; and the sun shall set over the prophets, and the day shall grow black over them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_3_5.htm">3:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_3_6.htm">6</a>).<p>What these words signify in the spiritual sense, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_9.htm">8:9</a>).<p>By these words is signified that in the church, where the Word is, from which good and truth can be known, there is nevertheless nothing but evil and falsity. To cause the sun to set, and to darken the earth, signify evil of the life, and falsity of doctrine in the church; for by the rising of the sun is signified the good of love, which is the good of life, and by the setting of the sun is signified evil of the love, which is evil of the life; and by the darkening of the earth is signified the falsity of doctrine thence, darkness signifying falsities, and the earth the church. By, at mid-day, and, in the day of light, is signified, when knowledges of good and truth may be there, because they have the Word; mid-day signifying, where there are knowledges of good, and the day of light, where there are knowledges of truth. That they are from the Word is, because the latter are said of the church where the Word is.</p><p>[17] In Habakkuk:<p>"The mountains were moved; the overflowing of the waters passed by. The sun and moon stood in [their] place; for light thine arrows go forth, for splendour the lightning of thy spear" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_10.htm">3:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_11.htm">11</a>).<p>In this chapter the Lord's advent and the Last Judgment then [accomplished] by Him, are treated of. By the mountains being moved, and the overflowing of the waters passing by, is signified that those are rejected who are in the love of self and of the world, through the falsities of evil into which they are let. Mountains signify the loves of self and of the world; and the overflowing of the waters signifies immersion in the falsities thence; waters denoting falsities, and overflowing denoting immersion. That genuine truths and goods do not then appear to them, but instead thereof imaginary truths and goods, which in themselves are falsities and evils, is signified by, "for light thine arrows go forth, for splendour the lightning of [thy] spear"; arrows or lightnings (fulgura) signifying imaginary truths, which in themselves are falsities, and the lightning (fulmen) of the spear signifying imaginary goods, which in themselves are evils of falsity. For such signs appear in the spiritual world, with those who are in falsities from the loves of self and the world, when the Last Judgment takes place, and such are rejected.</p><p>[18] Because in this prophet it is said, "The sun and moon stood still in their place," it shall also be explained what is signified by the sun resting in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon; concerning which it is thus written in Joshua:<p>"Then spake Joshua to Jehovah, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, rest thou in Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun rested, and the moon stayed, until the nation was avenged upon its enemies. Is not this written in the book of the Upright (Recti)? And the sun stood in the midst of the heaven, neither hasted to go down about a whole day" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_12.htm">10:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_13.htm">13</a>).<p>That it is said that the sun stood in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, signified that the church was entirely vastated as to all good and truth; for [a battle] was then fought against the king of Jerusalem and the kings of the Amorites; and by the king of Jerusalem is signified the truth of the church entirely vastated by falsities, and by the kings of the Amorites is signified the good of the church vastated by evils; therefore those kings were smitten with hailstones, by which were signified the dire falsities of evil. It is said that the sun rested and the moon stayed in [their] place, namely, before the sons of Israel, that they might see their enemies; but this is prophetical, although it is historically related, as is evident from the fact of its being said, "Is not this written in the book of the Upright?" which was a prophetical book from which they were taken; therefore from the same book it is also said, "Until the nation was avenged upon its enemies," and not, "Until the sons of Israel were avenged upon their enemies," nation being used prophetically. The same is also evident from this, that this miracle, if it had thus taken place, would have inverted the whole order of the world; the rest of the miracles in the Word would not do this. In order, therefore, that it might be known that this was said prophetically, it is added, "Is not this written in the book of the Upright? But nevertheless, that there was a light given to them from heaven, as the light of the sun in Gibeon, and as the light of the moon in the valley of Ajalon, is not to be doubted.</p><p>[19] In Jeremiah:<p>"She that hath borne seven shall languish; she shall breathe out her soul; her sun shall set while it is yet day; it shall be ashamed and blush; and the remains of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies" (<a href="../ae/257.htm">257</a>). By, "her sun shall set while it is yet day," is signified that the good of the church would perish, although it possessed the Word, and by it might have been in light. "It shall be ashamed and blush" - that is, the sun - signifies because good and truth are not received, but evil and falsity, as is also evident from the passage immediately following from Isaiah. "The remains of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies," signifies that all the remaining good and truth shall perish by falsity from evil, remains denoting all that is left; to be delivered to the sword denoting, to perish by falsities; [and] enemies denoting evils.</p><p>[20] In Isaiah:<p>"Jehovah will visit upon the host of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the earth upon the earth. Then the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_21.htm">24:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">23</a>).<p>To visit signifies to destroy, because visitation precedes judgment, when those who are in evils and the falsities thence are destroyed. By the host of the height in the height are signified all the evils from the love of self. By the host are signified all evils; by the kings of the earth, falsities of every kind; and by the earth, the church. It is hence evident what is signified by, "Jehovah will visit upon the host of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the earth upon the earth." The reason why it is said, upon the host of the height in the height, is, that those who are in the love of self, in the spiritual world seek high places. By, "Then the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed," is signified that there is no longer any reception of Divine truth and Divine good, the moon and the sun signifying the truth of faith and the good of love, which are said to blush and be ashamed when they are no longer received, but instead thereof falsity and evil.</p><p>[21] In David:<p>"Jehovah, who made the heavens by his intelligence, hath stretched out the earth upon the waters. He hath made great luminaries; the sun to rule by day; the moon and stars to rule by night. He hath smitten Egypt in their first-born; and hath brought out Israel from their midst" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_136_5.htm">Psalms 136:5-11</a>).<p>He who knows nothing of the spiritual sense of the Word, must hold that these words involve nothing but what appears in the sense of the letter; but yet each particular involves such things as relate to angelic wisdom, these being all things Divine, celestial, and spiritual. The new creation or regeneration of the men of the church, of whom the church [is formed] is thereby described. By the heavens which [Jehovah] hath made by His intelligence, are signified the internal things of the men of the church, which, in one expression, are called the spiritual man, where intelligence resides, and where their heaven is. By the earth which He hath stretched out upon the waters, is signified the external of the church, which, in one expression, is called the natural man. It is here said to be stretched out upon the waters, because therein are the truths by which he is regenerated, waters denoting truths. By the great luminaries, the sun, the moon, and the stars, are signified the good of love, the truth from that good, and the knowledges of good and truth - by the sun, the good of love; by the moon, the truth from that good; and by the stars, the knowledges (cognitions) of good and truth. The reason why it is said that the sun was made to rule by day, is that the day signifies the light of the spiritual man, for it has enlightenment and perception from the good of love; and the reason why it is said that the moon and the stars were made to rule by night, is that the night signifies the light of the natural man, for the light of this is to the light of the spiritual man, comparatively as the light of the night from the moon and the stars, to the light of the day from the sun. Because the regeneration of the men of the church is treated of, it also follows, "He hath smitten Egypt in their first-born; and brought out Israel from their midst," for by Egypt is signified the natural man, such as he is from birth, namely, in absolute falsities from evil; the first-born thereof denote primary things, and the destruction of these while man is being regenerated, is meant by, "He hath smitten Egypt in their first-born." By Israel is signified the spiritual man, and by bringing him out from their midst, is signified to open, and thus to regenerate it; for the man of the church is regenerated from the Lord by the dissipation of the falsities from evils, in the natural man, and by the opening of the spiritual man, which is effected from the Lord by means of spiritual light, which is Divine truth.</p><p>[22] Similar things are signified by these words in Genesis:<p>"God made two great luminaries; the great luminary to rule by day, and the lesser luminary to rule by night, and the stars" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_16.htm">1:16</a>).<p>The subject treated of in this chapter is the new creation or the regeneration of the men of whom the Most Ancient Church [was constituted], which is described in the sense of the letter, by the creation of heaven and earth. Similar things also are signified by these words in Jeremiah:<p>"Thus said the Lord Jehovih, who giveth the sun for the light of the day, and the ordinances of the moon and the stars for the light of the night" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">31:35</a>).<p>By the ordinances of the moon and the stars, are signified all things that are effected in the natural man according to the laws of order.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>"Praise ye Jehovah, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts; praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light; praise him, ye heaven of heavens" ([Ps.] <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_1.htm">148:1-4</a>).<p>By praising Jehovah is signified to worship Him. By the angels are signified those who are in Divine truths from the good of love, for such are angels. By all the hosts are signified goods and truths in their whole compass. By the sun and moon are signified the good of love and the truth from that good. By the stars of light are signified the knowledges of truth from good. By the heavens of heavens are signified goods and truths both internal and external. Because man worships the Lord from those things that he has from the Lord, thus from the goods and truths which he has, and because man also is a man from them, it is therefore said to them, namely, to the sun, moon, and stars, by which are signified goods and truths, that they shall praise, that is, worship Jehovah. Who does not know that the sun, moon, and stars do not praise, that is, worship?</p><p>[24] In Moses:<p>Of Joseph he said, blessed of Jehovah be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, for the deep that also lieth beneath, and for the precious things of the produce of the sun, and for the precious things brought forth of the months" (<a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>.)</p><p>[25] In Isaiah:<p>"I will make thy suns a ruby, and thy gates into stones of carbuncle, and all thy border into stones of desire" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_12.htm">54:12</a>).<p>These things are said of the Gentiles outside the church, from whom a new church was to be established by the Lord. By, "I will make thy suns a ruby," is signified, that goods [shall be] brilliant from the fire of love, suns there denoting the goods of love, and the ruby denoting a brilliance as from fire. By, "I will make thy gates into stones of carbuncle," is signified, that truths [shall be] resplendent from good, gates denoting the introductory truths, specifically the doctrinals that are from good. For all genuine truths of doctrine proceed from good, and are goods; and carbuncle stones signify their brightness from good, all precious stones signifying truths from good, [and] the colour, brightness, and fire thereof, indicating the quality of truth from good. By, "I will make all their border into stones of desire," is signified, that the scientific truths which pertain to the natural man, shall be pleasant and delightful from good; for by a border is meant the same as by a foundation, and this is the natural man, because in the things there the goods and truths of the spiritual man are terminated, and stones of desire denote truths pleasant and delightful from good. By these are meant the goods and truths of the Word which those have who belong to the New Church, [and] which will be of such a nature. That the sun signifies the good of love, is also evident from the fact of their being called suns in the plural number.</p><p>[26] In Job:<p>"If I rejoiced that my wealth was great, and that my hand had found much; if I beheld the light that it shone, and the moon that it walked clearly; and my heart hath secretly misled itself, and my hand hath kissed my mouth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_31_25.htm">31:25-28</a>).<p>By these words in the spiritual sense is meant that he had not acquired to himself intelligence from the proprium, and that he had taken no merit to himself, nor gloried in it; for, "If I rejoiced that my wealth was great, and that my hand had found much," signifies, had he gloried that he had intelligence, and that he had acquired it to himself from the proprium? wealth denoting the knowledges of good and truth, by which intelligence [is attained]; and "that my hand had found much," denoting what he acquired from the proprium. "If I beheld the light that it shone, and the moon that it walked clearly," signifies the spiritual truths that constitute intelligence; the sun and the moon signifying spiritual truths. "And my heart hath secretly misled itself, and my hand hath kissed my mouth," signifies, have I thence gloried inwardly? and have I claimed them to myself?</p><p>[27] In Matthew:<p>"That ye may be the sons of your Father which is in the heavens; for he maketh his sun to arise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">5:45</a>).<p>Charity towards the neighbour is here treated of, as is evident from what precedes and follows here, and specifically concerning the Jews, who accounted the Gentiles as enemies, and their own [countrymen] as friends. That they ought to love the former just as with the latter, is illustrated by the Lord by this comparison. But because all comparisons in the Word are from correspondences, and thence signify, as do other things that are not said comparatively, therefore this comparison also [corresponds]; and by, the Father in the heavens maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust, is signified that the Lord flows in from heaven with the Divine good of love and with the Divine truth, equally with those who are outside the Jewish Church, as with those who are within it, the sun also there signifying the good of love, and the rain the Divine truth. The evil and the unjust signify, in the internal sense, those who belonged to the Jewish Church, because they did not receive; and the good and the just signify those who were outside that church, and did receive. In general, all the evil and good, and the just and unjust, are those who are here meant, for the Lord flows in with good and truth equally with all, but all do not equally receive.</p><p>[28] Because the sun signifies the Lord as to Divine love, therefore He is called the Sun of justice in Malachi ( 3:20); and a Sun and Shield in David (<a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141</a>, <a href="../hh/148.htm">148-150</a>); and that by the north is meant truth in obscurity, in the same chapter (n. 148-150), for there the four quarters in the spiritual world are treated of.) By the setting of the sun is also signified the state of the church when it is in ignorance, which is its first state; and by the rising of the sun is signified its state when it is in light. By the setting of the sun is also signified the state of the church when it is in evils and the falsities thence; and by the rising of the sun, when it is in goods and the truths thence.</p><p>[29] The first state of the church, when it is still in ignorance, is signified by the commencement of the passover in the evening when the sun was set; according to these words of Moses:<p>"Thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the stated time of thy going forth out of Egypt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7093.htm">7093</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7867.htm">7867</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9286.htm">9286-9295</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10655.htm">10655</a>). And because the first state of regeneration is a state of ignorance, therefore that feast commenced in the evening, when the sun was going down. That state is also signified by the departure of the sons of Israel from Egypt; for in Egypt they were in a servile state, and thence in a state of ignorance, therefore it is said, "at the stated time of the going forth out of Egypt."</p><p>[30] The last state of the church, which is when the church is in falsities and evils, which is its last state, is signified by the going down of the sun, in Moses:<p>"When the sun was about to go down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a terror and great darkness fell upon him. At length, when the sun had set, and it was dark, behold, a furnace of smoke, and a torch of fire that passed through between those pieces" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_17.htm">17</a>).<p>These things are said of the posterity of Abram from Jacob, or of the Israelitish and Jewish nation; and by, "When the sun was about to go down," and by, "At length, when the sun was set," is signified the last state of the church in that nation, that they were in absolute falsities and evils. The great darkness and the furnace of smoke, signify falsities from evil; and the torch of fire signifies the dire love of self, from which their evils and falsities [proceeded].</p><p>[31] As most things in the Word also have an opposite sense, so also have the sun and moon, and, in that sense, the sun signifies the love of self, and the moon, the falsities thence. The reason why such things are signified by the sun and moon is, that those who are in a natural, and not in a spiritual idea, do not think beyond nature, and hence when they see that from those two luminaries, or from their light and heat, all things arise upon the earth, and, as it were, live, they suppose that they are the rulers of the universe; they do not elevate their thoughts higher. This is the case with all those who are in the love of self, and thence in evils and falsities, for such are merely natural and sensual men, and the merely natural and sensual man does not think beyond nature, for what he does not see and touch, he believes to be nothing. The ancients, with whom all things of the church consisted of representatives of spiritual things in natural, and with whom, therefore, the sun signified the Lord as to Divine good, and the moon Him as to Divine truth, and who therefore in worship turned their faces to the rising of the sun-those among, them who were in the love of self, and thence were merely natural and sensual, began to worship, as their chief gods, the sun and the moon which they saw with their eyes. And because they alone did this, or persuaded others who were in the love of self, and thence in evils and falsities, to do it, therefore, by the sun is signified the love of self, and by the moon the falsity thence. This is still more evident from those spirits in the other life who had been of such a quality in the world; these avert the face from the Lord, and turn it to certain dark objects (caliginosum et tenebricosum) there, which are in place of the sun and moon of the world, from opposition to the sun and moon of the angelic heaven (concerning which more may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/122.htm">Heaven and Hell 122</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>). By such persons was the worship of the sun and moon instituted in ancient times, when all Divine worship was representative. But at this day, representatives having ceased, the worship of the sun and moon does not exist in the Christian world, but instead thereof the worship of self, which exists with those in whom the love of ruling predominates. Hence it is now clear what is signified by the sun and moon in the opposite sense.</p><p>[32] That in ancient times they worshipped the sun and moon, is manifest from the Gentiles, who dedicated shrines to them, of which [there are records] in many histories; that the Egyptians also, as well as the Jews and Israelites, [worshipped the sun and moon] is plain from the Word. That the Egyptians [did so may be seen] in Jeremiah:<p>The king of Babylon "shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt, and shall break in pieces the statues of the house of the sun, in the land of Egypt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_43_11.htm">43:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_43_13.htm">13</a>).<p>That the Jews and Israelites also [did so, may be seen] in Ezekiel:<p>I beheld "their faces towards the east; and they bowed themselves towards the rising of the sun" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_16.htm">8:16</a>).<p>The abominations of Jerusalem are here treated of. In the second book of Kings:<p>Josiah the king "put down the idolatrous priests, who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, the moon, and to the stars, and to all the host of the heavens. He furthermore took away the horses that the kings of Judah had set up to the sun, at the entering in of the house of Jehovah, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_23_5.htm">23:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_23_11.htm">11</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"They shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, and the bones of his priests, and the bones of his prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and they shall spread them to the sun and the moon and all the host of the heavens, whom they have loved, and whom they have served" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">8:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_2.htm">2</a>).<p>And also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">44:17-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_25.htm">25</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_4_19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_3.htm">17:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">5</a>).</p><p>[33] Because by Moab in the Word are signified those who are in the life of falsity from the love of self; and as by their worship [is signified] the worship of self, therefore, when the Israelitish people approached the worship of the Moabitish people, it was commanded that the heads of the people should be hung up before the sun; concerning which circumstance it is thus written in Moses:<p>"The daughters of Moab called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed themselves down unto their gods. Especially did Israel join himself unto Baalpeor; wherefore Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the sun" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2468.htm">2468</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8315.htm">8315</a>.</p><p>[34] Hence also it is clear that the sun of the world signifies the love of self. Because the love of self lets man into his proprium, and keeps him therein, for man's proprium looks to himself continually, and is nothing but evil, and from evil every falsity exists, therefore by the heat of the sun is signified adulterated truth, which in its essence is the falsity of evil. This is signified by the heat of the sun in the following passages. In the Apocalypse<p>"The fourth angel poured out his vial into the sun; and it was given unto him to scorch men with fire" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_8.htm">16:8</a>).<p>And elsewhere:<p>"They shall hunger no more, neither shall the sun light upon them, nor any heat" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_16.htm">7:16</a>).<p>In David:<p>"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. Jehovah shall guard thee from all evil; he shall guard thy soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_121_6.htm">Psalms 121:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_121_7.htm">7</a>).<p>By the sun is here meant the love of self, and by the moon the falsity thence; because all evil is from that love, and from that [all] falsity, therefore it is said, "Jehovah shall guard thee from all evil, and he shall guard thy soul," the soul signifying the life of truth.</p><p>[35] In Matthew:<p>"Other seeds fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and when the sun was risen they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_5.htm">13:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_6.htm">6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_4_5.htm">Mark 4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_4_6.htm">6</a>).<p>By the seeds are signified truths from the Word, or those which man receives from the Lord, for it is afterwards said, that it is the Son of Man that soweth. By stony places is signified an historical faith, which is the faith of another in man, for he believes it to be true, not because he sees it in himself, but because another, in whom he trusts, has said it. By ground is signified spiritual good, because this receives truths, as ground does seeds. By the sun being risen is signified the love of self; and by the seed being scorched and withering away, are signified to adulterate and to perish. Hence it is clear what is signified by these words of the Lord in a series, namely, that the truths implanted from infancy from the Word or from preaching, when man begins to think from himself, are adulterated and perish by lusts from the love of self. All things, indeed, in the Word, are truths, but they are adulterated by the ideas of the thought concerning them, and their application, whence truths, with such, are not truths except as to the utterance of them only. The reason why this is so, is that all the life of truth is from spiritual good, and spiritual good resides in the higher or interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind. This mind cannot be opened with those who are in the love of self, for they look to themselves in everything. If they raise their eyes to heaven, still the thought of their spirit dwells on self, and, consequently, from the fire of its own glory, it excites things sensual, external, and corporeal, which have been taught from childhood to imitate such affections as pertain to the spiritual man.</p><p>[36] It is written in Jonah that the gourd, which came up over him, withered away, and that the sun smote his head so that he fell sick; these words, because they are not intelligible without the internal sense, shall be explained in a few words. Of these things, it is thus written in Jonah:<p>"Jehovah prepared a gourd, which came up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to turn away his evil, and Jonah rejoiced over the gourd. And God prepared a worm, when the morning rose the next day, which smote the gourd that it withered. It further came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a drying east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, and he was sick, whence he wished that his soul might die. Then God said to Jonah, Is it just for thee to be angry over the gourd? He said, It is just for me to be angry, even unto death. Jehovah said, Thou hast had pity upon the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured; thou hast not done what is perfect, because thou wast made a son of night, and a son of night perisheth; shall not I have pity upon Nineveh, a great city, in which are more than twelve thousand of men?" (<a href="../njhd/248.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>.)</p><p>[37] The reason that the love of self is signified here and in the preceding passages, is, that by the sun, in the genuine spiritual sense, is signified love to the Lord, and to this love the love of self is opposed. The Lord's Divine love, also, which is present with every one, is turned into the love of self with the evil. For everything that flows into a recipient subject is changed into what agrees with its own nature; as the pure heat of the sun is turned into an offensive smell in subjects of such a nature and the pure light of the sun, into hideous colours in objects of such reception; hence it is that by the sun which beat upon the head of Jonah, is signified the love of self, in himself. And also in Matthew, by the risen sun, by which the seeds upon the stony places were scorched.</p><p>[38] In the Apocalypse:<p>"The city" New Jerusalem "has no need of the sun and moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_23.htm">21:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>).<p>By the sun here, of which the city New Jerusalem will have no need, is signified natural love, which, viewed in itself, is the love of self and the world; and by the moon is signified natural light, for natural light viewed in itself is from natural love, and the quality of the light is according to the quality of the love; but spiritual love and spiritual light are signified by, the glory of God shall lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.</p><p>[39] That such is the meaning of these words, is quite clear from these words in Isaiah:<p>"The sun shall be no more a light to thee by day; and in shining the moon shall not give light to thee; but Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and thy God for thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw itself; for Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">20</a>).<p>Similar things are signified by the sun and moon in a former passage adduced above in the Apocalypse, namely, by the sun [is signified] merely natural love, and by the moon, the natural light thence. But by the sun and the moon in the last passage are meant the sun and moon of the angelic heaven, and by that sun is signified the Lord's Divine love, and by the moon the Divine truth, as explained above. For it is first said, "The sun shall be no more a light to thee by day, and in shining the moon shall not give light to thee"; and afterwards it is said, "Thy sun shall no more go down; and thy moon shall not withdraw itself." From these things it is now clear what the sun and the moon signify in both senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 401</h4><p>401. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, signifies that all the good of love was separated, and thence all the truth of faith falsified. This is evident from the signification of "sun" as being in the highest sense the Lord in respect to Divine love, and thence with man the good of love to the Lord from the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of "black as sackcloth of hair," as being separated; "black" is predicated of thick darkness, thus of what does not appear from any light. It is said "as sackcloth of hair," because it means the sensual of man, which is the lowest of the natural, and is thus round about the interiors, in which it induces thick darkness. Man has two minds, a spiritual and a natural; the spiritual mind thinks and perceives from the light of heaven, but the natural mind thinks and perceives from the light of the world; from the latter, man has a light that is called natural light [lumen]. This natural mind is what is called the natural man, but the spiritual mind is what is called the spiritual man. As the natural mind is below or outside of the spiritual mind it is also round about it, for it enwraps it on every side; therefore it is called "sackcloth of hair" or "hairy;" for when the spiritual mind, which is the higher and interior mind, is closed, then the natural mind, which is the lower and exterior, is in thick darkness in respect to all things of heaven and the church; for all the light that the natural mind has, and that constitutes its intelligence, is from the light of his spiritual mind, and this light is the light of heaven. The sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural, is also in the light of heaven like something hairy; from this it is that "hair" signifies the ultimate of the natural man, which is the sensual (See Arcana Co (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3301.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5247.htm">5247</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5569.htm">5569-5573</a>), n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5247.htm">5247</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5569.htm">5569-5573</a>). These things have been said that it may be known why it is that "the sun became black as sackcloth of hair."</p><p>[2] The above is evident also from the signification of the "moon" as being spiritual truth, which is called the truth of faith (of which presently); also from the signification of "became as blood," as being that truth was falsified; for "blood" in the genuine sense signifies Divine truth, and in the contrary sense, violence offered to Divine truth, thus Divine truth falsified (that this is the signification of "blood" in the Word, see above, n. <a href="../ae/329.htm">329</a>; this makes clear what "the moon became as blood" signifies. "The sun" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, and thus with man the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and "the moon" signifies spiritual truth, because the Lord in the heaven of celestial angels appears as a sun, and in the heaven of spiritual angels as a moon. His appearing as a sun is from His Divine love, for Divine love appears as a fire, from which angels in the heavens have their heat; consequently celestial and spiritual "fire" means in the Word, love. The Lord's appearing as a moon is from the light that is from that sun, for the moon derives her light [lumen] from that sun, and light in heaven is Divine truth, consequently "light" in the Word signifies Divine truth. (But of the Sun and the Moon in the Heavens, and the Heat and Light Therefrom, see what is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell (<a href="../hh/116.htm">116-125</a>, <a href="../hh/126.htm">126-140</a>)</p><p>[3] That in the Word "sun" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, and with man the good of love to the Lord, and the "moon" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth spiritual, is evident from the following passages. In Matthew:<p>When Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became as light (<a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>).</p><p>[4] Likewise when the Lord was seen by John as an angel, respecting which we read:<p>And I saw a strong angel coming down out of heaven, encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow about his head, and his face was as the sun (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1925.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1925</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2821.htm">2821</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3039.htm">3039</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4085.htm">4085</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8192.htm">8192</a>; that this is why in the Word angels are called gods, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7268.htm">7268</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7873.htm">7873</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8301.htm">8301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8192.htm">8192</a>.)</p><p>[5] So, too, when the church was represented as a woman, the sun also then appeared around her; which is thus described in Revelation:<p>A great sign was seen in heaven; a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/252.htm">Arcana Coelestia 252</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/253.htm">253</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/749.htm">749</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/770.htm">770</a>.) And because the church is from the Lord she was seen encompassed with the sun. What is signified by "the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars," will also be shown in that explanation.</p><p>[6] It is therefore said by David:<p>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds, from the brightness after rain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8581.htm">8581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10580.htm">10580</a>; and that "light" is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun, thus out of His Divine love, see in the work on <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>.)</p><p>[7] In like manner it is said of those who love Jehovah, in the book of Judges:<p>Let them that love Him be as the going forth of the sun in his might (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1736.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1736</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5041.htm">5041</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8864.htm">8864</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9315.htm">9315</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9373.htm">9373</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10146.htm">10146</a>). Of those who love Him it is said, "as the going forth of the sun in his might," which signifies the Lord's Divine love in them. Of such it is also said that "they shall shine as the sun," in Matthew:<p>The righteous shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of My <sup>1</sup>Father (<a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>)</p><p>[8] In David:<p>His seed shall be to eternity, and His throne as the sun before Me. It shall be established as the moon to eternity, and as a faithful witness in the clouds (<a href="../ae/205.htm">205</a>); "his seed which shall be to eternity" signifies Divine truth, and also those who receive it; "his throne as the sun before Me" signifies the heaven and church of the Lord, which are in celestial good, which is the good of love; "the throne established as the moon to eternity" signifies the heaven and the church that are in spiritual good, which is Divine truth; "a faithful witness in the clouds" signifies the Word in the sense of the letter, which is called "a witness" because it witnesses, "clouds" meaning the sense of the letter of the Word.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>They shall fear Thee with the sun and before the moon, a generation of generations. In His days shall the righteous flourish; and much peace till the moon be no more. His name shall be to eternity; before the sun shall He have the name of Son; and all nations shall be blessed in Him (<a href="../njhd/21.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 21</a>). This, therefore, is what is signified by "till the moon be no more," that is, with those who are meant by "the righteous in whom there is much peace." But in the highest sense, by these words the Lord in relation to His Divine Human, that this shall be the Divine good of the Divine love, is meant, therefore it is also added, "before the sun He shall have the name of Son," "Son" meaning the Lord's Divine Human. And as "nations" mean all who are in good, or who receive the good of love from the Lord, it is said, "and all nations shall be blessed in Him." (That "nations" signify those who are in good, and "peoples" those who are in truths, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>.)</p><p>[10] In Isaiah:<p>There shall be upon every high mountain and upon every lofty hill streams, rivulets of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers shall fall. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days (<a href="../lj/56.htm">The Last Judgment 56</a>, <a href="../lj/58.htm">58</a>). That to those who are in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor it shall then be given to understand truths, is signified by "there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every lofty hill streams, rivulets of waters." Those "upon a high mountain" mean those who are in the good of love to the Lord, "high mountain" signifying that good; those "upon the lofty hill" mean those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor, "hill" signifying that good; "streams, rivulets of water" signify intelligence from truths. That there shall then be truth in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as before there was truth in the celestial kingdom, and that the truth in the celestial kingdom shall then become the good of love is meant by "the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days;" for "light" means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, "the light of the moon" Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom, and "the light of the sun" Divine truth in the celestial kingdom; "sevenfold" signifies full and perfect, and truth is full and perfect when it becomes good, or good in form. It can be seen that this means, not the sun and moon on the earth, but the sun and moon in the heavens. It is to be known that when a last judgment is being effected the Lord appears in the heavens in much greater effulgence and splendor than at other times, and this because the angels there must be more powerfully defended; for lower things, with which the exteriors of the angels have communication, are then in a state of disturbance. Therefore, as the Last Judgment is here treated of, it is said, "the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days;" and therefore it is also said that "there shall be streams, rivulets of waters, upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill," which signifies abundant intelligence with those who are upon the higher mountains and higher hills, for on the lower mountains and hills is where the judgment then takes place. (That the Lord appears to those who are in His celestial kingdom as a sun, and to those who are in his spiritual kingdom as a moon, see in the work on <a href="../hh/116.htm">Heaven and Hell 116-125</a>; and that the light from these is Divine truth, n. <a href="../hh/127.htm">127-140</a>)</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw; for Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>).<p>This treats of the Lord, and of the new heaven and new earth, that is, of the church to be established by Him. That to those in that church the good of love to the Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbor should not perish is meant by "thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw;" for to those who are in the good of love to the Lord He appears as a sun, and to those who are in truths from the good of charity towards the neighbor He appears as a moon; so "thy sun" signifies the good of love to the Lord, and "thy moon" the good of charity, which, in its essence, is truth from good. That they shall continue to eternity in truths from the good of love, and in truths from the good of charity is meant by "Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled," "the light of eternity" is predicated of those who are in the good of love to the Lord, and "fulfilling the days of mourning" of those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor, or in truths from good; for with those who were of the ancient churches, "mourning" represented grief on account of the loss or destruction of truth and good; "fulfilled" signifies ended, thus that they shall be in truths from good. From this the signification of "the sun became as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood," can be seen, namely, that the good of love to the Lord was separated, and thus truth was falsified.</p><p>[12] Nearly the same is signified in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Behold the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel with indignation and the glow of anger, to lay the earth waste; and He shall destroy its sinners out of it. For the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof do not shine with their light; the sun is darkened in its rising, and the moon maketh not her light to be bright. I will visit evil upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-11</a>).<p>"The day of Jehovah, cruel with indignation and the glow of anger," signifies the day of the Last Judgment; "the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof do not shine with their light, the sun is darkened in its rising, and the moon maketh not her light to be bright," signifies that the knowledges of good and truth have perished, as well as the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity towards the neighbor, and thence the truth that is called the truth of faith; for "stars" signify the knowledges of good, "constellations" the knowledges of truth, "the sun" the good of love to the Lord, and "the moon" the good of charity towards the neighbor, which, in its essence, is truth from good, and is called the truth of faith. The sun is said "to be darkened in its rising," and the moon "not to make her light to be bright;" not that the sun and moon in the angelic heavens are darkened, for the sun there is always in its effulgence, and the moon in its splendor; but before those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom, goods and truths are thus obscured; it is therefore according to the appearance that it is so said, for those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom turn themselves away from the good of love and charity, consequently from the Lord, and then they will nothing but evil and think nothing but falsity, and those who will and think no other, see nothing but thick darkness and darkness in such things as pertain to heaven and the church. Because such are meant by those with whom "the sun is darkened, and the moon maketh not her light to be bright," it is said, "to lay the earth waste, and He shall destroy its sinners out of it," and afterwards, "I will visit evil upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity," "earth" and "world" signifying the church, "laying it waste" signifying that there is no longer any good, and "visiting evil upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity," signifying the Last Judgment.</p><p>[13] In Ezekiel:<p>When I shall extinguish thee I will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries of light in the heavens will I make black over thee, and I will give darkness upon thy land (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>).<p>This is said of Pharaoh king of Egypt, by whom is here signified the natural man separate from the spiritual; which when it is separated is wholly in thick darkness and in darkness in regard to all things of heaven and the church, and so far as it is separated denies them; for the natural man sees nothing in such things from itself, but only through the spiritual man from the Lord, since the natural man is in the heat and light of the world, while the spiritual man is in the heat and light of heaven. From this it is clear what is meant by the particulars here, namely, "When I extinguish thee I will cover the heavens" signifies the interiors, which are in the light of heaven; "I will make the stars thereof black" signifies the knowledges of good and truth; "I will cover the sun with a cloud" signifies the good of love to the Lord; "the moon shall not make her light to shine" signifies the good of charity towards the neighbor and the truth of faith therefrom; "all the luminaries of light will I make black over thee" signifies all truths; and "I will give darkness upon thy land" signifies falsities.</p><p>[14] In Joel:<p>The day of Jehovah cometh. A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity. Before Him the earth trembleth, the sun and the moon were black, and the stars withdrew their brightness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_10.htm">10</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The day of Jehovah is near in the valley cut off. The sun and the moon were made black, and the stars withdrew their brightness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_14.htm">Joel 3:14-15</a>).<p>In the Gospels:<p>Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_24.htm">Mark 13:24-25</a>).<p>In Revelation:<p>The fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; and the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for the third part of it, and the night likewise (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_12.htm">Revelation 8:12</a>).<p>In another place:<p>Out of the pit of the abyss there went up a smoke as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun was darkened and the air by the smoke (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a>).<p>It is clear from what has been said above, that in these passages "the sun and moon made black and darkened" means that there was no longer any good or any truth; therefore they are not further explained.</p><p>[15] Because such things are signified by "the sun darkened," therefore the sun was darkened when the Lord was upon the cross, because He was entirely rejected by the church that then was with the Jews, who were consequently in dense darkness, or in falsities. This is thus described in Luke:<p>At the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour, for the sun was darkened (<a href="../ae/64.htm">64</a>, <a href="../ae/83.htm">83</a>, <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>c at the end.)</p><p>[16] In Micah:<p>Jehovah said against the prophets that cause the people to err, It shall be night unto you for vision; and darkness shall be to you for divination; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall grow black over them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_3_5.htm">Micah 3:5-6</a>).<p>What these words signify in the spiritual sense, may be seen above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>).<p>This signifies that in the church, where the Word is from which it might be known what is good and true, there is nevertheless nothing but evil and falsity. "To cause the sun to set," and "to darken the earth" signify the evil of life, and the falsity of doctrine in the church; for "the rising of the sun" signifies the good of love, which is the good of the life, and "the setting of the sun" signifies the evil of love, which is the evil of the life; and "the darkening of the earth" signifies the consequent falsity of doctrine, "darkness" signifying falsities, and "the earth" the church; "at noon," and "in the day of light" signify when there might be the knowledges of good and truth, because they have the Word, "noon" signifying where there are the knowledges of good, and the "day of light" where there are the knowledges of truth. Such knowledges as are from the Word are meant, because it is the church where the Word is that is here treated of.</p><p>[17] In Habakkuk:<p>The mountains were moved; the overflowing of waters passed by. Sun and moon stood in their habitation; Thine arrows go forth in light, the lightning of Thy spear in brightness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10-11</a>).<p>This chapter treats of the Lord's coming and of the Last Judgment then accomplished by Him; "the mountains were moved, the overflowing of waters passed by" signifies that those who were in the love of self and the world were cast out by the falsities of evil into which they were let; "mountains" signifying the loves of self and the world, and "the overflowing of waters" to be let into falsities from those loves, "waters" meaning falsities, and "overflowing" to be let into them. That by those in that state genuine truths and goods are not seen, but instead of these, fatuous truths and goods, which in themselves are falsities and evils is signified by, "Thine arrows go forth in light, the lightning of Thy spear in brightness;" "arrows" or "lightnings" signifying fatuous truths, which in themselves are falsities, and "the lightning of the spear" signifying fatuous goods which in themselves are the evils of falsity. Moreover, such signs appear in the spiritual world, in the case of those who are in falsities from the loves of self and the world, when the Last Judgment takes place, and these are cast out.</p><p>[18] As in this prophecy it is said, "Sun and moon stood in their habitation," the significance of the sun's resting in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Aijalon shall also be explained, which is thus described in Joshua:<p>Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah, and he said in the eyes of Israel, Sun, rest thou in Gibeon; and thou, moon, in the valley of Aijalon; and the sun rested, and the moon stayed, until the nation was avenged upon its enemies. Is not this written upon the book of the Upright? And the sun stood in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day (Jos. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>).<p>That the sun is said to have stood in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Aijalon, signifies that the church was altogether vastated in respect to all good and truth, for a battle was then going on against the king of Jerusalem and the kings of the Amorites; and "the king of Jerusalem" signifies the truth of the church wholly vastated by falsities, and "the kings of the Amorites" signify the good of the church vastated by evils; therefore those kings were smitten with hailstones, which signify the dire falsities of evil. It is said that the sun and the moon stood in their place, that is, before the sons of Israel, that they might see their enemies; but this, although it is told as history is a prophecy, as is evident from its being said, "Is not this written upon the book of the Upright?" which was a prophetical book from which this was taken; so it was from the same book that it was said, "Until the nation was avenged upon its enemies," and not, "Until the sons of Israel were avenged upon their enemies," the term "nation" being used prophetically. This is evident also from the fact that if this miracle had occurred altogether in this way, the whole nature of the world would have been inverted, which is not the case with the other miracles in the Word. That it might be known, therefore, that this was said prophetically, it is added, "Is not this written upon the book of the Upright?" And yet it is not to be doubted, that there was given to them a light out of heaven, a light in Gibeon like that of the sun, and a light in the valley of Aijalon like that of the moon.</p><p>[19] In Jeremiah:<p>She that hath borne seven shall languish, she shall breathe out her soul; her sun shall go down while it is yet day, it shall be ashamed and blush; and the remnant of them will I give to the sword before their enemies (<a href="../ae/257.htm">257</a>. "Her sun shall go down while it is yet day" signifies that the good of the church is about to perish, although the church has the Word, and might through the Word be in light; "it, namely, the sun, shall be ashamed and blush" signifies because good and truth are not received, but evil and falsity (as is evident also from the next quotation from Isaiah); "the remnant of them will I give to the sword before their enemies" signifies that all the remaining good and truth will perish through the falsity from evil; "remnant" meaning all that remains; "to be given to the sword" meaning to perish on account of falsities; "enemies" meaning evils.</p><p>[20] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah will visit upon the host of the height in the height, and upon the Kings of the earth who are upon the earth. Then the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">23</a>).<p>"To visit" signifies to destroy, because visitation precedes judgment, when those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom are destroyed; "the host of the height in the height" signifies all evils that are from the love of self, "host" signifying all evils; "the kings of the earth" falsities of every kind, and "the earth" the church. This makes clear the signification of "Jehovah will visit upon the host of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the earth who are upon the earth." It is said "upon the host of the height in the height" because those who are in the love of self seek in the spiritual world high places; "then the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed," signifies that there is no longer any reception of Divine truth and Divine good, "moon" and "sun" signifying the truth of faith and the good of love, and these are said "to blush and be ashamed" when they are no longer received, but falsity and evil are received in their place.</p><p>[21] In David:<p>Jehovah, who hath made the heavens by His intelligence, who hath spread out the earth upon the waters; who hath made great luminaries, the sun for rule by day, the moon and stars for rule by night: Who hath smitten Egypt in their firstborn, and hath brought out Israel from the midst of them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_136_5.htm">Psalms 136:5-11</a>).<p>He who knows nothing of the spiritual sense of the Word must suppose that there is nothing involved in these words except what appears in the sense of the letter; and yet every particular involves such things as pertain to angelic wisdom, which are all celestial Divine and spiritual Divine things. This describes the new creation, or regeneration of the men of the church, of whom the church consists; "the heavens" which Jehovah hath made by His intelligence, signify the internal things of the men of the church, which, in one expression, are called the spiritual man, where intelligence has its seat, and where their heaven is; "the earth" which He hath spread out upon the waters, signifies the external of the church, which in one expression, is called the natural man; this is said to be "spread out upon the waters" because there the truths are by which man is regenerated, "waters" meaning truths; "the great luminaries, the sun, moon, and stars," signify the good of love, truth from that good, and the knowledges of good and truth, "the sun," the good of love, "the moon" truth from that good, and "the stars" the knowledges of good and truth. The sun is said to have been made "for rule by day," because "day" signifies the light of the spiritual man, for the spiritual man has illustration and perception from the good of love; the moon and the stars are said to have been made "for rule by night," because "night" signifies the light of the natural man, and its light, as compared with the light of the spiritual man, is like the light of night from the moon and the stars as compared with the light of day from the sun. Because this treats of the regeneration of the men of the church it follows, "who hath smitten Egypt in their firstborn, and hath brought out Israel from the midst of them;" "Egypt" signifying the natural man, such as it is by birth, namely, in mere falsities from evil; "their firstborn" mean primary things; the destruction of these while man is being regenerated is meant by "who hath smitten Egypt in their firstborn;" "Israel" signifies the spiritual man; and "to bring him out from the midst of them" signifies to open the spiritual man, and thus to regenerate; for the Lord regenerates the man of the church by dispersing the falsities from evils that are in the natural man, and by opening the spiritual man, and this is effected by the Lord by means of spiritual light, which is Divine truth.</p><p>[22] Like things are signified by these words in Genesis:<p>God made two great luminaries; the great luminary to rule by day, and the lesser luminary to rule by night, and the stars (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>).<p>For that chapter treats of the new creation, or the regeneration of the men of whom the Most Ancient Church consisted, and this is described in the sense of the letter, by the creation of heaven and earth. Like things are signified, too, by these words in Jeremiah:<p>Thus said the Lord Jehovih <sup>2</sup>who giveth the sun for light by day, the statutes of the moon and stars for light by night (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>).<p>"The statutes of the moon and stars" signify all things that are done in the natural man according to the laws of order.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>Praise ye Jehovah, all His angels; praise ye Him, all His hosts; praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light; praise Him, ye heavens of heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_2.htm">Psalms 148:2-4</a>).<p>"To praise Jehovah" signifies to worship Him; "angels" signify those who are in Divine truths from the good of love, for such are angels; "all the hosts" signify goods and truths in the whole complex; "sun and moon" signify the good of love and the truth from that good; "the stars of light" signify the knowledges of truth from good; "the heavens of heavens" signify goods and truths both internal and external; and as man worships the Lord from those things that are with him from the Lord, thus from the goods and truths that are with him, and as man is a man from these, therefore it is said to them, namely, to the sun, moon, and stars, which signify goods and truths, that they "shall praise," that is, worship, Jehovah. Who does not know that the sun, moon, and stars do not praise, that is, worship?</p><p>[24] In Moses:<p>Of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be His land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that lieth beneath, and for the precious things of the increase of the sun, and for the precious things of the produce of the months (<a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>.)</p><p>[25] In Isaiah:<p>I will make thy suns a ruby, and thy gates of stones of carbuncles, and all thy border of stones of desire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>).<p>This is said of the nations outside of the church, from whom a new church was to be established by the Lord. "I will make thy suns a ruby" signifies that goods will be brilliant from the fire of love, "suns" here meaning the goods of love, and "the ruby" meaning a brilliance as from fire; "I will make thy gates of stones of carbuncles" signifies that truths will be resplendent from good, "gates" meaning introductory truths, in particular the doctrines that are from good, for all truths of doctrine that are genuine proceed from good, and are of good; and "stones of carbuncles" signify their brightness from good; in fact, all precious stones signify truths from good, and their color, brightness, and fire indicate the quality of the truth from good. "I will make all their border of stones of desire" signifies that true knowledges, which belong to the natural man, will be pleasant and enjoyable from good; for "border" has the same meaning as "foundation," and this means the natural man, for in the things in it the goods and truths of the spiritual man are terminated, and "stones of desire" mean truths pleasant and enjoyable from good; by these are meant the goods and truths of the Word which those who constitute the new church will have, and which will be such. That the "sun" signifies the good of love is evident, too, from their being called "suns," in the plural.</p><p>[26] In Job:<p>Was I glad because my means were great, and because my hand had found much? did I behold the light that it shone, and the moon that it walked in brightness? and hath my heart secretly misled itself, and my hand kissed my mouth? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_31_25.htm">Job 31:25-28</a>).<p>These words mean in the spiritual sense that he had not acquired for himself intelligence from what was his own [ex proprio], and had taken no merit to himself for his intelligence, and had not gloried in it; for "Was I glad because my means were great, and because my hand had found much?" signifies, had he gloried over having intelligence, and having acquired it for himself from what was his own "means" signify the knowledges of good and truth, by which intelligence is gained; "and because my hand had found much" signifies to have acquired from what is one's own; "did I behold the light that it shone, and the moon that it walked in brightness" signifies to have spiritual truths, which constitute intelligence, "light" and the "moon" signifying spiritual truths; "hath my heart secretly misled itself, and my hand kissed my mouth?" signifies, have I therefore gloried inwardly, and have I claimed them to myself?</p><p>[27] In Matthew:<p>That ye may be sons of your Father who is in the heavens; who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).<p>This treats of charity towards the neighbor, as is evident from what there precedes and follows, and, in particular of the Jews, who accounted the Gentiles as enemies, and their own people as friends. That they ought to love the Gentiles the same as their own people the Lord makes clear by this comparison; but as all comparisons in the Word are from correspondences, and from that are significative, as other things are that are not said comparatively, so it is with this comparison; and "the Father in the heavens maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" signifies that the Lord flows in from heaven with the Divine good of love and with Divine truth, with those who are outside of the Jewish church as much as with those who are within it, "sun" also here signifying the good of love, and "rain" the Divine truth. "The evil and the unjust" signify in the internal sense those who were of the Jewish Church, since they did not receive; and "the good and the just" signify those who were outside of that church and did receive. In general, all the evil and the good, and the just and the unjust, are here meant, for the Lord flows in with good and truth equally with all, but all do not receive equally.</p><p>[28] Because "the sun" signifies the Lord in relation to Divine love, He is called "the Sun of righteousness (in <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141</a>, <a href="../hh/148.htm">148-150</a>; and that "the north" means truth in obscurity, in the same chapter, n <a href="../hh/148.htm">148-150</a>; for the Four Quarters in the Spiritual World are there treated of.)<p>Again, "the setting of the sun" signifies the state of the church when it is in ignorance, which is its first state; and "the rising of the sun" signifies its state when it is in light. "The setting of the sun" also signifies the state of the church when it is in evils and falsities therefrom; and "the rising of the sun" when it is in goods and in truths therefrom.</p><p>[29] The first state of the church, when it is still in ignorance, is signified by the commencement of the passover in the evening when the sun was set, according to these words of Moses:<p>Thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, when the sun shall have set in the stated time of thy going forth out of Egypt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7093.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7093</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7867.htm">7867</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9286.htm">9286-9292</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10655.htm">10655</a>). And because the first state of regeneration is a state of ignorance, the beginning of that feast was "at even, when the sun had set." Again, that state is signified by "the going forth of the sons of Israel out of Egypt," for in Egypt they were in a servile state, and thus in a state of ignorance; therefore it is said, "in the stated time of the going forth out of Egypt."</p><p>[30] The last state of the church, when the church is in falsities and evils, for this state is its last, is signified by "the setting of the sun" in Moses:<p>When the sun was about setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror and great darkness fell upon him. At length, when the sun had set, and it had become dark, behold, a furnace of smoke, and a torch of fire that passed through between these pieces (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_15_17.htm">17</a>).<p>These things are said of the posterity of Abram from Jacob, that is, of the Israelitish and Jewish nation; and "when the sun was about setting," and "at length, when the sun had set," signify the last state of the church in that nation, that they were in mere falsities and evils; "great darkness" and "a furnace of smoke," signify falsities from evil; and "a torch of fire" signifies the dire love of self, from which came their evils and falsities.</p><p>[31] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so have "sun" and "moon" and in that sense "sun" signifies the love of self, and "moon," the falsities therefrom. "Sun and moon" have this signification because those who are in natural thought only, and not in spiritual thought, do not think beyond nature; therefore when they see that from these two luminaries, or from their light and heat, all things arise and, as it were, live upon the earth, they suppose that these luminaries rule the universe; above this they do not raise their thoughts. This all do who are in the love of self and in the evils and falsities therefrom, for such are merely natural and sensual men, and the merely natural and sensual man does not think beyond nature, for what he does not see and touch he believes to be nothing.<p>With the ancients, all things of the church consisted of the representatives of spiritual things in natural; with them therefore, "the sun" signified the Lord in relation to Divine good, and "the moon" the Lord in relation to Divine truth, consequently in worship they turned their faces to the rising of the sun; and those among them who were in the love of self, and were therefore merely natural and sensual, began to worship as their highest gods the sun and the moon that they saw with their eyes; but because those alone did this, or persuaded others to do it, who were in the love of self and in the evils and falsities therefrom, therefore "the sun" signifies the love of self, and "the moon" the falsity therefrom. This becomes still more evident in the case of spirits in the other life who in the world had been such; these turn the face away from the Lord, and turn it towards something there that is dark and in thick darkness, which is in the place of the sun and moon of the world, over against the sun and moon of the angelic heaven (on which more may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/122.htm">Heaven and Hell 122</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>). By persons like this the worship of the sun and moon was instituted in ancient times, when all Divine worship was representative; but at this day, when representatives have ceased, the worship of the sun and moon does not exist in the Christian world, but in its place the worship of self, which exists with those in whom the love of ruling predominates. This makes clear the signification of "sun and moon" in the contrary sense.</p><p>[32] That in ancient times the sun and moon were worshiped is evident from the fact that the Gentiles dedicated shrines to them, which are spoken of in many histories. That the Egyptians as well as the Jews and Israelites worshiped the sun and moon is evident from the Word. That the Egyptians did, see in Jeremiah:<p>The King of Babylon shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt, and shall break in pieces the pillars of the house of the sun in the land of Egypt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_43_11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_43_13.htm">13</a>).<p>That the Jews and Israelites did, see in Ezekiel:<p>I held their faces towards the east; and the same bowed themselves towards the rising of the sun (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>).<p>This treats of the abominations of Jerusalem. In the second book of Kings:<p>Josiah <sup>3</sup>the King put down the idolatrous priests, them that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, to the moon, and to the stars, and to all of the hosts of the heavens. He furthermore took away the horses that the Kings of Judah had set up to the sun at the entering in of the house of Jehovah, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_23_5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_23_11.htm">11</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>They shall bring out the bones of the Kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, and the bones of his priests, and the bones of his prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and they shall spread them to the sun and the moon and all the host of the heavens, which they have loved, and which they have served (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>);<p>and also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_25.htm">25</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_4_19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_3.htm">17:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">5</a>.</p><p>[33] Because "Moab" in the Word signifies those who are in a life of falsity from the love of self, and their worship signifies the worship of self, therefore when the Israelitish people drew near to the worship of the Moabitish people, it was commanded that the chiefs of the people should be hung up before the sun; respecting which it is thus written in Moses:<p>The daughters of Moab called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. Especially did Israel join himself unto Baalpeor; therefore Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up before the sun (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2468.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2468</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8315.htm">8315</a>).</p><p>[34] From this it is also clear that the sun of the world signifies the love of self. Because the love of self lets man down into what is his own [proprium] and holds him there, for it looks continually to self, and man's own is nothing but evil, and from evil comes every falsity, therefore "the heat of the sun" signifies adulterated truth, which in its essence is the falsity of evil. This is signified by "the heat of the sun" in the following passages. In Revelation:<p>The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto him to scorch men with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a>).<p>And elsewhere:<p>They shall hunger no more, neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_16.htm">Revelation 7:16</a>).<p>In David:<p>The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil, He shall keep thy soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_121_6.htm">Psalms 121:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_121_7.htm">7</a>).<p>The "sun" here means the love of self, and the "moon" the falsity therefrom; because from that love is all evil, and from evil all falsity, therefore it is said, "Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil, and He shall keep thy soul," "soul" signifying the life of truth.</p><p>[35] In Matthew:<p>Other seeds fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth; and when the sun was risen they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_5.htm">Matthew 13:5-6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_4_5.htm">Mark 4:5-6</a>).<p>"Seeds" signify the truths from the Word, that is, the truths man receives from the Lord, for it is afterwards said, that it is "the Son of man that soweth." "Rocky places" signify a historical faith, which is another's faith in oneself, which is believing a thing to be true, not because one sees it in himself, but because another in whom he has confidence has said it. "Earth" signifies spiritual good, because this receives truths as soil does seeds; "the sun's rising" signifies the love of self; and "to be scorched" and "to wither away" signify to be adulterated and to perish. This makes clear what is signified by these words of the Lord in series, namely, that the truths that are implanted from infancy from the Word or from preaching, when man begins to think from himself, are adulterated and perish by lusts from the love of self. All things in the Word are, indeed, truths, but they are adulterated by the ideas of thought concerning them, and by the way they are applied, consequently with such persons truths are not truths except in respect to the mere utterance of them. This is so because all the life of truth is from spiritual good, and spiritual good has its seat in the higher or interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind. This mind cannot be opened with those who are in the love of self, for in everything they look to self. If they lift their eyes to heaven, still the thought of their spirit is held in the consideration of self; consequently from the fire of its own glory it incites the external and corporeal sensual things which have been taught from childhood, to the imitation of such affections as belong to the spiritual man.</p><p>[36] It is written in Jonah that "the gourd that came up over him withered, and that the sun beat upon his head, so that he fell sick." As this cannot be understood without explanation by the internal sense, it shall be explained in a few words. It is thus told in Jonah:<p>Jehovah prepared a gourd that came up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his evil, and Jonah was glad over the gourd. And God prepared a worm, when the dawn came up the following day, and it smote the gourd that it dried up. And it came to pass when the sun arose that God prepared a scorching east wind; and the sun smote upon the head of Jonah, and he fell sick so that he asked that his soul might die. Then God said to Jonah, is it well for thee to be angry over the gourd? He said, It is well for me to be angry, even unto death. Jehovah said, Thou wouldest spare the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, nor didst thou make it grow up, because thou didst become the son of the night <sup>4</sup>and the son of night perisheth; shall not I spare Nineveh, the great city, in which are more than twelve myriads <sup>5</sup>of men? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_4_6.htm">Jonah 4:6-11</a>).<p>This is a description of the genius of the Jewish nation, that they are in the love of self and in falsities therefrom. Jonah was of that nation, and therefore also was sent to Nineveh; for the Jewish nation had the Word, and was therefore able to teach those who were outside of the church and who are called Gentiles; these are signified by "Nineveh." Because the Jewish nation was, above others, in the love of self and in the falsities from that love, they did not wish well to any but themselves, thus not to the Gentiles, but these they hated. Because that nation was such, and Jonah represented it, he was very angry that Jehovah should spare Nineveh, for it is said:<p>Jonah was ill with a great illness, so that he was angry, and from the illness of anger he said, Take, O Jehovah, my soul from me, for my death is better than my life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_4_1.htm">Jonah 4:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_4_3.htm">3</a>).<p>This evil in that nation is signified by the gourd which the worm smote so that it dried up. "The sun that smote upon the head of Jonah" signifies the love of self which was in that nation; and "the scorching east wind" the falsity therefrom; and "the worm that smote the gourd" signifies the destruction of this evil and the falsity thence. That this is the signification of "the gourd" is evident from its being said in this description that Jonah at first "was glad over the gourd," and after the gourd had been smitten by the worm and had dried up that "he was angry over it, even unto death," and also from its being said that "he had pity over the gourd." That the Jewish nation, because it was in such a love and in such falsity therefrom was liable to damnation is meant by these words to Jonah, "thou didst not cause it to grow up, because thou didst become a son of night, <sup>6</sup>and a son of night perisheth." (That such was the Jewish nation, see <a href="../njhd/248.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>.)</p><p>[37] The love of self is signified here and in the preceding passages, because "the sun" in the genuine spiritual sense signifies love to the Lord, and the love of self is the opposite of this love.<p>Moreover, the Lord's Divine love, which is present with everyone, is turned into the love of self with the evil; for everything that flows in is changed in the recipient subject into what agrees with its own nature; as the pure heat of the sun is turned into an offensive smell in subjects of such a nature, and the pure light of the sun into hideous colors in objects of such reception; this is why "the sun that smote upon the head of Jonah" signifies the love of self that is in him; likewise "the sun that was risen" by which the seeds were scorched upon the rocky places, mentioned in Matthew.</p><p>[38] In Revelation:<p>The city New Jerusalem hath no need of the sun and moon to shine in it, for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>).<p>"The sun" here, of which the city New Jerusalem shall have no need, signifies natural love, which, viewed in itself is the love of self and the world; and "the moon" signifies natural light, for natural light, viewed in itself is from natural love, and the quality of the light is according to the quality of the love; while spiritual love and spiritual light are signified by "the glory of God shall lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof."</p><p>[39] That such is the sense of these words is very evident from the following from Isaiah:<p>The sun shall be no more a light to thee by day, and for brightness the moon shall not give light unto thee; but Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and thy God for thine adornment. Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw; for Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>).<p>In the first part of this passage "the sun and moon" have the same meaning as above in Revelation, namely, "the sun" signifies merely natural love, and "the moon" natural light therefrom; but in the latter part of the passage "the sun and moon" mean the sun and moon of the angelic heaven, and that sun signifies the Lord's Divine love, and the moon Divine truth, as was explained above. For it is first said, "the sun shall be no more a light to thee by day, and for brightness the moon shall not give light unto thee;" and afterwards it is said, "thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw." From all this it is now evident what "sun and moon" signify in both senses.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "my," as also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_23_1.htm">2 Kings 23</a> is "Josiah."<p>4.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "because thou didst become the son of death, and the son of death perished;" the Hebrew has, "which was the son of a night and perished a son of the night."<br><br>5.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "thousands;" the Hebrew has "myriads."<br><br>6.&nbsp;Cf. 887. </p>

Causa quod ita, est quia omnis vita veri est ex bono spirituali, et bonum spirituale residet in mente superiore seu interiore, quae vocatur mens spiritualis; haec mens non aperiri potest apud illos qui in amore sui sunt, nam in singulis spectant ad se; si elevant oculos suos ad caelum, usque tamen cogitatio spiritus eorum haeret in intuitione sui, et inde ex igne gloriae suae excitat sensualia externa et corporea, quae a pueritia edocta sunt, ad imitandum affectiones quales sunt spirituali homini.</p><p>[36] Legitur apud Jonam quod "exaresceret kikajon qui ascendet super illum, et quod percuteret sol caput ejus ut aegre haberet"; haec quia non intelliguntur absque explicatione per sensum internum, paucis explicanda sunt: de his ita legitur apud Jonam,<p>"Jehovah... praeparavit kikajonem, qui ascendit super Jonam, ut esset umbra super capite ejus, ad avertendum malum illius, et Jona laetatus super kikajone...; et praeparavit Deus vermem cum ascenderet aurora die postero, qui percussit kikajonem ut exaresceret: insuper factum est cum oriretur sol, ut praepararet Deus ventum orientalem exsiccantem, et percuteret sol caput Jonae, et aegrehaberet; unde petiit animae suae mori... Tunc dixit Deus ad Jonam, Num juste exarsit tibi super kikajone? Dixit, Juste exarsit mihi usque ad mortem. Dixit Jehovah, Tu clementia usus es super kikajone, in quo non laborasti; non perfectum fecisti, quia filius <sup>15</sup></p><p>noctis factus es, et filius <sup>16</sup></p><p>noctis perit. Ego non clementia utar super Ninive, urbe magna, in qua sunt plures quam duodecim <sup>17</sup></p><p>myriades hominum?"

Quia gens Judaica erat prae aliis in amore sui et in falsis ex illo amore, inde non aliis bene voluerunt quam sibi ipsis, non autem gentibus, sed has oderunt; et quia talis fuit illa gens et Jonas repraesentavit illam, ideo exarsit illi valde quod Jehovah pepercerit Ninive; nam dicitur,<p>"Aegre fuit Jonae aegritudine magna, ita ut exarserit illi", et ex aegritudine irae dixerit, "Sume Jehovah animam meam a me, quia bona mors mea prae vita mea" vers. 1, 3):<p>hoc malum apud illam gentem significatur per "kikajonem", quem vermis percussit ut exaresceret: per "solem qui percuteret caput Jonae" significatur amor sui qui fuit illi genti, et per "ventum orientalem exsiccantem" falsum inde, et per "vermem" qui percussit kikajonem significatur destructio mali et inde falsi: quod hoc per "kikajonem" significetur, patet ex his in descriptione illa, quod Jonas primum "laetatus sit super kikajonem", et postquam kikajon "percussus esset a verme et exaruisset", quod "exarserit illi usque ad mortem", et ex eo quod dicatur quod "clementia usus esset super kikajone." Quod gens Judaica, quia in tali amore et in tali inde falso, damnationi obnoxia sit, intelligitur per haec verba ad Jonam "Non perfectum fecisti, quia filius <sup>19</sup></p><p>noctis factus es, et filius <sup>20</sup></p><p>noctis perit." (Qualis gens Judaica fuerat, videatur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_401/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_248" target=_top>248</a>.)</p><p>[37] Quod amor sui hic et in praecedentibus locis significetur, est quia per "solem" In genuino spirituali sensu significatur amor in Dominum, et huic amori oppositus est amor sui; etiam Amor Divinus Domini, qui est praesens apud unumquemvis, vertitur in amorem sui apud malos, nam omne influens in subjecto recipiente vertitur in conveniens suae naturae; prout calor solis purus in graveolentia in subjectis talis naturae, et lux solis pura in tetros colores in objectis talis receptionis: inde est quod per "solem qui percussit caput Jonae" significetur amor sui, nempe in illo; et quoque apud Matthaeum, per "solem exortum", quo exusta sunt semina super petrosis.</p><p>[38] In Apocalypsi,<p>"Civitas" Nova Hierosolyma "non opus habet sole et luna, ut luceant in illa, gloria enim Dei illustrat illam, et lucerna ejus Agnus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_401/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_23" target=_top>21:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_401/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_5" target=_top>22:5</a>):<p>per "solem" ibi, quo non opus habebit civitas Nova Hierosolyma, significatur amor naturalis, qui in se spectatus est amor sui et mundi; et per "lunam" significatur lumen naturale, nam lumen naturale in se spectatum est ex amore naturali, et quale luminis secundum quale amoris: at amor spiritualis et lux spiritualis significatur per quod "gloria Dei illustrabit illam, et lucerna ejus Agnus."</p><p>[39] Quod talis sensus illorum verborum sit, patet manifeste ex his apud Esaiam,<p>"Non erit tibi sol amplius in lucem interdiu, et in splendorem luna non lucebit tibi, sed erit tibi Jehovah in lucem aeternitatis, et Deus tuus in decus tuum: non occidet amplius Sol tuus, et Luna tua non colligetur, quia Jehovah erit tibi in lucem aeternitatis, et implebuntur dies luctus tui" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_401/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_19" target=_top>60:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_401/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_20" target=_top>20</a>):<p>similia per "solem et lunam in priori loco <sup>21</sup></p><p>significantur quae supra in Apocalypsi, nempe per "solem" amor mere naturalis, et per "lunam" lumen naturale inde: at per "Solem et Lunam" in posteriori loco intelligitur Sol et Luna caeli angelici, et per "Solem" illum significatur Divinus Amor Domini, et per "Lunam" Divinum Verum, ut supra explicatum est; nam primum dicitur, "Non erit tibi amplius sol in lucem interdiu, et in splendorem luna non lucebit tibi"; et postea dicitur, "Non occidet amplius Sol tuus, et Luna tua non colligetur."
