<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 26</h4><p>26. (Verse <a href="../ae/10.htm">10</a>.) They therefore, who think of the Lord's Human and not at the same time of His Divine, will on no account admit the expression "Divine Human;" for they think separately of His Human and of His Divine, which is like thinking of a man separately from his soul or life, which, however, would not be to think of the man at all; still less of the Lord. Because such a separate idea is in their thought, they pray the Father to have compassion for the sake of the Son; when, nevertheless, the Lord Himself should be prayed to have compassion, in whom, according to the universal doctrine of the church, the Divine is such as that of the Father; for that doctrine teaches, that as the Father, so also the Son, is uncreate, infinite, eternal, almighty, God, and Lord; and neither is before or after the other, nor greater or less than the other (from the Athanasian Creed). This is also in accordance with the doctrine taught by the Lord Himself, which is; That He and the Father are one; and that he who seeth Him seeth the Father, because He is in the Father and the Father in Him; that He is the way, the truth, and the life; and that no one cometh to the Father but by Him. It is therefore evident how much they turn aside from the way and from the truth, who pass by the Lord, and approach the Father directly. But as I have conversed a good deal upon this subject with angels, and also with spirits, who, when they lived in the world, belonged to the Reformed Church, and some to the Papal religion, I wish to relate these things in the following pages; from which it will be seen what kind of light the church would have concerning the Divine, which is its first and primary, if the Divine Human of the Lord were acknowledged and believed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 26</h4><p>26. Verse 5. And from Jesus Christ, signifies from the Lord as to the Divine Human. This is evident from the fact that such was the Lord's name in the world; thus the name of His Human; but in respect to the Divine, His name was "Jehovah" and "God." It is called the Divine Human because the Lord made His Human Divine when He was in the world; for He united it to His Divine which was in Him from conception, and which was to Him a soul from the Father, thus which was to Him His life; for the soul of everyone is his life, and the body, which is the human, lives therefrom; when, therefore, the Divine was united to the Human in the Lord, as soul to body, it is called the Divine Human. (That it is according to the doctrine of the church that as soul and body make one man, so the Divine and the Human make one Christ, as also that His Divine and His Human make one person, see above, n. <a href="../ae/10.htm">10</a>.) They, therefore, who think of the Lord's Human and not at the same time of His Divine, will on no account admit the expression Divine Human, for they think of the Human separately and of the Divine separately, thus, as it were, of a man separately from his soul or his life; this, however, is not to think of the man at all, still less of the Lord.</p><p>[2] Because such a separate idea is in their thought, they pray to the Father to have compassion for the sake of the Son; when, nevertheless, the Lord Himself ought to be prayed to that He may have compassion, in whom, according to the universal doctrine of the church, the Divine is such as the Father has; for that doctrine teaches, that as the Father, so also the Son, is uncreate, infinite, eternal, almighty, God, and Lord; and neither is before or after the other, nor greater or less than the other (from the Athanasian Creed). This also is in accordance with the doctrine given by the Lord Himself, which is: That He and the Father are one; and that he who seeth Him seeth the Father, because He is in the Father and the Father in Him; that He is the way, the truth, and the life; and that no one cometh to the Father but by Him. From this it is clear how much they turn aside from the way and the truth who pass by the Lord and approach the Father. But as I have conversed much on this subject with angels, and also with spirits, who, when they lived as men in the world, were of the Reformed Church and of the Papal religion, I shall be pleased to relate these conversations in the following pages; from which it will appear in what light the church would be respecting the Divine, which is the first and primary principle of the church, if it would acknowledge and believe in the Divine Human of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 26 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>26. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_26/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_5" target=_top>5</a>.) "Et a Jesu Christo." - Quod significet a Domino quoad Divinum Humanum, constat ex eo, quod id nomen Domini in mundo fuerit, ita nomen Humani Ipsius; quoad Divinum autem fuit nomen Ipsius "Jehovah" et "Deus." Divinum Humanum dicitur, quia Dominus Humanum suum fecit Divinum cum fuit in mundo, univit enim id suo Divino quod fuit in Ipso a conceptione, et quod fuit Ipsi anima ex Patre, ita quod fuit Ipsi vita sua: nam anima cujusvis est vita ejus; et corpus, quod est humanum, inde vivit; quapropter cum Divinum fuit unitum Humano in Domino, sicut anima corpori, Divinum Humanum dicitur. (Quod domina ecclesiae sit, quod sicut anima et corpus faciunt unum hominem, ita Divinum et Humanum fuerit unus Christus, ut et quod Divinum et Humanum Ipsius Fuerit una Persona, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_26/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_10" target=_top>10</a>.) Qui itaque cogitant de Humano Domini, et non simul de Divino Ipsius, illi prorsus non admittunt vocem Divini Humani, cogitant enim separatim de Humano et separatim de Divino, ita quasi de homine separatim ab anima seu vita ejus; quod tamen non est cogitare de homine, minus de Domino:<p>[2] et quia talis idea separata inest cogitationi eorum, ideo rogant Patrem ut misereatur propter Filium; cum tamen rogandus est Ipse Dominus ut misereatur, in quo, secundum doctrinam universalem ecclesiae, Divinum est quale est Patris; nam illa docet,<p>Quod sicut Pater, etiam Filius, est increatus, infinitus, aeternus, omnipotens, Deus, Dominus; et nemo Eorum primus et ultimus, nec maximus aut minimus; (ex Athanasii Symbolo;)<p>et quoque est secundum doctrinam ab Ipso Domino datam, quae est,<p>Quod Ipse et Pater unum sint; et quod qui Videt Ipsum videat Patrem, quia Ipse in Patre et Pater in Ipso: et quod Ipse sit via, veritas et Via; et quod nemo veniat ad Patrem, nisi per Ipsum.<p>Inde patet quantum deflectunt a via et a veritate, qui transeunt Dominum et adeunt Patrem. Sed quia plura de hac re locutus Sum cum angelis, et quoque cum spiritibus, qui fuerunt, cum vixerunt homines in mundo, ab Ecclesia Reformata, et ex Religione Pontificia, velim in sequentibus illa memorare; ex quibus apparebit in quali luce esset ecclesia de Divino, quod est primum et primarium ejus, si Divinum Humanum Domini agnosceret et crederet. </p>
