<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 475</h4><p>475. And they did wash their robes.- This signifies the removal of falsities by means of temptations, as is evident from the signification of washing, which denotes to purify from falsities and evils, consequently to remove them; for the evils and falsities which men, spirits, and angels have, are not taken away, but removed, and when removed they appear as though taken away (concerning this fact see the <a href="../njhd/166.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 166</a>, <a href="../njhd/170.htm">170</a>); washing therefore signifies to remove falsities, and thus to purify; and from the signification of robes as denoting truths in general, protecting, see above (n. <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>). But in the present case "by robes" before they were washed and made white, are signified falsities from which they were purified. For those who are in falsities from ignorance appear in the spiritual world at first in dusky garments of various colours, and while in temptations, in squalid garments; but when they come out of temptations, they appear in white robes, which shine according to their state of purification from falsities. Every one in the other life appears in garments which accord with the truths and the falsities which he has; for this reason garments signify truths, and in the opposite sense, falsities, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/271.htm">271</a>). It is evident from these things, what is signified by washing their robes and making them white.</p><p>[2] In ancient times, when all the external things of the church were representative and significative of things spiritual and celestial, washings were customary, and they represented purifications from falsities and evils. Washings had this signification, because waters signified truths, while filth signified falsities and evils, and all purification from falsities and evils takes place by means of truths. That waters signify truths may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>); and also lavers of brass were placed without the Temple, one great [laver] called "the molten sea," and ten smaller lavers (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-39</a>).</p><p>[3] Because washings signified such things, therefore when Aaron and his sons were inaugurated into the priesthood, Moses was commanded to wash them with water at the door of the tabernacle, and so to sanctify them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_29_4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_12.htm">40:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_8_6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>). For priests represented the Lord as to Divine Good, as kings represented Him as to Divine Truth; consequently the priests also represented the Divine sanctity, which is pure without blemish. Aaron and his sons received this representation through the washing by Moses; wherefore it is said, that they should thus be sanctified, although they themselves received no sanctity by the washing.</p><p>[4] Therefore it was also commanded that Aaron and his sons should wash their hands and feet before they entered the tent of the congregation, and before they ascended the altar to minister, and it is said "that they die not," and that it should be to them "a statute of an age" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>, chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_30.htm">40:30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_31.htm">31</a>); and that Aaron should wash his flesh before he put on the garments of the ministry (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_16_4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_16_24.htm">24</a>). By washing the hands and feet was signified the purification of the natural man, and by washing the flesh, the purification of the spiritual man. Hence also it was commanded, that the Levites should be sanctified by being sprinkled with the water of expiation, and by shaving their flesh, and washing their garments (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_8_6.htm">Num. 8:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_8_7.htm">7</a>). This was done to the Levites because they attended to the external things of the church under Aaron and his sons; and the purification of the external things of the church was represented by the sprinkling of the water of expiation, by shaving their flesh, and washing their garments.</p><p>[5] Moreover, all who became unclean by touching unclean things also washed themselves and their garments, and thus were said to be made clean. As for example, they who had eaten of the carcase of an unclean beast, or of what was torn (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_16.htm">16</a>); he who touched the bed of one that had a flux, or who had sat upon the vessel, upon which that one had sat, or who had touched his flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_15_5.htm">Leviticus 15:5-12</a>). The leper, after his cleansing, had to wash his garments, shave off all his hair, and wash himself with water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_14_8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_14_9.htm">9</a>); and in fact the very vessels that were made unclean by the touch of the unclean, had to be passed through waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_11_32.htm">Leviticus 11:32</a>); besides in many other references. He who supposes that they who washed their flesh, or hands and feet, or garments, were thereby cleansed and sanctified, that is to say, purified from their sins, is much deceived. For sins are not washed away or removed as filth is by water, or by means of water, but they are washed away, that is, removed, by means of truths, and a life according to them, and this alone was what was represented by washings; for waters signify truths, and truths, when there is a life according to them, purify men.</p><p>[6] That these external things contribute nothing to purification from evils and falsities, is clearly taught by the Lord in Matthew:<p>"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside of them may be clean also" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">23:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_26.htm">26</a>).<p>The Lord gave similar teaching when the Jews and Pharisees rebuked His disciples for not washing their hands before they eat, for he said, that that would not defile a man, but every evil which goeth forth from the heart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_1.htm">Matthew 15:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_7_1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_38.htm">Luke 11:38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_39.htm">39</a>). It is therefore clear that the Jews, by their washings, were never sanctified and cleansed from their spiritual defilements, which are the evils issuing from the heart, because these evils reside within, and in the world have no relation to the filth which adheres to the body. It is said, that the inside of the cup and of the platter is to be cleansed in order that the outside may be clean also; for the exterior with man cannot be cleansed before the interior, since by means of the interior the exterior is cleansed. By the cup and platter are signified the interiors and exteriors of man, which receive truth and good, for the cup is the container of wine, and the platter the container of food; and wine (vinum) signifies truth, and food signifies good, just as bread does. It is therefore evident what is signified, in the spiritual sense, by cleansing first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may be clean also.</p><p>[7] The same also is meant by the washing of the feet of the disciples, concerning which the Lord thus spoke to Peter:<p>"He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit" (<a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>). Concerning this interior truth more may be seen in the <a href="../njhd/179.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 179</a>, <a href="../njhd/181.htm">181</a>); and in the Arcana Coelestia, where the following subjects are illustrated, namely, that each man, both the internal or spiritual, and the external or natural, must be purified in order that a man may be purified, and that the external must be purified by the internal (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3868.htm">3868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3870.htm">3870</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3872.htm">3872</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3876.htm">3876</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3877.htm">3877</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3882.htm">3882</a>). The internal man is purified before the external, because the internal is in the light of heaven, and the external in the light of the world (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3469.htm">3469</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4353.htm">4353</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8746.htm">8746</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9325.htm">9325</a>). The external or natural man is purified by the Lord through the internal or spiritual (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3288.htm">3288</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3321.htm">3321</a>). A man is not purified until the external or natural man is also purified (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8742.htm">8742-8747</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9043.htm">9043</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9046.htm">9046</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9061.htm">9061</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9325.htm">9325</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9334.htm">9334</a>). Unless the natural man be purified, the spiritual man is closed (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6299.htm">6299</a>); and as to the truths and goods of faith and of love he is as it were blind (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>).<p>The internal man is purified by knowing, understanding, and thinking the truths of the Word, and the external man, by willing and doing them. From these considerations the meaning of the Lord's words to Peter is now clear, "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit;" and also the Lord's words to the Pharisees; "Cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside of them may be clean also."</p><p>[8] That the internal man is purified by means of the truths of faith, and the external by a life according to them, is meant also by these words of the Lord, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>). Water signifies the truths of faith, and the spirit, a life according to them.</p><p>[9] From these observations the signification of washing in the following passages is evident.<p>Thus in Ezekiel:<p>"I washed thee with waters; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy bloods from upon thee, and I anointed thee with oil" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_9.htm">16:9</a>).<p>This was said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church; the purification of the church from falsities and evils is signified by, I washed thee with waters; yea I thoroughly washed away thy bloods from upon thee. To wash with waters signifies to purify it by means of truths, and to wash away bloods signifies to purify from evils and falsities. To imbue it with the good of love is signified by, I anointed thee with oil, oil denoting the good of love.</p><p>[10] In Isaiah:<p>"When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the bloods of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, in the spirit of judgment, and in the spirit of cleansing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_4.htm">4:4</a>).<p>To wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion, signifies to purify the affections of those who are of the celestial church from the evils of the love of self, filth denoting the evil of the love of self, daughters, the affections, and Zion, the church which is in love to the Lord, and is therefore called the celestial church. To wash away the bloods of Jerusalem signifies to purify the affections from the falsities of evil, bloods denoting those falsities. In the spirit of judgment, and in the spirit of cleansing, signifies, by the understanding of truth, and by the affection for truth, for spirit denotes the Divine Truth which proceeds from the Lord, the spirit of judgment, the understanding of truth thence, and the spirit of cleansing, the spiritual affection for truth, since it is this which cleanses.</p><p>[11] Again, in Job:<p>"If I wash myself in waters of snow, and make my hands clean with lye; yet shalt thou plunge me into the pit, and mine own clothes shall abhor me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_9_30.htm">9:30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_9_31.htm">31</a>).<p>These words mean, that if any one desire to purify himself, even by means of truths and goods which are, or seem to be genuine, he will still lead himself into falsities. To wash himself denotes to purify himself; waters of snow denote the truths which are, or seem to be, genuine; lye denotes the good from which [such waters come]; and the pit denotes what is false. That consequently truths falsified exist, is meant by mine own clothes shall abhor me, clothes denoting truths, which are said to abhor a man when he falsifies them, and this is the case when he thinks out and forms conclusions from his own intelligence.</p><p>[12] In Moses:<p>"Who washes his garment in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6377.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6377</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6378.htm">6378</a>).</p><p>[13] That washing, signifies to purify from falsities and evils, is evident in Isaiah:<p>"Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">1:16</a>).<p>Because to wash signifies to remove falsities and evils, it is therefore said, "put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil."</p><p>[14] In Jeremiah:<p>"O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thoughts of thine iniquity lodge within thee?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">4:14</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_7.htm">7</a>).<p>Here to wash clearly denotes to purify from falsities and evils, for it is said, "wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin," and afterwards "wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." To wash from iniquity denotes purification from falsities, and from sin denotes from evils, for iniquity is spoken of falsities, and sin, of evils. Because the water of expiation also was prepared from hyssop, it is therefore said, "purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean."</p><p>[15] In Jeremiah:<p>"Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much lye, thine iniquity is marked before me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_22.htm">2:22</a>).<p>Here also it is clear that washings only represented and thence signified spiritual washings, which are purifications from falsities and evils, for it is said, "Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much lye, yet thine iniquity is marked before me."</p><p>[16] Similarly in David:<p>"I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued, and my chastisement until the mornings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_73_13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_73_14.htm">14</a>).<p>Here, to wash his hands in innocency, denotes to declare himself to be innocent and pure from evils and falsities; for the washing of the hands was also a testification of innocence; as also is evident from the fact that Pilate washed his hands and said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just one" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_27_24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>).</p><p>[17] Because washings signified purifications from falsities and evils, and because the blind signified those who do not see truths, and thence are in falsities, therefore the Lord told the blind man, whose eyes he anointed with clay made of spittle, to wash himself in the pool of Siloam; and he afterwards washed and came seeing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_6.htm">John 9:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_15.htm">15</a>). The blind man here represented those who can see nothing of truth because they are sensual, and see only those things which appear before the external senses, and therefore they drink in fallacies instead of truths, and apply the sense of the letter of the Word to confirm them. The clay made of spittle signifies sensual truth, such as is contained in the Word for such persons. The waters of the lake or pool of Siloam signify the truths of the Word for all things even to the pools of water in Jerusalem, were significative; and by washing is signified to purify from fallacies, which in themselves are falsities. Hence the signification of these things in a series is evident; for all the miracles and works of the Lord, when He was in the world, signified celestial and spiritual Divine things, that is, such things as have reference to heaven and the church, and this because they were Divine, and the Divine always operates in ultimates from primaries (ex primis), and so in fulness. Ultimates are such things as appear before the eyes in the world; for this reason the Lord spoke, and the Word was written by means of such things in nature, which are correspondences.</p><p>[18] The case is similar with the miracle wrought on Naaman the leper at the command of Elisha, recorded as follows in the second book of Kings:<p>Naaman the Syrian was afflicted with leprosy, and was bidden by a messenger from Elisha to wash himself seven times in Jordan, and his flesh should come again to him and he should be clean, and at length Naaman "went down and dipped himself in Jordan seven times, and then his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_5_10.htm">5:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_5_14.htm">14</a>).<p>Naaman, of Syria, the leper, represented and signified those who falsify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for leprosy signifies falsifications, and Syria, the knowledges of truth and good. The waters of Jordan signified truths introductory to the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for the river Jordan was the first boundary by which the land of Canaan was entered, and by the land of Canaan was signified the church; hence the waters of Jordan signified introductory truths, which are the first knowledges of truth and good from the Word. On account of this signification of the waters of Jordan, Naaman was commanded to wash himself in it seven times, which signified purification from falsified truths. Seven times signify what is in fulness, and when used of holy things, it signifies such holy things as Divine truths are. By reason of this signification of seven times, it is said that his flesh was restored as the flesh of a little child, and by the flesh being restored is signified spiritual life, such as those have who are regenerated by means of Divine truths.</p><p>[19] Because the waters of Jordan signify truths introductory to the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, and since washing therein signifies purification from falsities, and thence reformation and regeneration by the Lord, therefore baptism was instituted, and it was first administered in Jordan by John (<a href="../njhd/202.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 202-209</a>).</p><p>[20] John said that he baptized with water, but that the Lord baptized with the Holy Spirit and with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_33.htm">John 1:33</a>). By this is meant, that John only inaugurated them into knowledges from the Word concerning the Lord, and so prepared them to receive Him, but that the Lord Himself regenerates man by Divine Truth and Divine Good proceeding from Himself; for John represented the Word just as Elijah did; the water with which John baptized signified introductory truths, these being knowledges concerning the Lord from the Word. The Holy Spirit signifies Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord; fire, the Divine Good proceeding from Him; and baptism, regeneration by the Lord, by means of Divine Truths from the Word.</p><p>[21] Washings were instituted in the ancient churches, and afterwards baptisms in their place, which nevertheless were only representative and significative rites, in order that heaven might be conjoined with the human race, and specifically with the man of the church. For heaven is conjoined to man when he is in ultimates, that is, in such things as are in the world as to his natural man, and in such things as are in heaven as to his spiritual man; there cannot be conjunction in any other way. It was for this reason that baptism and the Holy Supper were instituted, and that by means of such things as are in the world the Word was written, and that it contains a spiritual sense, wherein are heavenly things; and that the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, and contains a spiritual sense within it. That by means of this the Word conjoins the angels of heaven with the men of the church, may be seen in the work concerning <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_26.htm">23:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_27.htm">27</a>), by means of the things explained above in this article. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 475</h4><p>475. And have washed their robes, signifies the removal of falsities by means of temptations. This is evident from the signification of "to wash," as being to purify from falsities and evils, consequently to remove them; for the evils and falsities that are with man, spirit, and angel, are not taken away, but are removed, and when they have been removed the appearance is that they have been taken away (respecting this see in <a href="../njhd/166.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 166</a>, <a href="../njhd/170.htm">170</a>) thence "to wash" signifies to remove falsities, and thus to purify. Also from the signification of "robes," as being protecting truths in general (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>; but "robes" here, before they have been washed and made white, signify falsities from which they have [not yet] been purified; for those who are in falsities from ignorance appear in the spiritual world at first in dusky garments of diverse colors, and while they are in temptations in filthy garments; but when they come out of temptations they appear in white robes, glistening according to their purification from falsities. Each one in the other life appears in garments according to the truths and according to the falsities that are with him; <sup>1</sup>this is why "garments" signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities (See above, n. <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/271.htm">271</a>). From this the signification of "they have washed their robes and have made them white" can be seen.</p><p>[2] In ancient times, when all the externals of the church were representative and significative of things spiritual and celestial, washings were made use of, and they represented purifications from falsities and evils; "washings" had this signification because "waters" signified truths, and "filth" falsities and evils, and all purification from falsities and evils is effected by truths (that "waters" signify truths see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>);<p>Also lavers of brass were placed outside of the temple, one great laver which was called the sea of brass, and ten smaller ones (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-39</a>).</p><p>[3] Because of this signification of "washings," when Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priesthood:<p>Moses was commanded to wash them with water at the entrance of the tent, and thus to sanctify them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_29_4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_12.htm">40:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_8_6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>);<p>for the priests represented the Lord in relation to Divine good, as kings represented Him in relation to Divine truth, consequently the priests represented also the Divine holiness which is pure without blemish. Aaron and his sons were inducted into this representation by the washing by Moses; therefore it is said that "thus they should be sanctified," although no sanctity was conferred upon them by the washing.</p><p>[4] It was therefore also commanded that:<p>Aaron and his sons should wash their hands and feet before entering into the tent of meeting, and before they came near to the altar to minister; and it is said that they were to do this that they die not; and that it should be to them a statute of an age (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_30.htm">40:30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_31.htm">31</a>).<p>Also that Aaron should wash his flesh before he put on the garments of ministry (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_16_4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_16_24.htm">24</a>).<p>"Washing the hands and feet" signified the purification of the natural man, and "washing the flesh" the purification of the spiritual man. It was therefore commanded also:<p>That the Levites should be sanctified by being sprinkled with the water of expiation, and by causing a razor to pass over their flesh, and that they should wash their garments (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_8_6.htm">Numbers 8:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_8_7.htm">7</a>).<p>This was done to the Levites because they ministered in the external things of the church under Aaron and his sons, and the purification of the external things of the church was represented by the sprinkling of the water of expiation, by shaving the hairs of the flesh, and by washing the garments.</p><p>[5] Furthermore, all who were made unclean by touching unclean things also washed themselves and their garments, and were said to be made clean thereby, as:<p>Those who ate of the dead body of a clean beast, or of what was torn (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_16.htm">16</a>).<p>One who touched the bed of one who had an issue, or sat upon the vessel that he sat on, or who touched his flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_15_4.htm">Leviticus 15:4-12</a>).<p>It was also commanded that the leper, after his cleansing, should wash his garments, shave off his hair, and wash himself with water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_14_8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_14_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Also that such vessels as had become unclean by the touch of the unclean, should be passed through water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_11_32.htm">Leviticus 11:32</a>; besides other statutes).<p>He is much mistaken who supposes that those who washed their flesh or hands and feet, or garments, were cleansed and sanctified, that is, purified from their sins; for sins are not washed away or taken away by water as filth is, but they are washed away, that is, removed, by means of truths and a life according to them, and this alone was what was represented by the washings; for "waters" signify truths, and truths when there is life according to them, purify the man.</p><p>[6] That these external things contribute nothing to purification from evils and falsities, is clearly taught by the Lord in Matthew:<p>Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter that the outside of them may become clean also (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_26.htm">26</a>).<p>Like things were taught by the Lord when the Jews and Pharisees rebuked His disciples for not washing their hands before eating, for He taught:<p>That by this a man is not rendered unclean, but by every evil that goeth forth from the heart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_1.htm">Matthew 15:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_19.htm">19-20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_7_1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_38.htm">Luke 11:38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_39.htm">39</a>).<p>From this it can be seen that the Jews by their washings were never sanctified and cleansed from their spiritual defilements, which are the evils going forth from the heart, since these evils reside within; and in the world they have nothing in common with the filth that adheres to the body. It is said that "the inside of the cup and platter must be cleansed that the outside may become clean also;" for the outside with man cannot be cleansed until the inside is cleansed, for the outside is cleansed by means of the inside. "The cup and platter" signify the interiors and exteriors of man, which receive truth and good, for the cup is what contains wine, and the platter is what contains food, and "wine" signifies truth, and "food" has a similar signification as "bread," namely, good. This makes clear the signification in the spiritual sense of "cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may become clean also."</p><p>[7] What the Lord says here has a similar meaning as His washing the feet of the disciples, respecting which He thus said to Peter, in John:<p>He that hath bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is wholly clean (<a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>). More may be seen respecting this arcanum in <a href="../njhd/179.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 179</a>, <a href="../njhd/181.htm">181</a>; and in Arcana Coelestia, where the following are made clear: For a man to be purified, both the internal or spiritual and the external or natural must be purified, and the external by means of the internal, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3868.htm">3868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3870.htm">3870</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3872.htm">3872</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3876.htm">3876</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3877.htm">3877</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3882.htm">3882</a>. The internal man is purified before the external, because the internal is in the light of heaven, and the external in the light of the world, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3469.htm">3469</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4353.htm">4353</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8746.htm">8746</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9325.htm">9325</a>. The external or natural man is purified by the Lord through the internal or spiritual, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3288.htm">3288</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3321.htm">3321</a>. A man is not purified until the external or natural man is also purified, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8742.htm">8742-8747</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9043.htm">9043</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9046.htm">9046</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9061.htm">9061</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9325.htm">9325</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9334.htm">9334</a>. If the natural man is not purified the spiritual man is closed up, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6299.htm">6299</a>; and in respect to the truths and goods of faith and love, it is as it were blind, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>). The internal man is purified by knowing, understanding, and thinking the truths of the Word, and the external man by willing and doing them. This makes clear how the Lord's words to Peter must be understood, "He that hath bathed needeth not save to wash his feet;" likewise how the Lord's words to the Pharisees must be understood, "cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may become clean also."</p><p>[8] That the internal man is purified by truths which are of faith, and the external by a life according to them, is meant also by these words of the Lord:<p>Except one be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>).<p>"Water" signifying the truths of faith, and "spirit" a life according to them.</p><p>[9] From this it can now be seen what "washing" signifies in the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>I washed thee with waters; yea, I rinsed away thy bloods from upon thee, and I anointed thee with oil (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>).<p>This was said of Jerusalem, by which the church is signified; its purification from falsities and from evils is signified by "I washed thee with waters; yea, I rinsed away thy bloods from upon thee," "to wash with waters" signifying to purify the church by truths, and "to rinse away the bloods" signifying purification from falsities and evils. To imbue the church with the good of love is signified by "I anointed thee with oil," "oil" meaning the good of love.</p><p>[10] In Isaiah:<p>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have washed away the bloods of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, in the spirit of judgment, and in the spirit of cleansing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>).<p>"To wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion" signifies to purify the affections of those who are of a celestial church from the evils of love of self, "filth" meaning the evil of the love of self," "daughters" the affection, and "Zion" the church that is in love to the Lord, which is therefore called a celestial church; "to wash away the bloods of Jerusalem" signifies to purify the same affections from the falsities of evil, "bloods" meaning the falsities of evil; "in the spirit of judgment and in the spirit of cleansing" signifies by means of the understanding of truth and the affection of truth, "spirit" meaning the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, "the spirit of judgment" the understanding of truth therefrom, and "the spirit of cleansing" the spiritual affection of truth, for that is what cleanses.</p><p>[11] In Job:<p>If I shall wash myself in waters of snow, and cleanse my hands with soap, yet wilt thou plunge me into the pit, and mine own garments shall abhor me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_9_30.htm">Job 9:30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_9_31.htm">31</a>).<p>This means that if one attempts to purify himself by his own efforts, although by means of truths and goods that are or that appear to be genuine, he will yet lead himself into falsities; "to wash oneself" means to purify oneself; "waters of snow" mean truths that are or that appear to be genuine; "soap" means the good from which they come, and "the pit" falsity. That from this come truths falsified is meant by "mine own garments shall abhor me;" "garments" meaning truths, which are said "to abhor one" when they are falsified, and this is done when man from self-intelligence speculates and draws conclusions.</p><p>[12] In Moses:<p>He washed his vesture in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6377.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6377</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6378.htm">6378</a>.)</p><p>[13] That "to wash" signifies to purify from falsities and evils is clearly evident in Isaiah:<p>Wash you, make you pure; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>).<p>Because "to wash" signifies to put away falsities and evils, it is added, "put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil."</p><p>[14] In Jeremiah:<p>Wash thine heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall the thoughts of thine iniquity lodge in the midst of thee? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a>).<p>This has a similar signification. In David:<p>Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_2.htm">Psalms 51:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_7.htm">7</a>).<p>Here "to wash" plainly means to purify from falsities and evils, for it is said, "Wash me from iniquity, and cleanse me from sin," and afterwards, "Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow;" "to wash from iniquity" means from falsities, and "from sin" means from evils, for "iniquity" is predicated of falsities, and "sin" of evils; and because the water of expiation was prepared from hyssop, it is said, "Thou shalt purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. "</p><p>[15] In Jeremiah:<p>Although thou shalt wash thee with niter and take thee <sup>2</sup>much soap, thine iniquity shall still retain its spots before Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_22.htm">Jeremiah 2:22</a>).<p>Here, too, it is clear that washings only represented and thence signified spiritual washings, which are purifications from falsities and evils, for it is said, "Although thou shalt wash thee with niter, and take thee much soap, thine iniquity shall still retain its spots."</p><p>[16] Thus also in David:<p>In vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence. All the day have I been plagued, and in the mornings was my reproof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_73_13.htm">Psalms 73:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_73_14.htm">14</a>).<p>"To wash the hands in innocence" means to bear witness that one is innocent and pure from evils and falsities; for washing the hands was a testification of innocence; as can be seen also from the fact that:<p>Pilate washed his hands and said, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_27_24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>).</p><p>[17] Because "washings" signified purifications from falsities and evils, and "one blind" signified those who do not see truths, and are therefore in falsities:<p>The Lord told the blind man whose eyes He anointed with clay made with spittle, to wash himself in the pool of Siloam, and when he had washed himself he came seeing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_6.htm">John 9:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_15.htm">15</a>).<p>The "blind man" here represented those who can see nothing of truth because they are sensual, and see only those things that appear before the external senses, from which come fallacies instead of truths, and to the confirmation of these they apply the sense of the letter of the Word; "the clay made of spittle" signifies sensual truth, such as the Word contains for such persons; "the waters of the lake or pool of Siloam" signify the truths of the Word, for all things, even to the waters in Jerusalem were significative; and "to wash" signifies to purify from fallacies, which in themselves are falsities. From this it can be seen what these things signify in series; for all the miracles and works of the Lord when He was in the world signified Divine celestial and Divine spiritual things, that is, such things as pertain to heaven and the church, and this because they were Divine, and the Divine always operates in ultimates from first things, and thus in fullness; ultimates are such as appear before the eyes in the world. This is why the Lord spoke and the Word was written by means of such things in nature as correspond.</p><p>[18] It is similar with the miracle performed on Naaman the leper by command of Elisha, which is thus described in the second book of Kings:<p>Naaman of Syria, being affected with leprosy, was commanded by a messenger from Elisha to wash himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh would come again and he would be clean. At length Naaman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little lad, and he was clean (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_5_10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_5_14.htm">14</a>).<p>"Naaman a leper of Syria" represented and signified those who falsify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for "leprosy" signifies falsifications, and "Syria" the knowledges of truth and good. "The waters of Jordan" signified the truths that introduce into the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for the river Jordan was the first boundary across which the land of Canaan was entered, and "the land of Canaan" signified the church; this is why "the waters of Jordan" signified introductory truths, which are the first knowledges of truth and good from the Word. Because of this signification of "the waters of Jordan," Naaman was commanded to wash himself in them seven times, which signified purification from falsified truths; "seven times" signifies fully, and is predicated of things holy, such as truths Divine are. Because "seven times" has this signification, it is said that "his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little lad," the flesh coming again signifying spiritual life, such as those have who are regenerated through Divine truths.</p><p> [19] Because "the waters of Jordan" signified the truths that introduce into the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, and "washing" therein signified purification from falsities, and consequent reformation and regeneration by the Lord, therefore baptism was instituted, which was first performed in Jordan by John (<a href="../njhd/202.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 202-209</a>.)</p><p>[20] It was said by John:<p>That he baptized with water; but that the Lord would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_33.htm">John 1:33</a>).<p>This means that John only inaugurated them into knowledges from the Word respecting the Lord, and thus prepared them to receive Him, but that the Lord Himself regenerates man by means of Divine truth and Divine good proceeding from Him; for John represented the like as Elijah, namely, the Word; "the waters" with which John baptized signified introductory truths, which are knowledges from the Word respecting the Lord; "the Holy Spirit" signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and "fire" signifies Divine good proceeding from Him; and "baptism" signifies regeneration by the Lord by means of Divine truths from the Word.</p><p>[21] Washings were instituted in the ancient churches, and afterwards baptisms in their place, which nevertheless are only representative and significative rites, in order that heaven might be conjoined with the human race, and in particular with the man of the church; for heaven is conjoined to man when man is in ultimates, that is, in such things as are in the world in regard to his natural man, while he is in such things as are in heaven in regard to his spiritual man; in no other way is conjunction possible. This is why baptism was instituted; also the holy supper; likewise why the Word was written by means of such things as are in the world, while there is in it a spiritual sense, containing such things as are in heaven, that is, that the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, while in it there is a spiritual sense. (That by means of this sense the Word conjoins the angels of heaven with the men of the church, may be seen in the work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_26.htm">Matthew 23:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_27.htm">27</a>), as explained above in this article.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "them."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "he take thee." </p>

(Quod Verbum per id conjungat angelos caeli cum hominibus ecclesiae, videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_475/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_303" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 303-310</a>, et in opusculo De Equo Albo a principio ad finem; tum quod Sancta Cena conjungat, [in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae,] n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_475/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_210" target=_top>210-222</a>; ita quoque Baptismus.) At qui credit quod Baptismus aliquid ad salvationem hominis conferat, nisi is simul sit in veris ecclesiae et in vita secundum illa; multum fallitur; nam baptizatio est externum, quod absque interno nihil facit ad salvationem, sed facit ubi externum conjunctum est interno.
