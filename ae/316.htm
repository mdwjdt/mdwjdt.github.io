<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 316</h4><p>316. Having seven horns. That this signifies to whom belongs Omnipotence, is evident from the signification of a horn, as denoting the power of truth against falsity, but when predicated of the Lord, as denoting all power or omnipotence. The reason why the Lamb was seen to have horns seven in number, was because by seven is signified all, and it is said of what is holy (see above, n. <a href="../ae/257.htm">257</a>). Horn and horns signify power, because the power of horned animals, as of oxen, rams, goats, and others, lies in their horns. That horn or horns signify the power of truth against falsity, and, in the highest sense, where said of the Lord, Omnipotence, and, in the opposite sense, the power of falsity against truth, is evident from many passages in the Word; and because it is thence evident what horns in the Word signify, of which mention is so often made in Daniel, and also in the Apocalypse, and because they are still in use in the coronation of kings, I wish to quote them.</p><p>[2] In Ezekiel:<p>"In that day will I make the horn of the house of Israel to grow, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; that they may know that I am Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_21.htm">29:21</a>).<p>To make the horn of the house of Israel to grow, signifies truth in abundance, the house of Israel denoting the church; because this is signified by horn and its increase, therefore it is also said, "And I will give thee the opening of the mouth," by which is meant the preaching of the truth.</p><p>[3] In the first book of Samuel:<p>"The horn hath exalted her in Jehovah; my mouth is enlarged against mine enemies, because I rejoice in thy salvation. He shall give strength unto his king, and shall exalt the horn of his anointed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3008.htm">3008</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9954.htm">9954</a>).</p><p>[4] In David:<p>Jehovah "hath exalted the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, of the sons of Israel, a people near unto him" (<a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>). Israel denotes the church which is in truths, the sons thereof denote truths; people is also said of those who are in truths, and they are said to be near who are thereby conjoined with the Lord.</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>"Jehovah God of hosts, thou art the grace of their strength; and by thy good pleasure thou shalt exalt our horn" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_8.htm">89:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_17.htm">17</a>).<p>By to exalt the horn is also here signified to fill with Divine truth, and thereby to give power against falsities; on which account it is said, "Jehovah God of hosts, thou art the grace of their strength"; grace also in the Word is predicated of the church, and of the doctrine of truth therein.</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>"A good man sheweth mercy and lendeth. His Justice endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with glory" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_112_5.htm">Psalms 112:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_112_9.htm">9</a>).<p>That horn signifies Divine truth, is evident from this consideration, that it is said, his justice endureth for ever, and his horn shall be exalted with glory; justice in the Word is said of good, therefore the horn is said of truth; for in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth; glory also signifies Divine truth.</p><p>[7] In Habakkuk:<p>"The brightness" of Jehovah God "shall be as the light; he hath horns coming out of his hand; and there is the hiding of his strength" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_4.htm">3:4</a>).<p>Because horns signify Divine truth with power, therefore it is said, "The brightness of Jehovah God shall be as the light," and in the horns is the hiding of His strength. By the brightness of Jehovah and the light, is signified Divine truth; and by the hiding of His strength in the horns, is signified the omnipotence of the Divine good by the Divine truth, for all the power of good is by means of truth; and in Divine truth lies concealed the Omnipotence which is of Divine good.</p><p>[8] In David:<p>"I have found David my servant; with the oil of holiness have I anointed him: with whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him. My truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted" (<a href="../ae/203.htm">203</a>); and by his horn shall be exalted, is meant His Divine power, which He has from Divine good by means of Divine truth; therefore it is said, "My truth and my mercy shall be with him"; mercy in the Word, when said of Jehovah or the Lord, signifies the Divine good of the Divine love. Because by David is meant the Lord as to Divine truth proceeding from His Divine Human, He is therefore called David My servant; by servant in the Word is not meant a servant in the general sense, but whatever serves, and it is said of truth, because it serves good for use, here for power.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>"I will make the horn of David to bud; I will place a lamp for mine anointed" (<a href="../ae/62.htm">62</a>.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>"Jehovah is my strength, my rock, my fortress; God [is] my rock in which I confide, my shield, and the horn of my salvation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_1.htm">Psalms 18:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_2.htm">2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_3.htm">2 Sam. 22:3</a>).<p>Strength and rock, when said of Jehovah or the Lord, as in this passage, signify omnipotence; the fortress and rock in which he trusts, signify defence; the shield and horn of salvation signify salvation thence; strength, fortress, and shield in the Word are said of Divine good; stone, rock, and horn are said of Divine truth; hence by those things are signified omnipotence, defence, and salvation, which are from the Divine good by the Divine truth.</p><p>[11] In Luke:<p>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised up a horn of salvation in the house of David; that he might save us from our enemies" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_68.htm">1:68</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_69.htm">69</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_71.htm">71</a>).<p>This is a prophetical [saying] of Zacharias concerning the Lord and His advent. The horn of salvation, in the house of David, signifies omnipotence of saving by means of Divine truth from Divine good; the horn denotes that omnipotence; the house of David denotes the Lord's church. The enemies from which He should save us, are the falsities of evil, for these are the enemies from which the Lord saves those who receive Him; that there were no other enemies from which the Lord preserved those who are there meant by His people, is known.</p><p>[12] In Micah:<p>"Rise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass, that thou mayest break in pieces many peoples" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_4_13.htm">4:13</a>).<p>Rise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, signifies the dissipation of evil with those who belong to the church; to thresh, denotes to dissipate; and the daughter of Zion denotes the church which is in the affection of good. I will make thy horn iron, signifies Divine truth mighty and powerful; and thy hoofs brass, has a similar signification, hoofs denoting truths in ultimates. That thou mayest break in pieces many peoples, signifies that thou mayest disperse falsities; for "peoples" is said of truths, and, in an opposite sense, of falsities.</p><p>[13] In Zechariah:<p>"I saw, and behold the four horns which dispersed Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem; he shewed me four smiths, and he said, These horns which have scattered Judah, so that not a man lifteth up his head, these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lift up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">1:18-21</a>).<p>By these things the vastation of the church is described, and afterwards its restoration. By Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem, are signified the church and its doctrine; the horns which scattered them, signify the falsities of evil, which have vastated the church; smiths signify the same as iron, namely, truth in ultimates, which is mighty and powerful, consequently the same as the horn of iron; therefore it is said concerning them, "These have come to cast down the horns of the nations which lift up the horn against the land of Judah." The horns of the nations denote the falsities of evil which have vastated the church, and which are to be dispersed in order that it may be restored.</p><p>[14] In Lamentations:<p>"The Lord hath destroyed in his wrath the fortifications of the daughter of Judah; he hath cast them down to the earth; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof; he hath cut off in the wrath of [his] anger all the horn of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_2.htm">2:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_3.htm">3</a>).<p>The total vastation of the church is here treated of. The last time, when it is devastated, is signified by the wrath of the Lord's anger; and its total vastation is described by, "He hath destroyed the fortifications of the daughter of Judah, he hath cast them down to the ground, he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof." The daughter of Judah denotes the church; her fortifications denote truths from good; the kingdom and the princes denote the truths of its doctrine; hence it is evident what is signified by, "He hath cut off all the horn of Israel," namely, all the power of the truth of the church to resist the falsities of evil.</p><p>[15] In Daniel:<p>Daniel saw in a vision four beasts ascending out of the sea; the fourth exceedingly strong, having teeth of iron. He devoured and brake in pieces; and he had ten horns; and I gave heed, and behold, another little horn came up among them, and three of the former horns were uprooted before it; in this horn there were eyes as the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. I saw that this horn made war with the saints, and had prevailed against them, and that it spake words against the Most High; as to the ten horns, they are ten kings, and it shall humble three kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">7:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_24.htm">24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_25.htm">25</a>).<p>That by horns are here meant falsities which destroy the truths of the church, or the power of falsities against truths, is evident. By the beast ascending out of the sea, is signified the love of self, from which all evils [originate], in this case the love of ruling over heaven and earth, to which things holy are made subservient as means; of this quality is the love that is meant by Babylon in the Apocalypse. The beast was seen to ascend out of the sea, because by the sea is signified the natural man separated from the spiritual; for he is then such as to desire nothing more than to rule over all, and to confirm his rule from the sense of the letter of the Word. The ten horns signify falsities of every kind, for ten denotes all; therefore it is also said, that the ten horns are ten kings, for kings signify truths, and, in an opposite sense, as here, falsities. The little horn which came up among them, before which three of the former horns were uprooted, signifies the full perversion of the Word by the application of the sense of its letter to confirm the love of dominion. This horn is called little, because it does not appear that the Word is perverted; and that which does not appear before the sight of a man's spirit, or before his understanding, is considered either as nothing, or as little; in the spiritual world there is such an appearance of things to be apprehended only by a few. The three horns which were uprooted before it, signify the truths of the Word there, which are thus destroyed by falsifications; those truths are also signified by the three kings who were humbled by it. By three are not signified three, but is full, thus that truths were completely destroyed. Because that horn signifies the perversion of the Word as to the sense of its letter, and this sense appears before the eyes of men as if it were to be thus and not otherwise understood, consequently to be contradicted by no one, it is therefore said of this horn, that in it there were eyes as the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things. The eyes signify the understanding; and eyes as the eyes of a man, the understanding, as it were, of the truth and the mouth signifies thought and speech thence.<p>From these considerations it may now be seen what is meant by all and each of the things here mentioned; as what by the beast ascending out of the sea, which had ten horns, and teeth of iron, and devoured and brake in pieces; what by the little horn which came up among them, before which three of the horns were uprooted, in which were eyes as the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things; also what by it made war with the saints and prevailed against them, and that it spake words against the Most High; and that the horns were so many kings.</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>"I saw in a vision a ram which had two horns, and the horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. It shall push towards the west, the north, and the south. Then, behold, a he-goat of the she-goats came from the west upon the faces of the whole earth; it had a horn visible between its eyes. He ran unto the ram in the fury of his strength, and he brake his two horns, and he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him. But the great horn of the he-goat was broken; and there came up four in place thereof toward the four winds of the heavens. Presently out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward glory. And it grew, even to the host of the heavens; and it cast down of the host to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, even to the prince of the host it exalted itself; and the dwelling of his sanctuary was cast down, because it cast down truth to the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_25.htm">25</a>).<p>Here is described another thing which vastates the church, namely, faith alone. By the ram is signified the good of charity and faith thence, and by the he-goat faith separate from charity, or faith alone; or, what is the same, those who are therein; by their horns are signified truths from good and falsities from evil, combating; truths from good by the horns of the ram, and falsities from evil by the horns of the he-goat. By the ram having two high horns, one higher than the other, and the higher coming up last, is signified the truth of faith from the good of charity; and this is seen according to the influx of good and truth with men and spirits, for all good is received behind, and all truth in front, because the cerebellum is formed to receive the good of the will, and the cerebrum to receive the truth of the understanding. By the west, the north, and the south, towards which the ram pushed, are signified the goods and truths which those receive who are in charity and the faith thence, and by which they disperse evils and falsities.<p>By the he-goat of the she-goats which came upon the faces of the whole earth, is signified faith separate from charity, arising from evil of life; the he-goat of the she-goats denotes that faith; the west denotes evil of life; and the earth denotes the church; it had a horn visible between the eyes, signifies that it was of self-intelligence; that he ran unto the ram in the fury of his strength, and brake his two horns, and threw him down to the ground, and stamped upon him, signify the complete destruction of charity and the faith thence; for when charity is destroyed faith also is destroyed, for the latter is from the former. The great horn of the he-goat being broken, and four coming up in place thereof, towards the four winds of the heavens, signify all falsities conjoined with the evils thence; the horns signify the falsities of evil, four their conjunction, and the four winds of the heavens all, as well falsities as evils. That out of one of them came forth a little horn, signifies justification thereby, for this is born from the principle of faith alone; it is said to be little, because it does not appear as a falsity.<p>That this horn grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards glory; and grew even to the host of the heavens, and cast down of the host to the ground, and stamped upon them, signifies that it destroyed all the truths and goods of the church. The south denotes where truth is in the light; the east and glory denote where good is in clearness by truth; the host of the heavens denote all the truths and goods of heaven and the church; to cast down the host to the ground, and to stamp upon them, signifies to entirely destroy; that it exalteth itself, even to the prince of the host, and that the dwelling of his sanctuary was cast down, signifies the denial of the Lord's Divine Human, and the consequent vastation of the church. The prince of the host denotes the Lord as to the Divine Human, because from that proceed all the truths and goods which constitute the church; the dwelling of the sanctuary denotes the church where those things are; that they are truths destroyed by falsities that are meant, is evident, for it is said, it cast down the truth to the ground.<p>That such things are signified by the ram and the he-goat, and by their horns, is plainly evident from appearances in the spiritual world; for, when those who have confirmed themselves in the doctrine of faith alone, and of justification thereby, dispute there with those who are in the doctrine of charity and the faith thence, then to others who stand afar off he-goats, or a he-goat appear with similar horns, and with like insult and fury against rams or a ram, and he also appears to tread the stars under his feet. These things have been also seen by me, and at the same time by those who stood by me, who were thence convinced that such things are meant in Daniel; and also that similar things are meant by the sheep on the right hand, and the goats oil the left (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a> to the end); namely, by the sheep those who are in the good of charity, and by the he-goats those who are in faith alone.<p>From these passages, adduced from Daniel, it may in some measure appear what is signified in the Revelation:<p>By a dragon being seen having ten horns (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">12:3</a>).<p>By a beast being seen ascending out of the sea, which also had ten horns (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13:1</a>).<p>And by the woman that was seen sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, which had seven heads and ten horns; concerning which the angel said, the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12</a>).<p>But on these subjects see the explanation in the following pages.</p><p>[17] That the power of falsity against truth is signified by a horn or horns, is also clear from the following passages: In Jeremiah:<p>"The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_25.htm">48:25</a>).<p>By Moab those are signified who are in spurious goods, and in falsified truths thence, which in themselves are falsities. The destruction of these falsities is signified by the horn of Moab being cut off, and the destruction of those evils by his arm being broken.</p><p>[18] In Lamentations:<p>"Jehovah hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_17.htm">2:17</a>).<p>By enemy is meant evil, and by adversaries the falsities of evil; to exalt the horn of the adversaries, is for falsities to prevail over truths and destroy them.</p><p>[19] In Ezekiel:<p>"Ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the infirm sheep with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_21.htm">34:21</a>).<p>To thrust with side and shoulder, is with all strength and effort; to push with [your] horns the infirm sheep till ye have scattered them abroad, signifies by falsities to destroy the well disposed, who are not yet in truths from good, but still desire to be.</p><p>[20] In Amos:<p>"In the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will visit upon the altars of Bethel, that the horns of the altar may be cut off, and fall to the ground" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_3_14.htm">3:14</a>).<p>By the altars of Bethel worship from evil is signified, and by the horns of the altar are signified the falsities of that evil; and that these are to be destroyed, is signified by the horns being cut off, and falling to the ground.</p><p>[21] In the same:<p>"Those who rejoice over a thing of nought; who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_6_13.htm">6:13</a>).<p>To take horns by our own strength, signifies by the power of one's own intelligence to acquire the falsities by which truths are destroyed.</p><p>[22] In David:<p>"I said unto the proud, Boast not; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn. Lift not up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; the horns of the Just shall be exalted" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_4.htm">Psalms 75:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_10.htm">10</a>).<p>By lifting up the horn on high, is signified to defend falsity strongly against the truth; therefore it is also said, "Speak not with a stiff neck." By cutting off their horns, is signified to destroy their falsities; and by exalting the horns of the just, is signified to make powerful and strong the truths of good.</p><p>[23] Because by lifting on high and by exalting the horns is signified to fill with truths, and to render them powerful and strong against falsities, therefore those truths are also called the horns of the unicorn, because these are elevated. As in Moses:<p>"The first-born of his ox he hath honour, and his horns are the horns of the unicorn; with them he shall push the peoples together to the ends of the earth; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6417.htm">6417</a>). The first-born of the ox having honour, signifies the good of spiritual love; his horns being the horns of the unicorn, signify truths in their fulness, and in their power thence; to push the peoples to the ends of the earth, signifies to instruct in truths all those who belong to the church, and thereby to dissipate falsities. The ten thousands of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh, signify the store and abundance of truth and thence of wisdom, and the store and abundance of good and thence of love. That Ephraim, in the Word, signifies the Intellectual of the church, which pertains to truth, and that Manasseh signifies the Voluntary of the church, which pertains to good, may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6267.htm">6267</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6296.htm">6296</a>; and that by ten thousands and thousands are signified very many, consequently, store and abundance.</p><p>[24] In David:<p>"Save me from the mouth of the lion; and hear me from the horns of the unicorns" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_22_21.htm">Psalms 22:21</a>).<p>By the lion is signified falsity vehemently destroying truth; and by the horns of the unicorns are signified the truths that prevail against falsities.</p><p>[25] In the same:<p>"My horn is like the horn of a unicorn" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_92_10.htm">Psalms 92:10</a>).<p>Like the horn of a unicorn, signifies truth as to fulness and power.</p><p>[26] In the Apocalypse:<p>"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is in the sight of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_13.htm">9:13</a>).<p>The altar of incense, which was called also the golden altar, was representative of the bearing and reception of all things of worship, that are from love and charity from the Lord, thus the representative of such things of worship as are elevated by the Lord. The horns of the altar represented truths proceeding from the good of love; hence it is evident why the voice was heard from the four horns of the altars, for truths are the means by which good acts and speaks.</p><p>[27] Because altars represented the worship of the Lord from the good of love, and since all worship, that is truly worship, is performed from the good of love by means of truths, therefore there were horns to the altars. That there were horns to the altar of incense, is evident in Moses:<p>"Thou shalt make four horns to the altar of incense; they shall be from it. And thou shalt overlay them with gold" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_2.htm">Exodus 30:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_10.htm">10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_37_25.htm">37:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_37_26.htm">26</a>).<p>And that there were horns to the altar of burnt-offering it is said elsewhere in the same:<p>"Thou shalt make the horns upon the four corners of the altar of burnt-offering; from it his horns shall be" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_38_2.htm">38:2</a>).<p>That the horns were from the altar itself, signified that the truths, which the horns represented, proceed from the good of love, which the altar itself represented; for all truth is from good. That there were four, and [one] at each corner, signified that they were for the four quarters in heaven, by which are signified all things of truth from good.</p><p>[28] Because all expiations, and purifications are effected by truth from good, therefore expiation was made upon the horns of the altars,<p>Upon the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>).<p>And upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_25.htm">Leviticus 4:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_9_9.htm">9:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_16_18.htm">16:18</a>).<p>And because all Divine protection is by means of truths from good, therefore also<p>Those who committed evils and feared death caught hold of the horns of the altar and were preserved (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_53.htm">53</a>);<p>But those who from premeditation, and wilfully, committed evil, were not preserved (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_2_28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-31</a>).<p>Further, because horns signified truths from good, therefore also, when kings were anointed, this was done by oil from a horn. That David was thus anointed, may be seen (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_16_1.htm">1 Sam. 16:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_16_13.htm">13</a>); and that "Solomon was so" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>); the oil signified the good of love. From this signification of horns, which the ancients knew, it was customary to make the horn, budding forth and fragrant; whence the expression, cornucopia. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 316</h4><p>316. Having seven horns, signifies who has omnipotence. This is evident from the signification of a "horn," as being the power of truth against falsity, but in reference to the Lord, as being all power or omnipotence. The Lamb was seen to have horns seven in number, because "seven" signifies all and it is predicated of what is holy (See above, n. <a href="../ae/257.htm">257</a>). A "horn" and "horns" signify power, because the power of horned animals, as of oxen, rams, goats, and others, is in their horns. That "horn" or "horns" signify the power of truth against falsity, and in the highest sense, which treats of the Lord, signify omnipotence, and in a contrary sense the power of falsity against truth, is evident from many passages in the Word; and as it is thus made clear what is signified in the Word by "horns," so often mentioned in Daniel, and also in Revelation; and as they are still employed in the coronation of kings, I will quote the passages here.</p><p>[2] In Ezekiel:<p>In that day I will make a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; that they may know that I am Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>).<p>"To make a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel" signifies truth in abundance; "the house of Israel" is the church; because this is signified by "horn," and "its budding forth," it is also said, "and I will give thee the opening of the mouth," which means the preaching of truth.</p><p>[3] In the first book of Samuel:<p>My horn hath exalted itself in Jehovah; my mouth is enlarged against mine enemies, because I am glad in Thy salvation. He shall give strength unto His king, <sup>1</sup>and shall exalt the horn of His anointed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3008.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3008-3009</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9954.htm">9954</a>).</p><p>[4] In David:<p>Jehovah hath exalted the horn of His people, the praise for all His saints, for the sons of Israel, a people near unto Him (<a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>). "Israel" is the church that is in truths, "sons of Israel" are truths, "a people" is also predicated of those who are in truths, and a people conjoined with the Lord by truths is said to be "near."</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>Jehovah God of Hosts, Thou art the splendor of their strength; and by Thy good pleasure Thou shalt exalt our horn (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_8.htm">Psalms 89:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_17.htm">17</a>).<p>Here also "to exalt the horn" signifies to fill with Divine truth, and thereby to give power against falsities; therefore it is said, "Jehovah God of Hosts, Thou art the splendor of their strength," "splendor" in the Word is predicated also of the church, and of the doctrine of truth therein.</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>The good man is gracious and lendeth. His righteousness standeth forever; his horn shall be exalted with glory (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_112_5.htm">Psalms 112:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_112_9.htm">9</a>).<p>That "horn" signifies Divine truth is clear from this, that it is said, "his righteousness standeth forever, and his horn shall be exalted with glory;" "righteousness" in the Word is predicated of good, and "horn" therefore of truth; for in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth; "splendor" also signifies Divine truth.</p><p>[7] In Habakkuk:<p>The brightness of Jehovah God shall be as the light; He hath horns coming out of His hand; and in them is the hiding of His strength (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>).<p>Because "horns" signify Divine truth with power, it is said, "the brightness of Jehovah God shall be as the light," and "in the horns is the hiding of His strength;" "the brightness of Jehovah" and "light" signify Divine truth; and "the hiding of His strength in the horns" signifies the omnipotence of Divine good through Divine truth, for all power of good is through truth, and in Divine truth lies concealed the omnipotence that is of Divine good.</p><p>[8] In David:<p>I have found David My servant; with the oil of holiness have I anointed Him; with whom My hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall make him mighty. My truth and My mercy shall be with him; and in My name shall his horn be exalted (<a href="../ae/205.htm">205</a>); and "his horn shall be exalted" means His Divine power, which He has from Divine good through Divine truth; therefore, it is said, "My truth and My mercy shall be with him;" "mercy" in the Word, in the Word, in reference to Jehovah, or the Lord, signifies the Divine good of the Divine love. Because "David" means the Lord in respect to Divine truth proceeding from His Divine Human, He is called "David, my servant," "servant" meaning, in the Word, not a servant in the usual sense, but whatever serves, and it is predicated of truth because truth serves good for use, here for power.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>I will make a horn to bud forth unto David; I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed (<a href="../ae/62.htm">62</a>.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Jehovah my strength, my cliff, my fortress; my God, my rock, in which I confide, my shield and the horn of my salvation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_1.htm">Psalms 18:1-2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>).<p>"Strength" and "cliff" in reference, as here, to Jehovah or the Lord, signify omnipotence; "fortress" and "rock in which he confides" signify defense; "shield" and "horn of salvation" signify consequent salvation; "strength," "fortress," and "shield," in the Word are predicated of Divine good; "cliff," "rock," and "horn" are predicated of Divine truth; therefore these signify omnipotence, defense, and salvation, which Divine good has through Divine truth.</p><p>[11] In Luke:<p>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for He hath visited and redeemed His people, and hath raised up a horn of salvation in the house of David; that He might save us from our enemies (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_68.htm">Luke 1:68-69</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_71.htm">71</a>).<p>This is a prophecy of Zechariah respecting the Lord and His coming. "A horn of salvation in the house of David" signifies omnipotence to save by Divine truth from Divine good, "horn" is that omnipotence; "the house of David" is the Lord's church; "the enemies from which He should save" are the falsities of evil, for these are the enemies from which the Lord saves those who receive Him; it is known that there were no other enemies from which the Lord saved those who are here meant by his people.</p><p>[12] In Micah:<p>Rise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass, that thou mayest beat in pieces many peoples (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_4_13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>).<p>"Rise and thresh, O daughter of Zion" signifies the dispersion of evil with those who are of the church, "to thresh" is to disperse, and "daughter of Zion" is the church that is in the affection of good; "I will make thy horn iron" signifies Divine truth mighty and powerful; "I will make thy hoofs brass" has a like meaning, "hoofs" meaning truths in ultimates; "that thou mayest beat in pieces many peoples" signifies that thou mayest scatter falsities, for "peoples" are predicated of truths, and in a contrary sense, of falsities.</p><p>[13] In Zechariah:<p>I saw, and behold four horns, that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. He showed me four smiths, and He said, These horns that have scattered Judah, so that no man lifteth up his head; these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations that lift up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18-21</a>).<p>This describes the vastation of the church, and its subsequent restoration. "Judah," "Israel," and "Jerusalem," signify the church and its doctrine; "the horns that scattered them" signify the falsities of evil that have vastated the church; "smiths" signify the like as iron, namely, truth in ultimates, which is mighty and powerful, thus the like as the "horn of iron;" therefore it is said of them, "these have come to cast down the horns of the nations that lift up the horn against the land of Judah," "the horns of the nations" are the falsities of evil that have vastated the church, and that are to be dispersed that it may be restored.</p><p>[14] In Lamentations:<p>The Lord hath thrown in His fury the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath cast them down to the earth; He hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof; He hath cut off in the glowing of His anger every horn of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_2.htm">Lamentations 2:2-3</a>).<p>Here the total vastation of the church is treated of. The last time when it was laid waste is signified by the glowing of the Lord's anger; and its total vastation is described by "He hath thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah, He hath cast them down to the earth. He hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof;" "the daughter of Judah" is the church; "her strongholds" are truths from good; "the kingdom and princes" are its truths of doctrine; whence it is clear what is signified by "He hath cut off every horn of Israel," namely, the cutting off of all the power of truth in the church to resist the falsities of evil.</p><p>[15] In Daniel:<p>Daniel saw in a dream four beasts coming up out of the sea; the fourth exceedingly strong, having teeth of iron; it devoured and broke in pieces; and it had ten horns: and I gave heed, and behold another little horn came up among them, and three of the former horns were plucked up by the roots before it; in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. I saw that this horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; and that it spoke words against the Most High. As to the ten horns, they are ten kings, and it shall humble three kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7-8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_25.htm">25</a>).<p>Here evidently "horns" means the falsities that destroy the truths of the church, or the power of falsities against truths; "the beast coming up out of the sea" signifies the love of self out of which spring all evils; here the love of ruling over heaven and earth, to which things holy serve as means; it is such a love that is meant by "Babylon" in Revelation. This beast was seen "coming up out of the sea," because the "sea" signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual; for the natural man is then of such a character that he desires nothing so much as to have dominion over all, and to confirm that dominion by the sense of the letter of the Word. "The ten horns" signify falsities of every kind, for "ten" means all; therefore it is further said, that "the ten horns are ten kings," for "kings" signify truths, and in a contrary sense, as here, falsities. "The little horn that came up among them, before which three of the former horns were plucked up by the roots," signifies the complete perversion of the Word by the application of the sense of its letter to confirm the love of dominion. This horn is called "little," because it does not appear that the Word is perverted; and what does not appear before the sight of man's spirit, or before his understanding, is regarded either as nothing, or as little. In the spiritual world such is the appearance of things that are apprehended by a few only. "The three horns that were plucked up by the roots before it," signify the truths of the Word there that have been thus destroyed by falsifications; these truths are also signified by the "three kings" that were humbled by the horn, "three" not meaning three, but what is full, thus that truths were completely destroyed. As that "horn" signifies the perversion of the Word in respect to the sense of its letter, and as this sense appears before the eyes of men, as if it were to be understood thus and not otherwise, and therefore not to be gainsaid by anyone, it is said of this horn, "that in it there were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things," "eyes" signify understanding, and "eyes like the eyes of a man" an understanding as if of truth, and "mouth" signifies thought and speech from that understanding. From this it can now be seen what is meant by all and by each of the particulars here mentioned; as by "the beast coming up out of the sea, that had ten horns and teeth of iron, and devoured and broke in pieces;" by "the little horn that came up among them, before which three of the horns were plucked up by the roots, in which were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things;" also by "it made war with the saints and prevailed against them," and "it spoke words against the Most High;" and "the horns were so many kings."</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>I saw in a vision one ram that had two horns, and the horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher had come up last. It pushed westward, northward, and southward. Then, behold, a he-goat of the goats came from the west over the faces of the whole earth; he had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. He ran upon the ram in the wrath of his strength, and he broke his two horns, and he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him. But the great horn of the he-goat was broken; and in place of it there came up four toward the four winds of the heavens. Presently out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards beauty. And it grew even to the host of the heavens; and it cast down some of the host to the earth, and trampled upon them. Yea, even to the prince of the host it magnified itself, and the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down, because it cast down truth to the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">Daniel 8:2-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_25.htm">25</a>).<p>This describes a second thing that lays waste the church, namely, faith alone. The "ram" signifies the good of charity and faith therefrom, and the "he-goat" faith separate from charity, or faith alone, or, what is the same, those who are in these; their "horns" signify truths from good and falsities from evil, combating; truths from good are meant by the horns of the ram, and falsities from evil by the horns of the he-goat. That the "ram had two high horns, one higher than the other, and the higher came up last" signifies the truth of faith from the good of charity; and this was seen according to the influx of good and truth with man and spirit; for all good is received behind, and all truth in front, as the cerebellum is formed to receive the good, which is of the will, and the cerebrum to receive the truth, which is of the understanding; "westward, northward, and southward, toward which the ram pushed" signify the goods and truths that those receive who are in charity and in faith therefrom, by which they disperse evils and falsities; "the he-goat of the goats that came over the faces of the whole earth" signifies faith separate from charity, springing from evil of life; "the he-goat of the goats" is that faith; the "west" evil of life; and "the earth" the church; "he had a conspicuous horn between the eyes" signifies that this is from self-intelligence; "he ran upon the ram in the wrath of his strength, and brake his two horns, and cast him down to the earth, and trampled upon him" signifies the entire destruction of charity and of faith therefrom, for when charity is destroyed faith also is destroyed, for the latter is from the former; "the great horn of the he-goat was broken, and in place of it there came up four toward the four winds of the heavens" signifies all falsities conjoined with evils there from, "horns" signifying the falsities of evil, "four" their conjunction, and "the four winds of the heavens" all, both falsities and evils; "out of one of them came forth a little horn" signifies justification by faith, for this is born of the principle of faith alone; it is said to be "little" because it does not appear as a falsity.<p>That this horn "grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards beauty, and grew even to the host of the heavens, and cast down some of the host to the earth, and trampled upon them" signifies that it destroyed all the truths and goods of the church; "the south" meaning where truth is in the light, "the east" and "beauty" where good is in clearness through truth, "the host of the heavens" all truths and goods of heaven and the church; "to cast down the host to the earth, and to trample upon them" signifies to destroy utterly; that "even to the prince of the host it magnified itself," and that "the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down" signifies the denial of the Lord's Divine Human, and the consequent vastation of the church; "the prince of the host" is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, because from that proceed all the truths and goods that constitute the church; "the dwelling place of the sanctuary" is the church where these are; this plainly means the truths destroyed by falsities, for it is said, "it cast down truth to the earth." That this is the significance of the "ram," and the "he-goat," and "their horns," is clearly manifest from appearances in the spiritual world; for when such as have confirmed themselves in the doctrine of faith alone and of justification by faith, dispute there with those who are in the doctrine of charity and of faith therefrom, there appear to others who stand afar off he-goats, or a he-goat with similar horns, and with like onset and fury against the rams or the ram, and he appears also to tread the stars under his feet. These things have been seen by me also, and at the same time by those standing by, who were thereby confirmed that such things are meant in Daniel; and also that like things are meant by "the sheep on the right hand, and the goats on the left" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_32.htm">Matthew 25:32-46</a> the end), namely, by "sheep" those who are in the good of charity, and by "goats" those who are in faith alone. From these quotations from Daniel it can be seen in some measure what is signified in Revelation by:<p>The dragon that was seen having ten horns (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>);<p>The beast that was seen coming up out of the sea, which also had ten horns (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>).<p>The woman that was seen sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, that had seven heads and ten horns; respecting which the angel said, The ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12</a>);<p>but these things will be explained hereafter.</p><p>[17] That the power of falsity against truth is signified by "horn" or "horns" is evident also from the following passages. In Jeremiah:<p>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>).<p>"Moab" signifies those who are in spurious goods, and in falsified truths therefrom, which in themselves are falsities. The destruction of these falsities is signified by "The horn of Moab is cut off," and the destruction of these evils by "his arm is broken. "</p><p>[18] In Lamentations:<p>Jehovah hath caused the enemy to be glad over thee; He hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>).<p>Evil is meant by "enemy," and the falsities of evil by "adversaries;" "exalting the horn of the adversaries" is falsities prevailing over truths and destroying them.</p><p>[19] In Ezekiel:<p>Ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the sick sheep with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_21.htm">Ezekiel 34:21</a>).<p>"To thrust with side and with shoulder" is with all strength and endeavor; to "push the sick sheep with horns till ye have scattered them abroad" signifies to destroy by falsities the well-disposed, who are not yet in truths from good, and yet desire to be.</p><p>[20] In Amos:<p>In the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will visit upon the altars of Bethel, that the horns of the altar may be cut off, and fall to the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_3_14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>).<p>"The altars of Bethel" signify worship from evil, and "the horns of the altar" signify the falsities of that evil; and that these are to be destroyed is signified by "the horns shall be cut off and fall to the earth."</p><p>[21] In the same:<p>They who are glad over a thing of nought; who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_6_13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>).<p>"To take horns by our own strength" signifies by the powers of self-intelligence to acquire falsities by which truths will be destroyed.</p><p>[22] In David:<p>I said unto the boastful, Boast not; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn; Lift not up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck. All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; the horns of the righteous shall be exalted (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_4.htm">Psalms 75:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_10.htm">10</a>).<p>"Lifting up the horn on high" signifies to defend vigorously falsity against truth; therefore it is also said, "speak not with a stiff neck." "To cut off their horns" signifies to destroy their falsities; and "to exalt the horns of the righteous" signifies to make powerful and strong the truths of good.</p><p>[23] Because "making high and exalting the horns" signifies to fill with truths, and to make them powerful and strong against falsities, therefore those truths are also called "the horns of a unicorn," because these are high. As in Moses:<p>The firstborn of his ox, honor is his, and his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall push the peoples together to the uttermost parts of the earth; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Mannaseh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6417.htm">6417</a>). "The firstborn of the ox, honor is his," signifies the good of spiritual love; "his horns are the horns of a unicorn" signifies truths in their fullness, and in their power therefrom; "to push the peoples to the uttermost parts of the earth" signifies to instruct in truths all who are of the church, and to scatter falsities by means of truths; "the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh" signify the plenty and abundance of truth and of wisdom therefrom and the plenty and abundance of good and of love therefrom; "Ephraim," in the Word, signifying the intellectual of the church, which is of truth, and "Manasseh" the voluntary of the church which is of good (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6267.htm">6267</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6296.htm">6296</a>); and "ten thousands" and "thousands" signifying very many, thus plenty and abundance.</p><p>[24] In David:<p>Save me from the lion's mouth; and from the horns of the unicorn hear me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_22_21.htm">Psalms 22:21</a>);<p>"lion" signifying falsity vehemently destroying truth; and "horns of unicorns" truths that prevail against falsities.</p><p>[25] In the same:<p>My horn like the horn of a unicorn (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_92_10.htm">Psalms 92:10</a>);<p>"like the horn of a unicorn" signifying truth in its fullness and power.</p><p>[26] In Revelation:<p>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>).<p>The altar of incense, which was called also "the golden altar," was a representative of the hearing and reception of all things of worship that are from love and charity from the Lord, thus a representative of such things of worship as are elevated by the Lord; "the horns of the altar" represented truths proceeding from the good of love; this makes clear why a voice was heard from the four horns of the altar, for it is through truths that good acts and speaks.</p><p>[27] Altars had horns for the reason that altars represented the worship of the Lord from the good of love, and all worship that is truly worship is offered from the good of love by truths. That the altar of incense had horns is seen in Moses:<p>Thou shalt make four horns upon the altar of incense; they shall be from it. And thou shalt overlay them with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_2.htm">Exodus 30:2-3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_10.htm">10</a> (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>); <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_37_25.htm">Exodus 37:25-26</a>);<p>and the altar of burnt-offering elsewhere in the same:<p>Thou shalt make horns upon the four corners of the altar of burnt-offering; its horns shall be from it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_38_2.htm">38:2</a>).<p>That the horns were from the altar itself signified that the truths, which the horns represented, must proceed from the good of love, which the altar itself represented, for all truth is from good. That there were four horns, one at each corner, signified that they were for the four quarters in heaven, by which all things of truth from good are signified.</p><p>[28] Since all expiations and purifications are effected by truths from good, expiation was made upon the horns of the altars:<p>Upon the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>);<p>And upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_25.htm">Leviticus 4:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_9_9.htm">9:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_16_18.htm">16:18</a>).<p>And as all Divine protection is by truths from good:<p>Those who committed evils and were in fear of death caught hold of the horns of the altar and were thus protected (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_53.htm">53</a>).<p>When those who purposely and willfully committed evil were not so protected (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_2_28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-31</a>).<p>Moreover, because "horns" signified truths from good, therefore when kings were anointed this was done by oil out of a horn:<p>That David was so anointed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_16_1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_16_13.htm">13</a>); and Solomon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>);<p>the "oil" signifying the good of love. From this signification of horns, which was known to the ancients, it was customary to make horns budding forth and fragrant; from this came the word "cornucopia."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "Uncto," "anointed;" see n. <a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>. </p>

Ex his nunc videri potest quid per omnia et singula ibi intelligitur, ut quid per quod "bestia ascendens ex mari, cui decem cornua et dentes ferri, comederit et contriverit", per quod "cornu parvum ascenderit inter illa, coram quo tria de cornibus eradicata sunt, in quo oculi sicut oculi hominis, et os loquens magna", et per quod "faceret bellum cum sanctis et praevaluisset eis", et quod "loqueretur verba contra Altissimum", et quod "cornua" totidem essent "reges."</p><p>[16] Apud eundem,<p>"Vidi in visione.... arietem unum, .... cui duo cornua, et cornua alta, unum tamen altius altero, sed altum ascenderat posterius; feriebat versus occidentem, septentrionem et meridiem. ....
