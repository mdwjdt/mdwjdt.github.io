<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1068</h4><p>1068. Verses 12-14. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall deliver up their power and authority to the beast. These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and those that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful.<p>"And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings," signifies the truths of the Word as to power; "who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive power as kings one hour with the beast," signifies with those who have not thus acknowledged the Lord's power over heaven and earth as transferred to man, and who have attributed Divine sanctity to the Word, and not so to the edicts of the Pope.<p>"These have one mind, and shall deliver up their power and authority to the beast," signifies agreement that the Word is the Divine truth, on which the church as to its doctrine must depend.<p>"These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them," signifies that they shall have a contest with those who are meant by the whore about the sanctity of the Word, and the Lord's power to save men; and that the Lord will rescue those who are willing to be led of Him by the Word, and not by the woman, the whore; "for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings," signifies because the Lord is good itself and truth itself, and thence almighty; "and those that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful," signifies that those who love the Lord, and the neighbour, and have the faith of charity, are in the truth concerning the Lord's Divine power and the Divine sanctity of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1068</h4><p>1068. Verses 12-14. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give over their power and authority unto the beast. These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is the Lord of lords, and King of kings; also those who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful.<p>12. "And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings" signifies the truths of the Word as to power (n. <a href="../ae/1069.htm">1069</a>); "who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast," signifies with those who have not thus acknowledged that the Lord's authority over heaven and earth has been transferred to man, but have ascribed Divine holiness to the Word, and not to the decrees of the Pope (n. <a href="../ae/1070.htm">1070</a>).<p>13. "These have one mind, and shall give over their power and authority unto the beast," signifies the unanimity of such that the Word is the Divine truth, on which the church must depend as to its doctrine (n. <a href="../ae/1071.htm">1071</a>).<p>14. "These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them," signifies that these must contend with those meant by the "harlot" concerning the holiness of the Word and the Lord's authority to save men, and that the Lord has delivered those who have been willing to be led by Him by means of the Word, and not by the woman the harlot (n. <a href="../ae/1072.htm">1072</a>); "for He is the Lord of lords and King of kings," signifies for the Lord is good itself and truth itself, and thus omnipotent (n. <a href="../ae/1073.htm">1073</a>); "also those who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful," signifies that those who are in love to the Lord, in love towards the neighbor, and in the faith of charity, have the truth respecting the Lord's Divine power and Divine holiness of the Word (n. <a href="../ae/1074.htm">1074</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1068 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1068. VERSUS 12-14.<p>"Et decem cornua, quae vidisti, decem reges sunt, qui regnum nondum acceperunt, sed potestatem tanquam reges unam horam accipiunt cum bestia. Hi unam sententiam habent, et potentiam et potestatem suam bestiae tradent. Hi cum Agno pugnabunt, et Agnus vincet illos, quia Dominus dominorum est, et Rex regum; et qui cum Ipso, vocati et electi et fideles."<p>12. "Et decem cornua, quae vidisti, decem reges sunt", significat vera Verbi quoad potentiam (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1068/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1069" target=_top>1069</a>); "qui regnum nondum acceperunt, sed potestatem tanquam reges unam horam accipiunt cum bestia", significat apud illos qui non ita agnoverunt potestatem Domini super caelum et terram in hominem translatam, et qui Divinam sanctitatem addixerunt Verbo, et non ita dictatis Papae (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1068/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1070" target=_top>1070</a>).<p>13. "Hi unam sententiam habent, et potentiam et potestatem suam bestiae tradent", significat unanimitatem, quod Verbum sit Divinum Verum, a quo ecclesia quoad doctrinam suam dependet (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1068/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1071" target=_top>1071</a>).<p>14. "Hi cum Agno pugnabunt, et Agnus vincet illos", significat quod litem habituri sint cum illis qui intelliguntur per "meretricem", de sanctitate Verbi, et de potestate Domini ad salvandum homines, et quod Dominus exemerit illos qui ad Ipso per Verbum, et non a muliere meretrice, voluerunt duci (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1068/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1072" target=_top>1072</a>); "quid Dominus dominorum est, et Rex regum", significat quia Dominus est ipsum Bonum et ipsum Verum, et inde omnipotens (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1068/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1073" target=_top>1073</a>); "et qui cum Ipso, vocati et electi et fideles", significat illos qui in amore in Dominum, in amore erga proximum, et in fide charitatis sunt, in veritate esse de Divina potentia Domini et de Divina sanctitate Verbi (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1068/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1074" target=_top>1074</a>). </p>
