<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 599</h4><p>599. And he had in his hand a little book open.- That this signifies the Word manifested, is evident from the signification of a little book open, as denoting the Word manifested. That this is denoted by the little book open, is clear from this fact, that by the strong angel coming down out of heaven, and having in his hand the little book, is represented the Lord as to the Word, and indeed as to its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter (see above, n. <a href="../ae/593.htm">593</a>); and since the Word is manifested as well to angels as to men, it is therefore said, a little book open. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 599</h4><p>599. Verse 2. And he had in his hand a little book opened, signifies the Word laid open. This is evident from the signification of "a little book opened," as being the Word laid open. It can be seen that this is what is meant by "the little book opened," since "the strong angel coming down out of heaven, who had in his hand a little book," represented the Lord as to the Word, and in fact, as to its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter (See above, n. <a href="../ae/593.htm">593</a>); and because the Word was laid open both to angels and men it is said "a little book opened." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 599 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>599. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_10_2" target=_top>2</a>.] "Et habebat in manu sua libellum apertum." - Quod significet Verbum manifestatum constat ex significatione "libelli aperti", quod sit Verbum manifestatum; quod libellus apertus id sit, constare potest ex eo, quod per "angelum fortem descendentem e caelis, qui habebat in manu libellum", repraesentetur Dominus quoad Verbum, et quidem quoad sensum ejus ultimum, qui vocatur sensus litterae (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_599/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_593" target=_top>593</a>); et quia Verbum manifestatum est tam angelis et hominibus, ideo dicitur "libellus apertus." </p>
