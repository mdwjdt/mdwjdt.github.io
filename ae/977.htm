<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 977</h4><p>977. For they are worthy. That this signifies, that it is done to them as they themselves do, is evident from the signification of being worthy, namely, that they are in falsities of evil, because they have falsified the truths of the Word and of doctrine; this being signified by its being given to them to drink the blood of the saints and of the prophets which they have shed, consequently, that it is done to them as they themselves have done. For it is according to order that one's works do follow every one, and judge every one; and hence it is done to every one as he himself has done. This, therefore, is what is meant here by being worthy, or having so merited.<p>Continuation concerning the Fifth Precept:-</p><p>[2] There are, for example, the administrators of the goods of others, higher and lower. These, if they deprive their kings, their countries, or their masters, of their goods, either clandestinely by any arts, or under pretence by fraud, have no religion, and consequently no conscience. For they hold in contempt the Divine law concerning theft, and make it of no account. Such persons, although they frequent places of worship, are devout in hearkening to preachings, attend the sacrament of the Supper, pray morning and evening, and speak piously from the Word, yet, notwithstanding all this, nothing from heaven flows in, and nothing of heaven is in their worship, piety, or discourse, their interiors are full of thefts, rapines, robberies, and injustice, and so long as these evils are within, the way into their minds from heaven is closed; therefore the works which they do are all evil.</p><p>[3] But the administrators of goods, who shun unlawful gains and fraudulent profits, because they are against the Divine law concerning theft, have religion, consequently, also, conscience. The works, moreover, which they do are all good, for they act from sincerity for the sake of it, and from justice for the sake of it. They are also content with their own, feel cheerfulness of mind, and gladness of heart, as often as they bethink themselves that they have not been guilty of fraud. And after death they are welcomed by the angels and received by them as brothers, and are presented with goods abundantly. But it is quite different with evil administrators. These after death are cast out from societies, and afterwards ask for aid, and at length are sent into the caverns of robbers to labour there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 977</h4><p>977. For they are worthy, signifies that it is done to them as they do. This is evident from the signification of "being worthy," namely, that they are in falsities of evil because they have falsified the truths of the Word and of doctrine, which is signified by "it was given to them to drink the blood of the saints and of the prophets, which they poured out," consequently that it is done to them as they have done. For it is according to order that his works follow everyone and judge everyone; thus it is done to everyone as he has done; therefore this is here meant by "being worthy," that is, having so deserved.<p>(Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment)</p><p>[2] Take as an example managers of the goods of others, higher and lower. If these secretly by arts or under some pretext by fraud deprive their kings, their country, or their masters of their goods, they have no religion and thus no conscience, for they hold the Divine law respecting theft in contempt and make it of no account. And although they frequent temples, devoutly listen to preachings, observe the sacrament of the Supper, pray morning and evening, and talk piously from the Word, yet nothing from heaven flows in and is present in their worship, piety, or discourse, because their interiors are full of theft, plundering, robbery, and injustice; and so long as these are within, the way into them from heaven is closed; consequently all the works they do are evil.</p><p>[3] But the managers of property who shun unlawful gains and fraudulent profits because they are contrary to the Divine law respecting theft, have religion, and thus also conscience; and all the works they do are good, for they act from sincerity for the sake of sincerity, and from justice for the sake of justice, and furthermore are content with their own, and are cheerful in mind and glad in heart whenever it happens that they have refrained from fraud; and after death they are welcomed by the angels and received by them as brothers, and are presented with goods even to abundance. But the opposite is true of evil managers; these after death are cast out of societies, and afterwards seek alms, and finally are sent into the caverns of robbers to labor there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 977 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>977. "Digni enim sunt." - Quod significet quod fiat illis sicut faciunt, constat ex significatione "digni esse", nempe ut in falsis mali sint, quia falsificaverunt vera Verbi et doctrinae, quae significantur per quod "illis datum sit bibere sanguinem sanctorum et prophetarum [quem] effuderunt", consequenter ut fiat illis sicut fecerunt; nam ex ordine est ut opera sua unumquemvis sequantur, et unumquemvis judicent; inde fit cuivis sicut fecerat: hoc itaque intelligitur hic per "dignum esse", seu tale meruisse.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Quinto Praecepto.)<p>Sint pro exemplo Administratores bonorum aliorum, superiores et inferiores:-Hi si suos reges, suam patriam, aut suos dominos deprivant bonis vel clandestine per artes, vel sub specie per fraudes, sunt nullius religionis et inde nullius conscientiae, nam Divinam legem de furto vilipendunt et nihili faciunt. Hi tametsi frequentant templa, devoti sunt in auscultandis praedicationibus, obeunt Sacramentum Cenae, orant mane et vespere, et loquuntur pie ex Verbo, usque tamen nihil e caelo influit, et inest cultui, pietati, et sermoni eorum, quia interiora eorum sunt plena furtis, rapinis, latrociniis, et injustitia; et quamdiu haec insunt, via in illos e caelo clausa est: inde opera quae faciunt sunt omnia mala.<p>[3] At Vero administratores bonorum qui fugiunt lucrationes illegitimas, ac quaestus fraudulentos, quia contra legem Divinam de furto sunt, illi religionem habent, proinde etiam conscientiam, ac opera quae faciunt sunt omnia bona; nam faciunt ex sinceritate propter illam, et ex justitia propter illam; et praeterea sunt contenti suis, hilares animo ac laeti corde quoties obvenit quod non defraudaverint: et post mortem angelis accepti sunt, ac recipiuntur ab illis ut fratres, et donantur bonis usque ut abundent. Vicissim autem administratores mali; hi post mortem ejiciuntur societatibus, et dein stipem quaerunt, et tandem in cavernas praedonum ad laborandum mittuntur. </p>
