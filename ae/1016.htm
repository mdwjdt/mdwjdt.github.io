<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1016</h4><p>1016. Such as was not since there were men on the earth. That this signifies that it was manifestly more inverted than ever before in the countries where the church is, is evident from the signification of the earthquake being such, as denoting the state of the church changed more than hitherto, thus manifestly inverted; and from the signification of the men who were upon the earth, as denoting with those who belong to the church, thus who are in the countries where the church is. The subject here treated of is especially the state of the church with the Reformed, not with the Babylonians, these being treated of afterwards. That the state of the church has been turned into its contrary, is evident from this, that at this day it is not known what good and truth are, nor, indeed, what love and faith are; for love they call faith; works they call faith; good they call faith; truth they call faith; and yet they do not at all see whether the received faith, in which everything of the church is included, is the faith of truth, because it consists of mere incomprehensibilities.<p>Continuation concerning the Seventh Precept:-</p><p>[2] Because hatred is infernal fire, it is clear that it must be removed before love, which is heavenly fire, can flow in, and by the light from itself give life to a man; and that infernal fire cannot possibly be removed, unless he knows the origin of hatred, and what it is, and afterwards turns away from it and shuns it.<p>Hatred of the neighbour is hereditarily in every man, for every one is born into the love of self and of the world. Wherefore, he conceives hatred, and from it he is inflamed against all those who do not make one with him, and favour him, especially against those who oppose his lusts. For no one can love himself above all things, and, at the same time, love the Lord; and no one can love the world above all things, and, at the same time, love his neighbour, because no one can serve two masters at the same time; he is bound to despise and hate the one, while he honours and loves the other. Hatred especially prevails with those who are in the love of ruling over all; with the rest it is enmity.</p><p>[3] What hatred is shall also be stated. Hatred has in itself a fire, which is the endeavour to kill men; that fire is shown by anger. There is, as it were, a hatred and an anger thence prevalent with the good against evil. This, however, is not hatred but aversion to evil. Nor is it anger, but a zeal from good, in which heavenly fire inwardly lies concealed. For they turn away from evil, and are as if they were angry at their neighbour, in order that they may remove the evil, and thereby consult for the good of their neighbour. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1016</h4><p>1016. Such as was not since men were upon the earth, signifies that the state was more completely inverted than ever before in the countries where the church is. This is evident from the signification of "there was not such an earthquake," as being that the state of the church was more changed than heretofore, thus completely inverted; also from the signification of "the men that were upon the earth," as being with those who are of the church, thus who are in the countries where the church is. Here the state of the church with the Reformed is especially treated of, while the church with the Babylonians will be treated of hereafter. And that the state of the church has been turned into its opposite is clear from this, that it is not known at this day what good is, nor what truth nor even what love is, nor what faith is; for love is called faith, works are called faith, good is called faith, truth is called faith, and yet it is not in the least seen whether the accepted faith, in which everything of the church is included, be a faith in truth, since it consists of mere incomprehensible things.<p>(Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment)</p><p> [2] Since hatred is infernal fire it is clear that it must be removed before love, which is heavenly fire, can flow in, and by light from itself give life to man; and this infernal fire can in no wise be removed unless man knows whence hatred is and what it is, and afterwards turns away from it and shuns it. There is in every man by inheritance hatred against the neighbor; for every man is born into the love of self and of the world, and in consequence conceives hatred, and from it is inflamed against all who do not make one with him and favor his love, especially against those who oppose his lusts. For no one can love himself above all things and love the Lord at the same time; neither can anyone love the world above all things and love the neighbor at the same time; since no one can serve two masters at the same time without despising and hating the one while he honors and loves the other. Hatred is especially with those who are in the love of ruling over all; with others it is enmity.</p><p>[3] It shall be told what hatred is. Hatred has in itself a fire which is an endeavor to kill man. That fire is manifested by anger. There is a seeming hatred and consequent anger with the good against evil; but this is not hatred, but an aversion to evil; neither is it anger, but a zeal for good in which heavenly fire inwardly lies concealed. For the good turn away from evil, and are seemingly angry at the neighbor, in order that they may remove the evil; and thus they have regard to the neighbor's good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1016 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1016. "Qualis non factus est ex quo homines facti sunt super terra." - Quod significet quod plane inversus fuerit, plus quam hactenus fuerat in terris ubi ecclesia, constat ex significatione "qualis terrae motus non factus est", quod sit status ecclesiae ita mutatus ut plus quam hactenus, ita plane conversus; et ex significatione "hominum factorum super terra", quod sit apud illos qui ab ecclesia, ita in terris ubi ecclesia. Agitur hic imprimis de statu ecclesiae apud Reformatos, non apud Babylonios, de his enim in sequentibus agitur. Quod status ecclesiae in contrarium conversus sit, patet ex eo, quod hodie non sciatur quid bonum nec quid verum, immo nec quid amor et quid fides; amorem enim vocant fidem, opera vocant fidem, bonum vocant fidem, verum vocant fidem, et ne hilum vident num fides recepta, in qua concluditur omne ecclesiae, sit fides veri, quoniam ex meris incomprehensibilibus consistit.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Septimo Praecepto.)<p>Quoniam odium est ignis infernalis, patet quod id removendum sit, antequam amor, qui est ignis caelestis, potest influere, et per lucem a se vivificare hominem; et infernalis ille ignis nullatenus removeri potest, nisi homo sciat unde odium, et quid odium, et postea id aversetur et fugiat. Unicuique homini ex hereditate est odium contra proximum; nam omnis homo in amorem sui et mundi nascitur; quare odium capit, et ex illo ignescit contra omnes qui non unum cum illo faciunt et ei favent, imprimis qui ejus concupiscentiis obstant; nemo enim potest se super omnia amare, et simul amare Dominum; et nemo potest mundum super omnia amare et simul amare proximum; quia nemo potest duobus dominis simul servire, quin unum contemnat et odio habeat, alterum honoret et amet. Odium est imprimis apud illos qui in amore imperandi super omnes sunt; apud reliquos est inimicitia.<p>[3] Dicetur etiam quid odium. Odium in se habet ignem, qui est conatus occidendi hominem; ignis ille manifestatur per iram: datur quasi odium et inde ira apud bonos contra malum, at non est odium sed aversatio pro malo, nec est ira sed est zelus pro bono, in quibus intus latet ignis caelestis; nam aversantur malum, et quasi irascuntur proximo, ut malum removeant, et sic bono proximi consulant. </p>
