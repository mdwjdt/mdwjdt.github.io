<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 283</h4><p>283. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_8.htm">5:8</a>) And the four animals had, each by itself, six wings roundabout. That this signifies the appearance of the spiritual Divine on every side around the celestial Divine, is evident from the signification of the four animals, which were cherubim, as being the Divine guardianship and providence of the Lord that the higher heavens may not be approached except by the good of love and of charity. And because this is signified by the four animals, as to their bodies, the celestial Divine is also signified, concerning which we shall treat presently; and from the signification of six wings roundabout, as denoting the spiritual Divine around the celestial Divine, concerning which we shall also speak in what follows. The reason why the cherubim, as to their bodies, signifies the celestial Divine, and as to their wings the spiritual Divine, is that all things by which celestial things are represented, as to the bodies themselves signify things essential, and as to the things which are about them they signify things formal. Hence man also as to the body signifies good in essence, and as to those things which encompass it, good in form; celestial good is good in essence, and spiritual good is good in form; and this for the reason that the will, in which good resides, is the man himself, or the man in essence, and the understanding, in which truth is, which is the form of good, is the man therefrom, thus man in form; the latter good is also around the former.</p><p>[2] But it shall first be explained what the celestial Divine is, and what the spiritual Divine. The heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, of which the one is called the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom. The distinction lies in this, that those who are in the celestial kingdom are in the good of love to the Lord, and those who are in the spiritual kingdom are in the good of charity towards the neighbour; hence the celestial Divine is the good of love to the Lord, and the spiritual Divine is the good of charity towards the neighbour. According to these goods also the heavens are arranged: the highest or third heaven consists of those who are in celestial good, or in the good of love to the Lord; and the heaven which succeeds it, and is called the middle or second heaven, consists of those who are in spiritual good, or in the good of charity towards the neighbour; and because celestial good is good in the highest place, and spiritual good is good in the second place, therefore the latter is around the former, for that which is above is also within, and that which is below is also without, and what is without is also around. Hence it is that in the Word by higher things, and things which are in the midst, are signified interior things, and by lower things, and things which are around, are signified exterior things.<p>Now because both celestial and spiritual good, guard, and as by the animals themselves, or by the cherubim as to their bodies, is signified the celestial Divine, and by the same as to their wings is signified the spiritual Divine, it is clear that by their being seen as having each by itself six wings about, is signified the appearance of the spiritual Divine on every side around the celestial Divine. (But concerning these things a fuller idea may be formed from what is said and shown in the work, Heaven and Hell. First, from the article in which it is shown that the Divine of the Lord makes heaven, n. <a href="../hh/7.htm">7-12</a>; afterwards from the article, That the Divine of the Lord in heaven is love to Him and charity towards the neighbour, n. <a href="../hh/13.htm">13-19</a>: and lastly, in the article, That heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms, a celestial kingdom and a spiritual kingdom, n. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>.)</p><p>[3] The reason why the cherubim were seen as animals is, that celestial things are represented in various ways in ultimates, as is evident from many passages in the Word; as, that the Holy Spirit appeared as a dove over Jesus when He was baptized (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_17.htm">17</a>); and that the Divine of the Lord appeared as a lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_6.htm">Apoc. 5:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_13.htm">13</a>), whence also the Lord is called a lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">Apoc. 6:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_16.htm">16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_9.htm">7:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_11.htm">12:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_8.htm">13:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_4.htm">4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_14.htm">17:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_22.htm">21:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_27.htm">27</a>). The reason why the cherubim were four, and why each had six wings is, that by four is signified celestial good, and by six spiritual good. For the number four signifies conjunction, and inmost conjunction with the Lord is effected by means of love to Him; but the number six signifies communication, and communication with the Lord is effected by means of charity towards the neighbour.</p><p>[4] That wings signify the spiritual Divine which in its essence is truth from good, is evident from the following passages. In David:<p>"If ye have lain among the ranks; the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold; when thou, O Shaddai, spreadest out, kings are in it" (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>).</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>God "rode upon a cherub, he did fly; he was carried upon the wings of the wind" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>).<p>By God riding upon a cherub is signified His Divine providence; by did fly, is signified His omnipresence in the spiritual world; he was carried upon the wings of the wind, denotes His omnipresence in the natural world; the wings of the wind signify spiritual things from which are natural things.</p><p>[6] Again:<p>Jehovah "covereth thee under his wing, and under the abyss shalt thou trust; truth is a shield and buckler" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_4.htm">Psalms 91:4</a>).<p>To cover under wings signifies to be guarded by the Divine truth, which is the spiritual Divine; and to trust under the abyss signifies truth scientific (verum scientificum), or the natural Divine. And because both the latter and the former signify truth, and being covered signifies protection thereby, it is therefore said, truth a shield and buckler. From these considerations it is also evident what is signified<p>By being hid under the shadow of God's wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_17_8.htm">Psalms 17:8</a>).<p>By the children of men putting their trust under the shadow of His wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_36_7.htm">Psalms 36:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_57_1.htm">57:1</a>);<p>and also<p>By singing under the shadow of His wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_63_7.htm">Psalms 63:7</a>).<p>That wing, when said of the Lord, signifies the spiritual Divine, is further evident from the following passages.</p><p>[7] In Ezekiel:<p>"When I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of loves, I spread my wing over thee, and I covered thy nakedness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_8.htm">16:8</a>).<p>Here the church and its reformation is treated of, and is signified by Jerusalem; the time of loves signifies the state when it could be reformed. I spread my wing over thee, signifies spiritual truth, by which reformation is effected; and I covered thy nakedness, signifies the hiding of evil thereby; for the evil which man has from his hereditary nature and afterwards from his proprium is hidden, that is, it is removed so as not to appear, by means of spiritual truths, which are truths from good.</p><p>[8] In David:<p>Jehovah "covereth himself with light as with a garment; he stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain; he layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; he maketh the clouds his chariot; he walketh upon the wings of the wind" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_2.htm">Psalms 104:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_3.htm">3</a>).<p>By the light with which Jehovah is said to cover Himself is signified the Divine truth in the heavens, which is called His garment because it proceeds from Him as the Sun, and so is without and about Him. The signification of this passage is similar to that of those which treat of the Lord's transfiguration, and of the light which then beamed from His face and His raiment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_28.htm">Luke 9:28-37</a>). By he stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain, is signified Jehovah's filling heaven and its inhabitants with the Divine truth, and thereby with intelligence. He layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, denotes His filling with the knowledges of truth and good those who are in the ultimate heaven and who are in the church; he maketh the clouds his chariot, signifies the doctrine of truth from the literal sense of the Word; the clouds denote that sense, and chariot denotes doctrine; He walketh upon the wings of the wind, signifies the spiritual sense of the Word contained in the literal sense.</p><p>[9] In Malachi:<p>"But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise and healing in his wings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_4_2.htm">4:2</a>).<p>The Sun of righteousness signifies the good of love, which is the celestial Divine; and the wings of Jehovah in which there is healing signify truth from that good, which is the spiritual Divine: healing denotes reformation thereby.</p><p>[10] In Moses:<p>"As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, beareth them on her wings; so Jehovah alone doth lead him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_12.htm">12</a>).<p>Here comparison is made with an eagle, because an eagle signifies intelligence, and wings signify the spiritual Divine, which is Divine truth, whence that intelligence is derived.</p><p>[11] In Isaiah:<p>"They that wait for Jehovah renew their strength, they mount up with wings as eagles" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_31.htm">40:31</a>).<p>To mount up with wings as eagles denotes to ascend into the light of heaven, which is Divine truth, or the spiritual Divine from which is intelligence.</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>"In the mountain of the height will I plant it, that it may lift up the bough and bear fruit, and become a magnificent cedar, that under it may dwell every bird of every wing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_17_23.htm">17:23</a>).<p>By a magnificent cedar is signified the spiritual church; by every bird of every wing, are signified intellectual things which are derived from spiritual truths.<p>From these considerations it is now evident that the wings of the cherubim, both here and elsewhere in the Word, signify the spiritual Divine, which is the Divine truth instructing, regenerating and defending.</p><p>[13] As also in Ezekiel:<p>"There were four faces to each "cherub," and four wings to each; their wings erect one to the other; each of them had wings covering their bodies. I heard the sound of the wings as it were the sound of great waters, as the voice of Shaddai; when they went, the voice of a tumult, as the voice of a camp; when they stood they let down their wings. I heard the voice of their wings kissing each the other, and the voice of wheels near them: the voice of the wings of the cherubim was heard at the court without, as the voice of God Shaddai; the likeness of hands was under their wings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_4.htm">1:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_13.htm">3:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_5.htm">10:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_21.htm">21</a>).<p>That wings here signify the spiritual Divine, which is the Divine truth of the Lord in His celestial kingdom, is evident from each particular of the above description. The wings being four, signifies the spiritual Divine in that kingdom; their wings being erect one to the other and kissing each other, signifies the association and conjunction of all who are in that kingdom by the Lord; the wings covering their bodies, signifies the spiritual Divine encompassing the celestial Divine; the sound of their wings being heard as the sound of great waters, and as the sound of wheels and as the voice of Shaddai, and the voice of the wings being heard even to the outer court, signifies the quality of the spiritual Divine, or of the Divine truth in the ultimate heaven; for voice is said of truth. Waters also signify truths, and the perception of them; wheels signify the truths of all doctrinals, because a chariot signifies doctrine. God Shaddai denotes truth rebuking in temptations, and afterwards consoling; the outer court denotes the ultimate heaven; the likeness of hands under the wings signifies the power of Divine truth.</p><p>[14] From these considerations it may also be seen what was signified by the wings of the cherubim which were upon the mercy-seat which was over the ark, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>"Make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end; even of the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof. And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings upwards, covering with their wings upon the mercy-seat, and their faces of a man to his brother; towards the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. And thou shalt put the mercy-seat upon the ark from above; and to the ark thou shalt give the testimony that I shall give thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_19.htm">Exodus 25:19-21</a>).<p>By the cherubim here mentioned is in like manner signified the providence of the Lord as to guardianship, lest the highest heaven, or the celestial kingdom, should be approached except by the good of love from the Lord and to the Lord. By the testimony, or law, placed in the ark, is signified the Lord Himself; by the ark, the inmost or highest heaven; by the mercy-seat, the hearing and reception of all things of worship which are from the good of love, and expiation at the time; by the wings of the cherubim is signified the spiritual Divine in that heaven, or in that kingdom. By the wings being stretched forth upwards, and by their covering the mercy-seat, and their faces being toward it is signified reception itself and hearing (but these things may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, from n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>).</p><p>[15] Because most expressions in the Word have also an opposite meaning, so also have wings, in which they signify falsities and reasonings from them; as in the Apocalypse:<p>"Out of the smoke of the pit of the abyss went forth locusts. And the voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to battle" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_2.htm">9:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Locusts signify falsities in extremes, and horses reasonings from them, and battle signifies the combat of falsity against truth; hence it is said, the voice of the wings of the locust was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to battle.</p><p>[16] In Hosea:<p>"Ephraim is joined to idols. Their wine is sour; in whoring they have committed whoredom. The wind hath bound her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed of their sacrifices" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_17.htm">4:17-19</a>).<p>By Ephraim is signified the Intellectual, such as it is with those within the church who are enlightened when they read the Word. By idols are signified falsities of doctrine, hence by Ephraim being joined to idols is signified the Intellectual perverted, and seizing on falsities; by their wine being sour is signified the quality of the truth of the church, wine denoting that truth; by their committing whoredom is signified their falsifying truths, whoredom denoting the falsification of truth; by the wind binding her up in its wings is signified reasonings from fallacies, whence come falsities. (What fallacies in spiritual things are may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_9.htm">Zechariah 5:9</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 283</h4><p>283. Verse 8. And the four animals, each by itself, had six wings round about, signifies the appearance of the spiritual Divine on all sides about the celestial Divine. This is evident from the signification of the four animals, which were the cherubim, as being the Lord's Divine guard and providence that the higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and of charity; and as this is the significance of the four animals as regards their bodies, they signify also the celestial Divine (of which presently). It is evident also from the signification of "six wings round about," as meaning the spiritual Divine round about the celestial Divine (of which also presently). The "cherubim" in respect to their bodies signify the celestial Divine, and in respect to their wings the spiritual Divine; because all things that represent heavenly things signify in respect to their bodies what is essential, and in respect to what is about them what is formal. So man also, in respect to his body signifies good in essence, and in respect to the encompassing things good in form. Celestial good is good in essence, and spiritual good is good in form; and this for the reason that the will, in which good resides, is man himself, or the man in essence; while the understanding in which is truth, which is the form of good, is the man thence derived, thus man in form; this good also is round about the other.</p><p>[2] But let it be told first what the celestial Divine is, and what the spiritual Divine is. The heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one of which is called the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom. They differ in this, that those in the celestial kingdom are in the good of love to the Lord, and those in the spiritual kingdom are in the good of charity towards the neighbor. Therefore the celestial Divine is the good of love to the Lord, and the spiritual Divine is the good of charity towards the neighbor. Moreover, according to these goods the heavens are arranged; the highest or third heaven consists of those who are in celestial good, or in the good of love to the Lord; and the heaven that succeeds this, and is called the middle or second heaven, consists of those who are in spiritual good, or in the good of charity towards the neighbor; and as celestial good is good in the highest place, and spiritual good is good in the second place, therefore the latter is round about the former; for that which is above is also within, and that which is below is also without, and what is without is round about. This is why in the Word higher things, and things in the midst, signify things interior; and lower things, and things round about, signify things exterior. Now as each good, the celestial and the spiritual, guards, and as the "animals," that is, the cherubim, in respect to their bodies signify the celestial Divine, and in respect to their wings the spiritual Divine, it is clear that by "the four animals, each by itself, were seen to have six wings round about," the appearance of the spiritual Divine on all sides round about the celestial Divine is signified. (But a fuller idea of these things can be had from what is said and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell; first, from the chapter where it is shown that The Divine of the Lord makes Heaven, n. <a href="../hh/7.htm">7-12</a>; then from the chapter, The Divine of the Lord in Heaven is Love to Him, and Charity towards the Neighbor, n. <a href="../hh/13.htm">13-19</a>; and lastly, in the chapter, Heaven is divided into two Kingdoms, a Celestial Kingdom and a Spiritual Kingdom, n. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>.)</p><p>[3] The cherubim were seen as animals because heavenly things are represented in ultimates in various ways, as can be seen from many passages in the Word; as:<p>That the Holy Spirit appeared as a dove over Jesus when He was baptized (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>).<p>And that the Divine of the Lord appeared as a lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_13.htm">13</a>).<p>And from this the Lord was also called a Lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_9.htm">7:9-10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_11.htm">12:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_8.htm">13:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_14.htm">17:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_7.htm">19:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_22.htm">21:22-23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_27.htm">27</a>).<p>There were "four cherubim," and "each had six wings," because "four" signifies celestial good, and "six" spiritual good; for "four" signifies conjunction, and inmost conjunction with the Lord is through love to Him; but "six" signifies communication, and communication with the Lord is by means of charity towards the neighbor.</p><p>[4] That "wings" signify the spiritual Divine, which in its essence is truth from good, can be seen from the following passages. In David:<p>If ye have lain among the ranks, [ye shall have] the wings of a dove overlaid with silver, and her pinions with the yellow of gold; when Thou, Shaddai, dost spread out, kings shall be in it (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>).</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>God rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>).<p>"God rode upon a cherub" signifies the Lord's Divine Providence; "He did fly" signifies omnipresence in the spiritual world; "He was borne upon the wings of the wind" signifies omnipresence in the natural world; "wings of the wind" are things spiritual, from which are things natural.</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>Jehovah covereth thee under His pinion, and under His wings shalt thou trust; truth is a shield and a buckler (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_4.htm">Psalms 91:4</a>).<p>"To cover under the pinion" signifies to guard by Divine truth, which is the spiritual Divine; and "to trust under His wings" signifies under truth known [verum scientificum], which is the spiritual natural Divine; and as both signify truth, and "to cover" signifies guarding by means of it, it is said, "truth is a shield and a buckler." This makes clear what is signified:<p>By being hidden under the shadow of God's wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_17_8.htm">Psalms 17:8</a>);<p>By putting trust under the shadow of His wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_36_7.htm">Psalms 36:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_57_1.htm">57:1</a>);<p>Also by singing under the shadow of His wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_63_7.htm">Psalms 63:7</a>).</p><p>[7] That "wing" in reference to the Lord signifies the spiritual Divine is further evident from the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>When I passed by thee, and saw thee, that behold thy time was the time of loves, I spread My wing over thee, and I covered thy nakedness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>).<p>Here Jerusalem is treated of, and by it the church is meant, here its reformation; "the time of loves" signifies the state when it could be reformed; "I spread My wing over thee" signifies spiritual truth by which reformation is effected; "I covered thy nakedness" signifies putting evil out of sight thereby; for the evil that man has by heredity and afterwards from what is his own [ex proprio] is put out of sight, that is, so removed as not to appear, by spiritual truths, which are truths from good.</p><p>[8] In David:<p>Jehovah covereth Himself with light as with a garment; He stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain; He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters; He maketh the clouds His chariot; He walketh upon the wings of the wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_2.htm">Psalms 104:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_3.htm">3</a>).<p>The "light with which Jehovah covereth Himself" signifies Divine truth in the heavens; it is called His "garment" because it proceeds from Him as a sun, and is thus outside of Him and about Him. This has a like meaning with the "light" and "the garments" of the Lord, when He was transfigured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_28.htm">Luke 9:28-37</a>). "He stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain" signifies filling heaven and them that are therein with Divine truth, and thereby with intelligence; "He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters" means to fill those who are in the ultimate heaven and in the church with the knowledges of truth and good; "He maketh the clouds His chariot" signifies the doctrine of truth from the literal sense of the Word, "clouds" mean that sense, and "chariot" doctrine; "to walk upon the wings of the wind" signifies the spiritual sense of the Word contained in the literal sense.</p><p>[9] In Malachi:<p>Unto you that fear My name shall the Sun of righteousness arise, and healing in His wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_4_2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>).<p>"The Sun of righteousness" signifies the good of love, which is the celestial Divine; and the "wings of Jehovah, in which there is healing," signify truth from that good, which is the spiritual Divine; "healing" is reformation thereby.</p><p>[10] In Moses:<p>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, beareth them on her wings, so Jehovah doth lead him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_12.htm">12</a>).<p>Here comparison is made with an "eagle," because "eagle" signifies intelligence, and "wing" the spiritual Divine, which is Divine truth, from which is intelligence.</p><p>[11] In Isaiah:<p>They that wait upon Jehovah renew their strength, they mount up with a wing like eagles (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p>"To mount up with a wing like eagles" is to ascend into the light of heaven, which is Divine truth or the spiritual Divine from which is intelligence.</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>The mountain of height will I plant it; that it may lift up the bough and bear fruit, and become a magnificent cedar; that under it may dwell every bird of every wing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_17_23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>). "A magnificent cedar" signifies the spiritual church; "every bird of every wing" signifies things intellectual which are from spiritual truths.<p>From this it can be seen what "the wings of the cherubim," both here and elsewhere in the Word, signify, namely, the spiritual Divine, which is Divine truth instructing, regenerating, and protecting.</p><p>[13] As also in Ezekiel:<p>Each cherub had four faces: and each had four wings, their wings were erect one toward the other, each had two wings covering their bodies. I heard the sound of the wings like the sound of great waters, as the voice of Shaddai; when they went, the voice of a tumult like the voice of a camp; when they stood they let down their wings. I heard the voice of their wings kissing each the other, and the voice of wheels beside them; the voice of the wings of the cherubim was heard even unto the court without, as the voice of God Shaddai. The likeness of hands was under their wings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_23.htm">23-24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">3:12-13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_5.htm">10:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_21.htm">21</a>).<p>That "wings" here signify the spiritual Divine, which is the Lord's Divine truth in His celestial kingdom, is evident from the particulars of the description here; that there were "four wings" signifies the spiritual Divine in that kingdom; that "their wings were erect one toward the other," and "kissed each other" signifies consociation and conjunction from the Lord of all in that kingdom; that "the wings covered their bodies" signifies the spiritual Divine there encompassing the celestial Divine; that "the sound of their wings was heard as the sound of great waters," and "as the voice of wheels," and "as the voice of Shaddai," and that "the voice of the wings was heard even unto the court without" signifies the quality of the spiritual Divine, that is, of Divine truths in the ultimate heaven; for "voice" is predicated of truth; "waters" signify truths and the perception of truths; "wheels" the truths of doctrinals, because a "chariot" signifies doctrine; and "God Shaddai" means truth rebuking in temptations, and afterwards consoling; the "court without" is the ultimate heaven; the "likeness of hands under the wings" signifies the power of Divine truth.</p><p>[14] From this also can be seen what the "wings" of the cherubim, that were over the mercy-seat which was upon the ark, signified, which are thus described in Moses:<p>Make one cherub from the one end, and the other cherub from the other end; out of the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof. And the cherubim shall spread out the wings upwards, covering over the mercy-seat with the wings, and their faces shall be a man to his brother; towards the mercy-seat shall be the faces of the cherubim. And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above the ark; and to the ark thou shalt commit the testimony that I shall give thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18-21</a>).<p>Here, too, "cherubim" in like manner signify the Lord's Providence in respect to guarding, that the highest heaven or the celestial kingdom be not approached except through the good of love from the Lord and to the Lord. The "testimony" or the "law," in the ark, signifies the Lord Himself; the "ark" the inmost or the highest heaven; the "mercy-seat" the hearing and reception of all things of worship which are from the good of love, and then expiation; the "wings of the cherubim" signify the spiritual Divine in that heaven or in that kingdom; that "the wings were spread out upwards," and that "they covered the mercy-seat," and that "their faces were toward the mercy-seat" signify the reception itself and hearing. (But all this can be seen more fully explained in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>).</p><p>[15] As most expressions in the Word have a contrary sense also, so do "wings," in which sense they signify falsities and reasonings from them; as in Revelation:<p>Out of the smoke [of the pit of the abyss] went forth locusts. And the voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2-3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_9.htm">9</a>).<p>"Locusts" signify falsities in extremes, and "horses" reasonings from them, and "war" signifies the combat of falsity against truth; it is therefore said, "the voice of the wings of the locusts was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war."</p><p>[16] In Hosea:<p>Ephraim is joined to idols. Their wine is gone; in whoring they have committed whoredom. The wind hath bound her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_17.htm">Hosea 4:17-19</a>).<p>"Ephraim" signifies the intellectual, such as it is with those within the church who are illustrated when they read the Word; "idols" signify the falsities of doctrine; therefore "Ephraim joined to idols" signifies a perverted intellectual seizing upon falsities; that "their wine is gone" signifies that the truth of the church is gone, "wine" meaning that truth; "in whoring they have committed whoredom" signifies that they have falsified truths, "whoredom" meaning the falsification of truth; "the wind hath bound up in its wings" signifies reasonings from fallacies, from which are falsities. (What fallacies in respect to things spiritual are, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_9.htm">Zechariah 5:9</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 283 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>283. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_283/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_4_8" target=_top>8</a>.] "Et quatuor Animalia, singula per se, habebant alas sex in circuitu." Quod significet apparentiam Divini spiritualis undequaque circum Divinum caeleste, constat ex significatione "quatuor Animalium", quae erant cherubi, quod sint custodia et providentia Divina Domini ne adeantur caeli superiores nisi a bono amoris et charitatis; et quia per "quatuor Animalia" quoad corpora hoc significatur, etiam significatur Divinum caeleste (de <sup>1</sup></p><p>quo sequitur): et ex significatione "sex alarum in circuitu", quod sit Divinum spirituale circum illud (de qua etiam sequitur). <p>Quod "cherubi" quoad corpora significaverint Divinum caeleste, et quoad alas Divinum spirituale, est causa, quia omnia per quae repraesentantur caelestia, quoad ipsa corpora significent essentialia, et quoad illa quae circum sunt, significent formalia. Ita quoque homo quoad corpus significat bonum in essentia; et quoad illa quae ambiunt, bonum in forma. Bonum caeleste est bonum in essentia, et bonum spirituale est bonum in forma; et hoc ex causa, quia voluntas, ubi residet bonum, est ipse homo seu homo in essentia, ac intellectus ubi est verum, quod est forma boni, est homo inde, ita homo in forma; hoc bonum etiam circum illud est.<p>[2] Sed primum dicetur quid sit Divinum caeleste, et quid Divinum spirituale. Sunt caeli distincti in duo regna, quorum unum vocatur regnum caeleste, alterum regnum spirituale; distinguuntur in eo, quod illi qui in regno caelesti sunt, in bono amoris in Dominum sint, et illi qui in regno spirituali, in bono charitatis erga proximum sint. Inde Divinum caeleste est bonum amoris in Dominum, et Divinum spirituale est bonum charitatis erga proximum. Secundum haec bona etiam caeli ordinati sunt: supremum seu tertium caelum consistit ex illis qui in bono caelesti seu in bono amoris in Dominum sunt, et caelum quod ei succedit et vocatur caelum medium seu secundum consistit ex illis qui in bono spirituali seu in bono charitatis erga proximum sunt: et quia bonum caeleste est bonum in supremo loco, ac bonum spirituale est bonum in secundo loco, ideo est hoc circum illud; quod enim supra est hoc etiam intra est, et quod infra est hoc etiam extra est, et quod extra est hoc circum est; inde est quod in Verbo per "superiora" et "quae in medio" significentur interiora, et per "inferiora" et "quae in circuitu" intelligantur exteriora. Quia nunc utrumque bonum, caeleste et spirituale, custodit, et per ipsa "Animalia" seu per cherubos quoad corpora significatur Divinum caeleste, et per illos quoad alas significatur Divinum spirituale, patet quod per "quatuor Animalia singula per se visa sint habere alas sex in circuitu", significetur apparentia Divini spiritualis undequaque circum Divinum caeleste. (Sed de his plenior idea haberi potest ex illis quae in opere De Caelo et Inferno dicta et ostensa sunt; primum ex articulo ubi ostenditur, Quod Divinum Domini faciat Caelum, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_283/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_7" target=_top>7-12</a>: dein ex articulo, Quod Divinum Domini in Caelo sit Amor in Ipsum et Charitas erga Proximum, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_283/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_13" target=_top>13-19</a>;

"alae columbae obductae argento" significant vera spiritualia; "pennae flavedine auri" significant bonum spirituale ex quo illa vera; "Schaddai" significat statum tentationum; "reges in ea" significant vera in illo et post illum. <p>Quod "alae columbae obductae argento" significent vera spiritualia, est quia "ala" significat spirituale, "columba" verum ex bono, et "argentum" ipsum verum; quod "pennae obductae flavedine auri" significent bonum spirituale ex quo illa vera, est quia "penna" significat bonum spirituale ex quo vera, et simile "flavedo auri"; quod "cum expandit Schaddai" significet statum tentationum, est quia "Deus Schaddai" significat tentationes et consolationes post illas; et quia vera ex bono implantantur homini per tentationes, ideo dicitur "reges in ea", per "reges" enim significantur vera ex bono (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_283/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_31" target=_top>31</a>).<p>[5] Apud eundem,<p>Deus "equitavit super cherubo, volavit, vectus est super alis venti" (Psalms 18:11 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_283/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_10" target=_top>10</a>]);<p>"Deus equitavit super cherubo", significat Divinam providentiam Domini;

"sub abysso confidere", significat verum scientificum, quod est Divinum spirituale naturale; quia hoc et illud significat verum, et "obtegere" significat custodiam per illud, ideo dicitur, "Clipeus et parma veritas."
