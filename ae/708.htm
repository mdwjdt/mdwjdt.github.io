<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 708</h4><p>708. And the moon under her feet.- That this signifies faith with those who are natural and in charity, is plain from the signification of the moon, as denoting faith in which there is charity, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of feet as meaning things natural, of which see above (n. <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>, <a href="../ae/600.htm">600:1</a>, <a href="../ae/632.htm">632</a>), - here, therefore, those who are natural, because it is said of the woman, who signifies the church, and the sun with which she was encompassed signifies love to the Lord from the Lord and love towards the neighbour, as shown in the preceding article. The woman encompassed with the sun therefore signifies the church with those who are celestial and thence spiritual, and the moon under her feet signifies the church with those who are natural and sensual, and at the same time in the faith of charity; for the goods and thus the truths of heaven and the church have an orderly succession, like the head, the body, and the feet in man. In the head of the Grand Man (Maximus Homo), which is heaven, are those who are in love to the Lord from the Lord, and these are called celestial; but in the body, from the breast even to the loins of that Grand Man, which is heaven, are those who are in love towards the neighbour, and they are called spiritual. But in the feet of the Grand Man, which is heaven, are those who are in the faith of charity obscurely, and these are called natural.</p><p>[2] But in order that this may be clearly apprehended, it must be understood that there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, one called the celestial, and the other the spiritual; also that there are three heavens, the highest called the celestial, the middle called the spiritual, and the lowest the celestial-spiritual-natural.<p>But besides these divisions of the heavens, there is also the further distinction that there are those who receive light, that is, intelligence, from the Lord as a sun, and those who receive light and intelligence from the Lord as a moon. Those who receive the light of intelligence from the Lord as a sun, are those in whom the Intellectual and its Rational have been opened, and who have thence thought rationally concerning things that should be believed from a spiritual affection for truth. But those who receive light from the Lord as a moon, are those in whom the Intellectual and Rational have not been interiorly opened, but only the natural, and who in consequence have thought from the memory about what should be believed; and to think of those things from the memory is to think only about such things as have been heard from a master or preacher, which are called truths, and are also believed to be truths, although they may be falsities, for they are not seen from any further ground. If such had been in the faith of charity during their abode in the world, they, in the heavens, are under the Lord as a moon, for the light (lumen), which is the source of their intelligence, is like the light (lumen) of the moon at night, while the light (lux), which is the source of the intelligence of those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun, is like the light (lux) of day. What the difference is can be seen from the difference between the light of the sun in the day and that of the moon at night. The difference also is such that those who are under the Lord as a moon can see nothing in the light of those who are under the Lord as a sun, because their light (lux) is not genuine, but reflected light, which is capable of receiving falsities as well as truths, provided good appears in the falsities. Since all those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon are natural and sensual, and have nothing in common with those in the heavens who are under the Lord as a sun, and since they also are in falsities, in which, however, there is good, therefore the moon was seen under the feet of the woman, which means the faith of those who are natural.</p><p>[3] So far concerning the faith of those in heaven who are under the Lord as a moon; we will also speak briefly of their affection, from which faith derives its life. Their desire to know truth and do good, is, like themselves, natural, deriving more or less from the glory of learning, and from reputation, which looks to honours and gain as rewards, differing in this from the spiritual desire to know truth and do good, which those have who in heaven are under the Lord as a sun; with these this affection is so separated from natural affection, that the latter is under the feet. This also is the reason why the moon, which signifies not only faith, but also its affection, was here seen under the feet. But a more complete idea of these things may be obtained from what is said and shown in Heaven and Hell under the following heads: "Heaven is divided into two kingdoms" (n. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>); "The Sun and Moon in Heaven," "Light and Heat in the Heavens" (n. <a href="../hh/116.htm">116-140</a>); "The Correspondence of Heaven with all things of Man" (n. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>); also in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, concerning those who are in falsities from good (n. <a href="../njhd/21.htm">21</a>). That the sun signifies the Lord as to Divine Love, and thence love to the Lord from the Lord, and that the moon signifies the truth of faith, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>); moreover, concerning the heavens which are under the Lord as a sun, and those under the Lord as a moon, see also above (n. 411e, 422:3, 527). To this it may be added, that those heavens which are under the Lord as a moon are also three, a higher, a middle, and a lower, or, what is the same, an interior, a middle, and an exterior; still all in these heavens are natural. The reason why they are interior, middle, and exterior, is because the Natural is divided into three degrees in the same manner as the Spiritual; the exterior Natural communicates with the world, the interior with heaven, while the middle is conjunctive. Nevertheless, those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon cannot enter into the heavens that are under the Lord as a sun, because their interior sight or understanding is formed to receive the lunar light there, and not to receive the solar light. They are, comparatively, not unlike those birds that see in the night and not in the day time, consequently when they come into the solar light, which those have who are under the Lord as a sun, their sight is darkened. Those who are in these heavens are such as were in charity according to their religion, or according to their faith; but those who are natural, and not in the faith of charity, are in the hells under those heavens. From these things it is evident that the moon here means faith with those who are natural and in charity; and that the moon was seen under the feet, because those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon have nothing in common with those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun, even to the extent of not being able to ascend up to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 708</h4><p>708. And the moon under her feet, signifies faith with those who are natural and who are in charity. This is evident from the signification of "moon" as being faith in which there is charity (of which presently); and from the signification of "feet," as being things natural (of which above n. <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>, <a href="../ae/600.htm">600</a>, <a href="../ae/632.htm">632</a> <a href="../ae/32.htm">32</a>); here, therefore, those who are natural, because this is said of the "woman," by whom the church is signified, and the "sun" with which she was arrayed, signifies love to the Lord from the Lord and love to the neighbor (as shown in the preceding article); therefore "the woman arrayed with the sun" signifies the church with those who are celestial and thence spiritual, and "the moon under her feet" signifies the church with those who are natural and sensual, and at the same time in the faith of charity; for the goods and the truths therefrom of heaven and the church succeed in order, like the head, the body, and the feet with man. In the head of the Greatest Man, which is heaven, are those who are in love to the Lord from the Lord, and these are called celestial; but in the body, from the breast even to the loins of that Greatest Man, which is heaven, are those who are in love towards the neighbor, and these are called spiritual; but in the feet of the Greatest Man, which is heaven, are those who are obscurely in the faith of charity, and these are called natural.</p><p>[2] But that this may be clearly apprehended it must be known that there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, one called the celestial, and the other the spiritual; and that there are three heavens, the highest called the celestial, the middle called the spiritual, and the lowest called the celestial-natural and the spiritual-natural. Besides these distinctions in the heavens, however, there is the further distinction between those who receive light, that is, intelligence, from the Lord as a sun, and those who receive light and intelligence from the Lord as a moon. Those who receive the light of intelligence from the Lord as a sun are those with whom the intellectual and its rational have been opened, and who have, in consequence, thought rationally about what should be believed from the spiritual affection of truth; while those who receive light from the Lord as a moon are those in whom the intellectual and interior rational have not been opened, but only the natural, and who in consequence have thought from the memory about what should be believed; and to think about this from the memory is to think only from such things as have been heard from a teacher or preacher, which they call truths and believe to be truths although they may be falsities, since they are not seen beyond the memory. If such while in the world were also in the faith of charity, they are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon, for the lumen, from which is their intelligence, is like the moon's lumen in the nighttime, while the light from which is the intelligence of those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun is like the light of day. Of what nature the difference is can be seen from the difference between the light of the sun in the day and the light of the moon in the night. There is the further difference that those who are under the Lord as a moon can see nothing in the light that those have who are under the Lord as a sun, for the reason that their light is not genuine light but a reflected light, which can receive falsities as well as truths if only there seems to be good in the falsities. Because all those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon are natural and sensual, and have nothing in common with those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun, and moreover are in falsities, though in falsities in which there is good, therefore the moon was seen "under the feet" of the woman, which means the faith with those who are natural.</p><p>[3] Thus much respecting the faith of those in heaven who are under the Lord as a moon. A few things shall also be said about their affection, from which faith derives its life. Their affection of knowing truth and doing good is, like themselves, natural, thus deriving more or less from the glory of being learned, and from reputation that looks to honors and gain as rewards, differing in this from such spiritual affection of knowing truth and doing good as those have who are in heaven under the Lord as a sun, for with these this affection is so separated from natural affection that the natural affection is under the feet. This, also, is why "the moon," which signifies not only faith but also its affection, was here seen under the feet. (But a fuller idea of this can be gained from what is said and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, under the heads, Heaven is Divided into Two Kingdoms, n <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>; The Sun and the Moon in Heaven, Light and Heat in the Heavens, n <a href="../hh/116.htm">116-140</a>; and The Correspondence of Heaven with all Things of Man, n. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>; also in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem respecting those who are in falsities from good, n <a href="../njhd/21.htm">21</a>.) That "the sun" signifies the Lord in relation to Divine love, and thus love to the Lord from the Lord, and "the moon" the truth of faith, may be seen above n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>; moreover, respecting the heavens that are under the Lord as a sun, and those under the Lord as a moon, see also above (n. <a href="../ae/411.htm">411</a>, <a href="../ae/422.htm">422</a>, <a href="../ae/527.htm">527</a>). To this is to be added, that there are three heavens that are under the Lord as a moon, a higher, a middle, and a lower; or what is the same, an interior, a middle, and an exterior, but yet all who are in these heavens are natural. These heavens are interior, middle, and exterior, because the natural like the spiritual is divided into three degrees; the exterior-natural communicates with the world, the interior with heaven, and the middle conjoins. Nevertheless, those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon cannot enter into the heavens that are under the Lord as a sun, because their interior sight or understanding has been formed to receive the lunar light there, and not to receive the solar light. They are comparatively not unlike those birds that see in the night and not in the daytime, consequently when they come into the sunlight that those have who are under the Lord as a sun their sight is darkened. Those who are in these heavens are those who have been in charity according to their religious principle, or according to their faith; but such as are natural and are not in the faith of charity are in the hells under these heavens. From this it is evident that the "moon" here means faith with those who are natural and are in charity; and the moon was seen "under the feet" because those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon have nothing in common with those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun, even to the extent that they are unable to rise up to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 708 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>708. "Et luna sub pedibus ejus." - Quod significet fidem apud illos qui naturales sunt, et in charitate, constat ex significatione "lunae", quod sit fides in qua charitas (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "pedum", quod sint naturalia (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69" target=_top>69</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_600" target=_top>600</a> [a] , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_632" target=_top>632</a>), hic itaque naturales, quia dicitur de "muliere", per quam significatur ecclesia; et per "solem" quo circumdata erat, amor in Dominum a Domino, et amor erga proximum (ut in praecedente articulo ostensum est): inde per "mulierem circumdatam sole" significatur ecclesia apud illos qui caelestes et inde spirituales sunt, et per "lunam sub pedibus" significatur ecclesia apud illos qui naturales et sensuales sunt, et simul in fide charitatis; nam bona et inde vera caeli et ecclesiae succedunt ordine, sicut apud hominem caput, corpus et pedes: in capite Maximi Hominis, qui est caelum, sunt illi qui in amore in Dominum a Domino sunt, et hi vocantur caelestes; in corpore autem, a pectore usque ad lumbos Maximi illius Hominis, qui est caelum, sunt illi qui in amore erga proximum sunt, [et] hi vocantur spirituales; at in pedibus Maximi Hominis, qui est caelum, sunt illi qui obscure in fide charitatis sunt, et hi vocantur naturales.<p>[2] Sed ut hoc in clarum intellectum veniat, sciendum est quod duo regna sint in quae caeli distincti sunt, unum quod vocatur caeleste, et alterum quod spirituale; et quod tres caeli sint, supremum quod vocatur caeleste, medium quod spirituale, ac ultimum quod caeleste et spirituale naturale. At praeter has distinctiones caelorum, est quoque distinctio eorum, quod sint qui lucem, hoc est, intelligentiam recipiunt a Domino ut Sole, et sunt qui lucem et intelligentiam recipiunt a Domino ut Luna; illi qui recipiunt lucem intelligentiae a Domino ut Sole, sunt apud quos intellectuale et ejus rationale apertum est, et inde ex affectione veri spirituali rationaliter cogitaverunt de credendis; at qui lucem a Domino ut Luna recipiunt, sunt apud quos intellectuale et rationale interius non apertum est, sed modo naturale, et inde ex memoria cogitaverunt de credendis; et ex memoria de illis cogitare est solum ex talibus quae audiverunt ex magistro vel praedicatore, quae dicunt et quoque credunt vera esse tametsi forent falsa, nam non vident illa ulterius; hi si etiam in fide charitatis in mundo fuerunt, in caelis sub Domino ut Luna sunt; nam lumen, ex quo intelligentia eorum, est sicut lumen Lunae tempore noctis; at lux, ex qua intelligentia eorum qui in caelis sub Domino ut Sole sunt, est sicut lux diei: qualis differentia est, constare potest ex differentia luminum solis interdiu et lunae noctu. Talis etiam est <sup>1</sup></p><p>differentia ut illi qui sub Domino ut Luna sunt nihil videre possint in luce illorum qui sub Domino ut Sole sunt, ex causa quia apud illos non est lux genuina, sed lux reflexa, quae potest recipere falsa, modo in illis appareat bonum, aeque ac vera. Quoniam illi qui in caelis sub Domino ut Luna sunt omnes naturales et sensuales sunt, et non commune habent cum illis qui in caelis sub Domino ut Sole sunt, et quoque illi in falsis sunt in quibus tamen bonum, inde visa est "luna sub pedibus mulieris", et per id intelligitur fides apud illos qui naturales sunt.<p>[3] Haec de fide apud illos qui sub Domino ut Luna in caelo sunt; paucis etiam dicetur de affectione illorum, ex qua fides vitam trahit. Affectio illorum sciendi verum et faciendi bonum est sicut ipsi, naturalis; trahens sic plus aut minus ex gloria eruditionis, et ex fama spectante honores et lucra ut praemia, aliter ac affectio spiritualis sciendi verum et faciendi bonum, qualis est apud illos qui sub Domino ut Sole in caelo sunt; haec affectio apud hos separata est ab affectione naturali, ita ut haec sit sub pedibus; inde quoque est, quod "luna", per quam non solum fides sed etiam affectio ejus significatur, hic visa sit "sub pedibus." (Sed plenior idea de his comparari potest ex illis quae in opere De Caelo et Inferno dicta et ostensa sunt: ut Quod Caelum distinctum sit in duo Regna, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_20" target=_top>20-28</a>; De Sole et de Luna in Caelo, et De Luce et Calore in Caelis, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_116" target=_top>116-140</a>; De Correspondentia Caeli cum omnibus Hominis, n. <sup>2</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_87" target=_top>87-102</a>; et in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de illis qui in falsis sunt ex bono, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_21" target=_top>21</a>.) Quod "sol" significet Dominum quoad Divinum Amorem, et inde Amorem in Dominum a Domino, et quod "luna" verum fidei, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_401" target=_top>401</a>): ac praeterea de caelis qui sub Domino ut Sole, et de caelis qui sub Domino ut Luna, etiam supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411" target=_top>411</a> [c] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_422" target=_top>422</a> [a] , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_708/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_527" target=_top>527</a>). Quibus addendum est quod illi caeli qui sub Domino ut Luna sunt, sint quoque tres, superiores, medii et inferiores, seu quod idem, interiores, medii et exteriores; sed usque omnes in his caelis naturales sunt. Causa quod interiores, medii et exteriores sint, est quia naturale distinguitur in tres gradus, similiter ac spirituale; exterius naturale communicat cum mundo, interius cum caelo, ac medium conjungit; sed usque illi qui in caelis sub Domino ut Luna sunt, non possunt intrare in caelos qui sub Domino ut Sole sunt, quia visus eorum interior seu intellectus formatus est ad recipiendum lucem lunarem ibi, et non ad recipiendum lucem solarem ibi; sunt comparative non absimiles illis avibus quae vident noctu et non interdiu; quare cum in lucem solarem, quae est illis qui sub Domino ut Sole sunt, veniunt, caligatur visus eorum. Sed illi in iis caelis sunt qui in charitate fuerunt secundum religiosum suum, aut secundum fidem suam: at illi qui tales sunt, nempe naturales et non in fide charitatis, in infernis sunt sub illis caelis. Ex his constare potest quod per "lunam" hic intelligatur fides apud illos qui naturales sunt et in charitate; et quod "luna sub pedibus visa sit" quia illi qui in caelis qui sub Domino ut Luna sunt, non commune habent cum illis qui in caelis sub Domino ut Sole sunt, usque ut illi assurgere ad hos nequeant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
