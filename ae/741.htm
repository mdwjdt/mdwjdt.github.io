<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 741</h4><p>741. Which seduceth the whole world.- That this signifies that they pervert all things of the church, is evident from the signification of the whole world, as denoting all things of the church, of which we shall speak presently; and as all things of the church are signified by the whole world, therefore to seduce it signifies to pervert those things. For all things of the church are perverted when the good of charity, which is the good of life, is separated and removed from faith, as not contributing to salvation or having anything to do with it; all things of the Word, and all things of the church are consequently falsified. For the Lord says, that the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments, to love God above all things, and the neighbour as oneself; and these two commandments signify to live and act according to the commandments of the Word; for to love is to will and act, since what a man loves interiorly, this he wills, and what he wills, this he does. The law and the prophets signify all things of the Word.</p><p>[2] There are two principles of evil and falsity into which the church successively falls. The one is the love of having dominion over all things of the church and of heaven, which dominion is meant in the Word by Babel or Babylonia - into this the church falls as a result of evil; the other is the separation of faith from charity, in consequence of which all the good of life perishes; this is meant in the Word by Philistea, and is signified by the he-goat in Daniel, and by the dragon in the Apocalypse; into this the church falls through falsity.<p>But since this chapter treats of the dragon, which primarily signifies the religion of faith separated from charity, I will refer to some of the methods by which the defenders of faith separated [from charity] lead the world astray. They lead the world astray particularly by teaching, that as no one from himself can do good, that in itself is good, and without placing merit therein, therefore good works can contribute nothing to salvation; they nevertheless say that goods ought to be done on account of the public good, and that these are the goods meant in the Word, in preachings therefrom, and in some of the prayers of the church. But how great an error this is shall now be explained. When a man does good from the Word, that is, because it is commanded by the Lord in the Word, he does not then do it from himself, but from the Lord, for the Lord is the Word (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>), and the Lord is in those things which man has from the Word, as He also teaches in these words in John:<p>"He that keepeth my word, I will come unto him, and will make my abode with him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">14:23</a>).<p>This is why the Lord so often teaches that His words and commandments must be done and that those who do them shall have life eternal, also that every one will be judged according to his works. It follows from this that those who do good from the Word do good from the Lord; and good from the Lord is truly good, and so far as it is from the Lord, so far there is no merit in it.</p><p>[3] That good done from the Word, that is from the Lord, is truly good, is also clear from these words in the Apocalypse:<p>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_20.htm">3:20</a>).<p>This shows that the Lord is ever and unceasingly present, and bestows upon man the effort to do good, but that man must open the door, that is, must receive the Lord; and he receives Him when he does good from His Word. Although this appears to man to be done as of himself, yet it is not of man, but of the Lord with him. It has this appearance to man, because he has no other feeling than that he thinks from himself, and acts from himself, although when he thinks and acts from the Word, he does so as of himself, therefore he then also believes that he does this from the Lord.</p><p>[4] From this it can be seen, that the good which a man does from the Word is spiritual good, and that it conjoins man to the Lord and to heaven. But the good which a man does for the sake of the world and for the sake of communities in the world, which is called civil and moral good, conjoins him to the world and not to heaven. Moreover, the conjunction of the truth of faith is with spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour, because faith in itself is spiritual, and what is spiritual cannot be conjoined with any other good than what is equally spiritual. But civil and moral good, separated from spiritual good, is not good in itself, because it is from man, in fact, so far as self and the world lie concealed in it, so far it is evil; this good therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, and if it were conjoined, faith would be dissipated.</p><p>[5] To seduce the whole world signifies to pervert all things of the church, because by world in general is signified the church as to all things pertaining to it, both goods and truths, but specifically it signifies the church as to good; and this is the signification of world (orbem) when earth (terra) also is mentioned. That the earth (terra) in the Word signifies the church, has been shown above (n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>, <a href="../ae/697.htm">697</a>); but when the world (orbis) also is mentioned, then the earth signifies the church as to truth. For there are two things that make the church, namely, truth and good, and these two are signified by earth and world in the following passages.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>"With my soul have I desired thee in the night; with my spirit also in the midst of me have I waited for thee in the morning; for when thou teachest the earth thy judgments, the inhabitants of the world learn justice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2235</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">9857</a>); and that to dwell or inhabit signifies to live, and thence, inhabitants signify those who are in the good of doctrine and thus of life, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/133.htm">133</a>, <a href="../ae/479.htm">479</a>, <a href="../ae/662.htm">662</a>).</p><p>[7] In Lamentations:<p>"The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world believed not that the enemy and the foe would enter into the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>, <a href="../ae/553.htm">553</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>); and that inhabitants signify those who are in good has been shown just above. This makes it clear that the earth signifies the church as to truths, and the world the church as to good. And because all things of the doctrine of the church were destroyed by falsities and evils, it is said that they believed not that the enemy and the foe would enter into the gates of Jerusalem, the enemy signifying the falsities which destroyed the truths of the church, meant by the kings of the earth, and the foe signifying the evils which destroyed the goods of the church, meant by the inhabitants of the world, and Jerusalem signifying the church as to doctrine.</p><p>[8] And in David:<p>"Let all the earth fear Jehovah, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him" (<a href="../ae/275.htm">275:9</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518:23</a>).</p><p>[9] And in Isaiah:<p>"We have conceived, we have travailed, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought salvation in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have [not] fallen" (<a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>); therefore it is said, "Let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof, the world and all its offspring"; for by the earth and the fulness thereof is signified the church as to all truths, and by the world and all its offspring, the church as to all goods.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>"All ye inhabitants of the world and ye dwellers on the earth, when the sign of the mountains shall be lifted up, behold ye; and when the trumpet shall be sounded, hear ye" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_18_3.htm">18:3</a>).<p>By the inhabitants of the world and the dwellers on the earth are signified all in the church who are in goods and truths, as above; the Lord's coming is signified by When the sign of the mountains shall be lifted up, behold ye, and when the trumpet shall be sounded, hear ye, - the sign upon the mountains and the sounding of the trumpet signifying a calling together to the church.</p><p>[11] In David:<p>"Before Jehovah, for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in justice and the peoples in truth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_98_9.htm">Psalm 98:9</a>).<p>This treats of the Lord's coming, and the last judgment at that time. Because the world signifies those of the church who are in good, and peoples those who are in truths, therefore it is said that "he shall judge the world in justice and the peoples in truth"; justice as well as the world refers to good.<p>In the same:<p>"Before the mountains were brought forth, and the earth and the world were formed, from everlasting and even to everlasting, thou art God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_90_2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>).<p>The mountains signify those who dwell upon mountains in the heavens, and these are such as are in celestial good, while the earth and the world signify the church from those who are in truths and in goods.</p><p>[12] In the same:<p>"Jehovah reigneth, he puts on majesty, Jehovah puts on strength, he girdeth himself; the world also shall be established, nor shall it be moved; thy throne is made firm from of old, thou art from eternity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_93_1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_93_2.htm">2</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord who was about to come into the world; and because He has glory and power from the Human which He united to His Divine, it is said that He puts on majesty and strength, and that He girdeth Himself; for the Lord assumed the Human in order that He might have power to subjugate the hells. The church which He was about to establish, and protect for ever, is signified by the world which shall be established, and shall not be moved, and by the throne which shall be made firm; for by the world is signified heaven and the church as to the reception of Divine Good, and by the throne, heaven and the church as to the reception of Divine Truth.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>"Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth; the world also shall be established, neither shall it be moved; he shall judge the peoples in uprightness; the heavens shall be glad and the earth shall rejoice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_11.htm">11</a>).<p>This also is said of the Lord's coming, and concerning the church to be established by Him and protected to eternity, which is signified by the world that shall be established and shall not be moved, as above. And because the world, signifies the church as to good, therefore it is also said concerning the peoples whom He shall judge in uprightness; peoples, like the earth, signify those who are in the truths of the church, therefore they are called peoples of the earth, and inhabitants of the world; uprightness denotes truths. The joy of those who are in the church in the heavens and in the church on earth is signified by The heavens shall be glad and the earth shall rejoice.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>Jehovah "shall judge the world in justice, he shall judge the peoples in uprightness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_9_8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>).<p>Since the world means the church as to good, and "justice" is used in reference to good, therefore it is said, "Jehovah shall judge the world in justice;" and as those who are in truths are called peoples, and uprightness denotes truths as above, therefore it is said, "He shall judge the peoples in uprightness."<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Jehovah maketh the earth by his power, and prepareth the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretcheth out the heavens" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_12.htm">10:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_15.htm">51:15</a>).<p>Jehovah maketh the earth by His power, signifies that the Lord establishes the church by the power of Divine Truth; He prepareth the world by His wisdom, signifies that the church which is in good He forms from Divine Good by means of Divine Truth; By His understanding He stretcheth out the heavens, signifies that thus He enlarges the heavens.</p><p>[15] In David:<p>"The heavens and the earth are thine, the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_11.htm">Psalm 89:11</a>).<p>The heavens and the earth signify the church in the heavens and on earth, each as to truths, while the world and the fulness thereof signifies the church in the heavens and in the earths, each as to goods, fulness denoting goods and truths in their whole extent.<p>Again:<p>"If I should be hungry I would not tell thee, for the world is mine and the fulness thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>).<p>This is said of sacrifices, that the Lord does not delight in them, but in confession and works, for it is added, "Should I eat the flesh of the mighty, or drink the blood of goats? Sacrifice to God confession, and pay thy vows to the Most High" (verses 13, 14). Therefore, if I should be hungry, signifies if I should desire sacrifices; but because the Lord desires worship from goods and truths, it is said, "For the world is mine and the fulness thereof," fulness signifying goods and truths in their whole extent, as above. This is said indeed of the beasts which were sacrificed, but these signify in the spiritual sense various kinds of good and truth.</p><p>[16] In Matthew:<p>"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_14.htm">24:14</a>).<p>Since the world signifies the church as to good, therefore it is said that this Gospel shall be preached unto all nations, for the nations who are to hear and receive signify all those who are in good; moreover, nations also signify all those who are in evils, who also will hear; and then the world signifies the whole church when in evils; therefore it is also said that "then shall the end come."</p><p>[17] In the First Book of Samuel:<p>Jehovah "raiseth up the humbled out of the dust, he raiseth the needy from the dunghill, to cause them to sit with princes, and he shall make them to inherit a throne of glory, for the bases of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them" (<a href="../ae/253.htm">253</a>, <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>).</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>"Jacob shall cause them that are to come to take root, Israel shall blossom and flourish, so that the faces of the world shall be filled with the produce" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_6.htm">27:6</a>).<p>Jacob means the external church, and Israel the internal church; and because the internal of the church is founded upon its externals, and internals are thus multiplied and made fruitful, it is said that "Jacob shall cause them that are to come to take root, and that Israel shall blossom and flourish;" the resulting fructification of the church is signified by The faces of the world shall be filled with the produce.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>"Is this the man that moveth the earth, that maketh kingdoms tremble, that hath turned the world into a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof? Prepare slaughter for his sons, for the iniquity of their fathers, that they rise not up and possess the earth, and the faces of the world be filled with cities" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_16.htm">14:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_21.htm">21</a>).<p>This is said of Lucifer, by whom Babel is meant, that is, the love of ruling over heaven and over the earth; therefore to move the earth, to make kingdoms tremble, to turn the world into a wilderness and destroy the cities thereof, signifies to destroy all things of the church, the earth denoting the church as to truth, kingdoms the churches distinguished according to truths, the world the church as to good, and cities doctrinals. To prepare slaughter for his sons, for the iniquities of their fathers, signifies the destruction of the falsities that arise from their evils. Lest they possess the earth, and fill the faces of the world with cities, signifies lest falsities and evils, and doctrinals from them, take possession of the whole church.</p><p>[20] In the same:<p>"The earth shall mourn and be confounded, the world shall languish and be confounded, they shall languish, the loftiness of the people of the earth, and the earth itself shall be polluted under its inhabitants" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_5.htm">5</a>).<p>This describes the desolation of the church as to its truths and goods, on account of the pride of [man's] own intelligence, and the profanation of truths that are from good. The desolation is described by mourning, being confounded, and languishing; the church as to truths and as to goods is signified by the earth and by the world; the pride of [man's] own intelligence by The loftiness of the people of the earth, and the profanation of truths which are from good, by The earth shall be polluted under its inhabitants.</p><p>[21] In Nahum:<p>"The mountains shall tremble before him, and the hills shall melt; the earth shall be burnt up before him, and the world, and all that dwell therein" (<a href="../ae/400.htm">400:7</a>, <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>). But the earth and the world, and all that dwell therein shall be burnt up, signifies that the church as to all its truths and goods will perish by infernal love.</p><p>[22] In David:<p>"The channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were disclosed, at thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_16.htm">2 Sam. 22:16</a>).<p>That all things of the church as to its truths and goods were overturned from their foundation, is signified by The channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were disclosed, the channels of waters denoting the truths, and the foundations of the world its goods; and to appear and be disclosed denote to be overturned from the foundations. That this destruction arises from the hatred and fury of the evil against Divine things is signified by At Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils; the rebuke and the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah has the same signification as His anger and wrath, elsewhere mentioned in the Word. But because there is no anger or wrath in the Lord against the evil, but the evil cherish these against the Lord, and these appear to them when they perish to be from the Lord, therefore it is put in this way, according to the appearance; the blast of the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah means the east wind, which destroys by drought, and overturns by its penetrating power.</p><p>[23] In the same:<p>"The voice of thunder in the world; the lightnings lightened the world; the earth trembled and shook" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>).<p>"His lightnings shall enlighten the world, the earth shall see and fear, the mountains shall melt like wax before Jehovah, before the Lord of the whole earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_97_4.htm">Psalm 97:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_97_5.htm">5</a>).<p>This describes the state of the wicked on account of the Lord's presence in His Divine Truth, which state is similar to that of the sons of Israel when the Lord appeared to them upon mount Sinai. That they then heard thunders, saw lightnings, and that the mountain appeared in a consuming fire like that of a furnace, and that they feared exceedingly, is known from the Word. This was because they were evil in heart; for the Lord appears to every one according to his quality, to the good as a recreating fire, and to the evil as a consuming fire. This makes evident the signification of The voice of Thy thunder in the world, the lightnings lightened the world, the earth shook and trembled, and the mountains melted before Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth; the world meaning all those of the church who are in goods, but here, those who are in evils, while the earth means all those of the church who are in truths, but here, those who are in falsities.</p><p>[24] In Isaiah:<p>"I will visit upon the world its wickedness, and upon the impious their iniquity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_13_11.htm">13:11</a>).<p>By the world here also are meant those of the church who are in evils, and the impious those who are in falsities. Therefore it is said, I will visit upon the world its wickedness, and upon the impious their iniquity, wickedness denoting evil, while iniquity is said of falsities.</p><p>[25] In Job:<p>"They shall drive him from light into darkness, and chase him out of the world" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_18_18.htm">18:18</a>).<p>Since light signifies truth, and the world the good of the church, and since the impious when they depart from truth into falsity also cast themselves from good into evil, it is therefore, said They shall drive him from light into darkness, and shall chase him out of the world, darkness denoting falsities, and to chase out of the world denoting to cast out from the good of the church.</p><p>[26] In Luke:<p>"Men fainting through fear and for expectation of those things which shall come upon the world; for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken, and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud" of the heavens "with power and much glory" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_26.htm">21:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_27.htm">27</a>).<p>This is said of the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church, when there is no longer any truth, because there is no good; the state of heaven at that time is described by the words, Men shall be faint through fear and expectation of those things which shall come upon the world. This describes the fear of those who are in the heavens, lest everything pertaining to the church as to its good, and thus as to its truths, should perish, and also expectation of help from the Lord, The tottering of the power of Divine Truth is signified by the shaking of the powers of the heavens, the powers of the heavens denoting Divine truths as to power. That the Lord will then make Divine Truth manifest, which possesses power, and from which comes intelligence, is signified by Then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud of the heavens with power and much glory.</p><p>[27] Similar things are signified by the earth and by the world in the following words in the Apocalypse:<p>"They are the spirits of demons doing signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them together to war" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_14.htm">16:14</a>).<p>It is said unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, because one thing of the church is signified by the earth, and another by the world. Since the world signifies the church as to good, therefore it also signifies all things of the church; for good is the essential of the church, consequently, where there is good there also is truth, for all good desires truth, and wishes to be conjoined with truth, and to be spiritually nourished by it; this also is mutual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 741</h4><p>741. That seduceth the whole world, signifies that pervert all things of the church. This is evident from the signification of "the whole world," as being all things of the church (of which presently); and as all things of the church are signified by "the whole world," so "to seduce it" signifies to pervert those things; for all things of the church are perverted when the good of charity, which is the good of life, is separated and removed from faith as not contributing and effecting anything to salvation. Thereby all things of the Word and thence all things of the church are falsified, for the Lord says that the law and the prophets <sup>1</sup>hang on these two commandments, "To love God above all things, and the neighbor as thyself." These two commandments signify to live and act according to the commandments of the Word; for to love is to will and to do, since what a man interiorly loves, that he wills, and what he wills that he does. "The law and the prophets" signify all things of the Word.</p><p>[2] There are two principles of evil and falsity into which the church successively falls. One is dominion over all things of the church and of heaven, which dominion is meant in the Word by "Babel" or "Babylonia;" into this the church falls by reason of evil; the other is the separation of faith from charity, in consequence of which separation all the good of life perishes; this is meant in the Word by "Philistia," and is signified by "the he-goat" in Daniel, and by "the dragon" in Revelation; into this the church falls by reason of falsity. But since this chapter treats of "the dragon," which especially signifies the religion of faith separate from charity, I will mention in passing some things whereby the defenders of faith separate seduce the world. They especially seduce by teaching that as from oneself no one can do good that is in itself good, or can do good without placing merit in it, so good works can contribute nothing to salvation; nevertheless, goods should be done on account of use for the public good; and these are the goods that are meant in the Word and thence in preachings, and in some of the prayers of the church. How great an error this is shall now be told. When a man does good from the Word, that is, because it is commanded by the Lord in the Word, he does it not from himself but from the Lord, for the Lord is the Word (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>), and the Lord is in those things that man has from the Word, as He teaches in these words in John:<p>He that keepeth My word, I will come unto him and will make My abode with him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">John 14:23</a>).<p>This is why the Lord so often commands that His words and commandments must be done; and that those who do them shall have eternal life; so also that everyone will be judged according to his works. From this it then follows that those who do good from the Word do good from the Lord, and good from the Lord is truly good, and so far as it is from the Lord there is no merit in it.</p><p>[3] That good from the Word, thus from the Lord, is truly good, is evident also from these words in Revelation:<p>I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hear My voice and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p>This shows that the Lord is always and continually present and bestows the effort to do good, but that man must open the door, that is, must receive the Lord; and he receives Him when he does good from His Word. Although this appears to man to be done as of himself, yet it is not of man but of the Lord in him. It so appears to man because he has no other feeling than that he thinks from himself and acts from himself; and yet when he thinks and acts from the Word he does it as if of himself, therefore he then also believes that he does it of the Lord.</p><p>[4] From this it can be seen that the good that a man does from the Word is spiritual good, and that this conjoins man to the Lord and to heaven. But the good that a man does for the world's sake and for the sake of the communities in the world, which is called civil and moral good, conjoins him to the world and not to heaven. Moreover, the conjunction of the truth of faith is with spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, because faith in itself is spiritual, and what is spiritual cannot be conjoined with any other good than what is equally spiritual. But civil and moral good, separate from spiritual good, is not good in itself, because it is from man; yea, so far as self and the world lie concealed in it, it is evil; this good, therefore, cannot be conjoined with faith, yea, if it were to be conjoined faith would be dissipated.</p><p>[5] "To seduce the whole world" signifies to pervert all things of the church, because "the world" signifies in general the church as to all things of it, both goods and truths; but in particular it signifies the church in respect to good; this is the signification of "world" when "the earth" also is mentioned. That "the earth" in the Word signifies the church has been shown above (n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>, <a href="../ae/697.htm">697</a>); but when "the world" is also mentioned "the earth" signifies the church in respect to truth. For there are two things that constitute the church, namely, truth and good, and these two are signified by "earth" and "world" in the following passages.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit in the midst of me have I early waited for Thee; for when Thou teachest the earth Thy judgments, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2235</a>) i (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9857</a>) n the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2235</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">9857</a>; and that "to inhabit" signifies to live, and thence "inhabitants" those who are in the good of doctrine and thus of life, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/133.htm">133</a>, <a href="../ae/479.htm">479</a>, <a href="../ae/662.htm">662</a>)</p><p>[7] In Lamentations:<p>The kings of the earth believed not, and all the inhabitants of the world, that the enemy and the adversary would come into the gates of Jerusalem (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>, <a href="../ae/553.htm">553</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>); and that "the inhabitants" signify those who are in good has been shown just above. Thence it is clear that the "earth" signifies the church in respect to truths, and the "world" the church in respect to good. And as all things of the doctrine of the church were destroyed by falsities and evils, it is said that "they believed not that the enemy and the adversary would come into the gates of Jerusalem;" "enemy" signifying the falsities that destroyed the truths of the church, which are meant by "the kings of the earth," and "adversary" signifying the evils that destroyed the goods of the church, which are meant by "the inhabitants of the world;" "Jerusalem" meaning the church in respect to doctrine.</p><p>[8] In David:<p>Let all the earth fear Jehovah, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him (<a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>).</p><p>[9] In Isaiah:<p>We have conceived, we have travailed, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought salvation in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world <sup>2</sup>have fallen <sup>3</sup>(<a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>); therefore it is added, "let the earth hear and the fullness thereof, the world and all its offspring," "the earth and the fullness thereof" signifying the church in respect to all truths, and "the world and all its offspring" the church in respect to all goods.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>All ye inhabitants of the world and ye dwellers on the earth, when the ensign of the mountains shall be lifted up, see ye, and when the trumpet shall be sounded, hear ye (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_18_3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>).<p>"The inhabitants of the world and the dwellers on the earth" signify all in the church who are in goods and truths, as above; the Lord's coming is signified by "when the ensign of the mountains shall be lifted up, see ye, and when the trumpet shall be sounded, hear ye;" "the ensign upon the mountains," as well as "the sounding of the trumpet," signify a calling together to the church.</p><p>[11] In David:<p>Before Jehovah, for He cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in truth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_13.htm">Psalms 96:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_98_9.htm">98:9</a>).<p>This treats of the Lord's coming, and the last judgment at that time. Because the "world" signifies those of the church who are in good, and "peoples" those who are in truths, it is said that "He shall judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in truth;" "righteousness" as well as the "world" refers to good. In the same:<p>Before the mountains were brought forth, and before the earth and the world were formed, from everlasting and even to everlasting Thou art God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_90_2.htm">Psalms 90:2</a>).<p>"Mountains" signify those who dwell upon mountains in the heavens, who are those that are in celestial good, while "the earth and the world" signify the church consisting of those who are in truths and in goods.</p><p>[12] In the same:<p>Jehovah reigneth, He is clothed with majesty, Jehovah is clothed with strength, He girdeth Himself; the world also shall be established, nor shall it be moved; Thy throne is established from then, Thou art from eternity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_93_1.htm">Psalms 93:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_93_2.htm">2</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord when about to come into the world; and as He has glory and power from the Human that He united to His Divine, it is said that "He is clothed with majesty and strength," and that "He girdeth Himself;" for the Lord assumed the Human that He might have power to subjugate the hells. The church that He was about to establish and protect forever is signified by "the world that shall be established and shall not be moved," and "the throne that shall be established;" for the "world" signifies heaven and the church as to the reception of Divine good, and "throne" heaven and the church as to the reception of Divine truth.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth; the world also shall be established, neither shall it be moved; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness; the heavens shall be glad and the earth shall rejoice (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_10.htm">Psalms 96:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_11.htm">11</a>).<p>This, too, is said of the Lord about to come, and of the church to be established by Him and protected to eternity, which is signified by "the world that shall be established and not moved," as above; and as the "world" signifies the church in respect to good it is added that "He shall judge the peoples in uprightness;" the "peoples," like "earth," signify those who are in the truths of the church, therefore it is said "the peoples of the earth," but "the inhabitants of the world;" "uprightness" also means truths. The joy of those who are in the church in the heavens and in the church on earth is signified by "the heavens shall be glad and the earth shall rejoice."</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>Jehovah shall judge the world in righteousness, He shall judge the peoples in uprightness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_9_8.htm">Psalms 9:8</a>).<p>Because the "world" means the church in respect to good, and "righteousness" is predicated of good, it is said "Jehovah shall judge the world in righteousness;" and as those are called "peoples" who are in truths, and "uprightness" means truths, as above, it is said, "He shall judge the peoples in uprightness." In Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah maketh the earth by His power, and prepareth the world by His wisdom, and by His intelligence He stretcheth out the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_15.htm">51:15</a>).<p>"Jehovah maketh the earth by His power" signifies that the Lord establishes the church by the power of Divine truth; "He prepareth the world by His wisdom" signifies that He forms the church that is in good from Divine good by means of Divine truth; "by His intelligence He stretcheth out the heavens" signifies that thus He enlarges the heavens.</p><p>[15] In David:<p>The heavens are Thine and the earth is Thine, the world and the fullness thereof Thou hast founded (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_11.htm">Psalms 89:11</a>).<p>"The heavens and the earth" signify the church in the heavens and in the earths, both in respect to truths, and "the world and the fullness thereof" signifies the church in the heavens and in the earths, both in respect to goods, "fullness" meaning goods and truths in the whole complex. In the same:<p>If I were hungry I would not tell thee, for the world is Mine and the fullness thereof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_12.htm">Psalms 50:12</a>).<p>This is said of sacrifices, that the Lord does not delight in them, but in confession and works, for it is added:<p>Should I eat the flesh of the stout ones, or drink the blood of he-goats? Sacrifice unto God confession, and pay thy vows to the Most High (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_13.htm">Psalms 50:13-14</a>).<p>So "if I should be hungry" signifies if I should desire sacrifices; but as the Lord desires worship from goods and truths it is said "for the world is Mine and the fullness thereof;" "fullness" signifying goods and truths in the whole complex, as above. This is said of the beasts that were sacrificed, but these signify in the spiritual sense various kinds of good and truth.</p><p>[16] In Matthew:<p>These good tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all, and then shall the end come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>).<p>Because the "world" signifies the church in respect to good it is said that "these good tidings shall be preached unto all nations," for the "nations" who are to hear and receive signify all who are in good. Moreover, "nations" signify all who are in evils, who also will hear; but then the "world" signifies the whole church when it is already in evils; therefore it is said that "then shall the end come."</p><p>[17] In the first book of Samuel:<p>Jehovah raiseth up the depressed out of the dust, He exalteth the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with princes, and He shall make them to inherit the throne of glory; for the bases of the earth are Jehovah's, and He hath set the world upon them (<a href="../ae/253.htm">253</a>, <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>)</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>Jacob shall cause them that are to come to take root, Israel shall blossom and bud, so that the faces of the world shall be filled with the increase (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>).<p>"Jacob" means the external church, and "Israel" the internal church; and as the internal of the church is founded upon its externals, and internals are thereby multiplied and made fruitful, it is said that "Jacob shall cause them that are to come to take root, and Israel shall blossom and bud;" the consequent fructification of the church is signified by "the faces of the world shall be filled with the increase."</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>Is this the man that maketh the earth to tremble, that maketh the kingdoms to quake, that hath made the world a wilderness, and thrown down the cities thereof? Prepare slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers, that they rise not up and possess the earth and the faces of the world be filled with cities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_16.htm">Isaiah 14:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_21.htm">21</a>).<p>This is said of Lucifer, by whom "Babylon" is meant, that is, the love of ruling over heaven and over the earth; therefore "to make the earth to tremble, to make the kingdoms to quake, to make the world a wilderness and throw down the cities thereof," signifies to destroy all things of the church; the "earth" meaning the church in respect to truth; "kingdoms," churches distinguished according to truths; the "world" the church in respect to good, and "cities" doctrinals. "To prepare slaughter for the sons for the iniquity of their fathers" signifies the destruction of the falsities that arise from their evils; "that they possess not the earth and fill the faces of the world with cities" signifies lest falsities and evils, and doctrinals from them, take possession of the whole church.</p><p>[20] In the same:<p>The earth shall mourn and be confounded, the world shall languish and be confounded, the exaltation of the people of the earth shall languish, and the earth itself shall be profaned under its inhabitants (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_5.htm">5</a>).<p>This describes the desolation of the church in respect to its truths and goods by reason of the pride of self-intelligence, and the profanation of truths that are from good. The desolation is described by "mourning, being confounded, and languishing;" the church in respect to truths and goods is signified by "the earth and the world;" the pride of self-intelligence by "the exaltation of the people of the earth," and the profanation of truths that are from good by "the earth shall be profaned under its inhabitants."</p><p>[21] In Nahum:<p>The mountains shall quake before Him, and the hills shall melt; the earth shall be burnt up before Him, and the world and all that dwell therein (<a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>, <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>). But "the earth and the world and they that dwell therein shall be burnt up" signifies that the church in respect to all its truths and goods will be destroyed by infernal love.</p><p>[22] In David:<p>The channels of waters appeared and the foundations of the world were revealed at Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the breath of the spirit of Thy nostrils (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_15.htm">Psalms 18:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_22_16.htm">2 Samuel 22:16</a>).<p>That all things of the church in respect to its truths and goods were overturned from the foundation is signified by "the channels of waters appeared and the foundations of the world were revealed;" "the channels of waters" meaning the truths, and "the foundations of the world" its goods, and "to appear" and "to be revealed" meaning to be overturned from the foundation. That this destruction is from the hatred and fury of the evil against Divine things is signified by "at Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the breath of the spirit of Thy nostrils;" the "rebuke" and "the spirit of Jehovah's nostrils" have a similar signification as "His anger and wrath" mentioned elsewhere in the Word. But since the Lord has no anger or wrath against the evil, while the evil have against the Lord, and as anger and wrath appear to the evil when they perish to be from the Lord, therefore this is so said according to that appearance. "The breath of the spirit of Jehovah's nostrils" means also the east wind, which destroys by drought, and overturns by its penetrating power.</p><p>[23] In the same:<p>The voice of Thy thunder is in the world, the lightnings enlightened the world, the earth trembled and quaked (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_18.htm">Psalms 77:18</a>).<p>His lightnings shall enlighten the world; the earth shall see and fear, the mountains shall melt like wax before Jehovah, before the Lord of the whole earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_97_4.htm">Psalms 97:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_97_5.htm">5</a>).<p>This describes the state of the wicked because of the Lord's presence in His Divine truth, which state is like that of the sons of Israel when the Lord appeared to them upon Mount Sinai. That they then heard thunders, saw lightnings, and that the mountain appeared to be in a consuming fire as of a furnace, and they feared exceedingly, is known from the Word. This was because they were evil in heart; for the Lord appears to everyone according to what is his quality, to the good as a recreating fire, and to the evil as a consuming fire. From this it is clear what is signified by "the voice of Thy thunder is in the world, the lightnings enlightened the world, the earth trembled and quaked;" and "the mountains shall melt before Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth;" "the world" meaning all that are of the church who are in goods, but here who are in evils, and the "earth" all that are of the church who are in truths, but here who are in falsities.</p><p>[24] In Isaiah:<p>I will visit malice upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_13_11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>).<p>Here, too, the "world" means those that are of the church who are in evils, and the "wicked" those who are in falsities, therefore it is said "I will visit malice upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity;" "malice" means evil, and "iniquity" is predicated of falsities.</p><p>[25] In Job:<p>They shall thrust him away from light unto darkness, and chase him out of the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_18_18.htm">Job 18:18</a>).<p>Because "light" signifies the truth, and the "world" the good of the church, and when the wicked man casts himself from truth into falsity he also casts himself from good into evil, it is said "they shall thrust him away from light into darkness, and chase him out of the world," "darkness" meaning falsities, and "to chase out of the world" meaning to cast out from the good of the church.</p><p>[26] In Luke:<p>Men will faint for fear and for expectation of the things coming upon the whole world; for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud of the heavens with power and much glory (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_26.htm">Luke 21:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_27.htm">27</a>).<p>This is said of the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church, when there is no longer any truth because there is no good; the state of heaven at that time is described by these words, that "men will faint for fear and for expectation of the things coming upon the whole world;" this describes the fear of those who are in the heavens, that everything of the church in respect to its good and therefore in respect to its truths would perish, and the expectation of help from the Lord. That the power of Divine truth is weakened is signified by "the shaking of the powers of the heavens;" "the powers of the heavens" meaning Divine truths in respect to power; that the Lord will then make evident Divine truth, which has power and from which is intelligence, is signified by "then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud of the heavens, with power and much glory."</p><p>[27] "The earth and the world" have a like signification in the following passage in Revelation:<p>They are the spirits of demons doing signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>).<p>It is said "unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world," because one thing of the church is signified by "earth," and another by "world." As the "world" signifies the church in respect to good it also signifies all things of the church, for good is the essential of the church; therefore where there is good there is also truth, for every good desires truth and wishes to be conjoined to truth and to be spiritually nourished by it, thus also reciprocally.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin has here has "prophet."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "not," as is also found in <a href="../ae/721.htm">721</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;The Latin here has "earth," but in the explanation "world," as in the Hebrew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 741 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>741. "Seducens universum orbem." - Quod significet quae pervertunt omnia ecclesiae, constat ex significatione "universi orbis", quod sint omnia ecclesiae (de qua sequitur); et quia omnia ecclesiae per "universum orbem" significantur, per "seducere illum" significatur pervertere illa; nam pervertuntur omnia ecclesiae quando bonum charitatis, quod est bonum vitae, a fide separatur et removetur sicut nihil conducens et faciens ad salutem; inde falsificantur omnia Verbi, et inde omnia ecclesiae: nam dicitur a Domino, quod Lex et Prophetae pendeant a duobus mandatis, quae sunt amare Deum super omnia, et proximum sicut te ipsum; haec duo mandata significant vivere et facere secundum praecepta Verbi; nam "amare" est velle et facere, quod enim homo interius amat, hoc vult, et quod vult hoc facit: per "Legem et <sup>1</sup></p><p>Prophetas" significantur omnia Verbi.<p>[2] Sunt duo principia mali et falsi in quae ecclesia successive labitur: nempe, in dominium super omnia ecclesiae et caeli, quod dominium in Verbo intelligitur per "Babelem" seu "Babyloniam"; in hoc labitur ecclesia ex malo: altera est separatio fidei a charitate, ex qua separatione omne bonum vitae perit; hoc in Verbo intelligitur per "Philisthaeam", ac significatur per "hircum" apud Danielem, et per "draconem" in Apocalypsi; in hoc labitur ecclesia ex falso. sed quia in hoc capite agitur de "dracone", per quem primario significatur religio fidei separatae a charitate, velim aliqua in medium afferre per quae defensores fidei separatae seducunt orbem. Per hoc imprimis seducunt, quod doceant, <sup>2</sup></p><p>quod, quia nemo potest facere bonum ex se ipso quod in se est bonum, et nisi in eo sit meritum, <sup>3</sup></p><p>quod bona opera nihil ad salutem possint conferre; sed quod usque bona facienda sint propter usus reipublicae, et quod haec bona sint quae intelliguntur in Verbo, et inde in praedicationibus, et in quibusdam precationibus ecclesiae: sed quantum errant, nunc dicetur. Homo non facit bonum a se ipso, sed ex Domino, quando facit bonum ex Verbo, hoc est, quia mandatum est a Domino in Verbo;<p>nam Dominus est Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>),<p>ac Dominus est in illis quae ex Verbo sunt apud hominem, quemadmodum etiam Dominus docet apud Johannem,<p>Qui Verbum meum servat, .... ad illum veniam, et mansionem apud illum faciam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_23" target=_top>14:23</a>).<p>Inde est, quod Dominus toties mandet quod facient verba et praecepta Ipsius, et quod vitam aeternam habituri qui faciunt, tum quod quisque secundum opera judicabitur. Inde nunc sequitur quod qui bonum faciunt ex Verbo bonum faciant ex Domino; et bonum a Domino est Vere bonum, et quantum est a Domino tantum in eo non est meritum.<p>[3] Quod bonum ex Verbo, ita ex Domino, sit vere bonum, etiam constat ex his in Apocalypsi,<p>"Sto ad ostium, et pulso; si quis audiverit vocem meam, et aperuerit ostium, ingrediar ad eum, et cenabo cum eo, et ille Mecum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_20" target=_top>3:20</a>):<p>inde patet quod Dominus jugiter et continue praesens sit, et det conatum faciendi bonum, sed quod homo aperiturus sit ostium, hoc est, recepturus Dominum; et tunc recipit Ipsum quum bonum facit ex Ipsius Verbo. Hoc tametsi homini apparet fieri sicut a se, usque tamen non est hominis, sed Domini apud illum. Quod homini ita appareat, est quia non aliter sentit quam quod cogitet ex se, et faciat ex se, cum tamen dum ex Verbo cogitat et facit, est sicut a se; quare etiam tunc credit quod sit a Domino.<p>[4] Ex his videri potest quod bonum quod homo facit ex Verbo sit bonum spirituale, et quod id conjungat hominem Domino et caelo; at bonum quod homo facit pro mundo et pro societatibus in mundo, quod bonum civile et bonum morale vocatur, conjungit illum mundo et non caelo: et praeterea conjunctio veri fidei est cum bono spirituali, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum, ex causa quia fides in se est spiritualis, ac spirituale non potest cum alio bono conjungi quam quod aeque est spirituale; bonum autem civile et morale, separatum a bono spirituali, non est bonum in se, quia est ab homine; immo quantum sui et mundi in illo latet, tantum est malum; quare hoc non potest conjungi cum fide; immo si conjungeretur, dissiparet fidem<p>[5] Quod "seducere universum orbem" significet pervertere omnia ecclesiae, est quia per "orbem" in genere significatur ecclesia quoad omnia ejus, tam bona quam vera; at in specie significatur ecclesia quoad bonum, et hoc significatur per "orbem" quando etiam "terra" dicitur. Quod per "terram" in Verbo significetur ecclesia, supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_304" target=_top>304</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_697" target=_top>697</a>) ostensum est;

"virtutes caelorum" sunt Divina vera quoad potentiam: quod tunc Dominus manifestaturus sit Divinum Verum, cui potentia, et ex quo intelligentia, significatur per "Tunc videbunt Filium hominis venientem in nube caelorum cum virtute et gloria multa."</p><p>[27] Similia significantur per "terram" et per "orbem" in sequentibus in Apocalypsi,<p>"Sunt.. spiritus daemonum facientes signa ad exeundum ad reges terrae et orbis terrarum totius, ad congregandum illos in bellum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_741/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_14" target=_top>16:14</a>):<p>dicitur, "ad reges terrae et totius orbis terrarum", quia aliud ecclesiae per "terram" et aliud per "orbem" significatur. Quoniam per "orbem" significatur ecclesia quoad bonum, ideo per "orbem" significantur omnia ecclesiae; essentiale enim ecclesiae est bonum; quare ubi est bonum ibi etiam est verum, nam omne bonum desiderat verum, et vult conjungi vero, et ex eo spiritualiter nutriri; ita etiam reciproce.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>3.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>4.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>5.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>6.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>7.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>8.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
