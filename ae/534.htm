<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 534</h4><p>534. And the fifth angel sounded.- That this signifies influx out of heaven manifesting that the state of the church was altogether changed, is evident from the signification of sounding with a trumpet, as denoting influx out of heaven, and a change of the state of the church (see above, n. <a href="../ae/502.htm">502</a>). Here it denotes, that the state of the church was altogether changed, for it was said just above, concerning the three last times in which the angels sounded, "woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound." The change described in that which now follows, is, that all truth was destroyed, and that falsity taking the place of it opened the hells, whence falsities issued forth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 534</h4><p>534. Verse 1 (<a href="../ae/502.htm">502</a>; here that the state of the church was wholly changed, since it was said just above respecting these last three times the angels sounded, "Woe, woe, woe, to those that dwell on the earth, from the remaining voices <sup>1</sup>of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound." The change described in what now follows is that all truth was destroyed, and that the falsity that took its place opened the hells, from which falsities flow forth.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Latin "times," Greek "voices, ' as in all other passages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 534 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>534. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_534/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_9_1" target=_top>1</a>.] "Et quintus angelus clanxit." - Quod significet influxum e caelo manifestantem statum ecclesiae, quod plane immutatus sit, constat ex significatione "clangere tuba, quod sit influxus e caelo, et mutatio status ecclesiae (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_534/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502" target=_top>502</a> [a]); hic quod status ecclesiae plane immutatus sit, quia de tribus his ultimis vicibus, quibus clangerent angeli, mox supra dictum est, "Vae, vae, vae habitantibus super terra ex reliquis <sup>1</sup></p><p>vocibus tubae trium angelorum futurorum clangere." Immutatio quae in nunc sequentibus describitur, est quod omne verum deperditum sit, et quod falsum, quod loco ejus, aperuerit inferna, unde falsa effluunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
