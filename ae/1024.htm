<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1024</h4><p>1024. (Verse 20) And every island fled. That this signifies that there was no longer any truth of faith, is evident from the signification of an island, as denoting the church as to the truths of the natural man, which are called scientific truths, also, the knowledges of good and truth (concerning which see n. 406); in this case the church as to the truths of faith; for the truths that are called truths of faith are the truths of the natural man; and that these are no more is signified by every island fled.<p>The reason why an island denotes the church as to the truths of faith is, that an island is land encompassed by the sea. And by land is signified the church; and by sea the scientific and knowledge in general, which pertains to the natural man.<p>By islands, in the Word, are also signified the churches with the Gentiles, with whom there are only appearances of truth, these being truths more remote from genuine truths. The reason of this signification was, that the islands of the sea were far removed from the land of Canaan, which was the terra firma; by which the church which was in genuine truths was signified.<p>Concerning the Precepts of the Decalogue in general:-</p><p>[2] The precepts of the Decalogue are called the ten words or Ten Precepts, because by ten are signified all; consequently, by the Ten Words are signified all the things of the Word, and therefore all the things of the church, in a summary.<p>The reason why they are all the things of the Word and all the things of the church in summary is, that in each precept there are three interior senses, each sense for its own heaven, for there are three heavens. The first sense is the spiritual-moral sense, this is for the first or ultimate heaven; the second sense is the celestial-spiritual sense, which is for the second or middle heaven; and the third sense is the Divine-celestial, which is for the third or inmost heaven. There are also as many internal senses in everything contained in the Word; for the Word is from the Lord, who is in its supreme things. It was sent down, in order, through the three heavens even to the earth, and thence was accommodated to each heaven; consequently, also the Word is in each heaven, and almost with every angel, in its own sense; it is read by them daily, and there are also preachings from it, just as on the earth.</p><p>[3] For the Word is Divine truth itself, thus Divine wisdom proceeding from the Lord as a Sun and appearing in the heavens as light. The Divine truth is the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit; for it not only proceeds from the Lord, but also enlightens man, and teaches him, as is said concerning the Holy Spirit.<p>Because the Word, in its descent from the Lord, has been accommodated to the three heavens, and the three heavens are conjoined, like inmost things with ultimates by media, thus also the three senses of the Word, it is therefore evident, that the Word was given, in order that the three heavens may be conjoined one with another; and also that there may be a conjunction of the heavens with the human race, for whom the literal sense is given, this being purely natural, and therefore the basis of the other three senses. That the Ten Precepts of the Decalogue are all the things of the Word in a summary can be seen only from those precepts in their three senses, such as above described. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1024</h4><p>1024. Verse 20. And every island fled, signifies that there was no longer any truth of faith. This is evident from the signification of "island," as being the church as to the truths of the natural man, which are called scientific truths [vera scientifica] also cognitions [cognitiones] of truth and good (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/406.htm">406</a>; here it signifies the church as to the truths of faith, for the truths that are called the truths of faith are the truths of the natural man; and that there were no longer these is signified by "every island fled." An "island" means the church as to the truths of faith, the reason is that an island is land encompassed by the sea, and "land" signifies the church, and "sea" the scientific and knowing faculty in general, which belong to the natural man. "Islands" signify also in the Word the churches with the Gentiles that possess nothing but appearances of truth, which are truths further removed from genuine truths. Islands have this signification because the islands of the sea were widely separated from the land of Canaan, which was the mainland, by which the church that was in genuine truths was signified.<p>(The Commandments of the Decalogue in general)</p><p>[2] The commandments of the Decalogue are called the ten words or ten commandments, because "ten" signifies all; consequently the ten words mean all things of the Word, and thus all things of the church in a summary. All things of the Word and all things of the church in a summary are meant, because there are in each commandment three interior senses, each sense for its own heaven, for there are three heavens. The first sense is the spiritual moral sense; this is for the first or lowest heaven; the second sense is the celestial spiritual sense, which is for the second or middle heaven; and the third sense is the Divine celestial, which is for the third or inmost heaven. There are thus three internal senses in every least particular of the Word. For from the Lord who is in things highest, the Word has been sent down in succession through the three heavens even to the earth, and thus has been accommodated to each heaven; and therefore the Word is with each heaven and almost with each angel in its own sense, and is read by them daily; and there are preachings from it, as on the earth.</p><p>[3] For the Word is Divine truth itself, thus the Divine wisdom, proceeding from the Lord as a sun, and appearing in the heavens as light. Divine truth is the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit, for it not only proceeds from the Lord but it also enlightens man and teaches him, as is said of the Holy Spirit. As the Word in its descent from the Lord has been accommodated to the three heavens, and the three heavens are joined together as inmosts are with ultimates through intermediates, so, too, are the three senses of the Word; which shows that the Word is given that by it there may be a conjunction of the heavens with each other, and also a conjunction of the heavens with the human race, for whom the sense of the letter is given, which is merely natural and thus the basis of the other three senses. That the ten commandments of the Decalogue are all things of the Word in a summary can be seen only from the three senses of those commandments, which are as above stated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1024 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1024. (Vers. 20.) "Et omnis insula fugit." - Quod significet quod amplius non aliquod verum fidei esset, constat ex significatione "insulae", quod sit ecclesia quoad vera naturalis hominis, quae vera scientifica, tum cognitiones veri et boni, vocantur (de qua (supra), n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1024/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_406" target=_top>406</a>); hic ecclesia quoad vera fidei, nam vera quae vocantur fidei sunt vera naturalis hominis; quod illa non amplius sint, significatur per quod "omnis insula fugit." Quod "insula" sit ecclesia quoad vera fidei, est quia insula est terra circumdata mari, et per "terram" significatur ecclesia, et per "mare" scientificum et cognitivum in communi, quod est naturalis hominis. Per "insulas" in Verbo etiam significantur ecclesiae apud gentes, apud quas modo apparentiae veri fuerunt, quae sunt vera remotiora a veris genuinis. Causa hujus significationis fuit, quia insulae maris elongatae erant a terra Canaane, quae erat terra firma, per quam ecclesia, quae in genuinis veris erat, significabatur.<p>[2] DE PRAECEPTIS DECALOGI IN GENERE.<p>Quod praecepta decalogi dicta sint "Decem Verba" seu "Decem Praecepta", est quia per "decem" significantur omnia, consequenter per "decem verba" significantur omnia Verbi et inde omnia ecclesiae in summa. Quod sint omnia Verbi et omnia ecclesiae in summa, est quia singulis praeceptis ibi tres interiores sensus insunt, quilibet sensus pro suo caelo, nam tres caeli sunt. Primus sensus est sensus spiritualis moralis, hic est pro primo seu ultimo caelo; secundus sensus est sensus caelestis spiritualis, qui est pro secundo seu medio caelo; et tertius sensus est Divinus caelestis, qui est pro tertio seu intimo caelo. Tot sensus interni sunt quoque in singulis Verbi; nam Verbum est a Domino, qui in supremis est, per tres caelos usque ad terram ordine demissum, et inde unicuivis caelo accommodatum factum; quare etiam Verbum est in unoquovis caelo, et paene apud unumquemvis angelum, in suo sensu, et ab illis legitur cottidie, et quoque ex illo praedicationes fiunt, sicut in terris.<p>[3] Nam Verbum est ipsum Divinum Verum, ita Divina Sapientia, procedens a Domino ut Sole, et apparens in caelis ut lux; Divinum Verum est id Divinum, quod vocatur Spiritus sanctus; id enim non modo procedit a Domino, sed etiam illustrat hominem, et docet illum, sicut de Spiritu sancto dicitur. Quoniam Verbum in descensu a Domino accommodatum factum est tribus caelis, et tres caeli conjuncti sunt sicut intima per media cum ultimis, ita quoque tres sensus Verbi, inde patet quod Verbum datum sit ut per illud conjunctio sit caelorum inter se, et quoque ut conjunctio sit caelorum cum genere humano, pro quo est sensus litterae, qui est mere naturalis, et inde basis reliquorum trium sensuum. Quod decem praecepta decalogi sint omnia Verbi in summa, non aliunde constare potest quam ex praeceptis illis quoad tres suos sensus, qui tales sunt. </p>
