<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 930</h4><p>930. Verses 2-4. And I saw as it were a glassy sea, mingled with fire; and them that have victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, standing near the glassy sea, having harps of God. And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God; and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who does not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; wherefore all nations shall come, and adore before thee; for thy judgments have been made manifest.<p>"And I saw as it were a glassy sea, mingled with fire," signifies the generals of truth from the Word pellucent from spiritual truths that are from the good of love; "and them that have victory over the beast," signifies, who have lived a life of charity, and consequently have not falsified the Word; "and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name," signifies, and who have not acknowledged the doctrine of faith separated from charity, nor anything characterising it; "standing near the glassy sea," signifies, because they were in truths from the Word; "having harps of God," signifies the glorification of the Lord from spiritual affection.<p>"And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God; and the song of the Lamb," signifies acknowledgment and confession of the precepts in the Word of both Testaments, also the acknowledgment and confession of the Divine of the Lord in His Human; "saying, Great and wonderful are thy works," signifies, that all the goods of heaven and the church are from Him; "Lord God Almighty," signifies because He is Divine Good; "just and true are thy ways," signifies that all the truths of heaven and the church are from Him; "Thou King of saints," signifies because He is Divine truth.<p>"Who does not fear thee, O Lord," signifies the worship of the Lord from the good of love; "and glorify thy name," signifies the worship of Him from truths from that good; "for thou only art holy," signifies, because He is Good and Truth itself, and hence all good and all truth are from Him; "wherefore all nations shall come and adore before thee," signifies, that all those who are in the good of love, and thence in truths, will acknowledge His Divine; "because thy judgments have been made manifest," signifies that Divine truths are revealed to them. </p>
