<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 590</h4><p>590. Nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications.- That this signifies, from perverting good and falsifying truth, is evident from the signification of sorceries, as denoting the perversions of good, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of fornications, as denoting the falsifications of truth (see above, n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../ae/161.htm">161</a>). That sorceries, in the spiritual sense, signify perversions of good, is evident from this fact, that mention at the same time is made of fornications, and fornications signify the falsifications of truth; and, in the Word, when truth is the subject, good is also treated of, because there is a celestial Divine marriage in every part of it. It is also said, that they repented not of their murders, sorceries, and fornications; and murders signify the extinction of the affection for good, which belongs to the will, and of the perception of truth, which belongs to the understanding (see above, n. <a href="../ae/589.htm">589</a>). And the affection for good, which belongs to the will, is extinguished, when the good of the Word is perverted; and the perception of truth, which belongs to the understanding, when the truth of the Word is falsified. The signification of sorceries is therefore clear.</p><p>[2] In ancient times, various kinds of infernal arts, called magic, were in use, some of which are spoken of in the Word (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_18_9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a>). Among these there were also enchantments, by means of which they called forth affections and pleasures which another could not resist. This was effected by sounds and tacit expressions, which they either brought forth or muttered, and which, by analogous correspondences, had communication with the will of another, and excited his affection, and fascinated him to will, think, and act in a certain manner. The prophets were skilled in and also used such enchantments, by means of which they excited good affections, hearkening, and obedience; these enchantments are mentioned in a good sense in the Word in Isaiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_26_16.htm">26:16</a>); Jeremiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_17.htm">8:17</a>); and in David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_58_4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_58_5.htm">5</a>). But because evil affections were excited by the evil by means of such speeches and mutterings, and thus enchantments became magical, therefore they are also spoken of as among the magical arts, and were strictly prohibited (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_18_9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_18_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_18_11.htm">11</a>; Isaiah 67:9, 12; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_23.htm">Apoc. 18:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_15.htm">22:15</a>). <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The following note occurs in the photo-lithograph copy:- De Bileamo, de Jesabele, concerning Balaam, concerning Jezebel. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 590</h4><p>590. Nor of their enchantments, nor of their whoredoms, signifies nor from perverting good and falsifying truth. This is evident from the signification of "enchantments," as being the perversions of good (of which presently); and from the signification of "whoredoms," as being falsifications of truth (See above, n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../ae/161.htm">161</a>). That "enchantments" signify in the spiritual sense the perversions of good can be seen from this, that they are mentioned in connection with "whoredoms," and "whoredoms" signify the falsifications of truth; and wherever in the Word truth is treated of, good is also treated of, because of the Divine celestial marriage in every particular of it. Moreover, it is "repenting of murders, enchantments, and whoredoms," that is spoken of, and "murders" signify the extinction of the affection of good which is of the will, and of the perception of truth which is of the understanding (See above, n. <a href="../ae/589.htm">589</a>); and the affection of good which is of the will is extinguished when the good of the Word is perverted, while the perception of truth which is of the understanding is extinguished when the truth of the Word is falsified; this also makes evident what is here signified by "enchantments."</p><p>[2] In ancient times there were many kinds of infernal arts, called magic, which were in use; some of these are enumerated in the Word (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_18_9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a>); among these were also "enchantments," by which they induced affections and pleasures that another could not resist; this was done by sounds or muttered words, which they brought forth or muttered; and these by analogous correspondences had communication with another's will and excited his affection, and fascinated him into willing, thinking, and acting in a particular way. Such enchantments the prophets also were skilled in and employed, and by them they excited good affections, hearkening, and obedience; and these enchantments are mentioned in a good sense in the Word in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_26_16.htm">26:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>; and in David, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_58_4.htm">Psalms 58:4-5</a>. But as the evil excited evil affections by such utterances and mutterings, and thus enchantments became magical, they are also enumerated among the magical arts and severely forbidden (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_18_9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_47_9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_47_12.htm">12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_15.htm">22:15</a>.

"Neque ex incantationibus suis, neque ex scortationibus suis." - Quod significet a pervertendo bonum et a falsificando verum, constat ex significatione "incantationum", quod sint perversiones boni (de qua sequitur), et ex significatione "scortationum", quod sint falsificationes veri (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_141" target=_top>141</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_161" target=_top>161</a>). <p>Quod "incantationes" in sensu spirituali significent perversiones boni, constare potest ex eo, quod conjunctim dicantur cum scortationibus, et "scortationes" significant falsificationes veri; ac in Verbo ubi dicitur de vero, etiam dicitur de bono, ob conjugium Divinum caeleste in singulis ejus: et quoque dicitur "paenitentiam agere ab homicidiis, incantationibus et scortationibus"; et per "homicidia" significantur exstinctiones affectionis boni quae voluntatis et perceptionis veri quae intellectus (videatur mox supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_589" target=_top>589</a>), et affectio boni quae voluntatis exstinguitur dum pervertitur bonum Verbi, ac perceptio veri quae intellectus dum falsificatur verum Verbi; inde etiam constare potest quid hic per "incantationes" significatur.<p>[2] Antiquis temporibus plura genera artium infernalium, quae magiae vocantur, in usu fuerunt, quarum aliquae recensentur in Verbo (ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_18_9-11" target=_top>Deuteronomius 18:9-11</a>); inter illas etiam fuerunt incantationes, per quas inducebant affectiones et voluptates quibus alter non potuit resistere, quod fiebat per sonos et tacitas voces, quas vel producebant vel mussitabant; quae per correspondentias analogas communicationem habebant cum voluntate alterius, et excitabant ejus affectionem, et fascinabant ad ita et non aliter volendum, cogitandum et faciendum. Tales incantationes etiam callebant prophetae, et quoque faciebant, et per illas excitabant affectiones bona";, auscultationem et obedientiam, quae incantationes in bono sensu nominantur in Verbo Apud Esaiam, cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_3_1-3" target=_top>3:1-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_3_20" target=_top>20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_26_16" target=_top>26:16</a>: apud Jeremiam, cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_17" target=_top>8:17</a>: et apud Davidem, in Psalms 58:5, 6 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_58_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_58_5" target=_top>5</a>] . Sed quia per tales loquelas et mussitationes a malis excitabantur affectiones malae, et sic incantationes factae sunt magicae, ideo inter artes magicas etiam recensentur, et Severe prohibentur (Ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_18_9-11" target=_top>Deuteronomius 18:9-11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_47_9" target=_top>Esaias 47:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_47_12" target=_top>12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_23" target=_top>Apocalypsis 18:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_590/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_15" target=_top>22:15</a> *}). </p>
