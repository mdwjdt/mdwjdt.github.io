<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 92</h4><p>92. CHAPTER 2.<p>1. UNTO the angel of the Ephesian church write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;<p>2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy endurance, and that thou canst not bear them that are evil; and hast explored them that say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars;<p>3. And hast borne, and hast endurance, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<p>4. But, I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first charity.<p>5. Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy lampstand out of its place except thou repent.<p>6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.<p>7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches: To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God.<p>8. And unto the angel of the church of the Smyrnaeans write: These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive.<p>9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty (but thou art rich), and I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.<p>10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.<p>11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches: he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.<p>12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword.<p>13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in the days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.<p>14. But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.<p>15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.<p>16. Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.<p>17. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches: To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna; and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth.<p>18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like burnished brass:<p>19. I know thy works, and charity, and ministry, and faith, and thy endurance, and thy works; and the last to be more than the former.<p><a href="../ae/20.htm">20</a>. But I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants to commit whoredom and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.<p>21. And I gave her time to repent of her whoredom; and she repented not.<p>22. Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great affliction, except they repent of their deeds.<p>23. And I will kill her sons with death. And all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to his works.<p>24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I put upon you none other burden.<p>25. Nevertheless, that which ye have, hold fast till I come.<p>26. And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations;<p>27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as earthen vessels shall they be broken in pieces, even as I received of my Father.<p>28. And I will give him the morning star.<p>29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<p>IN the preceding pages it has been explained what is meant by the seven churches, and by the angels thereof, which is as follows:- the seven churches mean all those who are in truths from good; and the seven angels, all those who correspond to them in heaven (as may be seen, n. 20 and <a href="../ae/90.htm">90</a>). And because heaven and the church make one, by correspondence, therefore it is said in what follows, "Write to the angel of the church," and not, "Write to the church." The reason why it is thus said, is also that there must be correspondence, in order that the church may be the church with man; for if there were not correspondence, there would be no communication with heaven, thus heaven would not be with man; and if heaven were not with him, the church would not be with him (as may be seen in the work, <a href="../njhd/241.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 241-248</a>. What the correspondence of the man of the church with heaven is, cannot be stated in a few words; but he who desires to know it, may be instructed on the subject from the things said and shown in the work, <a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-115</a> <a href="../hh/291.htm">291-310</a>). In a word, there is correspondence when man is made spiritual, and man becomes spiritual when he acknowledges that which is Divine, and specifically the Lord, and loves to live according to the precepts contained in the Word; for when he does this, he is conjoined with heaven and then the Spiritual corresponds with his Natural. I know, however, that these things will seem to many to be beyond their apprehension; but the reason is, that it is not the delight of their love to know them; for if it were, they would not only see them clearly, but would also desire to know more of such things; for what a man loves he desires, and what he loves is his delight; whatever also is loved, enters with joy, and at the same time with light, into the idea of the mind. </p>

So thou also hast then that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.<p>16. Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against thee with the sword or My mouth.<p>17. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

It is so said for this reason also, that there must be correspondence in order that the church may be a church with man; if there were no correspondence, there would be no communication of heaven, thus no heaven, with man; and if heaven were not with him neither would the church be with him. (See <a href="../njhd/241.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 241-248</a>. What the correspondence of the man of the church with heaven is, cannot be told in a few words, but whoever desires may be taught what it is in what is said and shown in the work on <a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-115</a> <a href="../hh/291.htm">291-310</a>.) In a word, there is correspondence when man has becomes spiritual, and man becomes spiritual when he acknowledges the Divine and especially the Lord, and loves to live according to the precepts in the Word, for when he does this he is conjoined with heaven; and then the spiritual corresponds with the natural which is with him. I am aware that to many these things may seem to exceed their comprehension; but the reason is that it is not the delight of their love to know them; if it were the delight of their love, not only would they perceive them clearly, but they would also be eager to, know much more of such things; for a man desires what he loves, and what he loves is his delight; moreover, whatever is loved enters both with joy and with light into the idea of the mind.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"But thou art rich," is crossed out by the author, but is found in n. <a href="../ae/118.htm">118</a> below.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 92 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>92. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_1-29" target=_top>CAPUT II</a>.<p>1. ANGELO Ephesinae Ecclesiae scribe: Haec dicit tenens septem stellas in dextra sua, ambulans in medio septem candelabrorum aureorum.<p>2. NOVI opera tua, et laborem tuum, et tolerantiam tuam, et quod non possis ferre malos, et exploraveris dicentes se esse apostolos, et non sunt, et inveneris eos mendaces.<p>3. Et sustinuisti, et tolerantiam habes, et propter nomen meum laborasti, et non defecisti.<p>4. Sed habeo adversus te, quod charitatem tuam primam reliqueris.<p>5. Memor esto itaque unde excideris, et resipisce, et prima opera fac; sin minus, veniam tibi cito, et movebo candelabrum tuum de loco suo, si non resipueris.<p>6. Sed hoc habes, quod odisti opera Nicolaitarum, quae et Ego odi.<p>7. Habens aurem audiat quid Spiritus dicit ecclesiis: vincenti dabo illi edere de arbore vitae, quae iri medio paradisi Dei.<p>8. Et Angelo Ecclesiae Smyrnaeorum scribe: Haec dicit Primus et Ultimus, qui fuit mortuus et vivit.<p>9. Novi tua Opera, et afflictionem, et paupertatem, <sup>1</sup></p><p>dives sed es, et blasphemiam dicentium Judaeos esse se et non sunt, sed synagoga satanae.<p>10. Nihil timeas quae futurus es pati; ecce futurum ut conjiciat ex vobis diabolus in custodiam, ut tentemini, et habebitis afflictionem diebus decem: esto fidelis usque ad mortem, et dabo tibi coronam vitae.<p>11. Habens aurem audiat quid Spiritus dicit ecclesiis; vincens non laedetur a morte secunda.<p>12. Et Angelo in Pergamo Ecclesiae scribe: Haec dicit habens romphaeam ancipitem acutam.<p>13. Novi opera tua, et ubi habitas, ubi thronus satanae; et tenes nomen meum, et non negasti fidem meam, et in diebus in quibus Antipas martyr meus fidelis, qui Occisus apud vos, ubi habitat satanas.<p>14. Sed habeo adversus te pauca, quod habeas illic tenentes doctrinam Balaam, qui docebat Balacum objicere scandalum coram filiis Israelis, edere idolothyta et scortari.<p>15. Ita habes et tu tenentes doctrinam Nicolaitarum, quod odi.<p>16. Resipisce; sin minus, veniam tibi cito, et pugnabo cum illis romphaea oris mei.<p>17. Habens aurem audiat quid Spiritus dicit ecclesiis: vincenti dabo illi edere de manna abscondito; et dabo illi calculum album, et in calculo nomen novum scriptum, quod nemo novit nisi qui accipit.<p>18. Et Angelo in Thyatiris Ecclesiae scribe: Haec dicit Filius Dei habens oculos suos tanquam flammam ignis, et pedes suos similes chalcolibano.<p>19. Novi tua opera et charitatem, et ministerium et fidem, et tolerantiam tuam et opera tua, et ultima plura prioribus.<p>20. Sed habeo adversus te pauca, quod permittas mulierem Jezabel, dicentem se prophetissam, docere et seducere meos servos scortari et idolothyta edere.<p>21. Et dedi illi tempus ut resipisceret a scortatione sua, et non resipuit.<p>22. Ecce Ego conjicio illam in lectum, et moechantes cum illa in afflictionem magnam, si non resipuerint ab operibus suis.<p>23. Et filios ejus occidam morte, et cognoscent omnes ecclesiae quod Ego sim scrutans renes et corda; et dabo unicuique vestrum secundum opera sua.<p>24. Vobis autem dico, et reliquis in Thyatiris, quicunque non habent doctrinam hanc, et qui non cognoverunt profunda satanae, sicut dicunt; non impono super vos aliud onus.<p>25. Attamen quod habetis retinete donec venio.<p>26. Et vincens et custodiens usque ad finem opera mea, dabo illi potestatem super gentes.<p>27. Et reget eas virga ferrea, tanquam vasa fictilia confringentur; sicut et Ego accepi a Patre meo.<p>28. Et dabo illi stellam matutinam.<p>29. Habens aurem audiat quid Spiritus dicit ecclesiis.<p>In praecedentibus dictum est quid per "septem ecclesias" et per "angelos" earum intelligitur; quod nempe per "septem ecclesias" omnes qui in veris ex bono sunt, et per "septem angelos" omnes qui illis correspondent in caelo (videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_20" target=_top>20</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90" target=_top>90</a>); et quia caelum et ecclesia per correspondentiam unum faciunt, ideo dicitur in sequentibus, "Scribe Angelo Ecclesiae", et non Scribe Ecclesiae. Causa quod ita dicatur etiam est quia correspondentia erit, ut ecclesia sit ecclesia apud hominem; si non correspondentia esset, non foret communicatio caeli, ita non caelum apud illum; et si non caelum, nec foret ecclesia apud illum. <p>(Videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_241" target=_top>241-248</a>. Quid correspondentia hominis ecclesiae cum caelo, non paucis dici potest; sed qui vult, instrui potest quid sit ex illis quae in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_87" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 87-115</a>, et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_291" target=_top>291-310</a>, dicta et ostensa sunt.) <p>In summa, est correspondentia quando homo spiritualis factus est; et homo spiritualis fit quando agnoscit Divinum, et in specie Dominum, et amat vivere secundum praecepta in Verbo, nam cum hoc facit, conjungitur caelo; et tunc correspondet spirituale cum naturali quod apud illum. Sed scio quod haec pluribus videantur captum eorum excedere; verum causa est quia non est jucundum amoris illorum illa scire; si id foret jucundum amoris eorum, non solum illa clare perciperent, sed etiam multo plura desiderarent scire; hoc enim desiderat homo quod amat, et quod amat hoc jucundum ejus est; quicquid etiam amatur, hoc intrat cum gaudio et simul cum luce in mentis ideam.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
