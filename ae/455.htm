<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 455</h4><p>455. And peoples, and tongues.- That this signifies all those who are in falsities from ignorance and from various religions, is evident from the signification of peoples, as denoting those who are in truths of doctrine, and in the opposite sense, those who are in falsities of doctrine, concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>); but in the present case, those who are in falsities of doctrine from ignorance; here those who are saved, although they have been in falsities from the doctrine of their religion, are treated of; for all those are saved who are in the good of life according to the tenets of their religion, which they have believed to be truths, although they are not truths, since falsity is not imputed to any one who lives well according to the tenets of his religion, because it is no fault of his that he does not know truths; for the good of life according to religion contains within itself the affection of knowing truths, and these such persons also learn and receive when they come into another life, because every affection remains with man after death, and especially the affection of knowing truths, since this is a spiritual affection; and a man, when he becomes a spirit, is his own affection, and therefore, the truths which they desire they then drink in, and thus they receive them deeply into their hearts; (That the falsities of religion, if a man lives well, are accepted by the Lord as truths, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/452.htm">452</a>); and from the signification of tongues, which denote their confessions from religion, for by tongues are meant speech, and speech signifies confession and religion, because the tongue utters and confesses those things that belong to religion.</p><p>[2] In the Word, the lip, mouth, and tongue are frequently mentioned; and the lip signifies doctrine, the mouth thought, and the tongue confession. The reason of these significations is that the lip, the mouth, and the tongue, are the external organs of man, by which internal things are made manifest, and internal things are those signified in the internal or spiritual sense. For the Word in the letter consists of exterior things, which appear before the eyes, and are perceived by the senses; for this reason the Word in the letter is natural, and this is the case in order that the Divine Truth which it contains may be there in its ultimate, and so in its fulness; but those external natural things, comprehend in themselves internal spiritual things, which are therefore the things signified.</p><p>[3] That tongues signify confessions from religion, and according to the tenets of religion, is evident from the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"The time will come for gathering together all nations and tongues, that they may come and see my glory" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">66:18</a>).<p>This is said of the coming of the Lord. Nations and tongues signify all who are in the good of life according to their religions; tongues signify religions from confession; therefore it is said, "That they may come and see my glory," glory signifying Divine Truth, by which the church exists.</p><p>[4] In Daniel:<p>"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of the heavens; and there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and tongues, should serve him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_14.htm">14</a>).<p>That the Son of man, who was to come in the clouds of heaven, means the Lord, is evident. The clouds of the heavens mean the Word in the letter, in which it is said that the Lord will come, because the Word treats of Him, and in its inmost sense of Him alone. For this reason it is said "the Son of man," for the Lord is called "the Son of man" from Divine Truth, which is the Word. But more may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_7.htm">1:7</a>). The Lord's power from Divine Good is meant by dominion, and from Divine Truth, by glory, while heaven and the church are meant by a kingdom. People, tongues, and nations, signify all those who are in doctrine and in a life according to their religion. Those who are in doctrine are called peoples; those who are in life, nations; while tongues denote religions.</p><p> [5] In Zechariah:<p>"In those days ten men out of all tongues of the nations, shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you" (<a href="../ae/433.htm">433:26</a>). A Jew means those who are in love to the Lord and in truths of doctrine from Him; and by all tongues of the nations are meant those who are of various religions.</p><p>[6] Similar things are signified by tongues in the following passages.<p>In Moses:<p>"From these were dispersed the isles of the nations in their lands, every one according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations." The habitations of the sons "of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_31.htm">31</a>).<p>In the Apocalypse:<p>"Thou must prophesy again over peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_10_11.htm">10:11</a>).<p>And again:<p>"And from among the peoples, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall they see their dead bodies three days and a half" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_11_9.htm">11:9</a>).<p>And again:<p>"And it was given unto" the beast" to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_7.htm">13:7</a>).<p>Again:<p>"I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_6.htm">14:6</a>).<p>And again:<p>"The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_15.htm">17:15</a>).<p>Waters here signify the truths of the Word, for waters in the Word denote truths, and, in the opposite sense, falsities. Therefore, by peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues, are here meant those who are in truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and thence in evils of life.</p><p>[7] So in Luke:<p>The rich man said to Abraham, "Have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_24.htm">16:24</a>).<p>In this parable, as well as in the rest, the Lord spoke by correspondences, as is evident from this, that the rich man does not mean the rich, neither does Abraham mean Abraham. The water with which Lazarus might cool the rich man's tongue does not mean water, and neither does "tongue" mean the tongue, nor does "flame" mean flame, for in hell no one is tormented by flames. But by the rich man are meant those who are of the church where the Word is, out of which they have spiritual riches, which are truths of doctrine. Therefore by the rich man are there meant the Jews, who were then in possession of the Word; by Abraham is meant the Lord; by the water into which Lazarus might dip the tip of his finger, is signified truth from the Word; by the tongue, thirst and eager desire to pervert the truths of the Word; and by flame, the various and manifold punishment of that eager desire. Hence the signification of those words in a series is evident; and that by cooling the tongue with water is signified to allay the thirst and eager desire to pervert truths, and by means of them to confirm falsities. Who cannot see that it is not meant that Lazarus should dip the tip of his finger in water to cool the tongue?</p><p>[8] Again in Zechariah:<p>"This shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that shall fight against Jerusalem; the flesh of every one shall consume away while he stands upon his feet, and his eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and his tongue shall consume away in his mouth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">14:12</a>).<p>These things are spoken of those who endeavour to destroy the truths of doctrine by falsities; this is signified by fighting against Jerusalem, for Jerusalem signifies the church as to doctrine, and thence the truths of the doctrine of the church. By the flesh consuming away is signified that all the good of love and of life would perish, for this is signified by flesh. By standing upon their feet, is meant upon bones without flesh, which signifies that they would become altogether corporeal-natural, for the feet signify those things which pertain to the natural man, and in the present case, its lowest things. By their eyes consuming away in their sockets, is signified that all the understanding of truth would perish, for the eyes signify the understanding. By his tongue consuming away in the mouth is signified that all perception of truth and affection for good would perish. The tongue also signifies perception of truth and affection for good; perception of truth from the fact that it speaks, and affection for good, from the fact that it tastes, for taste signifies appetite, desire, and affection.</p><p>[9] In the book of Judges:<p>"Jehovah said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the waters with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. And the number of them that lapped in their hand, was three hundred men. These were led against Midian, and smote him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_7_5.htm">7:5-7</a>).<p>By Midian are here meant those who care nothing for truth, because they are merely natural and external, therefore they were smitten by those who lapped water in their hand with their tongue like a dog; for by these are meant those who desire truths, that is those who from some natural affection have a desire to know truths, for a dog signifies appetite and desire, waters signify truths, and lapping them with the tongue signifies to long for, and to be affected with desire; Midian was therefore smitten by these. Who cannot see that this would not have been commanded unless it had been significative?</p><p>[10] In David:<p>"Thou hidest them in the secret of thy faces from the pride of man; thou concealest them in a tabernacle from the strife of tongues" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_31_20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>).<p>Here the secret of the faces in which Jehovah hides them, signifies the Divine Good of the Divine Love, for the "faces of Jehovah" signifies the good of love and secret signifies interiorly in man. The pride of man signifies the pride of his own intelligence; the tabernacle in which He concealed them signifies Divine Truth; and the strife of tongues signifies the falsity of religion, from which they reason against truths. Hence it is evident what these words signify in a series.</p><p>[11] In Jeremiah:<p>"Lo, I will bring a nation upon you, a nation whose tongue thou shalt not know, nor understand what they say; they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">5:15-17</a>).<p>It is not meant by these words that a nation of an unknown tongue, or of an unintelligible speech, should be brought; but an evil nation of an altogether different religion is meant, whose dogmas they would not know, nor would understand the reasonings based on them. In the abstract sense the falsities of evil are signified, which are altogether opposite to the truths of good; for nation, in the abstract sense, denotes evil, and tongue in this case the falsity of religion, and to speak denotes to reason therefrom, therefore the words follow, "they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread." For by harvest are signified truths by means of which there is good, by bread is signified the good thence, and eating up signifies to consume and take away.</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>"For thou art not sent to a people deep of lip, and heavy of tongue; unto the house of Israel; not to great peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue whose words thou hast not understood; had I sent thee to them, would they not have obeyed thee?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_5.htm">3:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_6.htm">6</a>).<p>A people deep of lip and heavy of tongue, whose words cannot be understood, signifies those who are in unintelligible doctrine, and thence in an abstruse religion, whose dogmas cannot be apprehended. Lip signifies doctrine, tongue religion, and words the dogmas thereof. Wherefore by these people are meant the Gentiles who do not possess the Word, from which Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is known. That they would receive Divine truths if instructed, is signified by their obeying, if he had been sent unto them.</p><p>[13] In Isaiah:<p>"Thou shalt not see an obdurate people, a people of depths of lip that thou understandest not, barbarous in tongue [in which there is] no intelligence" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_19.htm">33:19</a>).<p>By a people of depths of lip and by barbarous in tongue are signified similar things to those meant by peoples of a deep lip and heavy of tongue mentioned above. It is evident that a people whose speech is unintelligible is not meant, for it is also said, and barbarous in tongue [in which there is] no intelligence, for there may be intelligence in the tongue or speech, but not in their religion.</p><p>[14] Again:<p>"I have sworn, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_23.htm">45:23</a>).<p>The subject here is the coming of the Lord, and by every knee shall bow, is signified that all those who are in natural from spiritual good shall worship Him, the knee signifying the conjunction of natural good with spiritual. Hence it is evident that bending the knees signifies acknowledgment, thanksgiving, and adoration from spiritual good and delight in the Natural. Every tongue shall swear, signifies that all will confess Him who are in good from religion; to swear denotes to confess, and the tongue denotes the religion according to which they live.</p><p>[15] In David:<p>"My tongue shall speak of thy justice all the day, and of thy praise" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_28.htm">Psalm 35:28</a>).<p>Here also the tongue signifies confession from the doctrine of the church, for it is said that it speaks; justice is stated of the good, and praise of the truth thereof, as in other parts of the Word.<p>So again:<p>"My tongue also shall speak of thy justice all the day long" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_71_24.htm">Psalm 71:24</a>).</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>"Let" the wicked "beset me with gall; the mischief of their lips covers them; burning coals overwhelm them. Let them be cast into deep pits by fire that they rise not again. A man of tongue shall not be established in the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_140_9.htm">Psalm 140:9-11</a>).<p>Gall signifies truth falsified, which in itself is falsity; the mischief of their lips signifies the falsity of doctrine thence, for lips signify doctrine. By burning coals overwhelming them, and by the fire by which they are to be cast into deep pits are signified pride on account of their own intelligence, and the love of self through which they fall into absolute falsities; burning coals signify the pride of one's own intelligence; fire, the love of self; and pits, falsities. All falsities of doctrine in the church, and all falsifications of the Word, exist also from the pride of man's own intelligence, and from the love of self. It is evident, therefore, that a man of tongue shall not be established in the earth, signifies a false religion.</p><p>[17] Again:<p>"I lie down, my soul in the midst of lions; the sons of men are inflamed; their teeth are spears and darts, and their tongue is a sharp sword" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>).<p>Lions signify those who plunder the church of truths, and thus destroy it; the sons of men who are inflamed signify those who are in the truths of the church, and in the abstract, the truths themselves, which are said to be inflamed by the pride of man's own intelligence, whence arise falsities. Their teeth are spears and darts, signifies reasonings from external sensuals, and thus from the fallacies and falsities of religion, by which truths are destroyed, the teeth signifying the ultimates of the life of man, which are external sensual things, and in the present case reasonings from them. The tongue signifies the falsities of religion, wherefore it is said, "their tongue is a sharp sword," for by a sword is signified the destruction of truth by falsities.</p><p>[18] So in Job:<p>"Wilt thou draw out leviathan with a hook? and press down his tongue with a rope?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_41_1.htm">Job 41:1</a>).<p>In this and the preceding chapter, the behemoth and the leviathan are spoken of, and each signifies the natural man. The behemoth signifies the natural man in regard to goods, which are called the delights of natural love; and the leviathan, the natural man in regard to truths, which are called scientifics and knowledges, from which there is natural light (lumen). Both of these are described by pure correspondences, in the ancient style of writing. That reasoning by means of scientifics (scientifica) from the light of nature cannot be restrained except by God, is described in this and the following chapter by the leviathan, and also by these words, "Wilt thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or press down his tongue with a rope?" The tongue signifies reasoning from scientifics. That the leviathan signifies the natural man in regard to scientifics, is evident from other passages, where it is named, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a>, and also from the fact that the sea-monster, which is meant by the leviathan, signifies the natural man as to scientifics.</p><p>[19] Again, in Isaiah:<p>"The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be swift to speak" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_32_4.htm">32:4</a>).<p>The rash mean those who readily seize upon and believe whatever is said, and therefore falsities also. Of these it is said, that they shall understand and know, which means to receive truths. The stammerers mean those who are able to apprehend the truths of the church only with difficulty; their tongue shall be swift to speak means, that they shall confess them from affection; "swift," is said of affection.</p><p>[20] In the same prophet:<p>"Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing; for in the desert shall waters break out, and rivers in the plain of the desert" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">35:6</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the coming of the Lord. The lame signify those who are in good, but not in genuine good, because in ignorance of truth, by means of which good exists; to leap as a hart signifies to have joy from perception of truth. The dumb signify those who cannot confess the Lord, nor the genuine truths of the church, because of their ignorance of truth; by their singing is signified joy from the understanding of truth. By waters breaking out in the desert is signified that truths shall be made known where they did not exist before; and rivers in the plain of the desert signify intelligence there, for waters signify truths, and rivers, intelligence.</p><p>[21] From these explanations it is evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by the deaf man, who had an impediment in his speech, and whom the Lord healed as recorded in Mark.<p>Jesus took the deaf man that had an impediment in his speech, "and put his finger into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened; and straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plainly" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7337.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7337</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9031.htm">9031</a>). The deaf man signifies those who are not in the understanding of truth, and therefore not in obedience. By an impediment in his speech are signified those who confess the Lord and the truth of the church with difficulty; the opening of his ears by the Lord signifies obedience and the perception of truth; and by the tongue, whose string was loosed by the Lord, is signified the confession of the Lord, and of the truths of the church.</p><p>[22] By the apostles and others speaking with new tongues after the resurrection of the Lord, was also signified the confession of the Lord, and of the truths of the new church; concerning this it is thus written in Mark:<p>Jesus said, "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_17.htm">16:17</a>).<p>The casting out of devils, means the removal and rejection of the falsities of evil, and speaking with new tongues, confession of the Lord and the truths of the church from Him. Therefore to the apostles "there appeared cloven tongues like as of fire, which sat upon them. And then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/romans_2_3.htm">2:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/romans_2_4.htm">4</a>). By the fire was signified the love of truth; by being filled with the Holy Spirit, was signified the reception of Divine Truth from the Lord; and by new tongues are meant confessions from the love of truth or from zeal. For, as said above, all Divine miracles, therefore all the miracles recorded in the Word, involved and signified spiritual and celestial things, that is to say, such things as pertain to heaven and the church, for this distinguishes Divine miracles from miracles not Divine. It would be superfluous to adduce more passages from the Word to prove that tongues do not mean speech in the ordinary meaning of the word, but confessions from the truths of the church, and, in the opposite sense, confessions from the falsities of religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 455</h4><p>455. And peoples and tongues, signifies all who are in falsities from ignorance and from various religions. This is evident from the signification of "peoples," as being those who are in the truths of doctrine, and in a contrary sense those who are in the falsities of doctrine (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>; but here, those who are in the falsities of doctrine from ignorance; for here are treated of those who are saved, although from the doctrine of their religion they have been in falsities. All those who are in the good of life in accordance with the dogmas of their religion, which they have believed to be true although they are not true, are saved, for falsity is not imputed to anyone who lives well according to the dogmas of his religion, because it is not his fault that he is ignorant of truths. For the good of life in accordance with a religion contains within itself the affection of knowing truths, and these truths are learned and accepted when such persons come into the other life, for every affection remains with man after death, and especially the affection of knowing truths, because this is a spiritual affection; and when man becomes a spirit, he is his affection; consequently the truths that are then desired are imbibed and thus received deeply in the heart. (That when a man lives well falsities of religion are accepted by the Lord as truths, see above, n. <a href="../ae/452.htm">452</a>.) The above is evident from the signification of "tongues," as meaning their confessions from religion, for "tongues" mean speech, and "speech" signifies confession and religion, because the tongue utters and confesses the things that pertain to religion.</p><p>[2] There is frequent mention in the Word of the "lip," the "mouth," and the "tongue;" and the "lip" signifies doctrine, the "mouth" thought, and the "tongue" confession. "Lip," "mouth," and "tongue," have this signification because these are the externals of man, by means of which things internal find expression, and it is things internal that are signified in the internal or spiritual sense. For the Word in the letter consists of external things that are manifest before the eyes and are perceived by the senses, therefore the Word in the letter is natural, and this in order that the Divine truth that it contains may be there in what is ultimate and thus in fullness. But these external things, which are natural, include in themselves things internal that are spiritual, and these therefore are the things that are signified.</p><p>[3] That "tongues" signify confessions from religion, and according to the dogmas of religion, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>The time shall come for bringing together all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord's coming; "nations and tongues" signify all who are in the good of life according to their religions; "tongues" signify religions from confessions; it is therefore said "that they may come and see My glory," "glory" signifying Divine truth, by which the church exists.</p><p>[4] In Daniel:<p>Behold, with the clouds of the heavens one like the Son of man. And there was given Him dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, tongues, and nations might worship Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_14.htm">14</a>).<p>"The Son of man who was to come in the clouds of the heavens," evidently means the Lord, and "the clouds of the heavens" mean the Word in the letter, in which it is said that the Lord is to come, for the Word treats of Him, and in the inmost sense of Him alone. Therefore it is said "Son of man," because the Lord is called "the Son of man" from Divine truth, which is the Word. But respecting this see more above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>).<p>The Lord's power from Divine good is meant by "dominion," and from Divine truth by "glory," and heaven and the church are meant by "kingdom." "Peoples, tongues, and nations," signify all those who are in doctrine and in a life according to their religions; those who are in doctrine are called "peoples," those who are in life "nations," and "tongues" mean religions.</p><p>[5] In Zechariah:<p>In those days ten men out of all tongues of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you (<a href="../ae/433.htm">433</a>; namely, that a "Jew" means those who are in love to the Lord and in the truths of doctrine from Him; and that "all tongues of the nations" mean those who are of various religions.</p><p>[6] "Tongues" have a like signification in the following passages.<p>In Moses:<p>From these were the islands of the nations separated in their lands, every man according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations. The habitations of the sons of Shem, according to their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_31.htm">31</a>).<p>In Revelation:<p>Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_10_11.htm">Revelation 10:11</a>).<p>Again:<p>And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_11_9.htm">Revelation 11:9</a>).<p>Again:<p>And it was given unto the beast to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and there was given him power over every tribe and tongue and nation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>).<p>Again:<p>I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to proclaim unto those that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>).<p>And again:<p>The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>).<p>"Waters" here signify the truths of the Word, for "waters" in the Word signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities; therefore here "peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues," mean those who are in truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and are consequently in evils of life.</p><p>[7] In Luke:<p>The rich man said to Abraham, Have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and may cool my tongue, for I am tortured in this flame (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>).<p>In this parable, as in others, the Lord spake by correspondences, as can be seen by this, that the "rich man" does not mean the rich, nor does "Abraham" mean Abraham, nor by "the water with which Lazarus might cool the tongue" are water and tongue meant, nor does the "flame" mean flame, for in hell no one is tortured by flames; but a "rich man" means those who are of the church where the Word is, from which they have spiritual riches, which are truths of doctrine; so the "rich man" here means the Jews, with whom was the Word at that time; "Abraham" means the Lord; the "water into which Lazarus might dip the tip of his finger" signifies truth from the Word; and "tongue" signifies a thirst and eagerness to pervert the truths that are in the Word; and the "flame" the punishment of that eagerness, which is various and manifold. This makes evident what these things signify in the series, and that "to cool the tongue with water" signifies to allay the thirst and the eagerness to pervert truths, and to confirm falsities thereby. Who cannot see that it does not mean that Lazarus should dip the tip of his finger in water to cool the tongue?</p><p>[8] In Zechariah:<p>This shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will strike all the peoples that shall fight against Jerusalem; his flesh shall waste away as he stands upon his feet, and his eyes shall waste away in their sockets and his tongue shall waste away in his mouth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>).<p>This is said of those who endeavor to destroy the truths of doctrine by means of falsities; and this is signified by "fighting against Jerusalem," "Jerusalem" signifying the church in respect to doctrine, and thence the truths of the doctrine of the church; "the flesh shall waste away" signifies that all good of love and of life will perish, for this is what "flesh" signifies; "standing upon his feet" means upon bones without flesh, which signifies that they will be wholly corporeal-natural, "feet" signifying the things that belong to the natural man, here its lowest things; "his eyes shall waste away in their sockets" signifies that all the understanding of truth will perish, "eyes" signifying the understanding; "his tongue shall waste away in his mouth" signifies that all the perception of truth and all the affection of good will perish; "tongue" signifying also the perception of truth and the affection of good, the perception of truth from its speaking, and the affection of good from its power of tasting, for "taste" signifies appetite, desire, and affection.</p><p>[9] In the book of Judges:<p>Jehovah said unto Gideon, Everyone that lappeth the waters with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; and everyone that boweth down upon his knees to drink. And the number of them that lapped in their hand were three hundred men; and these were led against Midian and smote him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_7_5.htm">Judges 7:5-7</a>).<p>"Midian" here means those who do not care for truth, because they are merely natural and external; therefore Midian was smitten by those who "lapped the waters in the hand with the tongue like a dog;" these mean such as have an appetite for truths, thus they who from some natural affection seek to know truths, a "dog" signifying appetite and eagerness, "waters" truths, and "lapping them with the tongue" to have an appetite for and eagerly seek. So it was by these that Midian was smitten. Anyone can see that such things would not have been commanded unless they had been significative.</p><p>[10] In David:<p>Thou hidest them in the hiding place of Thy faces from the pride of man; Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_31_20.htm">Psalms 31:20</a>).<p>"A hiding place of faces in which Jehovah hides them," signifies the Divine good of the Divine love, for "the face of Jehovah" signifies the good of love, and "the hiding place" signifies inwardly in man; "the pride of man" signifies the pride of self-intelligence; the "pavilion in which He hides them" signifies Divine truth; and "the strife of tongues" signifies the falsity of religion from which they reason against truths. This makes clear what these things signify in series.</p><p>[11] In Jeremiah:<p>Lo, I will bring upon you a nation, a nation whose tongue thou shalt not know nor shall thou understand what they speak. It shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_17.htm">17</a>).<p>This does not mean that a nation of an unknown tongue or of an unintelligible speech should be brought; but an evil nation of an utterly different religion is meant, whose dogmas they shall not know nor understand the reasonings therefrom; and in an abstract sense the falsities of evil which are altogether contrary to the truths of good are signified; for "nation" in an abstract sense means evil, and "tongue" here means the falsity of religion, and "to speak" means to reason therefrom; therefore it is added, "it shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread," for "harvest" signifies truths by which there is good, "bread" the good therefrom, and "to eat up" to consume and deprive.</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>Thou art not sent to a people of deep lip and heavy of tongue, but to the house of Israel; not to great peoples of deep lip and heavy of tongue, whose words thou shalt not hear. If I should send thee to them, will they not hearken unto thee? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_5.htm">Ezekiel 3:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_6.htm">6</a>).<p>"Peoples of deep lip and heavy of tongue, whose words are not heard," signify those who are in an unintelligible doctrine, and thus in an abstruse religion, whose dogmas cannot be comprehended, "lip" signifying doctrine, "tongue" religion, and "words" its dogmas; therefore these peoples mean the nations that do not have the Word, by which Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is known. That these will receive Divine truths when they are instructed is signified by "these would hearken if he should be sent unto them."</p><p>[13] In Isaiah:<p>Thou wilt not see an obstinate people, a people of depths of lip that thou canst not hear; barbarous in tongue, without intelligence (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>).<p>"A people of depths of lip and barbarous in tongue" has a similar signification here as "peoples of deep lip and heavy of tongue" above. Evidently a people with a speech that cannot be understood is not meant; for it is added, "barbarous in tongue, without intelligence," for there may be intelligence in the tongue or speech of such, but not in their religion.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>I have sworn that unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>).<p>This is said of the coming of the Lord; and "every knee shall bow" signifies that all who are in natural good from spiritual good will worship Him, the "knee" signifying the conjunction of natural good with spiritual. This shows that bending the knees signifies acknowledgment, thanksgiving, and adoration from spiritual good and delight in the natural; "every tongue shall swear" signifies that all will confess the Lord who are in good from religion, "to swear" signifying to confess, and "tongue" religion according to which one lives.</p><p>[15] In David:<p>And my tongue shall meditate of Thy righteousness and of Thy praise all the day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_28.htm">Psalms 35:28</a>).<p>Here, too, "tongue" signifies confession from the doctrine of the church, for it is said "to meditate of;" "righteousness" is predicated of the good of the church, and "praise" of its truth, as also elsewhere in the Word. So again in the same:<p>My tongue shall meditate of Thy righteousness all the day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_71_24.htm">Psalms 71:24</a>).</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>With gall the wicked compass me, the mischief of their lips doth cover them; burning coals overwhelm them; with fire let them be cast into pits, that they rise not again; a man of tongue shall not be established in the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_140_9.htm">Psalms 140:9-11</a>).<p>"Gall" signifies truth falsified, which in itself is falsity; "the mischief of their lips" signifies the falsity of doctrine therefrom, for "lips" signify doctrine; "burning coal by which they are overwhelmed," and the "fire with which they are to be cast into pits," signify the pride from self-intelligence and the love of self, through which they fall into mere falsities, "burning coals" signifying the pride of self-intelligence, "fire" the love of self, and "pits" falsities. Moreover all falsities of doctrine in the church and all falsifications of the Word spring from the pride of self-intelligence and from the love of self. This makes evident what is signified by "a man of tongue shall not be established in the earth," namely, a false religion.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>My soul, I lie in the midst of lions, the sons of man are set on fire, their teeth are spear and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalms 57:4</a>).<p>"Lions" signify those who plunder the church of truths, and thus destroy it; the "sons of man who are set on fire," signify those who are in the truths of the church, and in an abstract sense the truths themselves, which are said to be "set on fire" by the pride of self-intelligence, whence come falsities; "their teeth are spear and arrows" signifies reasonings from external sensuals and thus from the fallacies and falsities of religion, by which truths are destroyed, "teeth" signifying the ultimates of man's life, which are external sensual things, and here reasoning from these, and "tongue" signifying the falsities of religion; therefore it is said "their tongue a sharp sword," "sword" signifying the destruction of truth by falsities.</p><p>[18] In Job:<p>Wilt thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook, and overwhelm his tongue with a cord? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_12_1.htm">Job 12:1</a>)<p>In this and the preceding chapter the Behemoth and the leviathan are treated of, and both signify the natural man, the "Behemoth" the natural man in respect to goods which are called the delights of natural love, and the "leviathan" the natural man in respect to truths which are called knowledges and cognitions, from which is natural light. These are both described by pure correspondences according to the ancient style. That reasoning from the light of nature by means of knowledges [scientifica] can be restrained by God only, is described in that chapter and the subsequent one by the "leviathan," and also by these words, "Wilt thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook, and overwhelm his tongue with a cord?;" "tongue" signifying reasoning from knowledges [scientifica]. That the "leviathan" signifies the natural man as regards knowledges [scientifica] can be seen from other passages where it is mentioned (as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_14.htm">Psalms 74:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_26.htm">Psalms 104:26</a>). Also from the fact that the "whale," by which the leviathan is meant, signifies the natural man in regard to knowledges [scientifica].</p><p>[19] In Isaiah:<p>The heart of the hasty shall have intelligence for knowing, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be swift to speak (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_32_4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>).<p>The "hasty" mean those who readily seize upon and believe whatever is said, thus also falsities; of such it is said that "they shall be intelligent and know," that is, receive truths; "stammerers" mean those who are hardly able to apprehend the truths of the church; that they will confess them from affection is meant by "their tongue shall be swift to speak," "swiftness" is predicated of affection.</p><p>[20] In the same:<p>Then shall the lame leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing aloud; for waters shall break out in the wilderness, and brooks in the plain of the desert (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>).<p>This is said of the coming of the Lord; the "lame" signifies those who are in good but not genuine good, because they are in ignorance of truth through which good comes; "to leap as a hart" signifies to have joy from the perception of truth; the "dumb" signifies those who on account of ignorance of truth are unable to confess the Lord and the genuine truths of the church; "he shall sing" signifies joy from the understanding of truth; "waters shall break out in the wilderness" signifies that truths shall be opened where they were not before; and "brooks in the plain of the desert" signify intelligence there, for "waters" signify truths, and "brooks" intelligence.</p><p>[21] This makes clear what is signified in the spiritual sense by "the deaf man that had an impediment in his speech" whom the Lord healed, which is thus described in Mark:<p>Jesus took aside the deaf man who had an impediment in his speech, and put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, touched his tongue; and looking up into heaven, He said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened; and straightway his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake aright (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7337.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7337</a>) seen (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8364.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8364</a>) in (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9031.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9031</a>) the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7337.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7337</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9031.htm">9031</a>). The "deaf man" signifies those who are without the understanding of truth, and thence in no obedience; "his difficulty in speaking" signifies the difficulty of such in confessing the Lord and the truth of the church; the "ears" opened by the Lord signify the perception of truth and obedience; and the "tongue" whose bond was loosed by the Lord signifies the confession of the Lord and of the truths of the church.</p><p>[22] Again, that the apostles and others after the Lord's resurrection spoke with new tongues signifies also the confession of the Lord and of the truths of the new church. This is thus referred to in Mark:<p>Jesus said, These signs shall follow them that believe; in My name shall they cast out demons, and they shall speak with new tongues (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_17.htm">Mark 16:17</a>).<p>"To cast out demons" signifies to remove and reject the falsities of evil; and "to speak with new tongues" signifies to confess the Lord and the truths of the church from Him. So:<p>To the apostles there appeared divided tongues like as of fire, which sat on them. And being filled with the Holy Spirit they began to speak with other tongues (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_3.htm">Acts of the Apostles 2:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_4.htm">4</a>).<p>The "fire" signified the love of truth, and "filled with the Holy Spirit" signified the reception of Divine truth from the Lord; and "new tongues" signified confessions from the love of truth or zeal; for, as was said above, all Divine miracles, consequently all miracles mentioned in the Word, involved and signified things spiritual and celestial, that is, such things that pertain to heaven and the church: by this Divine miracles are distinguished from miracles not Divine. It is unnecessary to quote more passages from the Word to show that "tongues" do not mean speech in the ordinary sense, but confessions from the truths of the church, and in the contrary sense confessions from the falsities of any religion. </p>
