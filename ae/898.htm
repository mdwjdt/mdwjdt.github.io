<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 898</h4><p>898. Write. That this signifies certainty, is evident from the signification of writing, as denoting certainty. For what is said from heaven, and commanded to be written, is as if it had been written down; thus it is truth, and consequently certain; here that those who suffer spiritual temptations shall have consolations, and be blessed.<p>The reason why to write signifies certainty is, that writing is the final act of the thought and consequently of discourse, and therefore certain, because terminated. None of the things that a man wills, thinks, and thence speaks, but does not ultimate by doing them, are yet in man's life; for the ultimate is wanting, in which prior things coexist. That by writing is thence signified to inscribe on the life may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/222.htm">222</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 898</h4><p>898. Write, signifies certainty. This is evident from the signification of "writing," as being certainty; for that which is said from heaven, and is commanded to be written, is like what has been endorsed, and thus is true, and consequently certain; here it means that those who endure spiritual temptations shall have consolations and be happy. "To write" signifies certainty because writing is the ultimate act of thought and of speech therefrom, and thus it means what is certain, because what is terminated. This may be compared with all things that a man wills, thinks, and speaks therefrom, and does not terminate by doing them; such things are not yet in man's life, for the ultimate in which prior things exist together is lacking. That "writing" thus signifies to inscribe on the life may be seen above n. <a href="../ae/222.htm">222</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 898 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>898. "Scribe." Quod significet certitudinem, constat ex significatione "scribere", quod sit certitudo; nam quod e caelo dicitur, et mandatur ut scribatur, id est sicut quod subscriptum est, ita verum et inde certum; hic, quod consolationes habituri sint, et beati futuri, qui tentationes spirituales patiuntur. <p>Quod "scribere" significet certitudinem, est quia scriptio est ultimus actus cogitationis et inde sermonis, ac ita certum, quia terminatum: se habent haec sicut omnia quae homo vult, cogitat et inde loquitur, et non terminat illa per facere; illa nondum sunt in vita hominis, nam deest ultimum, in quo priora coexistant. Quod per "scribere" inde significetur inscribere vitae, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_898/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_222" target=_top>222</a>). </p>
