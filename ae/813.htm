<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 813</h4><p>813. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. This signifies that these are the things by means of which temptation takes place, and afterwards the implantation of truth from good among those who are made spiritual by the Lord, is evident from the signification of the patience of the saints, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of faith, as denoting the implantation of truth; and from the signification of saints, as denoting those who are in truths from good from the Lord (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>). Thus those who are made spiritual by the Lord are meant; for man is made spiritual by means of truths from good.<p>The reason why faith signifies the implantation of truth is, that faith in man is truth acknowledged in the heart; for unless it is acknowledged in the heart it cannot be his own faith. This is why, in the Old Testament, faith is nowhere mentioned, but truth instead of it. Indeed, the ancients, among whom the church existed, had not the least notion that faith was anything else but truth. They said, indeed, that they believed in God; but they understood by this the knowledge and understanding of truths, and at the same time, the willing and doing of them, and this from the Lord. It is, therefore, evident that faith signifies the implantation of truth.</p><p>[2] The reason why the patience of the saints signifies the temptation of the faithful, or of those who are made spiritual by the Lord is, that patience signifies spiritual patience, which is patience in sustaining temptations. And those are in that patience who, in themselves, fight against the falsities that are contained in and adhere to the dogma of faith alone, confirmed by reasonings from the natural man, also from a sinister application, and thereby a falsification, of the Word. The temptations which they sustain while they fight against falsities, are meant by patience. The signification of patience in Luke is similar:</p><p>[3] "Ye shall be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kindred, and friends; they shall also put some of you to death; yea, ye shall be hated of all, on account of my name; in your patience possess ye your souls" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_16.htm">21:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_19.htm">19</a>).<p>These words are spoken of the last time of the church, when judgment takes place. The temptations which the faithful shall then undergo on account of truths, are described by being delivered up by fathers, brethren, kindred, and friends, and by being put to death; also by being hated on account of the Lord's name. By parents, brethren, kindred, and friends, are meant those who belong to the same church, but are in evils and falsities. That these will undergo temptations are meant by being delivered up to death and being hated. Hence now the preservation of the life of truth amongst falsities, is signified by possessing their souls in patience, the soul signifying the life of truth.</p><p>[4] To the same purpose are these words:<p>"Those who are sowed in good land, are they who hear the Word in a simple and good heart, and retain it, and bring forth fruit in patience" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_15.htm">8:15</a>).<p>To bring forth fruit in patience signifies to do truths and goods, although they live amongst falsities and evils, that is, amongst those who are in falsities and evils. The Lord's patience in temptations, of which He suffered the most grievous, is described in these words in Isaiah:<p>"He sustained exaction, and he was afflicted, yet as a lamb he opened not his mouth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_7.htm">53:7</a>).<p>To sustain exaction signifies temptations. To be afflicted signifies their grievousness. To open not His mouth signifies patience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 813</h4><p>813. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints, signifies that through these comes temptation, and afterwards the implantation of truth from good with those who are made spiritual by the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "the patience of the saints" (of which presently); also from the signification of "faith," as being the implantation of truth; also from the signification of "saints," as being those who are in truths from good from the Lord (See above, n. <a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>), thus those who are made spiritual by the Lord; for man is made spiritual by truths from good. "Faith" signifies the implantation of truth because faith with man is truth acknowledged in the heart; for unless it is acknowledged in the heart it cannot be one's own faith; and this is why "faith" is nowhere mentioned in the Old Testament, but "truth" instead; and indeed, the ancient people with whom was the church were wholly ignorant that faith was anything else than truth; and when they said that they believed in God they meant by it knowing and understanding truths, and willing and doing them, and this from the Lord. Thence it is clear that "faith" signifies the implantation of truth.</p><p>[2] "The patience of the saints" signifies the temptation of the faithful, or of those who are made spiritual by the Lord, because "patience" signifies spiritual patience, which is patience in sustaining temptations; and those have that patience who fight in themselves against the falsities that are contained in the dogma of faith alone and that adhere to it; for that faith is confirmed by reasonings from the natural man and from the Word wrongly applied and thus falsified. The temptations that such sustain when they fight against falsities are meant by "patience."</p><p>[3] "Patience" has a like signification in Luke:<p>Ye shall be delivered up by parents and brethren, and kinsfolk and friends; some of you shall they cause to be put to death; yea, ye shall be hated by all for My name's sake: in your patience possess ye your souls (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_16.htm">Luke 21:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_19.htm">19</a>).<p>This is said of the last time of the church, when judgment takes place. The temptations that the faithful will then undergo on account of truths are described by "they shall be delivered up by fathers, brethren, kinsfolk, and friends, and be put to death," also "shall be hated for the sake of the Lord's name;" "parents, brethren, kinsfolk, and friends," meaning those who are of the same church, but who are in evils and falsities; their undergoing temptations is meant by "being delivered up to death" and "being hated;" therefore "in your patience possess ye your souls" signifies the preservation of the life of truth among falsities; "soul" signifying the life of truth.</p><p>[4] Again, in the same:<p>They who are sowed in the good land are those who in a simple and good heart hear the Word and hold fast, and bring forth fruit in patience (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>).<p>"To bring forth fruit in patience" signifies to do truths and goods even when living amid falsities and evils, that is, among those who are in falsities and evils. The Lord's patience in temptations, of which He suffered the most grievous of all, is described in these words in Isaiah:<p>He endured persecution and He was afflicted, yet like a lamb He opened not His mouth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<p>"Enduring persecution" signifies temptations; "to be afflicted" signifies their grievousness; "to open not His mouth" signifies patience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 813 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>813. "Hic est patientia et fides sanctorum." Quod significet quod haec sint per quae tentatio et dein implantatio veri ex bono apud illos qui spirituales fiunt a Domino, constat ex significatione "patientiae sanctorum" (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione fidei, quod sit implantatio veri; et ex significatione "sanctorum", quod sint qui in veris ex bono a Domino (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_813/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_204" target=_top>204</a>), ita qui spirituales a Domino fiunt, nam homo per vera ex bono spiritualis fit. Quod fides significet implantationem veri, est quia fides apud hominem est verum corde agnitum, nam nisi agnoscitur corde, non potest esse fides ejus; inde quoque est quod in Veteri Testamento nullibi dicatur fides, sed loco ejus veritas: immo antiqui, apud quos ecclesia fuit, prorsus non sciverunt quod fides aliud esset quam verum; dixerunt quidem quod crederent in Deum, sed per id intellexerunt tam scire et intelligere vera, quam velle et facere illa, et hoc a Domino: inde patet quod fides significet implantationem veri.<p>[2] Quod "patientia sanctorum" significet tentationem fidelium, seu illorum qui spirituales fiunt a Domino, est quia "patientia" <sup>1</sup></p><p>significat patientiam spiritualem, quae est patientia in sustinendis tentationibus; et illi in ea patientia sunt qui apud se pugnant contra falsa quae insunt et adhaerent dogmati de sola fide, confirmant enim illam per ratiocinia ex naturali homine, tum ex Verbo sinistre applicato et sic falsificato; tentationes quas illi sustinent, dum pugnant contra falsa, <sup>2</sup></p><p>intelliguntur per "patientiam."<p>[3] Simile significatur per "patientiam" apud Lucam,<p>"Trademini..a parentibus et fratribus, ac cognatis et amicis; morti etiam dabunt ex vobis; immo eritis odio habiti ab omnibus propter nomen meum:.... in patientia vestra possidete animas vestras" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_813/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_16" target=_top>21:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_813/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_813/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_19" target=_top>19</a>):<p>haec de ultimo tempore ecclesiae, quando judicium; tentationes, quas tunc subituri sunt fideles propter vera, <sup>3</sup></p><p>describuntur per quod "tradentur a patribus, fratribus, "cognatis et amicis", et quod "morti dabuntur", tum quod "odio habiti erunt propter nomen Domini"; per "parentes", "fratres", "cognatos" et "amicos" intelliguntur qui ab eadem ecclesia sunt, sed in malis et falsis; quod tentationes subituri sint, intelligitur per "morti tradi" et "odio haberi": inde nunc per "In patientia vestra <sup>4</sup></p><p>possidete "animas", significatur vitam veri inter falsa conservare; per "animam" significatur vita veri.<p>[4] Similiter apud eundem,<p>"Qui in terra bona seminati sunt, hi sunt qui in corde simplici et bono audiunt verbum, retinent, et fructum faciunt in patientia" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_813/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_8_15" target=_top>8:15</a>):<p>"fructum facere in patientia" significat vera ac bona facere, tametsi inter falsa et mala, hoc est, inter illos qui in falsis et malis sunt, vivunt. Patientia Domini in tentationibus, quas prae omnibus gravissimas sustinuit, describitur his verbis, apud Esaiam,<p>"Exactionem sustinuit, idemque afflictus est, non tamen aperuit os suum, sicut agnus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_813/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_53_7" target=_top>53:7</a>):<p>"exactionem sustinere" significat tentationes; "afflictus esse" significat gravitatem earum; "non aperire os suum" significat patientiam.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>3.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>4.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
