<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 153</h4><p>153. And his feet like fine brass. That this signifies the ultimate of Divine order, which is the Natural, full of Divine love, is evident from what was said and shown above (n. <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>), where similar words occur. Because in what is written to the angel of this church, the subject treated of is the internal of the church, which is spiritual, and its external, which is natural, that they should make one (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/150.htm">150</a>), therefore it is premised concerning the Lord, from whom is the all of the church,<p>"These things saith the Son of man, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass."<p>For by eyes, when said of men, is signified the internal, which is spiritual, and by feet the external, which is natural; but by eyes and feet, when said of the Lord, are signified the Divine things from which those exist with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 153</h4><p>153. And His feet like burnished brass, signifies the ultimate of Divine order, which is the natural, full of Divine love, as is evident from what is said and shown above n. <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>, where similar words occur. As what is written to the angel of this church treats of the internal of the church, which is spiritual, and its external, which is natural, that they must make one (See above, n. <a href="../ae/150.htm">150</a>), so it is prefaced by these things respecting the Lord, from whom is everything of the church, "These things saith the Son of God, that hath His eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like unto burnished brass;" for in respect to man, "eyes" signify the internal, which is spiritual, and "feet" the external, which is natural; but in respect to the Lord, "eyes" and "feet" signify the Divine things from which are the internal and external with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 153 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>153. "Et pedes suos similes chalcolibano." Quod significet ultimum ordinis Divini quod naturale, plenum Divino amore, constat ex illis quae supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_153/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69" target=_top>69</a>) dicta et ostensa sunt, ubi similia. Quia in scriptis ad Angelum hujus Ecclesiae agitur de ecclesiae interno quod spirituale, et de ejus externo quod naturale, quod unum facient (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_153/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_150" target=_top>150</a>), ideo praemittitur de Domino, a quo omne ecclesiae, "Haec dicit Filius <sup>1</sup></p><p>hominis habens oculos tanquam flammam ignis, et pedes similes chalcolibano"; per "oculos" enim respective ad homines significatur internum quod spirituale, et per "pedes" externum quod naturale; at per "oculos" et "pedes" respective ad Dominum significantur Divina, a quibus illa apud homines.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
