<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 605</h4><p>605. Verses 5-7. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, who created heaven, and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the sea, and the things that are therein, that there shall be time no longer. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God shall also be consummated, as he hath declared in good tidings to his servants the prophets.- "And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth," signifies the Lord, to whom all things of heaven and the church are subject; "lifted up his hand to heaven," signifies affirmation before the angels concerning the state of the church; "And sware by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages," signifies truth from his own Divine; "who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea, and the things that are therein," signifies the Lord as to all things interior and exterior; "of heaven and the church that there shall be time no longer," signifies that there would be no longer any understanding of Divine Truth, nor any state of the church therefrom. "But in the days [of the voice] of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound," signifies the last state of the church, and then revelation of Divine Truth; "the mystery of God shall also be consummated, as he hath declared in good tidings to his servants the prophets," signifies prediction in the Word concerning the coming of the Lord to be fulfilled when the end of the church is at hand. </p>
