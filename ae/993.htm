<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 993</h4><p>993. And they repented not of their works. That this signifies that they were not willing to live according to the Lord's precepts, is evident from the signification of repenting, as denoting to live a different life, and from the signification of their works, as denoting evils from falsities. For those who separate faith from works by saying that works, being man's, are not good, and that they are merit-seeking, thus not to be conjoined with faith, which is spiritual and justifying, do evils from falsities. For from a false principle a man cannot do anything good, and where good is not there is evil. It is different when man lives according to the Lord's precepts, which are, that evils must be abstained from, and that goods must be done. Therefore by not repenting of their works, is signified that they were not willing to live according to the Lord's precepts.<p>Continuation concerning the Sixth Precept:-</p><p>[2] That love truly conjugial contains in itself so many ineffable delights as to exceed all number and expression is evident from this, that it is the fundamental of all loves celestial and spiritual, because by it a man becomes love; for from it one conjugial partner loves another, as good loves truth, and truth loves good, or, representatively, as the Lord loves heaven and the church. Such love cannot exist except by a marriage, in which the man is truth, and the wife is good.<p>When a man has become such a love by marriage, then also he is in love to the Lord, and in love towards the neighbour, consequently, in the love of all good, and in the love of all truth; for from a man as love there cannot go forth anything but loves of every kind. This is why conjugial love is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven. And because it is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven, it is also a fundamental of all the delights and joys of heaven, for every delight and joy is from love. From these things it follows, that heavenly joys, in their order and degrees, derive their origin and cause from conjugial love.</p><p>[3] From the felicities of marriages it may be inferred in regard to the infelicities of adulteries, that the love of adultery is the fundamental of all infernal loves, which are intrinsically not loves, but hatreds; consequently, that from the love of adultery flow hatreds of every kind, both against God and the neighbour, in general, against every good and truth of heaven and the church; therefore every kind of infelicity is associated with it. For, as before said, from adulteries a man becomes a form of hell, and from the love thereof he becomes an image of the devil.<p>That from marriages, in which there is love truly conjugial, all delights and felicities increase even to the delights and felicities of the inmost heaven; and that all undelights and infelicities in marriage, in which there is the love of adultery, increase in direfulness; even to the lowest hell, may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/386.htm">Heaven and Hell 386</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 993</h4><p>993. And they repented not of their works, signifies that they were unwilling to live according to the Lord's commandments. This is evident from the signification of "repenting," as being to live a different life; also from the signification of "their works," as being evils from falsities. For those who separate faith from works do evils from falsities, in that they say that as works are from man they are not good but are meritorious, and therefore must not be joined with faith, which is spiritual and justifying. For a man can do nothing that is good from a false principle; and where there is no good there is evil. It is otherwise when a man lives according to the Lord's commandments, which are, that evils must be refrained from and goods must be done. Therefore "they repented not of their works" signifies not to be willing to live according to the Lord's commandments.<p>(Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment)</p><p>[2] That true conjugial love contains in itself so many ineffable delights that can neither be numbered nor described can be seen from the fact that this love is the fundamental love of all celestial and spiritual loves, since through that love man becomes love; for from it each of the marriage pair loves the other as good loves truth and truth loves good, thus representatively as the Lord loves heaven and the church. Such love can exist only through a marriage in which the man is truth and the wife is good. When a man through marriage has become such love he is also in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor, and thus in the love of all good and in the love of all truth. For from man as love there must proceed loves of every kind; therefore conjugial love is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven. And as it is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven it is also the fundamental of all the delights and joys of heaven, since every delight and joy is of love. From this it follows that heavenly joys, in their order and in their degrees, have their origins and their causes from conjugial love.</p><p>[3] From the felicities of marriages a conclusion may be drawn respecting the infelicities of adulteries, namely, that the love of adultery is the fundamental love of all infernal loves, which are in themselves not loves, but hatreds; consequently from the love of adultery hatreds of every kind gush forth, both against God and against the neighbor, and in general against every good and truth of heaven and the church; therefore to it all infelicities belong, for, as has been said before, from adulteries man becomes a form of hell, and from the love of adulteries he becomes an image of the devil. That from the marriages in which there is true conjugial love all delight and felicities increase even to the delights and felicities of the inmost heaven, and that all that is undelightful and unhappy in the marriages in which the love of adultery reigns increases in direfulness even to the lowest hell, can be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/386.htm">Heaven and Hell 386</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 993 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>993. "At non resipuerunt ex operibus suis." - Quod significet quod non voluerint vivere secundum praecepta Domini, constat ex significatione "resipiscere", quod sit aliam vitam agere; et ex significatione "operum suorum", quod sint mala ex falsis; nam qui separant fidem ab operibus, dicendo quod opera quia ab homine non sint bona, et quod sint meritoria, ita non conjungenda fidei quae est spiritualis et justificans, illi faciunt mala ex falsis; ex falso enim principio homo non operatur aliquod bonum, et ubi non bonum ibi est malum; aliter dum homo secundum praecepta Domini vivit, quae sunt, quod abstinendum sit a malis, et quod facienda sint bona: inde per "Non resipuerunt ex operibus suis", significatur quod non voluerint vivere secundum praecepta Domini.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Sexto Praecepto.)<p>Quod amor vere conjugialis in se tot ineffabiles jucunditates ut numeros et voces excedant, contineat, constare etiam potest ex eo, quod ille amor sit fundamentalis omnium amorum caelestium et spiritualium, quoniam homo per illum fit amor; amat enim conjux conjugem ex illo sicut bonum amat verum et verum amat bonum, ita repraesentative sicut Dominus amat caelum et ecclesiam; talis amor non potest existere quam per conjugium, in quo vir est verum et uxor bonum. Cum homo talis amor factus est per conjugium, tunc etiam in amore in Dominum est, et in amore erga proximum, proinde in amore omnis boni, et in amore omnis veri; nam ex homine ut amore non possunt nisi amores omnis generis procedere; inde est quod amor conjugialis sit amor fundamentalis omnium amorum caeli. Nunc quia est amor fundamentalis omnium amorum caeli, est etiam fundamentalis jucundorum et gaudiorum omnium caeli, nam omne jucundum et gaudium est amoris.<p>[3] Ex his sequitur quod gaudia caelestia in suo ordine et in suis gradibus ex amore conjugiali origines et causas trahant. Ex felicitatibus conjugiorum concludi potest ad infelicitates adulteriorum, quod nempe amor adulterii sit fundamentalis omnium amorum infernalium, quae in se non amores sunt, sed odia; proinde quod amor adulterii sit, ex quo scaturiunt odia omnis generis, tam contra Deum quam contra proximum, in genere contra omne bonum et verum caeli et ecclesiae; inde ei sunt omnes infelicitates; homo enim ex adulteriis fit forma inferni, et ex amore illorum fit imago diaboli, ut prius dictum est. Quod ex conjugiis, in quibus est amor vere conjugialis, omnes jucunditates et felicitates crescant usque ad jucunditates et felicicitates intimi caeli; et quod injucunditates et infelicitates, in conjugiis in quibus amor adulterii regnat, crescant diritate usque ad infimum infernum, videatur in opere De Caelo et Inferno (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_993/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_386" target=_top>386</a>). </p>
