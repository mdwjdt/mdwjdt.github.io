<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 763</h4><p>763. And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river.- That this signifies crafty reasonings in abundance concerning justification by faith alone from those who think sensually and not spiritually, is evident from the signification of a serpent, as denoting those who are sensual, and in an abstract sense the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural in man (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/70.htm">70</a>, <a href="../ae/581.htm">581</a>, <a href="../ae/739.htm">739</a>; that dragons also denote the sensual may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/714.htm">714</a>); from the signification of the woman, as denoting the church, which will be the New Jerusalem, and is treated of above; from the signification of mouth, as denoting thought, from which speech flows (concerning which also see above, n. <a href="../ae/580.htm">580</a>); from the signification of water, as denoting the truth of faith, and, in the opposite sense, falsity (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/483.htm">483</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>, <a href="../ae/537.htm">537</a>, <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>); from the signification of a river, as denoting intelligence from the understanding of truth, and, in the opposite sense, reasoning from falsities (concerning which also see above, n. <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>); therefore by casting out water as a river is signified reasoning from falsities in abundance. Crafty reasonings about justification by faith alone by those who think sensually and not spiritually, are here meant, because by the dragon are meant those who defend justification by faith alone, and who are sensual, and therefore think and reason sensually and not spiritually (that the dragon signifies those who defend justification by faith alone may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/714.htm">714</a>). This is meant because dragons and serpents signify the sensual, and because sensual men are crafty beyond others, and reason keenly from fallacies and falsities. That the dragon and serpent, in an abstract sense, signify craftiness, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/715.htm">715</a>, <a href="../ae/739.htm">739</a>, <a href="../ae/581.htm">581</a>). It is evident then from these things what is signified by the dragon casting out of his mouth after the woman water as a river.</p><p>[2] Because such things are signified, something shall also be said about the crafty reasonings of such in favour of justification by faith alone. Their dogma is, that man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law, which are goods of charity. But because in the Word of both Testaments they find works and deeds so frequently mentioned, as well as doing and loving, they cannot help saying that a man ought to live well; but because they have separated works or deeds from faith, as of no justifying or saving value, therefore they craftily bring these and faith together, but in such a manner that they rather separate than conjoin them. But their reasonings are too abundant and too crafty to be stated in a few words, they shall therefore be referred to in detail in a small work on Spiritual Faith, and be so presented as to be accommodated to the apprehension of even the simple. It is commonly believed - and they themselves who defend justification by faith alone also believe it - that these think and reason spiritually, because cleverly and craftily. But let it be understood that none can think and reason spiritually but those who are enlightened by the Lord, and who, therefore, are in the spiritual affection for truth; for such only are in the light of truth, and the light of truth is the light of heaven, from which the angels have intelligence and wisdom; it is that light which is called spiritual light, and consequently those who are in it are spiritual. But those who are in falsities, however acutely and subtly they may think and reason, are not spiritual, but natural, in fact they are sensual, for their thoughts, and the reasonings therefrom, are for the most part from the fallacies of the senses, which some adorn with eloquence, embellish with the flowers of rhetoric, and corroborate by appearances from nature alone; while others adduce facts (scientifica) and adapt them to their reasonings, and proclaim them from a fire of self-love and from the pride which they have in their own intelligence, thus with an intonation that seems like affection for truth. In such things does their craftiness consist, which appears like wisdom to those who cannot or dare not enter from any understanding into the things that pertain to the church and the Word. Sensual men have the ability to think, speak, and act, with so much craftiness, because all evil resides in a man's Sensual, and in it cunning is as predominant as intelligence is in the spiritual man. This has been made evident to me from the cunning of the infernals, which is of such a nature, and so great, that it cannot possibly be described; and in the hells all are sensual. This is the meaning of the Lord's words in Luke:<p>"The sons of this age in their generation are wiser (prudentiores) than the sons of light" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_8.htm">16:8</a>);<p>and by these words concerning the serpent in Moses:<p>"The serpent was more crafty than any wild beast of the field, which Jehovah God made" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_3_1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>);<p>the serpent signifies man's Sensual. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"That he might cause her to be carried away by the river." The explanation of this clause is omitted from the author's MS. But see <a href="../ae/762.htm">762</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 763</h4><p>763. Verse 15. And the serpent cast out after the woman out of his mouth water as a river, signifies crafty reasonings in abundance respecting justification by faith alone by those who think sensually and not spiritually. This is evident from the signification of a "serpent," as being those who are sensual, and in an abstract sense the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural in man (See above, n. <a href="../ae/70.htm">70</a>, <a href="../ae/581.htm">581</a>, <a href="../ae/739.htm">739</a>); that "dragons" also mean those who are sensual may be seen above n. <a href="../ae/714.htm">714</a>; also from the signification of "the woman," as being the church which will be the New Jerusalem (which is treated of in this chapter several times); also from the signification of "mouth," as being thought, from which is speech (See above n. <a href="../ae/580.htm">580</a>; also from the signification of "water," as being the truth of faith, and in the contrary sense falsity (See above, n. <a href="../ae/483.htm">483</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>, <a href="../ae/537.htm">537</a>, <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>); also from the signification of "river," as being intelligence from the understanding of the truth, and in the contrary sense reasoning from falsities (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>; consequently "casting out water as a river" signifies reasoning from falsities in abundance. Keen reasonings respecting justification by faith alone by those who think sensually and not spiritually are here meant, because "the dragon" means those who defend justification by faith alone, and who are sensual, and therefore think and reason sensually and not spiritually. (That "the dragon" signifies those who defend justification by faith alone may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/714.htm">714</a>.) This is meant for the reason also that "dragons" and "serpents" signify those who are sensual, and because sensual men are more crafty than the rest, and reason keenly from falsities and from fallacies. (That "the dragon" and "the serpent" in an abstract sense signify craftiness may be (Seen above, n. <a href="../ae/715.htm">715</a>, <a href="../ae/739.htm">739</a>, <a href="../ae/581.htm">581</a>.) From this it is clear what is signified by the words "the dragon cast out after the woman out of his mouth water as a river."</p><p>[2] Because such is the signification, something shall also be said about their crafty reasonings respecting justification by faith alone. Their dogma is that man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law, which are the goods of charity. But inasmuch as they find in the Word of both Testaments "works" and "deeds," as well as "doing" and "loving," so frequently mentioned, they can do no otherwise than affirm that one ought to live well; but since they have separated works or deeds from faith as not justifying and saving, they craftily join these and faith together, but still in such a manner that they rather separate than conjoin them. But as their reasonings are too abundant and too crafty to be set forth in a few words, therefore they shall be set forth in a small work on Spiritual Faith, and be so presented as to be comprehended even by the simple. It is commonly believed, and they themselves who defend justification by faith alone believe, that they think and reason spiritually because they think and reason keenly and craftily. But let it be known that only he who is in enlightenment from the Lord, and thence in the spiritual affection of truth, thinks and reasons spiritually, for these are in the light of truth, and the light of truth is the light of heaven from which the angels have intelligence and wisdom; that light is what is called spiritual light, and consequently those who are in that light are spiritual. But those who are in falsities, however keenly they may think and reason, are not spiritual, but natural, yea, sensual, for their thoughts and reasonings therefrom are for the most part from the fallacies of the senses, which some adorn with eloquence and embellish with the flowers of rhetoric, and confirm by appearances from nature alone, while others add knowledges and adapt them to their reasonings, and these they proclaim from the fire of self-love and the pride of self-intelligence therefrom that sounds like the affection of truth. In such things their craftiness consists, and to such as cannot or dare not enter with any understanding into the things that pertain to the church and the Word this seems to be wisdom. Sensual men have the ability to think, speak, and act craftily, because all evil has its seat in man's sensual, and in it cunning is as predominant as intelligence is in the spiritual man. This has been made evident to me by the cunning of the infernals, which is such and so great that it cannot be described; and in the hells all are sensual. This is the meaning of the Lord's words in Luke:<p>The sons of this age are for their own generation more prudent than the sons of the light (<a href="../ae/762.htm">762</a>) </p>

"<p>[2] Quia talia significantur, etiam aliquid dicetur de astutis ratiocinationibus illorum de justificatione per solam fidem. Dogma illorum est quod homo justificetur et salvetur per solam fidem absque operibus Legis, quae sunt bona charitatis: at quia in Verbo utriusque Testamenti vident quod toties dicantur "opera" et "facta", tum "facere" et "amare", non possunt aliter quam affirmare quod bene vivendum sit; sed quia separaverunt opera aut facta a fide sicut non justificantia et salvantia, astute conjungunt illa et fidem, sed usque ita ut potius separent quam conjungunt. Sed quia ratiocinationes illorum in tali copia sunt, et cum tali astutia, ut non paucis possint expromi, ideo in singulari opusculo De Fide Spirituali detegentur, et ad captum etiam simplicium sistentur videndae. Creditur in vulgo, et quoque credunt ipsi qui justificationem per solam fidem defendunt, quod spiritualiter cogitent et ratiocinentur, quia acute et astute: sed sciendum est quod nemo spiritualiter cogitet et ratiocinetur, quam qui in illustratione est a Domino, et inde in affectione veri spirituali; hi enim in luce veri sunt, et lux veri est lux caeli, ex qua intelligentia et sapientia est angelis; illa lux est quae vocatur spiritualis, et consequenter illi qui in ea luce sunt spirituales sunt: illi autem qui in falsis sunt, utcunque acute cogitant et ratiocinantur, non spirituales sunt, sed naturales, immo sensuales; sunt enim cogitationes et inde ratiocinationes illorum pleraeque ex fallaciis sensuum, quas aliqui eloquio exornant, ac flosculis concinnant, et per apparentias ex sola Natura confirmant; quidam autem scientifica ratiociniis addunt et inaptant, et ex igne amoris sui et inde fastus propriae intelligentiae illa pronuntiant, ita cum sono sicut affectionis veri. In talibus consistit astutia illorum, quae apparet sicut sapientia coram illis qui non aliquo intellectu possunt aut audent intrare in talia quae ecclesiae et Verbi sunt. Quod sensuales homines astute cogitare, loqui et agere possunt, est quia omne malum residet in sensuali hominis, et malitia in illo tantum excellet quantum intelligentia apud spiritualem hominem; ut mihi constare potuit ex malitia infernalium, quae talis est et tanta ut non describi possit; ac omnes in infernis sunt sensuales: hoc intelligitur per Domini verba apud Lucam,<p>Quod filii hujus saeculi prodentiores sint supra filios lucis in generatione sua (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_763/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_8" target=_top>Lucam 16:8</a>);<p>et per haec de serpente apud Mosen,<p>"Serpens fuit astutus prae omni fera agri, quam fecerat Jehovah Deus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_763/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_1" target=_top>Genesis 3:1</a>);<p>per "serpentem" significatur sensuale hominis. </p>
