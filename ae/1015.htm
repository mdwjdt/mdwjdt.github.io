<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1015</h4><p>1015. And there was a great earthquake. That this signifies the state of the church entirely changed, is evident from the signification of an earthquake, as denoting a change of the state of the church (concerning which see n. <a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>, <a href="../ae/499.htm">499</a>); for the earth signifies the church, and the quaking thereof a change of state; and its being called great, signifies that its state was entirely changed.<p>Continuation concerning the Seventh Precept:-</p><p>[2] Because hatred, which is the desire to kill, is the opposite of love to the Lord, and also of love towards the neighbour, and these loves make heaven with a man, it is evident that hatred, being thus opposite, makes hell with him. Nor is infernal fire anything else but hatred. Therefore, also, the hells appear as if in a fire of a dusky red according to the quality and degree of the hatred, and in a fire of dusky flame according to the quality and degree of revenge from hatred.<p>Because hatred and love are diametrically opposite to each other, and since hatred thence constitutes hell with a man, just as love constitutes heaven with him, therefore the Lord thus teaches:<p>"If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Be kindly disposed towards thine adversary, whilst thou art in the way with him; lest thine adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-26</a>).<p>By being delivered to the judge, and by the judge to the officer, and being cast into prison by him, is described the state of the man who is in hatred after death, from his having hated his brother in the world. By the prison is meant hell; and by paying the uttermost farthing is signified the punishment which is called the fire everlasting. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1015</h4><p>1015. And there was a great earthquake, signifies the state of the church wholly changed. This is evident from the signification of an "earthquake," as being a change of the state of the church (See n. <a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>, <a href="../ae/499.htm">499</a>); for the "earth" signifies the church, and its quaking signifies a change of state; and it was called "great" to signify that the state was wholly changed.<p>(Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment)</p><p>[2] Since hatred, which is to will to kill, is the opposite of love to the Lord and also of love towards the neighbor, and since these loves are what make heaven with man, it is evident that hatred, being thus opposite, is what makes hell with him. Nor is infernal fire anything else than hatred; and in consequence the hells appear to be in a fire with a dusky glow according to the quality and quantity of the hatred, and in a fire with a dusky flame according to the quantity and quality of the revenge from hatred.</p><p>[3] Since hatred and love are direct opposites, and since hatred in consequence constitutes hell with man, just as love constitutes heaven with him, therefore the Lord thus teaches:<p>If thou shalt offer thy gift upon the altar, and shalt there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming, offer thy gift. Be well disposed towards thine adversary whiles thou art in the way with him; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt not come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_23.htm">Matthew 5:23-26</a>).<p>To be delivered to the judge, and by the judge to the officer, and by him to be cast into prison, describes the state of the man who is in hatred after death from his having been in hatred against his brother in the world, "prison" meaning hell, and "to pay the last farthing" signifies the punishment that is called everlasting fire. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1015 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1015. "Et terrae motus factus est magnus." - Quod significet statum ecclesiae prorsus immutatum, constat ex significatione "terrae motus", quod sit mutatio status ecclesiae (de qua (supra), n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1015/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_400" target=_top>400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1015/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_499" target=_top>499</a>); "terra" enim significat ecclesiam, ac "motus" mutationem status; et quia dicitur quod ille "factus sit magnus", significatur, quod status prorsus immutatus sit.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Septimo Praecepto.)<p>Quoniam odium, quod est velle occidere, est oppositum amori in Dominum, et quoque amori erga proximum, et hi amores faciunt caelum apud hominem, patet quod odium, quia est oppositum, faciat infernum apud illum. Ignis infernalis nec aliud est quam odium; quare etiam inferna apparent sicut in igne tetre rubente secundum quale et quantum odii, et in igne tetre flammante secundum quale et quantum vindictae ex odio.<p>[3] Quoniam odium et amor sunt sibi e diametro opposita, et quoniam inde odium facit infernum apud hominem, sicut amor facit caelum apud illum, ideo Dominus ita docet,<p>"Si .. obtuleris munus tuum super altare, et apud hoc recordatus fueris quod frater tuus habeat aliquid contra te, relinque ibi munus .. coram altari, et abi, prius reconciliare fratri tuo, et tunc veniens offer munus tuum. Esto benevolentiam iniens cum adversario tuo, dum in via es cum illo; ne quando te tradat adversarius judici, et judex tradat te ministro, et in carcerem conjiciaris; amen dico tibi, non exibis .. donec exsolveris ultimum dodrantem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1015/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_21-26" target=_top>Matthaeus 5:21-26</a>):<p>per "tradi judici, et a judice ministro, et ab hoc in carcerem conjici", describitur status hominis qui in odio est post mortem, ex eo quod in odio contra fratrem fuerat in mundo; et per "carcerem" intelligitur infernum, et per "exsolvere ultimum dodrantem" significatur poena, quae vocatur ignis aeternus. </p>
