<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 478</h4><p>478. And serve him day and night in his temple.- That this signifies that they are continually kept in truths in heaven, is evident from the signification of serving, as being said of those who are in truths, on which subject we shall speak presently; and from the signification of day and night, as denoting continually and in every state, upon which also we shall speak presently; and from the signification of the temple of God, as denoting heaven where Divine Truth reigns; concerning, which see above (n. <a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>, <a href="../ae/391.htm">391:2</a>). By these words it is therefore signified that they are continually kept in truths in heaven. The reason of this signification is, that these things are said of those who, during their life in the world, were in falsities from ignorance, as shown above; and those who are in falsities from ignorance, and yet in the good of life according to their religion, cannot be saved until their falsities have been removed, and truths implanted in their stead; and truths are implanted by means of temptations. When therefore they come out of temptations, the falsities still remain, although removed by means of truths; for nothing evil and false can be absolutely blotted out from man, spirit, or angel, but only removed. For they are withheld from their own evils and falsities, and retained in good and in truth by the Lord, and when this is the case, they seem to themselves to be as it were without evils and falsities; hence it is, that unless those who, in the world, had been in falsities from ignorance, were continually retained in truths by the Lord, they would relapse into falsities. This, therefore, is the meaning of the words "they serve him day and night in his temple." Temple also signifies heaven, where truths reign.</p><p>[2] That they were in the good of life according to their religion, is indeed the ground of their salvation, but this does not save as long as they are in falsities, therefore after their life in the world their falsities are removed. The reason that they cannot be saved before is, that good derives its essence from truths; for good is the esse [inmost being] of truth, and truth is the form of good, wherefore, as is the quality of truths, such is good. From these considerations also, it is clear, that although anyone may live well, yet he cannot come into heaven until he is in truths. On this account, there are places of instruction for those who are about to come into heaven, for no one can enter therein until he has been instructed. Concerning the instruction, and the places of instruction, for those who are about to come into heaven, see the <a href="../hh/512.htm">Heaven and Hell 512-520</a>).</p><p>[3] It is said that they serve Him day and night in His temple, but this does not mean that they are continually in a temple, or continually engaged in worship and prayers, for this is not the case in the heavens; there every one, just as in the world, is in his own office and employment, and in turn in a temple as in the world; but still they are said to serve God day and night in His temple, when they are continually in truths, for thus they interiorly serve Him continually. For every good spirit and angel is his own truth and his own good, because they are affections of truth and good. Affection or love constitutes the life of every one; therefore those who are in the affection for truth serve the Lord continually, even when engaged in their duties, business, and employments, for the affection which is within continually reigns and serves. The Lord also desires this service, but He does not desire that they should be engaged continually in temples and in worship. To be engaged in temples and in worship there, and not to be in truths, is not to serve the Lord; but to serve the Lord is to be in truths, and to act sincerely and justly in every thing, for then the true, sincere, and just things themselves in man, serve the Lord. By means of these also man can be in heaven after his life in the world, but not by means of worship alone, for worship without these, consequently without truths, is empty worship, into which there is no influx. In the Word mention is made of serving, and ministering, also of servants and ministers, and those are called servants of the Lord, and are said to serve Him who are in truths; and those are called ministers of the Lord, and are said to minister to Him, who are in good. That those are called servants in the Word who are in truths, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/6.htm">6</a>); and that those are called ministers who are in good (n. <a href="../ae/155.htm">155</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 478</h4><p>478. And they serve Him day and night in His temple, signifies that they are constantly held in truths in heaven. This is evident from the signification of "serving," which is said of those who are in truths (of which presently); also from the signification of "day and night," as being constantly and in every state (of which also presently); also from the signification of "the temple" of God, as being heaven where Divine truth reigns (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>, <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>); therefore these words signify that they are constantly held in truths in heaven. This is the signification, because this treats of those who had been during their life in the world in falsities from ignorance, as was shown above; and those who are in falsities from ignorance and yet in good of life according to their religion cannot be saved before the falsities in them have been withdrawn and truths have been implanted in their place; and truths are implanted by means of temptations. When, therefore, these come out of temptations the falsities still remain, although they have been withdrawn by means of truths; for nothing evil and false can be wholly wiped away from man, spirit, or angel, but only withdrawn; for the Lord withholds them from their evils and falsities and holds them in good and truth; and when this is done they seem to themselves to be without evils and falsities. For this reason, unless those who had been in falsities from ignorance in the world were constantly held in truths by the Lord, they would fall back into falsities. This, therefore, is what is meant by "they serve Him day and night in His temple," "temple" also signifying heaven where truths reign.</p><p>[2] Their having been in the good of life according to their religion saves them, indeed, but it does not save so long as they are in falsities, therefore after their life in the world the falsities in them are withdrawn. They cannot be saved before, because good derives its essence from truths; for good is the esse of truth, and truth is the form of good, therefore according to the quality of the truths is the good. From this it is clear that even though one lives well he cannot come into heaven until he is in truths. On this account there are places of instruction for those who are to come into heaven, because no one can come thither until he has been instructed (of this instruction and the places of instruction for those who are to come into heaven, see in the work on <a href="../hh/512.htm">Heaven and Hell 512-520</a>).</p><p>[3] It is said "they serve Him day and night in His temple," but this does not mean that they are continually in a temple, or continually in worship and prayers, for this is not done in the heavens. Everyone there, as in the world, is in his vocation and employment, and on occasion, as in the world, in the temple; and yet they are said "to serve God day and night in the temple" when they are constantly in truths; for thus inwardly they constantly serve Him. For every good spirit and angel is his own truth and his own good, for they are the affections of truth and good. Affection or love constitutes the life of everyone; consequently those who are in the affection of truth constantly serve the Lord, even when they are in their vocations, business, and employments, for the affection that is within reigns continually and serves. Moreover, this is the service the Lord desires, but not being constantly in temples and in worship. To be in temples in worship there, and not in truths, is not serving the Lord, but serving the Lord is to be in truths, and to act sincerely and justly in everything; for then the principles of truth, sincerity, and justice, that are with man, serve the Lord. Again, through these, but not through worship alone, a man after his life in the world can be in heaven, for worship without these, consequently without truths, is empty worship, into which no influx enters. In the Word mention is made of "serving" and "ministering," also of "servants" and "ministers," and those who are in truths are said to be "servants of the Lord," and "to serve Him," while those who are in good are said to be "ministers of the Lord," and "to minister to Him." (That those are called "servants" in the Word who are in truths, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/6.htm">6</a>; and that those are called "ministers" who are in good, n. <a href="../ae/155.htm">155</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 478 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>478. "Et serviunt Ipsi die et nocte in templo Ipsius." - Quod significet quod jugiter teneantur in veris in caelo, constat ex significatione "servire", quod dicatur de illis qui in veris sunt (de qua sequitur); ex significatione "die et nocte", quod sit jugiter et in omni statu (de qua etiam sequitur); et ex significatione "templi Dei", quod sit caelum ubi regnat Divinum Verum (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_478/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_220" target=_top>220</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_478/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a> [b]): inde per illa verba significatur quod jugiter teneantur in veris in caelo. Quod hoc significetur, est quia haec dicta sunt de illis qui, dum in mundo vixerunt, in falsis ex ignorantia fuerunt, ut supra ostensum est; et qui in falsis ex ignorantia sunt, et usque in bono vitae secundum religionem suam, illi non salvari possunt priusquam falsa apud illos sunt remota, et vera loco illorum implantata; et haec implantantur per tentationes: quare cum e tentationibus emergunt, falsa usque remanent, tametsi remota per vera; non enim aliquod malum et falsum ab homine, spiritu et angelo prorsus abstergi potest, sed modo removeri; detinentur enim a malis suis et falsis, et tenentur in bono et in vero a Domino; et cum hoc fit, sibi apparent sicut absque malis et falsis sint. Inde est, nisi illi qui in falsis ex ignorantia in mundo fuerunt jugiter tenerentur a Domino in veris, quod relaberentur in falsa. Hoc itaque est quod intelligitur per quod "serviant Ipsi die et nocte in templo Ipsius"; "templum" etiam significat caelum, ubi vera regnant.<p>[2] Quod fuerint in bono vitae secundum religionem suam, hoc quidem salvat, sed non salvat quamdiu in falsis sunt; quare post vitam in mundo falsa apud illos removentur: causa quod non prius salvari possint, est quia bonum trahit suam essentiam a veris, est enim bonum esse veri, et verum est forma boni; quapropter qualia sunt vera, tale fit bonum. Ex his etiam liquet quod tametsi aliquis bene vivit, usque in caelum venire nequeat antequam in veris est. Ob illum finem sunt loca instructionis pro illis qui venturi in caelum, nam nemo illuc venire potest priusquam instructus est. (De instructione et de locis instructionis pro illis qui venturi sunt in caelum, videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_478/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_512" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 512-520</a>.)<p>[3] Dicitur quod "serviant Ipsi die et nocte in templo Ipsius"; et per id non intelligitur quod continue sint in templo, aut continue in cultu et in precibus, nam ita non fit in caelis; ibi quisque, sicut in mundo, est in suo officio et opere, ac per vices, sicut in mundo, in templo; verum usque dicuntur "servire Domino die et nocte in templo", quando jugiter in veris sunt; sic enim interius jugiter serviunt: unusquisque enim bonus spiritus et angelus est suum verum et suum bonum, sunt enim affectiones veri et boni. Affectio seu amor facit vitam cujusvis; quapropter qui in affectione veri sunt, illi jugiter serviunt Domino, etiam quando in officiis, negotiis et operis sunt; affectio enim intus regnat continue, et servit. Hoc etiam servitium est quod Dominus vult, non autem quod jugiter in templis et in cultu sint: in templis et in cultu ibi esse et non in veris, hoc non est servire Domino; sed servire Domino est in veris esse, ac sincere et juste agere in omni re; nam tunc ipsa vera, sincera, et justa, quae apud hominem, serviunt Ipsi. Per illa etiam homo post vitam in mundo potest in caelo esse, non autem per solum cultum; nam cultus absque illis, proinde absque veris, est cultus vacuus, in quem non cadit influxus. In Verbo dicitur "servire" et "ministrare", tum "servi" et "ministri; ac illi dicuntur "servi Domini" et "servire Ipsi" qui in veris sunt, ac illi dicuntur "ministri Domini" et "ministrare Ipsi" qui in bono sunt. <p>(Quod "servi" in Verbo dicantur illi qui in veris sunt, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_478/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_6" target=_top>6</a>; et quod "ministri" qui in bono, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_478/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_155" target=_top>155</a>.) </p>
