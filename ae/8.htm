<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 8</h4><p>8. And he signified [this], sending by his angel unto his servant John. That this signifies, which are revealed to those who are in the good of love, is evident from the signification of he signified, as denoting those things which, in the sense of the letter, contain, and thus signify, those which are in the internal sense. For it is said, "the revelation which God gave to show; and he signified [this]"; and by the things which He signified are meant those which are in the sense of the letter, because all these are significative; and the things which are signified are those that are contained in the internal sense. For all things in the Word are significative of spiritual things which are in the internal sense. The above is also evident from the signification of sending by his angel, as denoting things revealed from heaven; for to send, denotes to reveal, and by an angel, denotes from heaven. The reason why to send denotes to reveal, is, because everything sent from heaven is a revelation; for what exists there is revealed, this being something spiritual concerning the church and its state; but this with man is turned into natural ideas, such as are in the sense of the letter, in the Apocalypse and other parts of the Word. That which comes from heaven cannot be present with man in any other way; for the Spiritual falls into its corresponding Natural, when it descends from the spiritual world into the natural. This is the reason why the prophetic Word Is such in the sense of the letter, and since it is such, that it is inwardly spiritual and Divine. By an angel means, from heaven, because that which an angel speaks is from heaven; for when an angel speaks with a man such things as relate to heaven and the church he does not speak as one man to another, who utters from memory the dictates of another, but that which an angel speaks enters into him continually by influx, and not into his memory, but directly into the understanding, and thence into words. This is the reason why every thing spoken by angels to the prophets was Divine, and nothing whatever from the angels. Whether it is said that such things are revealed from heaven, or from the Lord, it is the same; because the Divine of the Lord with the angels constitutes heaven, and nothing whatever from the proprium of the angels. (But this may be better understood from what is said and shown in the work, <a href="../hh/2.htm">Heaven and Hell 2-12</a>, and n. <a href="../hh/254.htm">254</a>.)</p><p>It is remarked above, that predictions are revealed from heaven to those who are in the good of love, because it is said, "sending by his angel unto his servant John," and by John are represented and meant those who are in the good of love. For by the twelve apostles were represented and signified all those in the church who are in truths from good consequently, all truths from good, from which the church is and by each apostle in particular is represented and signified something specific. For example, by Peter is represented and signified faith; by James, charity; and by John, the good of charity, or the good of love. Because John represented this good, therefore the revelation was made to him; for revelation from heaven, such as is here described, can be made to none but those who are in the good of charity or of love. Others, indeed, may hear the things that are uttered from heaven, but they cannot perceive them. They alone have spiritual perception who are in the good of love; the reason is, that they receive those things, not only in the hearing, but also in the love; and to receive in the love is to receive fully, since the things so received are loved; and those who thus receive, see those things in their understanding, in which is the sensation of their internal sight. That this is the case has been made evident to me from much experience, and it might also be illustrated by much rational argument; but upon this subject it is not yet permissible to speak. Here it is only necessary to observe, that all the names mentioned in the Word, signify, not persons, but things; thus, John signifies those who are in the good of love, and therefore, in the abstract, the good of love itself. (That all names in the Word signify things, may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/768.htm">Arcana Coelestia 768</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1888.htm">1888</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4310.htm">4310</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4442.htm">4442</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10329.htm">10329</a>.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 8</h4><p>8. And signified, sending by His angel, to His servant John, signifies which are revealed out of heaven to those who are in the good of love. This is evident from the signification of "signified," as being the things in the sense of the letter that contain and thus signify those that are in the internal sense; for it is said, "the revelation which God gave to show, and signified;" and by the things that He signified are meant those that are in the sense of the letter, because all these signify, while the things that are signified are those that are contained in the internal sense. For all things in the Word are significative of spiritual things, which are in the internal sense. This is also evident from the signification of "sending by His angel," as meaning, which are revealed out of heaven; for "to send" is to reveal, and "by an angel" is out of heaven. "To send" is to reveal, because everything that is sent out of heaven is revelation; for that which is there is what is revealed; and this is the spiritual which relates to the church and its state; but with man this is changed into the natural, such as is expressed in the sense of the letter in Revelation and elsewhere in the Word. That which comes out of heaven can be presented to man in no other way; for the spiritual falls into its corresponding natural when it descends out of the spiritual world into the natural. This is why the prophetic Word in the sense of the letter is such as it is, and being such, is in its bosom spiritual and is Divine. By "angel" is meant "out of heaven," because that which an angel speaks is out of heaven; for when an angel communicates to man such things as pertain to heaven and the church, he does not speak as man speaks with man, who brings forth out of his memory what another has told him; but that which an angel speaks flows in continuously, not into his memory, but immediately into his understanding, and from that into words. From this it is that all things that the angels spoke to the prophets are Divine, and nothing at all from the angels. Whether it be said, that these revelations are out of heaven, or are from the Lord, it is the same; because the Divine of the Lord with the angels constitutes heaven, and nothing whatever from the angels' proprium [selfhood, or what is their own]. (But this may be better understood from what is said and shown in <a href="../hh/2.htm">Heaven and Hell 2-12</a>, <a href="../hh/254.htm">254</a>).</p><p>[2] The things revealed out of heaven are said to be for those who are in the good of love, because it is said, "sending by His angel to His servant John," and by "John" those who are in the good of love are represented and meant. For by the twelve apostles are represented and signified all in the church who are in truths from good; consequently, all truths from good, from which is the church; and by each of the apostles in particular something special; thus by "Peter" faith; by "James" charity; and by "John" the good of charity or the good of love. Because John represented this good, the revelation was made to him; for revelation out of heaven, such as this, can be made only to those who are in the good of charity or of love. Others, indeed, can hear the things that are from heaven, but they cannot perceive them. Only those who are in the good of love have spiritual perception. This is because they receive heavenly things not only with the hearing, but also with the love; and to receive with the love is to receive fully, since the things so received are loved; moreover, those who thus receive, see these things in their understanding, where the sensation of their internal sight is. That this is so has been proven to me by much experience. It might also be elucidated by much rational argument; but the subject cannot just now be amplified so far.<p>It is here only necessary to say, that all names mentioned in the Word signify not persons but things; that "John," for instance, signifies such as are in the good of love, thus in the abstract the good of love itself. (That all names in the Word signify things may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2760.htm">2760</a>, and in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3934.htm">3934</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8581.htm">8581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10087.htm">10087</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 8 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>8. "Et significavit mittens per angelum suum servo suo Johanni." - Quod significet quae revelata e caelo illis qui in bono amoris sunt, constat ex significatione "significavit, ' quod sint illa quae in sensu litterae continentia ita significantia illa quae in sensu interno; dicitur enim, "Revelatio quam dedit Deus indicare, ... et significavit"; et per quae significavit, intelliguntur illa quae in sensu litterae sunt, quoniam omnia illa significant; et quae significantur sunt quae continentur in sensu interno; sunt enim omnia Verbi significativa spiritualium, quae in sensu interno: ex significatione "mittens per angelum suum", quod sint quae revelata e caelo; "mittere" enim est revelare, et "per angelum" est e caelo. <p>Quod "mittere" sit revelare est quia omne quod e caelo mittitur est revelatio, revelatur enim id quod ibi est, quod est spirituale concernens ecclesiam et ejus statum; sed hoc apud hominem<p>vertitur in naturale, quale est in sensu litterae in Apocalypsi et alibi in Verbo. Quod e caelo venit non aliter sisti potest apud hominem, cadit enim spirituale in suum correspondens naturale dum e spirituali mundo in naturalem: inde est quod Verbum Propheticum tale sit in sensu litterae; et quia tale est, quod in sinu suo sit spirituale, et quod sit Divinum. Quod per "angelum" intelligatur e caelo, est quia id quod angelus loquitur, e caelo est: angelus enim, cum loquitur cum homine talia quae caeli et ecclesiae sunt, non loquitur sicut homo cum homine qui profert ex memoria mandata alterius; sed apud angelum influit continue id quod loquitur, et non in memoriam ejus, sed immediate in intellectum et inde in voces. Inde est quod omnia quae angeli dixerunt prophetis Divina sint, et prorsus nihil ex angelis. Sive dicatur quod revelata sint e caelo, sive ex Domino, idem est, quoniam Divinum Domini apud angelos facit caelum, et prorsus nihil quod ex proprio angelorum; sed hoc constare melius potest ex illis quae in opere De Caelo et Inferno (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_8/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_2" target=_top>2-12</a>, et n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_8/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_254" target=_top>254</a>) dicta et ostensa sunt.<p>[2] Quod dicantur revelata e caelo illis qui in bono amoris sunt, est quia dicitur, "mittens per angelum suum servo suo Johanni", et per "Johannem" repraesentantur et intelliguntur illi qui in bono amoris sunt; per duodecim enim apostolos repraesentati et significati sunt omnes qui in ecclesia, qui in veris ex bono sunt, proinde etiam omnia vera ex bono ex quibus ecclesia, et singillatim per unumquemvis aliquid speciale; ut per "Petrum" fides, per "Jacobum" charitas, et per "Johannem" bonum charitatis seu bonum amoris; et quia Johannes hoc bonum repraesentavit, ideo revelatio illi facta est; nam revelatio e caelo, quae talis, non fieri potest aliis quam qui in bono charitatis seu amoris sunt. Alii quidem possunt audire illa quae e caelo, sed non percipere; solum illis est perceptio spiritualis qui in bono amoris sunt: causa est, quia recipiunt illa non modo auditu sed etiam amore, et recipere amore est recipere plene, quoniam amantur: et qui ita recipiunt, vident illa in suo intellectu; ibi est sensatio visus interni eorum. Quod ita sit, ex multa experientia mihi testatum factum est, et quoque potest multa ratione illustrari; sed eo usque nondum licet exspatiari. Hic modo memorandum est, quod omnia nomina, quae in Verbo, non significent personas, sed res; ut quod "Johannes" significet illos qui in bono amoris sunt, ita abstracte bonum amoris.
