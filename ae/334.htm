<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 334</h4><p>334.Verses 11, 12. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, the animals, and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands; saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and honour, and glory, and blessing.<p>"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, the animals, and the elders," signifies acknowledgment, and thence glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens; "and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands," signifies that those are innumerable who are in truths, and innumerable those who are in goods; "saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain," signifies acknowledgment from the heart that everything Divine is from the Lord's Divine Human not acknowledged, and by many denied; "to receive power, and riches, and wisdom," signifies that to Him belong omnipotence, omniscience, and Divine providence; "and honour, and glory," signifies that to Him belong Divine good and Divine truth; "and blessing," signifies the acknowledgment and glorification of the Lord on that account, and thanksgiving that from Him are all good and truth, and thence heaven and eternal happiness to those who receive them. </p>
