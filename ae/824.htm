<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 824</h4><p>824. (Verse 13) And he doeth great wonders. This signifies testifications and persuasions, as is evident from the signification of signs, as denoting testifications and persuasions (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/706.htm">706</a>). And because great is said of good, and, in the opposite sense, of evil, therefore by great signs are signified testifications and persuasions of falsity from evil. The reason why it is here said of the beast that "he did great wonders" is, that by the beast are signified confirmations from the Word in favour of faith separate from good works. And when reasonings from the natural man, signified by the first beast, are confirmed from the Word, then they not only testify but also persuade that a thing is so, and they do this because those who separate faith from good works are not willing that the intellectual sight should have any part in matters of faith, which they call mysteries; and when the intellectual sight is not present, they can persuade others to believe in whatever they please, even what every one from the mere light of nature may see to be false. Propose anything false, and declare it to be true, because it has been asserted by some eminent leader, who is believed by his followers to be enlightened or inspired, and take away the use of reason, and thus prevent the understanding from entering with any light, and you will see all things as true, and will be persuaded. The reason is, that the first proposition presented is believed, and is not first examined as to whether it be true or false.</p><p>[2] That it may be known that a falsity can be confirmed equally as a truth, take the most trifling example. For instance, make this ridiculous proposition, that a crow is white, and confirm it by these considerations, that a crow is not born altogether black, that it whitens as it grows old, that its feathers are white within, and also the skin, and thus its blackness is only a shade encompassing the white. Reason also in this way, that a man may indeed speak according to the outward appearance, that is, say it is black, but still that, being a man, he ought to think from the understanding that it is white, because it is so inwardly. Similarly it is allowable to speak of the sun's progression about the earth according to the outward appearance, as indeed it is stated in the Word, that is, that the sun rises and sets; but still that he ought to think from the understanding that the earth revolves on its axis, and causes that appearance. In addition to this there are reasonings from the nature of colours, that regarded in their origin are all white, because they are from the light of heaven, and also from this fact, that every colour when it is ground to a powder, even black crystal, becomes white, and on this subject cite the works of those authors who have written upon optics. Moreover, take away the use of reason, and assert that some man of authority and learning has witnessed the fact, and at the same time fix the mind on what is said in confirmation, and not on the first proposition, and possibly you will be enabled to persuade some one else. But this ridiculous proposition is here mentioned, because it is silly to judge of a bird from any other colour than its own, in which it appears; for thus all things in the world may be said to be white.</p><p>[3] It is similar with the falsities of heresies, as with that greatest of all, which was in Babylon, of which it is written in Daniel, that the king published an edict there that he should be worshipped as God. So also is it with reasonings from hell, they are employed by those who derive all things from nature, saying that nature created herself, and not God. And, if I may venture to say so, the case is the same with the faith called justifying faith, without the actual co-operation of the life. Such things are here meant by the great wonders which the beast did that came up out of the earth, which also caused fire to come down out of heaven on the earth before men, and deceived them that dwell on the earth, by means of those miracles which it was granted him to do before the beast, as is said in this and in the following verse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 824</h4><p>824. Verse 13. And he doeth great signs, signifies testifications and persuasions. This is evident from the signification of "signs," as being testifications and persuasions (See above, n. <a href="../ae/706.htm">706</a>); and as "great" is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, therefore "great signs" signify testifications and persuasions of falsity from evil. It is here said that the beast "did great signs," because "the beast" signifies confirmations from the Word in favor of faith separated from good works; and when reasonings from the natural man, which are signified by "the first beast," are confirmed from the Word, they both testify and persuade that it is so, and this for the reason that those who make this separation are not willing that the intellectual sight should have any part in matters of faith, which they call mysteries; and when the intellectual sight is not present they can persuade anything they please, even that which from the mere light of nature, anyone may see to be false. Propose any falsity, and declare it to be true because it has been said by some leader who is believed by his followers to be enlightened or inspired, and take away the use of reason, and thus prevent the entrance of the understanding with any light, and you will see all things as true, and will be persuaded; and for the reason that the primary proposition is believed without first investigating whether it is a truth or a falsity.</p><p>[2] That it may be known, that a falsity may be confirmed as easily as a truth, take this most trifling example: Lay down the ridiculous proposition that a crow is white, and confirm it as follows: that a crow is not born wholly black, that as it grows old it grows white, that its feathers are white within, and also its skin is white, and thus its blackness is only a shade surrounding the white parts, and reason further that man may indeed speak according to the appearance, that is, may say that it is black, and yet, since he is a man, he ought to think from his understanding that it is white, because it is inwardly white; just as it is allowable to speak of the sun's progression around the earth from appearance, and as in the Word also the sun is said to rise and set; and yet from his understanding one's thought must be that the earth revolves and causes that appearance. Add to this reasonings from the nature of colors, that they are all white in their origin, because they are from the light of heaven, also because every color when it is ground to a powder, even a black crystal, becomes white; and cite on this point those who have written on optics; and besides take away the use of reason, declaring that some man of authority and learning has seen this, and fix the mind on the confirmations, and not on the primary proposition, and it is possible that someone may be persuaded. But all this is ridiculous, because it is silly to conclude about a bird from any other color than its own, in which it appears; for thus all things in the world might be said to be white.</p><p>[3] It is similar with the falsities of heresies, as with that greatest of all that existed in Babylon, of which it is said in Daniel that the king published an edict there that he should be worshiped as God. It is similar with the reasonings, which are from hell, of those who declare that all things belong to nature, and even that nature created herself, and was not created by God; and if I may venture to say it, it is the same with the faith that is called justifying without an actual cooperation of the life. Such are the things here meant by "the great signs that the beast that came up out of the earth did, and made fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, and seduced them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs that were given him to do before the beast," as is said in this and the following verse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 824 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>824. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_824/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_13" target=_top>13</a>.] "Et facit signa magna." Quod significet testificationes et persuasiones, constat ex significatione "signorum", quod sint testificationes et persuasiones (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_824/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706" target=_top>706</a>); et quia "magnum" praedicatur de bono, et in opposito sensu de malo, inde per "signa magna" significantur testificationes et persuasiones falsi ex malo; quod hic de "bestia" dicatur quod "fecerit signa magna", est quia per illam significantur confirmationes ex Verbo pro fide separata a bonis operibus; et cum ratiocinia ex naturali homine, quae per "priorem bestiam" significantur, confirmantur ex Verbo, tunc non modo testificantur, sed etiam persuadent quod ita sit; et hoc ex causa, quia separatores illi non volunt ut visus intellectualis aliquam partem in rebus fidei, quas vocant mysteria, habeat; et cum visus intellectualis non adest, potest persuaderi quodcunque libet, etiam quod quisque ex solo Naturae lumine [potest] videre quod falsum sit.<p>[2] Propone aliquod falsum, et dic quod id verum sit, quia ab antesignano, qui ab asseclis creditur illustratus aut inspiratus, dictum est; et deme rationis usum, et sic inhibe ne intellectus luce aliqua intret; visurus es omnia sicut vera, et persuadeberis: causa est, quia prima propositio creditur, et non primum exploratur num illa verum sit vel falsum. Ut sciatur quod falsum aeque confirmari possit sicut verum, sit hoc levissimum exemplum: propone hoc ridiculosum, quod corvus albus sit, et confirma id per haec, quod corvus non nascatur prorsus niger, quod dum senescit albescat, quod pennae ejus interius albae sint, et quoque cutis, et quod sic nigredo sit modo umbra albis circuminducta; et ratiocinare quod homo quidem secundum aspectum possit loqui, nempe dicere quod sit niger, sed usque ex intellectu debeat cogitare, quia homo est, quod albus sit, quia interius albus est; sicut licet de solis progressione circum tellurem ex aspectu loqui, ut quoque dicitur in Verbo, quod nempe oriatur et occidat, sed usque debeat ex intellectu cogitare quod tellus se circumvolvat, et faciat illam apparentiam; adde ratiocinia ex coloribus, quod omnes albi sint ex origine, quia sunt ex luce caeli; et ex eo, quod omnis color, dum commolitur in pulverem, etiam crystallum nigrum, albus sit, de qua re cita auctores optices; insuper aufer rationis usum, et dic quod vir auctoritatis et eruditionis hoc viderit, et fige mentem in confirmationibus et non in prima propositione, forte erit qui persuadebitur: sed hoc ridiculosum dicitur, quia fatuum est avem ex alio colore quam ex suo, in quo apparet, judicare, sic enim omnia in mundo dicerentur alba.<p>[3] Simile est cum falsis haeresium, ut cum maxima illa, quae fuit in Babele, de qua apud Danielem, quod rex ibi indictum ederit, ut pro Deo coleretur; ut quoque est cum ratiociniis illorum, quae ex inferno sunt, quod omnia Naturae sint, immo quod Natura semet creaverit, et non Deus illam; et si ausim dicere, ita quoque est cum fide justificante absque actuali vitae cooperatione. Talia intelliguntur hic per "signa magna", quae fecit bestia e terra ascendens, et quae fecit ut ignis descenderit e caelo in terram coram hominibus, et seduxit habitantes super terra, propter signa quae data ei facere coram bestia, ut in hoc versu et in sequente dicitur. </p>
