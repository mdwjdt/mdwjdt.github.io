<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 17</h4><p>17. These approximate or general explanations of the preceding words, not being presented in a continuous series, will seem disconnected; this is the result of each expression being explained separately, and of the subjoining of the internal sense to the sense of the letter, which is different, each being immediately considered apart. This however, does not happen with the angels, who are in the internal sense. These do not see the sense of the letter, nor do they know anything about it, but the internal sense only; and because they see this in the light of heaven, they see it in such a series, in such connection, and also in such fulness and, consequently, in such wisdom, as, cannot be expressed and described by any human words. The ideas of angels, being spiritual, also conjoin all the contents in a wonderful manner, and embrace more things than a man can conceive or express by his ideas, which are natural, even as to the thousandth part. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 17</h4><p>17. These approximate or general explanations of the preceding words, not being presented in a continuous series, will appear disconnected; and this must be the case when each word or phrase is expounded separately, and the internal sense is immediately joined to the literal sense, which is diverse from it, and each is viewed by itself. But nevertheless, with angels, who are in the internal sense, this is not so. They do not see the sense of the letter, nor do they know anything about it; they see only the internal sense; and because they see this in the light of heaven, they see it in such a series and connection, and also in such abundance and thence in such wisdom, as cannot be expressed and described in human words. The ideas of angels, which are spiritual, also conjoin all things in a wonderful manner, and comprehend more than man can include or express in his ideas, which are natural, even as to a thousandth part thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 17 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>17. Explicationes proximae seu communes verborum praecedentium apparebunt sicut sparsae, quia non prolatae in continua serie, quod fit dum unumquodvis seorsim exponitur, et sensui litterae, qui alius est, sensus internus immediate submittitur, et unumquodvis spectatur separatim: at usque non ita fit ab angelis, qui in sensu interno sunt; hi non vident sensum litterae, nec sciunt aliquid de illo, sed modo sensum internum; quem quia vident in luce caeli, eum vident in tali serie, et in tali nexu, et quoque in tali copia, et inde in tali sapientia, ut non exprimi humanis vocibus et describi possit. Ideae angelorum, quae sunt spirituales, etiam mirabili modo conjungunt omnia, et comprehendunt plura quam homo potest quoad millesimam partem suis ideis, quae sunt naturales, complecti et effari. </p>
