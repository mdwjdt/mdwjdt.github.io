<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 275</h4><p>275. (Verse 6) And before the throne there was a glassy sea like unto crystal. That this signifies the appearance of truth in ultimates, in which are the general things thereof, translucent from the influx of Divine truth united to Divine good in primaries, is evident from the signification of before the throne, as being appearance; and from the signification of the sea as being the general things of truth, which will be explained in what follows; also from the signification of a sea of glass, as being translucence. It is said like unto crystal, in order to express translucence from the influx of Divine truth united to Divine good in primaries, which is signified by the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, as shown just above (n. <a href="../ae/274.htm">274</a>). In the preceding passages, and in this passage, the state of the whole heaven arranged in order for judgment, and its ultimate, is described by a glassy sea like unto crystal. The reason why the truth of the ultimate heaven is signified by a glassy sea is that sea signifies the general things of truth, such as truth is in the ultimates of heaven and pertaining to man in his natural state, which is called scientific truth (verum scientificum.)</p><p>[2] The reason why sea has such a signification is that in the sea there is a gathering together of waters; and waters signify truths, as may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">19:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_5.htm">5</a>).<p>By the Egyptians are signified the knowledges (scientiae) belonging to the natural man; by the cruel lord into whose hands they should be shut up is signified the evil of the love of self; by a fierce king is signified the falsity therefrom; by the waters of the sea failing is signified that notwithstanding the abundance of knowledges, there were no truths therefrom; and by the river being wasted and dried up, is signified that there was no doctrine of truth and consequently no intelligence.</p><p>[3] Again:<p>"Jehovah will visit with his sword, hard, great and strong, upon leviathan, the stretched out serpent, and upon leviathan the crooked serpent, and will slay the whales which are in the sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7293.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7293</a>.)</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>"The inhabitants of the isles are silent; the merchant of Zidon passing over the sea, they have filled thee. Blush O Zidon, because the sea hath said, The fortification of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, and I have not brought forth; I have not brought up young men, nor made the virgins to grow up; as with the report of Egypt, they shall be seized with pains at the report of Tyre" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_2.htm">23:2-5</a>).<p>By Zidon and Tyre are signified the knowledges (cognitiones) of good and truth, therefore reference is made to the merchant of Zidon passing over the sea, a merchant denoting one who procures to himself those knowledges, and imparts them. That they procured to themselves nothing of good and truth thereby, is signified by the sea, saying, "I have not travailed and brought forth, I have not brought up young men, nor made the virgins to grow up." To travail, and to bring forth, is to produce something from knowledges; young men signify truths, and virgins goods. That consequently the use of knowledges and of sciences (scientiae) would perish, is signified by, as with the report of Egypt, they shall be seized with pains at the report of Tyre.</p><p>[5] In Ezekiel:<p>"All the princes of the sea shall descend from upon their thrones, and shall cast away their robes, and put off their vestments of embroidery; they shall be clothed with terrors. They shall take up a lamentation over thee, and shall say, How hast thou perished, thou that wast inhabited by seas, the renowned city which was strong in the sea; wherefore the islands in the sea shall be troubled at thy destruction" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16-18</a>).<p>These things are said of Tyre, by which are signified the knowledges of truth, the neglect and loss of which are thus described. By the princes of the sea who shall come down from their thrones, are meant primary knowledges (cognitiones); that they shall be left together with scientifics is signified by their casting away their robes, and putting off their vestments of embroidery; the embroidery is the Scientific (Scientificum); the renowned city strong in the sea signifies the full power of knowing; the seas signify collections of scientifics (scientifica); the islands in the sea signify the nations more remote from truths which desire knowledges, concerning which it is said, "the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy destruction."</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>"They shall not do evil, nor corrupt themselves, in all the mountain of my holiness; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_11_9.htm">11:9</a>).<p>Here the subject treated of is a new heaven and a new church, which are meant by the mountain of holiness in which they shall not do evil nor corrupt themselves; their understanding of truth from the Lord is described by the earth being full of the knowledge (scientia) of Jehovah; and because waters signify truths, and the sea fulness of them, it is therefore said, "as the waters cover the sea."</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>"At my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness their fish shall be putrid, because there is no water, and shall die of thirst" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/108.htm">Arcana Coelestia 108</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3051.htm">3051</a>: that desert signifies where there is no good because no truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4736.htm">4736</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7055.htm">7055</a>; that fish signifies the Scientific of the natural man, n. <a href="../ae/40.htm">40</a>, <a href="../ae/991.htm">991</a>; that water signifies truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8568.htm">8568</a>, and that to die of thirst signifies the deprivation of spiritual life from defect of truth, n. 8568, end.)</p><p>[8] In David:<p>"Jehovah, thou rulest the raging of the sea, when the waves thereof arise" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_9.htm">Psalms 89:9</a>).<p>By sea is here signified the natural man, because in the natural man are the general things of truth; by the rising of its waves is signified its exalting itself against the Divine, denying the things of the church.</p><p>[9] Again:<p>"Jehovah hath founded" the world upon the seas, "and established it upon the rivers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_24_2.htm">Psalms 24:2</a>).<p>By the world is signified the church; by the seas the knowledges (cognitiones) in general which are in the natural man; and by rivers the truths of faith: upon both these the church is founded.</p><p>[10] In Amos:<p>Jehovah "who buildeth his steps in the heavens, and calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the faces of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_9_6.htm">9:6</a>).<p>By the steps which Jehovah buildeth in the heavens are signified interior truths, which are called spiritual; by the waters of the sea are signified exterior truths, which are natural because they are in the natural man; by pouring them out upon the faces of the earth, is signified upon the men of the church, for earth denotes the church.</p><p>[11] In David:<p>"By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap; he giveth the depths for treasures" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_33_6.htm">Psalms 33:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_33_7.htm">7</a>).<p>The Word of Jehovah by which the heavens were made, and the breath of His mouth by which all the host of them is made, signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; the host of the heavens denoting all things of love and faith. The waters of the sea which He gathered together as an heap signify the knowledges of truth, and truths in general, which are together in the natural man; the depths which He gives for treasures signify sensual scientifics (scientifica sensualia), which are the most general, and the ultimate of the natural man, and in which at the same time are interior or higher truths, whence they are called treasures.</p><p>[12] Again:<p>Jehovah "hath founded the earth upon its foundations that it be not removed to eternity and for ever. Thou hast covered it with the deep as with a garment" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_5.htm">Psalms 104:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_6.htm">6</a>).<p>By earth is here signified the church; the foundations on which Jehovah founded it for ever, are the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth and good. The deep which covered it as with a garment signifies the sensual Scientific, which is the ultimate of the natural man, and because it is such, Jehovah is said to have covered it as with a garment.</p><p>[13] Again:<p>Jehovah "thy way is in the sea, and thy path in many waters, yet thy footsteps are not known" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_19.htm">Psalms 77:19</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Thus saith Jehovah, I have made a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_16.htm">43:16</a>).<p>That by sea in this passage is not meant the sea, nor by waters are meant waters is evident, because it is said that therein are the way and the path of Jehovah. Therefore, by the sea and by waters are meant those things in which Jehovah or the Lord is, these being the knowledges of truth in general from the Word, and truths therein. The sea denotes those knowledges, and the waters truths. Knowledges (cognitiones) and truths differ in this, that the former are of the natural man, and the latter of the spiritual man.</p><p>[14] In Jeremiah:<p>"I will plead thy cause, and will avenge thy avenging: and I will dry up the sea" of Babel, "and will make dry the springs thereof; the sea shall come up upon Babel, she shall be covered with the multitude of its waves" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">51:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_42.htm">42</a>).<p>By Babel are meant those who profane goods; the sea of Babel signifies their traditions, which are adulterations of good from the Word; the waves are the falsities thereof; their destruction at the Last Judgment is described by these things.</p><p>[15] In the same:<p>"A people coming from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth. Their voice maketh a tumult like the sea, and they ride upon horses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_41.htm">50:41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_42.htm">42</a>).<p>The people coming from the north denote those who are falsities from evil; the great nation denotes evils, and many kings denote falsities; the sides of the earth denote the things of the church, and also those not of the church, for the earth denotes the church; their voice making a tumult like the sea, denotes falsity from the natural man exalting itself against the truth of the church; the horses upon which they ride, are reasonings from the fallacies of the senses.</p><p>[16] Again:<p>"Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light of the day, the statutes of the moon and of the stars for a light of the night, stirring up the sea so that the waves thereof are tumultuous" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">31:35</a>).<p>By the sun from which is the light of the day, is signified the good of celestial love, from which comes the perception of truth; by the ordinances of the moon and the stars, from which comes the light of the night, are signified truths from spiritual good and from knowledges, from which comes intelligence; by the sea which is stirred up, and by the waves which are tumultuous, are signified the generals of truth in the natural man, and scientifics.</p><p>[17] In Isaiah.<p>"The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_20.htm">57:20</a>).<p>By the troubled sea, which is said of the wicked, are signified reasonings from falsities; by the waters which cast up mire and dirt are signified the falsities themselves, from which come evils of life and falsities of doctrine.</p><p>[18] In Ezekiel:<p>"I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coasts" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_25_16.htm">25:16</a>).<p>By the Philistines are signified those who are in the doctrine of faith alone; and by the remnant of the sea coasts, which shall be destroyed, are signified all things pertaining to truth.</p><p>[19] In Hosea:<p>"I will not return to destroy Ephraim. They shall go after Jehovah; and with honour the sons shall draw near from the sea, with honour shall they come as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_11_9.htm">Hosea 11:9-11</a>).<p>By Ephraim is here signified the church as to the understanding of truth; by the sons from the sea who shall draw near are signified truths from their common fount, which is the Word; by a bird out of Egypt is signified the Scientific in agreement therewith; and by a dove out of the land of Assyria is signified the Rational.</p><p>[20] In Zechariah:<p>"In that day living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, part of them to the eastern sea, and part of them to the hinder sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">14:8</a>).<p>By living waters going out from Jerusalem are signified truths from a spiritual origin in the church, which are the truths received by man when he is enlightened from the Lord while reading the Word; Jerusalem signifies the church as to doctrine. By the sea is signified the natural man into which those things descend that are in the spiritual man; by the eastern sea is signified the natural man as to good, and by the hinder sea the same as to truth; and because the natural man is in the general things of truth, therefore by sea are also signified things of truth.</p><p>[21] Those who are ignorant of what is meant by the spiritual man, and by the truths and goods therein, may suppose that the truths that are in the natural man, and are called knowledges and scientifics, are not merely the generals of truth, but that they are all things of truth pertaining to man. But be it known that the truths that are in the spiritual man, and from which those that are in the natural are derived, exceed them enormously. Those, however, that are in the spiritual man do not come within the perception of the natural man until he enters the spiritual world, which is after death; for then man puts off the natural, and puts on the spiritual. That this is the case is evident from this fact only, that the angels are in intelligence and wisdom ineffable in comparison with man, and yet the angels are all from the human race. (That the angels are from the human race may be seen in the small work, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>). For washing represented purifications from falsities and evils, and waters signify truths, by which purifications are effected. And because all truths are from good, therefore the whole vessel was made of brass; therefore it was called the brazen sea, for brass signifies good. Spiritual purification, which is purification from falsities and evils, is there fully described by the measurements of that vessel, and by the bases thereof, understood in the spiritual sense. From the considerations now adduced, it is evident that by sea are signified the generals of truth, or the knowledges of truth together and collectively. But what is further signified by the sea will be shown in the explanation of the following part of this book. For the sea is mentioned in various senses; as in chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_13.htm">5:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_1.htm">7:1-3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_8.htm">8:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_10_2.htm">10:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_10_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_7.htm">14:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_2.htm">15:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_3.htm">16:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_17.htm">18:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_13.htm">20:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 275</h4><p>275. Verse 6. And in sight of the throne a glassy sea like crystal, signifies the appearance of [Divine] truth in ultimates where its generals are, and its pellucidity by virtue of the influx of Divine truth united to Divine good in firsts. This is evident from the signification of "in sight of the throne," as being appearance; also from the signification of "glassy," as being pellucid. It is also said "like crystal," that pellucidity from the influx of Divine truth united to Divine good in firsts may be described; this is signified by "the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne" (as shown just above, n. <a href="../ae/274.htm">274</a>. In this and what precedes, the state of the whole heaven arranged in order for judgment is described, and its ultimate is meant by "the glassy sea like crystal." The truth of the ultimate heaven is signified by "a glassy sea" because "sea" signifies the generals of truth, such truth as exists in the ultimates of heaven, and with man in the natural man, which truth is called knowledge [scientificum]. The "sea" signifies such truths because in the sea is the gathering together of waters, and "waters" signify truths (See above, n. <a href="../ae/71.htm">71</a>).</p><p>[2] That this is the signification of "sea" is evident from many passages in the Word, a number of which I will cite here. In Isaiah:<p>I will shut up the Egyptians into the land of a hard lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them. Then the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall dry up and become dry (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>, (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>)).<p>By "the Egyptians" knowledges [scientiae] that are of the natural man are meant; "the hard lord into whose hands they should be shut up" signifies the evil of self-love; "a fierce king" signifies falsity therefrom; "the waters shall fail from the sea" signifies that with all the abundance of knowledges [scientiarum] there still are no truths; and "the river shall dry up and become dry" signifies that there is no doctrine of truth and no intelligence therefrom.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>Jehovah will visit with His sword, hard, great, and strong, upon leviathan the stretched out serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent, and will slay the whales that are in the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7293.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7293</a>.)</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>Let the inhabitants of the isle be still; thou merchant of Zidon passing over the sea, they have filled thee. Blush, O Zidon, for the sea hath said, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, and I have not brought forth, and I have not brought up young men, and have not raised up virgins; when the report comes to Egypt they shall be seized with grief, as by the report respecting Tyre (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_2.htm">Isaiah 23:2-5</a>).<p>"Zidon" and "Tyre" signify the knowledges of good and truth; therefore it is said "the merchant of Zidon passing over the sea," "merchant" meaning one who acquires these knowledges for himself and communicates them. That they acquired for themselves thereby nothing of good and truth is signified by "the sea said, I have not travailed and I have not brought forth, I have not brought up young men, and have not raised up virgins;" "to travail and bring forth" is to produce something from knowledges; "young men" mean truths, and "virgins" goods. That the use of cognitions and knowledges (cognitionum et scientiarum) would therefore perish, is signified by "when the report comes to Egypt they shall be seized with grief, as by the report respecting Tyre."</p><p>[5] In Ezekiel:<p>All the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and cast away their robes, and strip off their broidered garments, they shall be clothed with terrors. They shall take up a lamentation over thee, and shall say, How hast thou perished, thou that dwelt by the seas, the renowned city which was strong in the sea; therefore the islands in the sea shall be dismayed at thy outcome (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15-18</a>).<p>These things are said of "Tyre," which signifies the cognitions of truth, the neglect and loss of which are thus described; the "princes of the sea that shall come down from their thrones" signify primary cognitions; that these together with knowledges [scientificis] shall be abandoned is signified by "they shall cast away their robes, and strip off their broidered garments;" "broidered work," is knowledges [scientificum]; "the city that dwelt by the seas and was strong in the sea" signifies the power of knowing in all abundance ("seas" signify collections); "the islands in the sea" signify nations more remote from truths that long for cognitions, of which it is said "therefore the islands in the sea shall be dismayed at thy outcome."</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>They shall not do evil nor corrupt themselves in all the mountain of My holiness; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge [scientifia] of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>).<p>This treats of a new heaven and a new church, which are meant by "mountain of holiness," in which "they shall not do evil nor corrupt themselves;" their understanding of truth from the Lord is described by "the earth shall be full of the knowledge [scientia] of Jehovah; "and as waters" signify truths, and the "sea" the fullness of them, it is said, "as the waters cover the sea."</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>By My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish shall become putrid because there is no water, and shall die of thirst (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/108.htm">108</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">2702[1-17]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2702</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2702[1-17]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3051.htm">3051</a>; that "wilderness" signifies where there is no good because there is no truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4736.htm">4736</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7055.htm">7055</a>; that "fish" signifies the knowledge [scientificum] pertaining to the natural man, n. <a href="../ae/40.htm">40</a>, <a href="../ae/991.htm">991</a>; that "water" signifies truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8568.htm">8568</a>; and that "to die of thirst" signifies the absence of spiritual life from lack of truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8568.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8568</a>[1-10].</p><p>[8] In David:<p>O Jehovah, Thou rulest in the uprising of the sea; when it raiseth up its waves (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_9.htm">Psalms 89:9</a>).<p>The "sea" here signifies the natural man, because in the natural man are the generals of truth; "the uprising of the sea" signifies its exalting itself against the Divine, denying the things that are of the church; the "waves" which it raiseth up signify falsities.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>Jehovah hath founded the world upon the seas, and established it upon the rivers (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_24_2.htm">Psalms 24:2</a>).<p>The "world" signifies the church; the "seas" knowledges in general which are in the natural man; and "rivers" the truths of faith; upon these two the church has its foundation.</p><p>[10] In Amos:<p>Jehovah, who buildeth His steps in the heavens, and calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the faces of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_9_6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>).<p>"The steps that Jehovah buildeth in the heavens" signify interior truths which are called spiritual; "the waters of the sea" signify exterior truths, which are natural because they are in the natural man; "to pour them out upon the faces of the earth" signifies upon the men of the church, for the "earth" is the church.</p><p>[11] In David:<p>By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made; and all the hosts of them by the breath of His mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap; He giveth the deeps in treasuries (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_33_6.htm">Psalms 33:6-7</a>).<p>"The word of Jehovah by which the heavens were made," and "the breath of His mouth by which all the hosts of them were made," signify Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; "the hosts of the heavens" are all things of love and faith; "the waters of the sea that He gathereth together as an heap" signify the knowledges of truth, and truths in general, which are together in the natural man; "the deeps that He gives in treasuries" signify sensual knowledges [scientifica sensualia], which are the most general and ultimate things of the natural man, and in which at the same time are interior or higher truths, therefore they are called "treasures."</p><p>[12] In the same:<p>Jehovah hath founded the earth upon its bases, that it be not removed for ever and ever. Thou hast covered it with the deep as with a vesture (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_5.htm">Psalms 104:5-6</a>).<p>The "earth" signifies the church; "the bases on which Jehovah hath founded it for ever" are the knowledges of truth and good; "the deep with which He hath covered it as with a vesture" signifies sensual knowledge [scientificum sensuale], which is the ultimate of the natural man, and being the ultimate, it is said that "He covered it as with a vesture."</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>Jehovah, Thy way is in the sea, and Thy path in many waters, yet Thy footsteps have not been known (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_19.htm">Psalms 77:19</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Thus saith Jehovah, I who have given a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>).<p>That "sea" here does not mean the sea, nor "waters" the waters, is clear, since it is said that therein "are the way and the path of Jehovah;" therefore by "sea" and by "waters" are meant such things as Jehovah or the Lord is in, which are the knowledges of truth in general from the Word, and the truths therein; "the sea" being such knowledges, and "waters" truths. Knowledges and truths differ in this, that knowledges are of the natural man, and truths of the spiritual man.</p><p>[14] In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, I will plead thy cause, and will revenge thy revenging; that I may dry up the sea of Babylon, and make dry her fountain. The sea shall come up upon Babylon, she shall be covered with the multitude of its waves (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_42.htm">42</a>).<p>By "Babylon" those who profane goods are meant; "the sea of Babylon" means their traditions, which are the adulterations of good from the Word; "the waves" are the falsities from these; their destruction at the Last Judgment is hereby described.</p><p>[15] In the same:<p>A people coming from the north, and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth. Their voice maketh a tumult like the sea, and they ride upon horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_41.htm">Jeremiah 50:41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_42.htm">42</a>).<p>"A people coming from the north" are those who are in falsities from evil; "the great nation" means evils; and "many kings" falsities; "the sides of the earth" are the things outside of the church, and those that are not of the church, for the "earth" means the church; "their voice maketh a tumult like the sea" means falsity from the natural man exalting itself against the truth of the church; "the horses upon which they ride" are reasonings from the fallacies of the senses.</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>Jehovah giveth the sun for light by day, the statutes of the moon and stars for light by night, stirring up the sea so that the waves thereof roar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>).<p>"The sun from which is the light of day" signifies the good of celestial love, from which is the perception of truth; "the statutes of the moon and stars, from which is the light of night," signify truths from spiritual good and from knowledges, by which there is intelligence; "the sea that is stirred up, and the waves that roar," signify the generals of truth in the natural man, and knowledges [scientifica].</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot be quiet, but its waters cast up filth and mire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>).<p>"The troubled sea which is like the wicked," signifies reasonings from falsities; "the waters that cast up filth and mire," signify the falsities themselves, from which come evils of life and falsities of doctrine.</p><p>[18] In Ezekiel:<p>I will stretch out Mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_25_16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>).<p>"The Philistines" signify those who are in the doctrine of faith alone, and "the remnant of the sea coast that shall be destroyed," signifies all things of truth.</p><p>[19] In Hosea:<p>I will not return to destroy Ephraim. They shall go after Jehovah; and the sons from the sea shall draw near with honor, with honor shall they come as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_11_9.htm">Hosea 11:9-11</a>).<p>"Ephraim" signifies the church in respect to the understanding of truth; "the sons from the sea, who shall draw near," signify truths from a common fountain, which is the Word; "a bird out of Egypt" signifies knowledge [scientificum] agreeing; and "a dove out of the land of Assyria" signifies the rational.</p><p>[20] In Zechariah:<p>In that day living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; part of them to the eastern sea, and part of them to the hinder sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>).<p>"Living waters from Jerusalem" signify truths from a spiritual origin in the church, which are the truths that are received by man when he is illustrated by the Lord while he is reading the Word. "Jerusalem" is the church in respect to doctrine, the "sea" signifies the natural man, into which those things that are in the spiritual man descend; the "eastern sea" signifies the natural man in respect to good; and the "hinder sea" the natural man in respect to truth; and as the natural man is in the generals of truth, "sea" also signifies the general of truth.</p><p>[21] He who knows nothing about the spiritual man, and the truths and goods that are therein, may suppose that the truths that are in the natural man, and are called cognitions and knowledges [scientifica] are not merely the generals of truth, but are all there is of truth with man. But let him know that the truths in the spiritual man, from which those are that are in the natural, are incomparably more numerous; but these truths in the spiritual man do not come to the perception of the natural man until he enters the spiritual world, which is after death; for then man puts off the natural and puts on the spiritual. That this is so can be seen from this fact alone, that angels are in intelligence and wisdom ineffable as compared with man, and yet they are from the human race. (That angels are from the human race, see in The small work on <a href="../lj/14.htm">The Last Judgment 14-22</a> and <a href="../lj/23.htm">23-27</a>)</p><p>[22] As the "sea" signifies the generals of truth, therefore the great vessel, which was for general washing, was called "the brazen sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>); for the "washings" represented purifications from falsities and evils, and "waters" signify truths, by which purifications are effected; and as all truths are from good, the containing vessel was made of brass, and was therefore called "the barren sea," for brass signifies good. Spiritual purification, which is called purification from falsities and evils, is there fully described by the measurements of that vessel, and by the bases thereof, understood in a spiritual sense. From what has been brought forward it can be seen that "sea" signifies the generals of truth or the knowledges of truth together and collectively. But what further is signified by "sea" will be shown in the explanation of what follows, for "sea" is used in various senses (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_1.htm">7:1-3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_8.htm">8:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_10_2.htm">10:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_10_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_7.htm">14:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_2.htm">15:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_3.htm">16:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_17.htm">18:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_13.htm">20:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1</a>). </p>

"Et in conspectu throni mare vitreum simile crystallo." - Quod significet apparentiam (Divini) Veri in ultimis, ubi communia ejus, et pellucentiam ab influxu Divini Veri uniti Divino Bono in primis, constat ex significatione "in conspectu throni", quod sit apparentia; ex significatione "maris", quod sint communia veri (de qua sequitur); ex significatione "vitrei", quod sit pellucentia; dicitur etiam "simile crystallo", ut exprimatur pellucentia ex influxu Divini Veri uniti Divino Bono in primis, qui significatur per "septem lampadas ignis ardentes coram throno", ut mox supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_274" target=_top>274</a>) ostensum est. Describitur in praecedentibus usque ad haec status universi caeli ordinati ad judicium, ac ultimum ejus per "mare vitreum simile crystallo": quod sit verum ultimi caeli, quod per "mare vitreum" significatur, est quia "mare" significat communia veri, quale verum est in ultimis caeli, et apud hominem in naturali homine, quod verum scientificum vocatur; quod "mare" illa significet, est quia in mari est congregatio aquarum, et per "aquas" significantur vera (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_71" target=_top>71</a>).<p>[2] Quod "mare" illa significet, constat a pluribus locis in Verbo, quorum aliquam copiam volo adducere:<p>- Apud Esaiam,<p>"Concludam Aegyptios in manum domini duri, et rex Vehemens dominabitur in eos;... tunc deficient aquae a mari, et fluvius exsiccabitur et exarescet" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_19_4" target=_top>19:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_19_5" target=_top>5</a>);<p>per "Aegyptios" significantur scientiae quae naturalis hominis; per "dominum durum" in cujus manum concludentur, significatur malum amoris sui; per "regem vehementem" significatur falsum inde; per quod "deficient aquae ex mari", significatur quod ex omni copia scientiarum usque non vera; et per quod "fluvius exsiccabitur et exarescet", significatur quod nulla doctrina veri, et inde nulla intelligentia.<p>[3] Apud eundem,<p>"Visitabit Jehovah gladio suo duro, magno et forti, super leviathanem serpentem oblongum, et super leviathanem serpentem tortuosum, et occidet cetos qui in mari" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_27_1" target=_top>27:1</a>);<p>haec quoque de Aegypto, per quam significantur scientiae quae naturalis hominis; per "leviathanem serpentem oblongum" significantur illi qui rejiciunt omnia quae non oculis vident, ita mere sensuales, qui absque fide sunt quia non comprehendunt; per "leviathanem serpentem tortuosum" significantur qui ideo non credunt et usque dicunt se credere; per "gladium durum, magnum et fortem", quo visitabuntur, significatur exstinctio omnis veri, "gladius" enim est falsum destruens verum; per "cetos in mari" qui occidentur, significantur scientifica in communi.

"urbs habitata a maribus, et valida in mari", significat cognitivum in omni copia ("maria" significant collectiones); "insulae in mari" significant gentes remotiores a veris, quae desiderant cognitiones;

"aquae maris" quas "colligit in cumulum", significant cognitiones veri ac vera in communi, quae simul sunt in naturali homine; "abyssi" quas "dat in thesauris", significant scientifica sensualia, quae sunt communissima et ultima naturalis hominis, et in quibus simul sunt vera interiora seu superiora; inde vocantur illa "thesauri."</p><p>[12] Apud eundem,<p>Jehovah "fundavit terram super basibus ejus, ut non dimoveatur in aeternum et in perpetuum; abysso sicut veste obvelasti eam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_104_5" target=_top>Psalms 104:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_104_6" target=_top>6</a>);<p>per "terram" significatur ecclesia; "bases" super quibus Jehovah "fundavit eam in aeternum", sunt cognitiones veri et boni; "abyssus" quae "sicut veste obvelavit eam", est scientificum sensuale quod est ultimum naturalis hominis; et quia est ultimum, dicitur "sicut Veste obvelavit."</p><p>[13] Apud eundem,<p>Jehovah, "in mari via tua, et semita tua in aquis multis, vestigia tamen tua non nota sunt" (Psalms 77:20 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_77_19" target=_top>19</a>]);<p>apud Esaiam,<p>Sic dixit Jehovah, Qui dedi in mari viam, et in aquis validis semitam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_43_16" target=_top>43:16</a>):<p>quod per "mare" hic non intelligatur mare, nec per "aquas" intelligantur aquae, patet, quia dicitur quod ibi "Jehovae via et semita"; quare per "mare" et per "aquas" intelliguntur talia in quibus est Jehovah seu Dominus, quae sunt cognitiones veri in communi ex Verbo, et vera ibi; "mare" sunt illae cognitiones, et "aquae" sunt vera: cognitiones et vera in eo differunt, quod cognitiones sint naturalis hominis, et vera spiritualis.</p><p>[14] Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Ecce Ego litigans litem tuam, et ulciscar ultionem tuam, ut exsiccem mare Babelis, "et arefaciam scaturiginem ejus: .... ascendet super Babelem mare, multitudine fluctuum suorum obtecta erit" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_36" target=_top>51:36</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_42" target=_top>42</a>);<p>per "Babelem" intelliguntur qui profanant bona; "mare Babelis" sunt traditiones eorum, quae sunt adulterationes boni ex Verbo; "fluctus" sunt falsa eorum; destructio eorum quando ultimum judicium describitur per illa verba.</p><p>[15] Apud eundem,<p>"Populus veniens a septentrione, et gens magna, et reges multi excitabuntur a lateribus terrae;.... vox eorum sicut mare tumultuatur, et super equis equitant" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_1-46" target=_top>50</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_41" target=_top>41</a>,] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_42" target=_top>42</a>);<p>"populus veniens a septentrione" sunt qui in falsis ex malo, "gens magna" sunt mala, et "reges multi" sunt falsa; "latera terrae" sunt quae extra ecclesiam et quae non sunt ecclesiae, "terra" enim est ecclesia; "vox eorum sicut mare tumultuatur", est falsum e naturali homine se efferens contra verum ecclesiae; "equi super quibus equitant", sunt ratiocinia ex fallaciis sensuum.</p><p>[16] Apud eundem,<p>"Jehovah dans solem in lucem diei, statuta lunae et stellarum in lucem noctis, commovens mare ut tumultuentur fluctus ejus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_35" target=_top>31:35</a>);<p>per "solem" ex quo "lux diei", significatur bonum amoris caelestis ex quo perceptio veri; per "statuta lunae et stellarum" ex quibus "lux noctis", significantur vera ex bono spirituali, et ex cognitionibus, a quibus intelligentia; per "mare" quod commovetur, et per "fluctus" qui tumultuantur, significantur communia veri in naturali homine, et scientifica.</p><p>[17] Apud Esaiam,<p>"Impii sicut mare impulsum, quando quiescere non potest, sed ejiciunt aquae ejus caenum et lutum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_57_20" target=_top>57:20</a>);<p>per "mare impulsum" quod impiis, significantur ratiocinia ex falsis; per "aquas" quae "ejiciunt caenum et lutum", significantur ipsa falsa, ex quibus mala vitae et falsa doctrinae.</p><p>[18] Apud Ezechielem,<p>"Extendam manum meam super Philisthaeos, et exscindam Kerethaeos, et perdam reliquias litoris maris" ( <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_25_16" target=_top>25:16</a>);<p>per "Philisthaeos" significantur qui in doctrina de sola fide;

per "filios a mari" qui accedent, significantur vera ex communi fonte, qui est Verbum; per "avem ex Aegypto", significatur scientificum concordans; et per "columbam ex terra Assyriae", significatur rationale.</p><p>[20] Apud Sachariam,<p>"In die illa exibunt aquae vivae ex Hierosolyma, pars earum ad mare orientale, et pars earum ad mare posterius" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_14_18" target=_top>14:18</a> <sup>2</sup></p><p>);<p>per "aquas vivas ex Hierosolyma" significantur vera ex spirituali origine in ecclesia, quae vera sunt quae recipiuntur ab homine quando est in illustratione a Domino cum legit Verbum; "Hierosolyma" est ecclesia quoad doctrinam; per "mare" significatur naturalis homo, in quem descendunt illa quae sunt in spirituali; per "mare orientale" significatur naturalis homo quoad bonum, et per "mare posterius" naturalis homo quoad verum; et quia naturalis homo est in communibus veri, ideo per "mare" etiam communia veri significantur.</p><p>[21] Qui non scit aliquid de spirituali homine, ac de veris et bonis quae ibi, opinari potest quod vera quae in naturali homine, et Vocantur cognitiones et scientifica, non sint communia veri, sed omnia Veri quae apud hominem; at sciat quod vera in spirituali homine, ex quibus illa quae in naturali, immenso numero excedant; sed illa quae in spirituali homine non ad perceptionem naturalis hominis perveniunt quam cum in spiritualem mundum venit, quod fit post mortem; tunc enim homo exuit naturale et induit spirituale: quod ita sit, constare potest solum ex eo, quod angeli sint in intelligentia et sapientia ineffabili prae homine, et tamen angeli sunt ex humano genere. (Quod Angeli sint ex Humano Genere, videatur in opusculo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_14" target=_top>De Ultimo Judicio 14-22</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_23" target=_top>23-27</a>.)</p><p>[22] Quia "mare" significat communia veri, ideo vas magnum, quod pro communi lavatione, vocabatur<p>"mare aeneum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_7_23-26" target=_top>1 Regnum 7:23-26</a>);<p>avationes enim repraesentabant purificationes a falsis et malis, et "aquae" significant vera per quae purificationes fiunt: et quia omnia vera sunt ex bono, ideo continens ejus erat aes; unde vocatum est "mare aeneum", "aes" enim significat bonum. Purificatio spiritualis, quae est purificatio a falsis et malis, describitur ibi plene per mensuras illius vasis, et per bases ejus, intellectas in sensu spirituali. Ex his quae adducta sunt, constare potest quod per "mare" significentur communia veri, seu cognitiones veri simul et collectim.
