<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1165</h4><p>1165. And saying, Woe, woe, that great city.- That this signifies lamentation over doctrine; and over religion, is evident from the explanation of similar words above (n. <a href="../ae/1134.htm">1134</a>). Woe, woe, signifies lamentation, when it is said, Woe, that city; but it signifies cursing when it is said, Woe, to that city.<p>Continuation.- Experience can further testify to the same purpose. All who come from the earth into the spiritual world are known as to their quality, from their ability or inability to resist evils as if from themselves. Those who can do so are saved, but not so those who cannot. The reason is, that man cannot resist evils of himself, but from the Lord; for it is the Lord who resists evils with man, causing him to feel and perceive as if he did this from himself. Those, therefore, who in the world acknowledged the Lord, confessing that all good and truth are from Him, and nothing from man, and thus that they have power against evils from the Lord, and not from themselves, resist evils as if from themselves. But those who made no such acknowledgment in the world cannot resist evils as from themselves, for they are in evils, and in the delight of them from their love; and to resist the delight of their love is to resist themselves, their own nature and their own life. The experiment was tried whether they could resist evils, while the punishments of hell were being recounted to them, indeed while they were seen and felt, but it was all in vain. They hardened their hearts, saying, "Come what will, provided we are only in the delights and joys of our hearts as long as we are here. We know what the present is; as to the future we give no thought to that. We shall not suffer more evil than many, many others." But after a certain time they are cast into hell, where by means of punishments they are compelled not to do evil. Punishments, however, do not take away the will, the intention, and consequent thought of evil; they merely prevent the act. From these considerations it is evident that resistance to evils does not originate with man, but with the Lord in the case of those who acknowledge Him; and that He causes it to appear as if it proceeded from themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1165</h4><p>1165. Verse 16. And saying, Woe, woe, that great city, signifies lamentation over their doctrine and religious persuasion, as is evident from the explanation of like words above (n. <a href="../ae/1134.htm">1134</a>). "Woe, woe," signifies lamentation when it is said, "Woe that city," but it signifies cursing when it is said, "Woe to that city."<p>(Continuation)<p>Let experience testify further on this subject. The quality of all who come from the earth into the spiritual world is known from their ability or inability to resist evils as if from themselves. Those who are able to do this are saved, while those who are not able are not saved. The reason is that man is not able to resist evils from himself, but only from the Lord; for it is the Lord who resists evils in man and gives man to feel and perceive as if he does it from himself. Therefore those in the world who have acknowledged the Lord, and have acknowledged that all good and truth are from Him, and that nothing is from man, and thus that power over evils is from the Lord, and not from themselves, such resist evils as if from themselves. But those who have not acknowledged this in the world are unable to resist evils as if from themselves, for such are in evils and in the delight of evils from love; and to resist the delight of love is the same as resisting themselves, their own nature, and their own life. An experiment was made whether such were able to resist evils when the punishments of hell were described to them, and even when those punishments were seen and were felt; but it was in vain; for they hardened their minds, saying, Let this be so, and let it come, but so long as I am here let me be in the pleasures and joys of my heart. The present I know; what is to come I give no thought to; no more evil will come to me than to very many others. Such when their time is fulfilled are cast into hell; and there they are compelled by punishments to refrain from doing evil; but punishments do not take away the will, intention, and consequent thought of evil; they merely take away the acts. All this makes clear that the power to resist evils is not from man, but is from the Lord with those who acknowledge Him, and that the Lord causes it to appear as if done by man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1165 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1165. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1165/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_16" target=_top>16</a>.] "Et dicentes, Vae, vae, urbs illa magna." - Quod significet lamentationem super doctrinam et super religiosum, constat ex illis quae supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1165/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1134" target=_top>1134</a>), explicata sunt, ubi similia verba. "Vae, vae", significat lamentationem cum dicitur "Vae, urbs illa"; at significat maledictionem cum dicitur "Vae, urbi illi."<p>(Continuatio.)<p>Testetur rem adhuc experientia. Omnes qui in mundum spiritualem e terris veniunt, cognoscuntur quales sunt ex eo, num possint resistere malis sicut a se ipsis, vel num id non possint; illi qui possunt, salvantur, illi autem qui non possunt, non salvantur. Causa est, quia resistere malis non potest homo ex se, sed ex Domino; Dominus enim est qui malis apud hominem resistit, et facit ut homo sentiat et percipiat sicut id faciat ex se: qui itaque in mundo a noverunt Dominum, et quoque quod omne bonum et verum sit abso et nihil ab homine, et sic quod a Domino valeant contra mala, et non a semet, illi resistunt malis sicut a se: at qui illa in mundo non agnoverant, illi non possunt resistere malis sicut a se; sunt enim in malis, et ex amore in jucundo illorum, ac jucundo amoris resistere, est sibi, suae naturae, et suae vitae. Expertum est num possent, dum poenae inferni illis narratae sunt, immo dum visae, et quoque sentitae, sed usque in vanum; obfirmarunt animum, dicentes, Sit hoc et fiat hoc, modo sim in cordis mei delectamentis et gaudiis quamdiu hic sum; praesentia scio, futura non cogito, non mihi fit plus mali quam multis et multis aliis: sed illi post exactum tempus conjiciuntur in infernum, ubi coguntur a malis faciendis per poenas; at poenae non auferunt voluntatem, intentionem et inde cogitationem mali; auferunt modo actus. Ex his patet quod resistere malis non sit ab homine, sed a Domino apud illos qui agnoscunt Ipsum, et quod Dominus det ut appareat sicut fiat ab illis. </p>
