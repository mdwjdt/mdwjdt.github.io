<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 752</h4><p>752. Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea.- That this signifies lamentation over those who become merely natural and sensual, is plain from the signification of woe, as denoting lamentation (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/531.htm">531</a>); and from the signification of those that inhabit the earth and the sea, as denoting the merely natural and sensual. For as those who dwell in the heavens signify the spiritual, so those that inhabit the earth and the sea signify the natural and sensual, the natural and sensual mind being beneath the spiritual mind, as the earth and sea are beneath the heavens. And also in the spiritual world the heavens appear on high (in editis), and far off beneath them lands and seas appear; and the spiritual dwell in the heavens, while on the lands far off beneath them dwell the natural; and the sensual dwell in the seas. For every one dwells on high, or deeply beneath (alte et profunde), according as his interiors, which are called the interiors of the mind, are opened or closed. For this reason, heaven and earth, in certain passages of the Word, signify the internal and external church, or the spiritual and natural church; also specifically, the spiritual and natural man, because the church is in man, and therefore the man who is spiritual is a church. Here the earth and the sea signify those who are merely natural and sensual, because the earth here means that earth unto which the dragon was cast, and to which the devil came down, as will be seen in what follows. This is where the merely natural or external man is, for the natural man without the spiritual, or the external man without the internal, is upon land that is damned, under which is hell. For man is born sensual and natural, that is, as it were in hell, because born into evils of every kind, but through regeneration he becomes spiritual, and by that means he is withdrawn from hell and raised up into heaven by the Lord. This is the reason of this lamentation over those who are merely natural and sensual. There is lamentation over them, because those are meant who are in faith separated from charity, thus those who say that they are in faith, although they have no life of faith; and that such become merely natural and sensual has been shown above (n. <a href="../ae/714.htm">714</a>, <a href="../ae/739.htm">739</a>). These are also meant by the dragon and his angels, and by the old serpent, but here those who suffer themselves to be easily led astray by the dragon and his angels are meant. It is these, therefore, of whom it is said, "Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea." That heaven and earth signify the internal church, which is spiritual, and the external church which is natural, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>). That the earth also signifies damnation (n. <a href="../ae/742.htm">742</a>); that seas signify the most exterior things of the life of man, which are called sensual (n. <a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>, <a href="../ae/511.htm">511</a>); that they also signify the hells (n. <a href="../ae/537.htm">537</a>, <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 752</h4><p>752. Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, signifies lamentation over those who become merely natural and sensual. This is evident from the signification of "woe," as being lamentation (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/531.htm">531</a>); also from the signification of "those that inhabit the earth and the sea," as being the merely natural and sensual; for as "those that dwell in the heavens" signify the spiritual, so "those that inhabit the earth and the sea" signify the natural and sensual, for the natural and sensual mind is beneath the spiritual mind, as the earth and sea are beneath the heavens. So also in the spiritual world the heavens appear on high, and far beneath them appear lands and seas; and the spiritual dwell in the heavens, while the natural dwell upon the earths far beneath them, and the sensual in the seas. For everyone has his dwelling place on high or in the deep, as his interiors, which are called interiors of the mind, are opened or closed. For this reason "heaven and earth" in certain passages in the Word signify the church internal and external, or spiritual or natural; also in particular the spiritual and the natural man, since the church is in man, and thence the man who is spiritual is a church. Here "the earth and the sea" signify the merely natural and sensual, because the earth here means the earth into which the dragon was cast out, and unto which the devil came down, as is next said. That is where the merely natural or external man is, since the natural man without the spiritual, or the external man without the internal, is upon the land that is condemned, under which is hell. For man is born sensual and natural, that is, as if in hell, because into evils of every kind; but by regeneration he becomes spiritual, and by it he is drawn out of hell and raised up into heaven by the Lord. This is why this lamentation is over those who are merely natural and sensual. There is lamentation over them because those are meant who are in faith separated from charity, that is, who say that they have faith and yet have no life of faith; and that such become merely natural and sensual has been shown above (n. <a href="../ae/714.htm">714</a>, <a href="../ae/739.htm">739</a>); such also are meant by "the dragon and his angels" and by "the old serpent," but here those are meant who permit themselves to be easily led astray by the dragon and his angels. It is of such, therefore, that it is said, "Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea." (That "heaven and earth" signify the internal church, which is spiritual, and the external church, which is natural, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>. That "the earth" also signifies damnation, n. <a href="../ae/742.htm">742</a>. That "seas" signify the most external things of man's life, which are called sensual, n. <a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>, <a href="../ae/511.htm">511</a>; that they also signify the hells, n. <a href="../ae/537.htm">537</a>, <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 752 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>752 "Vae habitantibus terram et mare." - Quod significet lamentationem super illos qui mere naturales et sensuales fiunt, constat ex significatione "vae", quod sit lamentatio (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_752/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_531" target=_top>531</a> <sup>1</sup></p><p>); ex significatione "habitantium terram et mare", quod sit mere naturales et sensuales; nam cum per "habitantes in caelis" significantur spirituales, per "inhabitantes terram et mare" significantur naturales et sensuales, est enim mens naturalis et sensualis infra mentem spiritualem, sicut est terra et mare infra caelos; et quoque in mundo spirituali apparent caeli in editis, et longe infra illos terrae et maria, ac in caelis habitant spirituales, et super terris longe infra illos habitant naturales, ac in maribus sensuales; quisque enim habitat alte et profunde, sicut interiora ejus, quae vocantur mentis, aperta aut clausa sunt. Inde est quod in Verbo per "caelum et terram" quibusdam in locis significetur ecclesia interna et externa, seu ecclesia spiritualis et naturalis; tum in particulari homo spiritualis et naturalis, ex causa quia ecclesia est in homine, et inde homo est ecclesia, qui spiritualis est. Quod hic per "terram et mare" significentur mere naturales et sensuales, est quia per "terram" hic intelligitur illa terra in quam "draco projectus est", et in quam "descendit diabolus", ut mox sequitur: ac mere naturalis seu externus homo ibi est; nam naturalis homo absque spirituali, seu externus homo absque interno, est super terra damnata, sub qua est infernum: homo enim nascitur sensualis et naturalis, ita sicut in inferno, quia in omnis generis mala; at per regenerationem fit spiritualis, et per illam extrahitur homo ab inferno, et elevatur in caelum a Domino; inde est, quod haec lamentatio sit super illos qui mere naturales et sensuales sunt. Quod lamentatio sit super illos, est quia intelliguntur illi qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, ita qui dicunt se in fide esse, tametsi in nulla vita fidei; quod illi mere naturales et sensuales fiant, supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_752/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714" target=_top>714</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_752/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_739" target=_top>739</a>) ostensum est; illi etiam per "draconem et ejus angelos", ac per "serpentem antiquum", intelliguntur; hic autem qui facile a dracone et ejus angelis se patiuntur seduci: hi itaque sunt, de quibus dicitur, "Vae habitantibus terram et mare." (Quod per "caelum et terram" significetur ecclesia interna quae spiritualis, et ecclesia externa quae naturalis, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_752/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_304" target=_top>304</a>.
