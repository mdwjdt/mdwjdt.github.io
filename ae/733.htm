<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 733</h4><p>733. Verses 7, 8. "And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. And they prevailed not, and their place was not found any more in heaven."<p>"And there was war in heaven" signifies combat of falsity against truth, and of truth against falsity; "Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels," signifies combat between those who are for a life of love and of charity and for the Divine of the Lord in His Human, and those who are for faith alone or faith separated from charity, and who are opposed to the Divine of the Lord in His Human. "And they prevailed not, and their place was not found any more in heaven," signifies that they were overcome, and that nowhere hereafter in the heavens will there be a place, corresponding to the state of their life, which is merely a state of thought, and not one of affection for good and truth. </p>
