<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 523</h4><p>523. Verse 12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; and so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. "And the fourth angel sounded," signifies influx out of heaven, and thence a fourth change; "and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars," signifies that all the good of love perished, all the good and truth of faith, and all cognition of good and truth; and "so that the third part of them was darkened," signifies they were all converted into falsities of evil, and into evils of falsity; "and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise," signifies that the light of spiritual truth, and the light of natural truth, were completely extinguished. </p>
