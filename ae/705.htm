<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 705</h4><p>705. CHAPTER 12.<p>1. AND a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.<p>2. And she being with child, cried out, travailing, and in pain to bring forth.<p>3. And there was seen another sign in heaven; and, behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.<p>4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them unto the earth; and the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she had brought forth he might devour her child.<p>5. And she brought forth a male child, who is to tend all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and his throne.<p>6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and sixty days.<p>7. And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels.<p>8. And they prevailed not; and their place was not found any more in heaven.<p>9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil and Satan, which seduceth the whole world; he was cast out unto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<p>10. And I heard a great voice saying in heaven, Now is come the salvation and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before God day and night.<p>11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.<p>12. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down unto you, having great anger, knowing that he hath but a short time.<p>13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast out to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child.<p>14. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, unto her place, where she is nourished a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.<p>15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the woman, water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.<p>16. And the earth helped the woman; and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed up the river, which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<p>17. And the dragon was wroth against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<p>18. And I stood upon the sand of the sea.<p>EXPLANATION.<p>Verses 1, 2. And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. And she being with child, cried out, travailing, and in pain to bring forth.<p>"And a great sign was seen in heaven," signifies Divine testification concerning the future church, and the reception of its doctrine, and as to those by whom it will be assaulted; "a woman encompassed with the sun," signifies the church with those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in love towards the neighbour; "and the moon under her feet," signifies faith with those who are in charity; ["and upon her head a crown of twelve stars," signifies the wisdom and intelligence of those of that church through doctrinals and the knowledges of all things of truth and good from the Word.] <sup>1</sup>"And she being with child," signifies doctrine in its birth from the good of celestial love; "cried out, travailing in birth, and in pain to bring forth," signifies non-reception by those who are in the church, and the resistance of those who are in faith separated from charity.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;These words are omitted from the author's MS. in this place, but occur in n. <a href="../ae/709.htm">709</a>, we have, therefore, placed them here in brackets (Tr). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 705</h4><p>705. APOCALYPSE. CHAPTER 12.<p>1. And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.<p>2. And being with child she cried out, travailing, and pained to bring forth.<p>3. And there was seen another sign in heaven; and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.<p>4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them unto the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she brought forth he might devour her offspring.<p>5. And she brought forth a son, a male who is to tend all the nations with an iron rod; and her offspring was caught up unto God and His throne.<p>6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and sixty days.<p>7. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels.<p>8. And they prevailed not; and their place was not found anymore in heaven.<p>9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, that seduceth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<p>10. And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, that accuseth them before our God day and night.<p>11. And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb, and through the word of their testimony: and they loved not their soul even unto death.<p>12. For this rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down unto you, having great anger, knowing that he hath but a short time.<p>13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the son.<p>14.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 705 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>705. CAPUT XII.<p>1. Et signum magnum visum est in caelo; mulier circumdata sole, et luna sub pedibus ejus, et super capite ejus corona stellarum duodecim.<p>2. Et in utero habens clamavit parturiens, et cruciata parere.<p>3. Et visum est aliud signum in caelo; et ecce draco magnus rufus, habens capita septem, et cornua decem, et super capitibus suis diademata septem.<p>4. Et cauda sua traxit tertiam partem stellarum caeli, et projecit illas in terram; et draco stetit coram muliere futura parere ut postquam pepererit, fetum ejus devoraret.<p>5. Et peperit filium masculum, qui futurus pascere omnes gentes virga ferrea; et raptus est fetus ejus ad Deum et thronum Ipsius.<p>6. Et mulier fugit in desertum, ubi habet locum praeparatum a Deo, ut ibi alant eam diebus mille ducentis sexaginta.<p>7. Et factum est bellum in caelo; Michael et angeli ejus pugnarunt cum dracone, et draco pugnavit et angeli ejus.<p>8. Et non praevaluerunt, et non locus inventus eorum amplius in caelo.<p>9. Et projectus est draco ille magnus, ille serpens antiquus, vocatus diabolus et satanas, seducens universum orbem, projectus est in terram, et angeli ejus cum illo projecti sunt.<p>10. Et audivi vocem magnam dicentem in caelo, Nunc facta est salus et potentia et regnum Dei nostri, et potestas Christi Ipsius, quia projectus est accusator fratrum nostrorum, accusans illos coram Deo nostro dies et noctes.<p>11. Et illi vicerunt eum per sanguinem Agni, et per verbum testimonii illorum, et non dilexerunt animam suam usque ad mortem.<p>12. Propter hoc gaudete, caeli, et in illis habitantes vae habitantibus terram et mare, quia descendit diabolus ad vos, habens iram magnam, sciens quod exiguum tempus habeat.<p>13. Et cum vidit draco quod projectus in terram, persecutus est mulierem quae peperit filium.<p>14. Et datae mulieri duae alae aquilae magnae, ut volaret in desertum in locum suum, ubi aleretur ibi tempus et tempora et dimidium temporis a facie serpentis.<p>15. Et ejecit serpens post mulierem ex ore suo aquam tanquam flumen, ut illam a flumine absorptam faceret.<p>16. Et adjuvit terra mulierem, et aperuit terra os suum, et deglutivit flumen quod ejecit draco ex ore suo.<p>17. Et iratus est draco contra mulierem, et abivit facere bellum cum reliquis seminis ejus, observantibus mandata Dei, et habentibus testimonium Jesu Christi.<p>18. [B.A. 13:[1] . Et steti supra arenam maris.<p>EXPLICATIO.<p>VERSUS 1, 2.<p>"Et signum magnum visum est in caelo; mulier circumdata sole, et luna sub pedibus ejus, et super capite ejus corona stellarum duodecim.
