<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 655</h4><p>655. Where also our Lord was crucified.- That this signifies by means of which He was rejected and condemned, namely, by means of evils, and falsities therefrom springing from infernal love, is evident from this consideration, that evils themselves and their consequent falsities arising from infernal love are what reject and condemn the Lord, and these evils and the falsities therefrom are signified by Sodom and Egypt, therefore it is said concerning the city of Jerusalem that it is called so spiritually, for to be spiritually called signifies evil itself, and the falsity therefrom.</p><p>[2] The hells are separated into two kingdoms opposite the two kingdoms in the heavens; the kingdom opposite the celestial kingdom is at the back, and those who are there are called genii, and this kingdom is what is understood in the Word by "devil." But the kingdom opposite the spiritual kingdom is in front, and those who are there are called evil spirits; this kingdom is what is meant in the Word by "Satan." These hells, or these two kingdoms into which the hells are separated, are meant by Sodom and Egypt. Whether it is said evils and falsities therefrom, or those hells, it is the same thing, since from these all evils and falsities ascend.</p><p>[3] The Jews of Jerusalem crucifying the Lord signifies that the evils and the falsities therefrom which they loved crucified Him; for all things recorded in the Word concerning the Lord's passion represented the perverted state of the church with that nation. For although they accounted the Word holy, yet they perverted all things therein by their traditions until there was no longer any Divine Good and Truth remaining with them, and, when the Divine Good and Truth that are in the Word no longer remain, then evils and falsities from infernal love succeed in their place, and these are what crucify the Lord. That such things are signified by the Lord's passion, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/83.htm">83</a>, <a href="../ae/195.htm">195:21</a>, <a href="../ae/627.htm">627:16</a>, at the end). The Lord is said to be slain because it signifies His being rejected and denied, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/328.htm">328</a>). Concerning the nature and quality of the Jews, see above (n. <a href="../ae/122.htm">122</a>, <a href="../ae/433.htm">433:28</a>, <a href="../ae/619.htm">619</a>), and in the <a href="../njhd/248.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>).</p><p>[4] Since it is here said "where our Lord was crucified," it shall be explained what crucifixion, or suspension upon wood, signified with the Jews. There were two punishments of death with them, crucifixion and stoning; and by crucifixion was signified condemnation and a curse on account of the destruction of good in the church, and by stoning was signified condemnation and a curse on account of the destruction of truth in the church. Crucifixion signified condemnation and a curse on account of the destruction of good in the church, because wood, upon which they were suspended, signified good, and, in the opposite sense, evil, both pertaining to the will. Stoning signified condemnation and a curse on account of the destruction of truth in the church, because stone, with which stoning was effected, signified truth, and, in the opposite sense falsity, both pertaining to the understanding. For all things instituted with the Israelitish and Jewish nation were representative, and thence significative. That wood signifies good, and, in the opposite sense, evil, and that stone signifies truth, and, in the opposite sense, falsity, may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8354.htm">8354</a>). But because it has been hitherto unknown whence the punishment of the cross and of stoning came to the Jews and Israelites, and since it is nevertheless important that this should be known, I will also adduce confirmations from the Word to show that these two punishments also were representative.</p><p>[5] That suspension upon wood, or crucifixion, was inflicted on account of the destruction of good in the church, and that thus was represented evil from infernal love, from which comes condemnation and a curse is evident from the following passages.<p>In Moses:<p>"If there be a stubborn and rebellious son, obeying not the voice of his father and mother, all the men of the city shall stone him with stones that he die. And if there be in a man sin and judgment of death, and he be slain, thou shalt hang him upon wood; his carcase shall not remain all night upon wood, but burying thou shalt bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is the curse of God, and thou shalt not defile thy land." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_21_18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_21_20.htm">20-23</a>.)<p>Not obeying the voice of father and mother, signifies in the spiritual sense, to live contrary to the precepts and truths of the church; the punishment for it was therefore stoning. The men of the city who shall stone him signify those who are in the doctrine of the church, a city denoting doctrine. If there be in a man sin and judgment of death, thou shalt hang him upon wood, means if one has done evil against the good of the Word and of the church. Because this was a capital crime, he was to be hung upon wood, for wood, in the Word, signifies good, and in the opposite sense evil. His carcase shall not remain all night upon the wood, but thou shalt bury him the same day, signifies lest there be a representative of eternal damnation. Thou shalt not defile thy land, signifies that it would be a scandal to the church.</p><p>[6] In Lamentations:<p>"Our skins are become black as an oven, because of the storms of famine; they ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah; their princes were hanged up by the hand, the faces of the elders are not honoured, the young men they have led away to grind, and the boys stumble under wood" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_10.htm">5:10-13</a>).<p>Zion means the celestial church, which is in the good of love to the Lord; was represented by the Jewish nation. The virgins in the cities of Judah signify the affections for truth from the good of love; the perishing of truths from good by falsities from evil is signified by, their princes were hanged up by the hand. The faces of the elders which are not honoured signify the goods of wisdom; the young men who are led away to grind signify truths from good: and grinding signifies to acquire falsities and to confirm them from the Word; the boys who stumble under wood signify goods just springing up and perishing through evils.</p><p>[7] Since a baker, just as bread, signifies the good of love, and a butler, just as wine, signifies the truth of doctrine, therefore the baker was hanged on account of his crime against king Pharaoh. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_40_19.htm">Genesis 40:19-22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_41_13.htm">41:13</a>.) This may be seen explained in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1-4</a>). To commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab signifies to adulterate the goods of the church; and to be hung up before the sun signifies condemnation and a curse on account of the destruction of the good of the church.</p><p>[8] Because Ai signified knowledges of good and in the opposite sense, confirmations, of evil, therefore the king of Ai was hanged on wood, and afterwards thrown down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and the city itself was burned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_8_26.htm">Joshua 8:26-29</a>). And because the five kings of the Amorites signified evils and falsities therefrom, destroying the goods and truths of the church, therefore those kings were hanged by Joshua, and afterwards cast into the cave of Makkedah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_27.htm">27</a>). The cave of Makkedah signifies direful falsity from evil.</p><p>[9] To be hung upon wood, or crucified, signifies the punishment of evil destroying the good of the church, in Matthew Jesus said,<p>"I send unto you prophets, wise men, and scribes; some of them ye will kill, crucify, and scourge in the synagogues, and persecute them from city to city" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_34.htm">23:34</a>).<p>All things which the Lord spoke He spoke from the Divine, but the Divine things from which He spoke fell into the ideas of natural thought and the resulting expressions according to correspondences, like those here and elsewhere in the Evangelists; and as all the words have a spiritual sense, therefore in that sense, prophets, wise men, and scribes, are not meant, but instead of them the truth and good of doctrine and of the Word. For spiritual thought and speech therefrom, like that of the angels, is without the idea of person, therefore by a prophet is signified the truth of doctrine, by wise men the good of doctrine, and by scribes the Word from which is doctrine. It therefore follows, that to kill has reference to the truth of the doctrine of the church, which is meant by a prophet, to crucify has reference, to the good of doctrine, which is meant by a wise man, and to scourge has reference to the Word, which is meant by a scribe and that thus "to kill" signifies to extinguish, "to crucify" to destroy, and "to scourge" to pervert. That they will wander from one falsity of doctrine to another is signified by persecuting them from city to city, a city denoting doctrine. This is the spiritual sense of the above words.</p><p>[10] In the same,<p>Jesus said unto the disciples that He must suffer at Jerusalem, and that the Son of Man must be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and that "they shall condemn him, and deliver him up to the nations to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified, and that on the third day he shall rise again" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_18.htm">Matthew 20:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_19.htm">19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_32.htm">Mark 10:32-34</a>).<p>The spiritual sense of these words is, that Divine Truth, in the church where mere falsities of doctrine and evils of life reign, shall be blasphemed, its truth perverted, and its good destroyed. The Son of Man signifies Divine Truth, which is the Word, and Jerusalem signifies the church where mere falsities and evils reign. The chief priests and scribes signify the adulterations of good and falsifications of truth, both of them from infernal love. By condemning and delivering Him to the nations is signified to relegate Divine Truth and Divine Good to hell, and to deliver them to the evils and falsities which are therefrom, the nations signifying the evils which are from hell and which destroy the goods of the church. To be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified, signifies to blaspheme, falsify, and pervert the truth, and to adulterate and destroy the good of the church and of the Word (as above). And the third day He shall rise again, signifies the complete glorification of the Lord's Human.</p><p>[11] From these things it is evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by the crucifixion of the Lord, also what is signified by the various mockings on that occasion, as that they set a crown of thorns upon His head; that they smote Him with a reed, and that they spat in His face, besides other things related in the Evangelists, signifying that the Jewish nation thus impiously treated the Divine Truth and Good itself, which the Lord was. For the Lord suffered the impious state of that church to be represented in Himself; this also was signified by His bearing their iniquities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>). For it was a common thing for a prophet to take upon himself the representation of the impious states of the church. Thus the prophet Isaiah was commanded to go naked and barefoot three years, in order to represent the church as destitute of good and truth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_4.htm">4</a>). The prophet Ezekiel bound in cords laid siege against a tile, on which Jerusalem was portrayed, and ate a cake of barley made with the dung of an ox, to represent that the truth and good of the church were thus besieged by falsities and polluted by evils (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-13</a>). The prophet Hosea was commanded to take to himself a harlot for a woman, and children of whoredoms, in order to represent what was then the quality of the church (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_1_1.htm">Hosea 1:1-11</a>); besides other things of a similar nature. That this was bearing the iniquities of the house of Israel or the church is openly declared in Ezekiel (chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_5.htm">4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_6.htm">6</a>). From these things it is evident that everything recorded concerning the Lord's passion was representative of the state of the church with the Jewish nation at that time.</p><p>[12] Thus much concerning the punishment of suspension upon wood, or crucifixion. It does not belong to this place to confirm from the Word that the other punishment of death, which was stoning, signified condemnation and a curse on account of the destruction of the truth of the church, still it is evident from the passages in the Word where stoning is mentioned, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_28.htm">Exodus 21:28-33</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_10.htm">Leviticus 24:10-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_32.htm">Numbers 15:32-37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">17:5-7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_20.htm">22:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_39.htm">Ezekiel 16:39-41</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_45.htm">23:45-47</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_6.htm">20:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_7.htm">John 8:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_31.htm">10:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_32.htm">32</a>; and elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 655</h4><p>655. Where also our Lord was crucified, signifies by which, namely, by the evils and the falsities therefrom springing from infernal love, He was rejected and condemned. This is evident from this, that evils themselves and their falsities springing from infernal love are what reject and condemn the Lord. These evils and the falsities thence are signified by "Sodom and Egypt," therefore it is said of the city Jerusalem that it is thus "called spiritually," for "to be called spiritually Sodom and Egypt" signifies evil itself, and the falsity therefrom.</p><p>[2] The hells are divided into two kingdoms, over against the two kingdoms in the heavens; the kingdom over against the celestial kingdom is at the back, and those who are in it are called genii; this kingdom is what is meant in the Word by "devil;" but the kingdom that is over against the spiritual kingdom is in front, and those who are in it are called evil spirits; this kingdom is what is meant in the Word by "Satan." These hells, or these two kingdoms into which the hells are divided, are meant by "Sodom and Egypt." Whether it is said evils and the falsities therefrom, or these hells, it is the same, since from these all evils and all falsities therefrom ascend.</p><p>[3] That the Jews who were at Jerusalem crucified the Lord means that He was crucified by the evils and falsities therefrom which they loved; for all things recorded in the Word respecting the Lord's passion represented the perverted state of the church with that nation. For although they accounted the Word holy, yet by their traditions they perverted all things therein until there was no longer any Divine good or truth remaining with them, and when Divine good and Divine truth, which are in the Word, no longer remain, evils and falsities from infernal love succeed in their place, and these are what crucify the Lord. (That such things are signified by the Lord's passion may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/83.htm">83</a>, <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/627.htm">627</a>. That the Lord is said "to be slain" signifies that he was rejected and denied, see above, n. <a href="../ae/328.htm">328</a>; and that the Jews were such, see above, n. <a href="../ae/122.htm">122</a>, <a href="../ae/433.htm">433</a>, <a href="../ae/619.htm">619</a>; and in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. <a href="../njhd/248.htm">248</a>.)</p><p>[4] As it is here said "where our Lord was crucified," it shall be told what "crucifixion" (or hanging upon wood) signified with the Jews. They had two modes of capital punishment, crucifixion and stoning; and "crucifixion" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of good in the church, and "stoning" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of truth in the church. "Crucifixion" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of good in the church, for the reason that "wood," upon which they were hung, signified good, and in the contrary sense evil, both pertaining to the will; and "stoning" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of truth in the church, for the reason that "the stone," with which they were stoned, signified truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, both pertaining to the understanding; for all things instituted with the Israelitish and Jewish nation were representative, and thence significative. (That "wood" signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, and that a "stone" signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643[1-4]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8354.htm">8354</a>.) But as it has not been known heretofore why the Jews and Israelites had the punishment of the cross and the punishment of stoning, and it is important that it should be known, I will cite some confirmations from the Word to show that these two punishments were representative.</p><p>[5] That "hanging upon wood" or "crucifixion" was inflicted because of the destruction of good in the church, and that it thus represented the evil of infernal love, whence arises a condemnation and curse, can be seen from the following passages. In Moses:<p>If there be a stubborn and rebellious son, obeying not the voice of his father or mother, all the men of the city shall stone him with stones that he may die. And if there be in a man a crime and judgment of death, and he be put to death, thou shalt hang him upon wood; his carcass shall not remain overnight upon the wood, but burying thou shalt bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a curse of God, and thou shalt not defile thy land (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_21_18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_21_20.htm">20-23</a>).<p>"Not obeying the voice of father or mother" signifies in the spiritual sense to live contrary to the precepts and truths of the church, therefore the penalty for it was stoning; "the men of the city who were to stone him" signify those who are in the doctrine of the church, "city" signifying doctrine. "If there be in a man a crime, a judgment of death, thou shalt hang him upon wood" signifies if one has done evil against the good of the Word and of the church; because this was a capital crime he was to be hung upon wood, for in the Word "wood" signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil; "his carcass shall not remain overnight upon the wood, but thou shalt bury him the same day," signifies lest there be a representative of eternal damnation; "thou shalt not defile thy land" signifies that this would be a cause of offense to the church.</p><p>[6] In Lamentations:<p>Our skins are become black like an oven because of the tempests of famine; they ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah; their princes were hanged up by the hand, the faces of the elders are not honored, the young men they have led away to grind, and the boys stumble under the wood (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_10.htm">Lamentations 5:10-13</a>).<p>"Zion" means the celestial church, which is in the good of love to the Lord, which church the Jewish nation represented; "the virgins in the cities of Judah" signify the affections of truth from the good of love; "their princes were hanged up by the hand" signifies that truths from good were destroyed by falsities from evil; "the faces of the elders that were not honored" signify the goods of wisdom; "the young men who were led away to grind" signify the truths from good, "to grind" signifying to acquire falsities and to confirm them from the Word; "the boys stumble under the wood" signifies newborn goods perishing through evils.</p><p>[7] A "baker" as also "bread" signifies the good of love, and a "butler" as also "wine," the truth of doctrine, therefore:<p>The baker was hanged on account of his crime against king Pharaoh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_40_19.htm">Genesis 40:19-22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_41_13.htm">41:13</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1-4</a>).<p>"To commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab" signifies to adulterate the goods of the church; and "to be hung up before the sun" signifies a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of the good of the church.</p><p>[8] Because "Ai" signifies the knowledges of good, and in the contrary sense the confirmations of evil:<p>The king of Ai was hanged on wood, and afterwards thrown down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and the city itself was burned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_8_26.htm">Joshua 8:26-29</a>).<p>And because "the five kings of the Amorites" signified evils and falsities therefrom destroying the goods and truths of the church,<p>Those kings were hanged by Joshua, and afterwards cast into the cave of Makkedah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_27.htm">27</a>);<p>"the cave of Makkedah" signifying direful falsity from evil.</p><p>[9] Again, "to be hung upon wood or to be crucified" signifies the punishment of evil that destroys the good of the church, in Matthew:<p>Jesus said, I send unto you prophets, wise men, and scribes; and some of them shall ye kill, crucify, and scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a>).<p>All things the Lord spoke He spoke from the Divine, but the Divine things from which he spoke fell into the ideas of natural thought and consequent expressions according to correspondences, like these here and elsewhere in the Gospels; and as all the words have a spiritual sense, so in that sense prophets, wise men, and scribes, are not here meant, but instead of them the truth and good of doctrine and of the Word; for spiritual thought and speech therefrom, like that of angels, is without the idea of person; so a "prophet" signifies the truth of doctrine, "wise men" the good of doctrine, and "scribes" the Word from which is doctrine; from this it follows that "to kill" has reference to the truth of the doctrine of the church, which is meant by a "prophet;" "to crucify" has reference to the good of doctrine, which is meant by "a wise man," and "to scourge" has reference to the Word, which is meant by a "scribe;" thus "to kill" signifies to extinguish, "to crucify" to destroy, and "to scourge" to pervert. That they will wander from one falsity of doctrine into another is signified by "persecuting them from city to city," "city" signifying doctrine. This is the spiritual sense of these words.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Jesus said to the disciples that He must suffer at Jerusalem, and that the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him, and deliver Him up to the Gentiles to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified; and the third day He shall rise again (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_18.htm">Matthew 20:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_19.htm">19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_32.htm">Mark 10:32-34</a>).<p>The spiritual sense of these words is that Divine truth, in the church where mere falsities of doctrine and evils of life reign, shall be blasphemed, its truth shall be perverted, and its good destroyed. "The Son of man" signifies Divine truth, which is the Word, and "Jerusalem" signifies the church where mere falsities and evils reign; "the chief priests and scribes" signify the adulterations of good and the falsifications of truth, both from infernal love; "to condemn Him and deliver Him to the Gentiles" signifies to assign Divine truth and Divine good to hell and to deliver them to the evils and falsities that are from hell, the "Gentiles" signifying the evils that are from hell and that destroy the goods of the church; "to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified," signifies to blaspheme, falsify and pervert the truth, and to adulterate and destroy the good of the church and of the Word (as above); "and the third day He shall rise again" signifies the complete glorification of the Lord's Human.</p><p>[11] From this it can be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by the Lord's crucifixion, also what is signified by the various mockings then connected with it, as that "they put a crown of thorns on His head," that "they smote Him with a reed," and also that "they spat in His face," with many other things related in the Gospels, this signifying that the Jewish nation treated Divine truth and good itself, which was the Lord, in a like heinous manner; for the Lord suffered the heinous state of that church to be represented in Himself; and this was also signified by:<p>His bearing their iniquities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>).<p>For it was a common thing for a prophet to take upon himself a representation of the heinous things of the church; thus the prophet Isaiah was commanded to go naked and barefoot three years, to represent the church as destitute of good and truth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_4.htm">4</a>); the prophet Ezekiel, bound in cords, laid siege to a tile on which Jerusalem was depicted, and ate a cake of barley made with the dung of an ox, to represent that the truth and good of the church was thus besieged by falsities and polluted by evils (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-13</a>); the prophet Hosea was commanded to take a harlot to himself for a woman, and children of whoredoms, to represent what the quality of the church was at that time (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_1_1.htm">Hosea 1:1-11</a>); with other like things. That this was "bearing the iniquities of the house of Israel" or the church is plainly declared in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_6.htm">6</a>. From this it can be seen that all things recorded concerning the passion of the Lord were representative of the state of the church at that time with the Jewish nation.</p><p>[12] Thus much respecting the punishment of "hanging upon wood or crucifixion." This is not the place to confirm from the Word that the other punishment, which was "stoning," signified a condemnation and curse because of the destroyed truth of the church, but it can be seen from the passages where "stoning" is mentioned (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_28.htm">Exodus 21:28-33</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_10.htm">Leviticus 24:10-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_32.htm">Numbers 15:32-37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">17:5-7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_20.htm">22:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_39.htm">Ezekiel 16:39-41</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_45.htm">23:45-47</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_6.htm">20:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_7.htm">John 8:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_31.htm">10:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_32.htm">32</a>; and elsewhere). </p>
