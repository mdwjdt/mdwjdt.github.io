<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 95</h4><p>95. (Verse 1) Unto the angel of the Ephesian church write. That this signifies for remembrance to those within the church who are in the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth and good from the Word, is evident from the signification of writing, as being for remembrance (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8620.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8620</a>). The reason why it is for those within the church who are in the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth and good from the Word, is that these are they who are meant by the angel of the Ephesian Church. That these are meant is evident from those things that are written to the angel of that Church. What is meant by the angel of each church, can be known only from the internal sense of the subsequent things that are written. It is said from the internal sense, because all things in the Apocalypse are prophetic, and things prophetic cannot be explained except by means of the internal sense. Who is there, when he reads the prophets, that does not see that there are arcana therein, more deeply hidden than in the plain sense of the letter? And because those arcana cannot be seen by the natural man alone, therefore, those who regard the Word as holy, pass by those things they do not understand, acknowledging that there is an arcanum therein which they do not understand, and which some call mystical. That this is the spiritual of the Word, is known to some, because they think that the Word in its bosom is spiritual, since it is Divine. Still, however, it has been hitherto unknown that this is its spiritual sense, and that the Word is understood in this sense by the angels, and that by this sense there is conjunction of heaven with the man of the church (as may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/303.htm">Heaven and Hell 303-310</a>). The reason why those who are in the knowledges (cognitiones) of good and truth from the Word, are meant by the angel of the Ephesian church is, because by the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth and good are meant the doctrinals, of the church, and these can be obtained from no other source than from the Word. The reason why it is said, Write to the angel of the church, and not to the church, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/92.htm">92</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 95</h4><p>95. Verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8620.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8620</a>). It means to those within the church who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, because these are meant by the "angel of the Ephesian church." That these are meant is evident from the things written to the angel of that church. What is meant by the angel of each church can be known only from the internal sense of the things written to each church. It is said, "from the internal sense," since all things in Revelation are prophetic, and things prophetic can be explained only by the internal sense. Who that reads the Prophets does not see that there are arcana therein that are more deeply hidden than the plain meaning of the letter? And since these arcana cannot be seen by the merely natural man, those who account the Word holy pass those things by that they do not understand, saying that there is a hidden meaning therein that is unknown to them, and that some call mystical. That this is the spiritual of the Word is known by some, because they think of the Word as being in its bosom spiritual for the reason that it is Divine. Nevertheless, it has been unknown heretofore that this is the spiritual sense of the Word, and that the Word is understood in this sense by angels, and that by means of this sense there is conjunction of heaven with the man of the church (See in the work on <a href="../hh/303.htm">Heaven and Hell 303-310</a>). Those who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word are meant by the "angel of the Ephesian church," because by the knowledges of truth and good are meant the doctrinals of the church, and only from the Word can doctrinals be obtained. Why it is said, "To the angel of the church, write," and not, To the church, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/92.htm">92</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 95 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>95. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_95/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_1" target=_top>1</a>.) "Angelo Ephesinae Ecclesiae scribe." - Quod significet ad recordationem illis qui intra ecclesiam in cognitionibus veri et boni ex Verbo sunt, constat ex significatione "scribere", quod sit ad recordationem (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_95/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8620" target=_top>8620</a>); quod sit illis qui intra ecclesiam qui in cognitionibus veri et boni ex Verbo sunt, est quia illi sunt qui per "Angelum Ephesinae Ecclesiae" intelliguntur; quod illi intelligantur, constat ex illis quae ad istius ecclesiae angelum scripta sunt; non aliunde sciri potest quid per cujusvis ecclesiae angelum intelligitur, quam ex sensu interno eorum quae sequuntur scripta: dicitur ex sensu interno, quia omnia quae in Apocalypsi sunt prophetica, et prophetica non explicabilia sunt quam per sensum internum. Quis non videt, qui legit Prophetas, quod arcana ibi sint, quae altius recondita sunt quam in sensu plano litterae? Et quia arcana illa a solo naturali homine non possunt videri, quapropter illi qui sanctum habent Verbum praetereunt illa quae non intelligunt, dicentes quod insit arcanum quod non sciunt, et quod quidam vocant mysticum; quod hoc sit spirituale Verbi, aliqui sciunt, quia cogitant quod Verbum in suo sinu spirituale insit quia Divinum; sed usque hactenus ignotum fuit quod id sit sensus ejus spiritualis, et quod Verbum in hoc Sensu intelligatur ab angelis, ac quod per eum sensum sit conjunctio caeli cum homine ecclesiae (videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_95/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_303" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 303-310</a>). Quod illi qui in cognitionibus veri et boni ex Verbo sunt, intelligantur per "Angelum Ephesinae Ecclesiae", est quia per cognitiones veri et boni intelliguntur doctrinalia ecclesiae, et haec non aliunde possunt haberi quam ex Verbo. Cur dicitur, "Ad Angelum Ecclesiae scribe", et non Ad Ecclesiam, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_95/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_92" target=_top>92</a>). </p>
