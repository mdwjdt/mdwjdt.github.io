<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 53</h4><p>53. (Verse 10) I was in the spirit. That this signifies, a spiritual state in which there is revelation, is evident from the signification of being in the spirit, as being to be brought into the state in which spirits and angels are, which is a spiritual state. Man is brought into this state when he comes into the state of his spirit; for every man is a spirit as to his interiors (as may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/432.htm">Heaven and Hell 432-444</a>). When a man is in this state, the things which exist in the spiritual world are seen by him as clearly as objects in the natural world; but because the objects then seen by him are from a spiritual origin, they are in themselves spiritual, and such things as pertain to heavenly wisdom are set before him in a natural image as it were. In this way Divine things are presented in visible forms before the eyes of spirits and angels; hence it is that all the things seen in heaven, are representative and significative, as also the things seen by John, which are treated of in the Apocalypse. (Moreover the nature of such things may be known from what is said and shown concerning representatives and appearances in heaven, in the work, <a href="../hh/170.htm">Heaven and Hell 170-176</a>.)</p><p>[2] While a man is in the body he does not see the things that are in heaven, unless the sight of his spirit is opened; but when this is opened, then he sees them. In this way John saw the things described in the Apocalypse. The prophets saw them also in the same way; they are therefore called "Seers," and are said to have had their "eyes opened"; angels also were seen in ancient times in the same way, and so also the Lord was seen by the disciples after His resurrection. This sight is that of the spiritual man; and because in such circumstances all things appear representatively, therefore this sight was opened in John.<p>He who knows nothing of this sight believes that, when angels were seen by men, they assumed a human form, and that when they vanished out of sight, they laid it down; this, however, was not the case, but angels then appeared in their own form, which is the human form, not before the sight of their bodily eyes, but before the sight of their spirit, this sight being then opened. This is plainly evident from the Lord being seen by the disciples after His resurrection, when He Himself showed them that He was a man in a perfect form (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_20.htm">John 20:20-28</a>); and nevertheless He became invisible; for when they saw Him, the eyes of their spirit were opened; but when He became invisible those eyes were closed. That man has a sight of this kind, is evident to me from much experience; for all the things that I have seen in the heavens were seen by means of that sight; and then I was in a state of wakefulness similar to that in which I was when they were not seen. But this sight is seldom opened to any one by the Lord at this day, and that for many reasons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 53</h4><p>53. Verse 10. I was in the spirit, signifies a spiritual state when there is revelation. This is evident from the signification of "to be in the spirit," as being to be brought into the state in which spirits and angels are, which state is a spiritual state. Into this state a man is brought when he is let into the state of his spirit, for every man is a spirit as regards his interiors (See in the work on <a href="../hh/432.htm">Heaven and Hell 432-444</a>). When a man is in that state, the things that are in the spiritual world appear to him as clearly as objects appear in the natural world; but the things that appear, because they are of spiritual origin, are in themselves spiritual, and such things as are of heavenly wisdom are presented as it were in a natural image. In this way Divine things are presented before the eyes of spirits and angels in visible forms. From this it is that all things that are seen in heaven are representative and significative, as were also the things seen by John, as described in Revelation. (The character of such things can be further learned from what is said and shown concerning Representatives and Appearances in Heaven, in the work on He aven and Hell, n. <a href="../hh/170.htm">170-176</a>.)</p><p>[2] While man is in the body he does not see such things as are in heaven, unless the sight of his spirit is opened; when this is opened, then he sees. In this way John saw the things described in Revelation; and in like manner the prophets saw; and they were therefore called Seers, and were said to have their eyes opened. In this way also angels were seen in ancient times, and the Lord also was thus seen by the disciples after His resurrection. This sight is the sight of the spiritual man; and because in this state all things appear representatively, John was in it. He who knows nothing about this sight, believes that angels, when seen by men, have taken on a human form, and that when they vanished from their sight they laid it aside; but this is not so; angels then appeared in their own form, which is the human form, not before the sight of men's bodily eyes, but before the sight of their spirit, which sight was then opened. This is evident from the Lord's being seen by the disciples [after His resurrection], when He Himself showed to them that He was a man in a complete human form (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_20.htm">John 20:20-28</a>); and yet He became invisible. When they saw Him the eyes of their spirit were opened, but when He became invisible those eyes were closed. That man has such a sight is clear to me from much experience, for all things I have seen in the heavens have been seen by that sight. At such times I was in the same state of wakefulness as when they were not seen. But at the present time that sight is seldom opened to anyone by the Lord, and for many reasons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 53 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>53. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_10" target=_top>10</a>.) "Factus sum in spiritu." - Quod significet statum spiritualem cum revelatio, constat ex significatione "fieri in spiritu", quod sit reduci in statum in quo sunt spiritus et angeli, qui status est status spiritualis. In hunc statum mittitur homo cum in statum spiritus sui, unusquisque enim homo est spiritus quoad interiora sua (videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_53/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_432" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 432-444</a>). Cum homo in eo statu est, tunc apparent ei illa quae in mundo spirituali sunt, tam clare sicut apparent objecta in mundo naturali; sed illa quae apparent, quia ex origine spirituali, in se spiritualia sunt, et sistuntur in imagine sicut naturali talia quae sapientiae caelestis sunt, ita Divina in formis visibilibus coram oculis spirituum et angelorum. Inde est quod omnia quae in caelo videntur, sint repraesentativa et significativa; et quoque quae Johanni visa sunt, de quibus in Apocalypsi. (Porro qualia sunt, sciri potest ex illis quae De Repraesentativis et Apparantiis in Caelo, in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_53/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_170" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 170-176</a>, dicta et ostensa sunt.)<p>[2] Homo, cum in corpore est, non videt talia quae in caelo sunt nisi aperiatur visus ejus spiritus; et cum hic aperitur, tunc videt. Ita vidit Johannes haec quae in Apocalypsi descripta sunt; et quoque similiter viderunt prophetae, qui ideo vocati sunt "videntes" et "aperti oculis"; etiam ita visi sunt angeli antiquis temporibus, et quoque ita sus est Dominus discipulis post resurrectionem. Hic visus est visus spiritualis hominis; et quia tunc apparent repraesentative omnia, ideo Johannes in hoc fuit. Homo qui non scit aliquid de hoc visu, credit quod angeli, cum visi fuerunt hominibus, assumpserint humanam formam; et cum e conspectu eorum evanuerunt, quod eam deposuerint: sed non ita est; verum angeli tunc apparuerunt in sua forma, quae est humana, non coram visu oculorum corporis sed coram visu spiritus eorum, qui visus tunc aperiebatur. Hoc clare constare potest<p>Ex viso Domino a discipulis, qui quod Homo esset in omni forma, Ipse ostendit illis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_39" target=_top>Luca 24:39</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_20_20-28" target=_top>Johannes 20:20-28</a>);<p>et usque invisibilis factus est: cum enim viderunt Ipsum, aperti sunt oculi spiritus eorum; at cum invisibilis factus est, tunc clausi sunt illi oculi. Quod talis visus homini sit, constat mihi ex multa experientia; omnia enim quae in caelis vidi, per eum visum visa sunt; et tunc in simili statu vigili fui in quo fui cum non visa: sed ille visus raro alicui aperitur hodie a Domino, ex pluribus causis. </p>
