<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 327</h4><p>327. Saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. That this signifies that the Lord from His Divine Human has Omnipotence and Omniscience, is evident from all that has preceded: for the subject hitherto treated of is that the Lord from His Divine Human has Omnipotence and Omniscience, and that thence judgment belongs to Him. That this is meant by, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof," is evident from the series of the things explained from the beginning of this chapter to the present verse, which I desire to cite in order, namely, that by, "I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne," is signified the Lord as to Omnipotence and Omniscience, n. <a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>; by "a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals," is signified the state of the life of all in heaven and in the earth altogether hidden, n. <a href="../ae/299.htm">299</a>, <a href="../ae/300.htm">300</a>; by, "I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?" is signified exploration, whether there is any such as know and perceive the state of the life of all, (n. <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../ae/303.htm">303</a>; by "no one in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book," is signified that no one [could] in the least from himself, n. 304; by, "Behold! the lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof," is signified that the Lord from His own power subdued the hells, and reduced all things in the heavens to order, and this by Divine good united to Divine truth in His Human, (n. <a href="../ae/309.htm">309</a>, <a href="../ae/310.htm">310</a>; by, "I saw a lamb having seven horns, and seven eyes," is signified the Lord as to the Divine Human, [and] that from it He has Omnipotence and Omniscience, n. <a href="../ae/314.htm">314</a>, <a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>, <a href="../ae/317.htm">317</a>; and by, "He came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne," is signified that those things are from His Divine Human, n. <a href="../ae/319.htm">319</a>. Hence it is now clear, that here by, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to loose the seals thereof," is signified that the Lord from the Divine Human has Omnipotence and Omniscience. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 327</h4><p>327. Saying, Worthy art Thou to open <sup>1</sup>the book and to loose the seals thereof, signifies that the Lord from the Divine Human has omnipotence and omniscience. This is evident from all that precedes; for the subject treated of up to this point is that the Lord from the Divine Human has omnipotence and omniscience, and that judgment, therefore, belongs to Him. That this is meant by "worthy art Thou to open the book and to loose the seals thereof" is clear from the series of the things explained from the beginning of this chapter to the present verse, which I will here present in their order, as follows: "I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne," signifies the Lord in respect to omnipotence and omniscience n. <a href="../ae/297.htm">297</a>; "a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals," signifies the states of the life of all in heaven and on earth altogether hidden (n. <a href="../ae/299.htm">299</a>, <a href="../ae/300.htm">300</a>); "I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?" signifies exploration whether there is anyone such that he may know and perceive the state of the life of all (n. <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../ae/303.htm">303</a>); "no one was able, in heaven nor upon the earth nor under the earth, to open the book," signifies that no one from himself can do this at all n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>; "behold the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof," signifies the Lord [as able to do this] because from His own power He subjugated the hells and reduced all things in the heavens to order, and this by Divine good united to Divine truth in His Human (n. <a href="../ae/309.htm">309</a>, <a href="../ae/310.htm">310</a>); "I saw a Lamb standing, having seven horns and seven eyes," signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, that from it He has omnipotence and omniscience (n. <a href="../ae/314.htm">314</a>, <a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>, <a href="../ae/317.htm">317</a>); "and He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne," signifies that these things are from His Divine Human (n. <a href="../ae/319.htm">319</a>). From this it is now clear that here "worthy art Thou to take the book and to loose the seals thereof," signifies that the Lord from the Divine Human has omnipotence and omniscience.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "take." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 327 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>327. "Dicentes, Dignus es accipere librum et aperire sigilla ejus." - Quod significet quod Domino ex Divino Humano sit omnipotentia et omniscientia, constat ex omnibus illis quae praecedunt; actum enim huc usque est de eo, quod Domino ex Divino Humano sit omnipotentia etomniscientia, et inde quod Ipsi sit judicium. Quod id intelligatur per "Dignus es accipere librum et aperire sigilla ejus", patet ex serie rerum explicatarum a principio hujus capitis huc usque, quae velim ordine proferre; nempe, Quod per "Vidi in dextra Sedentis super throno" significetur Dominus quoad omnipotentiam et omniscientiam (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297" target=_top>297</a>): quod per "librum scriptum intus et a tergo, obsignatum sigillis septem", significetur status vitae omnium in caelo et in terra prorsus reconditus (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_299" target=_top>299</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_300" target=_top>300</a>): quod per "Vidi angelum fortem praedicantem voce magna, Quis est dignus aperire librum et solvere sigilla ejus?" significetur exploratio num ullus talis sit ut sciat et percipiat status vitae omnium (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_302" target=_top>302</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_303" target=_top>303</a>): quod per "Nemo potuit in caelo, nec super terra, nec sub terra, aperire librum", significetur quod ne hilum aliquis ex se (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_304" target=_top>304</a>(a)): quod per "Ecce vicit Leo qui est ex tribu Jehudae, Radix Davidis, aperire librum et solvere sigilla ejus", significetur Dominus quod ex propria potentia subjugaverit inferna, ac redegerit omnia in caelis in ordinem, et hoc per Divinum Bonum unitum Divino Vero in suo Humano (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_309" target=_top>309</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_310" target=_top>310</a>); per quod "Vidi Agnum stantem, habentem cornua septem et oculos septem", significetur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, quod Ipsi ex Eo Sit omnipotentia et omniscientia (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_314" target=_top>314</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_316" target=_top>316</a> (a, b), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_317" target=_top>317</a>): et per quod "Venit et accepit librum e dextra Sedentis super throno", significetur quod ex Divino Humano Ipsius sint illa (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_319" target=_top>319</a>). Inde nunc patet quod hic per "Dignus es accipere librum et aperire sigilla ejus", significetur quod Domino ex Divino Humano sit omnipotentia et omniscientia. </p>
