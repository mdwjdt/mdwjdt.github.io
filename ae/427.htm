<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 427</h4><p>427. Till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. That this signifies that those who are in truths from good must first be separated, is evident from the Signification of sealing, which denotes to distinguish and separate, and of which we shall speak presently; from the signification of the servants of God, as denoting those who are in truths from good (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/6.htm">6</a>); and from the signification of forehead, which denotes the good of love. The basis of this signification of the forehead is correspondency; for everything in man's body, both internal and external, corresponds to heaven, the whole heaven in the Lord's sight being as one man and so arranged as to correspond to each and all things in man. The whole face, where the organs of the sensations of sight, smell, hearing, and taste, are situated, corresponds to the affections and thence to the thoughts in general, the eyes corresponding to the understanding, the nostrils to perception, the ears to hearing and obedience, and the taste to the desire of knowing and of becoming wise. But the forehead corresponds to the good of love, from which all these proceed, because it forms the highest part of the face, and embraces at once the anterior and primary parts of the brain, whence are man's intellectual [powers]. Hence the Lord looks upon the angels in the forehead, and the angels look to the Lord with the eyes; the reason of this is that the forehead corresponds to love, from which the Lord looks upon them, while the eyes correspond to the understanding, from which they look to the Lord. For the Lord permits Himself to be seen by means of the influx of love into their understandings. Concerning this fact see <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141</a>, <a href="../hh/151.htm">151</a>), and that the whole heaven collectively represents one man (n. 68 to 87); and that therefore there is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man (n. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>). From these things it is evident that being sealed on their foreheads, signifies to be in the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and by means of that to be distinguished and separated from those who are not in that love. For the Lord looks upon them in the forehead, and fills them with the good of love, from which they look to Him with thought from affection. Others cannot be looked upon by the Lord in the forehead, because they avert themselves from Him, and turn to that opposite love, which fills and attracts them. That every one in the spiritual world, and also man as to his spirit, turns the face to the ruling love may be seen in <a href="../hh/17.htm">Heaven and Hell 17</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>, <a href="../hh/142.htm">142-144</a>, <a href="../hh/153.htm">153</a>, <a href="../hh/552.htm">552</a>).</p><p>[2] That to be sealed does not mean to be sealed, but to be brought into that state in which their quality can be known, so that they may be conjoined with those who are in a similar state, and separated from those who are in a dissimilar state, is signified by being marked, and by a mark, in the following passages.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"And Jehovah said," to the man clothed in linen, "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that mourn and that sigh for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. Go ye through the city after him, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_9_4.htm">9:4-6</a>).<p>The subject is here the separation of the good from the evil. To be marked (or sealed) on the forehead has the same signification as in this passage in the Apocalypse, that is, to be distinguished and separated from the evil, and conjoined to the good. The casting-out of the evil, and their condemnation are also afterwards described. Those who are in good are described by the men that cry and sigh for all the abominations done in the midst of the city of Jerusalem. Those who mourn and sigh over the abominations are such as are not in evils and the falsities therefrom; mourning and sighing over them signify aversion and grief on account of them, Jerusalem denoting the church, and the city doctrine. The casting-out of the evil and their condemnation are afterwards described, by the command that they should go through the city after him and smite, and that their eye should not spare. To smite and to kill signify to be damned, for spiritual death is damnation, and is signified in the Word by natural death.</p><p>[3] In Isaiah:<p>"He will come to gather together all nations and tongues, that they may come and see my glory. And I will set a mark among them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">66:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_19.htm">19</a>).<p>These words are spoken concerning the Lord, and the new church to be established by Him, and therefore concerning the new heaven and the new earth, as is evident from verse 22 of that chapter. By gathering together all nations and tongues, the same is signified as by gathering together the elect from the four winds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). To gather together signifies to call His own to Himself; nations signify those who are in good, and tongues, those who are in a life according to doctrine. To come and see the glory of the Lord, signifies to be enlightened in Divine Truth, and thus to experience heavenly joy; for the glory of the Lord signifies the Divine Truth, and the illustration and joy which it affords. To set a mark among them, signifies to distinguish and separate them from the evil, and conjoin them to the good.</p><p>[4] It is said of Cain, that Jehovah set a mark upon him, lest any should kill him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_4_15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>). Unless this interior fact of the Word be known, that by persons named in its historical parts, things are meant in the spiritual sense, or that every person there mentioned represents, and consequently signifies, something pertaining to the church and heaven, nothing further can be known than the literal history, which appears to be no more divine than other histories. But in every detail of the Word, both prophetical and historical, there is the Divine, which does not appear in the letter, except to those who are in the spiritual sense and acquainted with it. The interior spiritual fact contained in the history of Cain and Abel is that Abel represents the good of charity, and Cain the truth of faith; and this good and this truth are also called brethren in the Word. The truth of faith is called the first-born because truths which are afterwards to become the truths of faith, are first acquired and stored up in the memory, in order that good may take thence as from a storehouse what it can conjoin to itself, and thus cause them to be truths of faith. For truth is not of faith until man wills it and does it, and as far as man does this, the Lord conjoins him to Himself and to heaven, and from love flows in with good, and by means of good into the truths which he has acquired from his childhood, conjoins them to good, and causes them to become truths of faith. Before this has taken place, they are nothing more than cognitions and knowledges (scientiae), and these he believes as yet only in the same way that he believes what he hears from others which he can give up if he afterwards think differently, therefore this faith is the faith of another in himself, and not his own, and yet a man's faith must be his own, in order that it may remain with him after death. It becomes his own when he sees, wills, and does what he believes, for then it enters into the man, moulds his spirit, and becomes an integral part of his affection and thought; for the spirit of man in its essence is nothing else but his own affection and thought.</p><p> [5] That which is of affection is called good, and that which is of thought therefrom is called truth; nor does a man believe anything to be the truth, but that which belongs to his affection, that is, to the interior affection of his spirit. Wherefore what a man thinks from interior affection is his belief, and nothing else that he retains in his memory, whether from the Word or the doctrine of the church, from reading, from preaching, or from his own understanding, is faith, although he thinks that it is, and although it is declared and believed to be so at this day. This primary and first-begotten [principle] is represented and signified by Cain in the above historical part of the Word, for Cain was the first-begotten. When it is believed that such a faith saves man, and not the willing and doing of it, or a life according to it, then there arises the baneful heresy that faith alone saves whatever the life may be, and that there may be faith without life, although this is not faith, but merely knowledge exteriorly in the memory, and not interiorly in the life. If this be called faith it is historical faith, which is the faith one man has from another, and has no life in itself, until he who possesses it sees for himself that what he has received is true, and this first takes place when he wills and does it. When that heresy prevails, then charity, which is the good of life, is annihilated, and at length rejected as not essential to salvation. This was represented by Cain's slaying his brother Abel; for faith and charity or the truth of faith and the good of charity, are called brethren in the Word, as stated above.</p><p>[6] That Jehovah set a mark upon Cain lest he should be slain, signifies that he distinguished him from others, and preserved him, because saving faith cannot exist, unless historical faith precede, which is the knowledge of the things of the church and of heaven derived from others, in a word, the knowledge of such things as shall afterwards pertain to faith. For unless a man from his infancy received truths from the Word, from the doctrine of the church, or from preaching, he would possess none, and the Lord cannot act upon such a man, nor can he receive influx out of heaven from the Lord, for He operates and inflows by means of good into the truths which a man possesses and conjoins them, and thus makes charity and faith one. From these considerations it is evident what is signified by Jehovah setting a mark on Cain, lest any one should slay him, and by him that should slay him being avenged sevenfold. Besides, those who are only in historical faith, that is, in the knowledge of such things as belong to faith, - and such persons and faith are signified by Cain, - are also preserved, because they can teach others truths from the Word, for they teach from the memory.</p><p>[7] Since the forehead corresponds to the good of love, and therefore the Lord from His Divine Love looks upon angels and men in the forehead, as stated above, it was commanded that a plate of pure gold, upon which was engraved "Holiness to Jehovah," should be placed upon the mitre of Aaron on the forehead, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>"And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, Holiness to Jehovah. And thou shalt put it on a thread of purple, upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be, that it may be upon Aaron's forehead, and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9806.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9806</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9946.htm">9946</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10017.htm">10017</a>). "Purple" signifies the love of truth (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9466.htm">9466</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9687.htm">9687</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9833.htm">9833</a>); and the mitre signifies intelligence and wisdom (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9827.htm">9827</a>). </p><p>[8] Since the forehead signifies the good of love, the Israelites were therefore commanded to bind upon their foreheads the precept concerning love to Jehovah.<p>Thus in Moses:<p>"And thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And thou shalt bind these words for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets before thine eyes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_18.htm">11:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_13_9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_13_16.htm">16</a>).<p>It is said, that they should be for frontlets before the eyes, to represent the fact that the Lord looks upon angels and men in the forehead, because from Divine Love, and gives to angels and men the power to see Him from intelligence and wisdom, for the eyes signify the understanding. All man's understanding also is from the good of his love, and according to that which he receives from the Lord. That they should also bind them upon the hand represented the ultimates, because the hands are the ultimates of the powers of man's soul; therefore upon the forehead and upon the hand signifies in primaries and in ultimates. Primary and ultimate signify all, as may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_35.htm">22:35-38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_40.htm">40</a>). From this it is evident why kings at their coronation were in former times and are to-day anointed with oil upon the forehead and upon the hand. For kings formerly represented the Lord as to Divine Truth, and because this is received in the good of love which flows in from the Lord, therefore anointing was performed upon the forehead and upon the hand. The oil also, with which they were anointed, signifies the good of love. Therefore kings in the Word signify those who are in truths from good, and in an abstract sense truths from good; as may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_4.htm">9:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_3.htm">22:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_4.htm">4</a>).</p><p>[9] But on the other hand, the forehead signifies the evil of love which is opposite to the good of love, and therefore what is hard, obstinate, shameless and infernal. Thus in Isaiah, "hardness" is described in these words:<p>"Thou art hard, for thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy forehead brass" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">48:4</a>).<p>In Ezekiel "obstinacy."<p>"The house of Israel will not hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel are of an obstinate forehead and hard of heart" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_7.htm">3:7</a>).<p>In Jeremiah "shamelessness."<p>"Thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_3_3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>).<p>"Infernal" in the Apocalypse (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_16.htm">13:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_9.htm">14:9-11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_2.htm">16:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_5.htm">17:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>). For as the good of love is celestial, and therefore gentle, patient, and modest, so the evil opposite to that good is infernal, hard, obstinate, and shameless. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 427</h4><p>427. Till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads, signifies that those who are in truths from good are first to be separated. This is evident from the signification of "to seal," as being to distinguish and separate (of which presently); also from the signification of "the servants of God," as being those who are in truths from good (of which see above, n. <a href="../ae/6.htm">6</a>); also from the signification of "forehead," as being the good of love. It is from correspondence that "forehead" means the good of love; for all things pertaining to man in the whole body, whether within or without, correspond to heaven, for the universal heaven in the sight of the Lord is as one Man, so arranged as to correspond to each and all the things in man. The whole face, where the organs of sight, smell, hearing, and taste, are situated, corresponds to the affections and the thoughts therefrom in general, the eyes corresponding to the understanding, the nose to perception, the ears to hearkening and obedience, and the taste to the desire to know and be wise; but the forehead corresponds to the good of love, from which all these are, for it forms the highest part of the face, and directly encloses the front and primary part of the brain, which is the seat of man's intellect. This is why the Lord looks upon angels in the forehead, and the angels look to the Lord through the eyes; this is so because the forehead corresponds to the love, from which the Lord looks upon them, and the eyes correspond to the understanding from which they look to the Lord; for the Lord grants Himself to be seen through the influx of love into their understanding. (Respecting this see in the work on <a href="../hh/145.htm">Heaven and Hell 145</a>, <a href="../hh/151.htm">151</a>; and that The Universal Heaven in its Whole Complex answers to One Man, n. <a href="../hh/68.htm">68-86</a>; and that There is thence a Correspondence of all Things of Heaven with all Things of Man, n <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>.) This makes clear the signification of "being sealed on the forehead," namely, to be in the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and thereby to be distinguished and separated from those who are not in that love; for the Lord looks upon such in the forehead, and fills them with the good of love, from which they look to the Lord by thought from affection. The rest cannot be looked upon by the Lord in the forehead, for they turn away from Him and turn themselves to the opposite love, by which they are filled and attracted. (That everyone in the spiritual world, and man as well in respect to his spirit, turns the face to the ruling love, see in the work on <a href="../hh/17.htm">Heaven and Hell 17</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>, <a href="../hh/142.htm">142-144</a>, <a href="../hh/153.htm">153</a>, <a href="../hh/552.htm">552</a>)</p><p>[2] "To be sealed" means not to be sealed, but to be reduced to such a state that their quality may be recognized, and that they may thus be conjoined with those who are in a like state and separated from those who are in a dissimilar state. This is signified by "to be sealed," and by a "sign" in the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>Jehovah said to the man clothed in linen, Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and mark a sign upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and groan over all the abominations done in the midst thereof. And pass ye through the city after him and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; but come not near against any man upon whom is the sign (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_9_4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_9_6.htm">6</a>).<p>This also treats of the separation of the good from the evil; and "to mark on the forehead" has a similar signification as in this passage in Revelation, namely, to be distinguished and separated from the evil and to be conjoined to the good; the casting out and damnation of the evil are treated of afterwards. Those who are in good are described by those "that sigh and groan over all the abominations done in the midst of the city Jerusalem;" "those that sigh and groan over abominations" mean those who are not in evils and in falsities therefrom, "sighing and groaning over them" signifying aversion and grief because of them, "Jerusalem" meaning the church, and "city" the doctrine. Afterwards that they should "pass through the city after him and smite, and the eye should not spare," describes the casting out and damnation of the evil; "to smite and kill" signifying damnation, for spiritual death, which is damnation, is signified in the Word by natural death.</p><p>[3] In Isaiah:<p>He shall come for bringing together all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory. And I will set a sign upon them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_19.htm">19</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord, and of a new church to be established by Him, and thus of a new heaven and a new earth (as is evident from verse 22 that chapter). "Bringing together all nations and tongues" has a similar signification, as:<p>Gathering together the elect from the four winds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>);<p>"to gather together" signifies to receive to Himself those who are His own; "nations" signify those who are in good, and "tongues" those who are in a life according to doctrine; "to come and see the glory of the Lord" signifies to be illustrated by Divine truth, and thus to enjoy heavenly joy; for "the glory of the Lord" signifies Divine truth, and illustration and joy from it; "to set a sign upon them" signifies to distinguish and separate them from the evil and conjoin them to the good.</p><p>[4] It is written of Cain:<p>That Jehovah set a sign upon him that no one might slay him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_4_15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>).<p>He who does not know this arcanum of the Word that the persons named in its histories mean in the spiritual sense things, or that every person there mentioned represents and thence signifies something of the church and of heaven, can know nothing beyond the historical things of the letter, in which nothing more of the Divine appears than in other histories; and yet there is in the Word, both prophetical and historical, and in each and all things of it, something Divine that does not appear in the letter except to those who are in the spiritual sense and who know it. The spiritual arcanum in the history of Cain and Abel is this: "Abel" represents the good of charity, and "Cain" the truth of faith, and that good and that truth are called in the Word "brethren;" and the truth of faith is called "the firstborn" because the truths that are afterwards to become truths of faith are first acquired and stored up in the memory, that from it, as from a storehouse, good may draw what it may conjoin to itself and make the truths to be truths of faith. For truth does not become of faith until man wills it and does it; but so far as man does this the Lord conjoins him to Himself and to heaven, and from love flows in with good, and through good into the truths that the man has acquired from childhood, and conjoins them to good and makes them to be truths of faith; before this they are nothing but the cognitions and knowledges, in which as yet man has no other faith than such as he has in things heard from another, from which he can withdraw if he afterwards thinks differently; therefore this faith is not his own but that of another in him; and yet if a man's faith is to remain with him after death it must be his own faith; and it becomes his own when he sees, wills, and does what he believes, for it then enters into the man and forms his spirit, and comes to be of his affection and thought; for man's spirit in its essence is nothing but his affection and thought.</p><p>[5] That which is of the affection is called good, and that which is of the thought therefrom is called truth; and man believes nothing to be true except what is of his affection, but of the interior affection that pertains to his spirit; consequently that which a man thinks from interior affection is his faith, and whatever other things he holds in his memory, whether he has drawn them from the Word or from the doctrine of the church, by reading or from preachings, or from his own understanding, are not faith, however much he thinks that they are, and it is at present said and believed that they are. This first-begotten and primary thing is what "Cain" represents and signifies in this history, for Cain was the first-begotten. When this, and not willing and doing the truth, that is, living according to it, is believed to be the faith that saves man, then there springs up a pernicious heresy that faith alone saves, whatever the life may be, and that there may be faith apart from the life; and yet this is not faith, but mere knowledge residing outside of man in his memory, and not within him in the life. If this is called faith it is historical faith, which is having in oneself another's faith, and such a faith does not receive life until the man sees that what he has thus imbibed is true, and this he first sees when he wills and does it. When that heresy prevails, charity, which is the good of life, is destroyed, and at length rejected as not essential to salvation. This was represented by Cain's slaying his brother Abel; for faith and charity, or the truth of faith and the good of charity, are called in the Word "brethren," as was said above.</p><p>[6] That "Jehovah set a sign upon Cain lest he should be slain" signifies that He distinguished him from others and preserved him, because saving faith cannot be given unless historical faith precedes, and this is knowing from others the things of the church and heaven; in a word, it is a knowledge of such things as faith afterwards consists of; for unless man from infancy imbibed truths from the Word, or from the doctrine of the church, or from preachings, he would be empty, and into an empty man no operation could fall, and no influx out of heaven from the Lord could come, for the Lord operates and flows in through good into truths with man, and conjoins these, and thus makes charity and faith to be one. From this can be seen the signification of "Jehovah set a sign upon Cain that no one might slay him, and that whosoever should slay him vengeance should be taken on him sevenfold." Moreover, those who are in mere historical faith, that is, in a knowledge of such things as constitute faith, who are the persons or which is the faith meant by "Cain," these are preserved also because they can teach truths from the Word to others, which they do from memory.</p><p>[7] Because the "forehead" corresponds to the good of love, and therefore the Lord from Divine love looks upon angels and men in the forehead, as was said above, it was commanded that a plate of pure gold, upon which was written "Holiness to Jehovah," should be placed upon the miter of Aaron on the forehead, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>Thou shalt make a plate, pure gold, and grave upon it with the engravings of a signet, Holiness to Jehovah.

And thou shalt bind these words for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets before thine eyes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6</a>), 8; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_18.htm">11:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_13_9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_13_16.htm">16</a>).<p>It is said "they shall be for frontlets before the eyes," as a representation that the Lord looks upon angels and men in the forehead, because from Divine love, and grants to angels and men to look at Him from intelligence and wisdom, for the "eyes" signify the understanding, and all man's understanding is from the good of his love and according to that which he receives from the Lord. That they bound these words upon the hand also represented ultimate things, because the hands are the ultimates of the powers of man's soul; therefore "upon the forehead and upon the hand" signifies in things first and last, and "first and last" signifies all things (as may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_35.htm">Matthew 22:35-38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_40.htm">40</a>).<p>This also makes clear why kings, in former times and also at present, when crowned, were anointed with oil upon the forehead and upon the hand, and what this signifies; for kings formerly represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and because this is received in the good of love that flows in from the Lord, therefore they were anointed upon the forehead and upon the hand, the "oil" also with which they were anointed signifying the good of love. This is why kings in the Word signify those who are in truths from good, and in an abstract sense truths from good (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_3.htm">22:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_4.htm">4</a>).</p><p>[9] But on the contrary, the "forehead" signifies that which is opposite to the good of love, namely, the evil of love, and thus what is hard, obstinate, shameless, and infernal. It signifies what is hard in Isaiah:<p>Thou art hard, for thy neck is a sinew of iron, and thy forehead brass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>).<p>It signifies what is stubborn in Ezekiel:<p>The house of Israel will not hearken unto Me; for the whole house of Israel are stubborn in forehead and hard in heart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_8.htm">8</a>).<p>It signifies what is shameless in Jeremiah:<p>The forehead of a harlot remained to thee, thou didst refuse to be ashamed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_3_3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>).<p>It signifies what is infernal in Revelation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_9.htm">14:9-11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_2.htm">16:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_5.htm">17:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>); for as the good of love is heavenly, and thence mild, patient, and modest, so the evil opposite to that good is infernal, hard, stubborn, and shameless. </p>

Arcanum spirituale in historico de Caino et Abele est hoc: Abel ibi repraesentat bonum charitatis et Cainus verum fidei; id bonum et hoc verum etiam in Verbo vocantur "fratres"; ac verum fidei "primogenitus", ex causa quia vera, quae postea fient fidei, primum acquiruntur et reponuntur in memoria, ut bonum inde sicut ex promptuario hauriat quod sibi conjungat, ac faciat ut sint fidei. Verum enim non prius fit fidei quam cum homo vult illud et facit illud; et quantum homo id facit, tantum Dominus conjungit illum Sibi et caelo, ac influit ex amore cum bono, ac per bonum in vera quae homo a pueritia acquisivit, ac conjungit illa bono, ac facit ut sint fidei: prius non sint nisi quam cognitiones et scientiae; quibus homo adhuc non fidem habet aliam quam sicut rebus auditis ex alio, a quibus recedere potest si aliter postea cogitat; quare illa fides est fides alterius in se, et non sua; et usque fides sua erit apud hominem, ut maneat illum post mortem; et tunc fit sua, quando id quod credit, videt, vult et facit, tunc enim intrat in hominem, et format spiritum ejus, et fit affectionis et cogitationis ejus; spiritus enim hominis in sua essentia non est nisi quam sua affectio et cogitatio.<p>[5] Quod affectionis est, hoc vocatur bonum; et quod inde cogitationis est, hoc vocatur verum; homo nec aliud credit verum esse quam quod est affectionis ejus, sed interioris affectionis quae est spiritus ejus: quare quod homo ex interiore affectione cogitat, hoc ejus fides est; et reliqua quaecunque in memoria sua tenet, sive illa hauserit ex Verbo, sive ex doctrina ecclesiae per lectionem, sive ex praedicatione, sive ex proprio intellectu, non sunt fides, utcunque putat quod sit, et dicitur ac creditur hodie quod sit. Hoc primogenitum et primitivum est quod Cainus in historico illo repraesentat et significat, nam Cainus erat primogenitus. Tale cum creditur esse fides quae salvat hominem, ac non velle illud et facere illud, hoc est, vivere secundum illud, existit haeresis damnosa quod sola fides salvet qualiscunque vita est, et quod detur fides absque vita; cum tamen id non est fides, sed modo scientia residens extra hominem in ejus memoria, et non intra illum in vita; et si illud vocatur fides, est fides historica, quae fides est fides alterius apud se; et non prius vitam accipit, quam cum id quod hausit ipse videt quod verum sit, et tunc primum videt cum vult illud et facit illud. Cum illa haeresis invalescit, tunc annihilatur charitas quae est bonum vitae, et tandem rejicitur sicut non essentialis ad salutem: hoc repraesentatum est per quod Cainus occiderit Abelem fratrem suum; fides enim et charitas, seu verum fidei et bonum charitatis, dicuntur "fratres" in Verbo, ut supra dictum est.<p>[6] Quod "Jehovah posuerit Caino signum ne occideretur", significat quod distinxerit ab aliis, et quod conservaverit, quia fides salvifica non dari potest nisi praecedat fides historica, quae est cognitio rerum ecclesiae et caeli ab aliis; verbo, est scientia talium quae postea fidei erunt; nisi enim homo ex infantia hauriat vera ex Verbo, vel ex doctrina ecclesiae, vel ex praedicatione, foret vacuus; et in hominem vacuum non cadit operatio et non datur influxus e caelo a Domino; operatur enim et influit Dominus per bonum in vera apud hominem, et conjungit illa, et facit ut charitas et fides unum sint: ex his constare potest quid significat quod "Jehovah posuerit Caino signum, ne quis occiderit illum, et qui occiderit septuplum vindicaretur." Praeterea illi qui solum in fide historica sunt, hoc est, in scientia talium quae fidei, qui sunt "Cainus" seu quae est "Cainus", conservantur etiam quia docere possunt alios vera ex Verbo, docent enim ex memoria.<p>[7] Quoniam "frons" correspondet bono amoris, ac ideo Dominus ex Divino Amore aspicit angelos et homines in fronte, ut supra dictum est, ideo mandatum est, ut bractea ex puro auro, super qua scriptum esset "Sanctitas Jehovae", poneretur super cidari Aharonis e regione frontis, de qua ita apud Mosen,<p>"Facies bracteam, aurum purum, et sculpes super illa sculpturis sigilli, Sanctitas Jehovae; et pones eam super filo hyacinthini, ... e regione facierum cidaris erit, ut sit super fronte Aharonis, ... sitque super fronte ejus jugiter, in beneplacitum <sup>2</sup></p><p>illis coram Jehovah" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_427/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_36-38" target=_top>Exodus 28:36-38</a>):<p>Aharon enim ut summus sacerdos repraesentabat Dominum quoad bonum Divini Amoris; et inde vestes ejus repraesentabant talia quae procedunt ex illo amore; cidaris repraesentabat intelligentiam et sapientiam, ac regio anterior ejus amorem, ex quo intelligentia et Sapientia; ideo ibi bractea ex auro puro erat posita super filo hyacinthini, super qua sculptum "Sanctitas Jehovae": "aurum purum" ex quo bractea significat bonum amoris caelestis; "hyacinthinum" ex quo filum super quo bractea, significat bonum amoris spiritualis (amor spiritualis est amor veri); "sculptura sigilli" significat permanentiam in aeternum; "Sanctitas Jehovae" significat Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum, ex quo omne sanctum caeli et ecclesiae procedit; haec erant "super fronte cidaris" quae super capite Aharonis, quia "cidaris" significat simile quod "caput", nempe Divinam Sapientiam, et "frons" Divinum Bonum Amoris.
