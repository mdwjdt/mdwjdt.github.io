<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1160</h4><p>1160. And thou shalt find them no more.- This signifies that they are destroyed for ever, is evident from the signification of not finding those things, namely, fat and splendid things, by which are signified goods and propitious things therefrom, and truths and magnificent things therefrom, as denoting that they are destroyed for ever, for things which are found no more are for ever destroyed.</p><p>[2] Continuation.- The kind of profanation described above is meant by the following words in Matthew:<p>"When the unclean spirit goeth out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, but finding none; then he saith, I will return to the house from whence I came forth; and when he is come he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished; then he goeth away, and adjoins to himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in they dwell there; and the latter things of that man become worse than the first" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">12:43</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_44.htm">44</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_45.htm">45</a>).<p>In this passage the conversion of a man by the departure of the unclean spirit from him is described; and his return to evils, and his consequent profanation, is denoted by the unclean spirit returning with seven spirits worse than himself.</p><p>[3] Similarly by these words in John: Jesus said to the man who was healed at the pool of Bethesda,<p>"Behold thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worst thing come upon thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_14.htm">5:14</a>).<p>And by these words in the same evangelist:<p>"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should turn and I should heal them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_40.htm">12:40</a>).<p>Lest they should turn and be healed, signifies, lest they should become profane. It would have been so with the Jews (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>); therefore they were forbidden to eat fat and blood (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_3_17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_7_23.htm">7:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_7_25.htm">25</a>), by which their profanation of what is holy was signified because they were of such a character. The Lord also, by His Divine Providence, guards most carefully against the existence of this kind of profanation. And for this purpose He separates in man holy things from those that are not holy, lays up the holy things in the interior of his mind, and raises them up to Himself; but those things that are not holy he stores up in the exteriors, and turns them to the world; and therefore, holy things are capable of being separated from those things that are not holy, and man can thus be saved. This cannot be effected while goods and evils are mingled together. That those who remain in faith and love even unto death, will have a crown of life, the Lord teaches in the Apocalypse (chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_10.htm">2:10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1160</h4><p>1160. And thou shalt find them no more, signifies that they are destroyed forever. This is evident from the signification of "not finding them" (that is, things fat and splendid, which signify things good and thus satisfying and things true and thus grand), as being that they have been destroyed forever, for things found no more are destroyed forever.<p>(Continuation)</p><p>[2] One kind of profanation described above is meant by these words in Matthew:<p>When the unclean spirit goeth out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest and finding it not. Then he saith, I will return to the house whence I went forth. When he cometh he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then he goeth away, and taketh to himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in they dwell there; and the latter things of that man become worse than the first (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a>).<p>This describes the conversion of a man by the departure of the unclean spirit from him; and his return to evils and the consequent profanation is described by the unclean spirit returning with seven spirits worse than himself.</p><p>[3] Likewise by these words in John:<p>Jesus said to him who was healed at the pool of Bethesda, Behold thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_14.htm">John 5:14</a>).<p>Also by these words in the same:<p>He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and should convert themselves and I should heal them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_40.htm">John 12:40</a>).<p>"Lest they should convert themselves and be healed" signifies lest they should become profane. Thus would it have been with the Jews (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>); and this is why they were forbidden to eat fat and blood (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_3_17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_7_23.htm">7:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_7_25.htm">25</a>), for this signified their profanation of what is holy in consequence of their being such. Moreover, the Lord by his Divine providence guards with the greatest care against this kind of profanation; and lest this exist, He separates the holy things with man from those that are not holy, and stores up the holy things in the interiors of his mind, and raises them up to Himself; while the things not holy He stores up in the exteriors, and turns them to the world. Thus holy things can be separated from the unholy, and thus man can be saved. But this cannot be done when goods and evils are mixed together. That those who continue in faith and love even unto death will have the crown of life, the Lord teaches in Revelation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_26.htm">26</a>). </p>

"Et amplius non invenies illa." - Quod significet deperdita in aeternum, constat ex significatione "non invenire illa", nempe pinguia et splendida, per quae significantur bona et inde fausta, ac vera et inde magnifica, quod sit quod deperdita sint in aeternum; nam quae non inveniuntur amplius, illa in aeternum perdita sunt.<p>[2] (Continuatio.)<p>Supradictae profanationis genus intelligitur per haec apud Matthaeum,<p>"Quando immundus spiritus exit ex homine, perambulat arentia loca, quaerens requiem, sed non invenit; tunc dicit, Revertar ad domum unde exivi; dum pervenit et invenit illam vacuam, et scopis purgatam, et ornatam sibi, tunc abit, et adjungit sibi septem alios spiritus pejores se ipso, et ingressi habitant ibi; atque fiunt posteriora hominis..pejora primis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_43-45" target=_top>12:43-45</a>):<p>describitur ibi conversio hominis per exitum spiritus immundi ab illo, ac reversio ad mala et inde profanatio per reditum cum septem spiritibus illo pejoribus.<p>[3] Pariter per haec apud Johannem,<p>Jesus dixit ad sanatum in lacu Bethesda, "Vide sanus factus es; ne amplius pecca, ne pejus tibi fiat" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_14" target=_top>5:14</a>):<p>et per haec apud eundem,<p>"Occaecavit illorum oculos, et obturavit illorum cor, ut non videant oculis et intelligant corde, et convertant se et sanem illos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_40" target=_top>12:40</a> <sup>1</sup></p><p>):<p>"ne se convertant et sanentur", significat ne fiant profani; ita fuisset cum Judaeis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_45" target=_top>Matthaeus 12:45</a>); quapropter illis prohibitum fuit comedere pinguedinem et sanguinem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_3_17" target=_top>Leviticus 3:17</a>; cap, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_7_23" target=_top>7:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_7_25" target=_top>25</a>), per quod significabatur profanatio sancti ab illis quia tales.
