<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 189</h4><p>189. For I have not found thy works full before God. That this signifies that otherwise the Divine is not in moral life, is evident from the signification of works, as being the things belonging to life (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/185.htm">185</a>); in this case moral life is the subject treated of - and from the signification of works not being full before God, as being that the Divine is not in them. The things pertaining to moral life, here signified by works, are said to be full before God when they are from a spiritual origin, but not full when they are not from that origin. For a moral life, which is the external life of man, must be either from a spiritual origin, or from an origin not spiritual; it cannot be from both, that is, partly from one origin and partly from the other, or partly from heaven and partly from hell, because this would be to serve two masters, God and Mammon; for in this case a man would be lukewarm, neither cold nor hot. Therefore, works must be either full before God, or they are nothing in His sight; hence it is that by I have not found thy works full before God, is signified that the Divine is not in their moral life. The meaning is the same whether we say moral life from a spiritual origin, or from the Divine, because all spiritual life is from the Divine, for the Spiritual is called the proceeding Divine, and is the Divine in heaven; and because all the angels of heaven are recipients of it, therefore they are spiritual; the case is similar with men who receive Divine truth in faith and life. (What the Spiritual is, may be seen in <a href="../njhd/48.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 48</a>, <a href="../njhd/49.htm">49</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 189</h4><p>189. For I have not found thy works full before God, signifies that otherwise the Divine is not in the moral life. This is evident from the signification of "works," as being the things of life (of which see above, n. <a href="../ae/185.htm">185</a>); here of moral life, because that is here treated of; also from the signification of "not full before God," as being that the Divine is not in that life. The things of moral life, which are here signified by "works," are said to be "full before God," when they are from a spiritual origin, but "not full" when they are not from that origin; for moral life, which is the external life of man, must be either from a spiritual origin or from an origin not spiritual; it is not permitted to be from both, that is, something of it from one origin and something from the other, or something from heaven and something from hell, since this would be to "serve two masters, God and Mammon;" and then the man is "lukewarm, neither cold nor hot." "Works," therefore, must be either "full before God," or they are nothing before God. This is why "I have not found thy works full before God" signifies that the Divine is not in the moral life. The meaning is the same whether it is said a moral life from a spiritual origin or from the Divine, since all spiritual life is from the Divine, for the spiritual means the same as the proceeding Divine, and is the Divine truth in heaven; and all angels of heaven, because they are recipients of this, are spiritual; and the like is true of men who receive Divine truth in faith and life. (What the spiritual is, see <a href="../njhd/48.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 48-49</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 189 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>189. "Non enim inveni tua opera plena coram Deo." - Quod significet quod alioqui non Divinum sit in vita morali, constat ex significatione "operum", quod sint illa quae vitae (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_189/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_185" target=_top>185</a>), hic vitae moralis, quia de illa agitur; ex significatione "plena coram Deo", quod sit quod non Divinum in illa. Illa quae sunt vitae moralis, quae hic per "opera" significantur, dicuntur "plena coram Deo" quando ex origine spirituali sunt, at "non plena" quando non sunt ex illa origine; nam vita moralis, quae est externa vita hominis, vel erit ex origine spirituali vel ex origine non spirituali; non licet ut sit ex utraque, hoc est, aliquid ejus ex una origine et aliquid ex altera, seu aliquid ex caelo et aliquid ex inferno, quia hoc foret "servire duobus dominis, Deo et mammoni", et tunc homo est "tepidus, non frigidus nec calidus"; quare opera erunt vel "plena coram Deo", vel sunt nulla coram Deo: inde est quod per "non inveni tua opera plena coram Deo", significetur quod non Divinum sit in vita morali. Sive dicas vitam moralem ex origine spirituali, sive ex Divino idem est, quoniam omnis vita spiritualis est ex Divino; spirituale enim dicitur Divinum procedens, et est Divinum Verum in caelo; et quia omnes angeli caeli sunt receptiones ejus, ideo illi spirituales sunt; similiter homines qui recipiunt Divinum Verum fide et vita. (Quid spirituale, videatur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_189/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_48" target=_top>48</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_189/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_49" target=_top>49</a>.) </p>
