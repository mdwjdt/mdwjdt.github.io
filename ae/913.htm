<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 913</h4><p>913. Verses 17-19. And another angel went out from the temple, which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel went out from the altar, having power over fire; and he cried with a great cry, to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the vintage of the clusters of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the vineyard of the earth, and he cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.<p>"And another angel went out from the temple, which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle," signifies manifestation from the Lord concerning the devastation of the church as to Divine truth such as exists in heaven, after exploration.<p>"And another angel went out from the altar," signifies manifestation from the Lord concerning the devastation of the church as to the good of love and charity; "having power over fire," signifies thus as to celestial and spiritual love; "and he cried with a great cry," signifies annunciation after exploration or visitation; "saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the vintage of the clusters of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe," signifies that the gathering and separation of the good from the evil may take place, because there are no longer truths of faith, since there is no spiritual good, which is charity.<p>"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the vineyard of the earth," signifies that this was done; "and cast into the great wine-press of the wrath of God," signifies the falsification of the Word as to all spiritual truth, and thence damnation, because there is no spiritual good, which is charity. </p>
