<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 415</h4><p>415. CHAPTER 7.<p>1. AND after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.<p>2. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,<p>3. Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.<p>4. And I heard the number of them that were sealed; a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe [of the sons] of Israel.<p>5. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.<p>6. Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.<p>7. Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.<p>8. Of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.<p>9. After this I saw and behold a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation, and of [all] tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.<p>10. And they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.<p>11. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders and the four animals, and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,<p>12. Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God unto the ages of the ages. Amen.<p>13. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are clothed with white robes, who are they, and whence came they?<p>14. And I said unto him, My Lord, thou knowest. And he said unto me, These are they who come out of great tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and make them white in the blood of the Lamb.<p>15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he who sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them.<p>16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.<p>17. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe every tear from their eyes.<p>THE EXPLANATION.<p>Verse 1. And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. "And after these things I saw" signifies a new perception concerning the state of heaven before the Last Judgment; "four angels standing on the four corners of the earth," signifies the Divine proceeding from the Lord in the whole spiritual world; "holding the four winds of the earth," signifies the modification of its influx; "that the wind should not blow," signifies, lest the good should be hurt, and the evil rejected before the day; "on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree," signifies, everywhere in the spiritual world, even to its ultimates, in regard to those who have any perception. </p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 415 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>415. CAPUT VII.<p>1. Post haec vidi quatuor angelos stantes super quatuor angulis terrae, retinentes quatuor ventos terrae, ut non flaret ventus super terram, neque super mare, neque super ullam arborem.<p>2. Et vidi alium angelum ascendentem ab ortu solis, habentem sigillum Dei vivi; et clamavit voce magna quatuor angelis, quibus datum eis damno afficere terram et mare.<p>3. Dicens, Ne damno afficiatis terram neque mare, neque arbores, usque dum signaverimus servos Dei nostri super frontibus eorum.<p>4. Et audivi numerum signatorum, centum quadraginta quatuor millia signati ex omni tribu ( <sup>1</sup></p><p>filiorum) Israelis.<p>5. Ex tribu Jehudae duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Reubenis duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Gadis duodecim millia signati.<p>6. Ex tribu Ascheris duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Naphthali duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Menassis duodecim millia signati.<p>7. Ex tribu Simeonis duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Levi duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Isascharis duodecim millia signati.<p>8. Ex tribu Sebulonis duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Josephi duodecim millia signati; ex tribu Benjaminis duodecim millia signati.<p>9. Post haec vidi, et ecce turba multa, quam numerare nemo poterat, ex omni gente et tribubus et populis et linguis, stantes coram throno et coram Agno, induti stolis albis, et palmae in manibus eorum.<p>10. Et clamantes voce magna, dicentes, Salus Deo nostro sedenti super throno et Agno.<p>11. Et omnes angeli stabant circum thronum, et seniores et quatuor animalia, et ceciderunt coram throno super facies suas et adoraverunt Deum.<p>12. Dicentes, Amen, benedictio et gloria et sapientia et gratiarum actio et honor et potentia et robur Deo nostro in saecula saeculorum; amen.<p>13. Et respondit unus ex senioribus, dicens mihi, Hi induti stolis albis quinam sunt, et unde venerunt?<p>14. Et dixi illi, Domine, tu nosti: et dixit mihi, Hi sunt qui veniunt ex tribulatione magna, et laverunt stolas suas et dealbaverunt stolas suas in sanguine Agni.<p>15. Propter hoc sunt coram throno Dei, et serviunt Ipsi die et nocte in templo Ipsius, et Sedens super throno habitabit super illis.<p>16. Non esurient amplius nec sitient amplius, neque cadet super illos sol neque ullus aestus.<p>17. Quoniam Agnus, qui in medio throni, pascet eos, et deducet eos ad vivos fontes aquarum; et absterget Deus omnem lachrymam ab oculis illorum.<p>EXPLICATIO.<p>VERSUS 1.<p>"Et post haec vidi quatuor angelos stantes super quatuor angulis terrae, retinentes quatuor ventos terrae, ut non flaret ventus super terram, neque super mare, neque super omnem arborem."<p>1.
