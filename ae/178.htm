<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 178</h4><p>178. Even as I received of my Father. This signifies comparatively as the Lord did from His Divine, when He glorified His Human; for He dissipated all evils and falsities from the Human which He had from the mother. By Father is here meant the Divine in Him, or which He had from conception; for this was one with the Father, as He Himself declares. It is said comparatively, because as the Lord glorified His Human so He regenerates man; that is, as He united His Divine to the Human and the Human to the Divine, so He conjoins the internal to the external and the external to the internal, with man. But, because this arcanum cannot be explained to the apprehension in a few words, therefore let the reader consult and see what has been shown concerning it in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem and in Arcana Coelestia; in <a href="../njhd/280.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 280-297</a>; and in Arcana Coelestia, in the passages thence cited, ibid., n. <a href="../njhd/185.htm">185</a>, <a href="../njhd/298.htm">298-307</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 178</h4><p>178. As I also have received from my Father, signifies comparatively as the Lord did from His Divine Human, when He glorified His Human, namely, that He dissipated all evils and falsities arising from the human that He had from the mother. By "the Father" here the Divine in Himself, or that which He had from conception, is meant, for this Divine was one with the Father, as He declares. It is said comparatively, for as the Lord glorified His Human, so He regenerates man; that is, as He united His Divine to the Human and the Human to the Divine, so He conjoins the internal to the external and the external to the internal with man. (But as this arcanum cannot be explained in a few words so as to be understood, consult what has been shown respecting it in <a href="../njhd/280.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 280-297</a>, and in the passages cited from the Arcana Coelestia in that work, n. <a href="../njhd/185.htm">185</a>, <a href="../njhd/298.htm">298-307</a>, in which it is fully explained.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 178 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>178. "Sicut et Ego accepi a Patre meo." - Quod significet comparative sicut Dominus a Divino suo cum glorificavit Humanum suum, nempe quod dissipaverit omnia mala et falsa ex Humano quod Ipsi a matre fuit (, non ad captum paucis exponi potest): per "Patrem" hic intelligitur Divinum in Ipso, seu quod Ipsi a conceptione fuit, nam hoc Divinum unum erat cum Patre, ut Ipse dicit. Comparative dicitur, quia Dominus sicut glorificavit Humanum suum, ita regenerat hominem; hoc est, sicut Ipse univit Divinum suum Humano ac Humanum Divino, ita conjungit internum externo et externum interno apud hominem. (Sed quia hoc arcanum non ad captum paucis exponi potest, ideo consulantur et videantur illa quae de eo in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, et in Arcanis Caelestibus, ostensa sunt, ubi plene expositum est; in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_178/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_280" target=_top>280-297</a>; et in Arcanis Caelestibus in locis in Doctrina illa inde citatis, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_178/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_185" target=_top>185</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_178/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_298" target=_top>298-307</a>.) </p>
