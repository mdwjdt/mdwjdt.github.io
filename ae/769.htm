<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 769</h4><p>769. Who keep the commandments of God.- That this signifies with those who live the life of faith, which is charity, is evident from the signification of keeping the commandments of God, as denoting to live according to the commandments of the Word; and as that life is a life of faith, and a life of faith is charity, therefore to keep the commandments of God signifies to live a life of faith, which is charity. A life of faith denotes charity towards the neighbour, because faith means the faith of the Word, thus the faith of truth in the Word and from the Word, while charity signifies the love for good and truth, spiritual, moral, and civil; and as that which a man loves he also wills, and what he wills this he does, therefore to keep the commandments of God signifies to live the life of faith, which is charity.</p><p>[2] From these things it is evident, that all those who separate faith from charity are entirely ignorant of the nature of both faith and charity; for their idea of faith is that it consists of all those matters contained in the memory which they accept because they have heard them from learned men. A faith of this kind, however, is merely traditional faith, for they do not see that a thing is so except from another, and what one sees only from another may be confirmed both from the sense of the letter of the Word misunderstood, and by reasonings from appearances and scientifics (scientifica), although it may be a falsity in direct opposition to the truth. When such a faith is confirmed it becomes a persuasive faith; but neither this nor traditional faith is a spiritual faith, nor consequently is it a saving faith, for such faith has as yet no life from the Lord. But that a man may receive this life he must live according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, for to live according to the commandments is the same thing as to live from the Lord, because the Lord is the Word and in the Word. Such a life is a life of faith, which is charity, and then its affection becomes charity, and thought from that affection becomes faith. For all man's thought derives its life from affection, for no one can think without affection; when therefore a man's affection becomes spiritual his thought also becomes spiritual; consequently, as is a man's charity, so is his faith. It is therefore evident that charity and faith act as one like affection and thought, or what is the same thing, like will and understanding; for affection belongs to the will, and thought to the understanding, consequently they make one in act, like good and truth. It is therefore plain that to live according to the Lord's commandments from the Word, or to keep the commandments of God, means to live a life of faith, which is charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 769</h4><p>769. Who keep the commandments of God, signifies with those who live the life of faith, which is charity. This is evident from the signification of "keeping the commandments of God," as being to live according to the commandments in the Word; and as that life is a life of faith, and a life of faith is charity, therefore "keeping the commandments of God" signifies to live the life of faith, which is charity. The life of faith is charity towards the neighbor, because faith means faith in the Word, thus faith in the truth that is in the Word and from the Word, and charity means the love of good and truth, spiritual, moral, and civil; and as that which man loves he also wills, and what he wills he does, therefore "keeping the commandments of God" signifies to live the life of faith, which is charity.</p><p>[2] From this it can be seen that all those who separate faith from charity know not what faith is or what charity is, for they have no other idea of faith than as being everything of the memory that is believed because they have heard it from learned men; and yet such faith is historical faith, for they do not see whether a thing is so, except because someone else has said it; and what is seen from another can be confirmed both by the sense of the letter of the Word misunderstood and by reasonings from appearances and knowledges [scientifica], although it may be a falsity directly opposed to the truth.<p>When this is confirmed it becomes a persuasive faith; but neither this faith nor historical faith is a spiritual faith, thus not a saving faith, for such faith has as yet no life from the Lord in it. That a man may receive that life he must live according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, for living according to these commandments is the same as living from the Lord, because the Lord is the Word and is in the Word. Such a life is the life of faith, which is charity; and then its affection becomes charity, and thought from that affection becomes faith; for all man's thought derives its life wholly from affection, since no one can think without affection; therefore when a man's affection becomes spiritual his thought also becomes spiritual; consequently such as a man's charity is such is his faith. From this it can be seen that charity and faith, like affection and thought, or what is the same, like will and understanding, act as one, for affection is of the will and thought is of the understanding, consequently they act as one as goods and truths do. Thence it is clear that to live according to the commandments of the Lord from the Word, or "to keep the commandments of God," means to live the life of faith, which is charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 769 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>769. "Observantibus mandata Dei." - Quod significet apud illos qui vitam fidei, quae est charitas, vivunt, constat ex significatione "observare mandata Dei", quod sit vivere secundum praecepta in Verbo; et quia illa vita est vita fidei, et quia vita fidei est charitas, ideo per "observare mandata Dei" significatur vivere vitam fidei, quae est charitas; quod vita fidei sit charitas erga proximum, est quia per fidem intelligitur fides Verbi, ita fides veri in Verbo et ex Verbo, et per charitatem significatur amor boni et veri spiritualis, moralis et civilis; et quia id quod homo amat, etiam vult, et quod vult id facit, inde per "observare mandata Dei" significatur vitam fidei, quae est charitas, vivere.<p>[2] Ex his constare potest quod omnes qui separant fidem a charitate, non sciant quid fides nec quid charitas; de fide enim non aliam ideam habent quam sicut de omni re memoriae, quae creditur quia audiverunt a viris eruditis; quae tamen fides est fides historica, nam non vident num ita sit, nisi quam ex alio; et quod videtur ex alio, hoc confirmari potest tam ex Verbi sensu litterae non intellecto quam ex ratiociniis ex apparentiis et scientificis, tametsi foret falsum vero oppositum; et cum confirmatum est, fit fides persuasiva; sed haec fides, et fides historica, non est fides spiritualis, ita non fides salvans, nondum enim vitam a Domino habet: ut vero homo hanc vitam accipiat, vivet secundum praecepta Domini in Verbo; nam vivere secundum illa est vivere a Domino, quia Dominus est Verbum et in Verbo; et haec vita est vita fidei, quae est charitas, et tunc affectio ejus fit charitas, et cogitatio ex illa affectione fit fides; omnis enim cogitatio hominis trahit vitam suam ex affectione, nam cogitare absque affectione nemo potest; quare cum affectio hominis fit spiritualis, tunc etiam cogitatio ejus fit spiritualis; consequenter qualis charitas est apud hominem, talis est ejus fides: inde constare potest quod charitas et fides, unum agant sicut affectio et cogitatio, seu quod idem, sicut voluntas et intellectus, nam affectio est voluntatis et cogitatio est intellectus; consequenter unum agunt sicut bonum et verum. Inde patet quod vivere secundum praecepta Domini ex Verbo, seu "observare mandata Dei", significet vivere vitam fidei quae est charitas. </p>
