<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 562</h4><p>562. And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss. That this signifies, that they received influx from the hell, where are those who are in the falsities of evil, and purely sensual, is evident from the signification of a king, as denoting truth from good, and in the opposite sense, as in this case, falsity from evil; see above (n. <a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>); and from the signification of the angel of the abyss, as denoting the hell where the falsities of evil are; for by the angel is not meant a single angel, but the hell in which all such are. That an angel in the Word means entire angelic societies which are in a similar good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/90.htm">90</a>, <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../ae/307.htm">307</a>); hence also by an angel in the opposite sense are signified infernal societies that are in similar evil. That the hells where those are who are in the falsities of evil, and who are utterly sensual, are here meant, is because the angel is called the angel of the abyss, the abyss denoting the hell where such are; see above (n. <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>); and because this is said of the locusts, which signify men who have become utterly sensual through infernal falsities; see above (n. <a href="../ae/543.htm">543</a>). The reason why having over them a king signifies that [hell] and the receiving of influx therefrom, is, that all evils, and the falsities thence, are from hell, and because all who are in evils and thence in falsities, are ruled and led of the hells, wherefore hell is to them like a king who rules over them, and to whom they yield obedience. Because this is the result of influx at a time when they live in the world, and the efflux thence is what leads, therefore by having a king over them is signified to receive influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 562</h4><p>562. Verse 11. And they had over them a king, the angel of the abyss, signifies that they received influx from the hell where those are who are in the falsities of evil and are merely sensual. This is evident from the signification of a "king," as being truth from good, and in the contrary sense, as here, falsity from evil (See above, n. <a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>); and from the signification of "the angel of the abyss," as being the hell in which there are the falsities of evil; for "angel" here does not mean a single angel, but the hell in which such are. That an "angel" means in the Word entire angelic societies which are in like good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/90.htm">90</a>, <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../ae/307.htm">307</a>); therefore also an "angel" in the contrary sense signifies the infernal societies which are in like evil. The hells where those are who are in the falsities of evil and who are merely sensual are here meant, because the angel is called "the angel of the abyss," the "abyss" meaning the hell where such are (See above, n. <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>), also because this is said of the "locusts," which signify men who have become merely sensual through infernal falsities (See above, n. <a href="../ae/543.htm">543</a>). "To have this angel as a king over them" signifies to receive influx from hell, because all evils and all falsities therefrom are from hell, and because all who are in evils and in falsities therefrom are ruled and led by the hells, therefore hell is to such as a king who rules over them, and to whom they yield obedience; and because this, while they are living in the world, is effected by influx, and efflux from hell is what leads; thence "to have a king over them" signifies to receive influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 562 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>562. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_9_11" target=_top>11</a>.] "Et habebant super se regem, angelum abyssi." - Quod significet quod influxum reciperent ab inferno, ubi illi qui in falsis mali sunt, et mere sensuales, constat ex significatione "regis", quod sit verum ex bono, et in opposito sensu, ut hic, falsum ex malo (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_31" target=_top>31</a>); et ex significatione "angeli abyssi", quod sit infernum ubi falsa mali sunt; per "angelum" enim non intelligitur unus angelus, sed significatur infernum ubi tales sunt; quod per "angelum" in Verbo intelligantur integrae societates angelicae quae in simili bono sunt, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90" target=_top>90</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_302" target=_top>302</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_307" target=_top>307</a>); inde etiam per "angelum" in opposito sensu significantur societates infernales quae in simili malo: quod sint inferna ubi sunt illi qui in falsis mali sunt, et qui sunt mere sensuales, est quia dicitur "angelus abyssi", et per "abyssum" significatur infernum ubi sunt illi (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_583" target=_top>583</a>), et quia hoc dicitur de "locustis", per quas significantur homines qui facti mere sensuales per falsa infernalia (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_562/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_543" target=_top>543</a>). <p>Quod "habere supra se regem" illum significet et influxum recipere inde, est quia omnia mala et inde falsa ab inferno sunt; et quia omnes qui in malis et inde falsis sunt, ex infernis reguntur et ducuntur; quapropter infernum est illis sicut rex, qui dominatur super illos, et cui obedientiam praestant: hoc quia fit ex influxu, quando in mundo vivunt, et effluxus inde ducit, inde per "habere super se regem" significatur influxum recipere. </p>
