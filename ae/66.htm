<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 66</h4><p>66. (Verse 14) And his head and his hairs were white. That this signifies the Divine in primaries and in ultimates, is evident from the signification of the head when mentioned in reference to the Lord, of whom these things are said, as denoting the Divine in primaries, concerning which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of hairs, as denoting the Divine in ultimates, of which also we shall speak presently; and from the signification of white, as denoting what is pure. (That white (album) and white (candidum) denote what is pure, may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3301.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5319.htm">5319</a>.) The reason why the head, when mentioned in reference to the Lord, denotes the Divine in primaries, is, that the head is the highest part of man, and therein are those primary things which give rise to all things that take place in the body. For in the head are the understanding and the will, from which, as from their beginnings, all the other things flow that relate to man's remoter things, as speech, and all actions. But the reason why hairs, when mentioned in reference to the Lord, denote the Divine in ultimates is, that hairs are ultimates, for they grow from the ultimate parts of man, and the primaries terminate in them; therefore, when the head and hairs are mentioned, primaries and ultimates are meant.</p><p>[2] He who knows that the head signifies primaries, and the hairs ultimates, even in spiritual things, and that primaries and ultimates signify all things (as was shown above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>); also the strength of Samson was in his hairs, and when they were shaved off he became weak, and when they grew again his strength returned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_16_13.htm">Judges 16:13</a> to the end). Again, forty-two boys were torn in pieces by bears, because they mocked Elisha, calling him bald-head (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_24.htm">24</a>). So too Elias was clothed with a garment of hair (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_1_8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>) and John the Baptist with camel's hair (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_6.htm">Mark 1:6</a>). Moreover what is signified by the head, hairs, beard and baldness, may be seen where they are mentioned in the Word.</p><p>[3] The reason why a Nazarite was not allowed to shave his hair, because, as is stated, it was the Nazariteship of God upon his head, and that when the days were accomplished, he had to shave it off, and consecrate it, was, that a Nazarite represented the Lord in primaries and in ultimates, and His Divine in ultimates was His Human, which He made Divine even to the flesh and bones, which are the ultimates. That He made the Human Divine even to the flesh and bones, is clear from the fact that He left nothing in the sepulchre, and that He said to His disciples that He had flesh and bones, which a spirit has not (<a href="../ae/41.htm">41</a>; especially from the things which are adduced in Arcana Coelestia, to the effect that interiors successively flow into exteriors, even to the outermost or ultimate, and that therein also they exist and subsist, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/634.htm">Arcana Coelestia 634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6239.htm">6239</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6465.htm">6465</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9215.htm">9215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9216.htm">9216</a>; that they not only flow in successively, but also form what is simultaneous in the ultimate; concerning which order see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6451.htm">6451</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8603.htm">8603</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10099.htm">10099</a>; that therefore all interior things are held together in connection, from the primary by means of the ultimate, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9828.htm">9828</a>; and in the work, <a href="../hh/297.htm">Heaven and Hell 297</a>; that hence the ultimate is more holy than the interiors, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9824.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9824</a>; that hence in the ultimates there is strength and power, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9836.htm">9836</a>.) It was for these reasons that the Nazariteship was instituted. The reason why the Nazarite should ultimately consecrate his hair by putting it into the fire of the altar, was, because the Holy Divine was thereby represented, and the fire of the altar signified that Holy (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/934.htm">934</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>).</p><p>[4] From these considerations it is also evident why the strength of Samson was in his hair (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2762.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2762</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5247.htm">5247</a>.)</p><p>[5] From these considerations it is also clear why the garment of Elias was hairy, and that of John was made of camel's hair; for John the Baptist, as well as Elias, represented the Lord as to the Word, therefore he was also called Elias (as may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_20.htm">7:20</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Upon all heads shall be baldness, every beard shaven" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_2.htm">15:2</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Truth hath perished, and is cut off from their mouth; cut off thine hair and cast it away" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_28.htm">7:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_29.htm">29</a>).<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>"Take a razor, and pass it upon the head and beard" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_5_1.htm">5:1</a>).<p>Again:<p>"On every face shall be shame, and upon all heads baldness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_18.htm">7:18</a>).<p>Again:<p>"Every head was made bald" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_18.htm">29:18</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>"I will bring baldness upon every head" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_10.htm">8:10</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"God shall bruise the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of him that goeth on in his guilt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a>).<p>In these passages, and in others, by cutting off the hair of the head, shaving the beard, and inducing baldness, is signified to deprive of all good and truth, because he who is deprived of the ultimates is also deprived of things prior, for prior things exist and subsist in ultimates, as said above. In the world of spirits also, there are seen those who are bald; and I have been informed that they are those who were abusers of the Word and had applied the sense of the letter, which is Divine truth in the ultimates, to wicked purposes, and consequently were deprived of all truth; they are also the most wicked, and many of them are from the Babylonish nation; but, on the contrary, the angels are seen with becoming hair. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 66</h4><p>66. Verse 14. And His head and hairs white, signifies the Divine in firsts and in ultimates. This is evident from the signification of "head," when it refers to the Lord, of whom these things are said, as being the Divine in firsts (of which presently); and from the signification of "hairs," as being the Divine in ultimates (of which also presently); and from the signification of "white," as being what is pure. (That "white" [album] and "bright white" [candidum] mean what is pure, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3301.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3301</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5319.htm">5319</a>.) "Head," in reference to the Lord, is the Divine in firsts, because the head is the highest part of man, and in it are his firsts, which are called the beginnings, from which are derived all things that have place in the body; for in the head are the understanding and the will, from which, as from their firsts or beginnings, flow the remaining things that relate to man's outer life, such as speech and all actions. But "hairs," in reference to the Lord, mean the Divine in ultimates, because hairs are ultimate things, for they grow out of the outmost parts of man, and first things terminate in them; when, therefore, "head" and "hairs" are mentioned firsts and ultimates are meant.</p><p>[2] Anyone who knows that in spiritual things also "head" signifies first things and "hairs" ultimates, and that first things and ultimates signify all things (as shown in n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>);<p>also that:<p>The strength of Samson was in his locks, and when they were shaven off he became weak, and when they grew again he came into his strength (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_16_13.htm">Judges 16:13-31</a> tothe end);<p>also that:<p>Forty-two children were torn in pieces by bears because they mocked Elisha, calling him bald-head (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2 Kings 2:23-24</a>);<p>as also that:<p>Elijah was clothed with a garment of hair (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_1_8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>);<p>And John the Baptist with camel's hair (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_6.htm">Mark 1:6</a>);<p>furthermore, what "head," "hairs," "beard," and "baldness" signify wherever they are mentioned in the Word.</p><p>[3] That a Nazarite should not shave his hair, because this, as is said, was the Nazariteship of God upon his head; and that when the days were accomplished he should shave it off and consecrate it, was for the reason that the Nazarite represented the Lord in firsts and in ultimates, and His Divine in ultimates was His Human, which He made Divine even to the flesh and bones, which are ultimates. That He made it Divine even to the flesh and bones is evident from the fact that He left nothing in the sepulcher, and that:<p>He said to the disciples that He had flesh and bones, which a spirit hath not (<a href="../ae/41.htm">41</a>; especially from what was cited from the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that interior things flow in successively into exterior things, even into what is extreme or outmost, and there have existence and subsistence, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/634.htm">634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6239.htm">6239</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6465.htm">6465</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9215.htm">9215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9216.htm">9216</a>; that they not only flow in successively, but also form what is simultaneous in the ultimate, in what order see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6451.htm">6451</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8603.htm">8603</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10099.htm">10099</a>; that therefore all interior things are held together in connection from the first by means of the ultimate, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9828.htm">9828</a>, and in the work on <a href="../hh/297.htm">Heaven and Hell 297</a>; that from this the ultimate is more holy than the interiors, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9824.htm">9824</a>; and therefore in ultimates there is strength and power, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9836.htm">9836</a>). These then are the reasons why the Nazariteship was instituted. The Nazarite was finally to consecrate his hair by putting it into the fire of the altar, because it represented the Divine holiness, and the "fire of the altar" signified that holiness (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/934.htm">934</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>).</p><p>[4] From this it can be seen, moreover, why the strength of Samson was in his hair (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2762.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2762</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5247.htm">5247</a>.) From this it is clear also why Elijah had a hairy garment and John one of camel's hair; for John the Baptist, like Elijah, represented the Lord in respect to the Word; for this reason also he was called Elijah (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9372.htm">9372</a>).</p><p>[5] When these things are understood, it can be known what is signified in the Word by "head," "hairs," "beard," and "baldness," as in Isaiah:<p>In that time shall the Lord shave by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hairs of the feet, He shall also consume the beard (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>).<p>In the same prophet:<p>On all heads baldness, every beard cut off (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. Cut off thine hair and cast it away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28-29</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>Take a razor and pass it over the head and beard (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_5_1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a>).<p>Shame shall be upon every face, and baldness upon all heads (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_18.htm">Ezekiel 7:18</a>).<p>Every head was made bald (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>I will bring up baldness upon every head (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>).<p>In David:<p>God shall bruise the head of His enemies, the hairy scalp of him that goeth on in his guilt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_21.htm">Psalms 68:21</a>).<p>In these passages and in others, by "cutting off the hair of the head," "shaving the beard," and inducing baldness, is signified to deprive of all truth and good; since he that is deprived of ultimates is also deprived of things prior, for prior things have existence and subsistence in ultimates, as was said above. Moreover, in the world of spirits there are seen some that are bald, and I have been told that they are such as have abused the Word, and have applied the sense of the letter, which is Divine truth in ultimates, to wicked purposes, and therefore have been deprived of all truth. These are most malignant. Many of them are of the Babylonish body. Angels, on the contrary, appear with becoming hair. </p>

Quod ultimo consecraret crinem suum, mittendo illum in ignem altaris, erat quia sanctum Divinum repraesentabat, et "ignis altaris" significabat id sanctum (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_934" target=_top>934</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6314" target=_top>6314</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6832" target=_top>6832</a>).<p>[4] Ex his quoque constare potest cur Simsoni erat robur in crinibus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_judges_16_13" target=_top>Judic. 16:13</a>, ad fin. ) nam dicitur quod Naziraeus fuerit ab utero matris (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_judges_13_7" target=_top>Judicum 13:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_judges_16_17" target=_top>16:17</a>).<p>Inde quoque erat,<p>Quod non liceret summo sacerdoti ac filiis ejus, nec Levitis, radere caput, ac inducere sibi calvitium (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_10_6" target=_top>Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_21_5" target=_top>21:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_21_10" target=_top>10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_44_20" target=_top>Ezechiel 44:20</a>);<p>tum quod<p>Abscindere barbam (quae etiam simile significabat) apud populum Israeliticum esset ignominiosum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_10_4" target=_top>2 Samuelis 10:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_10_5" target=_top>5</a>).<p>Quod quadraginta duo pueri discerpti luerint ab ursis, quia illuserunt Elisaeo, vocantes illum calvum, erat causa, quia Elias et Elisaeus repraesentabant Dominum quoad Verbum, quod est Divinum Verum, cui sanctitas et robur est in ultimis ex primis, ut mox supra dictum est. Quia sic "calvitium" significabat deprivationem eorum, ideo hoc factum est. "Ursi" etiam significant verum in ultimis. (Quod Etias et Eli, aeus repraesentaverint Dominum quoad Yerbum, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2762" target=_top>2762</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5247" target=_top>5247</a>.) Ex his quoque patet, cur Eliae fuit "vestis pilosa", ac Johanni "ex pilis camelorum"; Johannes enim Baptista similiter ac Elias repraesentabat Dominum quoad Verbum, quapropter etiam dictus est Elias (videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_7643" target=_top>7643</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9372" target=_top>9372</a>).<p> <p>[5] Ex his intellectis sciri potest quid significatur per "caput", "capillos", "barbam", et "calvitium" in Verbo: <p>- Ut apud Esaiam,<p>"Tempore illo detondebit Dominus... per regem Aschuris caput, et pilos pedum, etiam barbam consumet" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_7_20" target=_top>7:20</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"In omnibus rapitibus calvitium, omnis barba rasa" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_15_2" target=_top>15:2</a>);<p>apud Jeremiam,<p>"Periit veritas, et excisa est ex ore illorum; tonde crinem, et abjice" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_7_28" target=_top>7:28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_7_29" target=_top>29</a>);<p>apud Ezechielem,<p>Accipe novaculam et transmitte super caput et barbam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_5_1" target=_top>5:1</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"In omni facie erit pudor, et in omnibus capitibus calvitium" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_7_18" target=_top>7:18</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Omne caput decalvatum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_29_18" target=_top>29:18</a>);<p>Apud Amos,<p>"Ascendere faciam... super omne caput calvitium" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_8_10" target=_top>8:10</a>);<p>apud Davidem,<p>"Deus contundet caput hostium, Verticem capillorum, ambulantium in reatibus" (Psalms 68:22 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_21" target=_top>21</a>]).<p>In his locis et aliis per "tondere caput", "abradere barbam", et "inducere calvitium", significatur deprivare omni vero et bono, quoniam qui deprivatur ultimis, etiam deprivatur prioribus, existunt enim et subsistunt priora in ultimis, ut supra est dictum. In mundo spirituum etiam apparent qui calvi sunt; et instructus sum quod sint qui abusi sunt Verbo, et sensum litterae, qui est Divinum Verum ibi in ultimis, applicuerunt ad nefanda, et inde deprivati sunt omni vero, sunt etiam malitiosissimi; plures ex illis sunt ex Babylonica gente: vicissim autem angeli apparent in decentibus comis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
