<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 355</h4><p>355. (Verse 2) And I saw, and behold a white horse. That this signifies the understanding of truth from the Word, is clear from the signification of a horse as denoting the Intellectual; and from the signification of white, which is said of truth. (That a horse signifies the Intellectual is evident from what is adduced and shown in the small work concerning the White Horse; and that white is said of truth, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>.) It is said that a white horse was seen when the Lamb opened the first seal, and a red horse when He opened the second, a black horse when He opened the third, and a pale horse when He opened the fourth; and because a horse signifies the Intellectual, specifically as to the Word, it may hence appear that the understanding of truth from the Word, and its quality with the men of the church, are here described by horses. Whether it is said that it is described, or those who are therein, amounts to the same thing; for men, spirits, and angels, are the subjects concerned. Hence it can be known that in this chapter, and in those immediately following, in the internal or spiritual sense, the Word is described as to the understanding. This is also evident from the ninth verse of this chapter, where, after those four horses were seen, and then the fifth seal was opened, it is said,<p>"I saw the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God";<p>and also from the nineteenth chapter of this book, where it is said:<p>The name of him that sat upon the white horse is called the Word of God (verse 13).<p>That by a horse the Intellectual is signified, and the understanding of truth from the Word by a white horse, may be seen shown in the small work above cited concerning the White Horse; but in it because only a few passages were adduced from the Word, to confirm that the horse signifies the Intellectual, I desire here to adduce further passages in order that there may be a full confirmation.</p><p>[2] In Ezekiel:<p>"Gather yourselves from all around to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you. Ye shall be filled at my table with horse and chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war. So will I give my glory among the nations" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_21.htm">21</a>).<p>The calling together of all to the Lord's kingdom is here treated of, and specifically the establishment of the church with the Gentiles; for the spiritual captivity in which the nations were, is treated of, and their liberation from it. By the sacrifice which should be sacrificed, is signified all worship by which the Lord is worshipped. By being filled at my table, is signified with all spiritual food, which being the understanding of truth from the Word and from doctrine thence, it is said, with horse and chariot; horse signifying the understanding of truth from the Word, and chariot signifying doctrine thence. And it is also said, "with the mighty man, and with every man of war"; and by a mighty man is signified truth from good, which destroys evil, and by a man of war is signified truth from good, which destroys falsity. Unless such things were signified, what purpose would be served that they should be filled with horse and chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war?</p><p>[3] Also in the Apocalypse:<p>"Gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_17.htm">19:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_18.htm">18</a>).<p>In the preceding passages the Word and its spiritual sense are there treated of; here, they are now invited to learn truths, and to perceive goods. And by the supper of the great God is signified instruction in truths, and thence the perception of good from the Lord; and by the flesh of kings, of captains, of mighty men, of horses, and of them that sit on them, are signified truths of every kind, which are from good; flesh signifies good; kings signify Divine truths in general; captains, the same specifically; mighty men, natural truths; horses, intellectual truths; and they that sit on them, spiritual truths. That the flesh of kings, of captains, of mighty men, of horses, and of them that sit on them, is not meant here is evident to every one.</p><p>[4] In Habakkuk:<p>"Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou ridest upon thy horses? Thy chariots [are] salvation. Thou hast trodden the sea with thy horses, the mud of many waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">15</a>).<p>Who does not see that by horses here are not meant horses; for it is said of Jehovah, that He rideth upon His horses, and that He treadeth the sea with His horses, and that His chariots are salvation? But this is said, because by riding upon horses is signified that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is in the understanding of His Word in its spiritual sense; and because thence is the doctrine of truth, which teaches the way of salvation, it is added, Thy chariots are salvation, chariots signifying doctrine; and by treading the sea with horses, is signified that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is in the understanding of His Word in its natural sense; for the sea there signifies it, and in general all things of the natural man, and for the natural man; and because Divine truths are there in their ultimate, it is therefore added, the mud of many waters, mud signifying the ultimate from which and in which [are truths], and waters signifying truths.</p><p>[5] In Zechariah:<p>"I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the bow of war shall be cut off; on the contrary he shall speak peace to the nations" (<a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>); peace signifies that good, and thence all things of the church. (That Ephraim signifies the church as to the understanding of truth, may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6237.htm">6237</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6267.htm">6267</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6296.htm">6296</a>; and that Jerusalem signifies the church as to doctrine, in the <a href="../njhd/6.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 6</a>; and above, n. <a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>.)</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>"And in that day, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and the horseman with madness; and I will open mine eye upon the house of Judah, but every horse of the people will I smite with blindness" (<a href="../ae/119.htm">119</a>, <a href="../ae/211.htm">211</a>); therefore it is said, "I will open mine eye upon it," by which is signified to enlighten them that they may see truths.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>"In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness to Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">14:20</a>).<p>Here also the Lord's advent is treated of, and the invitation of all to the church; and by the bells of the horses are signified scientifics and knowledges, and thence preachings which are from the understanding of truth. And because all understanding of truth is from the Lord, and hence the knowledges and the preachings themselves, therefore it is said, "There shall be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness to Jehovah." Because bells signify such things, therefore also there were bells of gold upon the borders of Aaron's robe around about (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_33.htm">Exodus 28:33-35</a>).</p><p>[8] In Moses:<p>"Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an asp upon the path, biting the heels of the horse, and the rider of it shall fall backwards; I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1710.htm">1710</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6396.htm">6396</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10335.htm">10335</a>; that by a serpent is signified the Sensual, which is the ultimate of the understanding, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6398.htm">6398</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6949.htm">6949</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8624.htm">8624</a>, end, 10313, and above, n. <a href="../ae/70.htm">70</a>; that by way is signified truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/627.htm">627</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2333.htm">2333</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10422.htm">10422</a>, and above, n. <a href="../ae/97.htm">97</a>; and that by the heel is signified the ultimate Natural, or the Natural Corporeal, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/259.htm">259</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4938.htm">4938</a>, and following numbers. What the Sensual is, and the quality of sensual men in both senses, may be seen in the <a href="../njhd/50.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 50</a>.)</p><p>[9] In Zechariah:<p>"I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, when behold, four chariots going out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. To the first chariot were red horses; to the second chariot black horses; to the third chariot white horses; and to the fourth chariot grisled horses, strong. The angel said, These are the four winds of heaven, going forth from standing near the Lord of the whole earth. The black horses which are therein going forth into the land of the north; and the white went forth after them; and the grisled went forth into the land of the south. And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might wander on the earth. And he said, Behold, these that go forth to the land of the north, have caused my spirit to rest in the land of the north. And they that are afar shall come and shall build in the temple of Jehovah" (<a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>; and that to go forth, signifies to proceed, in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5337.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5337</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7124.htm">7124</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9303.htm">9303</a>.) By them that are afar, who shall build in the temple of Jehovah, are signified those who previously were remote from the truths and goods of the church, who shall come into the church. (That these are signified by them that are afar, may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8918.htm">8918</a>; and that by the temple of Jehovah is signified the church, n. 3720); moreover, that by the north is signified an obscure [idea] of truth, and that by the south, a clear [idea] of truth, thus also those who are in an obscure and in a clear [idea] of truth, may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/148.htm">Heaven and Hell 148-151</a>.)<p>What is signified by red and black, in both senses, will be seen in the explanations at verses 4 and 5 of this chapter, and what by white may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>). By the mountains of brass, from between which the chariots and horses went forth, is signified the good of love in the natural man; this is said, because the nations who are here treated of, before they were enlightened, were not in spiritual good, but in natural good. (That by a mountain is signified the good of love, may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/795.htm">795</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4210.htm">4210</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8327.htm">8327</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8758.htm">8758</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">10438</a>; and by brass natural good, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/70.htm">70</a>.)</p><p>[10] In Job:<p>"God hath made her forget wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_39_17.htm">39:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_39_18.htm">18</a>).<p>These things are said of a bird, by which is signified intelligence from the proprium, which, strictly, is no intelligence; for man from himself sees nothing but falsities, and not truths; and intelligence is from truths, and not from falsities. Therefore it is said concerning her, "God hath made her to forget wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding," and that when she lifteth up herself on high, "she scorneth the horse and his rider," that is, the understanding of truth, and also the intelligent [man].</p><p>[11] In David:<p>"The strong in heart have become a prey, they have slept their sleep. Before thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and the horse have fallen asleep" (<a href="../ae/187.htm">187</a>).</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>"Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, traded with the soul of man and with vessels of brass. They of Bethogarma traded with horses, horsemen, and mules" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5741.htm">5741</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9212.htm">9212</a>.) Every one can see that by the tradings of Tyre enumerated in this chapter and elsewhere, are not meant tradings in such things, as vessels of brass, horses, and mules, and many others; but that spiritual tradings are meant, which are effected by the knowledges (cognitions) of truth and good. For the Word is Divine, and treats of Divine, and not of earthly things; therefore it contains spiritual things that pertain to heaven and the church, expressed in the ultimate sense, which is the sense of the letter, by the natural things that correspond to them. (That to trade and to follow merchandise, signifies, in the Word, to procure and communicate knowledges of truth and good, may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2967.htm">2967</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4453.htm">4453</a>; and that to buy and sell signifies the same, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2967.htm">2967</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4397.htm">4397</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4453.htm">4453</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5371.htm">5371</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5374.htm">5374</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5426.htm">5426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5886.htm">5886</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6143.htm">6143</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7999.htm">7999</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9039.htm">9039</a>.)</p><p>[13] In Isaiah:<p>"Who led them through the deeps, as a horse in the wilderness they stumbled not. As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah led him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_13.htm">63:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_14.htm">14</a>).<p>In this chapter the Lord, His combats with the hells, and His subjugation of them, are treated of; but here of those who are in love and faith towards Him. They are compared to a horse in the wilderness, and to a beast in the valley, because by a horse is signified the understanding of truth, and by a beast the affection of good; for all comparisons in the Word are from correspondences.</p><p>[14] In the Apocalypse:<p>"I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon it was called the Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">19:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_14.htm">14</a>).<p>That by the white horse is signified the understanding of the Word, also by the white horses upon which those sat who followed, is manifest. For He that sat on the white horse was the Lord as to the Word; for it is said, and "He that sat upon it was called the Word of God"; and in verse 16, "He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords." The Lord is called the Word, because the Word signifies the Divine truth proceeding from Him. But these things in the Apocalypse may be seen more fully explained in the small work concerning the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_4.htm">4</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the Lord.<p>In the same:<p>"Sing unto God, praise his name; extol him that rideth upon the clouds" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a cloud, and cometh into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">19:1</a>).<p>In David:<p>"Sing praises unto the Lord, who rideth upon the heaven of the heaven of old" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_32.htm">Psalms 68:32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_33.htm">33</a>).<p>And again:<p>God "rode upon a cherub, he did fly, and was carried upon the wings of the wind" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>).<p>In Habakkuk:<p>"Thou didst ride, O Jehovah, upon thine horses, thy chariots are salvation. Thou hast trodden the sea with thy horses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">15</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Then shalt thou delight in Jehovah; and I will cause thee to ride in the high places of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_58_14.htm">58:14</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>"So Jehovah alone did lead him, and made him to ride upon the high places of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_13.htm">13</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>"I will make Ephraim to ride" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_10_11.htm">10:11</a>).<p>In these passages, by riding is signified to give intelligence and wisdom, because by a chariot is signified the doctrine of truth, and by horses the understanding of it.</p><p>[15] In Isaiah:<p>"Then shall they bring all your brethren out of all nations a gift unto Jehovah upon horses, and upon the chariot, and in covered waggons upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to Jerusalem the mountain of my holiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9372.htm">9372</a>.)</p><p>[16] That chariots and horses signify doctrine and the understanding thereof, is still further evident from the opposite sense, in which chariots and horses signify the doctrines of falsity, and false scientifics from the Intellectual perverted. For most things in the Word have an opposite sense, from which it may be seen what the same signify in the genuine sense. That chariots and horses in that sense signify such things, is evident from the following passages: In Ezekiel:<p>"Behold, I will bring against Tyrus, the king of Babylon from the north, with horse and with chariot, and with horsemen, he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field. By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee; by reason of the voice of the horsemen, and of the wheel, and of the chariot, thy walls shall be shaken. With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay the people by the sword" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_7.htm">26:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_11.htm">11</a>).<p>By Tyrus is signified the church as to the knowledges (cognitions) of truth; and by the king of Babylon, the destruction of truth by falsities and profanation; by the north from which he shall come, is signified, whence is every falsity, specifically, hell whence it arises; by chariot, horses, and horsemen, are signified the doctrinals of falsity and reasonings from them; by the daughters whom he shall slay in the field with the sword, are signified the affections of truth which shall be extinguished by falsities; for daughters denote the affections of truth, the field denotes the church where those [affections are]; the sword denotes the combat of falsity against truth; and to slay denotes to extinguish. Hence it is evident what is signified by "their dust shall cover thee by reason of the abundance of his horses," dust denoting the evil of falsity. By the walls which shall be shaken by reason of the voice of the horseman, of the wheel, and of the chariot, are signified protecting truths, which in general are, that there is a God, and that the Word is Divine, and that there is a life eternal. These walls or these truths are said to be shaken by reason of the voice of the horseman, of the wheel, and of the chariot, when they come into doubt through false doctrines, and through reasonings from them. By the hoofs of the horses with which he shall tread down all the streets, are signified the outermost things of the natural man, which are called sensual things, from which are all falsities; the streets which shall thereby be trodden down denote the truths of the doctrine of the church, which are altogether destroyed; by the people who shall fall by the sword, are signified all those who are in truths, and abstractedly all truths.</p><p>[17] In Jeremiah:<p>"O sword against the liars, that they may become foolish, O sword against the mighty, that they may be dismayed, O sword against her horses and against her chariots, O sword against her treasures, that they may be plundered; let there be drought upon her waters, that they may be dried up, because it is a land of graven images" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8869.htm">8869</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8941.htm">8941</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10406.htm">10406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10503.htm">10503</a>.)</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>"Behold, as a cloud he shall come up, and his chariots as a whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled. Wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thoughts of iniquity abide in the midst of thee? The whole land shall be a desolation. The whole city hath fled for the voice of the horseman and bowmen; they have entered the clouds, and gone up into the rocks; the whole city is deserted" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_13.htm">4:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">29</a>).<p>Here the vastation of the church by the falsities of evil is described; the falsities are signified by the cloud; and the lust of reasoning from falsities against truths, by the horses that are swifter than eagles; and the doctrinals of falsity are meant by the chariots that are as a whirlwind. That, consequently, everything of the church and everything of its doctrine shall perish, is signified by the whole land shall be a desolation, and the whole city shall flee for the voice of the horseman and bowmen; the land denotes the church, and a city its doctrine; the voice of the horseman and bowmen denotes reasoning from them and assault, and to flee denotes to perish. That afterwards absolute falsity, and the faith of falsity would reign, is signified by, "They have entered the clouds, and gone up into the rocks"; clouds denoting falsities, and rocks the faith thereof. That the devastation of the church and its doctrine was thus described, is evident; for it is said, "Woe unto us! for we are spoiled. How long shall thoughts of iniquity abide in the midst of thee? The whole land shall be a desolation, the whole city deserted."</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>"Behold a people coming from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth. Their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses" (<a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>). Their reasoning is signified by their voice roaring as the sea, and their riding upon horses.</p><p>[20] In Ezekiel:<p>"Thou shalt come from thy place out of the sides of the north; thou and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses. And thou shalt go up against my people Israel, as clouds to cover the land" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_38_15.htm">38:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_38_16.htm">16</a>).<p>These things are said concerning Gog, by whom is signified external worship without any internal. The sides of the north signify here, as above, what is removed from goods and truths, and thus whence the falsities of evil are; and because they thence reason and attack the truths of the church, and extinguish them, it is said, "All of them riding upon horses; and thou shalt go up against my people Israel, as clouds to cover the land." Riding upon horses denotes reasonings; going up against the people Israel, and covering the land, signify to attack the truths of the church, and to extinguish them; clouds denote the falsities of evil.</p><p>[21] In Daniel:<p>"At the time of the end the king of the south shall contend with" the king of the north, "therefore as a whirlwind the king of the north shall rush in against him, with chariot, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into, and shall overflow and penetrate the countries" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1977.htm">1977</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6385.htm">6385</a>; and that to overflow signifies immersion in falsities and evils, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/660.htm">660</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/705.htm">705</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/739.htm">739</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/756.htm">756</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/790.htm">790</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5725.htm">5725</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6853.htm">6853</a>.)</p><p>[22] In Jeremiah:<p>"By thee will I disperse the nations, and by thee will I destroy the kingdoms, and by thee will I disperse the horse and his rider, and by thee will I disperse the chariot, and him that is carried therein" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_20.htm">51:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_21.htm">21</a>).<p>And in Haggai:<p>"I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariot and those who ride in it; and the horses and their riders shall come down, [every] man by the sword of his brother" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/haggai_2_22.htm">2:22</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the destruction of falsity and evil; and not concerning the destruction of any nation and kingdom; for by nations are signified evils, and by kingdoms in like manner as by peoples, falsities. It is also prophetical, and not historical. Hence it is plain what is signified by the horse and the rider, and by the chariot and him that is carried in it; namely, that by the horse and the rider are signified the Intellectual perverted, and reasoning thence; and by the chariot and him that is carried therein, the doctrine of falsity, or heresy, and those who are therein.</p><p>[23] In Nahum:<p>"Woe to the city of bloods! the whole is filled with lying and rapine; the voice of the whip, and the voice of the rattling of the wheel, and the horse neighing and the chariot jumping, the horseman making to ascend, and the glittering of the sword, and the glittering of the spear, and the multitude of the slain, and the heap of carcases, because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot selling the nations by her whoredoms, and families by her witchcrafts" (<a href="../ae/329.htm">329</a>). Therefore it is also said, the whole is filled with lying and rapine; a lie denoting falsity, and rapine denoting violence offered thereby; and because wars signify spiritual combats of truth against falsity, and of falsity against truth, therefore everything pertaining to war, as a whip, a horse, a chariot, a sword, and a spear, signifies various things pertaining to that warfare; what, however, each specifically signifies need not be shown in this place, only what the horse, the horseman, and the chariot signify. The voice of the rattling of the wheel signifies reasonings from falsities and evils; the horse neighing, and the chariot jumping, signify the lust to destroy truths, the horse denoting the Intellectual perverted, and chariot the doctrine of falsity, from which [it arises]. To neigh and to jump denotes to be carried away by lust and the delight attached to it, and the horseman making to ascend, denotes assault; hence it is said, "The multitude of the slain, and the heap of carcases," those being called slain who perish from falsities, and carcases those who perish from evils, and hence also it is said, "Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, that selleth the nations by her whoredoms, and families by her witchcrafts." By whoredoms are signified falsifications of truth, by a harlot heresy, by selling the nations is signified to become estranged from goods, and by selling families by witchcraft is signified to become estranged from truths; nations denoting goods, families the truths thence, and witchcrafts the falsities of evil whereby [they are estranged].</p><p>[24] In Habakkuk:<p>"I stir up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadths of the land, whose horses are swifter than leopards, and sharper than the wolves of the evening, that their horsemen may spread themselves; whence their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. They shall come all for violence; they shall all scoff at kings, and the rulers shall be a derision unto them" (<a href="../hh/197.htm">Heaven and Hell 197</a>). Their lust and dexterity in perverting truths, and destroying them by reasonings from falsities altogether remote from truths, are signified by, "whose horses are swifter than leopards, and sharper than the wolves of the evening, that their horsemen may spread themselves; whence their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat." Lust is signified by their horses being swifter than leopards; and dexterity by the horses being sharper than the wolves of the evening; and both by their flying as an eagle. Because the lust and dexterity are to destroy truths, therefore it is said, they shall come all for violence; their mocking at truths and goods is signified by their scoffing at kings, and the rulers being a derision unto them; kings signifying truths, and lords and rulers signifying goods.</p><p>[25] In David:<p>"These in the chariot, and those in horses; but we will glory in the name of our God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_20_7.htm">Psalms 20:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_20_8.htm">8</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"A king is not saved by the multitude of an army; a horse is a vain thing for safety" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_33_16.htm">Psalms 33:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_33_17.htm">17</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jehovah "delighteth not in the strength of the horse; his pleasure is not in the thighs of a man" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_10.htm">Psalms 147:10</a>).<p>By glorying in the chariot and in horses, and by Jehovah not delighting in the strength of a horse, are signified all things from one's own intelligence, from which proceed absolute falsities; and by the thighs of a man are signified those things that are from his own will, from which proceed absolute evils.</p><p>[26] In Amos:<p>"He that holdeth the bow shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot deliver himself; nor shall he that rideth upon the horse deliver his soul. But the strong in his heart shall flee away naked in that day" (<a href="../ae/240.htm">240</a>).</p><p>[27] In Isaiah:<p>"The Lord Jehovih, the Holy One of Israel saith, In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength; and ye would not. But ye said, No; but upon the horse we will flee; and therefore ye shall flee; and we will ride upon the swift, and therefore shall they that pursue you be made swift" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_15.htm">30:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Trust in the Lord and trust in self are here treated of; trust in the Lord in these words, the Lord Jehovih, the Holy One of Israel, said, "In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength"; trust in self in these words, "But ye said, No; but upon the horse we will flee, and we will ride upon the swift." By fleeing upon the horse and riding upon the swift, are signified to covet and to love the things of their own understanding, and of the thought and reasoning thence. That falsities will then break in upon, and take possession of them, is signified by, therefore ye shall flee, and therefore shall they that pursue you be made swift; swiftness and haste signifying what is done from lust or from love.</p><p>[28] In Zechariah:<p>Jehovah shall set Judah "as the horse of his glory in war; out of him the corner, out of him the nail, and out of him the bow of war. And they shall be as mighty men treading down the mire of the streets; and they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and them that ride upon horses shall they make ashamed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">10:3-5</a>).<p>By the house of Judah is signified the Lord's celestial kingdom, or the heaven and church which are in love to the Lord. Concerning this it is said that it shall be as the horse of glory in war, by which is signified the understanding of Divine truth combating against evils and falsities, which it shall destroy. By horse is signified the understanding; by glory, the Divine truth; and by war, the combat against falsities and evils, and their destruction. By the corner, the nail, and the bow of war, which [shall come] out of Judah, are signified truths; by the corner, truth protecting; by the nail, truth strengthening; and by the bow of war, truth combating from doctrine. By their being as mighty men treading down the mire of the streets, is signified the power of dissipating and destroying falsities, the mire of the streets signifying falsities; by their making ashamed them that ride upon horses, is signified the annihilation of reasonings, argumentations, and confirmations that are from man's own understanding; that this shall be accomplished by the Lord, and not by them, is meant by, "they shall fight because Jehovah is with them."</p><p>[29] In Hosea:<p>"Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon the horse; we will say no more to the work of our hands, Our God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_3.htm">14:3</a>).<p>Intelligence from the proprium is also here treated of, and that it will not save. By Asshur is signified the Rational, in this case, what is from the proprium; by riding upon the horse is signified the reasoning of the understanding from the proprium; and by the work of the hands is signified the proprium itself.</p><p>[30] In Ezekiel:<p>"Aholah played the harlot, and she doted on her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbours, clothed in purple, horsemen riding upon horses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_5.htm">23:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_23.htm">23</a>).<p>Aholah, which here is Samaria, signifies the church where truths are falsified; her whoredoms, treated of in this chapter, signify falsifications. The Assyrians signify reasonings by which [truths are falsified]; and because by riding upon horses is signified to reason from falsities that are from one's own intelligence, therefore it is said, she doted on the Assyrians, horsemen riding upon horses. By the purple in which they were clothed, is signified falsity appearing like truth, which is effected principally by the application of the sense of the letter of the Word to principles of falsity.</p><p>[31] In Jeremiah:<p>"The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighings of his strong ones; and they have come, and have devoured the land, and its fulness; and them that dwell therein" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_16.htm">8:16</a>).<p>What is meant by Dan has been stated above in the present article, namely, truth in its ultimate; this is the truth in the church which is contained in the sense of the letter of the Word. Those who remain in this alone, and do not read it from the doctrine of genuine truth, which should direct and enlighten, may be carried away into all kinds of errors; those who are carried away into errors or falsities are meant here by Dan; the confirmation of falsities thence, by the snorting of his horses; and the falsifications of truth, by the sound of the neighings of his strong ones. They are called strong, from their confidence, from the sense of the letter of the Word, that falsity is truth. That hence the church is vastated as to its truths and goods, is signified by, "the whole land trembled"; and "they have come, and have devoured the land and its fulness, and them that dwell therein"; the land denoting the church, its fulness denoting truths, and they that dwell therein denoting goods.</p><p>[32] In Isaiah:<p>"He hath lifted up a sign to the nations from afar, and hath hissed unto him from the end of the earth, and, behold! the swift shall come quickly, whose arrows are sharp, and all his bows bent; the hoofs of his horses are accounted as the rock, and his wheels as the whirlwind" (<a href="../njhd/50.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 50</a>); from these, separated from the spiritual man, stream forth all the evils and falsities in the church and in its doctrine. The evils thence, are signified by the nations which shall come from far; and the falsities, by him who comes from the end of the earth; afar off, and the end of the earth, signifying those things that are remote from the truths and goods of the church. By the arrows which are sharp, and by the bows which are bent, are signified falsities of doctrine prepared to destroy truths; and by the hoofs of the horses which are accounted as the rock, and by his wheels which are as the whirlwind, are signified the ultimates of truth, such as they are in the sense of the letter of the Word, and arguments and confirmations of falsity thereby. The hoofs of the horses denote the ultimates of the understanding - here of the understanding perverted, because separated from the understanding of the spiritual man - which, because from the sense of the letter of the Word, it is said, are accounted as the rock; and the wheels denote argumentations and confirmations thereby, which, because they appear strong, are said to be like a whirlwind.</p><p>[33] In the book of Judges:<p>"My heart is toward the legislators of Israel. Meditate, ye that ride on white asses, and sit upon Middim, and who walk upon the way. The stars from their courses fought against Sisera. Then were the feet of his horses bruised, the prancing of his strong ones pranced together" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_9.htm">5:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_22.htm">22</a>).<p>These words are contained in the song of Deborah and Barak; in which the subjects treated of are the combat of truth against falsity, and the victory of the former. By the legislators of Israel are signified the truths of the church; by riding upon white asses, and sitting upon Middim, are signified the perception of good, and the understanding of truth; white asses signify the Rational as to good, and Middim the Rational as to truth; and to walk upon the way, and to meditate, signify the life of truth; the stars from their courses fighting against Sisera, signify the knowledges of truth, and combat from them against the falsities of evil; the feet of the horses which were bruised, and the prancing of the horses which pranced together, signify that the falsities that are from the ultimate Natural, or Sensual, and the arguments thence, are destroyed.</p><p>[34] In Amos:<p>"Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plough with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of justice into wormwood" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_6_12.htm">6:12</a>).<p>Shall horses run upon the rock? signifies, is there any understanding of truth? shall one plough with oxen? signifies, is there any perception of good? That these things are signified is evident, for it follows, for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of justice into wormwood. To turn judgment into gall, signifies to turn truth into falsity; and to turn the fruit of Justice into wormwood, signifies [to turn] good into evil.</p><p>[35] In David:<p>"Thou hast laid oppression upon our loins. Thou hast caused a man to ride over our head; we went through the fire and the waters; but thou hast brought us out into broadness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_11.htm">Psalms 66:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_12.htm">12</a>).<p>Spiritual captivity, and deliverance thence, are thus described. Spiritual captivity takes place when the mind is shut up so as not to perceive good and understand truth; deliverance from it denotes, when the mind is opened. By the oppression upon the loins, is signified that there is no perception of the good of love, for the loins and thighs signify the good of love; by making a man to ride over our head, is signified, that there is no understanding of truth; by a man here is signified intelligence from self, which is no intelligence; and the same [is signified] by the head. Because these things are signified, therefore, it is said, we went through the fire and the waters; through the fire denoting through the evils from the love of self, and through the waters denoting through falsities; deliverance thence is meant by, "But thou hast brought us out into broadness," breadth signifying truth, as shown above.</p><p>[36] In Isaiah:<p>"Woe to them that go down into Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in the chariot, but do not look unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek Jehovah; for Egypt is man, and not God; and his horses flesh, and not spirit" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_1.htm">31:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_3.htm">3</a>).<p>By Egypt in the Word is signified the Scientific which is in the natural man, and hence also the natural man; and because the natural man, with the Scientific therein, has no understanding, but only thought from the memory, which is a species of imagination from the objects of sight and hearing, and because it is beneath the Spiritual, in which reside all the goods and truths of heaven and the church, hence by Egypt in most passages is signified a false Scientific; for when the spiritual man does not flow in, the scientifics of the natural man are turned into absolute falsities, and his thoughts into confirmations of falsity, and reasonings from them against truths. Hence it is evident what is signified by the horses of Egypt, and the chariots thereof, namely, that false scientifics [are signified] by horses, and doctrinals, whence proceed reasonings against truths, by chariots. Those, therefore, who are of such a quality, do not seek truth from any other source than from themselves, for the proprium of every one resides in the natural man, and not in the spiritual; wherefore instead of truths they seize upon falsities, and instead of goods evils; and the latter they call goods, and the former they call truths, and they trust in themselves, because in their own proprium. These things are signified by, "Woe to them that go down into Egypt; and stay on horses, and trust in the chariot, because it is great; and in horsemen because they are very strong." Horses here denote false scientifics; and chariots denote the doctrinals thence; and horsemen denote reasonings from them against truths; therefore it is also said, "Egypt is man, and not God; and his horses flesh, and not spirit"; by which is signified, that what is in them is merely natural, and not spiritual, nor, consequently, anything of life. Man signifies the natural man, and flesh the proprium thereof; God and spirit signify the Divine spiritual man, and hence life; and because they trust in themselves and not in the Lord, it is said, they do not look unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek Jehovah.</p><p>[37] From these considerations it may now be seen what is signified by the horses, the chariots, and the armies of Pharaoh, in Moses:<p>"I will get me honour upon Pharaoh and upon his army, and upon his horsemen. And the Egyptians pursued" the sons of Israel, "and the horses of Pharaoh went after them, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea. And Jehovah took off the wheels of their chariots, that they led them with difficulty. And when Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, together with the whole host of Pharaoh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_28.htm">28</a>).<p>And in the same:<p>"Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto Jehovah; In singing I will sing unto Jehovah, because in exalting he hath exalted himself; the horse and his rider hath he cast into the sea, and his chariots and his host" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_2.htm">2</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_1.htm">1</a>).<p>What is signified by the horses and chariots of Pharaoh or Egypt has been shown above. By the host thereof are signified all falsities in general and in particular; and by the sea are signified damnation and hell, where all are in the proprium, because in the natural man separate from the spiritual, and thence in evils and falsities of every kind.<p>The same is signified by the horses of Egypt, in these [words] in Moses:<p>"If ye shall say, I will set over me a king, in setting thou shalt set over thee a king whom Jehovah thy God shall choose; only he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor shall he bring back the people into Egypt, that he may multiply horses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-16</a>).<p>These things are said concerning a king, because the Lord is represented as to Divine truth by kings, and hence by kings are signified truths from good from the Lord (see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_4.htm">Jeremiah 46:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_17_15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_20.htm">23:20</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 355</h4><p>355. Verse 2 (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). And I saw, and behold a white horse, signifies the understanding of truth from the Word. This is evident from the signification of "horse," as being the intellect; and from the signification of "white," which is predicated of truth. (That the "horse" signifies the intellect can be seen from what is quoted and shown in the small work on The White Horse; and that "white" is predicated of truth, see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>). <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>).<p>That "a horse" signifies the intellect, and "a white horse" the understanding of truth from the Word, can be seen shown in the small work cited above, on The White Horse; but as only a few passages were there quoted from the Word, in proof that "horse" signifies the intellect, I will here quote more, that there may be full confirmation; these now follow.</p><p>[2] In Ezekiel:<p>Gather yourselves from the circuit to My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you. Ye shall be satisfied at My table with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war. So will I give My glory among the nations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_20.htm">20-21</a>).<p>This treats of the calling together of all to the Lord's kingdom, and especially of the establishment of the church with the Gentiles; for it describes the spiritual captivity in which the Gentiles were, and their liberation from it. "The sacrifice to be sacrificed" signifies all the worship by which the Lord is worshiped; "to be satiated at My table" signifies with all spiritual food; and as this food is the understanding of truth from the Word and from doctrine from the Word, it is said, "with horse and with chariot," "horse" signifying the understanding of truth from the Word, and "chariot" signifying the doctrine therefrom. It is also said, "with the mighty man, and with every man of war," "mighty man" signifying the truth from good that destroys evil, and "man of war" the truth from good that destroys falsity. Unless such things were signified, how could it be said that they should be satiated "with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war?"</p><p>[3] Likewise in Revelation:<p>Gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders of thousands, and the flesh of the strong ones, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>).<p>What precedes this treats of the Word and its spiritual sense; this now is an invitation to learn truths, and to perceive goods; and "the supper of the great God" signifies instruction in truths, and the consequent perception of good from the Lord; and "the flesh of kings," "of commanders of thousands," "of the strong ones," "of horses," and "of them that sit on them," signifies truths of every kind which are from good; "flesh" signifying good, "kings" Divine truths in general, "commanders of thousands" the same in particular, "strong ones" natural truths, "horses" intellectual truths, and "those that sit on them" spiritual truths. It must be clear to everyone that this does not mean the flesh of kings, of commanders of thousands, of strong ones, of horses, and of them that sit on them.</p><p>[4] In Habakkuk:<p>Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? was Thine anger against the rivers? was Thy fury against the sea? because Thou ridest upon Thy horses, Thy chariots are salvation, Thou hast trodden down the sea with Thy horses, the mire [or clay] of many waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">15</a>).<p>Who does not see that "horses" here do not mean horses? For it is said of Jehovah that "He rideth upon His horses," and that "He treadeth down the sea with His horses," and that "His chariots are salvation?" But this is said because "His riding upon horses" signifies that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is in the understanding of His Word in its spiritual sense; and since the doctrine of truth, which teaches the way of salvation, is from the Word, it is added, "Thy chariots are salvation," "chariots" signifying doctrine; also "to tread down the sea with horses" signifies that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is in the understanding of His Word in its natural sense; for "sea" here signifies that sense, and in general all things of the natural man and that are for the natural man; and because Divine truths there are in their ultimate, it is added, "the mire [or clay] of many waters," "mire" [or "clay"] signifying the ultimate from which and in which are truths, and "waters" signifying truths.</p><p>[5] In Zechariah:<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the bow of war shall be cut off; but He shall speak peace to the nations (<a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>), "peace" signifying that good, and thence all things of the church.

Because "bells" have this signification:<p>There were bells of gold upon the skirts of Aaron's robe round about (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_34.htm">Exodus 28:34-35</a>).</p><p>[8] In Moses:<p>Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an asp upon the path, biting the horse's heels, and its rider shall fall backwards: I wait for Thy salvation, O Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1710.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1710</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6396.htm">6396</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10335.htm">10335</a>; that "serpent" signifies the sensual, which is the ultimate of the understanding, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6398.htm">6398</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6949.htm">6949</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8624.htm">8624</a> end, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10313.htm">10313</a>, and above, n. <a href="../ae/70.htm">70</a>; that "way" signifies truths, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/627.htm">Arcana Coelestia 627</a>, 2333, 10422, and above, n. <a href="../ae/97.htm">97</a> [1-2]; and that "the heel" signifies the ultimate natural, or the corporeal natural, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/259.htm">259</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4938.htm">4938</a>, seq.

To the first chariot were red horses; to the second chariot black horses; to the third chariot white horses; and to the fourth chariot grisled horses, stout. The angel said, These are the four winds of heaven, going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth. The black horses which are therein go forth to the land of the north; and the white went forth after them; and the grisled went forth into the land of the south; and the stout ones went forth and sought to go that they might wander through the earth. And he said, See these that go forth to the land of the north, they have caused my spirit to rest in the land of the north. And they that are afar shall come and shall build in the temple of Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9642.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9642</a>, and <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>; and that "to go forth" signifies to proceed, Arcana Coelestia <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5337.htm">5337</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7124.htm">7124</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9303.htm">9303</a>.) "They that are afar, that shall build in the temple of Jehovah" signify those who were previously far away from the truths and goods of the church, who shall draw near to the church. (That such are signified by "those that are afar," see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4723.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4723</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8918.htm">8918</a>; and that the "temple of Jehovah" signifies the church, n. 3720; moreover, that "the north" signifies the obscurity of truth, and "the south" [auster sive meridies] the clearness of truth, thus also those that are in obscurity and in clearness of truth, see <a href="../hh/148.htm">Heaven and Hell 148-151</a>.) What is signified by "red" and by "black," in both senses, will be seen in the explanations at verses 4 and 5 of this chapter, and what by "white," see above n. <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>. "The mountains of copper, from between which the chariots and horses went forth," signify the good of love in the natural man; this is said because the nations here treated of, before they were illustrated, were not in spiritual good but in natural good. (That "mountain" signifies the good of love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4210.htm">4210</a>, 6435, 8327, 8758, 10438; and "copper" natural good, see above, n. <a href="../ae/70.htm">70</a>)</p><p>[10] In Job:<p>God hath made her forget wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her intelligence.

Everyone can see that "the tradings of Tyre," which are enumerated in this chapter and elsewhere, do not mean tradings with these things, such as vessels of brass, horses, and mules, and many others; but that spiritual tradings are meant, which are effected by means of the knowledges of truth and good; for the Word is Divine, and treats of Divine things, and not of earthly things; therefore it contains spiritual things which pertain to heaven and the church, expressed in the ultimate sense, which is the sense of the letter, by natural things which correspond to them. (That "to trade" and "to be a merchant" signifies in the Word to acquire and to communicate the knowledges of truth and good, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2967.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2967</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2967.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2967[1-9]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4453.htm">4453</a>; and that "to buy" and "to sell" signify something similar, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2967.htm">2967</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4397.htm">4397</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4453.htm">4453</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5371.htm">5371</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5374.htm">5374</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5426.htm">5426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5886.htm">5886</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6143.htm">6143</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7999.htm">7999</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9039.htm">9039</a>.)</p><p>[13] In Isaiah:<p>Who led them through the deeps, as a horse in the wilderness they stumbled not; as a beast goeth down into the valley the Spirit of Jehovah led him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_13.htm">Isaiah 63:13-14</a>).<p>This chapter treats of the Lord, and His combat with the hells, and His subjugation of them, but here of the salvation of those who are in love and faith towards Him. These are compared to "a horse in the wilderness," and to "a beast in the valley," because "horse" signifies the understanding of truth, and "beast" the affection of good; for all comparisons in the Word are from correspondences.</p><p>[14] In Revelation:<p>I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called the Word of God. And the armies that are in heaven followed Him upon white horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p>"A white horse" evidently signifies the understanding of the Word, likewise "the white horses" upon which those sat who followed; for "He that sat upon" the white horse was the Lord in relation to the Word; for it is said, "and He that sat upon him was called the Word of God;" and in verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_16.htm">6:16</a>, "He had upon His vesture and upon His thigh a name written, Lord of lords and King of kings." The Lord is called the Word, because the Word means Divine truth proceeding from Him. (But these things in Revelation may be seen more fully explained in the small work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3-4</a>).<p>These things are said of the Lord. In the same:<p>Sing unto God, sing psalms to His name; extol Him that rideth upon the clouds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a cloud, and cometh into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved before Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>In David:<p>Sing psalms unto the Lord, to Him who rideth upon the heaven of the heaven of old (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_32.htm">Psalms 68:32-33</a>).<p>God rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>).<p>In Habakkuk:<p>O Jehovah, Thou dost ride upon Thine horses, Thy chariots are salvation. Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">3:15</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Then shalt thou delight in Jehovah; and I will make thee ride in the high places of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_58_14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>Jehovah alone did lead him, and made him ride upon the high places of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12-13</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>I will make Ephraim to ride (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_10_11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>).<p>In these passages, "to ride" signifies to give intelligence and wisdom, because "chariot" signifies the doctrine of truth, and "horses" the understanding of it.</p><p>[15] In Isaiah:<p>Then shall they bring all your <sup>1</sup>brethren out of all nations an offering unto Jehovah upon horses and upon the chariot, and upon covered wagons, upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9372.htm">9372</a>.)</p><p>[16] That "chariots" and "horses" signify doctrine and the understanding of it, can be seen, moreover, from their contrary sense, in which "chariots" and "horses" signify the doctrines of falsity, and false knowledges [scientifica] from a perverted intellect; for most things in the Word have a contrary sense, from which it can be seen what the same signify in the genuine sense. That "chariots" and "horses" in that sense have such a signification can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>Behold, I will bring against Tyre the king of Babylon from the north, with horse and with chariot, and with horsemen. He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field. By reason of the abundance of His horses their dust shall cover thee; by reason of the voice of the horseman and of the wheel and of the chariot, thy walls shall quake. With the hoofs of his horses shall he trample all thy streets; he shall slay the people with the sword (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7-8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_10.htm">10-11</a>).<p>"Tyre" signifies the church in relation to the knowledges of truth; and "the king of Babylon" the destruction of truth by falsities and profanation; "the north from which he was to come" signifies the source of all falsity, in particular, hell, out of which falsity arises; "chariot," "horses," and "horsemen" signify the doctrine of falsity and reasonings therefrom; "the daughters whom they shall slay in the field with the sword" signify the affections of truth which falsities will destroy, for "daughters" are the affections of truth, "the field is the church where those affections are, "the sword" is the combat of falsity against truth, and "to slay" is to extinguish. This makes clear the signification of "by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee," "dust" meaning the evil of falsity; the "walls that shall quake by reason of the voice of the horseman, of the wheel, and of the chariot," signify protecting truths, which in general are, that there is a God, and that the Word is Divine, and that there is eternal life. These "walls," or these truths, are said "to quake by reason of the voice of the horseman, of the wheel, and of the chariot," when they come to be doubted through the falsities of doctrines and reasonings from them; "the hoofs of the horses with which he shall trample all the streets," signify the outermost things of the natural man, which are called sensual impressions [sensualia], from which are all falsities; the "streets that shall be trampled by them" are the truths of the doctrine of the church, which are wholly destroyed; the "people who shall fall by the sword" signify all who are in truths, and in an abstract sense all truths.</p><p>[17] In Jeremiah:<p>O sword, against the liars, that they may become foolish; O sword, against the mighty, that they may be dismayed; O sword, against her horses and against her chariots; O sword, against her treasures, that they may be despoiled; let there be drought upon her waters that they may be dried up: because it is a land of graven images (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8869.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8869</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8941.htm">8941</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10406.htm">10406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10503.htm">10503</a>)</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as the storm; his horses are swifter than eagles.

That then mere falsity and the faith of falsity would reign is signified by "they have entered the thick clouds, and have gone up into the rocks," "clouds" meaning falsities, and "rocks" the faith of falsities. The devastation of the church and of its doctrine is evidently here described, for it is said, "Woe unto us! for we are devastated. How long shall the thoughts of iniquity lodge in the midst of thee? The whole land shall be a waste. The whole city is forsaken.

For this is prophetical, not historical. This makes clear what "horse" and "rider," and "chariot and him that rideth in it" signify, namely, that "horse and rider" signify a perverted intellect and reasoning therefrom and "the chariot and him that rideth in it" the doctrine of falsity or heresy, and those who are in it.</p><p>[23] In Nahum:<p>Woe to the city of bloods! the whole is filled with lying and rapine; the voice of the whip, and the voice of the rattling of the wheel, and the horse neighing and the chariot leaping, the horseman making to ascend, and the flame of the sword, and the flash of the spear, and a multitude of the slain, and a heap of carcasses, because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, selling nations by her whoredoms, and families by her sorceries (<a href="../ae/329.htm">329</a>); therefore it is also said, "the whole is filled with lying and rapine," "lie" meaning falsity, and "rapine" violence offered by falsity; and as "wars" signify spiritual combats, which are the combats of truth against falsity and of falsity against truth, all things pertaining to war, as "whip," "horse," "chariot," "sword," and "spear," signify various things pertaining to spiritual warfare; but what each of these in particular signifies need not be explained here, only what "horse," "horseman," and "chariot" signify. "The voice of the rattling of the wheel" signifies reasonings from falsities and evils; "the horse neighing and the chariot leaping" signifies the lust of destroying truths, "horse" meaning the intellect perverted, and "chariot" the doctrine of falsity, which destroy; "to neigh" and "to leap" meaning to be moved to destroy by lust and delight, and "horseman making to ascend" meaning assault. It is therefore said, "a multitude of the slain, and a heap of carcasses;" those are called "slain" who perish from falsities, and "carcasses" who perish from evils; therefore it is also said, "because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, selling the nations by her whoredoms, and families by her sorceries;" "whoredoms" signify the falsifications of truth, "harlot" heresy, "to sell nations" signifies to become estranged from goods, and "to sell families by sorcery" to become estranged from truths, "nations" meaning goods, "families" truths therefrom, and "sorceries" the falsities of evil which estrange.</p><p>[24] In Habakkuk:<p>I rouse up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that marcheth into the breadths of the land; her horses are lighter than leopards, and more fierce than the wolves of the evening, so that her horsemen spread themselves; yea, her horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as an eagle that hasteth to eat. She shall come wholly for violence; she shall mock at kings, and rulers shall be a derision unto her (<a href="../hh/197.htm">Heaven and Hell 197</a>). Their lust for and dexterity in perverting truths and destroying them by reasonings from falsities altogether remote from truths are signified by, "her horses are lighter than leopards, and more fierce than the wolves of the evening, so that her horsemen spread themselves; yea, her horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as an eagle that hasteth to eat." Lust is signified by "her horses are lighter than leopards," and dexterity by "her horses are more fierce than the wolves of the evening," and both by "they fly as an eagle." Because the lust and dexterity are for destroying truths therefore it is said, "she shall come wholly for violence;" their scoffing at truths and goods is signified by "she shall mock at kings, and rulers shall be a derision unto her," "kings" signifying truths, and "lords" and "rulers" goods.</p><p>[25] In David:<p>Some in the chariot, and some in horses; but we will glory in the name of our God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_20_7.htm">Psalms 20:7</a>).<p>In the same:<p>A king is not saved by the multitude of an army; a horse is a lying thing for safety (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_33_16.htm">Psalms 33:16-17</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jehovah delighteth not in the might of a horse; His pleasure is not in the thighs of a man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_10.htm">Psalms 147:10</a>).<p>"To glory in the chariot and in horses," and "Jehovah delighteth not in the might of a horse," signify all things from self-intelligence, from which are nothing but falsities; and "the thighs of a man" signify those things that are from his own will, from which are nothing but evils.</p><p>[26] In Amos:<p>He that holdeth the bow shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot escape, nor shall he that rideth upon the horse cause his soul to escape, but he that is stout of heart shall flee naked in that day (<a href="../ae/240.htm">240</a>).</p><p>[27] In Isaiah:<p>The Lord Jehovih, the Holy One of Israel, saith, In quietness and in confidence shall be your might; but ye would not, and said, No, but upon a horse we will flee; therefore ye shall flee; and we will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be made swift (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_15.htm">Isaiah 30:15-16</a>).<p>This treats of confidence in the Lord and of confidence in self; confidence in the Lord in these words, "the Lord Jehovih, the Holy One of Israel, said, In quietness and in confidence shall be your might;" and confidence in self in these words, "and ye said, No, but upon a horse we will flee," and "we will ride upon the swift;" "to flee upon a horse," and "to ride upon the swift," signifying to covet and love those things that are of one's own understanding, and thought and reasoning therefrom. That falsities will then break in and take possession is signified by, "therefore ye shall flee," and "therefore shall they that pursue you be made swift," "swiftness" and "haste" signifying what is done from lust, or from love.</p><p>[28] In Zechariah:<p>Jehovah shall set Judah as the horse of His majesty in war; out of him shall be the corner, out of him the nail, and out of him the bow of war. And they shall be as mighty men treading down the mire of the streets; and they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and they shall make ashamed them that ride upon horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">Zechariah 10:3-5</a>).<p>"The house of Judah" signifies the Lord's celestial kingdom, that is, the heaven and church that are in love to the Lord; of this it is said that it shall be "as the horse of majesty in war," which signifies the understanding of Divine truth combating against evils and falsities, which it will destroy, "horse" signifying the understanding, "majesty" Divine truth, and "war" combat against falsities and evils and their destruction. "The corner," "the nail," and "the bow of war," that are "out of Judah," signify truths, "the corner" truth protecting, "the nail" truth strengthening, and the "bow of war" truth combating from doctrine; "they shall be as mighty men treading down the mire of the streets" signifies the power to disperse and destroy falsities, "mire of the streets" signifying falsities. "They shall make ashamed them that ride upon horses" signifies the annihilation of the reasonings, argumentations, and confirmations that are from man's own understanding; that this shall be accomplished by the Lord and not by them is meant by, "they shall fight because Jehovah is with them."</p><p>[29] In Hosea:<p>Asshur will not save us; we will not ride upon the horse; we will say no more to the work of our hands, Thou art our God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_3.htm">Hosea 14:3</a>).<p>This also treats of intelligence from self [ex proprio], that it will not save. "Asshur" signifies the rational, here as being from self [ex proprio]; "to ride upon the horse" signifies reasoning of the understanding from self [ex proprio]; and "work of the hands" signifies the selfhood [proprium] itself.</p><p>[30] In Ezekiel:<p>Oholah committed whoredom, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, clothed in blue, horsemen riding upon horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_23.htm">23</a>).<p>"Oholah," which here is Samaria, signifies a church in which truths are falsified; "her whoredoms," which are treated of in this chapter, signify falsifications; "the Assyrians" signify reasonings by which truths are falsified; and because "to ride upon horses" signifies to reason from falsities that are from self-intelligence, it is said, "she doted on the Assyrians, horsemen riding upon horses;" the "blue, in which they were clothed," signifies falsity appearing as truth, which appearance comes chiefly from applying the sense of the letter of the Word to principles of falsity.</p><p>[31] In Jeremiah:<p>The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighings of his stout ones the whole land quaked; and they came and devoured the land and its fullness; [the city] and those that dwell therein (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_8_16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>).<p>What is meant by "Dan" has been told above in this article, namely, truth in its ultimate; this is the truth in the church that is contained in the sense of the letter of the Word. Those who abide in this alone, and do not read the Word from the doctrine of genuine truth, which should guide and illustrate, may be carried away into all kinds of errors; those who are carried away into errors or falsities are meant here by "Dan;" the consequent confirmation of falsities is meant by "the snorting of his horses;" and the falsifications of truth are meant by "the sound of the neighings of his stout ones;" these are called "stout" from their confidence, because it is from the sense of the letter of the Word, that falsity is truth. That the church in respect to its truths and goods is thereby vastated, is signified by "the whole land quaked;" and "they came and devoured the land and its fullness, and those that dwell therein," "the land" meaning the church, "its fullness" truths, and "those that dwell therein" goods.</p><p>[32] In Isaiah:<p>He hath lifted up an ensign to the nations from far, and hath hissed to him from the end of the earth, and behold the swift one shall come in haste, whose arrows are sharp, and all his bows are bent; the hoofs of his horses are reckoned as rock, and his wheels as a storm (<a href="../njhd/50.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 50</a>); from these, when separated from the spiritual man, stream forth all the evils and falsities that are in the church and in its doctrine: evils from this source are signified by "the nations that shall come from far;" and falsities by "him that cometh from the end of the earth;" "far," and "the end of the earth" signifying those things that are remote from the truths and goods of the church. "The arrows that are sharp," and "the bows that are bent" signify the falsities of doctrine prepared to destroy truths, and "the hoofs of the horses that are reckoned as rock," and "his wheels that are as a storm" signify the ultimates of truth, like those in the sense of the letter of the Word, and arguments and confirmations of falsity by means of these; "the hoofs of the horses" mean the ultimates of the understanding, here of the perverted understanding, because separated from the understanding of the spiritual man; and because these ultimates are from the sense of the letter of the Word, it is said, "are reckoned as rock;" while "wheels" mean argumentations and confirmations by means of these, and because these appear strong they are said to be "as a storm."</p><p>[33] In the book of Judges:<p>My heart is toward the lawgivers of Israel. Ye that ride on white asses, and sit on middin, and that walk by the way, meditate. The stars from their courses fought with Sisera. Then were the hoofs of the horses bruised; the prancing of his stout ones struck together (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_9.htm">Judges 5:9-10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_22.htm">22</a>).<p>These words are contained in the song of Deborah and Barak, which treats of the combat of truth against falsity and its victory; "the lawgivers of Israel" signify the truths of the church; "to ride on white asses" and "to sit on middin" signify the perception of good and the understanding of truth, "white asses" signifying the rational in respect to good, and "middin" the rational in respect to truth; and "to walk by the way and to meditate" signify a life of truth; "the stars from their courses fought with Sisera" signifies the knowledges of truth, and combat from them against falsities of evil; "the feet of the horses that were bruised," and "the prancing of the horses that struck together" signify the falsities that are from the outmost natural, or the sensual [sensuali], and arguments therefrom that they were destroyed.</p><p>[34] In Amos:<p>Shall horses run upon the rock? shall one plough with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of justice into wormwood (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_6_12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>).<p>"Shall horses run upon the rock?" signifies, is there any understanding of truth? "Shall anyone plough with oxen?" signifies, is there any perception of good? This is plainly the meaning, for it follows, "for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of justice into wormwood;" "to turn judgment into gall," signifies to turn truth into falsity, and "to turn the fruit of justice into wormwood," signifies to turn good into evil.</p><p>[35] In David:<p>Thou hast laid oppression upon our loins. Thou hast caused a man to ride over our head; We entered into the fire and the waters: but Thou hast brought us out into a broad place (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_11.htm">Psalms 66:11-12</a>).<p>This is a description of spiritual captivity and deliverance therefrom. There is spiritual captivity when the mind is so shut up as not to perceive good nor understand truth; there is deliverance from it when the mind is opened; "the oppression upon the loins" signifies that there is no perception of good of love, for "loins" and "thighs" signify the good of love; "to cause a man to ride over our head" signifies that there is no understanding of truth; "man" here signifying intelligence from self [ex proprio], which is no intelligence; and "head" the like. Because this is the signification therefore it is said, "we entered into the fire and the waters," "into the fire" meaning into the evils that are from the love of self, and "into the waters" meaning into falsities; deliverance therefrom is meant by "but Thou hast brought us out into a broad place," "broad place" signifying truth (as above).</p><p>[36] In Isaiah:<p>Woe to them that go down into Egypt for help, and stay on horses, and trust in the chariot, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah. For Egypt is man and not God, and its horses flesh and not spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_3.htm">3</a>).<p>"Egypt" in the Word signifies the knowing [faculty] [scientificum] which is in the natural man, and thence also the natural man; and because the natural man, with the knowing [faculty] that is in it, has no understanding, but only thought from the memory, which is a kind of imagination from objects of sight and hearing; and because this is beneath the spiritual, in which nevertheless all the goods and truths of heaven and the church reside, therefore "Egypt" signifies in most passages a falsified knowing [faculty] [scientificum falsum]; for when the spiritual man does not flow in, knowledges in the natural man are turned into mere falsities, and its thoughts into confirmations of falsity and into reasonings from them against truths. From this it can be seen what is signified by "horses of Egypt and its chariots," namely, that "the horses" signify false knowledges, and "chariots" doctrinals from which there are reasonings against truth. Such, therefore, seek truths from no other source than themselves, for each one's own [proprium] has its seat in the natural man, and what is not his own has its seat in the spiritual; such persons therefore seize upon falsities instead of truths, and upon evils instead of goods, calling evils goods and falsities truths, and trusting in themselves, because they trust in what is their own. These things are signified by "Woe to them that go down into Egypt, and stay on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong;" "horses" here mean false knowledges; and "chariots" doctrinals therefrom; and "horsemen" reasonings from them against truths; therefore it is also said, "Egypt is man and not God, and his horses flesh and not spirit" signifying that what is in them is merely natural and not spiritual, consequently that there is not in them anything of life; "man" signifying the natural man, and "flesh" what is its own; "God" and "spirit" signifying the Divine spiritual man, and life therefrom; and since they trust in themselves and not in the Lord, it is said, "they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah."</p><p>[37] From this it can now be seen what is signified by the horses, the chariots, and the armies of Pharaoh, in Moses:<p>I will be rendered glorious in Pharaoh and in his army and in his horsemen. And the Egyptians pursued the sons of Israel, and Pharaoh's horses went after them, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea. And Jehovah took off the wheel of their chariots, so that they drove them with difficulty. And when Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, together with the whole army of Pharaoh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_17.htm">Exodus 14:17-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_27.htm">27-28</a>).<p>And in the same:<p>Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto Jehovah. In singing I will sing unto Jehovah, for in exalting He hath exalted Himself; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea, and his chariots and his army (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_15_21.htm">21</a>).<p>What the horses and chariots of Pharaoh or Egypt signify has been shown above; his "army" signifies all falsities, in general and in particular; and "sea" signifies damnation and hell, where all are in their own [proprium], because they are in the natural man separated from the spiritual, and thence in all kinds of evils and falsities. The like is signified by "the horses of Egypt," in these words in Moses:<p>If thou shalt say, <sup>2</sup>I will set over me a king, in setting thou shalt set <sup>3</sup>over thee a king whom Jehovah thy God shall choose; only he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor shall he bring back the people into Egypt, that he may multiply horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_17_14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-16</a>).<p>These things are said of the king, because the Lord in relation to Divine truth is represented by kings, and thence "kings" signify truths from good from the Lord (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_4.htm">Jeremiah 46:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_17_15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_20.htm">23:20</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "his;" see <a href="../ae/175.htm">AE 175</a>, <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>, <a href="../ae/433.htm">433</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "they shall say."<br><br>3.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "he shall set." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 355 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>355.

"Et vidi, et ecce equus albus." - Quod significet intellectum veri ex Verbo, constat ex significatione "equi", quod sit intellectuale; et ex significatione "albi", quod dicatur de vero. <p>(Quod "equus" significet intellectuale constare potest ex illis quae allata et ostensa sunt in opusculo De Equo Albo: et quod "album" dicatur de vero, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_196" target=_top>196</a>.) Dicitur quod "equus albus" visus sit quando Agnus aperuit primum sigillum, et quod "equus rufus" cum secundum, "equus niger" cum tertium, et "equus pallidus" cum quartum; et quia per "equum" significatur intellectuale, in specie quoad Verbum, inde constare potest quod intellectus veri ex Verbo, et ejus quale apud homines ecclesiae, per "equos" hic describatur. Sive dicas quod id describatur, seu illi qui in eo sunt, idem est; nam homines, spiritus et angeli subjecta sunt, in quibus id. Inde sciri potest quid in hoc capite, et in proxime sequentibus, in sensu interno seu spirituali describitur, quod nempe Verbum quoad intellectum. Hoc quoque patet ex versu nono hujus capitis, ubi, postquam visi sunt quatuor illi equi, et tunc apertum sigillum quintum, dicitur quod "viderit animas occisorum propter Verbum Dei": et quoque ex capite 19 hujus Libri, ubi dicitur quod<p>Nomen Ejus qui sedit super equo albo vocetur "Verbum Dei" (vers. 13).<p>Quod intellectuale per "equum" significetur, et quod intellectus veri ex Verbo per "equum album", ostensum videatur in opusculo supra citato De Equo Albo; sed quia ibi solum pauca loca ex Verbo adducta sunt, confirmantia quod "equus" significet intellectuale, ideo velim hic plura adducere, ut plena sit confirmatio; quae sunt sequentia:<p>[2] - Apud Ezechielem,<p>"Congregate vos a circuitu super sacrificium meum quod sacrifico vobis:... satiabimini super mensa mea, equo et curru, forti et omni viro belli;... sic dabo gloriam meam inter gentes" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_39_17" target=_top>39:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_39_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_39_21" target=_top>21</a>):<p>agitur ibi de convocatione omnium ad regnum Domini, et in specie de instauratione eccleSiae apud gentes; agitur enim de captivitate spirituali, in qua fuerunt gentes, et de liberatione ab illa: per "sacrificium" quod sacrificaretur, significatur omnis cultus quo colitur Dominus; per "satiari super mensa mea", significatur omni cibo spirituali, qui quia est intellectus veri ex Verbo et ex doctrina inde, dicitur "equo et curru"; per "equum" significatur intellectus veri ex Verbo, et per "currum" significatur doctrina inde; et quoque dicitur "forti et omni viro belli", et per "fortem" significatur verum ex bono quod destruit malum, et per "virum belli" significatur verum ex bono quod destruit falsum: nisi talia significarentur, quid foret quod satiarentur "equo et curru, forti et omni viro belli"?<p>[3] Similiter in Apocalypsi,<p>"Congregamini ad cenam magni Dei, ut comedatis carnes regum, et carnes chiliarchorum, et carnes fortium, et carnes equorum et sedentium super illis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_17" target=_top>19:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_18" target=_top>18</a>):<p>agitur ibi in praecedentibus de Verbo et ejus sensu spirituali; hic nunc invitantur ad discendum vera et ad percipiendum bona; et per "cenam magni Dei" significatur instructio in veris et inde perceptio boni a Domino; et per "carnes regum", "chiliarchorum", "fortium", "equorum" et "sedentium super illis" significantur omnis generis vera quae ex bono; ("caro" significat bonum, "reges" Divina vera in genere, "chiliarchi" eadem in Specie, "fortes" vera naturalia, "equi" vera intellectualia, et "sedentes super illis" vera spiritualia;) quod ibi non intelligantur carnes regum, chiliarchorum, fortium, equorum et sedentium super illis, cuivis patet.<p>[4] Apud Habakuk,<p>"Num fluviis succensuit Jehovah?

introivimus in ignem et aquas; eduxisti tamen nos in latitudinem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_66_11" target=_top>Psalms 66:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_66_12" target=_top>12</a>):<p>describitur ita captivitas spiritualis, et inde liberatio; captivitas spiritualis est quando mens occluditur ne percipiat bonum et intelligat verum, liberatio ab illa est quando mens aperitur; per "oppressionem super lumbos" significatur quod nulla perceptio boni amoris, "lumbi" enim et "femora" significant bonum amoris: per "equitare facere hominem in capite nostro" significatur quod nullus intellectus veri; per "hominem" hic significatur intelligentia ex proprio, quae nulla intelligentia est, et simile per "caput": quia haec significantur, ideo dicitur, "intravimus in ignem et aquas"; "in ignem" est in mala quae ex amore sui, et "in aquas" est in falsa: liberatio inde intelligitur per "eduxisti tamen nos in latitudinem"; "latitudo" significat verum, ut supra.</p><p>[36] Apud Esaiam,<p>"Vae descendentibus in Aegyptum pro auxilio, et super equis innituntur, et confidunt super curru sed non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, et Jehovam ( <sup>17</sup></p><p>non) quaerunt;... nam Aegyptus homo et non Deus, et equi ejus caro et non spiritus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_31_1" target=_top>31:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_31_3" target=_top>3</a>):<p>per "Aegyptum" in Verbo significatur scientificum quod in naturali homine, et inde quoque naturalis homo; et quia naturalis homo cum scientifico quod in illo non habet aliquem intellectum, sed modo cogitationem ex memoria, quae est species imaginationis ex objectis visus et auditus, quae quia est infra spiritualem, in quo tamen resident omnia bona et vera caeli et ecclesiae, inde per "Aegyptum" in plerisque locis significatur scientificum falsum; nam cum spiritualis homo non influit, vertuntur scientifica naturalis hominis in mere falsa, et cogitationes ejus in confirmationes falsi et in ratiocinationes ex illis contra vera: inde constare potest quid per "equos Aegypti" et per "currus" ejus significatur, nempe quod per "equos" scientifica falsa, et per "currus" doctrinalia ex quibus ratiocinationes contra vera; qui itaque tales sunt, non quaerunt aliunde vera quam ex se; proprium enim cujusvis in naturali homine residet, et non proprium in spirituali; quapropter pro veris arripiunt falsa et pro bonis mala, et haec dicunt bona et illa dicunt vera, ac sibi, quia suo proprio, fidunt: haec significantur per "Vae descendentibus in Aegyptum, et super equis innituntur, et confidunt super curru quod multus, et super equitibus quod validi valde"; "equi ibi sunt scientifica falsa, et "currus" sunt doctrinalia inde, ac "equites" sunt ratiocinationes ex illis contra vera: quare etiam dicitur, "Aegyptus est homo et non Deus, et equi ejus sunt caro et non spiritus", per quod significatur quod mere naturale et non spirituale eis insit, inde nec aliquid vitae; "homo" significat naturalem hominem, et "caro" proprium ejus, "Deus" et "spiritus" significant Divinum spiritualem <sup>18</sup></p><p>hominem et inde vitam; et quoniam illi sibi confidunt, et non Domino, dicitur "Non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, et Jehovam ( <sup>19</sup></p><p>non) quaerunt.</p><p>[37] Ex his nunc videri potest quid significatur per "equos, currus et exercitus Pharaonis", apud Mosen,<p>"Gloriosus reddar in Pharaone et in exercitu ejus, ... et in equitibus ejus...
