<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 954</h4><p>954. (Verse 7) And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the anger of God, who liveth unto ages of ages. That this signifies manifestation from the Lord by means of Divine truth, or the Word, of all the falsities of evil which have destroyed the spiritual life of the men of the church, is evident from the signification of the four animals, as denoting the inmost heaven (concerning which see n. <a href="../ae/277.htm">277</a>, <a href="../ae/322.htm">322</a>, <a href="../ae/462.htm">462</a>), and as denoting the Word (n. <a href="../ae/717.htm">717</a>); consequently, the Lord as to heaven and as to the Word; for heaven is heaven from the Lord, and in like manner the Word; and from the signification of the seven angels, as denoting manifestations by Divine truth, or the Word (see above, n. <a href="../ae/949.htm">949</a>); and from the signification of the seven vials as denoting all falsities and evils. For by the seven vials similar things are signified as by the seven plagues (ver. 6), namely, evils and the falsities therefrom, and falsities and the evils therefrom (see above, n. <a href="../ae/949.htm">949</a>). These are said to be full of the anger of God, who liveth unto ages of ages, because they lay waste the church, and destroy the spiritual life of the men of the church. These are the things signified by the anger of God. From these considerations it is evident, that by one of the four animals giving unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the anger of God, who liveth unto ages of ages, is signified, manifestation from the Lord by means of Divine truth, or the Word, of all the falsities of evil that have destroyed the spiritual life of the men of the church. The reason why vials are mentioned instead of plagues is, that vials are things containing, and plagues are things contained; and, in the Word, the things containing are frequently mentioned instead of the things contained, because the things containing are ultimates, in order that the sense of the letter of the Word may be in ultimates; similarly, where cups and chalices are mentioned instead of wine. But we shall speak further upon this subject in the following chapter, where the seven vials and the seven plagues therein are treated of.<p>Continuation concerning the First Precept:-</p><p>[2] So far as a man resists his own two loves, which are the love of ruling from the sole delight of it, and the love of possessing the goods of the world from the delight of mere possession, and thus, so far as he shuns as sins the evils mentioned in the Decalogue, so far there flows in through heaven from the Lord [that which causes him to acknowledge] that there is a God, who is the Creator and Preserver of the universe, and also indeed that God is one. The reason why this then flows in is that when evils are removed, heaven is opened; and when heaven is opened, a man no longer thinks from himself, but by heaven from the Lord. This is the universal [principle] in heaven, embracing all others, that there is a God, and also that God is one. That, man from influx alone knows and, as it were, sees that God is one, is evident from the common confession of all nations, and from repugnance to think that there are several. The interior thought of man, which is the thought of his spirit, is either from hell or from heaven; it is from hell before evils are removed, but from heaven when they are removed. When it is from hell, then a man recognises only nature as God, and considers that the inmost of nature is what is called Divine. Such a man after death, when he becomes a spirit, calls any one a god who prevails in power, and he also seeks for power himself, in order that he may be called a god; all the evil have such madness lurking inwardly in their spirit. But when man thinks from heaven, as is the case when evils are removed, then he sees from the light from heaven that there is a God, and that He is one. Seeing from light from heaven is what is meant by influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 954</h4><p>954. Verse 7. And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the anger of God, who liveth unto the ages of the ages, signifies all the falsities of evil that have destroyed the spiritual life of the men of the church made manifest by the Lord by means of the Divine truth or the Word. This is evident from the signification of "the four animals," as being the inmost heaven (See n. <a href="../ae/277.htm">277</a>, <a href="../ae/322.htm">322</a>, <a href="../ae/462.htm">462</a>), and as being the Word n. <a href="../ae/717.htm">717</a>, consequently the Lord as to heaven and the Word, for heaven is heaven from the Lord, and the same is true of the Word. Also from the signification of "the seven angels," as being manifestations through the Divine truth or the Word (See above, n. <a href="../ae/949.htm">949</a>). Also from the signification of "the seven vials," as being all falsities and evils, for "the seven vials" have a like signification as "the seven plagues" (verse 6), namely, evils and falsities therefrom, and falsities and evils therefrom (See above, n. <a href="../ae/949.htm">949</a>). These are said to be "full of the anger of God, who liveth unto the ages of the ages," because these devastate the church and destroy the spiritual life of the men of the church. These are what are signified by "the anger of God." All this makes clear that the words, "one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the anger of God, who liveth unto the ages of the ages," signify all the falsities of evil that have destroyed the spiritual life of the men of the church, made manifest by the Lord by means of the Divine truth or the Word. "Vials" are mentioned instead of plagues because vials are the containants, and plagues are the contents; and in the Word the containants are frequently mentioned instead of the contents, because the containants are the ultimates, in order that the sense of the letter of the Word may be in ultimates. Likewise "cups" and "chalices" are mentioned instead of wine. (But see further on this subject in the following chapter, where the seven vials and the seven plagues therein are treated of.)<p>(Continuation respecting the First Commandment)</p><p>[2] So far as a man resists his own two loves, which are the love of ruling from the mere delight of ruling and the love of possessing the goods of the world from the mere delight of possession, thus so far as he shuns as sins the evils forbidden in the Decalogue, so far there flows in through heaven from the Lord, that there is a God, who is the Creator and Preserver of the universe, yea also that God is one. This then flows in for the reason that when evils have been removed heaven is opened, and when heaven is opened man no longer thinks from self but from the Lord through heaven; and that there is a God and that God is one is the universal principle in heaven which comprises all things. That from influx alone man knows, and as it were sees that God is one, is evident from the common confession of all nations, and from a repugnance to thinking that there are many gods. Man's interior thought, which is the thought of his spirit, is either from hell or from heaven; it is from hell before evils have been removed, but from heaven, when they have been removed. When this thought is from hell man sees no otherwise than that nature is God, and that the inmost of nature is what is called the Divine. When such a man after death becomes a spirit he calls anyone a god who is especially powerful; and also himself strives for power that he may be called a god. All the evil have such madness lurking inwardly in their spirit. But when a man thinks from heaven, as he does when evils have been removed, he sees from the light in heaven that there is a God and that He is one. Seeing from light out of heaven is what is meant by influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 954 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>954. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_7" target=_top>7</a>.] "Et unum de quatuor animalibus dedit septem angelis septem phialas aureas plenas ira Dei viventis in saecula saeculorum." - Quod significet manifestata a Domino per Divinum Verum seu Verbum omnia falsa mali quae destruxerunt vitam spiritualem hominum ecclesiae, constat ex significatione "quatuor animalium", quod sint caelum intimum (de qua [supra,] n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_277" target=_top>277</a> [a] , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_322" target=_top>322</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_462" target=_top>462</a>), et quod sint Verbum (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_717" target=_top>717</a> [c]); proinde Dominus quoad caelum et quoad Verbum, nam caelum est caelum a Domino, similiter Verbum; ex significatione "septem angelorum", quod sint manifestationes per Divinum Verum seu Verbum (ut supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_949" target=_top>949</a>); ex significatione "septem phialarum", quod sint omnia falsa et mala, per "septem phialas" enim similia significantur quae per "septem plagas" (vers. 6), nempe mala et inde falsa, ac falsa et inde mala (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_954/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_949" target=_top>949</a>): quae "plenae ira Dei viventis in saecula saeculorum" dicuntur, quia devastant ecclesiam, ac destruunt vitam spiritualem hominum ecclesiae; haec sunt quae significantur per "iram Dei." Ex his constare potest quod per quod "unum de quatuor animalibus dederit septem angelis septem phialas plenas ira Dei viventis in saecula saeculorum", significetur quod manifestata sint a Domino per Divinum Verum seu Verbum omnia falsa mali quae destruxerunt vitam spiritualem hominum ecclesiae. <p>Quod "phialae" dicantur pro plagis, est quia phialae sunt continentia, et plagae contenta, ac in Verbo utplurimum continentia dicuntur pro contentis, quia continentia sunt ultima, ut sensus litterae Verbi in ultimis sit; similiter ubi "pocula" et "calices" dicuntur pro vino. (Sed de hac in sequente capite, ubi de "septem phialis et inibi septem plagis" agitur.)<p>[2] (Continuatio de Primo Praecepto.)<p>Quantum homo resistit binis amoribus propriis, qui sunt amor imperandi ex solo jucundo imperii, et amor possidendi bona mundi ex solo jucundo possessionis, et sic quantum fugit mala ut peccata quae in decalogo, tantum per caelum a Domino influit quod Deus sit, qui Creator et Conservator universi, immo etiam quod Deus unus sit. Causa, quod hoc tunc influat, est quia cum remota sunt mala, caelum apertum est; et cum caelum est apertum, homo non amplius ex se, sed per caelum ex Domino cogitat; et hoc in caelo universale est, complectens omnia, quod Deus sit, et quoque quod Deus unus sit. Quod homo ex solo influxu sciat et quasi videat quod Deus unus sit, constare potest ex communi omnium gentium confessione, et ex renisu cogitandi quod plures sint. Interior cogitatio hominis, quae est cogitatio spiritus ejus, vel ex inferno est, vel ex caelo est; ex inferno est antequam remota sunt mala, ex caelo autem dum remota sunt. Quando ex inferno est, tunc homo non videt aliud quam quod Natura sit Deus, et quod intimum Naturae sit quod vocatur Divinum. Talis homo post mortem, dum fit spiritus, quemlibet qui potentia valet, vocat deum; et quoque ipse affectat potentiam ut dicatur deus; talis vesania est omnibus malis latens in spiritu eorum. Quando autem homo ex caelo cogitat, quod fit dum remota sunt mala, tunc videt ex luce in caelo quod Deus sit, et quod Deus unus sit. Visus ex luce e caelo, est qui intelligitur per influxum. </p>
