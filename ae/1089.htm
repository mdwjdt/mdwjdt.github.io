<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1089</h4><p>1089. Which hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth. That this signifies domination over the truths of the church, is evident from the signification of having a kingdom, as denoting domination, and from being predicated of truths or falses; that kingdom denotes the church as to truths or falsities may be seen (n. <a href="../ae/48.htm">48</a>, <a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>, <a href="../ae/685.htm">685</a>); and from the signification of the kings of the earth, as denoting truths, see n. <a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>, <a href="../ae/1034.htm">1034</a>, <a href="../ae/1063.htm">1063</a>, <a href="../ae/1073.htm">1073</a>; and from the signification of the earth, as denoting, the church, of which we have frequently spoken above. Hence it is evident, that by having a kingdom over the kings of the earth, is signified domination over the truths of the church.<p>That it is domination over the truths of the church is because their chief, who is called Pope and Pontiff, makes his own edicts of equal sanctity, and of like inspiration, with the truths of the Word. It is also of their doctrine that it is lawful for him to alter the truths of the Word according to the changes of the state of the church, and thus to change them into such things as are a means of domination, which are falsities. For all the things that look to domination are falsities, or truths falsified. For the end chooses and applies to itself the means; and the means applied to an end, which is domination over the souls of men, over all things of the church, and over heaven, cannot be truths. And if they are truths, still the end falsifies them; but with those [only] who are in [the lust of] dominion.<p>Continuation concerning the Word:-</p><p>[2] The absolute truth is, that no one can understand the Word without doctrine; for he may be led away into errors of every kind, to which he may incline from some love, or to which he may be drawn from some principle, by which his mind becomes vague and uncertain, so that at length it is, as it were, without truth. But he who reads the Word from doctrine sees all the things that confirm it, and also many things which are hidden from the eyes of others. Nor does he allow himself to be drawn into strange [doctrines]. Hence it is that his mind is made up so that he sees definitely.</p><p>[3] The reason why the Word may be turned to confirm even heresies, unless it is read from doctrine, is, that its literal sense consists of pure correspondences, and these, for the most part, are appearances of truth, and in part, genuine truths, which can be neither seen nor distinguished unless doctrine be the lamp.</p><p>[4] But doctrine cannot be procured except from the Word, and only by those who are enlightened by the Lord. Those who love truths because they are truths, and incorporate them in their life, are enlightened. Moreover, everything of doctrine must be confirmed by the literal sense of the Word, because therein Divine truth is in its fulness and in its power, and by this a man is in conjunction with the Lord, and associated with the angels.<p>In a word, he who loves truth because it is truth may, as it were, interrogate the Lord in doubtful matters of faith, and receive answers from Him, but nowhere else than in the Word, because the Lord is the Word.<p>THE END OF THE FIFTH VOLUME. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1089</h4><p>1089. Which hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth, signifies its domination over the truths of the church. This is evident from the signification of "having a kingdom," as being domination, and as being predicated of truths or falsities. That "kingdom" means the church in respect to truths or falsities, may be seen (n. <a href="../ae/48.htm">48</a>, <a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>, <a href="../ae/685.htm">685</a>). Also from the signification of "kings of the earth," as being truths (See n. <a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>, <a href="../ae/1034.htm">1034</a>, <a href="../ae/1063.htm">1063</a>, <a href="../ae/1073.htm">1073</a>). Also from the signification of "earth," as being the church (of which frequently above). This makes clear that "having a kingdom over the kings of the earth" signifies domination over the truths of the church. There is domination over the truths of the church because their chief, who is called Pope and Pontiff, ascribes to his own decrees an equal holiness and a like inspiration with the truths of the Word. It is also a part of this doctrine that it is lawful for him to change the truths of the Word according to the changes of the state of the church, and thus to turn them into such things as may be means of domination, and these are falsities; for all things that have regard to domination are falsities, or truths falsified, since the end chooses the means and applies them to itself; and means that are applied to an end which is domination over the souls of men, over all things of the church and over heaven, cannot be truths, and if they are truths the end falsifies them, but with those only who are in dominion.<p>(Continuation respecting the Word)</p><p>[2] It is an invariable truth that no one can understand the Word without doctrine; for he may be led away into any errors to which he may be inclined from some love, or to which he may be drawn from some principle, whereby his mind becomes unsettled and uncertain, and at length as it were destitute of truth. But he who reads the Word from doctrine sees all things that confirm it, and many things that are hidden from the eyes of others, and does not permit himself to be drawn away into strange things; and thus his mind becomes so settled as to see with certainty. The Word may be drawn away to confirm heresies unless it is read from doctrine, for the reason that the sense of its letter consists of mere correspondences, and these are in great part appearances of truth, and in part genuine truths, and unless there be doctrine for a lamp these cannot be seen and cannot be distinguished from each other.</p><p>[3] But doctrine can be acquired from no other source than from the Word, and it can be acquired only by those who are in enlightenment from the Lord. Those are in enlightenment who love truths because they are truths and make them to be of their life. Moreover, all things of doctrine must be confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word, because the Divine truth is in its fullness and in its power in that sense, and through it man is in conjunction with the Lord and in consociation with the angels. In brief, he who loves truth because it is truth can inquire of the Lord, as it were, in doubtful matters of faith, and can receive answers from Him, but nowhere except in the Word, for the reason that the Lord is the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1089 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1089. "Habens regnum super reges terrae." - Quod significet dominationem ejus super vera ecclesiae, constat ex <sup>1</sup></p><p>significatione "regnum habere", quod sit dominatio, ac dicatur de veris aut de falsis; quod "regnum" sit ecclesia quoad vera aut falsa, videatur [supra] (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_48" target=_top>48</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_684" target=_top>684</a> [a] , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_685" target=_top>685</a>): ex significatione "regum terrae, quod sint vera (de qua supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_31" target=_top>31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_625" target=_top>625</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1034" target=_top>1034</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1063" target=_top>1063</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1089/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1073" target=_top>1073</a>): et ex significatione "terrae", quod sit ecclesia (de qua saepius): inde patet quod per "habere regnum super reges terrae" significetur dominatio super vera ecclesiae. Dominatio super vera ecclesiae, est quia summus eorum, qui vocatur papa et pontifex, dictata sua aequalis sanctitatis et similis inspirationis facit cum veris Verbi; tum quod ex doctrina sit, quod liceat ei immutare vera Verbi secundum mutationes status ecclesiae, et sic convertere illa in talia quae sunt media ad dominationem, quae sunt falsa; nam omnia quae spectant dominationem sunt falsa, aut vera falsificata; finis enim eligit media et applicat sibi, et media applicata fini, qui est dominatio super animas hominum, super omnia ecclesiae et super caelum, non possunt esse vera; et si sunt vera, usque finis falsificat illa, sed apud illos qui in dominio sunt.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Verbo.)<p>Constans veritas est quod nemo possit intelligere Verbum absque doctrina; abduci enim potest in quoscunque errores, in quos ex aliquo amore inclinat, aut ex aliquo principio trahitur; per quod mens ejus fit vaga et incerta, et tandem fit sicut absque vero: at qui legit Verbum ex doctrina, is videt omnia quae illam confirmant, et quoque plura quae latent coram oculis aliorum, nec patitur se abstrahi in aliena; inde fit mens ejus determinata, ut videat certum. Quod Verbum possit trahi ad confirmandum etiam haereses, nisi ex doctrina legatur, est quia sensus litterae ejus ex meris correspondentiis consistit, et illae quoad plurem partem sunt apparentiae veri, et quoad partem genuina Vera, quae non videri nec distingui possunt, nisi doctrina sit lucerna.<p>[3] At doctrina non aliunde comparanda est quam ex Verbo; et non ab aliis quam qui in illustratione sunt a Domino; in illustratione sunt, qui amant vera quia vera sunt, et faciunt illa suae vitae. Insuper omnia doctrinae confirmanda sunt per sensum litterae Verbi, quia in illo est Divinum Verum in suo pleno, et in sua potentia, et per illum est homo in conjunctione cum Domino, et in consociatione cum angelis. In summa, qui amat verum quia est verum, is potest quasi interrogare Dominum in dubiis fidei, et responsa ab Ipso ferre; sed non alibi quam in Verbo, ex causa, quia Dominus est Verbum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
