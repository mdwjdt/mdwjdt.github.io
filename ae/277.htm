<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 277</h4><p>277. (Verse 6) And in the midst of the throne, and roundabout the throne, were four animals full of eyes before and behind. That this signifies the guardianship and providence of the Lord to prevent the interior heavens being approached except by the good of love and of charity, that lower things thence depending may be in order, is evident from the signification of in the midst of the throne, as denoting from the Lord; for He who sat upon the throne was the Lord, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/268.htm">268</a>); and from the signification of roundabout the throne as denoting the interior or higher heavens, these being most nearly round-about the Lord; and from the signification of four animals, which were cherubim, as denoting the Divine guardianship and providence to prevent the interior or higher heavens from being approached except by the good of love and of charity, which will be explained in what follows; and from the signification of eyes, of which they were full, before and behind, as denoting the Divine providence of the Lord; for eyes when said of man signify the understanding, which is his internal sight; but when eyes are said of God, they signify the Divine providence, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/68.htm">68</a>, <a href="../ae/152.htm">152</a>). And because eyes there signify the Divine providence of the Lord to prevent the higher heavens from being approached except by the good of love and of charity, therefore those cherubim were seen full of eyes, before and behind. The reason why lower things, which are the lower heavens, and also the church on earth, depend on that providence of the Lord, that they may be in order, is that the influx of the Lord is immediate from Himself, and also mediate through the higher into the lower heavens, and into the church; therefore unless the higher heavens are in order the lower cannot be in order (concerning which influx see <a href="../njhd/277.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 277</a>, <a href="../njhd/278.htm">278</a>).</p><p>[2] That cherubim are here meant by the four animals is evident in Ezekiel, by whom similar things were seen at the river Chebar, which are described by him in chapters l. and x., and in the latter are called cherubim (verses 1, 2, 4-9, 14, 16, 18, 19). Concerning them it is said,<p>"The cherubim lifted themselves up; these animals which I saw by the river Chebar. These animals that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; I understood that they were the cherubim" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_15.htm">10:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_20.htm">20</a>).<p>These four animals which were the cherubim, are thus described by the same prophet:<p>Near the river of Chebar "appeared the likeness of four animals of which this was the aspect: They had the likeness of a man, and they had each four faces, and they had each of them four wings: This was the likeness of their faces: the four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side, and the four had the face of an ox on the left side, the four also had the face of an eagle. The appearance of them was as burning coals of fire, like the appearance of lamps; it went up and down among the animals, so that the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. Over the heads of the animals was an expanse according to the form of a wonderful crystal: over the expanse which was over their head, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it; from the appearance of his loins and downwards I saw as it were the appearance of a fire, and it had brightness round about, as the aspect of a rainbow that is in the cloud; this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_22.htm">22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">26-28</a>).<p>By these representatives is described the Divine of the Lord in the higher heavens, and His providence to prevent them from being approached except by the good of love and of charity; and in that description are contained all the things mentioned in this chapter of the Apocalypse concerning the arrangement of the heavens, and they are signified by the throne upon which sat one in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardine; also by the rainbow about the throne, by the lamps of fire burning before the throne, and other things, which it would therefore be needless to explain, particularly in this place.</p><p>[3] It shall now only be shown that by cherubim in the Word are signified the guardianship and providence of the Lord, to prevent the higher heavens from being approached except by the good of love and of charity, that lower things may be in order. This is clearly manifest from the account of the cherubim placed before the garden of Eden, when man was driven out; concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>"When" Jehovah God "had driven out the man, he made cherubim to dwell on the east of Eden, and a flame of a sword turning itself every way, to keep the way of the tree of life" (<a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>).<p>From the men who constitute those two churches on earth the two higher heavens are formed; when, therefore, the celestial church, which was the most ancient and primary church on this earth, declined and began to recede from the good of love, then it is said that cherubim were made to dwell on the east of the garden of Eden, and a flame of a sword which turned itself every way, to guard the way of the tree of life. By the east of Eden is signified where the good of celestial love enters; and by the flame of a sword which turned itself every way is signified truth from that good defending; and by the tree of life is signified the Divine which is from the Lord in the higher heavens, which is the good of love and charity, and heavenly joy therefrom. Hence it is evident that by cherubim are signified guards to prevent those heavens being approached except by the good of love and of charity; and on this account it is also said, "to guard the way of the tree of life." (That the east signifies the good of love, may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1250.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1250</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3708.htm">3708</a>; that Eden signifies wisdom therefrom, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/99.htm">99</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/100.htm">100</a>; that sword signifies truth fighting against falsity and dispersing it, thus truth defending [see above], n. <a href="../ae/73.htm">73</a>, <a href="../ae/131.htm">131</a>; that flame signifies truth from celestial good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9570.htm">9570</a>; that the tree of life signifies the good of love from the Lord and heavenly joy therefrom, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/109.htm">109</a>, <a href="../ae/110.htm">110</a>).</p><p>[4] On account of this signification of cherubim there were two made of solid gold placed upon the propitiatory upon the ark, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>"Thou shalt make cherubim, of solid gold shalt thou make them, from the two extremities of the propitiatory; from the propitiatory thou shalt make the cherubs, and let the cherubim be expanding their wings upward, covering with their wings the propitiatory; towards the propitiatory shall be the faces of the cherubim, and thou shalt put the propitiatory upon the ark. I will meet thee there, and I will speak with thee between the two cherubim" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9457.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9457</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10545.htm">10545</a>; by the ark, the inmost or third heaven, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9485.htm">9485</a>; by the testimony or the law in the ark, the Lord as to the Word, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3382.htm">3382</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7463.htm">7463</a>; by the habitation which was without the veil, the middle or second heaven, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9485.htm">9485</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9594.htm">9594</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9596.htm">9596</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9632.htm">9632</a>; by the propitiatory, the hearing and reception of all things of worship which are from the good of love and of charity from the , n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9506.htm">9506</a>, and by gold, the good of love, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/113.htm">113</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9510.htm">9510</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9874.htm">9874</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9881.htm">9881</a>).</p><p>[5] And because by the cherubim were signified guards, therefore also, there were cherubim upon the curtains of the habitation, and upon the veil (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>; hence the oracle signifies their inmost. That olive wood signifies the good of love, may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/886.htm">Arcana Coelestia 886</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3728.htm">3728</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4582.htm">4582</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9780.htm">9780</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9954.htm">9954</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10261.htm">10261</a>, and likewise the gold, see above, n. <a href="../ae/242.htm">242</a>. That doors signify approach and admission may be seen also above, n. <a href="../ae/248.htm">248</a>).</p><p>[6] Similarly, the new temple is described as ornamented with cherubim; concerning which it is thus written in Ezekiel:<p>"Cherubim and palm trees were made, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; thus was it done to all the house round about; from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and the wall of the temple" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_41_18.htm">41:18-20</a>).<p>The palm signifies spiritual good, which is the good of charity (as may be seen, Arcana Coelestia. n. 8369).</p><p>[7] Because the Divine truth from the Divine good is that which protects, therefore the king of Tyre is called a cherub; for by king is signified Divine truth, and by Tyre are meant knowledges (cognitiones); and hence by the king of Tyre is signified intelligence, concerning which it is thus written in Ezekiel:<p>King of Tyre, "thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering. Thou cherub, the spreading out of one that protects; I have placed thee in the mount of holiness of God; thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways in the day that thou wast created" (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>, and by Tyre knowledges, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1201.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1201</a>. That by precious stones are signified the truths and goods of heaven and of the church, see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9863.htm">9863</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9873.htm">9873</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>, which are called stones of fire, because fire signifies the good of love, as may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/934.htm">934</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>). Because the king of Tyre signifies intelligence from Divine truth, and this guards or protects, therefore the king of Tyre is called the cherub, the spreading out of one that protects.</p><p>[8] Because the higher heavens cannot be approached except by means of the good of love and of charity, that is, cannot be approached by worship and by prayers unless they proceed from that good, therefore the Lord communed with Moses and Aaron, when they entered the habitation, between the two cherubim that were upon the ark (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>); as also is evident in Moses:<p>"When Moses entered into the tent of assembly he heard a voice speaking unto him from over the propitiatory that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim " (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Num. 7:89</a>).<p>Because it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord which provides and guards, therefore it is said of the Lord,<p>That He sitteth upon the cherubim, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>; Psa. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">18:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_1.htm">80:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_99_1.htm">99:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_4_4.htm">1 Sam. 4:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_6_2.htm">2 Sam. 6:2</a>.</p><p>[9] Because the subject treated of in this chapter is the arrangement of all things for judgment therefore also the cherubim are here treated of, that the guardianship and providence of the Lord that the higher heavens may not be approached except by means of the good of love and of charity; for unless this had been done before the Judgment, the very heavens themselves, in which were the true angels, would have been endangered, because those heavens which were about to perish (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Apoc. 21:1</a>) were not in the good of love and charity, but only in some truths. For there were there those from the Christian world who were in the doctrine of faith alone, which some had confirmed from a few passages of the Word, and by that means had obtained some kind of conjunction with the ultimate heaven; but this conjunction was broken when that heaven, which is called the former heaven, had passed away. It was then ordained by the Lord, that hereafter no one should be conjoined with the heavens unless he be in the good of love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbour; this is what is specifically meant by the things that now follow in this chapter. Whoever, therefore, believes that the heavens can hereafter be approached by the worship and by the prayers of those who are in faith alone and not also in the good of charity, is much deceived. The worship of these is no longer received, nor are their prayers heard, but the love of their life alone is regarded. Wherefore if the love of self and of the world reign, in whatever external worship they may have been, they are conjoined to the hells, and are also borne thither after death, and not in the first place to some heaven that is about to perish, as was previously the case. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 277</h4><p>277. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four animals, full of eyes before and behind, signifies the Lord's guard and providence that the interior heavens be not approached except by the good of love and charity, that lower things depending thereon may be in the order. This is evident from the signification of "out of the midst of the throne," as being from the Lord, for the "One sitting upon the throne" was the Lord (See above, n. <a href="../ae/268.htm">268</a>); also from the signification of "around the throne," as being the interior or higher heavens, for these are most nearly around the Lord; also from the signification of "four animals," which were cherubim, as being the Divine guard and providence that the interior or higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and charity (of which in what follows); also from the signification of "eyes," of which they were full before and behind, as being the Lord's Divine Providence; for "eyes," in reference to man, signify the understanding, which is his internal sight; but when "eyes" are predicated of God, they signify the Divine Providence (See above, n. <a href="../ae/68.htm">68</a>, <a href="../ae/152.htm">152</a>). And since "eyes" here signify the Lord's Divine Providence that the higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and of charity, therefore these cherubim were seen "full of eyes before and behind."<p>On this providence of the Lord, lower things, which are the lower heavens and also the church on earth, depend, that they may be in order, because the influx of the Lord is both immediate from Himself, and also mediate through the higher heavens into the lower heavens and into the church; consequently unless the higher heavens were in order the lower could not be in order. (On this influx see <a href="../njhd/277.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 277-278</a>.)</p><p>[2] That by "the four animals" here cherubim are meant is evident in Ezekiel, by whom like things were seen at the river Chebar, which are described by him in chap. 1 and in chap. 10, and in the latter called "cherubim" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_4.htm">4-9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_18.htm">18-19</a>), and it is said of them:<p>The cherubim mounted up; these are the animals that I saw by the river Chebar. These are the animals that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_16.htm">Ezekiel 10:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_20.htm">20</a>).<p>These "four animals, that were cherubim," are thus described by that prophet:<p>Near the river Chebar appeared the likeness of four animals. This was their aspect: they had the likeness of a man, and each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. This was the likeness of their faces: the four of them had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side, and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four of them had the face of an eagle. Their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of lamps; the same went up and down among the animals, so that the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. Over the heads of the animals was an expanse of the appearance of a wonderful crystal. Above the expanse which was over their head was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man upon it. From the appearance of his loins and downwards I saw as it were an appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about, as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud; so was the appearance of the brightness of Jehovah round about; this appearance was the likeness of the glory of Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_22.htm">22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">26-28</a>).<p>By these representatives the Divine of the Lord in the higher heavens, and His Providence that they be not approached except from the good of love and charity, are described; and in this description are contained all the things that are mentioned in this chapter of Revelation respecting the arrangement of the heavens, and signified by "the throne on which was One sitting in aspect like a jasper stone and a sardius;" also by the "rainbow round about the throne," by the "lamps of fire burning before the throne," and the other things which it is not necessary therefore to explain here singly.</p><p>[3] It shall now be shown merely that "cherubim" in the Word signify the guard and providence of the Lord that the higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and charity, that lower things may be in order. This is plainly seen by the cherubim placed before the garden of Eden, when man was driven from it, which are thus described in Moses:<p>When Jehovah God had driven out the man, He made to dwell on the east of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword turning hither and thither, to guard the way of the tree of life (<a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>). Of the men who constitute these two churches on the earth the two higher heavens are formed. When, therefore, the celestial church, which was the most ancient and primary church on this earth, declined and began to recede from the good of love, it is said that "cherubim were made to dwell on the east of Eden, and the flame of a sword turning hither and thither, to guard the way of the tree of life." The "east of Eden" signifies where the good of celestial love enters; "the flame of a sword turning hither and thither" signifies truth from that good, protecting; and "the tree of life" signifies the Divine that is from the Lord in the higher heavens, which is the good of love and charity and heavenly joy therefrom. From this it is clear that "cherubim" signify guards that these heavens be not approached except through the good of love and charity; for this reason they are also said "to guard the way of the tree of life." (That the "east" signifies the good of love, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1250.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1250</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3708.htm">3708</a>; that "Eden" signifies wisdom therefrom, n. <a href="../ae/99.htm">99</a>, <a href="../ae/100.htm">100</a>; that "sword" signifies truth combating against falsity and dispersing it, thus truth protecting, above, n. <a href="../ae/73.htm">73</a>, <a href="../ae/131.htm">131</a>; that "flame" signifies truth from celestial good, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3222.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9570.htm">9570</a>; that "the tree of life" signifies the good of love from the Lord and the heavenly joy therefrom, see above, n. <a href="../ae/109.htm">109</a>, <a href="../ae/110.htm">110</a>.)</p><p>[4] Because of this signification of "cherubim," two cherubim of solid gold were placed upon the mercy-seat which was upon the ark, thus described in Moses:<p>Thou shalt make cherubim, of solid gold thou shalt make them, from the two ends of the mercy-seat; out of the mercy-seat thou shalt make the cherubim.

Because the "king of Tyre" signifies intelligence from Divine truth, and this guards or protects, therefore the king of Tyre is called "a cherub, the spreading out of one that protects."</p><p>[8] Since the higher heavens cannot be approached except through the good of love and charity, that is, cannot be approached through worship and through prayers, except such as proceed from that good, therefore the Lord spoke with Moses and Aaron when they entered the habitation between the two cherubim that were upon the ark (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). This also is made evident in Moses:<p>When Moses went into the tent of meeting, he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>).<p>Because it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord that provides and guards, therefore it is said of the Lord that:<p>He sitteth upon the cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalms 18:9-10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_1.htm">80:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_99_1.htm">99:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_4_4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_6_2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>).</p><p>[9] Since the arrangement of all things for judgment is treated of in this chapter, the cherubim also are here treated of, that is, the Lord's guard and providence that the higher heavens be not approached except through the good of love and charity; for unless this had been done before the judgment, the veriest heavens, in which the true angels are, would have been endangered, because those heavens that were about to perish (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>) were not in the good of love and charity, but only in some truths. For there were there from the Christian world those who were in the doctrine of faith alone, which some had confirmed by a number of passages from the Word, and thus obtained some conjunction with the ultimate heaven; but this conjunction was broken when the heaven called the former heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>) was dissipated; and it was then ordered by the Lord that hereafter no one shall be conjoined with the heavens unless he be in the good of love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor. This is what is specifically meant by the things that now follow in this chapter. Whoever, therefore, believes that the heavens can hereafter be approached through the worship and prayers of those who are in faith alone, and not at the same time in the good of charity, is much mistaken. The worship of such is no longer received, nor are their prayers heard, but attention is directed only to their life's love. Those, therefore, in whom the love of self and the world rules, no matter in what external worship they may have been, are conjoined to the hells, and are also taken there after death, and not previously to any heaven that is to perish, as was the case hitherto.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For "in the day" the Hebrew has "from the day," as also found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/114.htm">Arcana Coelestia 114</a>. </p>

Hoc patet evidenter ex cherubis positis ante hortum Edenis, quando homo inde expulsus est; de quibus ita apud Mosen:<p>"Cum" Jehovah Deus "expulisset hominem, habitare fecit ab oriente Edenis cherubos, et flammam gladii hinc inde vertentis se, ad custodiendum viam arboris vitae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_277/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_24" target=_top>Genesis 3:24</a>);<p>quid per "hominem" et ejus "uxorem" in iis capitibus intelligitur, videatur explicatum in Arcanis Caelestibus; quod nempe per "hominem" ibi intelligatur Ecclesia Antiquissima, quae erat ecclesia caelestis; et ecclesia caelestis distinguitur ab ecclesia spirituali in eo, quod illa sit in bono amoris in Dominum, haec autem in bono charitatis erga proximum (videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_277/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_20" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 20-28</a>). Ex hominibus qui faciunt binas illas ecclesias in terris formantur bini caeli superiores.
