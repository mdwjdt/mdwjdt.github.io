<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 992</h4><p>992. Because of their anguish and because of their sores. That this signifies from the loathing and nauseating of genuine goods and truths, arising from the evils and falsities in which those are who are in faith alone, is evident from the signification of anguish, as denoting the loathing of genuine goods and truths, arising from the falsities in which those are who are in faith alone (concerning which see n. 990), and from the signification of sores, as denoting nausea from evils of the life. That by sores are signified the evil deeds from man's proprium, and thence the falsifications of truth and good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/962.htm">962</a>). The reason why nausea is signified is, that pain from the sores is meant, because of which they blasphemed the God of heaven; but still pain on that account is not meant, but an utter distaste for truths and the goods from them.<p>Continuation concerning the Sixth Precept:-</p><p>[2] It has been said that the love of adultery is a fire enkindled from impurities, which soon burns out and is turned into cold, and into an aversion corresponding to hatred. But it is quite different with the love of marriage. This is a fire enkindled from the love of good and truth, and from the delight of well-doing, thus from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbour. This fire, which from its origin is heavenly, is full of innumerable delights - as many as are the delights and blessednesses of heaven. It has been told me that the delights and pleasantness of that love, which are alternately manifested, are so many and so great that they cannot be numbered and described. They are also multiplied and continually increased to eternity. Those delights originate from this fact, that conjugial partners desire to become one as to their minds, and that heaven, from the marriage of good and truth from the Lord there, acts in such a union.</p><p>[3] I will here relate some particulars concerning the marriages of angels in heaven. They say that they are in continual potency; that afterwards there is never any weariness, much less sadness, but alacrity and cheerfulness of mind. That conjugial partners mutually pass the night in each other's bosoms, as if they had been created as one; that effects are constantly open, so that they are never deficient where they desire, because without these their love would be as the source of a fountain stopped up. The effect opens that source, and makes it continuous, and also conjunction, so that they may become as one flesh as it were, for the vitality of the man adds itself to the vitality of the wife, and causes union. They say, that the delights arising from the effects cannot be described in any language in the natural world, and can be thought only by means of spiritual ideas, and even these cannot exhaust it. These things have been told me by the angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 992</h4><p>992. Because of their distresses and their sores, signifies from loathing and nausea towards genuine truths and goods arising from the evils and falsities in which those are who are in faith alone. This is evident from the signification of "distresses," as being loathing toward genuine truths and goods arising from the falsities in which those are who are in faith alone (See n. <a href="../ae/990.htm">990</a>; also from the signification of "sores," as being nausea arising from evils of the life. That "sores" signify the evil works that are what is man's own [proprium) and consequent falsifications of truth and good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/962.htm">962</a>]. Nausea is signified because pain from the sores on account of which they blasphemed the God of heaven is meant, and yet not pain on that account, but nausea for truths and for the goods therefrom.<p>(Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment)</p><p>[2] It has been said that the love of adultery is a fire enkindled from impurities that soon burns out and is turned into cold, and into an aversion corresponding to hatred. But the reverse is true of the love of marriage. This is a fire enkindled from the love of good and truth and from the delight in well-doing, thus from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbor. This fire, which from its origin is heavenly, is full of innumerable delights, as many, in fact, as are the delights and blessednesses of heaven. It has been told me that the charms and pleasantnesses of that love which are manifested from time to time are so many and such that they cannot be numbered or described. Moreover, they are multiplied with continual increase to eternity. These delights have their origin in the fact that the married pair wish to be united into one as to their minds, and into such a union heaven breathes from the marriage of good and truth from the Lord in heaven.</p><p>[3] I will here say something about the marriages of angels in heaven. They declare that they are in continual potency, that after the acts there is never any weariness, still less any sadness, but eagerness of life and cheerfulness of mind, that the married pair pass the night in each other's bosoms as if they were created into one, that effects are constantly open, that they are never lacking when they have desire, since without these their love would be like the channel of a fountain stopped up. The effect opens that channel and causes continuance and conjunction that they may become as one flesh; for the vital of the husband adds itself to the vital of the wife and binds together. They declare that the delights of the effects cannot be described in the expressions of any language in the natural world, nor be thought of in any except spiritual ideas, and that even these do not exhaust them. These things have been told me by the angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 992 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>992. "Prae molestiis suis et prae ulceribus suis" - Quod significet ex fastidiis et nauseis ad genuina vera et bona, oriundis ex falsis et malis in quibus sunt qui in sola fide, constat ex significatione "molestiarum", quod sint fastidia ad genuina vera et bona, oriunda ex falsis, in quibus sunt qui sola in fide (de qua (supra), n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_992/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_990" target=_top>990</a>); et ex significatione "ulcerum", quod sint nauseae ex malis vitae; quod per "ulcera" significentur mala opera quae ex proprio hominis, et inde falsificationes veri et boni, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_992/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_962" target=_top>962</a>); quod nausea significetur, est quia intelligitur dolor ex ulceribus, propter quem blasphemarunt Deum Caeli, sed usque nonintelligitur dolor propterea, sed nausea pro veris et bonis ex illis.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Sexto Praecepto.)<p>Dictum est quod amor adulterii sit ignis ex impuris incensus, qui brevi deflagrat, et vertitur in frigus, ac in aversationem correspondentem odio: vicissim autem amor conjugii; hic est ignis accensus ex amore boni et veri et ex jucundo benefaciendi, ita ex amore in Dominum et ex amore erga proximum; hic ignis, qui ex orgine sua est caelestis, plenus est jucundis innumerabilibus, quot scilicet sunt jucunditates et beatitudines caeli: dictum mihi est quod totidem et tales deliciae et amoenitates in illo amore sint, quae per vices manifestantur, ut non in numerum nec in descriptionem cadant; multiplicantur etiam cum augmentis in aeternum. Origo illarum jucunditatum est ex eo, quod conjuges velint uniri in unum quoad mentes, et quod in talem unionem conspiret caelum ex conjugio boni et veri a Domino ibi.<p>[3] Velim aliqua de conjugiis angelorum in caelo referre. Dicunt quod in potentia sint continua; quod post actus nusquam sit lassitudo, minus maestitia, sed alacritas vitae et hilaritas animi; quod conjuges in sinu mutui pernoctent sicut in unum creati sunt; quod effectus constanter sint aperti, ut nusquam desint dum volunt, quia absque his foret amor sicut vena obturata fontis; effectus illam aperit, et facit perennitatem, et quoque conjunctionem ut fiant sicut una caro, nam vitale viri se addit vitali uxoris, et copulat: dicunt quod deliciae effectuum non possint describi vocibus alicujus linguae in naturali mundo nec cogitari ideis nisi quam spiritualibus, quae tamen non exhauriunt. Haec ab angelis mihi dicta sunt. </p>
