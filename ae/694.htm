<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 694</h4><p>694. And thine anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged.- That this signifies the last judgment upon those who interiorly possess in themselves nothing of good and truth, is evident from the signification of anger, as meaning in reference to the Lord, a last judgment (concerning which see above n. 413); that this is signified here by anger is clear, for the words, "and the time of the dead, to be judged" follow; and from the signification of the dead, as denoting those who interiorly possess in themselves nothing of good and truth. Such are called dead, because the very life of man is his spiritual life, for through this he is a man, and is distinguished from the beasts, which have only a natural life. In man the natural life without the spiritual life is dead, since it has not heaven in itself, which is called life and also eternal life, but hell, which is spiritually called death. That those who live a natural life merely, and not at the same time a spiritual life, are meant by the dead in the Word, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/78.htm">78</a>). That death, when spoken of man, means a lack of ability to understand truth and perceive good, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/550.htm">550</a>); and this defect exists when the internal spiritual man has not been formed, for this is formed by means of truths from good. In this internal man resides the faculty of understanding truth and of perceiving good, for this man is in heaven and in the light thereof, and he who is in the light of heaven is a living man. But when the natural man only has been formed, and not at the same time the spiritual, then there is no faculty of understanding and perceiving the truths and goods of heaven and of the church, because such a man has no light from heaven; for this reason such a man is called dead. That those who do not interiorly possess in themselves anything of good and truth are here meant by the dead who are to be judged, is evident also from what has been said before about the separation of the evil from the good before the Last Judgment, and from this, that the evil, when they have been separated, come into their interiors, which abound in mere evils and falsities; this makes it clear, that interiorly they were dead, although in the external form they appeared to be living. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 694</h4><p>694. And Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, signifies the Last Judgment upon those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth. This is evident from the signification of "anger" as being, in reference to the Lord, the Last Judgment (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/413.htm">413</a>. This is evidently the signification of "anger" here, for it is added, "and the time of the dead to be judged." Also from the signification of "the dead," as being those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth. Such are called "dead" because the essential life of man is his spiritual life, for it is through this that he is a man and is distinguished from beasts, which have only natural life. In man the natural life without the spiritual life is dead, since it has not in itself heaven, which is called "life" and "eternal life," but has hell, which is spiritually called "death." In the Word, the "dead" mean those who live a natural life only, and not at the same time a spiritual life (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/78.htm">78</a>; also "death," in reference to man, means a lack of the faculty of understanding truth and perceiving good (See above, n. <a href="../ae/550.htm">550</a>); and this lack exists when the internal spiritual man has not been formed, for this is formed by means of truths from good. In that internal man the ability to understand truth and perceive good has its seat, for that man is in heaven and in its light, and he who is in the light of heaven is a living man. But when the natural man only has been formed, and not at the same time the spiritual, there is no faculty of understanding and perceiving the truths and goods of heaven and the church, because that man has no light from heaven. For this reason such a man is called "dead." That those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth are here meant by "the dead who are to be judged," can be seen from what has been said before about the separation of the evil from the good before the Last Judgment, and that the evil, when they have been separated, come into their interiors, which swarm with mere evils and falsities; from which it is clear that inwardly they were dead, although in external form they appeared to be living. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 694 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>694. "Et venit ira tua, et tempus mortuorum judicari" - Quod significet ultimum judicium super illos qui nihil boni et veri intus apud se possident, constat ex significatione "irae", cum de Domino, quod sit ultimum judicium (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_694/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_413" target=_top>413</a>); quod id per "iram" hic significetur, patet, nam sequitur, "tempus mortuorum", et "judicari": et ex significatione "mortuorum", quod sint qui nihil boni et veri intus apud se possident; quod hi dicantur "mortui" est quia ipsa vita hominis est vita spiritualis ejus, nam per hanc est ille homo, ac distinguitur a bestiis quae modo vitam naturalem habent; haec vita absque spirituali vita apud hominem, est mortua, quoniam in se non habet caelum quod vocatur "vita" ut et "vita aeterna", sed infernum quod vocatur "mors" spiritualiter; quod illi intelligantur per "mortuos" in Verbo qui solam vitam naturalem vivunt, et non simul spiritualem, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_694/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_78" target=_top>78</a>); etiam quod per "mortem", cum de homine, intelligatur defectus facultatis intelligendi verum et percipiendi bonum (etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_694/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_550" target=_top>550</a>); et is defectus est quando non internus spiritualis homo formatus est, ille enim formatur per vera ex bono. In interno illo homine residet facultas intelligendi verum et percipiendi bonum, nam ille homo in caelo est et in ejus luce; et qui in caeli luce est, is est vivus: at quando solum naturalis homo formatus est, et non simul spiritualis, tunc non aliqua facultas est intelligendi et percipiendi vera et bona caeli et ecclesiae, quia ei non est aliqua lux e caelo; inde est quod talis homo dicatur "mortuus." Quod illi qui intus apud se non aliquid boni et veri possident, intelligantur hic per "mortuos qui judicandi", constare etiam potest ex antecedentibus, ubi actum est de separatione malorum a bonis ante ultimum judicium, et quod mali, cum separati sunt, in interiora sua, quae scatent meris malis et falsis, veniant; ex quo patet quod intus mortui fuerint, tametsi apparuerint in externa forma sicut vivi. </p>
