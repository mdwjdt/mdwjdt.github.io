<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 857</h4><p>857. (Verse 3) And they sang, as it were, a new song. That this signifies, concerning the acknowledgment and confession of the Lord, is evident from the signification of a song, as denoting confession from joy of heart; and of a new song, as denoting the acknowledgment and confession of the Lord, thus His glorification; concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/326.htm">326</a>).<p>Song is mentioned in many passages of the Word, and especially in David; and by this is signified the confession and glorification of God by singing. And where a new song is mentioned, it signifies the confession and glorification of the Lord; for this song is called new, because in the churches, before the Lord's Advent, Jehovah was celebrated by songs; but after the Lord came into the world, and made Himself manifest, the Lord also was celebrated by songs; but now in the church, hereafter to be established, which is meant by the New Jerusalem, the Lord alone will be celebrated. And because it was the same Lord in the ancient churches, but celebrated under the name of Jehovah, who is now called the Lord, and thus the song concerning Him, strictly, is not new, therefore it is said, as it were a new song. This therefore is called new, because for the New Church, hereafter to be established by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 857</h4><p>857. Verse 3. And they were singing as it were a new song, signifies respecting acknowledgment and confession of the Lord. This is evident from the signification of a "song," as being confession from joy of heart; and of "a new song," as being acknowledgment and confession of the Lord, thus glorification of Him (See above, n. <a href="../ae/326.htm">326</a>). Songs are mentioned in many passages of the Word, especially in David, and they signify confession and glorification of God by singing; and where it is said "a new song" confession and glorification of the Lord is signified, for this song is called new for the reason that in the churches before the Lord's coming Jehovah was praised in songs; and after the Lord had come into the world and had manifested Himself He too was praised in songs; while now in the church that is hereafter to be established, which is meant by "the New Jerusalem," the Lord alone will be praised; but as it was the same Lord in the ancient churches, although praised under the name "Jehovah" who is now called the Lord, and as thus the song respecting Him, regarded in itself, is not new, so it is said to be "as it were a new song." Here, therefore, it is called new, because it is for the New Church which is hereafter to be established by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 857 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>857. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_857/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_3" target=_top>3</a>.] "Et canebant tanquam canticum novum." Quod significet de agnitione et confessione Domini, constat ex significatione "cantici", quod sit confessio ex gaudio cordis, et "cantici novi", quod sit agnitio et confessio Domini, ita glorificatio Ipsius (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_857/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_326" target=_top>326</a> [a]). In Verbo multis in locis, et praecipue apud Davidem, dicitur "canticum", et per id significatur confessio et glorificatio Dei per cantum; et ubi dicitur "canticum novum", significatur confessio et glorificatio Domini, nam hoc canticum vocatur "novum", ex causa quia in ecclesiis ante adventum Domini per cantica celebrabatur Jehovah; at postquam Dominus in mundum venit, et se manifestavit, per cantica etiam celebrabatur Dominus; at nunc in ecclesia quae posthac instauranda est, quae intelligitur per "Novam Hierosolymam", celebrabitur Dominus solus; et quia idem Dominus fuit in ecclesiis antiquis, sed celebratus sub nomine Jehovae, qui nunc Dominus vocatur, et quia sic canticum de Ipso in se spectatum non est novum, ideo dicitur "tanquam canticum novum"; hic itaque "novum" vocatur, quia pro nova ecclesia, quae posthac a Domino instauranda est. </p>
