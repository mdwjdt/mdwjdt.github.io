<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 70</h4><p>70. The reason why the feet are said to be like unto fine brass is, that by fine brass is meant brass polished and shining, like something fiery; and brass in the Word signifies natural good. Metals, like all other things in the Word, are significative. Gold in the Word signifies celestial good, which is inmost good; silver signifies its truth, which is spiritual good; brass natural good, which is ultimate good, and iron its truth, which is natural truth. That such things are signified by metals, is from correspondence; for many things are seen in heaven shining like gold and silver, and also many things shining like brass and iron. And it is there known, that by those things are signified the above-mentioned kinds of good and truth; this is why the ancients, who were in the knowledge of correspondences, named the ages after those metals. The first age they called the golden age, because innocence, love and wisdom therefrom, then reigned; but the second age they called the silver age, because truth from that good, or spiritual good, and intelligence therefrom, then reigned; the third age they called the brazen, or copper, age, because only natural good, which is what is just and sincere pertaining to moral life, then reigned; but the last age they called the iron age, because only truth without good then reigned, and when that reigns, then also falsity reigns. The reason why the ages were thus distinguished, was from the spiritual signification of those metals.</p><p>[2] From these considerations it is evident what is signified by the statue of Nebuchadnezzar, seen in his dream,<p>"whose head was of gold, the chest and arms of silver, the belly and thighs of brass, the legs of iron, and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_32.htm">Dan. 2:32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_33.htm">33</a>).<p>The state of the church from its first time to its last as to good and truth, is here signified; its last time was when the Lord came into the world.<p>When it is known that gold signifies celestial good, silver spiritual good, brass natural good, and iron natural truth, many arcana in the Word where those metals are mentioned can be known. For example, what is signified by these words in Isaiah:<p>"For brass I will bring gold, for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron; I will also make thy government peace, and thine exactors justice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_17.htm">60:17</a>).</p><p>[3] But as the signification of brass is what is here treated of, as being natural good, it is necessary only to adduce a few passages where brass is mentioned and signifies that good. Thus in Moses:<p>"Asher acceptable to his brethren, and dipping his foot in oil; iron and brass thy shoe, and as thy day, thy fame" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_25.htm">25</a>).<p>Asher, as one of the tribes, signifies the happiness of life, and the delight of the affections (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_8_9.htm">9</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"I will give thee unto this people for a fortified wall of brass, that they may fight against thee, and not prevail over thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_15_20.htm">15:20</a>).<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>"Javan, Tubal, and Mesech, they were thy merchants; with the soul of man and vessels of brass they gave thy merchandise" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">27:13</a>).<p>In this chapter the merchandises of Tyre are treated of, by which are signified the knowledges (cognitiones) of good and truth. By the names Javan, Tubal, and Mesech, are signified those things that pertain to good and truth, to which the knowledges relate; the soul of man denotes the truth of life; vessels of brass denote scientifics of natural good.</p><p>[4] (What is signified by Tyre, may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_7.htm">1:7</a>).<p>(What the cherubs and the feet signify, may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">40:3</a>).<p>Because the angel here mentioned measured the wall and the gates of the house of God, which signify the externals of the church, his appearance was seen to be the appearance of brass.<p>He who knows that brass signifies the external of the church, which in itself is natural, may in some measure understand why the altar of burnt-offering was overlaid with brass, and the gate round it was of brass, and the vessels of brass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1-4</a>), also why the great vessel, which was called the sea, with the twelve, oxen under it, and the ten lavers with the bases, and also all the vessels of the tabernacle for the house of God, were made by Solomon of polished brass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_43.htm">1 Kings 7:43-47</a>). He who knows what brass signifies, can also enter into the arcanum why a serpent of brass was commanded to be set up for the people to look at, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>"Jehovah sent serpents among the people, which bit the people. And he said unto Moses, Make thee a serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten, when he hath looked upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that when a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked upon the serpent of brass, he lived" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_9.htm">9</a>).<p>That the Lord was signified by that serpent, He himself teaches in John:<p>"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_14.htm">3:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_15.htm">15</a>).<p>By the serpent is signified the ultimate of life in man, which is called the external Sensual, which is natural. To represent this ultimate, which in the Lord was Divine, among the sons of Israel, with whom all things were representative, a serpent of brass was made; and the signification was, that, if they looked to the Divine Human of the Lord, they would revive, that is, if they believed in Him, they should have eternal life, as the Lord himself also teaches. (That to see in the spiritual sense is to believe, may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_19.htm">Dan. 7:19</a>; and other places, will be seen in the following pages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 70</h4><p>70. The feet are said to be "like unto burnished brass," because burnished brass is polished brass, shining from something fiery; and "brass" in the Word signifies natural good. Metals are equally significative with the rest in the Word. "Gold" in the Word signifies celestial good, which is inmost good; "silver" signifies the truth thereof, which is spiritual good: "brass" natural good which is outmost good, and "iron" the truth thereof, which is natural truth.<p>Metals have such significations from correspondence; for in heaven many things are seen shining as if from gold and silver, and also many things as if from brass and iron; and it is there known that by these the goods and truths mentioned above are signified. It was from this that the ancients, who had a knowledge of correspondences, named the ages according to these metals; calling the first age the "golden," because innocence, love, and wisdom therefrom then ruled; but the second "silver," because truth from that good, or spiritual good, and intelligence therefrom then ruled; the third age "brazen" or "copper," because mere natural good, which is justness and sincerity of moral life, then ruled; but the last age they called "iron," because mere truth without good then ruled, and when that rules, falsity also rules. All this was from the spiritual signification of these metals.</p><p>[2] From this it can be known what is signified by the image seen in a dream by Nebuchadnezzar:<p>The head of which was of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the belly and sides of brass, the legs of iron, and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_23.htm">Daniel 2:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_33.htm">33</a>);<p>namely, the state of the church in respect to good and truth, from its first time to its last; its last time was when the Lord came into the world. When it is known that "gold" signifies celestial good, "silver" spiritual good, "brass" natural good, and "iron" natural truth, many arcana in the Word, where these metals are mentioned, can be understood. Thus what is signified by these words in Isaiah:<p>For brass I will bring gold, for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron; I will also make thy government peace, and thine exactors justice (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>).</p><p>[3] But as the signification of "brass," as meaning natural good, is here treated of, I will cite only a few passages where "brass" is mentioned, as signifying that good. Thus in Moses:<p>Asher acceptable unto his brethren, and dipping his foot in oil. Thy shoe iron and brass, and as thy days thy fame (<a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>I saw and behold there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, and a line of flax was in his hand; and he was standing in the gate (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>).<p>It was because this angel measured the wall and the gates of the house of God, which signify the externals of the church, that his appearance was seen as the appearance of brass. He who knows that "brass" signifies the external of the church, which in itself is natural, can in some measure know why:<p>The altar of burnt-offering was overlaid with brass, and the grating about it was of brass, and the vessels of brass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1-4</a>);<p>as also why:<p>The great vessel, which was called the sea, with the twelve oxen under it, and the ten lavers with the bases, and also all the vessels of the tabernacle for the house of God, were made by Solomon of polished brass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_43.htm">1 Kings 7:43-47</a>).</p><p>[5] He who knows what "brass" signifies may also enter into the arcanum why it was commanded that a serpent of brass be set up for the people to look at, of which it is thus written in Moses:<p>Jehovah sent serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And He said unto Moses, Make thee a serpent, and set it upon a standard, and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a standard; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_8.htm">8-9</a>).<p>That this "serpent" signified the Lord, He Himself teaches in John:<p>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have everlasting life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>).<p>By the "serpent" is signified that which is the ultimate of life with man, and is called the external sensual, which is the natural. Because this ultimate in the Lord was Divine, a serpent of brass was made among the sons of Israel, with whom all things were representative; and this signified that if they would look to the Divine Human of the Lord they would live again, that is, if they would believe in Him they would have eternal life, as the Lord Himself also teaches. (That to "see" is in the spiritual sense to believe, see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_19.htm">Daniel 7:19</a> where), will be seen in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 70 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>70. Quod pedes dicti sint "similes chalcolibano", est quia chalcolibanum est aes levigatum micans ex quodam igneo, et "aes" in Verbo significat bonum naturale. Sunt metalla aeque significativa ac reliqua in Verbo; "aurum" ibi significat bonum caeleSte, quod est bonum intimum; "argentum" significat verum ejus, quod est bonum spirituale; "aes" bonum naturale, quod est bonum ultimum; et "ferrum" verum ejus, quod est verum naturale. Quod metalla significent illa, est ex correspondentia; apparent enim in caelo plura fulgentia sicut ex auro et argento, et quoque plura sicut ex aere et ferro, et notum est ibi quod per illa significentur memorata bona et vera. Inde est, quod antiqui, qui in scientia correspondentiarum fuerunt, appellaverint saecula secundum illa metalla; primum saeculum, "Aureum", quia tunc regnabat innocentia, amor, et inde sapientia; secundum autem saeculum, "Argenteum", quia tunc regnabat verum ex illo bono, seu bonum spirituale, et inde intelligentia; tertium saeculum, "Aeneum" seu "Cupreum", quia tunc regnabat modo bonum naturale, quod est justum et sincerum moralis vitae; ultimum autem saeculum vocabant "Ferreum", quia tunc regnabat modo verum absque bono, et cum id regnat, tunc quoque regnat falsum: haec omnia ex significatione spirituali illorum metallorum.<p>[2] Ex his constare potest quid significatur per statuam Nebuchadnezari in somnio visam<p>Cujus "caput erat ex auro, pectus et brachia ex argento, venter et latus ex aere; crura ex ferro, et pedes partim ex ferro partim ex luto" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_2_32" target=_top>Daniel 2:32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_2_33" target=_top>33</a>);<p>quod nempe status ecclesiae quoad bonum et Verum, a primo tempore usque ad ultimum ejus; ultimum ejus fuit quando Dominus in mundum venit.
