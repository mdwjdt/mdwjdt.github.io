<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 845</h4><p>845. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast. That this signifies that those who are in enlightenment should inquire into the nature of the belief in this religious persuasion, is evident from the signification of having understanding, as denoting to be in enlightenment; of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of counting, as denoting to inquire. The reason why counting signifies to inquire is, that in the two senses of the Word - the sense of the letter and the spiritual sense - words are used according to their subjects. Thus to count is said of number, and to inquire, is used in reference to the quality of faith; and from the signification of the number of the beast, as denoting the nature of the belief in this religious persuasion. That number signifies the nature of faith, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/841.htm">841</a>); and that the beast signifies faith separate from life, which is the belief in this religious persuasion. Hence it is evident, that "He who hath understanding let him count the number of the beast," signifies, that those who are in enlightenment should inquire into the nature of the belief in this religious persuasion.<p>The reason why those who are in enlightenment are to make inquiry is, that the nature of the faith in this religious persuasion cannot be seen by any others, nor, consequently, inquired into. For every thing in the Word, by which inquiry ought to be made, and from which a judgment is formed, is in the light of heaven, and hence can be seen only from that light; and this light is that which enlightens man. To inquire therefore into the nature of the belief in any religion - which nature is confirmed by some passages of the Word - can be done only by those who are in the light of heaven, consequently who are in enlightenment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 845</h4><p>845. He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast, signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion. This is evident from the signification of "having intelligence," as meaning to be in enlightenment (of which presently); also from the signification of "to count," as being to inquire into. "To count" signifies to inquire into because in the two senses of the Word, namely, in the literal sense and in the spiritual sense, words are used in agreement with their subjects; that is, "to count" is predicated of number, and to inquire into is predicated of the quality of faith. Also from the signification of "the number of the beast" as being the quality of the faith of this religion. That "number" signifies the quality of faith, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/841.htm">841</a>), also that "the beast" signifies faith separated from life, which is the faith of that religious principle. From this it is clear that "he that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast" signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion. Those who are in enlightenment are to make the inquiry because the quality of the faith of that religion can be seen and thus can be inquired into by no others. For everything of the Word by which inquiry must be made and from which there can be judgment is in the light of heaven, and therefore can be seen only from that light, and it is that light which enlightens man; therefore to inquire into the quality of the faith of any religion which has been confirmed by some passages of the Word can be done only by one who is in the light of heaven, consequently who is in enlightenment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 845 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>845. "Habens intelligentiam computet numerum bestiae." Quod significet quod qui in illustratione sunt, inquirant quale fidei hujus religiosi, constat ex significatione "habens intelligentiam", quod sit qui in illustratione est (de qua sequitur); ex significatione "computare", quod sit inquirere; causa quod "computare" significet inquirere, est quia in binis sensibus Verbi, nempe in sensu litterali et in sensu spirituali, verba praedicantur secundum sua subjecta; ita "computare" de numero, et inquirere de quali fidei: et ex significatione "numeri bestiae", quod sit quale fidei hujus religiosi; quod "numerus" significet quale fidei, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_845/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_841" target=_top>841</a>); et quod "bestia" significet fidem separatam a vita, quae fides est hujus religiosi: inde constare potest, quod "Habens intelligentiam computet numerum bestiae", significet quod qui in illustratione sunt, inquirant quale fidei hujus religiosi. Quod illi qui in illustratione sunt, inquisituri sint, est quia quale fidei istius religiosi ab aliis non videri potest, ita nec inquiri; nam omne Verbi, per quod fiet inquisitio, et ex quo judicatio, in luce caeli est, et inde non nisi quam ex illa luce potest videri, et illa lux est quae illustrat hominem; quare inquirere quale fidei alicujus religionis, quod confirmatum est per aliqua loca ex Verbo, non alius potest quam qui in luce caeli est, proinde qui in illustratione est. </p>
