<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 87</h4><p>87. (Verse 19) Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter. That this signifies that all those things are for posterity, because they are Divine, is evident from the signification of writing, as being that it was for remembrance (concerning which, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8620.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8620</a>), thus, that those things were for posterity; and from the signification of "which thou hast seen, and which are, and which shall be hereafter" as being all things; for the three times, namely, the past, the present and the future, signify all things; and because the things which he should write were from the Lord, therefore they signify things Divine, for nothing can proceed from the Lord but what is Divine. The various particulars, also, recorded in the Apocalypse, as well as those which are in the other prophetical parts of the Word, have an internal sense, and the internal sense is in the light of heaven, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. It is here said, "which thou hast seen, and which are, and which shall be," because it was spoken above concerning the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, and there the Lord Himself is treated of; but here the Divine things from Him with man are treated of, as is evident from what precedes and from what follows in the series. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 87</h4><p>87. Verse 19. Write the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which are to be hereafter, signifies that all these things are for posterity, because Divine. This is evident from the signification of "writing," as being that it is for remembrance (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8620.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8620</a>), thus that these things are for posterity; and from the signification of "which thou sawest," and "which are," and "which are to be hereafter," as meaning all things; for the three times, namely, past, present, and future, signify all things; and since the things he was to write were from the Lord, therefore they signify things Divine, since nothing proceeds from the Lord except what is Divine. Moreover, every particular recorded in Revelation, as well as every particular in the prophetical parts of the Word elsewhere, has an internal sense, and the internal sense is in the light of heaven, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. It is said here, "which thou sawest," and "which are," and "which are to be," because above it was said in respect to the Lord, "who is, and who was, and who is to come." What was there treated of was the Lord Himself; but here things Divine from the Lord with man are treated of, as can be seen from what precedes and from what follows in the series. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 87 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>87. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_19" target=_top>19</a>.) "Scribe quae vidisti, et quae sunt, et quae futura sunt <sup>1</sup></p><p>fieri posthac." Quod significet ut omnia posteritati sint quia Divina, constat ex significatione "scribere", quod sit quod ad reminiscentiam (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_87/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8620" target=_top>8620</a>), ita quod sint posteritati; et ex significatione "quae vidisti, et quae sunt, et quae futura posthac", quod sint omnia, nam tria tempora, nempe praeteritum, praesens, et futurum significant omnia; et quia illa quae scriberet a Domino erant, ideo significant Divina, nam a Domino nihil nisi quam Divinum procedit. Singula etiam quae in Apocalypsi scripta sunt, aeque ac singula quae in propheticis Verbi alibi, sensum internum habent, ac sensus internus est in luce caeli, quae est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino. Hic dicitur "quae vidisti, et quae sunt, et quae futura", quia supra de Domino dictum est "qui est et qui fuit et qui venturus": ibi, ubi ita dictum est, actum est de Ipso Domino; hic autem de Divinis ab Ipso apud hominem, ut constare potest a praecedentibus et sequentibus in serie.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
