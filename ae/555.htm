<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 555</h4><p>555. And they had hair as the hair of women.- That this signifies that they also seem to themselves to be natural affections for truth, is evident from the signification of hair, as denoting things pertaining to the natural man, and specifically truths scientific therein; see above (n. <a href="../ae/66.htm">66</a>); and from the signification of women, as denoting affections, of which we shall speak presently. Hair signifies those things that pertain to the natural man, because the head signifies those things that pertain to the spiritual man, and all things of the natural man clothe all things of the spiritual man, as the hair invests the head. The head also corresponds to things spiritual, and the hair to things natural, therefore they are also significative. It is from this correspondence that the angels appear adorned with beautiful hair, and that, according to its orderly arrangement, gracefulness and neatness, the quality of the correspondence of their natural man with the spiritual, may be known. Now since women signify affections, it is evident, that by the [locusts] having hair as the hair of women, is signified that those meant by the locusts appear to themselves as natural affections [for truth]. This is also evident from the series of things treated of; for their faces being as the faces of men, signifies the appearing to be as it were spiritual affections for truth; therefore it now follows, that by their hair being as the hair of women, is signified the appearing to be as it were natural affections for truth. Presently also it is said of their teeth that they were as the teeth of lions, which signify the ultimates of the natural man as to knowledge and as to power. In the prophetic Word the terms woman, daughter, and virgin are frequently used. But hitherto the signification of them has not been known. That a woman, daughter, and virgin, are not meant, is very evident, for they are mentioned where the church is treated of; but the spiritual signification of them may be seen from the series of the things treated of in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[2] That a woman signifies the church as to the affection for truth, and thence the affection for the truth of the church, is clear from the following passages in the Word.<p>Thus in Jeremiah:<p>"Wherefore commit ye evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of Judah?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_7.htm">44:7</a>).<p>Again, in the same prophet:<p>"I will disperse man and woman; I will disperse old and young, and I will disperse the young man and the virgin" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_22.htm">51:22</a>).<p>So in Ezekiel:<p>"The old man and young man, both the virgin, the infant, and the women, slay to destruction" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_9_6.htm">9:6</a>).<p>And in Lamentations:<p>"They ravished the women in Zion, and the virgins in the cities of Judah. Princes were hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders were not honoured" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_11.htm">5:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_12.htm">12</a>).<p>Here, by man and woman, old man and infant, youth and virgin, are not meant man, woman, old man, infant, youth, and virgin, but everything pertaining to the church. By man and woman are signified truth and its affection, by old man and infant, wisdom and innocence, by youth and virgin, the understanding of truth and the affection for good. That such things are signified is evident from the fact that the church is treated of in these chapters, and its desolation as to its good and truth, wherefore by those names are signified such things as pertain to the church. For the Word is interiorly spiritual, because it is Divine, wherefore if by man and woman, old man and infant, young man and virgin, such were meant, the Word would be natural and not spiritual; but when by man and woman is meant the church as to truth and its affection, by old man and infant, the church as to wisdom and innocence, and by young man and virgin, the church as to intelligence and its affection, then it becomes spiritual. Man also is man, by virtue of the church being in him, and where the church is, there is heaven. When, therefore, mention is made of an old man, a young man, a male infant (homo infans), a male (homo vir), a woman, and a virgin, these expressions signify whatever pertains to the church, corresponding to their age, sex, inclination, affection, intelligence, and wisdom.</p><p>[3] That by woman is signified the church as to the affection for truth, or the affection for the truth of the church, is also clear from these words in Isaiah:<p>"Then seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name; take away our reproach" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_1.htm">4:1</a>).<p>The subject here is the end of the church, when there is no longer any truth, for these words precede: "Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy strength in the war" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_25.htm">3:25</a>), which signify that the understanding of truth would be destroyed by falsities, so that there would be no longer resistance in combats; and these words follow: "In that day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_2.htm">4:2</a>). This is said concerning the coming of the Lord, and signifies that truth should spring up anew in the church. By seven women taking hold of one man, is signified that from affection they would desire and seek truth, but would not find it, man denoting truth, women affections or desires for truth, and seven what is holy. That they would not find instruction in genuine truths, and thus spiritual nourishment, is signified by their saying, "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel," bread denoting instruction and spiritual nourishment, and apparel truth clothing good. That it is truth only which can be applied, and by application conjoined, is signified by, only let us be called by thy name. And because all beauty is from the spiritual affection for truth and conjunction therefrom, and otherwise there is no beauty, therefore it is added, "take away our reproach."</p><p>[4] So in Jeremiah:<p>"Return, O virgin of Israel, return into thy cities. How long wilt thou go about? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">31:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_22.htm">22</a>).<p>The subject here is the spiritual captivity in which the church was before the coming of the Lord. The church is said to be in spiritual captivity, when there is no truth, and yet truth is desired; in such captivity were the Gentiles, with whom the church was established. Return, O virgin of Israel, return into thy cities, signifies, that they should return to the truths of doctrine, the virgin of Israel denoting the church, and her cities truths of doctrine; for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man, signifies the establishment of a new church, in which truth will be conjoined to its affection. To create a new thing in the earth denotes to establish that new thing; woman denotes the church as to the affection for truth, man denotes truth, and to compass denotes to be conjoined.</p><p>[5] And in Isaiah:<p>"As a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit, Jehovah hath called thee, and a woman of youth, when she is cast off, said thy God. For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee again" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_6.htm">54:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_7.htm">7</a>).<p>Here also by a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit, is meant the church, which is not in truths, but still in the affection or desire for them, woman denoting the church, which is said to be forsaken when it is not in truths, and afflicted in spirit, when in grief from the affection or desire for truths. By a woman of youth is meant the Ancient Church, which was in truths from affection; and by the same cast off, is meant the Jewish church, which was not in truths from any spiritual affection; the establishment of a new church by the Lord, and liberation from spiritual captivity, are meant by, "for a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee again."</p><p>[6] And in Jeremiah:<p>"Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear perceive the word of his mouth, that ye may teach your sons mourning, and a woman her companion, lamentation. For death is come up through the windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the infant from the broad way, and the young man from the streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_20.htm">9:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_21.htm">21</a>).<p>The reason why it was said to the women, that they should hear and perceive, is, that they signify the church from the affection for and reception of truth. By the sons whom the women should teach mourning, and by the companion whom a woman should teach lamentation, are signified all who are of the church; by sons, they who are in the truths of the church; by companion, she who is in the good thereof, while mourning and lamentation signify that these things were to be done on account of the church vastated as to its truths and good; by death is come up through the windows, and is entered into our palaces, is signified the entrance of infernal falsity into the understanding, and thence into everything of thought and affection, windows denoting the understanding, and palaces, everything, of thought and affection; to cut off the infant from the broad way, and the young man from the streets, signifies the vastation of truth in the birth, and of the truth that is born, infant in the broad way denoting truth springing up, or in the birth, and young men in the streets denoting the truth that is born.</p><p>[7] So in Ezekiel:<p>"There were two women, the daughters of one mother, and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth; the name of the elder, Oholah, and the name of her sister, Oholibah; and they bare sons and daughters. Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_2.htm">23:2-4</a>).<p>Since Samaria, the metropolis of the Israelites, signifies, in the Word, the spiritual church, and Jerusalem, the metropolis of the Jews, the celestial church, each as to doctrine, therefore they are called women. And, because both those churches act as one, they are therefore called the daughters of one mother, for a mother also signifies the church, and also Oholah and Oholibah, or the tent or habitation of God, have the same signification, for this signifies heaven where Divine Truth and Divine Good are, consequently, also, where the church is; for the church is the heaven of the Lord on earth. By their committing whoredom in Egypt in their youth, is signified, that they were then in no truths, but in falsities, for in Egypt they had not the Word. This was afterwards given to them through Moses and the prophets, and thus the church was instituted among them. To commit whoredom in Egypt, signifies, to falsify truths by scientifics (scientifica) pertaining to the natural man, and to falsify truths there, denotes to turn holy things into magic, as the Egyptians did. The sons and daughters whom they brought forth, signify the falsities and evils of the church.</p><p>[8] So in Micah:<p>"Ye strip the coat from them that pass by securely that are returned from war. The women of my people have ye cast out from the house of their delights" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_2_8.htm">2:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_2_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Here, by stripping the coat from them that pass by securely who are returned from war, is signified to deprive of truths all those who are in truths, and who have combated against falsities. Those who pass by securely denote all those who are in truths; men returning from war, denote those who have been in temptations, and have combated against falsities. By casting out the women of the people from the houses of their delights, signifies to destroy the affections for truth, and thereby the pleasures and happiness of heaven. The women of the people denote the affections for truth, and the houses of their delights the pleasures and happiness of heaven, for these are the affections, for good and truth.</p><p>[9] So in Zechariah:<p>"For I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women shall suffer violence" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_2.htm">14:2</a>).<p>By all nations are signified evils and falsities of every kind; by Jerusalem is signified the church; by city, doctrine; by house, everything that is holy of the church; by women are signified the affections for truth, and by their suffering violence is signified that truths shall be perverted, and that thence the affections for truth will perish.</p><p>[10] So again, in the same prophet:<p>"In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, and the land shall mourn every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their women apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their women apart; the family of the house of Levi apart, and their women apart; the family of Simeon apart, and their women apart; all the families that remain, every family apart, and their women apart" (<a href="../ae/430.htm">430</a>, <a href="../ae/431.htm">431</a>). Jerusalem signifies the church and its doctrine.</p><p>[11] Thus also in Matthew:<p>"Then shall two be in the field, the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill, and one shall be taken, and the other left" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4334.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4334</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4335.htm">4335</a>).</p><p>[12] So in Moses:<p>"I will break for you the staff of your bread, that ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_26_26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>).<p>These words in the spiritual sense, mean that truth from good, by which men are spiritually nourished, shall fail; for bread signifies every kind of spiritual food that is for the nourishment of the man of the church. Women signify those of the church who are in the affection for truth. By ten women baking bread in one oven, is signified, that they shall search for truth that may be conjoined to good, but shall only find a very little; for to bake signifies to prepare and conjoin so as to serve for the use of life. To deliver the bread by weight, signifies that it is rare; and to eat and not be satisfied, signifies, because truth from good is so scanty and rare, as scarcely to yield any spiritual nourishment for the soul.</p><p>[13] Again, in Moses:<p>"A woman shall not wear the raiment of a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth so is abomination unto Jehovah thy God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>).<p>Here a man (vir) and his raiment signify truth, and a woman and her garment the affection for truth. These are distinct in every man (homo), as understanding and will, or as thought which is of the understanding and affection which is of the will, and unless they were distinct, the sexes would be confounded, and no marriage would be effected, in which the man (vir) is the truth of the thought, and the woman the affection. That man and woman were both so created that they might be two and yet one, is evident from the book of Genesis, in which it is said concerning their creation, "So God created man (homo) into his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_5_2.htm">5:2</a>).</p><p>[14] And afterwards:<p>"The man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore she shall be called wife, because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh" (<a href="../hh/7.htm">Heaven and Hell 7-12</a>, <a href="../hh/51.htm">51-58</a>). By male is signified here, as above, the truth of the understanding, and by female, the good of the will. The wife said to be bone of the bones, and flesh of the flesh of the man (vir), signifies that good, which is the wife, is from the truth which is the man. Bone signifies truth before it is vivified, that is, conjoined to good, such as is the truth of the memory with man; and since all good is formed from truths, it is said, "because she was taken out of man." That a man (vir) shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, signifies that truth must be of good, and that hence both shall become one good; this is signified by their being one flesh, flesh signifying good, and also man (homo). The things now stated cannot enter into the understanding of man, with few exceptions, unless it be known that the subject treated of in the first two chapters of Genesis is the new creation, or regeneration of the men of the church. In the first chapter their regeneration is treated of, in the second chapter their intelligence and wisdom; and by male and female, or by man (vir) and wife, is meant, in the spiritual sense, the conjunction of truth and good, which is called the heavenly marriage. Into this marriage man comes when he is regenerated and becomes a church; and man is regenerated and becomes a church when he is in good and thence in truths, which is meant by the words "a man (vir) shall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh." But a still clearer idea may be obtained, upon this subject, from what is said in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, concerning good and truth (n. <a href="../njhd/11.htm">11-19</a>); concerning the will and understanding (n. <a href="../njhd/28.htm">28-33</a>); concerning regeneration (n. <a href="../njhd/173.htm">173-182</a>); also concerning good from which truths are derived (n. <a href="../njhd/24.htm">24</a>).</p><p>[15] Since by man and woman is signified the conjunction of truth and good, therefore Moses, when he saw that the sons of Israel took to themselves the female captives of the Midianites their enemies, commanded that they should kill every woman that had known man (vir) by lying with him, but that they should keep alive the women that had not known [man] (Num. 30:16-18). These things were commanded because a woman (femina) not conjoined to a man signified the church as to the affection for truth, or for conjunction with truth; but a woman (mulier) conjoined to a Midianitish man, signified good adulterated. For the Midianites represented, and thence signified, the truth which is not truth because not from good, consequently falsity; and hence it was that the women were to be slain who had known man, and that those who had not known man were to be preserved alive. That the Midianitish women signified the defilement of good by falsities, and thence good adulterated and profaned, which is foul adultery, is evident from the circumstances related concerning the whoredom of the sons of Israel with the women of the Midianites (Numbers xxv.).</p><p>[16] He who does not know that a woman signifies the spiritual affection for truth, and he who does not know that the evils and falsities which are present in every one are in the natural man, and not any in the spiritual man, cannot know the signification of that which is written concerning a female captive, in Moses:<p>"If thou seest in captivity a beautiful woman," from thine enemies, "and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldst have her to thy wife; thou shalt bring her into the midst of thy house, where she shall shave her head and pare her nails; then she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and bewail her father and her mother a month of days, afterwards thou shalt go in unto her, and know her, and she shall be thy wife" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_21_11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11-13</a>).<p>By a woman, is signified the church as to the spiritual affection for truth, or the spiritual affection for truth pertaining to the man of the church, but by a beautiful captive woman is signified the religion of the Gentiles in whom is the desire or affection for truth. By her being brought into the midst of the house, and there shaving her head, paring her nails, and afterwards putting the raiment of her captivity from off her, is signified being led into the interior or spiritual things of the church, and by means of them rejecting the evils and falsities of the natural and sensual man. The midst of the house signifies things interior, which are spiritual things; the hair of the head, that was to be shaved, signifies the falsities and evils of the natural man; the nails, that were to be pared, signify the falsities and evils of the sensual man; and the raiment of captivity signifies the falsity of the religion in which he who desires truth from affection is, as it were, held captive. The latter and the former things therefore he will reject, because they are in the natural and sensual man, as was said above. That she should bewail her father and mother a month of days, signifies that the evils and falsities of his religion should be buried in oblivion; that the man should afterwards go in unto her, and know her, and that she should be his wife, signifies that thus truth, which is the man (vir), should be conjoined with its affection, which is the wife (uxor).<p>No one can know why this statute was given, unless he understand, from the spiritual sense, what is signified by a woman taken captive from the enemy, what by the midst or inmost of the house, what by hair, nails, and the raiment of captivity, and unless he know something concerning the conjunction of truth and good, for on this conjunction are founded all the precepts in the Word concerning marriages. The church as to the affection for truth is also signified by the woman clothed with the sun, labouring to bring forth, before whom stood the dragon when she brought forth the man-child; and who afterwards fled into the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Rev. 12:1</a> to end). That the woman here signifies the church, and the man-child whom she brought forth, the doctrine of truth, will be seen in the explanation below.</p><p>[17] Since a woman signifies the church as to the affection for truth from good, or the affection for truth from good pertaining to the man of the church, also in the opposite sense a woman signifies the lust of falsity from evil; for most things in the Word have also opposite significations. This is also signified in the following passages, by woman and women.<p>Thus in Jeremiah:<p>"Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_17.htm">7:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_18.htm">18</a>).<p>What these prophecies involve, cannot be known, unless it be known what is signified by the cities of Judah, the streets of Jerusalem, the sons, the fathers, and the women, also what is signified by gathering wood, by kindling a fire, by kneading the dough, and what by cakes, by the queen of the heavens, and by drink-offerings; but when the significations of such things are known, and substituted in their place, then the spiritual sense involved in these prophecies results. The cities of Judah signify the doctrinals of the church; the streets of Jerusalem, the truths thereof; in the present case, falsities; sons denote those who are in truths of doctrine, in this case, those who are in falsities, who are said to gather wood when they procure for themselves falsities from evils. Fathers denote those who are in the goods of the church, in this case, those who are in evils, who are said to kindle a fire when they approve and excite from the love of evil. Women denote the affections for truth from good, in this case, the disorderly desires of falsity from evil; they are said to knead the dough, when they fabricate doctrine from these and according to them. To make cakes to the queen of the heavens, signifies to worship infernal evils of every kind, to make cakes denoting to worship from evils, and the queen of the heavens, denoting all evils in the aggregate; for the queen of heavens signifies the same as the host of the heavens. To pour out drink-offerings unto other gods signifies to worship from falsities, other gods denoting infernal falsities; for God, in a good sense, signifies proceeding Divine Truth, but other gods signify infernal falsities, which are falsities from evil.</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>"As for my people, their oppressors, little children, and women rule over them. O my people, thy leaders cause thee to err, and have blotted out the way of thy paths" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_12.htm">3:12</a>).<p>Oppressors, little children, and women, signify those who violate, are ignorant of, and pervert, truths. Oppressors mean those who violate truths; little children, those who are ignorant of them, and women, the lusts which pervert them. Thy leaders who cause to err, signify those who teach; to blot out the way of their paths, signifies so that truth which leads is not known.</p><p>[19] Again, in the same prophet:<p>"When the harvest withereth, they who break in pieces, the women shall come, and set it on fire; for it is a people of no understanding" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_11.htm">27:11</a>).<p>This is said concerning the vastated church. By the harvest withering, are signified the truths of good destroyed by evil loves; by the women who set it on fire, are signified the lusts of falsity, which altogether consume.</p><p>[20] So again:<p>"Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye confident sons (filii); in your ears perceive my speech, for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_32_9.htm">32:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_32_10.htm">10</a>).<p>By the women who are at ease, are meant the lusts of those who care not that the church is vastated. The confident sons signify the falsities of those who trust in [their] own intelligence; women and sons signify all those who are such in the church, whether men or women; by the vintage which shall fail, and by the gathering which shall not come, is signified, that the truth of the church shall be no more; for vintage and vine both signify the truth of the church, whence the meaning of "the gathering" thereof is evident.</p><p>[21] Again, in Ezekiel:<p>"A just man (vir), who hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled the wife of his companion, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_5.htm">18:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_6.htm">6</a>).<p>The man who has not eaten upon the mountains, is described as just, which signifies that his worship is not from infernal loves, for to sacrifice upon mountains and to eat of things sacrificed has this signification. Neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, signifies, that his worship is not from the falsities of doctrine, for idols signify those falsities, and the house of Israel signifies the perverted church where those falsities are. Neither hath defiled the wife of his companion, signifies, who does not adulterate the good of the church and of the Word. Neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, signifies, who does not defile truths by the lusts of falsity.</p><p>[22] So in Lamentations:<p>"The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children, so, that they became their food, in the breach of the daughter of my people" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_10.htm">4:10</a>).<p>These words signify the destruction of the truth and good of doctrine from the Word by means of falsities, and the appropriation of those falsities, and the consequent vastation of the church. By the pitiful women are signified the affections for falsity as if it were truth. By their having sodden their children, is signified the destruction of the truths and goods of doctrine from the Word by falsities; by their being meat for them, is signified the appropriation of falsities; and by the breach of the daughter of my people, is signified the vastation of the church. Women also signify evil desires in the Apocalypse (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_4.htm">14:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a>); concerning which see the explanation below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 555</h4><p>555. Verse 8. And they had hair as the hair of women, signifies that they seem to themselves to be also natural affections of truth. This is evident from the signification of "hair," as being the things of the natural man, and in particular the true knowledges [scientifica] there (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/66.htm">66</a>); and from the signification of "women," as being affections (of which presently). "Hair" signifies the things of the natural man because the "head" signifies the things of the spiritual man, and all things of the natural man invest all things of the spiritual man, as the hair invests the head; the head also corresponds to things spiritual, and the hair to things natural, thence also that is what they signify. It is from this correspondence that angels are seen with beautiful hair, and from the orderly arrangement, grace, and gloss of their locks it may be known how the natural man in them corresponds with the spiritual. Now as "women" signify affections, it can be seen that "they had hair as the hair of women" signifies that they seem to themselves to be natural affections of truth. That this is what is signified is evident also from the series; for "faces as men's faces" signify the appearance as if they were spiritual affections of truth; thence now it follows that "hair as the hair of women" signifies there seeming to be natural affection of truth; it is said immediately, too, of their teeth, that they were "as lion's teeth," and these signify the ultimates of the natural man in respect to knowledge and power. In the prophetic Word the terms "woman," and also "daughter" and "virgin" often occur; but it has heretofore been unknown what they signify. It is very evident that a woman, a daughter, or a virgin is not meant, since where these are mentioned the church is treated of; but what they signify can be seen from the connection of the subjects treated of in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[2] That "woman" signifies the church as regards the affection of truth, thus the affection of the truth of the church, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Jeremiah:<p>Wherefore commit ye evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, babe, and suckling, out of Jerusalem? <sup>1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>).<p>In the same:<p>I will scatter man and woman; I will scatter the old man and the lad; I will scatter the young man and the virgin (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_22.htm">Jeremiah 51:22</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>Slay to destruction the old man and the young man and the virgin and the infant and the women (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_9_6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>).<p>In Lamentations:<p>They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah; princes were hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders were not honored (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_11.htm">Lamentations 5:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_12.htm">12</a>).<p>In these passages "man and woman," "old man and babe," "youth and virgin," do not mean man, woman, old man, babe, youth, and virgin, but all things of the church; "man and woman" signify truth and its affection, "old man and babe" wisdom and innocence, "youth and virgin" the understanding of truth and the affection for good. That such is the signification is made evident from this that these chapters treat of the church and its desolation in respect to truth and good; therefore these terms signify such things as belong to the church. For the Word is inwardly spiritual, because it is Divine; but if man and woman, old man and babe, youth and virgin meant such persons, the Word would not be spiritual but natural; but it becomes spiritual when "man and woman" mean the church in respect to truth and its affection, "old man and babe" the church in respect to wisdom and innocence, and "young man and virgin" the church in respect to intelligence and its affection. Moreover, man is man because the church is in him, and where the church is, there is heaven. When, therefore, man as "old," "young," an "infant," a "male," also "woman" and "virgin" are mentioned, that with them pertaining to the church that corresponds in age, sex, inclination, affection, intelligence, and wisdom, is meant.</p><p>[3] That "woman" signifies the church in respect to the affection of truth, or the affection of the truth of the church, can be seen also from these words in Isaiah:<p>Then seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and we will clothe ourselves with our own raiment; only let thy name be called upon us; gather thou up our reproach (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>).<p>This treats of the end of the church, when there is no longer any truth, for these words precede:<p>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy strength in the war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>);<p>which signify that the understanding of truth will be destroyed by falsities, so that there will be no more resistance in combats; and it is added:<p>In that day shall the shoot of Jehovah be for splendor and glory (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>);<p>which signifies that truth will spring up anew in the church; for this is said of the Lord's coming. "Seven women shall take hold of one man" signifies that truth will be desired and sought from affection but will not be found; "man" signifying truth, "women" affections or longings for truth, and "seven" holiness. That instruction in genuine truths, and thus spiritual nourishment would not be found, is signified by saying "we will eat our own bread, and we will clothe ourselves with our own raiment;" "bread" signifying instruction and spiritual nourishment, and "raiment" truth clothing good; that truth only can be applied and by application conjoined is signified by "only let thy name be called upon us;" and as all esteem is from the spiritual affection of truth and conjunction therefrom, and otherwise there is no esteem, it is said, "gather thou up or take away our reproach."</p><p>[4] In Jeremiah:<p>Return, O virgin of Israel, return to thy cities. How long wilt thou go about? For Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall compass a man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_22.htm">22</a>).<p>This treats of the spiritual captivity in which the church was before the Lord's coming. The church is said to be in spiritual captivity when there is no truth, and yet truth is desired; in such captivity were the Gentiles with whom the church was established. "Return, O virgin of Israel, return to thy cities," signifies that they shall return to the truths of doctrine; "virgin of Israel" being the church, and "her cities" the truths of doctrine. "For Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man," signifies that a new church is to be established in which truth will be conjoined to its affection; "to create a new thing in the earth" meaning to establish that new thing; "woman" being the church in respect to the affection of truth, "man" truth, and "to compass" to be conjoined.</p><p>[5] In Isaiah:<p>As a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit Jehovah hath called thee, and a woman of youth when rejected, said thy God. For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great compassions will I gather thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_7.htm">7</a>).<p>Here, too, "a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit" means the church that is not in truths and yet is in the affection or longing for them, "woman" meaning the church, which is said to be "forsaken" when it is not in truths, and to be "afflicted in spirit" when in grief from the affection or longing for truths. "A woman of youth" means the Ancient Church, which was in truths from affection; and "one rejected" means the Jewish church, which was not in truths from any spiritual affection; that the church is to be established by the Lord, and delivered from spiritual captivity, is meant by "for a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great compassions will I gather thee."</p><p>[6] In Jeremiah:<p>Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear perceive the word of His mouth, that ye may teach your sons <sup>2</sup>wailing, and a woman her companion lamentation. For death hath come up through the windows, it hath come into our palaces, to cut off the babe from the street, the young man from the broad ways (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_20.htm">Jeremiah 9:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_21.htm">21</a>).<p>It was said to women that they should hear and perceive, because "women" signify the church from the affection and reception of truth; "sons whom the women should teach wailing," and the "companion whom a woman should teach lamentation," signify all who are of the church, "sons" signifying those who are in the truths of the church, "companion" they who are in the good of the church; "wailing and lamentation" signify because of the church vastated in respect to truths and goods; "death hath come up through the windows, it hath come into our palaces" signifies infernal falsity entering into the understanding, and thence into all things of thought and affection, "windows" signifying the understanding, and "palaces" all things of the thought and affection; "to cut off the babe from the street, and the young man from the broad ways," signifies the vastation of nascent truth and of truth born; the "babe in the street" meaning nascent truth, and "the young man in the broad ways" truth born.</p><p>[7] In Ezekiel:<p>Two women, the daughters of one mother, who committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth; the name of the elder was Oholah, and the name of her sister Oholibah; and they bare sons and daughter. Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_2.htm">Ezekiel 23:2-4</a>).<p>As "Samaria," the metropolis of the Israelites, signifies in the Word the spiritual church, and "Jerusalem," the metropolis of the Jews, the celestial church, each in respect to doctrine; so these are called "women;" and as these two churches act as one, they are called "daughters of one mother," "mother" also signifying the church, as do "Oholah and Oholibah," that is, "the tent or habitation of God," for this signifies heaven where Divine truth and Divine good are, and so, too, the church, for the church is the Lord's heaven on earth; "their committing whoredom in Egypt in their youth" signifies that they were then in no truths but in falsities, for in Egypt they had not the Word; that was given to them afterwards through Moses and the prophets, and it was thus that the church was instituted among them. "To commit whoredom in Egypt" signifies to falsify truths by knowledges of the natural man, and to falsify truths there means to turn holy things into magic, as the Egyptians did; "the sons and daughters whom they bore" signify the falsities and evils of the church.</p><p>[8] In Micah:<p>Ye draw off the robe from them that pass by securely, returning from war. The women of my people ye drive out from the house of their delights (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_2_8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_2_9.htm">9</a>).<p>"To draw off the robe from them that pass by securely, returning from war," signifies to deprive of truths all who are in truths, and who have fought against falsities; "who pass by securely" signifies all who are in truths; "returning from war" those who have been in temptations, and who have fought against falsities. "To drive out the women of my people from the house of their delights" signifies to destroy the affections of truth, and thus the pleasantnesses and felicities of heaven, "the women of my people" meaning the affections of truth, and "house of delights" the pleasantnesses and felicities of heaven, for these are the affections of good and truth.</p><p>[9] In Zechariah:<p>I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be captured and the house <sup>3</sup>plundered, and the women shall be ravished (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>).<p>"All nations" signify evils and falsities of every kind; "Jerusalem" signifies the church, "city" doctrine, "house" everything holy of the church, "women" the affections of truth, and "their being ravished" that truths will be perverted, and that thus the affections of truth will perish.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>In that day shall the lamentation in Jerusalem increase, and the land shall lament and every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their women apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their women apart; the family of the house of Levi apart, and their women apart; the family of the house of Simeon apart, and their women apart; all the families that are left, every family apart, and their women apart (<a href="../ae/430.htm">430</a>, <a href="../ae/431.htm">431</a>). "Jerusalem" signifies the church and its doctrine.</p><p>[11] In Matthew:<p>Then shall two be in the field, one shall be taken and the other left. Two shall be grinding at the mill, one shall be taken and the other left (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4334.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4334</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4335.htm">4335</a>.)</p><p>[12] In Moses:<p>I will break for you the staff of bread, that ten women may bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring back your bread by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_26_26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>).<p>This means, in the spiritual sense, that truth from good, which is spiritual nourishment, shall fail, "bread" signifying all spiritual food by which the man of the church is nourished, and "women" those of the church who are in the affection of truth. "Ten women shall bake bread in one oven" signifies that the truth which may be conjoined to good will be sought for but very little will be found; for "to bake" signifies to prepare and conjoin that it may serve for the use of life; "to bring back the bread by weight" signifies that it is scarce; and "to eat and not be satisfied" signifies because truth from good is so scanty and scarce as to yield hardly any nourishment to the soul.</p><p>[13] In Moses:<p>A man's garment shall not be upon a woman, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>).<p>"Man and his garment" signifies truth, and "woman and her garment" signifies the affection of truth. These in every man are as distinct as understanding and will are, or as thought which is of the understanding, and affection which is of the will are; and unless they were distinct, the sexes would be confounded, and there would be no marriage, for in marriage man is the truth which is of the thought, and woman is affection.<p>That man and woman were both so created that they may be two and yet one, is evident from the book of Genesis in which it is said of the creation of the two:<p>And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; <sup>4</sup>male and female created He them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_5_2.htm">5:2</a>).</p><p>[14] And afterwards:<p>The man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; for this she shall be called wife, because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh (<a href="../hh/7.htm">Heaven and Hell 7-12</a>, <a href="../hh/51.htm">51-58</a>). "Male" signifies here, as above, the truth which is of the understanding, and "female" the good which is of the will; the wife is said to be "bone of man's bones, and flesh of his flesh," to signify that good, which is the wife, is from truth, which is the man, "bone" signifying truth before it is vivified, that is, conjoined to good, such as is the truth of the memory with man; and because all good is formed from truths it is said, "because she was taken out of man." That "the man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife" signifies that truth must be of good, and that thus both must become one good; this is signified by "they shall be one flesh," "flesh" signifying good, and also a human being. But the things here said cannot enter the understanding of man, except with few, unless it is known that the first two chapters of Genesis treat of the new creation, that is, of the regeneration of the men of the church, the first chapter of their regeneration, the second of their intelligence and wisdom; and "male and female," or "man and wife," mean in the spiritual sense the conjunction of truth and good, which is called the heavenly marriage, into which marriage man comes when he is regenerated and becomes a church; and man has been regenerated and has become a church when he is in good and in truths therefrom, which is meant by "the man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be as one flesh." (But a still clearer idea of these things may be had from what is said in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, On Good and Truth, n. <a href="../njhd/11.htm">11-19</a>; On the Will and Understanding, n. <a href="../njhd/28.htm">28-33</a>; On Regeneration, n <a href="../njhd/173.htm">173-182</a>; also respecting the good from which are truths, n. <a href="../njhd/24.htm">24</a>.)</p><p>[15] Because "man and woman" signify the conjunction of truth and good:<p>When Moses saw that the sons of Israel took to themselves the female captives of the Midianites, their enemies, he said that they should kill every woman that had known man by lying with a male; but that they should keep alive the women that had not known man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_17.htm">Numbers 31:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_18.htm">18</a>).<p>These things were commanded because a "woman not conjoined to a man" signified the church in respect to the affection for truth or for conjunction with truth; but "a woman conjoined to a man of Midian" signified good adulterated; for the Midianites represented, and thence signified, truth that is not truth because it is not from good, thus is falsity. This was why the women who had known man were to be killed, but those who had not known man were to be kept alive. "The women of Midian" signified the defilement of good by falsities, and thus good adulterated and profaned, which is filthy adultery, as is evident from what is related respecting "the whoredom of the sons of Israel with the women of the Midianites" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>).</p><p>[16] Whoever does not know that "woman" signifies the spiritual affection of truth, also that the evils and falsities that everyone has are in the natural man, and none of them in the spiritual man, cannot know what is signified by the following respecting a woman captive in Moses:<p>If thou shalt see in captivity a woman beautiful in form of the enemy, and hast a desire unto her for a wife, thou shalt bring her into the midst of thy house; where she shall shave her head and pare her nails; then she shall put away the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall weep for her father and her mother a month of days, and after that thou shalt go in unto her and know her, and she shall be thy wife (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_21_11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11-13</a>).<p>A "woman" signifies the church in respect to the spiritual affection of truth, or the spiritual affection of truth which a man of the church has, but "a woman captive beautiful in form" signifies the religious principles with the Gentiles in whom is a longing or affection for truth; that "she is to be brought into the midst of the house, and there is to shave her head, pare her nails, and afterwards put away the raiment of her captivity" signifies that she should be led into the interior or spiritual things of the church, and by means of them reject the evils and falsities of the natural and sensual man; "the midst of the house" signifies things interior which are spiritual; "the hair of the head which must be shaved" signifies the falsities and evils of the natural man; "the nails which must be pared," signify the falsities and evils of the sensual man; and "the raiment of captivity" signifies the falsity of religion in which one who from affection longs for truth is held as it were captive; all these, therefore, must be rejected because they are in the natural and sensual man, as has been said above; that she shall "weep for her father and her mother a month of days" signifies that the evils and falsities of one's religion must be consigned to oblivion; "after that the man should go in unto her and know her, and she should be his wife," signifies that thus truth, which is the "man," can be conjoined with its affection, which is the "wife." Why this statute was given no one can know unless he knows from the spiritual sense what is signified by "a woman taken captive from the enemy," by "the midst or inmost of the house," by "hair," "nails," and "the raiment of captivity," and unless he knows something about the conjunction of truth and good, for on this conjunction all the precepts in the Word concerning marriages are founded. The church in respect to the affection of truth is signified also by:<p>The woman encompassed with the sun, and in labor, before whom the dragon stood when she should bring forth a man child; and who afterwards fled into the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>, et seq.).<p>Here the "woman" signifies the church, and the "man child" whom she brought forth, the doctrine of truth, as will be seen in the explanation further on.</p><p>[17] As "woman" signifies the church in respect to the affection of truth from good, or the affection of truth from good of the man of the church, so in the contrary sense a "woman" signifies the cupidity of falsity from evil; for most things in the Word have also an opposite signification. A "woman" (and women) signify this in the following passages. In Jeremiah:<p>Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The sons gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of the heavens, and also to pour out libations unto other gods (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_18.htm">18</a>)<p>What this prophecy involves cannot be known unless it is known what "the cities of Judah," "the streets of Jerusalem," what the "sons," "fathers," and "women" signify, also what "gathering wood," "kindling a fire," "kneading the dough," "cakes," "the queen of the heavens," and "libations" signify. But when it is known what these signify, and the signification is taken in place of the things named, there results therefrom the spiritual meaning that is involved in this prophecy. "The cities of Judah" signify the doctrinals of the church; "the streets of Jerusalem" the truths of these, but here falsities; "sons" mean those who are in the truths of doctrine, but here those who are in falsities, who are said "to gather wood" when they acquire for themselves falsities from evils; "fathers" mean those who are in the goods of the church, but here those who are in evils, who are said "to kindle a fire" when from the love of evil they favor and excite evils; "women" mean the affections of truth from good, but here the cupidities of falsity from evil; these are said "to knead the dough" when from falsities and according to them they frame doctrine; "to make cakes to the queen of the heavens" signifies to worship infernal evils of every kind, "to make cakes" meaning to worship from evils, and "the queen of the heavens" meaning all evils in the complex, for "the queen of the heavens" has a similar signification as "the host of the heavens;" "to pour out libations unto other gods" signifies to worship from falsities, "other gods" meaning infernal falsities; for "God" signifies, in a good sense, Divine truth proceeding, but "other gods" signify infernal falsities, which are falsities from evil.</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>As for My people, babes are their oppressors, and women rule over it. <sup>5</sup>O My people, thy leaders cause thee to err, and have blotted out the way of thy paths (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>).<p>"Oppressors," "babes," and "women," signify those who violate, are ignorant of, and pervert truths, "oppressors" meaning those who violate truths; "babes" those who are ignorant of them, and "women" the cupidities that pervert them; "leaders that cause thee to err" signify those who teach; "to blot out the way of thy paths" signifies that the truth which leads is not known.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>When the harvest withereth, breaking in pieces, the women coming shall set it on fire; for this is a people of no intelligence (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_11.htm">Isaiah 27:11</a>).<p>This is said of the church vastated; "the harvest withering" signifies the truths of good destroyed by evil loves; "the women who set it on fire" signify the cupidities of falsity which altogether consume.</p><p>[20] In the same:<p>Rise up, ye women that are at ease, hear my voice; ye confident sons <sup>6</sup>give ear to my speech; the vintage shall be consumed, the ingathering shall not come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_32_9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_32_10.htm">10</a>).<p>"Women that are at ease" signify the cupidities of those who are wholly unconcerned about the vastation of the church; "the confident sons" signify the falsities of those who trust in self-intelligence; "women and sons" signify all in the church who are such, whether men or women; "the vintage that shall be consumed, and the ingathering that shall not come" signify that there shall no longer be any truth of the church, for "vintage" has a similar signification as "wine," namely, the truth of the church; and this makes evident what is signified by its "ingathering."</p><p>[21] In Ezekiel:<p>But if a man be just, and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled the wife of his companion, neither come near to a menstruous woman (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_6.htm">6</a>).<p>"The just man" is described as one "who hath not eaten upon the mountains," which signifies whose worship is not from infernal loves, for this is the signification of "sacrificing upon mountains," and "eating of the sacrifices;" "who hath not lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel" signifies whose worship is not from the falsities of doctrine, for "idols" signify the falsities of doctrine, and "the house of Israel" means the perverted church in which such falsities are; "who hath not defiled the wife of his companion" signifies who does not adulterate the good of the church and of the Word; "who cometh not near to a menstruous woman" signifies who does not defile truths by the cupidities of falsity.</p><p>[22] In Lamentations:<p>The hands of the compassionate women have sodden their own children that they might become food for them, in the breach of the daughter of My people (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>).<p>This signifies the destruction by falsities of the truth and good of doctrine from the Word, and the appropriation of the falsities, with the consequent vastation of the church. "The compassionate women" signify the affections of falsity as if it were truth; "their having sodden children" signifies to destroy by falsities the truths and goods of doctrine from the Word; "to become food for them" signifies to appropriate falsities; and "the breach of the daughter of my people" signifies the vastation of the church.

[Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_9_8" target=_top>8</a>.] "Et habebant capillos sicut capillos mulierum." - Quod significet quod etiam appareant sibi affectiones veri naturales, constat ex significatione "capillorum", quod sint illa quae naturalis hominis sunt, et in specie vera scientifica ibi (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66" target=_top>66</a>); et ex significatione "mulierum", quod sint affectiones (de qua sequitur). <p>Quod "capilli" significent illa quae naturalis hominis sunt, est quia "caput" significat illa quae spiritualis hominis sunt, ac omnia naturalis hominis investiunt omnia spiritualis hominis, sicut capilli caput; etiam caput correspondet spiritualibus, et capilli correspondent naturalibus, inde etiam illa significant. Ex correspondentia illa est quod angeli appareant pulchre comati, et quod secundum comarum ordinatam pendentiam, decorem et nitorem, sciatur qualis correspondentia est naturalis hominis cum spirituali apud illos. Nunc quia "mulieres" significant affectiones, constare potest quod per quod "haberent capillos sicut capillos mulierum" significetur quod appareant sibi sicut affectiones [veri] naturales: quod haec significentur, etiam ex serie patet, nam per "facies sicut facies hominum" significatur apparentia sicut essent spirituales affectiones veri; inde nunc sequitur quod per "capillos sicut capillos mulierum" significetur apparentia sicut essent naturales affectiones veri; mox etiam dicitur de dentibus, quod illi essent "sicut dentes leonum", et per illos significantur ultima naturalis hominis quoad scientiam et quoad potentiam. In Verbo Prophetico multoties dicitur "mulier", et quoque "filia" et "virgo"; sed hactenus ignotum fuit quid per illas significatur; quod non mulier, nec filia et virgo intelligantur, clare patet, nam nominantur ubi agitur de ecclesia; quid autem per illa significatur, videri potest ex serie rerum de quibus agitur, in sensu spirituali.<p>[2] Quod per "mulierem" significetur ecclesia quoad affectionem veri, et inde affectio veri ecclesiae, constare potest a sequentibus locis in Verbo:<p>- Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Quare facitis malum.... contra amimas vestras, ad exscindendum vobis virum et mulierem, infantem et lactentem, e medio <sup>1</sup></p><p>Jehudae?"

Verbum enim interius est spirituale, quia est Divinum; quare si per "virum et mulierem", "senem et infantem", "juvenem et virginem", intelligerentur illi, foret Verbum naturale et non spirituale; at tunc fit spirituale cum per "virum et mulierem" significatur ecclesia quoad verum et ejus affectionem, per "senem et infantem" ecclesia quoad sapientiam et innocentiam, ac per "juvenem et virginem" ecclesia quoad intelligentiam et ejus affectionem.

Per quod "septem mulieres apprehendent unum virum" significatur quod ex affectione desideraturi et quaesituri sint verum, sed non inventuri; per "virum" significatur verum, per "mulieres" affectiones seu desideria ad verum, et per "septem" sanctum: quod non inventuri instructionem in genuinis veris et sic nutritionem spiritualem, significatur per quod dicent "Panem nostrum comedemus, et veste nostra induemus nos"; "panis" significat instructionem et nutritionem spiritualem, et "vestis" verum induens bonum; quod modo sit verum quod applicari possit, et per applicationem conjungi, significatur per "tantum modo nominetur nomen tuum super nos": et quia omne decus est ex affectione spirituali veri et inde conjunctione, et alioqui non decus, ideo dicitur "Collige" seu tolle "opprobrium nostrum."<p>[4] Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Revertere, virgo Israel, revertere ad urbes tuas [has] ; quousque circumvagaberis.... ? quia creavit Jehovah novum in terra, femina circumdabit virum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_21" target=_top>31:21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_22" target=_top>22</a>):<p>agitur hic de captivitate spirituali, in qua fuit ecclesia ante Domini adventum. Ecclesia dicitur in captivitate spirituali esse quando non verum et usque desideratur; in tali captivitate fuerunt gentes apud quas ecclesia instaurata est. "Revertere, virgo Israel, revertere ad urbes tuas", significat quod redituri sint ad vera doctrinae; "virgo Israel" est ecclesia, et "urbes ejus" sunt vera doctrinae: "quia creavit Jehovah novum in terra, femina circumdabit virum", significat quod instauranda sit nova ecclesia, in qua verum conjungetur suae affectioni; "creare novum in terra" est instaurare novum illud, "femina" est ecclesia quoad affectionem veri, "vir" est verum, et "circumdare" est conjungi.<p>[5] Apud Esaiam,<p>"Quasi mulierem desertam et afflictam spiritu vocavit te Jehovah, et mulierem juventutis, cum repudiata, dixit Deus tuus; momento parvo deserui te, sed cum miserationibus magnis recolligam te" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_6" target=_top>54:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_7" target=_top>7</a>):<p>etiam hic per "mulierem desertam et afflictam spiritu" intelligitur ecclesia quae non in veris, sed usque in affectione seu desiderio ad illa; "mulier" est ecclesia, quae "deserta" dicitur cum non in veris, et "afflicta spiritu" cum in dolore ex affectione seu desiderio ad vera: per "mulierem juventutis" intelligitur Ecclesia Antiqua, quae fuit in veris ex affectione; et per "repudiatam" intelligitur Ecclesia Judaica, quae non in veris ex aliqua affectione spirituali: quod instauranda sit a Domino, et liberanda a captivitate spirituali, intelligitur per "Momento parvo deserui te, sed cum miserationibus magnis recolligam te."<p>[6] Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Audite, mulieres, verbum Jehovae, et percipiat auris vestra verbum oris Ipsius, ut doceatis <sup>3</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_9_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_9_21" target=_top>21</a>]):<p>quod dicatur ad "mulieres" quod audirent et perciperent, est quia per illas significatur ecclesia ex affectione et receptione veri: per " <sup>4</sup></p><p>filios" quos mulieres docerent luctum, et per "sociam" quam mulier doceret lamentationem, significantur omnes qui ab ecclesia; per " <sup>5</sup></p><p>filios" qui in veris ecclesiae, per "sociam" quae in bono ejus, "luctus" et "lamentatio" significat propter vastatam ecclesiam quoad vera et quoad bonum: "mors ascendit per fenestras, venit in palatia nostra", significat quod falsum infernale intraverit in intellectum et inde in omnia cogitationiS et affectionis; "fenestrae" significant intellectum, et "palatia" omnia cogitationis et affectionis: "ad exscindendum infantem e platea et juvenem e vicis", significat vastationem veri nascentis et veri nati; "infans in platea" est verum nascens, et "juvenis in vicis" est verum natum.<p>[7] Apud Ezechielem,<p>"Duae mulieres filiae unius matris, quae scortatae sunt in Aegypto, in adolescentia sua scortatae sunt;.... nomen majoris natu Ohola, et nomen sororis ejus Oholiba, .... et pepererunt filios et filias. ....

non enim in Aegypto fuit illis Verbum; hoc per Mosen et prophetas postea illis datum est, et sic instituta est apud illos ecclesia: "scortari in Aegypto" significat falsificare vera per scientifica quae naturalis hominis;
