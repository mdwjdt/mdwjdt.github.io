<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 827</h4><p>827. Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast. That this signifies an ordinance appointed that such things should be fully taught and believed by all in the church, is evident from the signification of them who dwell on the earth, as denoting all who belong to the church (see above, n. <a href="../ae/826.htm">826</a>). And from the signification of the image made to the beast, as denoting the doctrine of faith separated from good works, and the worship therefrom; and all this confirmed from the literal sense of the Word by means of reasonings from the natural man. Hence by making that image is signified to make a statute, or to ordain that it shall be altogether so taught and believed; as also has been done in the churches where the doctrine of faith separate has been received.<p>The reason why the image signifies these things is, that all spiritual things may be exhibited by means of images, also by idols, in the spiritual world; and the particulars of doctrine may be presented by them in effigy, which I have also seen done. Hence it is that images and idols have such significations in the Word. That idols signify falsities of doctrine, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/587.htm">587</a>, <a href="../ae/650.htm">650</a>, <a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>, <a href="../ae/780.htm">780</a>). Hence, then, by saying to them that dwell upon the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, is signified an ordinance appointed that such things should be fully taught and believed by all in the church.<p>Amongst those who belonged to the Ancient Churches images were made representative of their doctrine, and of the worship therefrom. The sons of Israel, however, on account of their propensity to idolatry, were forbidden to make them. This is evident from the Word.</p><p>[2] In order, therefore, that it may be known that images signify such things, the following passages from the Word shall be adduced by way of confirmation. Thus in Moses:<p>"Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor worship them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_5.htm">5</a>).<p>"Ye shall not make to you idols, nor sculptured thing, nor raise up a statue to you, nor shall ye give the stone of an image in your land to bow yourselves down to them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_26_1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>).<p>"Lest ye make to you a sculptured image of any likeness, the figure of a male or female, the figure of any beast which is in the earth, the figure of any bird of wing which flieth under heaven, the figure of any reptile in the earth, the figure of any fish which is in the waters under the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_4_16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16-18</a>).<p>The reason why it was forbidden the sons of Israel to make idols, sculptured things, images, and figures of anything in the heavens, in the earth, and in the waters was, because the Ancient Churches, which were before the Israelitish Church, were representative churches; and because the sons of Jacob were altogether external men; and external men at that time, when all worship was representative, were prone to idolatries, therefore to the worship of such things as appeared before their eyes. Now whereas the Ancient Churches were representative, therefore the men of those churches made to themselves sculptured things and images of various kinds, which represented and thence signified things heavenly; and the ancients were delighted with them on account of their signification. Therefore when they looked upon those things they were reminded of the heavenly things which they represented. And because they belonged to their religion, they made use of them in worship. Hence they had groves and high places, and also sculptured, molten, and painted figures, which they placed either in groves, or upon mountains, or in temples, or in their houses. Hence in Egypt, where the science of representations, which is the same as the science of correspondences, flourished, they had images, idols, and sculptured things; this also was the origin of their hieroglyphics. The case was the same with various other nations. But when the men of those churches, from being internal became external, then the celestial and spiritual things which were represented and thence signified, remained as traditions with their priests and wise men, who were called magi and diviners. Hence the common people, by reason of the religious principle which their fathers saw in those things, began to worship them, and to call them their gods. Now because the sons of Jacob were external men more than all others, and consequently prone to idolatries, and also to magic, therefore they were strictly forbidden to make to themselves sculptured things, images, and figures of the likeness of anything existing in the heavens, upon the earth, and in the sea; because everything in the world is representative, as fowls, beasts, fishes, reptiles. For so far as they worshipped them idolatrously, so far they did not acknowledge Jehovah. But still, because the church with them also was representative, the Tabernacle was built, in which representatives were placed, chiefly of celestial things, as the table of show-bread, the golden altar of incense, the lampstand with the lamps, the ark with the mercy-seat, and the cherubs above it, the altar not far from the door of the Tabernacle, upon which was the sacred fire. And afterwards the Temple was built, in which also all things were representative, as the paintings therein, the lavers on the outside, the brazen sea supported by oxen, also the columns and porticos, with the vessels of gold, all which it was allowed them to worship as holy, on condition that they acknowledged the Tabernacle, and afterwards the Temple, for the dwelling-place of Jehovah. These things were granted them to prevent their turning aside to idolatry and magic, which then existed in the various nations in Asia; as in Egypt, Syria, Assyria, Babylon, Tyre and Sidon, Arabia, Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, and especially in and about the land of Canaan.</p><p>[3] From this it is evident why it is that idols, in the Word, signify the falsities of religion; and images, doctrinals.<p>That such things existed among the various nations in the countries of Asia, is evident from the gods of Laban the Syrian, which Rachel the wife of Jacob took away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_31_19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_31_20.htm">20</a>); from the calves and other idols in Egypt; from the hieroglyphics there engraved and painted in temples, and upon obelisks, and walls; from Dagon the idol of the Philistines in Ekron, from the idols made by Solomon, and afterwards by the kings in the Temple of Jerusalem, and in Samaria; from the altars, statues, images, and groves, amongst the nations of the land, which the children of Israel were commanded to destroy, as is evident from various passages in the Word.</p><p>[4] It was also from the science of correspondences and representations<p>That the priests and diviners of the Philistines advised them to make golden images of the hemorrhoids and mice which laid waste the land, and to place them near the ark, which they sent back upon a new cart drawn by kine, that so they might give glory to the God of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Sam. 5:1</a> and following verses).<p>For at that time their priests and diviners knew what all those things represented; and that the images of the hemorrhoids and mice signified the falsities of their religion, which, as gifts, would be rendered propitiatory, by making them of gold.</p><p>[5] Doctrinals are also signified by images in the following passages. Thus in Ezekiel:<p>"They shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be an abomination, because they have transposed the gracefulness of their adorning for pride, and made thereof images of their abominations and detestations; therefore I have given it to them for an abomination" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_20.htm">7:20</a>).<p>The subject there treated of is concerning the devastation of the church by falsities and evils, which is there meant by the sword, pestilence, and famine (verse 15), which shall consume them. By the silver which they shall cast into the streets, and by the gold which shall be for an abomination, is signified the truth of the church and the good thereof turned into falsity and evil. To cast them into the streets, signifies to disperse them, and to be for an abomination signifies to be turned into infernal evil. For this is to be turned to abomination. Their transposing the gracefulness of their adorning for pride, and making thereof images of their abominations and detestations, signifies, that, they filled the whole church and the doctrine thereof, and all things which are contained therein, with things profane; the gracefulness of their adorning signifying the church and its doctrine; and images of abominations and detestations signifying all things pertaining thereto, thus its doctrinals, which are goods and truths profaned. Abominations are goods profaned; and detestations, truths profaned.</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>"Thou hast taken the vessels of thy adorning, of my gold and of my silver which I had given thee, and hast made the images of a male, with which thou hast committed whoredom" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_17.htm">16:17</a>).<p>These things are said of the abominations of Jerusalem, by which are meant the adulterations of the good and truth of doctrine from the Word. The vessels of adorning of gold and silver, signify the knowledges of good and truth from the Word. To make images of a male, signifies to make doctrinals from falsities appear as if they were from truths. And to commit whoredom with them, signifies the falsification of them.</p><p>[7] Again:<p>Aholibah committed whoredom in Egypt, "she loved the sons of Ashur; she added to her whoredoms when she saw men painted upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans painted with vermilion, she doated upon them at the beholding of her eyes" (<a href="../ae/587.htm">587</a>, <a href="../ae/650.htm">650</a>, <a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>, <a href="../ae/780.htm">780</a>), where other passages from the Word are adduced and explained. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 827</h4><p>827. Saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast, signifies an established decree that all in the church should teach and believe nothing whatever except these things. This is evident from the signification of "them that dwell on the earth," as being all who belong to the church (See just above, n. <a href="../ae/826.htm">826</a>; also from the signification of "the image of the beast," as being the doctrine of faith separated from good works, and worship therefrom confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word by means of reasonings from the natural man; consequently "to make that image" signifies to make a decree or to determine that they should teach and believe only in this way; also that this has been done in the churches where the doctrine of faith separate has been accepted. This is the signification of the "image," because in the spiritual world all spiritual things may be exhibited by means of images, also by means of idols; and by these the particulars of doctrine may be portrayed, which I have also seen done. This is why images and idols have this signification in the Word. That idols signify the falsities of doctrine may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/587.htm">587</a>, <a href="../ae/650.htm">650</a>, <a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>, <a href="../ae/780.htm">780</a>). So here "saying to them that dwell upon the earth that they should make an image to the beast" signifies an established decree that all in the church should teach and believe nothing whatever except these things. With those who belonged to the ancient churches images were made representative of their doctrine and the worship therefrom; but the sons of Israel, on account of the proclivity of their mind to idolatrous worship, were forbidden to make them, as is evident from the Word.</p><p>[2] That it may be known that images have this signification I will cite in confirmation the following passages from the Word. In Moses:<p>Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any image of that which is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not bow thyself down to them nor worship them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_5.htm">5</a>).<p>Ye shall make no idols to you, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image or a pillar, neither shall ye place the stone of an image in your land to bow yourselves down to it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_26_1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>).<p>Lest ye make to you a graven image, the image of any likeness, the figure of male or female, the figure of any beast that is on the earth, the figure of any winged bird that flieth under heaven, the figure of anything that creepeth on the ground, the figure of any fish that is in the waters under the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_4_16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16-18</a>).<p>The sons of Israel were forbidden to make idols, graven images, and forms or figures of anything in the heavens, on the earth, or in the waters, because the ancient churches which were before the Israelitish Church were representative churches, also because the sons of Jacob were wholly external men, and external men at that time, when all worship was representative, were prone to idolatries, thus to the worship of such things as appeared before their eyes. But as the ancient churches were representative churches, the men of those churches made to themselves graven images and forms of various things which represented and thence signified things heavenly; and the ancients took delight in these on account of their signification, for when they looked upon them they were reminded of the heavenly things they represented; and as these belonged to their religion, therefore they worshiped the images. This is why they had groves and high places, and also sculptured, molten, and painted figures, which were set up either in groves or upon mountains, or in temples, or in their houses. So in Egypt, where the science of representations, which is the same as the science of correspondences, flourished, there were images, idols, and graven images, as also hieroglyphics; and other nations had the like. But when the men of those churches from being internal became external, then the celestial and spiritual things which were represented and thence signified remained as traditions with their priests and wise men, who were called magi and diviners; consequently the common people, because of the religious principle which their fathers saw in these things, began to worship them and to call them their gods. Now as the sons of Jacob were more external men than the others, and thence more prone to idolatries and also to magic, they were strictly forbidden to make to themselves graven images, images and figures of the likeness of anything existing in the heavens, on the earth, or in the sea, because all things that are in the world are representative, as flying things, beasts, fishes, and creeping things, for so far as they worshiped these idolatrously, so far they did not acknowledge Jehovah. And yet, since the church was representative with them also, the tabernacle was built, in which were placed the chief representatives of heavenly things, as the table on which were the loaves, the golden altar on which incense was offered, the lampstand with the lamps, the ark with the mercy-seat. and the cherubim above it, and the altar not far from the door of the tabernacle, on which was the sacred fire; and afterwards the temple was built, in which also all things were representative, as the painting therein, the lavers outside of it, the brazen sea under which were the oxen supporting it, likewise the pillars and porticos, with the vessels of gold, all of which they were permitted to worship as holy, provided they acknowledged the tabernacle, and afterwards the temple, as the dwelling-place of Jehovah. This was granted them to prevent their turning aside to idolatry and magic, which then existed with various nations in Asia; as Egypt, Syria, Assyria, Babylon, Tyre and Sidon, Arabia, Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, and especially in and about the land of Canaan.</p><p>[3] From this it is clear why "idols" signify in the Word the falsities of religion, and "images" doctrinals. That such things existed with various nations in the countries of Asia is made evident by the gods of Laban the Syrian that Rachel the wife of Jacob carried off (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_31_19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_31_20.htm">20</a>); by the calves and other idols in Egypt; by the hieroglyphics there engraved and painted in temples, and upon obelisks and walls; by Dagon the idol of the Philistines in Ekron; by the idols made by Solomon, and afterwards by the kings in the temple of Jerusalem and in Samaria; and by the altars, pillars, images, and groves, among the nations of the land, which the sons of Israel were commanded to destroy, as is evident from various passages in the Word.</p><p>[4] Moreover, it was from the science of correspondences and representations:<p>That the priests and diviners of the Philistines persuaded them to make golden images of the emerods and mice that had laid waste the land, and to place them beside the ark, which they sent back upon a new cart drawn by kine, and that they should thus give glory to the God of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_6_1.htm">1 Samuel 6</a> seq.).<p>For at that time their priests and diviners knew what all these things represented; and that the images of the emerods and mice signified the falsities of their religion, which might be atoned for by these as gifts made of gold.</p><p>[5] Doctrinals are also signified by "images" in the following passages. <p>In Ezekiel:<p>They shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be an abomination, in that they have turned the gracefulness of their adornment into pride, and have made thereof images of their abominations and their detestable things; therefore I have made it unto them for an abomination (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_20.htm">20</a>).<p>This treats of the devastation of the church by falsities and evils, which is here meant by "the sword, pestilence, and famine" (verse 15), that were to consume them. The "silver that they shall cast into the streets," and the "gold that shall be for an abomination," signify the truth of the church and its good turned into falsity and evil; "to cast these into the streets" signifies to scatter them, and "to be for an abomination" signifies to be turned into infernal evil, for this is to be for an abomination. "They have turned the gracefulness of their adornment into pride, and have made thereof images of their abominations and their detestable things," signifies that they filled the whole church and its doctrine, and all things that are contained in it, with things profane; "the gracefulness of the adornment" signifying the church and its doctrine; and "images of abominations and of detestable things" signifying all things of it, thus doctrinals, the goods and truths of which have been profaned; "abominations" are goods profaned, and "detestable things" truths profaned.</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>Thou didst take the vessels of thy adornment, of my gold and of my silver which I had given to thee, and madest for thee the images of a male, with which thou couldst commit whoredom (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>).<p>This is said of "the abominations of Jerusalem," which mean the adulterations of the truth and good of doctrine from the Word; "vessels of adornment of gold and silver" signifying the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; "to make of them images of a male" signifying to make doctrinals from falsities to appear as if from truths; and "to commit whoredom with them" signifying the falsification of them.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>Oholibah committed whoredom in Egypt, she loved the sons of Assyria; she added to her whoredoms; when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, at the sight of her eyes she loved them (<a href="../ae/587.htm">587</a>, <a href="../ae/650.htm">650</a>, <a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>, <a href="../ae/780.htm">780</a>, where other passages from the Word have been cited and explained.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 827 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>827. "Dicens habitantibus super terra facere imaginem bestiae." Quod significet ordinationem statutam quod prorsus talia docerentur et crederentur ab omnibus in ecclesia, constat ex significatione "habitantium super terra", quod sint omnes qui ab ecclesia (ut mox supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_826" target=_top>826</a>); et ex significatione "imaginis bestiae", quod sit doctrina fidei separatae a bonis operibus et inde cultus, confirmata ex sensu litterae Verbi per ratiocinia ex naturali homine; inde per "facere illam imaginem" significatur facere statutum seu ordinare quod prorsus ita doceatur et credatur; ut quoque factum est in ecclesiis ubi doctrina fidei separatae recepta est. <p>Quod "imago" illa significet, est quia omnia spiritualia sisti possint per imagines, tum per idola in mundo spirituali, et per illa effigiari singula doctrinae, quod etiam factum vidi; inde est quod "imagines" et "idola" in Verbo talia significent; quod "idola" significent falsa doctrinae, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_587" target=_top>587</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_650" target=_top>650</a> [b] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_654" target=_top>654</a> [h] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_780" target=_top>780</a> [a]): inde nunc per "dicere habitantibus super terra facere imaginem bestiae", significatur ordinatio statuta ut ab omnibus in ecclesia prorsus talia docerentur et crederentur. Quod apud illos qui ab Ecclesiis Antiquis fuerunt imagines repraesentativae doctrinae eorum et inde cultus factae sint, at quod filiis Israelis, propter propensionem animi eorum ad cultum idololatricum, illas facere prohibitum fuerit, constat ex Verbo.<p>[2] Ut itaque sciatur quod "imagines" talia significent, velim ad confirmationem sequentia loca e Verbo adducere: Apud Mosen,<p>"Non facies tibi sculptile, aut ullam imaginem quae in caelis desuper, et quae in terris infra, et quae in aquis sub terra; non incurvabis te illis, et non coles illa" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_20_4" target=_top>Exodus 20:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_20_5" target=_top>5</a>);<p>"Non facietis vobis idola, nec sculptile aut statuam erigetis vobis, nec lapidem imaginis dabitis in terra vestra ad incurvandum vos <sup>1</sup></p><p>illis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_26_1" target=_top>Leviticus 26:1</a>);<p>"Ne faciatis vobis sculptile imaginis ullius similitudinis, figuram maris aut feminae, figuram ullius bestiae quae in terra, figuram ullius avis alae quae volat sub caelo, figuram ullius reptilis in terra, figuram ullius piscis qui in aquis sub terra" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_4_16-18" target=_top>Deuteronomius 4:16-18</a>):<p>quod filiis Israelis prohibitum fuerit idola, sculptilia, imagines et figuras ullius rei in caelis, in terra, et in aquis facere, erat, quia Ecclesiae Antiquae, quae fuerunt ante Ecclesiam Israeliticam, ecclesiae repraesentativae fuerunt, et quia filii Jacobi prorsus externi homines fuerunt, et externi homines eo tempore, quando omnis cultus repraesentativus fuit, proni ad idololatrias erant, ita ad cultum talium quae coram oculis apparebant. Nunc quia Antiquae Ecclesiae repraesentativae fuerunt, ideo homines istarum ecclesiarum fecerunt sibi sculptilia et imagines variarum rerum, quae repraesentabant et inde significabant caelestia; et antiqui delectabantur illis ex eo quod significarent talia; quare cum illa inspectabant, recordabantur caelestium quae repraesentabant, et quia haec religionis illorum fuerunt, illa colebant; inde erant illis luci, erant excelsa, erant figurae sculptae, fusae et pictae, positae vel in lucis, vel super montibus, vel in templis, vel in domibus eorum. Inde in Aegypto, ubi scientia repraesentationum, quae eadem est cum scientia correspondentiarum, floruit, fuerunt imagines, idola et sculptilia, tum hieroglyphica; similiter apud varias gentes. Sed quando homines ecclesiarum illarum ab internis facti sunt externi, tunc caelestia et spiritualia, quae repraesentabantur et inde significabantur, remanserunt sicut traditiones apud illorum sacerdotes et sapientes, qui vocati sunt magi et harioli; inde vulgus propter religiosum, quod patres illorum in illis viderunt, coepit colere illa, et <sup>2</sup></p><p>vocare suos deos. Nunc quia filii Jacobi prae ceteris externi homines fuerunt, et inde proni ad idololatrica, et quoque ad magica, ideo tam severe prohibitum fuit illis sibi facere sculptilia, imagines et figuras ullius similitudinis rerum existentium in caelis, super terra, et in mari; quia omnia quae in mundo sunt, repraesentativa sunt, sicut volatilia, bestiae, pisces, reptilia; nam quantum illa idololatrice colebant, tantum non agnoscebant Jehovam; sed usque quia etiam apud illos repraesentativa ecclesia fuit, aedificatum est Tabernaculum, in quo repraesentativa caelestium praecipua posita fuerunt, sicut mensa super qua panes, altare aureum super quo suffiebatur, candelabrum cum lucernis, arca cum propitiatorio et cum cherubis desuper, altare non procul ab ostio tabernaculi, super quo ignis sacer; ac postea aedificatum est Templum, in quo etiam omnia repraesentativa erant, sicut picturae inibi, lavacra extra illud, mare aeneum sub quo boves qui portabant, tum columnae et porticus, cum vasis ex auro, quae omnia illis licuit colere sicut sancta, modo agnoscerent Tabernaculum ac postea Templum pro Habitaculo Jehovae: haec data sunt illis ne deflecterent ad idololatrica et magica, quae tunc erant apud varias gentes in Asia, ut in Aegypto, Syria, Assyria, Babele, Tyro et Sidone, Arabia, Aethiopia, Mesopotamia, ac imprimis in terra Canaane, et circum illam.<p>[3] Ex his constare potest unde est quod "idola" in Verbo significent falsa religionis, ac "imagines" doctrinalia.
