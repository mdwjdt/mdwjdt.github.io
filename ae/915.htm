<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 915</h4><p>915. (Verse 18) And another angel went out from the altar. That this signifies manifestation from the Lord concerning the devastation of the church as to the good of love and charity, is evident from the signification of an angel going out, as denoting manifestation from the Lord (see above, n. <a href="../ae/914.htm">914</a>); and from the signification of an altar, as denoting, in the highest sense, the Divine good of the Divine love; and thence in a relative sense the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity towards the neighbour (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/490.htm">490</a>).<p>The reason of this signification of the altar shall also be here explained in a few words. In the church instituted among the sons of Israel, there were two chief things of worship - the tent of the assembly and the altar; and afterwards the temple and the altar. In the temple the Word was taught, and upon the altar the sacrifices were offered; these were the chief things of their worship. And because the church instituted among them was representative, therefore, those two represented all things of the church in summary; all of which have reference to the truth of doctrine from the Word, and to the good of love and charity; from these two, also, arises all worship in the church. And since all the representatives of the church looked to the Lord as the end and the cause - thus to whom and from whom all things are - therefore by the temple was represented the Lord as to Divine truth; and by the altar the Lord as to Divine good. Concerning this representation of the temple, see above (n. <a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>); and of the altar (n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/490.htm">490</a>).<p>Now because all things of the church, and thence of worship, have reference to those two things, namely, to the truth of doctrine and to the good of love, and all things of heaven to the Divine truth and the Divine good - both from the Lord; and, since, when these are vastated, there is no longer any church, therefore two angels were seen by John, by whom the devastation of the church as to both was represented. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 915</h4><p>915. Verse 18. And another angel went out from the altar, signifies manifestation by the Lord of the devastation of the church as to the good of love and charity. This is evident from the signification of "an angel going out," as being manifestation by the Lord (See above, n. <a href="../ae/914.htm">914</a>); also from the signification of "altar," as being in the highest sense the Divine good of the Divine love; and in a relative sense the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity towards the neighbor (See above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/490.htm">490</a>). Why "the altar" has this signification shall be told in a few words. In the church instituted among the sons of Israel there were two things that were the chief things of worship, namely, the Tent of meeting and the altar, and afterwards the temple and the altar. In the temple the Word was taught, and upon the altar sacrifices were made, and these were the chief things of their worship; and as the church established among them was a representative church these two represented in brief all things of the church; and all things of the church in brief relate to the truth of doctrine from the Word and to the good of love and charity. Moreover, from these two all the worship of the church comes; and as all the representatives of the church looked to the Lord as the end and as the cause, thus as the one to whom all things relate and from whom they are, so the temple represented the Lord as to the Divine truth, and the altar the Lord as to the Divine good. (On this representation of the temple see above, n. <a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>; and of the altar, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/490.htm">490</a>.) Now as all things of the church, and thus of worship, relate to these two, namely, to the truth of doctrine and the good of love, and all things of heaven to the Divine truth and the Divine good, both from the Lord, and as there is no longer any church when these two are laid waste, so two angels appeared to John, and by these the devastation of the church in respect to both was represented. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 915 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>915. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_18" target=_top>18</a>.] "Et alius angelus exivit ex altari." Quod significet manifestationem a Domino de devastatione ecclesiae quoad bonum amoris et charitatis, constat ex significatione "angeli exeuntis", quod sit manifestatio a Domino (ut mox supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_914" target=_top>914</a>); et ex significatione "altaris", quod in supremo sensu sit Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, et inde in sensu respectivo bonum amoris in Dominum, et bonum charitatis erga proximum (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_490" target=_top>490</a>). Paucis etiam hic dicetur unde est quod "altare" illa significet. In ecclesia apud filios Israelis instituta fuerunt duo quae principalia cultus erant, nempe tentorium conventus et altare, ac postea templum et altare; in templo docebatur Verbum, et super altari fiebant sacrificia; haec erant principalia cultus illorum: et quia ecclesia apud illos instaurata fuit ecclesia repraesentativa, ideo illa duo repraesentabant omnia ecclesiae in summa; et omnia ecclesiae in summa se referunt ad verum doctrinae ex Verbo, et ad bonum amoris et charitatis; ex his duobus etiam omnis cultus ecclesiae fit; et quia omnia repraesentativa ecclesiae spectabant Dominum ut finem ac ut causam, ita ad quem et a quo omnia, ideo per templum repraesentabatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum ac per altare Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum. (De qua templi repraesentatione, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_220" target=_top>220</a>; et de altaris, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_490" target=_top>490</a>.) Quia nunc omnia ecclesiae et inde cultus se referunt ad duo illa, nempe ad verum doctrinae et ad bonum amoris, ac omnia caeli ad Divinum Verum et ad Divinum Bonum, utrumque a Domino, et quia cum haec vastata sunt non amplius est aliqua ecclesia, ideo visi sunt Johanni bini angeli, per quos repraesentata est devastatio ecclesiae quoad utrumque. </p>
