<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 933</h4><p>933. And over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name. That this signifies, and who have not acknowledged the doctrine of faith separated from charity, nor anything characterising it, is evident from the signification of the beast, of whose image, mark, and number of the name it is here spoken, as denoting faith separated from charity, or faith without good works (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/773.htm">773</a>, <a href="../ae/815.htm">815</a>); and from the signification of his image, as denoting the doctrine of that faith (see n. 827); and from the signification of his mark, as denoting the acknowledgment and confession thereof (see n. <a href="../ae/838.htm">838</a>); and from the signification of the number of his name, as denoting what is similar as to life and as to faith, thus, its quality; and, consequently, falsities in their whole extent (see n. <a href="../ae/841.htm">841</a>, <a href="../ae/845.htm">845</a> <a href="../ae/847.htm">847</a>). Hence by the image, mark, and number of his name, taken together, is signified the non-acknowledgment and confession of faith separated as to its doctrine, and as to any quality of it. To have victory over them, signifies to reject them in life and doctrine, which is also effected by combating against the falsities that are raised by the followers of that faith.<p>Continuation:-</p><p>[2] In the above article it was said, that at this day it is scarcely known in what charity, and consequently good works, consist, except this, to give to the poor, enrich the needy, doing good to widows and orphans, and contributing largely for the building of churches and hospitals for the poor and the sick. But still it is not known whether or not these things are done from man, and for the sake of reward; for if they are done from man, they are not good; and if for the sake of reward, they are merit-seeking; and neither of these opens heaven; and, therefore, they are not acknowledged as goods in heaven. In heaven no other works are regarded as good but such as are done from the Lord with man; and yet the works which are done from the Lord with man appear in outward form like those which are from man himself; indeed, they are not distinguished even by the man who does them. For the works that are done from the Lord with man are also done by man as of himself; and unless they are so done as of himself, they do not conjoin him to the Lord; thus, they do not reform him. That man ought to do goods as of himself may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/616.htm">616</a>, <a href="../ae/864.htm">864</a>, <a href="../ae/911.htm">911</a>). This subject will be continued in an article to follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 933</h4><p>933. And over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, signifies and that have not acknowledged the doctrine of faith separated from charity, or any quality of it. This is evident from the signification of "the beast," whose "image," "mark," and "number of name," are here mentioned, as being faith separated from charity, or faith without good works (See above, n. <a href="../ae/773.htm">773</a>, <a href="../ae/815.htm">815</a>); also from the signification of "his image," as being the doctrine of that faith (See n. <a href="../ae/827.htm">827</a> also from the signification of "mark," as being the acknowledgment and confession of that faith (See n. <a href="../ae/838.htm">838</a>); also from the signification of "the number of his name," as being what is like it as to life and as to faith, thus its quality, also as being falsities in the whole complex (See n. <a href="../ae/841.htm">841</a>, <a href="../ae/845.htm">845</a>, <a href="../ae/847.htm">847</a>). So "the image, mark, and number of his name," signify, when taken together, not acknowledging and confessing faith separated as to its doctrine, and as to any quality of it. "To have victory over these" signifies to reject them in life and doctrine, which is effected by combat against the falsities that the followers of that faith offer in opposition.</p><p>[2] It has been said in the previous article that at this day it is scarcely known what is meant by charity, and thus by good works, unless it be giving to the poor, enriching the needy, doing good to widows and orphans, and contributing to the building of temples, hospitals, and lodging houses; and yet whether such works are done by man and for the sake of reward is not known; for if they are done by man they are not good, and if for the sake of reward they are meritorious; and such works do not open heaven, and thus are not acknowledged as goods in heaven. In heaven no works are regarded as good except such as are done by the Lord with man, and yet the works that are done by the Lord with man appear in outward form like those done by the man himself, and cannot be distinguished even by the man who does them. For the works done by the Lord with man are done by man as if by himself; and unless they are done as if by himself they do not conjoin man to the Lord, thus they do not reform him. That man ought to do goods as if by himself may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/616.htm">616</a>, <a href="../ae/864.htm">864</a>, <a href="../ae/911.htm">911</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 933 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>933. "Et de imagine ejus, et de charactere ejus, et de numero nominis ejus." - Quod significet et qui non agnoverunt doctrinam fidei separatae a charitate et aliquid quale ejus, constat ex significatione "bestiae", de cujus "imagine", "charactere", et "numero nominis" hic dicitur, quod sit fides separata a charitate, seu fides absque bonis operibus (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_773" target=_top>773</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_815" target=_top>815</a> [a]): ex significatione "imaginis" ejus, quod sit doctrina illius fidei (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_827" target=_top>827</a> [a]); ex significatione "characteris", quod sit agnitio et confessio ejus (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_838" target=_top>838</a>); et ex significatione "numeri nominis ejus", quod sit simile ejus quoad vitam et quoad fidem, ita quale ejus, et quod sint falsa in omni complexu (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_841" target=_top>841</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_845" target=_top>845</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_847" target=_top>847</a>); inde per "imaginem, characterem et numerum nominis ejus" simul sumpta significatur non agnitio et confessio fidei separatae quoad doctrinam ejus, et quoad ullum quale ejus: "victoriam habere" de illis, significat illa rejicere vita et doctrina, quod etiam fit per pugnam contra falsa quae sectatores illius fidei objiciunt.<p>[2] [Continuatio.] <p>In superiore articulo dictum est quod hodie vix sciatur quid charitas, proinde quid bona opera, nisi solum dare pauperibus, opitulari egenis, benefacere viduis et pupillis, et conferre sportas aedificandis templis, hospitaliis et xenodochiis; sed usque non scitur num sint ab homine, et propter mercedem; nam si ab homine, non sunt bona; et si propter mercedem, sunt meritoria; et utraque non aperiunt caelum, et inde nec agnoscuntur pro bonis in caelo: in caelo non alia opera spectantur ut bona quam quae sunt a Domino apud hominem; et usque opera quae fiunt a Domino apud hominem, in externa forma apparent similia illis quae fiunt ab ipso homine; immo etiam ab homine, qui facit illa, non internoscuntur; nam opera quae fiunt a Domino apud hominem, fiunt etiam ab homine sicut ab ipso; et nisi fiant sicut ab ipso, non conjungunt illum Domino, ita non reformant illum; quod homo sicut a se bona facere debeat, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_616" target=_top>616</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_864" target=_top>864</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_933/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_911" target=_top>911</a> [c]).<p>(Continuatio in sequente articulo.) </p>
