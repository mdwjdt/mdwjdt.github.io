<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 297</h4><p>297. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>) And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. That this signifies the Lord as to omnipotence and as to omniscience, is evident from the signification of the right hand when said of the Lord, as denoting omnipotence and also omniscience (concerning which we shall speak presently): and from the signification of Him that sat upon the throne, as denoting the Lord as to Divine good in heaven. For throne signifies heaven in general, specifically the spiritual heaven, and, in the abstract, the Divine truth proceeding, from which heaven is, and by which judgment is effected (as may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_22.htm">5:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>).<p>By the Father is meant the Lord as to Divine good; and by the Son of man, the Lord as to Divine truth. The reason why Divine good judges no one, is, because it explores no one: but Divine truth [judges], for this explores every one. But still it must be known that the Lord Himself does not judge any one from the Divine truth that proceeds from Him, for this is united to the Divine good, so that they are one, but that a man-spirit judges himself: for it is the Divine truth received by him that judges him; and because it appears as if the Lord judges him, it is therefore said in the Word that all are judged by the Lord. This also the Lord teaches in John:<p>Jesus said, "And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejected me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the Word that I have spoken, it shall judge him in the last day" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_47.htm">12:47</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_48.htm">48</a>).</p><p>[2] For with respect to judgment, the case is this: the Lord is present with all, and from Divine love wills to save all and also turns and leads all to Himself. Those who are in good, and thence in truths, follow, for they apply themselves; but those who are in evil, and thence in falsities, do not follow, but turn themselves away from the Lord, and to turn themselves away from the Lord is [to turn] from heaven to hell; for every man spirit is either his own good and the truth thence, or he is his own evil and the falsity thence. He who is in good and the truth therefrom, suffers himself to be led by the Lord; but he who is in evil and the falsity thence, does not suffer himself to be led. The latter resists with all his might and effort; for he wills according to his own love, which inspires and animates him; therefore his desire is to those who are in a similar love of evil. Hence it is evident that the Lord judges no one, but that the Divine truth received judges to heaven those who have received Divine truth in the heart, that is, in the love: and to hell those who have not received Divine truth in the heart, and have denied it. From these considerations it is evident how the Lord's words must be understood. "All judgment is [given] to the Son, because he is the Son of man." And elsewhere, that "he came not to judge the world but to save the world, and that the Word which he has spoken will judge him."</p><p>[3] But these things are such as do not fall into man's own intelligence, for they are amongst the arcana of the wisdom of the angels. This subject, however, is in some measure elucidated in the work concerning <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">25:31</a>:<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">19:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_29.htm">29</a>).<p>Again in Ezekiel:<p>"And above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man sitting upon it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">1:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>)<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his borders filled the temple" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">6:1</a>).</p><p>[4] Because by a throne is signified heaven, and by one sitting upon a throne, the Lord as to His Divine in heaven, therefore it is said above (in chap. iii.), "To him that overcometh, I will give to sit with me on my throne," by which is signified that he shall be in heaven where the Lord is (as may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_6.htm">5:6</a>).<p>And in chapter 12,<p>"He shewed me a river of the water of life, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12</a>).<p>By the throne of God and of the Lamb, is meant heaven and the Lord there, as to Divine good, and as to Divine truth; God there denoting the Lord as to Divine good; and the Lamb, as to Divine truth. There is a distinction made here between them, because there are those who receive one more than the other; those who receive the Divine truth in good are saved; but those who receive the Divine truth, which is the Word, not in good, are not saved, because all Divine truth is in good, and nowhere else. Therefore those who do not receive it in good, reject and deny it, if not openly yet tacitly, and if not with the mouth yet with the heart; for the heart of such is evil, and evil rejects. To receive Divine truth in good, is to receive it in the good of charity; for those who are in that good receive. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 297</h4><p>297. Verse 1. And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, signifies the Lord in respect to omnipotence and omniscience. This is evident from the signification of "right hand," as being, in reference to the Lord, omnipotence and also omniscience (of which presently); also from the signification of "Him that sat upon the throne," as being the Lord in respect to Divine good in heaven; for in general "throne" signifies heaven, in particular the spiritual heaven, and abstractly Divine truth proceeding, from which heaven is, and by which judgment is effected (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>).<p>"Father" means the Lord in respect to Divine good; "the Son of man," the Lord in respect to Divine truth. Divine good "doth not judge anyone," because it explores no one; but Divine truth judges, for it explores everyone. Yet it should be known, that neither does the Lord Himself judge anyone from the Divine truth that proceeds from Him, for this is so united to Divine good that they are one; but the man-spirit judges himself; for it is the Divine truth received by himself that judges him; but because the appearance is that the Lord judges, therefore it is said in the Word that all are judged by the Lord. This the Lord also teaches in John:<p>Jesus said, If any man hear My words and yet believe not, I judge him not; for I have not come to judge the world but to save the world. He that rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>).</p><p>[2] For in respect to judgment, the case is this: The Lord is present with all, and from Divine Love He wills to save all, and He turns and leads all towards Himself. Those who are in good and in truths therefrom follow, for they apply themselves, but those who are in evil and in falsities therefrom do not follow, but turn backwards from the Lord, and to turn themselves backwards from the Lord is to turn from heaven to hell; for every man-spirit is either his own good and the truth therefrom, or his own evil and the falsity therefrom. He who is a good and the truth therefrom permits himself to be led by the Lord; but he who is an evil and the falsity therefrom does not permit himself to be led; he resists with all his strength and endeavor, for his will is toward his own love; for this love is his breath and life; therefore his desire is toward those who are in a like love of evil. From this it can be seen that the Lord does not judge anyone, but that Divine truth received judges to heaven those who have received Divine truth in the heart, that is, in love; and it judges to hell those who have not received Divine truth in the heart, and who have denied it. Thence it is clear what is meant by the Lord's saying that "all judgment is given to the Son, because He is the Son of man," and elsewhere, that "He came not to judge the world but to save the world," and that the Word which He has spoken is to judge man. "</p><p>[3] These, however, are truths that do not fall into man's self-intelligence, for they are among the arcana of the wisdom of angels. (But the matter is somewhat elucidated in the work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">19:28-29</a>).<p>Also in Ezekiel:<p>Above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne; and upon the likeness of the throne a likeness as the appearance of a man sitting upon it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filling the temple (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>).</p><p>[4] Since by "throne" heaven is signified, and by "Him that sat upon the throne" the Lord in respect to His Divine in heaven, it is said above, in chapter 3:<p>He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit with Me on My throne (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>);<p>signifying that he shall be in heaven where the Lord is (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_6.htm">Revelation 3:6</a>);<p>and in chapter 22:<p>He showed me a river of water of life, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>).<p>"The throne of God and of the Lamb" means heaven and the Lord there in respect to Divine good and as to Divine truth; "God" meaning the Lord in respect to Divine good; and "the Lamb," the Lord in respect to Divine truth. A distinction is here made between the two, because there are those that receive the one more than the other. Those that receive Divine truth in good are saved; but those that receive Divine truth (which is the Word) not in good are not saved, since all Divine truth is in good and not elsewhere; consequently those that do not receive it in good reject it and deny it, if not openly yet tacitly, and if not with the mouth yet with the heart; for the heart of such is evil, and evil rejects. To receive Divine truth in good is to receive it in the good of charity; for those who are in that good receive. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 297 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>297. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_5_1" target=_top>1</a>.] "Et vidi in dextra Sedentis super throno." Quod significet Dominum quoad omnipotentiam et quoad omniscientiam, constat ex significatione "dextrae", cum de Domino, quod sit omnipotentia et quoque omniscientia (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "Sedentis super throno", quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum in caelo, "thronus" enim significat in genere caelum, in specie caelum spirituale, et abstracte Divinum Verum procedens, ex quo caelum et per quod judicium (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_253" target=_top>253</a>). Quod Dominus intelligatur per "Sedentem super throno", et quoque per "Agnum" qui ex Sedente super throno accepit librum, est quia per "Sedentem super throno" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Agnum" Dominus quoad Divinus Verum: sunt enim duo quae procedunt a Domino ut Sole caeli, nempe Divinum Bonum ac Divinum Verum; Divinum Bonum a Domino vocatur "Pater in caelis", et hic intelligitur per "Sedentem super throno", ac Divinum Verum a Domino vocatur "Filius hominis", hic autem "Agnus "; et quia Divinum Bonum neminem judicat, sed Divinum Verum, ideo hic dicitur quod "Agnus acceperit librum a Sedente super throno." Quod Divinum Bonum neminem judicet sed Divinum Verum, intelligitur per Domini verba apud Johannem,<p>"Non Pater judicat quemquam, sed omne judicium dedit Filio, .... quia Filius hominis est" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_22" target=_top>5:22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_27" target=_top>27</a>);<p>per "Patrem" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Filium hominis" Dominus quoad Divinum Verum. Quod Divinum Bonum non judicet quemquam, est quia illud explorat neminem; sed Divinum Verum, hoc enim explorat unumquemvis. At usque sciendum est quod Ipse Dominus nec judicet aliquem ex Divino Vero quod procedit ab Ipso, hoc enim unitum est Divino Bono ita ut sint unum, sed quod homo spiritus se ipsum judicet; est enim Divinum Verum ab ipso receptum quod illum judicat; et hoc quia apparet sicut Dominus judicet, ideo in Verbo dicitur quod omnes judicentur a Domino: hoc quoque docet Dominus apud Johannem,<p>Jesus dixit, "Si quis audiverit mea verba, non tamen crediderit, Ego non judico illum, non enim veni ut judicem mundum, sed ut salvem mundum; qui spernit Me, et non accipit verba mea, habet judicantem se, verbum quod locutus sum, illud judicabit illum in extremo die" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_47" target=_top>12:47</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_48" target=_top>48</a>).<p>[2] Cum Judicio enim ita fit :-Dominus praesens est apud omnes, et ex Divino Amore vult salvare omnes, et quoque vertit et adducit ad Se omnes. Qui in bono sunt et inde veris, illi sequuntur, nam applicant se; at qui in malo sunt et inde falsis, non sequuntur, sed vertunt se retro a Domino, et vertere se retro a Domino est a caelo ad infernum: omnis enim homo spiritus est vel suum bonum et inde verum, vel est suum malum et inde falsum; qui est bonum et inde verum, ille se adduci patitur a Domino; at qui est malum et inde falsum, ille non se adduci patitur, hic omni vi et conatu renititur, vult enim ad suum amorem, hunc spirat et animat; quare ad illos cupit qui in simili amore mali sunt. Exinde constare potest quod non Dominus judicet aliquem, sed quod Divinum Verum receptum judicet ad caelum illos qui receperunt Divinum Verum corde, hoc est, amore; et ad infernum illos qui non receperunt Divinum Verum corde, et qui negaverunt illud. Ex his constare potest quomodo intelligendum quod Dominus dixerit, quod "omne judicium sit Filio quia Filius hominis est", et alibi, quod "non venerit ut judicet mundum, sed ut salvet mundum", et quod "Verbum quod locutus est judicaturum sit illum."<p>[3] Sed haec talia sunt quae non cadunt in intelligentiam propriam hominis, sunt enim inter arcana sapientiae angelorum. (Sed usque de hac re aliquid elucidatum est in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_545" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 545-551</a>, ubi actum est de eo, Quod Dominus neminem in Infernum conjiciat, sed quod ipse spiritus semet.) Quod Dominus sit qui intelligitur per "Sedentem super throno", et non alius quem distinguunt ab Ipso et vocant "Deum Patrem", constare unicuivis potest ex eo, quod non aliud Divinum fuerit quod Dominus vocavit "Patrem" quam suum Divinum; hoc enim assumpsit Humanum, quare hoc fuit Pater Ipsius; et quod hoc sit infinitum, aeternum, increatum, omnipotens, Deus, Dominus, et prorsus nihil differens ab ipso Divino quod distinguunt ab Ipso et vocant "Patrem", constare potest a recepta Fide quae Athanasiana vocatur: ubi etiam dicitur<p>Quod nemo Eorum maximus et minimus et nemo Eorum primus et ultimus, sed prorsus aequales; et quod sicut unus ita alter infinitus, aeternus, increatus, omnipotens, Deus, Dominus, et tamen non tres infiniti sed unus, non tres aeterni sed unus, non tres increati sed unus non tres omnipotentes sed unus, non tres Dii et Domini sed unus.<p>Haec dicta sunt, ut sciatur quod non duo distincti intelligantur per "Sedentem super throno" et "Agnum", ac in sequentibus per "Deum" et "Agnum", sed quod per unum intelligatur Divinum Bonum et per alterum Divinum Verum in caelo, utrumque procedens a Domino. Quod Dominus intelligatur per "Sedentem super throno", constat etiam ex singulis in capite praecedente 4, ubi agitur de Throno et de Sedente super illo (quae videantur explicata a n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_258" target=_top>258</a> ad <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_295" target=_top>295</a>): et praeterea apud Matthaeum,<p>"Quando venerit Filius hominis in gloria sua, et omnes sancti angelicum Ipso, tunc sedebit super throno gloriae suae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_31" target=_top>25:31</a>; cap.<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_28" target=_top>19:28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_29" target=_top>29</a>);<p>tum apud Ezechielem,<p>"Super expansum quod super capite" cheruborum "quasi aspectus lapidis sapphiri, similitudo throni, et super similitudine throni similitudo aspectus Hominis super illo sedentis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_26" target=_top>1:26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_1" target=_top>10:1</a>);<p>et apud Esaiam,<p>"Vidi Dominum sedentem super throno alto et elato, et fimbriae Ipsius implentes templum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_6_1" target=_top>6:1</a>).<p>[4] Quia per "thronum" significatur caelum, et per "Sedentem super throno" Dominus quoad Divinum Ipsius in caelo, ideo dictum est supra, in capite iii.,<p>"Vincens, dabo ei sedere Mecum in throno meo" ([vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_21" target=_top>3:21</a>]);<p>per quod significatur, quod erit in caelo ubi Dominus (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_235" target=_top>235</a> [b]); ac ideo infra in hoc capite dicitur<p>"Vidi, et ecce in medio throni Agnum stantem" (vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_6" target=_top>3:6</a>);<p>et in capite <sup>1</sup></p><p>xxii.,<p>"Ostendit mihi fluvium aquae <sup>2</sup></p><p>vitae ... exeuntem ex throno Dei et Agni" (vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_297/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_1" target=_top>22:1</a>);<p>per "thronum Dei et Agni" intelligitur caelum et Dominus ibi quoad Divinum Bonum et quoad Divinum Verum; "Deus" ibi est Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et "Agnus" quoad Divinum Verum: distinguitur hic inter utrumque, quia sunt qui recipiunt plus unum quam alterum; qui recipiunt Divinum Verum in bono illi salvantur, qui autem recipiunt Divinum Verum, quod est Verbum, non in bono, illi non salvantur, quoniam omne Divinum Verum est in Bono et non alibi; quare qui non recipiunt illud in bono, illi rejiciunt illud et negant illud, si non palam usque tacite, et si non ore usque corde; nam cor eorum est malum, et malum rejicit. Recipere Divinum Verum in bono, est in bono charitatis; nam qui in illo sunt, ii recipiunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
