<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 784</h4><p>784. Verse 3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded unto death; and his death stroke was healed, and the whole earth wondered after the beast.<p>"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded unto death," signifies the discordance of their doctrinals with the Word, in which love, life, and works, are so often mentioned, which do not at all agree with that religious persuasion; "and his death stroke was healed," signifies the discordance apparently removed by assumed conjunctions of works with faith; "and the whole earth wondered after the beast," signifies acceptance by the more learned in the church, and a remote reception by those who are less learned. </p>

VERSUS 3.<p>"Et vidi unum capitum ejus sicut sauciatum in mortem, et plaga mortis ejus sanata est; et admirata est tota terra post bestiam."<p>3. "Et vidi unum capitum ejus sicut sauciatum in mortem", significat discordantiam doctrinalium eorum cum Verbo, ubi "amor", "vita" et "opera" toties dicuntur, quae cum illo religioso prorsus non concordant [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_784/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_785" target=_top>785</a>] ; et plaga mortis ejus sanata est", significat discordantiam apparenter summotam per inventas conjunctiones operum cum fide [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_784/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_786" target=_top>786</a>] ; "et admirata est tota terra post bestiam", significat acceptationem ab eruditioribus in ecclesia, et receptionem e longinquo a minus eruditis [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_784/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_787" target=_top>787</a>] . </p>
