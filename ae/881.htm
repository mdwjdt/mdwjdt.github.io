<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 881</h4><p>881. Because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. That this signifies the adulteration of all things of the good of heaven and the church by dire falsities of evil, is evident from the signification of wine, as denoting truth from good, and, in the opposite sense, falsity from evil; concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>); and from the signification, of anger, as denoting evil in its whole extent, and, consequently, hatred against good and truth, and the lust of destroying them; concerning which see also above (<a href="../ae/693.htm">693</a>, <a href="../ae/754.htm">754</a>); and from the signification of fornication, as denoting the falsification of truth; concerning which also see above (n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../ae/161.htm">161</a>) and from the signification of making all nations drink, as denoting to adulterate goods; for to give drink signifies to impart, and nations signify those who are in the good of love and life; and, abstractly from persons, goods.<p>That to drink, and to give to drink, signifies to impart and to appropriate, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/617.htm">617</a>). And that nations signify those who are in the good of love and of life, and, in the abstract, the goods of the church (n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>). By giving all nations to drink is here signified to adulterate the goods of the Word and hence of the church, because by the wine of the wrath of fornication is signified the falsification of truth; and falsified truth adulterates good. But how they falsify all the truths of the Word, and by this means adulterate all its goods, will be shown in the explanation of chapters 16 and 17, and where Babylon is treated of.<p>From these things it is now evident that by making all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, is signified the adulteration of all things of the good of heaven and the church by dire falsities of evil. They are called falsities of evil, because all falsities arising from the love of rule for the sake of self, and the eminence of self, are falsities of evil, and direful according to that love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 881</h4><p>881. For she hath given all nations to drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom, signifies the adulteration of all things of the good of heaven and the church by direful falsities of evil. This is evident from the signification of "wine," as being truth from good, and in the contrary sense falsity from evil (See above, n. <a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>; also from the signification of "anger," as being evil in the whole complex, and thus hatred against good and truth, and the desire to destroy them (See above, n. <a href="../ae/693.htm">693</a>, <a href="../ae/754.htm">754</a>); also from the signification of "whoredom," as being the falsification of truth (See above, n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../ae/161.htm">161</a>); also from the signification of "giving all nations to drink," as being to adulterate goods, for "to give to drink" signifies to imbue, and "nations" signify those who are in the good of love and of life, and in the sense abstracted from persons, goods. (That "to drink" and "to give to drink" signify to imbue and to appropriate, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/617.htm">617</a>; and that "nations" signify those who are in the good of love and of life, and in the abstract sense the goods of the church, n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>.) "To give all nations to drink" here signifies to adulterate the goods of the Word and thus of the church, because "the wine of the anger of whoredom" signifies the falsification of truth; and truth falsified adulterates good. But in what way all the truths of the Word are falsified and thus all its goods adulterated will be told in the explanation of chapters 16 and 17, where Babylon is treated of. From all this it can now be seen that "to give all nations to drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom" signifies the adulteration of all things of the good of heaven and the church by direful falsities of evil. They are called falsities of evil because all falsities arising from the love of ruling for the sake of self and self-eminence are falsities of evil, and are direful according to that love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 881 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>881. "Quia ex vino irae scortationis suae potavit omnes gentes." Quod significat adulterationem omnium boni caeli et ecclesiae per dira falsa mali, constat ex significatione "vini", quod sit verum ex bono, et in opposito sensu falsum ex malo (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_376" target=_top>376</a>); ex significatione "irae", quod sit malum in omni complexu, et inde odium contra bonum et verum, ac cupiditas destruendi illa (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_693" target=_top>693</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_754" target=_top>754</a>); ex significatione "scortationis", quod sit falsificatio veri (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_141" target=_top>141</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_161" target=_top>161</a>); et ex significatione "potare omnes gentes", quod sit adulterare bona, "potare" enim significat imbuere, et "gentes" significant illos qui in bono amoris et vitae sunt, et abstracte a personis bona; (quod "bibere" et "potare" significet imbuere et appropriare, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_617" target=_top>617</a> [a, c-e] ; et quod "gentes" significent illos qui in bono amoris et vitae sunt, et abstracte bona ecclesiae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_175" target=_top>175</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_331" target=_top>331</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_625" target=_top>625</a>); quod per "potare omnes gentes" hic significetur adulterare bona Verbi et inde ecclesiae, est quia per "vinum irae scortationis" significatur falsificatio veri, et falsificatum verum adulterat bonum: sed quomodo falsificant omnia vera Verbi, et sic adulterant omnia bona ejus, dicetur in explicatione capitum <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_16" target=_top>16</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_881/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_27" target=_top>27</a>, ubi de Babylone agitur. Ex his nunc constare potest quod per "ex vino irae scortationis suae potaverit omnes gentes" significetur adulteratio omnium boni caeli et ecclesiae per dira falsa mali. Falsa mali dicuntur, quia omnia falsa oriunda ex amore imperandi propter se et sui eminentiam sunt falsa mali, et secundum illum amorem dira. </p>
