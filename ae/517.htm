<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 517</h4><p>517. And there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp.- That this signifies the truth of the Word falsified from the proprium love, is evident from the signification of stars, as denoting the knowledges of truth and good, as well as the truths and goods of knowledges from the Word; concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>, <a href="../ae/402.htm">402</a>); and from the signification of burning as a lamp, as denoting to be falsified from the proprium love; to burn being said of the proprium love, because this love is signified by fire, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/504.htm">504:17</a>); and a lamp signifies the truth of the Word, of doctrine, and of faith, as may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/274.htm">274</a>). Hence it is evident, that by a great star falling from heaven, and burning as it were a lamp, is signified, the truth of the Word falsified from the proprium love.</p><p>[2] It must be known, that all those who are in the love of self, if they study the Word, falsify its truths. The reason of this is, that all truth is out of heaven from the Lord, and nothing [thereof] from the proprium of man; and those who are in the love of self are immersed in their proprium, and they take therefrom every idea of their thought concerning the truths of the Word. Hence it is, that they falsify those things, not as to the sense of the letter of the Word, but as to the understanding of the truth therein; for to understand words otherwise than according to their true sense, is to falsify them.</p><p>[3] There are two states of the thoughts of man, the one when he is in thought concerning truths from the Lord, and the other when [he is in thought] from himself. When he is in thought concerning truths from the Lord, then his mind is raised even into the light of heaven, and he consequently has an enlightenment and a just perception of truth; but when he is in thought concerning truths from himself, then his mind falls into the light of the world, and this light, in regard to spiritual things, or to things pertaining to heaven and the church, is thick darkness, in which man can see only such things as shine by means of the fire of the love of self and the love of the world, which things, in themselves, are falsities opposed to truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 517</h4><p>517. And there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp, signifies the truth of the Word falsified by self-love. This is evident from the signification of "stars," as being the knowledges of truth and good, likewise the truths and goods of knowledges from the Word (See above, n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>, <a href="../ae/402.htm">402</a>); also from the signification of "burning as a lamp," as being to be falsified by self-love; "to burn" is predicated of self-love because this love is signified by "fire" (See above, n. <a href="../ae/504.htm">504</a>, and a "lamp" signifies the truth of the Word, of doctrine, and of faith (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/274.htm">274</a>. From this it can be seen that "there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp" signifies the truth of the Word falsified by self-love.</p><p>[2] It is to be noted that all those who are in the love of self, if they study the Word, falsify its truths, for the reason that all truth is out of heaven from the Lord, and nothing of it from what is man's own [proprium], and those who are in the love of self are immersed in what is their own [proprium], and from that they obtain every idea of thought respecting the truths of the Word. In consequence of this they falsify these truths, not in respect to the sense of the letter of the Word, but in respect to the understanding of the truth that is in it; for to understand words otherwise than according to their true sense is to falsify them.</p><p>[3] There are two states of man's thoughts, one when from the Lord he is in thought respecting truths, the other when from himself. When from the Lord he is in thought respecting truths his mind is elevated even into the light of heaven, from which he has illustration and right perception of truth; but when from himself he is in thought respecting truths, his mind falls into the light of the world; and that light, in respect to things spiritual, or the things of heaven and the church, is thick darkness, in which man sees only such things as shine from the fire or the love of self and of the world, and these in themselves are falsities that are opposites of truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 517 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>517. "Et cecidit e caelo stella magna ardens quasi lampas." - Quod significet verum Verbi falsificatum ex amore proprio, constat ex significatione "stellarum", quod sint cognitiones veri et boni, tum vera et bona cognitionum ex Verbo (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_517/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_72" target=_top>72</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_517/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_402" target=_top>402</a>): et ex significatione "ardere sicut lampas", quod sit ex amore proprio falsificari; "ardere" dicitur de amore proprio, quia "ignis" significat illum, (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_517/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_504" target=_top>504</a> [c]); et "lampas" significat verum Verbi, doctrinae et fidei (videatur etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_517/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_274" target=_top>274</a>); inde constare potest quod per "cecidit e caelo stella magna ardens quasi lampas" significetur verum Verbi ex amore proprio falsificatum.<p>[2] Sciendum est quod omnes illi qui in amore sui sunt, si student Verbo, falsificent vera ejus; causa est, quia omne verum est e caelo a Domino, et nihil a proprio hominis; et illi qui in amore sui sunt, proprio suo immersi sunt, et inde captant omnem ideam cogitationis de veris Verbi: ex eo est quod falsificent illa, non quoad sensum litterae Verbi, sed quoad intellectum veri in illo; nam intelligere verba aliter quam secundum verum sensum eorum: est falsificare illa.<p>[3] Sunt duo status cogitationum hominis, unus dum in cogitatione de veris est a Domino, et alter dum a semet: quando est in cogitatione de veris a Domino, tunc elevatur ejus mens usque in lucem caeli; inde illi est illustratio et perceptio veri justa: at quando est in cogitatione de veris a semet, tunc cadit ejus mens in lucem mundi; quae lux quoad spiritualia, seu quoad illa quae caeli et ecclesiae sunt, est caligo, in qua homo non videt nisi talia quae lucent ab igne amoris sui et mundi, quae in se sunt falsa opposita veris. </p>
