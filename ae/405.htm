<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 405</h4><p>405. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places. That this signifies that all the good of love and the truth of faith perished, is plain from the signification of a mountain, as denoting the good of love to the Lord, concerning which we shall treat presently; from the signification of island, as denoting the truth of faith, which will be explained in the next article; and from the signification of, to be moved out of their places, as denoting to be taken away and to perish, since the good of love and the truth of faith are meant, for when these are moved out of their places, then evils and falsities succeed, and by the evils and falsities the goods and truths perish. The reason why a mountain signifies the good of love, is that in heaven those dwell upon mountains who are in the good of love to the Lord, and upon hills those who are in charity towards the neighbour, or what is the same, those who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom dwell upon mountains, and those who are of His spiritual kingdom, upon hills; and the celestial kingdom is distinguished from the spiritual kingdom in this [particular], that those who belong to the celestial kingdom are in love to the Lord, and those who belong to the spiritual kingdom in charity towards the neighbour (but concerning the latter and the former, see the work concerning <a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>). These are the reasons why by a mountain is signified the good of love to the Lord.</p><p>[2] That the good of love to the Lord is meant abstractedly by a mountain, is, because all things in the internal sense of the Word are spiritual, and spiritual things are meant apart from persons and places; therefore also the angels, because they are spiritual, think and speak in the abstract in regard to such things, and thereby they have intelligence and wisdom; for an idea of persons and places limits the thought, because it confines it to those things, and thus limits it. This idea of the thought is properly natural, whereas an idea apart from persons and places extends itself into heaven in every direction, and is no otherwise bounded than the sight of the eye while it views the sky without intervening objects; such an idea is properly spiritual. Hence it is that by a mountain, in the spiritual sense of the Word, is signified the good of love. It is the same with the signification of the earth, as denoting the church; for an idea apart from places, and from nations and people upon the earth, is that of the church there or with those [who live there]; this, therefore, is signified by the earth in the Word. It is the same with other things mentioned in the natural sense of the Word, as with hills, rocks, valleys, rivers, seas, cities, houses, gardens, woods, and other things.</p><p>[3] That a mountain signifies love to the Lord, and hence all the good that is from it, which is called celestial good; and that in the opposite sense, it signifies the love of self, and hence all the evil that is from that, is plain from the following passages in the Word. In Amos:<p>"Dispose thyself towards thy God, O Israel. For, lo, he is former of the mountains, and the creator of the spirit, and declareth unto man what is his thought" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_12.htm">4:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_13.htm">13</a>).<p>God is here called the former of the mountains, because mountains signify the goods of love; and the creator of the spirit, because spirit signifies the life therefrom; and because He thereby gives intelligence to man, it is added, and declareth to man what is his thought; for the intelligence of man is from his thought, which flows in from the Lord by the good of love into his life, therefore to declare here denotes to flow in.</p><p>[4] In David:<p>God "who setteth fast the mountains by his strength; he is girded with power" (<a href="../hh/228.htm">Heaven and Hell 228-233</a>, and above, n. <a href="../ae/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>; and that power when predicated of the Lord denotes omnipotence, see above, n. <a href="../ae/338.htm">338</a>.)</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>"I lift up mine eyes to the mountains, whence cometh help" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_121_1.htm">Psalms 121:1</a>).<p>By mountains are here meant the heavens; and because in the heavens those who are in the goods of love and charity dwell upon mountains and hills, as said above, and the Lord is in these goods, therefore to lift up the eyes to the mountains is also meant to the Lord, from whom is all aid. When mountains are mentioned in the plural number, both mountains and hills are meant, consequently, both the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity towards the neighbour.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>"There shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill, streams, courses of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers shall fall" (<a href="../lj/56.htm">Last Judgment 56</a>, <a href="../lj/58.htm">58</a>). That then those who are in love to the Lord, and in charity towards the neighbour, are raised into heaven, and gifted with intelligence and wisdom, is meant by,<p>"There shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill, streams, courses of waters." The high mountain signifies where those are who are in love to the Lord, and the lofty hill, where those are who are in charity towards the neighbour; streams signify wisdom, and courses of waters intelligence; for waters denote truths from which are intelligence and wisdom.</p><p>[7] In Joel:<p>"It shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streams of Judah shall flow with waters" (<a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>).</p><p>[8] In Nahum:<p>"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, [that publisheth] peace" (<a href="../ae/365.htm">365</a>); and by Zion, that bringeth good tidings, is meant the church which is in the good of love to the Lord; and by Jerusalem, that bringeth good tidings, the church which is thence in truths of doctrine from the Word.</p><p>[9] In Isaiah:<p>"I will set all my mountains into a way, and my highways shall be exalted. Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for Jehovah hath comforted his people" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_11.htm">49:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_13.htm">13</a>).<p>By mountains in the plural number, are meant both mountains and hills, thus both the good of love and the good of charity. That the mountains and hills shall be set into a way, and the highways shall be exalted, signifies that those who are in those goods, shall be in genuine truths; to be set into a way signifying to be in truths, and the highways being exalted, signifies to be in genuine truths. For ways and highways signify truths that are said to be exalted from good, and truths that are from good are genuine truths. Their joy of heart thence is signified by, "Sing, O heavens, be joyful, O earth"; internal joy [being signified] by, sing, O heavens, and external joy by, be joyful, O earth. Confessions from joy originating in the good of love, are signified by, "break forth into singing, O mountains"; that this is on account of reformation and regeneration, is signified by, "for Jehovah hath comforted his people." That mountains in the world are not here meant, is evident; for to what purpose would it be for the mountains to be set into a way, for the highways to be exalted, and also for the mountains to break forth into singing?</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>"Sing, O ye heavens; shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, ye forest, and every tree therein; for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath shown himself full of glory in Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_23.htm">44:23</a>).<p>By, "Sing, O ye heavens, shout, ye lower parts of the earth, break forth into singing, ye mountains," are signified the same things as just above; but here by mountains are signified the goods of charity; therefore it is also said, ye forest, and every tree therein, for by a forest is meant the external or natural man as to all things thereof, and by every tree is meant the knowing and scientific part there. The reformation of those is signified by, "Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath shown himself full of glory in Israel." By Jacob and Israel is meant the church external and internal; thus the external and internal with those in whom the church is.</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>The mountains and hills shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field clap their hands" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_55_12.htm">55:12</a>).<p>In David:<p>"Praise Jehovah, ye mountains and hills; ye tree of fruit, and all cedars" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_9.htm">9</a>).<p>In these words is described joy of heart from the good of love and charity; and mountains, hills, trees, cedars, are said to break forth into singing, to clap their hands and to praise, because thereby are signified the goods and truths that are the cause of joys to man; for man does not rejoice from himself, but from the goods and truths that he has; these things rejoice because they make the rejoicing of man.</p><p>[12] In Isaiah:<p>"The wilderness and the cities thereof shall lift up their voice, and the villages that Arabia doth inhabit; the inhabitants of the rock shall sing, they shall shout from the top of the mountains" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_11.htm">42:11</a>).<p>By the wilderness is signified an obscure [state] of truth; by the cities thereof are signified doctrinals; by the villages, natural knowledges and scientifics. By Arabia is signified the natural man, for an Arabian in the wilderness denotes the natural man. By the inhabitants of the rock are signified the goods of faith, or those who are in the goods of faith. By the top of the mountains is signified the good of love to the Lord. Hence it is clear that the particulars signify in order, confession and joyful worship, from the good of love in such things as are mentioned; to shout from the top of the mountains, denotes to worship from the good of love.</p><p>[13] In David:<p>"The mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is the mountain of Bashan. Why leap ye, ye mountains, ye hills of the mountain? God desireth to dwell in it; yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_15.htm">Psalms 68:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_16.htm">16</a>).<p>By the mountain of Bashan is signified voluntary good, such as exists with those who are in the externals of the church; for Bashan was a region beyond Jordan, which was given for an inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh, as may be seen in Joshua (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_29.htm">13:29-32</a>); and by Manasseh is signified the voluntary good of the external or natural man. This voluntary good is the same as the good of love in the external man, for all good of love pertains to the will, and all the truth thence to the understanding. Therefore by Ephraim, his brother, is signified the intellectual truth of that good. Because the mountain of Bashan signifies that good, therefore by the hills of that mountain are signified goods in act. Because the will acts - for all the active part of the mind and body is from the will, as all the active part of the thought and speech is from the understanding - therefore the joy arising from the good of love is described and meant by leaping and skipping; hence it is clear what is signified by, "The mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is the mountain of Bashan; why leap ye, ye mountains, ye hills of the mountain?" Because the Lord dwells in man in his voluntary good, whence [proceed] goods in act, therefore it is said, God desireth to dwell in it; yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>"Judah became the sanctuary of Jehovah, [and Israel his property]. The sea saw it and fled: Jordan turned back. The mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock. What possessedst thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou turnedst back? ye mountains, that ye leaped like rams; and ye hills, like the sons of the flock? Thou bringest forth, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_1.htm">Psalms 114:1</a> to the end).<p>The departure of the sons of Israel out of Egypt is thus described; nevertheless, without explanation by the internal sense, no one can know the signification of the mountains then leaping like rams, and the hills like the sons of the flock, also the meaning of the sea saw it and fled, and Jordan turned back; therefore it shall be explained. The establishment of the church, or the regeneration of the men of the church, is meant in the internal sense, for the church to be established is signified by the sons of Israel; the establishment, by their departure; the shaking off of evils is signified by the passage through the Red Sea, concerning which it is said that it fled; and introduction into the church is signified by the passing over Jordan, concerning which it is said that it turned back. But for the particulars: That Judah became a sanctuary, and Israel a property, signifies that the good of love to the Lord is the very holiness of heaven and the church, and that truth from that good is the means of government. For by Judah is signified celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; by the sanctuary, the very holiness of heaven and the church; by Israel, spiritual good, which is truth from that good by means of which there is government; for all government pertains to the Lord by means of Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good. By, "The sea saw it and fled; Jordan turned back," is signified that the evils and falsities which were in the natural man, having been shaken off, scientific truths and the knowledges of truth and good succeeded. "The mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock," signifies that celestial good, which is the good of love, and spiritual good, which is the truth from that good, from joy do goods, or produce an effect. Mountains signify the good of love; hills, the goods of charity, which in their essence are truths from that good; to leap, because said of these, signifies from joy to do goods. It is said like rams, and like the sons of the flock, because rams signify the goods of charity, and sons of the flock the truths thence. The establishment of the church thereby, or the regeneration of the men of the church, is signified by, "Thou bringest forth, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters." The earth denotes the church, and it is said to bring forth, when it is established, or the man of the church is born anew; it is said, at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of the God of Jacob, because where the good of love is treated of in the Word, the Lord is called the Lord; and when goods in act [are treated of, He is called] the God of Jacob. Regeneration by truths from goods is signified by, "He turned the rock into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters." By a pool of waters are signified knowledges of truth, and by a fountain of waters is signified the Word from which these are; and by the rock, the natural man as to truth before reformation, and by the flint, the natural man as to good before reformation.</p><p>[15] In the same:<p>"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the nations, and planted it. The mountains were covered by its shadow, and the cedars of God by its branches" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_8.htm">Psalms 80:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_10.htm">10</a>).<p>By the vine out of Egypt is signified the spiritual church, which commences with man by scientifics and knowledges in the natural man; the vine denotes the spiritual church, and Egypt denotes the Scientific which is in the natural man. By, "Thou hast cast out the nations, and planted it," is signified that after evils were cast out, the church is established; the nations denoting evils, and to plant a vine denoting to establish that church. By, "The mountains were covered by its shadow, and the cedars of God by its branches," is signified that the whole [church is] from spiritual goods and truths; the mountains denoting spiritual goods, and the cedars of God denoting spiritual truths. That the bringing forth of the sons of Israel out of Egypt, and their introduction into the land of Canaan, whence the nations were expelled, are meant by these words, is evident; but still by the same words, in the internal sense, are meant such things as have been explained; nor was anything else represented and signified by the introduction of the sons of Israel into the land of Canaan, and by the expulsion of the nations thence; for all the historical parts of the Word, as well as its prophetical parts, involve spiritual things.</p><p>[16] In Isaiah:<p>"On all mountains that shall be weeded with the hoe, the fear of the briar and thorn shall not come thither; but there shall be the sending forth of the ox, and the treading of the sheep" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_25.htm">7:25</a>).<p>By the mountains which shall be weeded with the hoe, are meant those who do goods from the love of good. What is signified by the rest may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_9.htm">65:9</a>).<p>By Jacob and Judah is signified the church; by Jacob, the external church, which is in the knowledges of good and truth; and by Judah, the church which is in the good of love to the Lord; therefore, by a seed out of Jacob are signified the knowledges of good and truth, and hence those who are in them; and by the mountains, whose inheritor shall [be] out of Judah, is signified the good of love to the Lord, and thence those who are in it. By the elect who shall possess the mountain, are signified those who are in good, and by the servants, those who are in truths from good.</p><p>[17] In Jeremiah:<p>"I will bring" the sons of Israel again "upon their land. Behold, I send to many fishers, who shall fish them; and I shall send to many hunters, who shall hunt them upon every mountain, and upon every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_16_15.htm">16:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_16_16.htm">16</a>).<p>The establishment of a new church is here treated of, which was represented and signified by the bringing back of the Jews from captivity out of the land of Babylon into the land of Canaan. He who does not know what is signified by fishing and hunting, by a mountain, a hill, and by the holes of the rocks, can gather nothing from these words, but what is not even understood. That a church is to be established of those who are in natural good and in spiritual good, is meant by, "I will send fishers, who shall fish them; and hunters, who shall hunt them." To gather together those who are in natural good, is meant by sending fishers who shall fish them; and to gather together those who are in spiritual good, is meant by hunters who shall hunt them; because such are meant it is also said, upon every mountain, and upon every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. By those who are upon the mountain are meant those who are in the good of love; by those who are upon the hill, those who are in the good of charity; and by those who are out of the holes of the rocks, those who are in the obscure things of truth.</p><p>[18] In Ezekiel:<p>"Ye mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branch, and yield your fruit to my people Israel, when they draw near to come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_36_8.htm">36:8</a>).<p>By the mountains of Israel are signified the goods of charity; that the truths of faith and the goods of life are thence, is signified by, "ye shall shoot forth your branch, and yield your fruit"; branch denoting the truth of faith, and fruit denoting the good of life.</p><p>[19] In Amos:<p>"Behold, the days come, that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that scattereth [the seed]; and the mountains shall drop new wine, and all the hills shall flow. And I will bring back the captivity of my people" (<a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>), where they are explained. The mountains are said to drop new wine, and the hills to flow, because by mountains is signified the good of love to the Lord, and by hills the good of charity towards the neighbour, and by new wine truths; and hence by these words, that from both those goods they shall have truths in abundance, for by the bringing back of the people from captivity, concerning which those things are said, is signified the establishment of a new church.</p><p> [20] In David:<p>Jehovah, "thy justice is as the mountains of God; thy judgments as a great abyss" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">2235</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">9857</a>.</p><p>[21] In the same:<p>Jehovah "founded the earth upon its bases; thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stand above the mountains. At thy rebuke they flee; at the voice of thy thunder they haste away. The mountains ascend, the valleys descend, unto the place which thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a boundary, they go not beyond [it]; they return not again to cover the earth. Who sendeth forth springs into the rivers, they run between the mountains. Who watereth the mountains from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_5.htm">Psalms 104:5-13</a>).<p>By these words, understood in the spiritual sense, the process of regeneration is described, or the formation of the church with man. And by, "He founded the earth upon its bases," is signified the church with man, with its boundaries, and closings. By, "Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment," is signified that they are encompassed with scientifics in the natural man, as to its interiors, where the spiritual things of the church reside; the deep signifies scientifics in general, and garment signifies scientific truths, which are encircling and clothing. By, "the waters stand above the mountains," are signified falsities upon the delights of the natural loves, which delights are in themselves evils; the mountains denote the evils of those loves, and waters denote the falsities thence. That, at "Thy rebuke they flee, at the voice of thy thunder they haste away," signifies that falsities are dissipated by truths, and evils by goods from heaven. By, "the mountains ascend, and the valleys descend, unto the place which thou hast founded for them," is signified that in the place of natural loves, and of the evils therefrom, there are inserted heavenly loves, and the goods therefrom, and in the place of falsities general truths are admitted. By, "Thou hast set a boundary, they go not beyond [it]; they return not again to cover the earth," is signified that falsities and evils are kept without, separated from truths and goods, and enclosed lest they flow in again and destroy. By, He "sendeth forth springs into the rivers, they run between the mountains," is signified that the Lord, from the truths of the Word, gives intelligence, all things of which are from the good of celestial love; by springs are signified the truths of the Word; by springs sent into rivers, is signified intelligence thence; and by, "they run between the mountains," is signified that [they are] from the goods of celestial love, mountains denoting those goods. By, "Who watereth the mountains from his chambers," is signified that all goods are by means of truths from heaven, to water being said of truths, because waters denote truths; mountains denoting the goods of love, and chambers denoting the heavens, whence they [are]. By, "the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works," is signified that from the Divine operation the church continually increases with man; the fruit of works, when said of the Lord, denotes the Divine operation, and the earth denotes the church with man, the formation of which is here treated of, and it is said to be satisfied by continual increase. These are the arcana which are hid in these words. But who can see them, unless he knows them from the internal sense, and unless he is in knowledges, in this case, unless he has knowledge concerning the internal and external man, and concerning the goods and truths that constitute the church in them?</p><p>[22] In Zechariah:<p>"I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, when, behold, four chariots going forth between the mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">6:1</a>).<p>The new church to be established among the Gentiles is treated of in this chapter, for the new temple is treated of, by which a new church is signified. By the chariots going forth between the mountains, is signified the doctrine, which was to be formed from good by means of truths; chariots signifying doctrinals, mountains the goods of love, between the mountains signifying truths from goods; for the valleys between mountains signify lower truths, which are the truths of the natural man. In order that it may be known that by mountains are signified the goods of the natural man, it is therefore said, "and the mountains were mountains of brass," brass signifying the good of the natural man.</p><p>[23] In Zechariah:<p>"Jehovah shall go forth and fight against the nations; his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, before the faces of Jerusalem from the east, and the mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, part thereof toward the east and toward the sea, [and there shall be a very] great valley; and a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and a part of it toward the south. Then shall ye flee through the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach towards Azal" (<a href="../lj/46.htm">Last Judgment 46</a>). That the Lord's advent and the judgment which then took place, are treated of in this chapter, is evident from these words in it:<p>"Then Jehovah my God shall come, [and] all the saints with thee. And in that day there shall not be light, brightness, and glittering; and it shall be one day which shall be known to Jehovah, not day nor night: for at evening time it shall be light" (verses 5-7).<p>The evening time denotes the last time of the church, when judgment takes place; then it is evening with the evil, but light with the good. When these things are first known, it is evident afterwards by the spiritual sense, what the particulars therein signify, namely, by, "Jehovah shall go forth and fight against the nations," is signified the Last Judgment upon the evil; to go forth and fight denoting to execute judgment, and the nations denoting the evil. By, "His feet shall stand upon the mount of Olives, before the faces of Jerusalem from the east," is signified that [this is effected] from the Divine love by means of Divine truths proceeding from His Divine good. For the mount of Olives, when said of the Lord, signifies the Divine love; Jerusalem, the church as to truths, and thence the Divine truths of the church; and the east, the Divine good. By, "the mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, part thereof toward the east and toward the sea, [and there shall be a very] great valley," is signified the separation of those who are in good from those who are in evil; for, as has been said, the mount of Olives denotes the Divine love; the east denotes where those who are in the Divine good [dwell]; and the sea denotes where those who are in evil are, for the sea in the western quarter of the spiritual world separates. By, "part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and part of it toward the south," is signified the separation of those who are in the falsities of evil from those who are in the truths of good; the north denotes where those are who are in the falsities of evil, because in darkness, and the south where those are who are in the truths of good, because in the light. By, "then shall ye flee through the valley of my mountains," is signified, that then those who are in truths from good shall be rescued; to flee signifying to be rescued; the valley of the mountains signifying where those are who are in the knowledges of truth, and thence in truths from good; for those who are in the knowledges of truth dwell in valleys, and those who are in good upon mountains. "For the valley of the mountains shall reach even unto Azal," signifies separation from the falsities of evil; for Azal signifies separation and liberation.</p><p>[24] Because the mount of Olives, which was before Jerusalem eastward, signified the Divine love, and Jerusalem eastward the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good, as mentioned above, therefore the Lord usually abode upon that mount; as is evident in Luke:<p>Jesus "was in the day-time teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called [the mount] of Olives" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>).<p>Here also He discoursed with His disciples respecting His advent, and concerning the consummation of the age, that is concerning the Last Judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> et seq.; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a> et seq.). Thence also He went to Jerusalem and suffered (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_30.htm">26:30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_1.htm">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_26.htm">14:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_29.htm">Luke 19:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_37.htm">37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>) and by this was signified that He did all things from the Divine love, for the mount of Olives signified it; for whatever the Lord did in the world represented, and whatever He spoke signified. The reason why He was in representatives and significatives, when He was in the world, was that He might be in the ultimates of heaven and the church, and at the same time in their primaries, and thus might rule and dispose the ultimates from the primaries, and all intermediates from primaries by means of ultimates; representatives and significatives being in the ultimates.</p><p>[25] Because a mountain signified the good of love, and when said of the Lord, the Divine good of the Divine love, and from that good proceeds the Divine truth; therefore Jehovah, that is, the Lord, descended upon mount Sinai, and promulgated the law. For it is said that<p>He came down upon that mount, on the top of the mount (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_17.htm">24:17</a>);<p>and that there He promulgated the law (Exodus xx.). Hence also by Sinai in the Word is signified Divine truth from the Divine good, [and] also by the law there promulgated. And therefore also:<p>The Lord took Peter, James, and John into a high mountain, when He was transfigured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2</a>);<p>and when He was transfigured, He appeared in the Divine truth from the Divine good; for His face, which [shone] as the sun, represented the Divine good, and His raiment, which was as the light, the Divine truth; and Moses and Elias, who appeared, signified the Word, which is Divine truth from the Divine good.</p><p>[26] Because a mountain signified the good of love, and, in the highest sense, the Divine good, and from the Divine good proceeds the Divine truth, therefore mount Zion was situated above Jerusalem; and by mount Zion in the Word is signified the church which is in the good of love to the Lord, and by Jerusalem the church which is in truths from that good, or the church as to doctrine. Therefore, Jerusalem is also called a mountain and a hill of holiness, for by a mountain of holiness is signified spiritual good, which in its essence is truth from good, similarly also by hill, as is evident in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"It shall come to pass in the days that come after, that the mountain of Jehovah shall be on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; whence all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_2.htm">2:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_3.htm">3</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they who were ready to perish shall come in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness at Jerusalem" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">27:13</a>).<p>In Joel:<p>"Blow ye the trumpet out of Zion, and cry aloud in the mountain of holiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1</a>).<p>In Daniel:<p>"Let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, the mountain of thy holiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_16.htm">9:16</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"And they shall bring all your brethren unto Jehovah, out of all nations, to Jerusalem, the mountain of my holiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">66:20</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"He that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land for a heritage, and shall inherit the mountain of my holiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_13.htm">57:13</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"In the mountain of my holiness, in the mountain of the height of Israel, all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve me; there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_40.htm">20:40</a>).<p>In Micah:<p>In the end of the days the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and the people shall flow unto it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_4_1.htm">4:1</a>).<p>Besides many other passages elsewhere, in which the mountain of holiness, mount Zion, and the mountain of Jehovah are mentioned;<p>The mountain of holiness, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>;

he set me upon a very high mountain, upon which was as the building of a city on the south" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>).<p>Much is said on this subject in the chapters which follow. In David:<p>"Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness; beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. God is known in her palaces as a refuge" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_48_1.htm">Psalms 48:1-3</a>).<p>By these words is described the worship of the Lord from truths which are from good. The worship of Him from spiritual truths and goods, and the pleasure of the soul thence, is signified by, "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness; beautiful for situation." Worship is meant by, "to be great, and to be greatly praised"; spiritual truth, which is from spiritual good, by, "in the city of our God, the mountain of his holiness"; and the pleasure of the soul thence, by, "beautiful for situation." The worship of the Lord from celestial goods and truths is described by, "the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King." Worship from celestial good is meant by, the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion, and truths from that good are meant by, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King; the sides of the north denoting truths from celestial good, and the city of the great King denoting the doctrine of truth thence. That truths are inscribed in those who are in celestial good, is signified by, "God is known in her palaces." The reason why the sides of the north signify truths from celestial good, is, because those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom dwell in the east in heaven; and those who are in truths from that good, towards the north there.</p><p>[28] In Isaiah:<p>O Lucifer, "thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend the heavens; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit on the mount of the assembly, on the sides of the north" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_12.htm">14:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_13.htm">13</a>).<p>By Lucifer is meant Babylon, as is evident from what precedes and follows in this chapter; his love of ruling over heaven and the church, is described by his ascending the heavens, and exalting his throne above the stars of God; by which is meant the love of dominion over those heavens that constitute the Lord's spiritual kingdom, for truths and the knowledges of truth with them appear as stars. And by his sitting on the mount of the assembly, on the sides of the north, is signified [the love of dominion] over the heavens which constitute the Lord's celestial kingdom; for the mount of the assembly, and the sides of the north, denote the goods and truths there, as said above. Because mount Zion and Jerusalem were built as much as possible according to the form of heaven, it is evident what is signified by the words adduced above from David:<p>"Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King";<p>and by the words in Isaiah:<p>"The mount of the assembly, on the sides of the north."</p><p>[29] In Isaiah:<p>"Sennacherib the king of Assyria said, By the multitude of my chariots I will come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; where I will cut down the height of the cedars thereof, the choice of the fir-trees thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_24.htm">37:24</a>).<p>By these words, in the internal sense, is described the haughtiness of those who, by reasonings from falsities, are desirous of destroying the goods and truths of the church. The king of Assyria signifies the Rational perverted. The multitude of his chariots signifies reasonings from falsities of doctrine; to come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and to cut down the height of its cedars, and the choice of its fir-trees, signifies the endeavour to destroy the goods and truths of the church as well internal as external. The mountains denote the goods of the church, the sides of Lebanon denote where those are conjoined with truths, Lebanon denoting the spiritual church, and the cedars denoting the internal truths thereof, which are from good, and the fir-trees denoting the external truths thereof, also from good. These are the things meant by those words in the spiritual sense, consequently, in heaven.</p><p>[30] A mountain and mountains also signify the goods of love and charity in the following passages. In David:<p>Jehovah "who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_8.htm">Psalms 147:8</a>).<p>By the clouds, with which Jehovah covereth the heavens, are signified external truths, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; for those that are in that sense are, in the Word, called clouds, and those that are in the internal sense, [are called] glory. By the heavens are meant internal truths, because those who are in the heavens are in those [truths]. By the rain which He prepares for the earth, is signified the influx of truth, the earth denoting the church, and thence those therein who receive the truth, for the church consists of such. By the mountains on which He maketh grass to grow, are signified the goods of love, and thence those who are in the goods of love. Grass signifies the spiritual nourishment which they have; for grass is meant for beasts, and beasts signify the good affections of the natural man.</p><p>[31] In Moses:<p>Of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be "Joseph's land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the abyss lying beneath; for the first-fruits of the mountains of the east, and for the precious things of the hills of an age" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-15</a>).<p>This is Joseph's blessing by Moses - or of the tribe named from Joseph - and this blessing was pronounced upon him, because by Joseph is signified the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the heaven, there which next communicates with the Lord's celestial kingdom. By the land of Joseph is meant that heaven, and also the church that consists of those who will be in that heaven. By the precious things of heaven, by the dew, and the abyss lying beneath, are signified Divine-spiritual and spiritual-natural things, from a celestial origin; by the precious things of heaven, Divine-spiritual things; by the dew, spiritual things communicating; and by the abyss lying beneath, spiritual-natural things. By the first-fruits of the mountains of the east, and the precious things of the hills of an age, are signified genuine goods, both those of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbour; the mountains of the east denoting the goods of love to the Lord; first-fruits denoting genuine goods, and the hills of an age the goods of charity towards the neighbour. Those who do not know what is represented by Joseph and by his tribe, and besides that, what [is signified] by dew, the abyss lying beneath, the mountains of the east, and the hills of an age, can perceive scarcely anything of what such words involve, and generally can scarcely perceive the signification of anything of all those things said by Moses in that whole chapter concerning the tribes of Israel, and by the father Israel, in Gen. xlix.</p><p>[32] In Matthew:<p>"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a mountain cannot be hid" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_14.htm">5:14</a>).<p>This was [addressed] to the disciples, by whom the church is meant that is in truths from good; therefore it is said, ye are the light of the world; the light of the world denoting the truth of the church. That it is not [truth] unless it is from good, is signified "by a city which is set on a mountain cannot be hid," a city on a mountain denoting truth from good.</p><p>[33] In the same:<p>"If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, will he not leave the ninety and nine on the mountains, and going seek that which is gone astray?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_12.htm">18:12</a>).<p>It is said, "will he not leave the ninety and nine on the mountains?" for by sheep on the mountains are signified those who are in the good of love and charity; but by the one that is gone astray, is signified one who is not in that [good], because in falsities from ignorance; for where falsity is, there good is not, because good is of truth.</p><p>[34] In the Evangelists:<p>"When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, then let him that is in Judea flee to the mountains; and let him that is on the roof not go down into the house" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_14.htm">Mark 13:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_21.htm">Luke 21:21</a>).<p>In those chapters is described the successive vastation of the church by the Lord, but it is described by pure correspondences. "When ye shall see the abomination of desolation," signifies, when the disciples, that is, those who are in truths from good, perceive the church to be devastated, which takes place when there is no longer any truth because there is no good, or no faith because no charity. "Then let him that is in Judea flee to the mountains," signifies that those who are of the Lord's church should remain in the good of love; Judea signifying the Lord's church; and mountains, the goods of love; to flee to them denoting to remain therein. "Let him that is on the roof not go down into the house," signifies that he who is in genuine truths should abide therein, a house signifying the man as to all interior things of his mind, and hence the roof signifies intelligence from genuine truths, thus also the genuine truths by which intelligence [is formed in man]. Unless the spiritual sense illuminated the particulars which the Lord spake in these chapters of the Evangelists, scarcely anything contained therein would be known, thus what, "let not him that is on the roof go down into the house," may mean; and elsewhere, "let not him that is in the field return back to take his garments with" many other passages.</p><p>[35] Hitherto it has been shown, that mountains in the Word signify the goods of love; and because most things in the Word have also the opposite sense, so also mountains, which, in that sense, signify the evils of the love, or the evils which flow forth from the loves of self and of the world. Mountains are mentioned in this sense in the following passages in the Word.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"The day of Jehovah of hosts shall come upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_12.htm">2:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_14.htm">14</a>).<p>By the day of Jehovah of hosts is meant the Last Judgment, when the evil are cast down from the mountains and hills which they occupied in the spiritual world, as described in the beginning of this article; and because such dwelt upon mountains and hills before the Last Judgment, therefore by mountains and hills are meant the loves and the evils thence, in which they were; by mountains, the evils of the love of self; and by hills, the evils of the love of the world. It should be known, that all those who are in the love of self, especially those who are in the love of ruling, when they come into the spiritual world, have the greatest desire to attain high places, this being inherent in that love; whence also it has come to be said in common speech, "To be of a high and lofty mind," and "To aspire after high things." The real reason why there is such a desire in the love of ruling, is, that they wish to make themselves gods, and God is in the highest. That mountains and hills signify those loves and thence the evil thereof, is evident, for it is said, the day of Jehovah of hosts shall come upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up. What otherwise would be the object of His coming upon the mountains and hills'?</p><p>[36] In the same:<p>"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">40:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_4.htm">4</a>).<p>Here also the Lord's advent and the Last Judgment at that time are treated of. And by, "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah," and "a highway for our God," is signified that they should prepare themselves to receive the Lord; the wilderness signifies where there is no good, because no truth, thus where there is as yet no church. By, "every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low," is signified that all the humble in heart, who are those that are in goods and truths, shall be received, for those who are received by the Lord are raised up to heaven; and by, "every mountain and hill shall be made low," is signified that all those who are lofty in mind, these being those that are in the love of self and the world, shall be put down.</p><p>[37] In Ezekiel:<p>"For I will give the land to desolation and wasteness, that the pomp of strength may cease; and the mountains of Israel are desolate, that none pass through" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_33_28.htm">33:28</a>).<p>The desolation and vastation of the spiritual church, which the Israelites represented, are described by these words; for the Jews represented the Lord's celestial kingdom, or the celestial church, but the Israelites the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the spiritual church. The desolation and vastation of the latter signify the last state of the former church, which was when there was no longer any truth because no good, or, when there was no faith because no charity; desolation is said of truth which is of faith; and wasteness, of good which is of charity. The boasting and loftiness of mind from falsities which they declare to be truths, is signified by "the pomp of strength," strength and power being said of truths from good, because such possess all strength and all power; here, however, [they are said] of falsities, because from boasting and loftiness of mind. That there is no longer any good of charity and faith, is signified by, "the mountains of Israel are desolated." That there was no longer any good but [what was] altogether evil, is signified by that none pass through."</p><p>[38] In the same:<p>"Son of man, set thy faces toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovih; Thus said the Lord Jehovih to the mountains and to the hills, to the channels and to the valleys; Behold I will bring a sword upon you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_6_2.htm">6:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_6_3.htm">3</a>).<p>Here, also, by the mountains of Israel are signified the, evils proceeding from the love of self and of the world, which exist with those who are in the spiritual church, when they no longer possess any good of life, but evil of life and the falsity of doctrine thence. By mountains, hills, channels, and valleys, are signified all things of the church, both the interior or spiritual and the exterior or natural. The mountains and hills signify things interior or spiritual; the channels and valleys things exterior or natural; that they should perish by falsities, is signified by, "Behold I will bring a sword upon you." A sword denotes the destruction of falsity by truths, but in an opposite sense, as here, the destruction of truth by falsities.</p><p>[39] In the same:<p>"In the day in which Gog shall come upon the land of Israel, the fishes of the sea shall tremble before me, and the bird of the heavens, and the wild beast of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man who is upon the faces of the earth, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steps shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground; then I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains" (<a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>), where they are explained, namely, the signification of Gog, the fishes of the sea, the bird of the heavens, the wild beast of the field, the creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; and that by the mountains of Israel are signified the goods of spiritual love, but here the evils of the love [that are] opposed to those goods.</p><p>[40] In Micah:<p>"Arise, contend thou with the mountains, that the hills may hear thy voice. Hear, O ye mountains, the controversy of Jehovah, and ye strong foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_1.htm">6:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_2.htm">2</a>).<p>These things also are spoken of the spiritual church, which the Israelites separated from the Jews, represented; and by mountains are meant the goods of charity, and by hills the goods of faith; here, however, the evils and falsities opposed to those goods; therefore it is said, "contend thou with the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice." The strong foundations of the earth denote the principles of falsity in that church, the earth denoting the church, and foundations denoting the principles upon which the other things are founded. It is said, with His people, with Israel, because by people are meant those who are in truths, and those who are in falsities; and by Israel, those who are in goods, and those who are in evils.</p><p>[41] In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, destroying the whole earth; and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a mountain of burning" (<a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>), where the particulars are explained; and that the mountains and hills here denote the evils of the love of self and of the world.</p><p>[42] In Micah:<p>"Jehovah going forth out of his place, will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. And the mountains are melted under him, and the valleys are cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters poured down a steep place; on account of the transgressions of Jacob is all this, and on account of the sins of the house of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_3.htm">1:3-5</a>).<p>These things are also said of the Last Judgment, and of those who then made to themselves a resemblance of heaven upon mountains and hills, concerning whom we have frequently treated above. The Last Judgment is meant by, "Jehovah going forth out of His place, will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth"; upon the high places of the earth signifying upon those who are in high places, namely, those upon whom judgment is accomplished; for in the spiritual world there are earths, mountains, hills, and valleys, just as in the natural world. The destruction of those who are upon the mountains and in the valleys, these being those who are in evils from the love of self and of the world, and in the falsities thence, is signified by, "the mountains are melted under him, and the valleys are cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a steep place"; mountains signifying the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and valleys the falsities thence. Concerning the evils of the loves of self and of the world signified by mountains, it is said that they are melted as wax before the fire, because fire signifies those loves; and concerning the falsities signified by valleys, it is said as waters poured down a steep place, because waters signify falsities.</p><p>[43] That this is on account of evils and falsities, is clear, for it is said, "on account of the transgressions of Jacob is all this, and on account of the sins of the house of Israel."<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"I looked to the earth, and, lo, it was empty and void; and towards the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills were overturned. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and every bird of the heaven had fled" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_23.htm">4:23-25</a>).<p>By the trembling of the mountains is signified the destruction of those who are in the evils of the love of self, and by the overturning of the hills, the destruction of those who are in the evils of the love of the world, and in falsities; the other particulars may be seen explained above (n. 280, and 304).<p>In Isaiah:<p>O Jehovah, "that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down before thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_64_1.htm">64:1</a>).<p>These words signify the same as those explained above on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_3.htm">Micah 1:3-5</a>.</p><p>[44] In David:<p>"Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke. Cast forth lightning and scatter them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_5.htm">Psalms 144:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_6.htm">6</a>).<p>By, to bow the heavens and come down, is signified the same as above, by rending the heavens and coming down, by going forth out of His place, to come down and tread upon the high places of the earth, namely, to visit and judge. By, to touch the mountains that they may smoke, is signified by His presence to destroy those who are in the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and in the falsities thence; to smoke signifies to be let into the evils of those loves and into their falsities, for fire signifies those loves, and smoke their falsities. By, cast forth lightning, and scatter them, is signified the Divine truth, by which they are dissipated, for by the presence of the Divine truth evils and falsities are discovered, and by the collision at the time, they appear as lightnings.</p><p>[45] In Moses:<p>"A fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth and her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains" (<a href="../ae/301.htm">301</a>, and also what is signified by the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the seas, and, the mountains shall tremble in pride, namely, the evils of the loves of self and of the world, shall dazzle according to their increase.</p><p>[46] In Isaiah:<p>The anger of Jehovah is against all nations, and wrath upon all their army: he hath devoted them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter, so that their slain shall be cast out, and the stink of their carcases shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_34_2.htm">34:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_34_3.htm">3</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the Last Judgement; and by the anger of Jehovah against all nations, and by His wrath against all their army, is signified the destruction and damnation of all who are in evils and the falsities thence. That such as are in these shall be accursed and perish, is signified by, "He hath devoted them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter." The damnation of those who would perish by falsities is signified by, "their slain shall be cast out," slain, in the Word, being said of those who have perished by falsities, and to be cast out signifying to be damned. The damnation of those who would perish by evils is signified by, "the stink of their carcases shall come up"; carcases, in the Word, being said of those who have perished by evils, and stink signifying their damnation. "The mountains shall be melted with their blood," signifies that the evils of the loves with those have reference to falsities; mountains denoting the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and blood denoting falsity.</p><p>[47] In the same:<p>"I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herb; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_15.htm">42:15</a>).<p>By making waste the mountains and hills, is signified to destroy all the good of love to the Lord and towards the neighbour; by drying up all the herb, is signified thence to destroy all truths, herb signifying truths springing from good. By making the rivers islands, and drying up the pools, is signified to annihilate all understanding and perception of truth; rivers, signifying intelligence which is of truth; islands, where there is no intelligence, pools signifying the perception of truth; the understanding of truth is from the light of truth, but the perception of truth is from the heat or love of truth.</p><p>[48] In the same:<p>"Behold, Jacob, I will make thee a new threshing instrument having sharp teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff. Thou shalt fan them, that the wind may carry them away, and the whirlwind scatter them" (<a href="../ae/374.htm">374</a>, <a href="../ae/375.htm">375</a>); also that it would here bruise and break evils and falsities, therefore it is said, "a threshing instrument having sharp teeth," that thou mayest thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and that thou mayest make the hills as chaff, by which is signified the destruction of the evils arising from the love of self and of the world, and also of the falsities hence. And it is also said, thou shalt fan them, that the wind may carry them away, and the whirlwind scatter them, by which is signified that they shall be of no account. The wind and whirlwind are both mentioned, because evils and falsities are meant; for the wind is said of truths, and in an opposite sense of falsities, and a whirlwind of the evils of falsity.</p><p>[49] In the same:<p>"The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my mercy shall not depart from thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_10.htm">54:10</a>).<p>By the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, is not meant that the mountains and hills in the world would depart and be removed, but those who are in evil loves, and in the falsities thence; for the Gentiles from whom a new church is to be formed are treated of in this chapter, therefore by the mountains and hills are specifically meant those of the former church, consequently the Jews, with whom were mere evils of falsity and falsities of evil, because they were in the loves of self and of the world.</p><p>[50] In Jeremiah:<p>"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are wasted that no man passeth through them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_10.htm">9:10</a>).<p>The mountains, over which there is weeping and lamentation, denote evils of every kind flowing forth from the two loves above-mentioned; and by the habitations of the wilderness are signified the falsities thence; for by the wilderness is signified, where there is no good because no truth; and by habitations, where these are; here, therefore, the habitations of the wilderness denote falsities from the evils before mentioned; there being no good and truth at all is meant by their being wasted, that no man passeth through them. It is usually said in the Word, where vastation is treated of, that no man passeth through, and thereby is signified that there is no longer any truth, and, consequently, no intelligence. That they are not mountains and habitations of the wilderness that are here meant, and over which there are weeping and lamenting, is evident.</p><p>[51] In the same:<p>"My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray, the mountains have turned away; they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_6.htm">50:6</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"My sheep wander upon all the mountains, and upon every high hill; my sheep are scattered over all the faces of the earth, and there is none to search or to seek" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_6.htm">34:6</a>).<p>That the sheep have gone from mountain to hill, and that they wander upon all the mountains and upon every high hill, signifies that they seek goods and truths, but do not find them, and that instead thereof they seize upon evils and falsities. That the mountains have turned away, signifies that instead of goods there are evils.</p><p>[52] In Jeremiah:<p>"Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight" (<a href="../ae/65.htm">65</a>, <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>; and in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2162.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2162</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4938.htm">4938-4952</a>.)</p><p>[53] In the Evangelists:<p>Jesus saith unto his disciples, "Have the faith of God; verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto a mountain, Be thou removed, and cast thyself into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; those things which he said shall be accomplished for him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>).<p>He who does not know the arcana of heaven, and the spiritual sense of the Word, may suppose that the Lord spoke these words, not concerning saving faith, but concerning some other faith, which they call historical and miraculous; but the Lord spoke them of saving faith, which faith makes one with charity, and all [such faith] being from the Lord, therefore the Lord calls this faith the faith of God. And because the Lord by this faith, which is the faith of charity from Him, removes all the evils flowing from the loves of self and of the world, and casts them into hell whence they originate, therefore He says, [whosoever] shall say unto a mountain, "Be thou removed, and cast thyself into the sea"; for by a mountain are signified the evils of those loves, and by the sea is signified hell. Hence, by saying to a mountain, "Be thou removed," is signified the removal of those things, and by being cast into the sea, is signified to be cast down into hell whence they originate. From such signification of a mountain and of the sea, this became a common expression amongst the ancients, when the power of faith was the subject of discourse; not that the mountains on the earth could thereby be cast into the sea, but that evils from hell could. The mountains also in the spiritual world, upon which the evil dwell, are usually overturned and cast down by faith from the Lord; for when the evils with them are cast down, the mountains also upon which they dwell are cast down, as has been said above many times, and also often seen by me. That no other faith but the faith of charity from the Lord is here meant, is evident from the continuation of the Lord's discourse in Mark, where it is said:<p>"Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever which praying ye ask, believe that ye will receive, then shall it be done unto you. But when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any, that your Father also who is in the heavens, may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the heavens, forgive your trespasses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_24.htm">11:24-26</a>).<p>From these words it is evident that the faith of God, of which the Lord here speaks, is the faith of charity, that is, the faith that forms one with charity, and, consequently, which is all from the Lord. The Lord, besides, spoke those things to the disciples when they supposed that they could do miracles from their own faith, thus from themselves, when yet such things are done by faith from the Lord, thus by the Lord, as is also evident in Matthew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_19.htm">17:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_20.htm">20</a>), where similar things are said.</p><p>[54] Because mountains signified the goods of celestial love, and hills, the goods of spiritual love, therefore the ancients, with whom the church was representative, had their Divine worship upon mountains and hills, and therefore Zion was upon a mountain, and Jerusalem upon mountainous places below it. Lest, therefore, the Jews and Israelites, who were given to idolatry, should turn Divine worship into idolatrous worship, it was commanded them that they should perform worship in Jerusalem only, and not elsewhere; but because they were idolaters in heart, they were not content to perform worship in Jerusalem, but, according to the custom of the nations, derived from the ancients, they everywhere performed worship upon mountains and hills, and sacrificed and burnt incense thereon; wherefore because this was idolatrous with them, by their worship upon other mountains and hills is signified worship from evils and falsities; as in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to sacrifice sacrifices" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_7.htm">57:7</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Estranged Israel is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_3_6.htm">3:6</a>).<p>By playing the harlot is signified to falsify worship; that this was idolatrous, is evident from these words in Moses:<p>"Ye shall destroy the places, wherein the nations served their gods, upon the mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_12_2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>).<p>In these passages, therefore, by worship upon mountains and hills is signified worship from evils and falsities. From this, also, it came that the Gentiles in Greece fixed Helicon on a high mountain, and Parnassus on a hill below it, and believed that the gods and their goddesses dwelt there; this was derived from the ancients in Asia, and especially in the land of Canaan, not remote thence, with whom all worship consisted of representatives.</p><p>[55] It is said in the Evangelists that:<p>the devil took Jesus up into a high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory, and he tempted him there (<a href="../njhd/201.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 201</a>, <a href="../njhd/293.htm">293</a>, <a href="../njhd/302.htm">302</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 405</h4><p>405. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places, signifies that every good of love and every truth of faith perished. This is evident from the signification of "a mountain," as being the good of love to the Lord (of which presently); from the signification of "island" as being the truth of faith (of which in the next article); and from the signification of "to be moved out of their places," as being to be taken away and to perish, since the good of love and the truth of faith are meant, for when these are moved out of their places, then evils and falsities take their place, and through evils and falsities goods and truths perish. "Mountain" signifies the good of love, because in heaven those who are in the good of love to the Lord, dwell upon mountains, and those who are in charity towards the neighbor dwell upon hills; or, what is the same, those who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom dwell upon mountains, and those who are of His spiritual kingdom dwell upon hills; and the celestial kingdom is distinguished from the spiritual kingdom in this, that those who are of the celestial kingdom are in love to the Lord, and those who are of the spiritual kingdom are in charity towards the neighbor (but of the latter and the former, see in the work on <a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>). This is why "mountain" signifies the good of love to the Lord.</p><p>[2] The good of love to the Lord is meant in an abstract sense by "mountain," because all things in the internal sense of the Word are spiritual, and spiritual things must be understood in a sense abstracted from persons and places; consequently, because angels are spiritual they think and speak abstractedly from these, and thereby have intelligence and wisdom; for the idea of persons and places limits the thought, since it confines it to persons and places, and thus limits it. This idea of thought is proper to the natural, while the idea abstracted from persons and places extends itself into heaven in every direction, and is no otherwise limited than the sight of the eye is limited when it looks up into the sky without intervening objects; such an idea is proper to the spiritual. This is why "a mountain" in the spiritual sense of the Word signifies the good of love. It is similar with the signification of "the earth," as being the church; for thought abstracted from places, and from nations and peoples upon the earth, is thought respecting the church there or with these; this, therefore, is signified by "earth" in the Word. It is similar with the other things that are mentioned in the natural sense of the Word, as with hills, rocks, valleys, rivers, seas, cities, houses, gardens, woods, and other things.</p><p>[3] That "mountain" signifies the love to the Lord, and thus all good that is from that, which is called celestial good, and in the contrary sense signifies the love of self, and thus all the evil that is from that, is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Amos:<p>Dispose thyself towards thy God, O Israel; for lo, He is the Former of the mountains, and the Creator of the spirit, and declareth unto man what is his thought (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_12.htm">Amos 4:12-13</a>).<p>God is here called "the Former of the mountains" because "mountains" signify the goods of love, and "the Creator of the spirit" because "spirit" signifies life from such goods; and because through these He gives intelligence to man it is added, "and declareth unto man what is his thought," for the intelligence that man has is of his thought, which flows in from the Lord through the good of love into his life, so "to declare" here means to flow in.</p><p>[4] In David:<p>God who maketh firm the mountains by His power; He is girded with might (<a href="../hh/228.htm">Heaven and Hell 228-233</a>; and above, n. <a href="../ae/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>; and that might in reference to the Lord is omnipotence, see above, n. <a href="../ae/338.htm">338</a>)</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>I lift up mine eyes to the mountains, whence cometh help (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_121_1.htm">Psalms 121:1</a>).<p>"Mountains" here mean the heavens; and as in the heavens those who are in the goods of love and of charity dwell upon the mountains and hills, as was said above, and the Lord is in these goods, "to lift up the eyes to the mountains" also means to the Lord, from whom is all help. When "mountains," in the plural, are mentioned, both mountains and hills are meant, consequently both the good of love to the Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbor.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>There shall be upon every high mountain and upon every lofty hill streams, rivulets of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers shall fall (<a href="../lj/56.htm">The Last Judgment 56</a>) sm (<a href="../lj/58.htm">The Last Judgment 58</a>) all work on <a href="../lj/56.htm">The Last Judgment 56</a>, <a href="../lj/58.htm">58</a>). That such then as are in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor are raised up into heaven and imbued with intelligence and wisdom, is meant by "there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every lofty hill streams, rivulets of waters;" "the high mountain" signifying where those are who are in love to the Lord, and "lofty hill" where those are who are in charity towards the neighbor; "streams" wisdom, and "rivulets of waters" intelligence, for "waters" mean truths, from which are intelligence and wisdom.</p><p>[7] In Joel:<p>It shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters (<a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>)</p><p>[8] In Nahum:<p>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings, [that publisheth] peace (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>How joyous [upon the mountains] are the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings, that maketh peace to be heard; that saith unto Zion, Thy king <sup>1</sup>reigneth (<a href="../ae/365.htm">365</a>); and "O Zion, that proclaimest good tidings," means the church that is in the good of love to the Lord; and "O Jerusalem, that proclaimest good tidings," the church that is thence in truths of doctrine from the Word.</p><p>[9] In Isaiah:<p>I will make all My mountains for a way, and My highways shall be exalted. Sing aloud O heavens, and exult O earth, and break forth with singing aloud O mountains; for Jehovah hath comforted His people (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_13.htm">13</a>).<p>"Mountains," in the plural, mean both mountains and hills, thus both the good of love and the good of charity. "Mountains and hills shall be made for a way, and highways shall be exalted" signifies that those who are in these goods shall be in genuine truths; "to be made for a way" signifying to be in truths, and "highways being exalted" signifying to be in genuine truths; for "ways and highways" signify truths, which are said to be exalted by good, and the truths that are from good are genuine truths. Their joy of heart on this account is signified by "Sing aloud O heavens, exult O earth," internal joy by "Sing aloud O heavens," and external joy by "exult O earth." Confessions from joy originating in the good of love are signified by "break forth with singing aloud O mountains;" that this is on account of reformation and regeneration is signified by "for Jehovah hath comforted his people." Evidently mountains in the world are not here meant; for why should mountains be made for a way, and highways be exalted, and mountains resound with singing aloud?</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Sing aloud ye heavens, shout ye lower parts of the earth, break forth with singing aloud, ye mountains, O forest and every tree therein; for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath shown Himself glorious in Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>).<p>"Sing aloud ye heavens, shout ye lower parts of the earth, break forth with singing aloud ye mountains," has a like signification as just above; but here "mountains" signify the goods of charity; therefore it is also said, "O forest and every tree therein," for "a forest" means the external or natural man in respect to all things thereof, and "every tree" means the cognizing and knowing faculty therein; the reformation of these is signified by "Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath shown Himself glorious in Israel;" "Jacob and Israel" meaning the church external and internal; thus the external and internal with those in whom the church is.</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>The mountains and hills shall break forth with singing aloud, and all the trees of the field shall clap the hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_55_12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>).<p>In David:<p>Praise Jehovah, mountains and hills, tree of fruit, and all cedars (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_9.htm">9</a>).<p>This describes the joy of heart from the good of love and charity; and "mountains," "hills," "trees," and "cedars," are said "to break forth with singing aloud," "to clap the hand," and "to praise," because these signify the goods and truths that cause joys in man; for man does not rejoice from himself, but from the goods and truths that are with him; these rejoice because they make joy for man.</p><p>[12] In Isaiah:<p>The wilderness and its cities shall lift up their voice, and the villages that Arabia doth inhabit; the inhabitants of the cliff shall sing aloud, they shall shout from the top of the mountains (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>).<p>"The wilderness" signifies the obscurity of truth; "its cities" signify doctrinals; "villages" the natural cognitions and knowledges; "Arabia" the natural man, for "an Arabian in the wilderness" means the natural man; "the inhabitants of the cliff" signify the goods of faith, or those who are in the goods of faith; "the top of the mountains" signifies the good of love to the Lord. This makes clear what the particulars signify in their order, namely, confession and joyful worship from the good of love in such things as are mentioned; for "to shout from the top of the mountains" means to worship from the good of love.</p><p>[13] In David:<p>A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is the mountain of Bashan; why leap ye, ye mountains, ye hills of the mountain? God desireth to dwell in it; yea, Jehovah will inhabit it perpetually (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_15.htm">Psalms 68:15-16</a>).<p>"The mountain of Bashan" signifies voluntary good, such as exists in those who are in the externals of the church; for Bashan was a region beyond Jordan, which was given as an inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh, as may be seen in Joshua (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_29.htm">Joshua 13:29-32</a>); and "Manasseh" signifies the voluntary good of the external or natural man. This voluntary good is the same as the good of love in the external man, for all good of love is of the will, and all truth therefrom is of the understanding; therefore "Ephraim," his brother, signifies the intellectual truth of that good. Because "the mountain of Bashan" signifies that good, "the hills" of that mountain signify goods in act. Because it is the will that acts-for every activity of the mind and body is from the will, as everything active of thought and speech is from the understanding, therefore the joy arising from the good of love is described and meant by "skipping" and "leaping;" this makes clear what is signified by "a mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is the mountain of Bashan; why leap ye, ye mountains, ye hills of the mountain?" Because the Lord dwells with man in his voluntary good, from which are goods in act, it is said, "God desireth to dwell in it; yea, Jehovah will inhabit it perpetually."</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>Judah became the sanctuary of Jehovah. The sea saw it and fled; the Jordan turned itself back. The mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock. What hast thou O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, that thou turnest back? ye mountains, that ye leap like rams; ye hills, like sons of the flock? Before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_114_2.htm">Psalms 114:2-8</a>).<p>This describes the departure of the sons of Israel out of Egypt; and yet without explanation by the internal sense no one can know what this signifies, as that "the mountains then leaped like rams, and the hills like the sons of the flock," likewise what is meant by "the sea saw it and fled, and the Jordan turned itself back." It shall therefore be explained. The establishment of the church, or the regeneration of the men of the church, is here meant in the internal sense, for the church that was to be established is signified by the sons of Israel, its establishment by their departure, the shaking off of evils by the passage through the sea Suph, which is said "to have fled," and the introduction into the church by the crossing of the Jordan, which is said to have "turned itself back." But for the particulars: "Judah became a sanctuary, and Israel a domain," signifies that the good of love to the Lord is the very holiness of heaven and the church, and that truth from that good is that by which there is government; for "Judah" signifies celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; "sanctuary" the very holiness of heaven and the church; "Israel" spiritual good, which is truth from that good, by which there is government, for all government pertaining to the Lord is a government of Divine truth proceeding from Divine good; "the sea saw it and fled, Jordan turned itself back," signifies that when the evils and falsities which are in the natural man had been shaken off, true knowledges [scientifica] and cognitions [cognitiones] of truth and good took their place; "the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock," signifies that celestial good, which is the good of love, and spiritual good, which is truth from that good, produce good or come into effect from joy; "mountains" signifying the good of love, "hills" the goods of charity, which in their essence are truths from that good; and "to leap," because it is predicated of these, signifies to produce good from joy. It is said "like rams," and "like the sons of the flock," because "rams" signify the goods of charity, and "the sons of the flock" truths therefrom. The establishment of the church from these, that is, the regeneration of the men of the church, is signified by, "before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters;" "earth" meaning the church; and this is said "to be in travail" when it is established or when the man of the church is born anew; it is said "before the Lord" and "before the God of Jacob," because where the good of love is treated of in the Word the Lord is called "the Lord;" and when goods in act are treated of He is called "the God of Jacob." Regeneration by truths from goods is signified by "He turned the rock into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters;" "pool of waters" signifying the knowledges of truth, and "fountain of waters" the Word from which these are, and "rock" the natural man in respect to truth before reformation, and "flint" the natural man in respect to good before reformation.</p><p>[15] In the same:<p>Thou hast caused a vine to journey out of Egypt; Thou hast driven out the nations and planted it. The mountains were covered by its shadow, and the cedars of God by its branches (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_8.htm">Psalms 80:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_10.htm">10</a>).<p>"A vine out of Egypt" signifies the spiritual church which has its beginning with man by means of knowledges and cognitions in the natural man, "vine" meaning the spiritual church, and "Egypt" the knowing faculty [scientificum] which is in the natural man; "thou hast driven out the nations, and planted it," signifies that when evils had been cast out therefrom the church was established; "nations" meaning evils, and "to plant a vine" meaning to establish the spiritual church; "the mountains were covered by its shadow, and the cedars of God by its branches," signifies that the whole church is from spiritual goods and truths; "mountains" meaning spiritual goods, and "the cedars of God" spiritual truths. Evidently the bringing forth of the sons of Israel out of Egypt and their introduction into the land of Canaan, from which the nations were expelled, is what is meant by these words; and yet the same words, in the internal sense, mean such things as have been explained; nor was anything else represented and signified by the introduction of the sons of Israel into the land of Canaan, and by the expulsion of the nations from it; for all the historical parts of the Word, as well as its prophetical parts, involve spiritual things.</p><p>[16] In Isaiah:<p>As to all mountains that shall be hoed with the hoe, there shall not come thither the fear of briar and bramble; but there shall be the sending forth of the ox and the trampling of the sheep (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_25.htm">Isaiah 7:25</a>).<p>"The mountains that shall be hoed with the hoe" mean those who do what is good from a love of good. (What the remainder signifies see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>).<p>"Jacob" and "Judah" signify the church, "Jacob" the external church, which is in the knowledges of good and truth, and "Judah" the [internal] church which is in the good of love to the Lord; therefore "a seed out of Jacob" signifies the knowledges of good and truth, and thus such as are in these; and "the mountains whose inheritor shall be out of Judah," signify the good of love to the Lord, and thence such as are in it; "the chosen who shall possess the mountain," signify those who are in good, and "the servants" those who are in truths from good.</p><p>[17] In Jeremiah:<p>I will bring the sons of Israel back upon their land. Behold, I will send to many fishers, who shall fish them; and I will send to many hunters, who shall hunt them from upon every mountain and from upon every hill and out of the holes of the cliffs (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_16_15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15-16</a>).<p>This treats of the establishment of a new church, which was represented and signified by the bringing back of the Jews from the captivity out of the land of Babylon into the land of Canaan. He who does not know what is signified by "fishing and hunting," by "mountain," "hill," and "holes of the cliffs," can gather nothing from these words that he can comprehend. That a church was to be established from those who are in natural good and in spiritual good is meant by "I will send fishers who shall fish them, and hunters who shall hunt them." To gather together those who are in natural good is meant by "sending fishers who shall fish them;" and to gather together those who are in spiritual good is meant by "sending hunters who shall hunt them;" because such are meant it is added, "from upon every mountain and from upon every hill, and out of the holes of the cliffs," those "upon a mountain" meaning those who are in the good of love, "those upon a hill" those who are in the good of charity; "and those out of the holes of the cliffs" those who are in obscurities respecting truth.</p><p>[18] In Ezekiel:<p>Ye mountains of Israel, ye shall give forth your branch, and bear your fruit to My people Israel, when they draw near to come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_36_8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8</a>).<p>"The mountains of Israel" signify the goods of charity; that from these are the truths of faith and the goods of life, is signified by "ye shall give forth your branch, and bear your fruit;" "branch" meaning the truth of faith, and "fruit" the good of life.</p><p>[19] In Amos:<p>Behold, the days come, that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall dissolve; for I will bring back the captivity of My people (<a href="../ae/376.htm">376</a>), where they are explained. "The mountains" are said "to drop sweet wine," and "the hills to dissolve," because "mountains" signify the good of love to the Lord, and "hills" the good of charity towards the neighbor, and "sweet wine" truths; therefore these words signify that from these two goods they shall have truths in abundance, for the bringing back of the people from captivity, about which this is said, signifies the establishment of a new church.</p><p>[20] In David:<p>Jehovah, Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments like a great deep (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2235</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">9857</a>.)</p><p>[21] In the same:<p>Jehovah hath founded the earth upon its bases; Thou hast covered it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stand above the mountains. At Thy rebuke they flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they hurried away. The mountains arise, the valleys sink down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound, they pass it not; they return not again to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs into the brooks, they flow between the mountains. He watereth the mountains from His upper chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Thy works (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_5.htm">Psalms 104:5-10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_13.htm">13</a>).<p>This, understood in the spiritual sense, describes the process of regeneration, or of the formation of the church with man; and "He hath founded the earth upon its bases," signifies the church with man with its boundaries and closings; "Thou hast covered it with the deep as with a vesture," signifies with knowledges [scientifica] in the natural man, by which knowledges the interiors of the natural man, where the spiritual things of the church have their seat, are encompassed; "the deep" signifying knowledges in general, and "vesture" the true knowledges encircling and investing; "the waters stand above the mountains" signifies the falsities above the delights of the natural loves, which delights are in themselves evils; "mountains" meaning the evils of those loves, and "waters" falsities therefrom; "at Thy rebuke they flee, at the voice of Thy thunder they hurry away" signifies that falsities are dispersed by truths, and evils by goods from heaven; "the mountains arise, and the valleys sink down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them" signifies that in place of natural loves and of evils therefrom there are inserted heavenly loves and goods from them, and in place of falsities general truths are let down; "Thou hast set a bound, they pass it not, they return not again to cover the earth" signifies that falsities and evils are kept without, separated from truths and goods, and held within bounds that they may not flow in again and destroy; "He sendeth forth springs into the brooks, they flow between the mountains" signifies that the Lord, out of the truths of the Word, gives intelligence, all things of which are from the good of celestial love; "springs" signifying the truths of the Word, "springs sent into brooks" the intelligence therefrom, and their "flowing between the mountains" that they are from the goods of celestial love, "mountains" meaning such goods. "He watereth the mountains from His upper chambers" signifies that all goods are by means of truths from heaven; "to water" is predicated of truths, because "waters" mean truths; "mountains" mean the goods of love; and "upper chambers" the heavens from which these are; "the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Thy works" signifies that from the Divine operation the church continually increases with man; "the fruit of works" meaning, in reference to the Lord, the Divine operation, and "the earth" the church in man, the formation of which is here treated of; and the church is said "to be satisfied" by continual increase. These are the arcana that are hid in these words; but who can see them unless he knows them from the internal sense, and unless he is in knowledges, in this case, unless he is in knowledge respecting the internal and external man, and the goods and truths that constitute the church in these?</p><p>[22] In Zechariah:<p>I lifted up mine eyes and saw, when behold, four chariots coming out from between the mountains; and the mountains were mountains of copper (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>).<p>A new church to be established among the Gentiles is treated of in this chapter, for a new temple is treated of, which signifies a new church. "Chariots coming out from between the mountains" signify doctrine, which is to be formed out of good by means of truths, "chariots" signifying doctrinals, "mountains" the goods of love, and "between mountains" truths from goods; for "valleys," which are between mountains, signify lower truths, which are the truths of the natural man. That it may be known, that "mountains" here signify the goods of the natural man, it is said, "and the mountains were mountains of copper," "copper" signifying the good of the natural man.</p><p>[23] In Zechariah:<p>Jehovah shall go forth and fight against the nations; His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, before the faces of Jerusalem from the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, a part thereof toward the east and toward the sea with a great valley, and a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and a part of it toward the south. Then shall ye flee through the valley of My mountains; and the valley of the mountains shall reach towards Azal (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_3.htm">Zechariah 14:3-5</a>).<p>This is said of the Last Judgment, which was accomplished by the Lord when He was in the world; for when the Lord was in the world He reduced all things to order in the heavens and in the hells, therefore He then wrought a judgment upon the evil and upon the good. This judgment is what is meant in the word of the Old Testament by "the day of indignation," "of anger," "of wrath," "of the vengeance of Jehovah," and by "the year of retributions" (on this judgment see the small work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_5.htm">Zechariah 14:5-7</a>).<p>"The time of evening" means the last time of the church, when judgment takes place; then it is "evening" to the evil, but "light" to the good. As soon as these things are known, it becomes plain, through the spiritual sense, what the particulars here signify, namely, "Jehovah shall go forth and fight against the nations" signifies the Last Judgment upon the evil, "to go forth and fight" means to execute judgment, and "nations" the evil; "His feet shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, before the faces of Jerusalem from the east" signifies that this is effected from the Divine love by means of Divine truths proceeding from His Divine good; "the Mount of Olives" signifying, in reference to the Lord, the Divine love, "Jerusalem," the church in respect to truths, and therefore the Divine truths of the church, and "the east" the Divine good; "the Mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, a part thereof toward the east and toward the sea, with a great valley" signifies the separation of those who are in good from those who are in evil; for "the Mount of Olives," as was said, means the Divine love; "the east" means where those are who are in Divine good, and "the sea" where those are who are in evil, for in the western quarter of the spiritual world is a sea which separates; "a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and part of it toward the south" signifies the separation of those who are in the falsities of evil from those who are in the truths of good; "the north" meaning where those are who are in the falsities of evil, since they are in darkness, and "the south" where those are who are in the truths of good, since they are in light; "then shall ye flee through the valley of my mountains" signifies that then those who are in truths from good shall be rescued, "to flee" signifying to be rescued, "the valley of the mountains" signifying where those are who are in the knowledges of truth, and thus in truths from good, for those who are in the knowledges of truth dwell in valleys, and those who are in good upon the mountains; "and the valley of the mountains shall reach even unto Azal" signifies separation from the falsities of evil, "Azal" signifying separation and liberation.</p><p>[24] Because "the Mount of Olives," which was before Jerusalem eastward, signified the Divine love, and "Jerusalem from the east" Divine truth proceeding from Divine good, as was said above, the Lord was accustomed to stay on that mount, as is evident in Luke:<p>Jesus during the days was teaching in the temple; but at night He went out and lodged in the mount that is called the Mount of Olives (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>).<p>It was here, too, that He spoke with His disciples about His coming and the consummation of the age, that is, about the Last Judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>). It was from here, also, that He went to Jerusalem and suffered (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_30.htm">26:30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_1.htm">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_26.htm">14:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_29.htm">Luke 19:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_37.htm">37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_37.htm">21:37</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>); signifying thereby that He did all things from the Divine love, for "the Mount of Olives" signified that love; for whatever the Lord did in the world was representative, and whatever He spoke was significative. The Lord when in the world was in representatives and significatives, in order that He might be in the ultimates of heaven and the church, and at the same time in their firsts, and thus might rule and dispose ultimates from firsts, and thus all intermediates from firsts through ultimates; representatives and significatives are in ultimates.</p><p>[25] Because "a mountain" signified the good of love and in reference to the Lord, the Divine good of the Divine love, from which good Divine truth proceeds, so Jehovah, that is, the Lord, descended upon Mount Sinai and promulgated the law. For it is said that:<p>He came down upon that mount, to the top of the mount (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_16.htm">24:16-17</a>);<p>And that He promulgated the law there (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_1.htm">Exodus 20</a>).<p>Therefore also Divine truth from Divine good is signified in the Word by "Sinai," and also by "the law" there promulgated. So too:<p>The Lord took Peter, James, and John into a high mountain, when He was transfigured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2</a>).<p>and when He was transfigured He appeared in Divine truth from Divine good, for "His face which was as the sun" represented the Divine good, and "His raiment which was as the light" the Divine truth; and "Moses and Elias," who appeared, signified the Word, which is Divine truth from the Divine good.</p><p>[26] Since "a mountain" signified the good of love, and in the highest sense, the Divine good, and from the Divine good Divine truth proceeds, so Mount Zion was built up above Jerusalem, and in the Word "Mount Zion" signifies the church that is in the good of love to the Lord, and "Jerusalem" the church that is in truths from that good, or the church in respect to doctrine. For the same reason Jerusalem is called "the mountain of holiness," also "the hill;" for "the mountain of holiness," likewise "hill" signify spiritual good, which in its essence is truth from good, as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>It shall come to pass in the latter end of days that the mountain of Jehovah shall be on the head of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; whence all nations shall flow unto it; and many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).<p>In the same:<p>In that day a great trumpet shall be blown, and the perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness at Jerusalem (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>).<p>In Joel:<p>Blow ye the trumpet in <sup>2</sup>Zion, and cry aloud in the mountain of holiness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>).<p>In Daniel:<p>Let thine anger and Thy wrath be turned back from Thy city Jerusalem, the mountain of Thy Holiness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_16.htm">Daniel 9:16</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>They shall bring all your brethren out of all nations unto Jehovah, unto the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>).<p>He that putteth His trust in Me shall have the land for a heritage, and shall possess as an inheritance the mountain of My holiness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>In the mountain of My holiness, in the mountain of the height of Israel, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>).<p>In Micah:<p>In the latter end of days it shall be that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and the peoples shall flow unto it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_4_1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>).<p>Besides many passages elsewhere in which "the mountain of holiness," "Mount Zion," and "the mountain of Jehovah" are mentioned:<p>The mountain of holiness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>;

he set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the building of a city on the south (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>).<p>Respecting this, much is said in the chapters that follow. In David:<p>Great is Jehovah, and to be praised exceedingly in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness; beautiful in situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. God is known in her palaces as a refuge (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_48_1.htm">Psalms 48:1-3</a>).<p>This describes the worship of the Lord from truths that are from good. The worship of Him from spiritual truths and goods and the consequent pleasure of the soul is signified by "Great is Jehovah, and to be praised exceedingly in the city of our God, in the mountain of His Holiness, beautiful for situation;" worship is meant by "to be great," and "to be praised exceedingly;" spiritual truth that is from spiritual good by "in the city of our God, the mountain of His Holiness;" and the consequent pleasure of the soul by "beautiful for situation;" the worship of the Lord from celestial goods and truths is described by "the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king;" worship from celestial good is meant by "the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion;" and truths from that good by "on the sides of the north, the city of the great King;" "the sides of the north" meaning truths from celestial good, and "the city of the great King" the doctrine of truth therefrom. That truths are inscribed on those who are in celestial good is signified by "God is known in her palaces." "The sides of the north" signify truths from celestial good, because those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom dwell in the east in heaven; and those who are in truths from that good, towards the north there.</p><p>[28] In Isaiah:<p>O Lucifer, thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into the heavens; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit on the mount of the meeting, on the sides of the north (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>).<p>"Lucifer" means Babylon, as is evident from what precedes and follows in this chapter; its love of ruling over heaven and the church is described by "I will ascend into the heavens, and will exalt my throne above the stars of God;" which means a striving for dominion over those heavens that constitute the Lord's spiritual kingdom, for truths and the knowledges of truth appear to such as stars; "I will sit on the mount of meeting, on the sides of the north" signifies a striving for dominion over the heavens that constitute the Lord's celestial kingdom, "the mount of meeting" and "the sides of the north" meaning the goods and truths there (as above). The fact that Mount Zion and Jerusalem were built as far as possible according to the form of heaven makes clear what the words cited above from David signify, "Mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the great king;" and the words from Isaiah, "The mount of meeting on the sides of the north."</p><p>[29] In Isaiah:<p>Sennacherib the king of Assyria said, By the multitude of my chariots I will come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; where I will cut down the height of its cedars, the choice of its fir trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>).<p>This describes, in the internal sense, the haughtiness of those who wish to destroy the goods and truths of the church by reasonings from falsities; "the king of Assyria" signifies the rational perverted; "the multitude of his chariots" signifies reasonings from the falsities of doctrine; "to come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and to cut down the height of its cedars, and the choice of its fir trees" signifies the endeavor to destroy the goods and truths of the church, both internal and external; "mountains" meaning the goods of the church, "the sides of Lebanon" meaning where goods are conjoined with truths, "Lebanon" the spiritual church, "cedars" its internal truths which are from good, and "fir trees" its external truths, also from good. This is the meaning of these words in the spiritual sense, consequently in heaven.</p><p>[30] "Mountain" and "mountains" signify the goods of love and of charity in the following passages also. In David:<p>Jehovah who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to spring forth upon the mountains (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_8.htm">Psalms 147:8</a>).<p>"The clouds," with which Jehovah covers the heavens, signify external truths, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; for the truths in that sense are called in the Word "clouds," while the truths in the internal sense are called "glory;" "the heavens" mean internal truths, because those who are in the heavens are in them; "the rain which he prepares for the earth" signifies influx of truth, "the earth" meaning the church, and thus those there who receive truth, for the church consists of such; "the mountains on which He makes grass to spring forth" signify the goods of love, and thence those who are in the goods of love, "grass" signifying the spiritual nourishment that such have; for grass for beasts is meant, and "beasts" signify the affections of good of the natural man.</p><p>[31] In Moses:<p>Of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be the land [of Joseph] for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that lieth beneath, for the firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and for the precious things of the hills of an age (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-15</a>).<p>This is the blessing of Joseph, or of the tribe named from Joseph by Moses; and this blessing was pronounced upon Joseph because "Joseph" signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the heaven there that most nearly communicates with the Lord's celestial kingdom; "the land of Joseph" means that heaven, and also the church that consists of those who will be in that heaven; "the precious things of heaven, the dew, and the deep that lieth beneath" signify Divine-spiritual and spiritual-natural things from a celestial origin, "the precious things of heaven" Divine-spiritual things, "the dew" spiritual things communicating, and "the deep that lieth beneath" spiritual-natural things; "the firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and the precious things of the hills of an age" signify genuine goods, both of the love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, "the mountains of the east" meaning the goods of love to the Lord, "the firstfruits" genuine goods, and "the hills of an age" the goods of charity towards the neighbor. Those who are ignorant of what is represented by "Joseph" and "his tribe," and also by "dew," "the deep that lieth beneath," "the mountains of the east," and "the hills of an age," can know scarcely anything of what such words involve, and, in general, can know scarcely anything of the significance of what is said by Moses in this whole chapter respecting the tribes of Israel, and of what is said by Israel the father in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_1.htm">Genesis 49</a>.</p><p>[32] In Matthew:<p>Ye are the light of the world; a city <sup>3</sup>that is set on a mountain cannot be hid (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>).<p>This was said to the disciples, by whom the church which is in truths from good is meant; therefore it is said, "Ye are the light of the world," "the light of the world" meaning the truth of the church. That it is not the truth unless it is from good is signified by "a city that is set on a mountain cannot be hid," "a city on a mountain" meaning truth from good.</p><p>[33] In the same:<p>If any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, will he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains, and going seek that which is gone astray? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>).<p>It is said, "will he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains?" for "sheep in the mountains" signify those who are in the good of love and charity; but "the one that is gone astray" signifies one who is not in that good, because he is in falsities from ignorance; for where falsity is, there good is not, because good is of truth.</p><p>[34] In the Gospels:<p>When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let him that is on the roof not go down into the house (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_14.htm">Mark 13:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15-17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_21.htm">Luke 21:21</a>).<p>In those chapters the Lord describes the successive vastation of the church, but it is described by pure correspondences. "When ye shall see the abomination of desolation" signifies when the disciples, that is, those who are in truths from good, perceive the church to be devastated, which takes place when there is no longer any truth because there is no good, or no faith because there is no charity; "then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains" signifies that those who are of the Lord's church are to remain in the good of love, "Judea" signifying the Lord's church, and "mountains" the goods of love; "to flee to them" means to remain in those goods; "let him that is on the roof not go down into the house" signifies that he that is in genuine truths should remain in them, "house" signifying a man in respect to all the interior things which belong to his mind, and "the roof of the house" signifying therefore the intelligence that is from genuine truths, thus also the genuine truths through which there is intelligence. Unless the particulars of what the Lord said in these chapters of the Gospels are illustrated by the spiritual sense, scarcely anything that is contained there can be known, thus when it is said "let him that is on the roof not go down into the house;" or in another place, "let not him that is in the field return back to take his garments;" and many other things.</p><p>[35] Thus far it has been shown that "mountains" signify in the Word the goods of love; but as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so do "mountains," which in that sense signify the evils of the love, or the evils that spring forth from the loves of self and the world. Mountains are mentioned in this sense in the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah:<p>The day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon everyone that is proud and exalted, and upon all the exalted mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_2_14.htm">14</a>).<p>"The day of Jehovah of Hosts" means the Last Judgment, when the evil were cast down from the mountains and hills which they occupied in the spiritual world, as was said in the beginning of this article. It is because such before the Last Judgment dwelt upon mountains and hills, that "mountains and hills" mean the loves and the evils therefrom in which they were, "mountains" the evils of the love of self, and "hills" the evils of the love of the world. It is to be known that all who are in the love of self, especially those who are in the love of ruling, when they come into the spiritual world, are in the greatest eagerness to raise themselves into high places; this desire is inherent in that love; and this is why "to be of a high or elated mind" and "to aspire to high things" have become expressions in common use. The reason itself that there is this eagerness in the love of ruling is that they wish to make themselves gods, and God is in things highest. That "mountains and hills" signify these loves, and thence the evils of these loves, is clear from its being said, "a day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon everyone that is proud and exalted, and upon all the exalted mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up;" what else could be meant by "coming upon the mountains and hills?"</p><p>[36] In the same:<p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make level a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3-4</a>).<p>This, too, treats of the Lord's coming and of the Last Judgment at that time; and "the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, and a highway for our God," signifies that they should prepare themselves to receive the Lord; "wilderness" signifying where there is no good because there is no truth, thus where there is as yet no church; "every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low" signifies that all who are humble in heart, that is, all who are in goods and truths, are received, for such as are received by the Lord are raised up to heaven; while "every mountain and hill shall be made low" signifies that all who are elated in mind, that is, who are in the love of self and the world, shall be put down.</p><p>[37] In Ezekiel:<p>For I will make the land a desolation and wasteness, that the pride of strength may cease; and the mountains of Israel have been laid waste, that none may pass through (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_33_28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>).<p>This describes the desolation and vastation of the spiritual church, which the Israelites represented; for the Jews represented the Lord's celestial kingdom, or the celestial church, while the Israelites represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the spiritual church. Its "desolation and vastation" signifies the last state of the spiritual church, which was when there was no longer any truth because there was no good, or, when there was no faith because no charity; "desolation" is predicated of truth which is of faith, and "vastation" of good which is of charity. Boasting and elation of mind from falsities that they call truths, is signified by "the pride of strength," "strength" and "power" having reference to truths from good, because all strength and all power belong to such truths; here, however, they have reference to falsities, because of the boasting and elation of mind. That there was no longer any good of charity and faith is signified by "the mountains of Israel have been laid waste;" that there was no good whatever, but only evil, is signified by "that none may pass through."</p><p>[38] In the same:<p>Son of man, set thy faces toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovih; Thus said the Lord Jehovih to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys: Behold I bring the sword upon you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_6_2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2-3</a>).<p>Here, too, "mountains of Israel" signify the evils that proceed from the love of self and of the world, which exist with those who are in the spiritual church, when they no longer have any good of life, but only evil of life and the falsity of doctrine therefrom; "mountains," "hills," "water-courses," and "valleys," signify all things of the church, both interior or spiritual and exterior or natural, "mountains and hills" signifying things interior or spiritual, "water-courses and valleys" things exterior or natural; that these will perish through falsities is signified by "Behold I will bring the sword upon you," "sword" meaning the destruction of falsity by truths, and in a contrary sense, as here, the destruction of truth by falsities.</p><p>[39] In the same:<p>In the day in which God shall come upon the ground of Israel, the fishes of the sea, and the fowl of the heavens, and the wild beast of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and every man who is upon the faces of the ground, shall quake before Me, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steps shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the earth; then I will call for the sword against him unto all My mountains (<a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>, where it is explained, namely, what is signified by "God," by "the fishes of the sea," "the fowl of the heavens," "the wild beast of the field," "the creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground;" also that "the mountains of Israel" signify the goods of spiritual love, but here, the evils of love that are opposed to those goods.</p><p>[40] In Micah:<p>Arise, strive thou with the mountains, that the hills may hear thy <sup>4</sup>voice. Hear, O ye mountains, the strife of Jehovah, and ye strong foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a strife with His people, and He reproveth Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_1.htm">Micah 6:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_2.htm">2</a>).<p>This, too, was said of the spiritual church, which was represented by the Israelites when separated from the Jews; and "mountains" mean the goods of charity, and "hills" the goods of faith; but here, the evils and falsities that are the opposites of these goods; therefore, it is said, "strive thou with the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice;" "the strong foundations of the earth" mean the principles of falsity in that church, "the earth" meaning the church, and "foundations" the principles upon which the other things are founded. It is said, "with His people," "with Israel," because "people" means those who are in truths, or those who are in falsities; and "Israel" those who are in goods, or those who are in evils.</p><p>[41] In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, destroying the whole earth; and I will stretch out the hand against thee, and roll thee down from the cliffs, and will make thee a mountain of burning (<a href="../ae/400.htm">400</a>, where the particulars are explained; showing that "mountains and hills" here mean the evils of the love of self and the world.</p><p>[42] In Micah:<p>Jehovah going forth out of His place cometh down and treadeth upon the high places of the earth. Therefore the mountains are melted under Him, and the valleys are cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a descent; on account of the transgressions of Jacob is all this, and on account of the sins of the house of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_3.htm">Micah 1:3-5</a>).<p>This, too, was said of the Last Judgment, and of those who then made for themselves a semblance of heaven upon the mountains and hills (who have been treated of above, in several places). The Last Judgment is meant by "Jehovah going forth out of His place, He cometh down and treadeth upon the high places of the earth," "upon the high places of the earth" signifying upon those who were in the high places, that is, upon whom judgment was executed, for in the spiritual world, just as in the natural world, there are lands, mountains, hills, and valleys. The destruction of those who are upon the mountains and in the valleys, who are such as are in evils from the love of self and the world and in the falsities therefrom, is signified by "the mountains are melted under Him, and the valleys are cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a descent," "mountains" signifying the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and "valleys" the falsities therefrom; of these evils of the loves of self and of the world that are signified by "mountains" it is said that they are melted "as wax before the fire," since "fire" signifies those loves; and of the falsities that are signified by "valleys" it is said "as waters poured down a descent," since "waters" signify falsities. This was evidently because of evils and falsities, for it is said, "on account of the transgressions of Jacob is all this, and on account of the sins of the house of Israel."</p><p>[43] In Jeremiah:<p>I saw the earth, and lo, it is void and empty; and towards the heavens, and they have no light. I saw the mountains, and lo, they quake, and all the hills are overturned. I saw, and lo, there is no man, and every fowl of heaven hath fled away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-25</a>).<p>"The quaking of the mountains" signifies the destruction of those who are in the evils of the love of self, and "the overturning of the hills," the destruction of those who are in the evils of the love of the world, and in falsities. (The remainder may be seen explained above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_64_1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>).<p>These words have a similar signification as those in Micah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_3.htm">1:3-5</a>) which have been explained above.</p><p>[44] In David:<p>Bow Thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down; touch the mountains that they may smoke. Flash forth the lightning and scatter them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_144_5.htm">Psalms 144:5-6</a>.<p>"To bow the heavens and come down," means the like as "to rend the heavens and come down," "to go forth out of His place, and to come down and tread upon the high places of the earth," quoted above, namely, to visit and judge; "to touch the mountains that they may smoke" signifies to destroy by His presence those who are in the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and in falsities therefrom; "to smoke" signifies to be let into the evils of these loves and into their falsities, for "fire" signifies these loves, and "smoke" their falsities; "flash forth the lightning and scatter them" signifies the Divine truth by which they are dispersed, for it is by the presence of Divine truth that evils and falsities are disclosed, and from the collision then there are appearances like lightnings.</p><p>[45] In Moses:<p>A fire hath been kindled in Mine anger, and shall burn even unto the lowest hell, and it shall devour the earth and its produce, and shall set in flames the foundations of the mountains (<a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>, where it may be seen what is signified by "the mountains are moved in the heart of the seas," and "the mountains shall quake in the uprising," namely, that the evils of the loves of self and of the world will cause distress according to their increase.</p><p>[46] In Isaiah:<p>The anger of Jehovah is against all nations, and His wrath upon all their host; He hath devoted them, He hath given them to the slaughter, that their slain may be cast forth; and the stink of their carcasses shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted by their blood (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_34_2.htm">Isaiah 34:2-3</a>).<p>This is said of the Last Judgment; and "the anger of Jehovah is against all nations, and His wrath upon all their host" signifies the destruction and damnation of all who are in evils and their falsities from purpose and from the heart; "nations" signifying these evils, and "host" all falsities therefrom. That such are to be damned and that they will perish is signified by "He hath devoted them, and hath given them to the slaughter." The damnation of those who will perish through falsities is signified by "their slain shall be cast forth;" those are said in the Word "to have been slain" who have perished through falsities; and "to be cast forth" signifies to be damned. The damnation of those who would perish by evils is signified by "the stink of their carcasses shall come up;" those are called in the Word "carcasses" who have perished by evils, and "stink" signifies their damnation; "the mountains shall be melted by their blood" signifies that evils of the loves with such are full of falsities, "mountains" meaning the evils of the loves of self and of the world, and "blood" falsity.</p><p>[47] In the same:<p>I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a>).<p>"To make waste mountains and hills" signifies to destroy all the good of love to the Lord and towards the neighbor; "to dry up every herb" signifies the consequent destruction of all truths, "herb" signifying truths springing from good; "to make the rivers islands, and to dry up the pools" signifies to annihilate all the understanding and perception of truth, "rivers" signifying intelligence which is of truth, "islands" where there is no intelligence, "pools" the perception of truth. The understanding of truth is from the light of truth, but the perception of truth is from the heat or love of truth.</p><p>[48] In the same:<p>Behold, O Jacob, I have made thee into a new threshing instrument having sharp teeth, that thou mayest thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and make the hills as chaff. Thou shalt disperse them, that the wind may carry them away and the tempest scatter them (<a href="../ae/374.htm">374-375</a>; here therefore because evils and falsities are what are to be crushed and broken up it is said "a threshing instrument having sharp teeth, that thou mayest thresh the mountains and beat them small, and make the hills as chaff," which signifies the destruction of the evils arising from the love of self and the world, and of the falsities therefrom; and it is added "thou shalt disperse them, that the wind may carry them away and the tempest scatter them," which signifies that they shall be of no account; both "wind" and "tempest" are mentioned because both evils and falsities are meant, "wind" having reference to truths, and in the contrary sense to falsities, and "tempest" to the evils of falsity.</p><p>[49] In the same:<p>The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but My mercy shall not depart from with thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>).<p>"The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed," does not mean that the mountains and hills that are on the earth are to depart and be removed, but those who are in evil loves and in falsities therefrom, for this chapter treats of the nations from which a new church is to be formed, therefore "mountains and hills" mean, in particular, those of the former church, consequently the Jews with whom were mere evils of falsity and falsities of evil, because they were in the loves of self and of the world.</p><p>[50] In Jeremiah:<p>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are laid waste so that no man passeth through (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>).<p>"The mountains" for which there is weeping and wailing, mean evils of every kind springing forth from the two loves just mentioned; and "the habitations of the wilderness" signify falsities therefrom, for "wilderness" signifies where there is no good because there is no truth, and "habitations" where falsities are; so here the "habitations of the wilderness" mean the falsities from the evils above described; that there is no good and truth whatever is meant by "they are laid waste so that no man passeth through." Where vastation is treated of in the Word, it is customary to say, "so that no man passeth through," and it signifies that there is no longer any truth, and consequently no intelligence. It is evident that it is not mountains and habitations of the wilderness for which there is weeping and wailing.</p><p>[51] In the same:<p>My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to err, the mountains have turned away; they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>My sheep go astray on all the mountains and upon every exalted hill; and My sheep were scattered upon all the faces of the earth, and there is none that enquireth or seeketh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>).<p>That "the sheep have gone from mountain to hill," and that "they go astray on all the mountains and upon every exalted hill" signifies that they seek goods and truths, but do not find them, but that evils and falsities are seized upon instead. "The mountains have turned away" signifies that instead of goods there are evils.</p><p>[52] In Jeremiah:<p>Give glory to Jehovah your <sup>5</sup>God, before He cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight (<a href="../ae/65.htm">65</a>, <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2162.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2162</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4938.htm">4938-4952</a>)</p><p>[53] In the Gospels:<p>Jesus saith unto the disciples, Have the faith of God; verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto [this] mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, what he hath said shall be done for him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_22.htm">Mark 11:22-23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>).<p>One who is ignorant of the arcana of heaven and of the spiritual sense of the Word, might believe that the Lord said this, not of saving faith, but of another faith that is called historical and miraculous; but the Lord said this of saving faith, which faith makes one with charity and is wholly from the Lord, therefore the Lord calls this faith "the faith of God;" and because it is by this faith, which is the faith of charity from Him, that the Lord removes all evils flowing from the loves of self and of the world and casts them into hell from which they came, so He says, "Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, what he hath said shall he done;" for "mountain" signifies the evils of those loves, and "sea" signifies hell; therefore "to say to a mountain, Be thou taken up," signifies the removal of those evils, and "to be cast into the sea" signifies to be cast into the hell from which they came. Because of this signification of "mountain" and "sea," this came to be a common expression with the ancients when the power of faith was the subject of discourse; not that that power can cast the mountains on the earth into the sea, but it can cast out the evils that are from hell.<p>Moreover, the mountains in the spiritual world upon which the evil dwell are often overturned and cast down by faith from the Lord; for when the evils with such are cast down, the mountains upon which they dwell are also cast down, as has been several times said before; and this has often been seen by me. That no other faith than the faith of charity from the Lord is here meant is evident from what follows in the Lord's discourse in Mark, where it is said:<p>Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever that praying ye ask for, believe that ye are to receive, and it shall be done for you. But when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any, that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye shall not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your trespasses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_24.htm">Mark 11:24-26</a>).<p>This makes evident that "the faith of God," of which the Lord here speaks, is the faith of charity, that is, the faith that makes one with charity, and is therefore wholly from the Lord. Moreover, the Lord said these things to the disciples when they supposed that they could do miracles from their own faith, thus from themselves; nevertheless such things are done by faith from the Lord, thus by the Lord (as is also evident from <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_19.htm">Matthew 17:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_20.htm">20</a>, where like things are said).</p><p>[54] Because "mountains" signified the goods of celestial love, and "hills" the goods of spiritual love, the ancients, with whom the church was representative, had their Divine worship upon mountains and hills, and Zion was upon a mountain, and Jerusalem on mountainous places below it. But that the Jews and Israelites, who were given to idolatry, might not turn Divine worship into idolatrous worship, it was commanded them that they should have their worship in Jerusalem only, and not elsewhere; but because they were idolaters at heart they were not content to have their worship in Jerusalem, but after a custom of the nations derived from the ancients they everywhere held worship upon mountains and hills, and sacrificed and burnt incense thereon; and because this was idolatrous with them, worship from evils and falsities was signified by their worship upon other mountains and hills; as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Upon a mountain high and lifted up hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to sacrifice sacrifices (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_7.htm">Isaiah 57:7</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Backsliding Israel is gone away upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and thou hast played the harlot (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_3_6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>).<p>"To play the harlot" signifies to falsify worship; that this was idolatrous, is evident from these words in Moses:<p>Ye shall destroy the places wherein the nations served their gods, upon the mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_12_2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>).<p>In these passages, therefore, worship upon mountains and hills signifies worship from evils and falsities. From this, also, it came that the nations in Greece placed Helicon on a high mountain, and Parnassus on a hill below it, and believed that their gods and goddesses dwelt there; this was derived from the ancients in Asia, and especially those in the land of Canaan, who were not far away, with whom all worship consisted of representatives.</p><p>[55] It is said in the Gospels:<p>The devil took Jesus up into a high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and tempted Him there (<a href="../njhd/201.htm">201</a>, <a href="../njhd/293.htm">293</a>, <a href="../njhd/302.htm">302</a>.)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Hebrew has "God," which we find in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8331.htm">AC 8331</a>; in his own copy of TCR he corrected the reading n. <a href="../ae/303.htm">303</a> of "King" in the margin to "God."

Sciendum est quod omnes qui in amore sui sunt, imprimis qui in amore imperandi, in summa cupidine sint, dum in mundum spiritualem veniunt, in alta loca se efferre, hoc enim insitum est illi amori; unde etiam in sermonem communem venit dicere, "alto et elato animo esse", et "alta spirare";

"desolatio" dicitur de vero quod fidei, et "vastatio" de bono quod charitatis: jactantia et elatio animi ex falsis quae dicunt esse vera, significatur per "superbiam roboris"; "robur" et "potentia" dicitur de veris ex bono, quia illis est omne robur et omnis potentia; hic autem, quia ex jactantia et elatione animi, de falsis: quod non bonum charitatis et fidei amplius sit, significatur per "desolati <sup>12</sup></p><p>sunt montes Israelis": quod prorsus non bonum sed malum, significatur per "ut non transiens."</p><p>[38] Apud eundem,<p>"Fili hominis, pone facies tuas ad montes Israelis, et propheta contra illos, et dices, Montes Israelis, audite verbum Domini Jehovih;

"terra" est ecclesia, et "fundamenta" sunt principia super quibus fundantur reliqua: dicitur "cum populo suo, cum Israele", quia per "populum" intelliguntur qui in veris et qui in falsis sunt, et per "Israelem" qui in bonis et qui in malis.</p><p>[41] Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Ecce Ego contra te, mons perdens, ... perdens universam terram;

"terra" est ecclesia: interitus et damnatio eorum per falsa mali, significatur per "devolvam te de petris"; "petrae" sunt ubi vera fidei, hic falsa mali: ac interitus et damnatio eorum per mala falsi significatur per "dem te in montem combustionis";
