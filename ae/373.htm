<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 373</h4><p>373. And he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. That this signifies the estimation of truth from the Word in that state of the church, is clear from the signification of him that sat on the horse, as denoting the Word (see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">643</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10376.htm">10376</a>. Here, therefore, by the balance in the hand of him that sat on the black horse, is signified the estimation of truth from the Word.</p><p>[2] That he who sat upon the horses, not only upon the white horse, but upon the red, the black, and the pale horses, signifies, the Word, and by the horses, according to their colours, is signified the understanding thereof - by the red horse the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good, and by the black horse the understanding of the Word destroyed as to truth has been shown above. But because it cannot easily be comprehended that he who sat on the horses signifies the Word, in consequence of the red and the black horses signifying the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good and as to truth, therefore it shall be explained how the case is. The Word in itself is the Divine truth itself, but the understanding thereof is according to the state of the man who reads it; the man who is not in good perceives nothing of the good therein, and the man who is not in truths sees nothing of the truth therein; the reason of this, therefore, is not in the Word, but in him who reads it. Hence it is evident that he who sat on the horses still signifies the Word, although the horses themselves signify the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good and as to truth. That he who sat upon the white horse signifies the Word, plainly appears in the Apocalypse (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_13.htm">19:13</a>), where it is said:<p>"The name of him who sat upon that horse is called the Word of God."</p><p>[3] That by a balance or scales is signified estimation, and also just arrangement, which is effected by truths, is clear in Daniel:<p>The writing appeared upon the wall before Belshazzar the king of Babylon when he was drinking out of the vessels of gold and silver belonging to the temple of Jerusalem, "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," that is, numbered, numbered, weighed, divided. "This is the interpretation of these words: Mene; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. Tekel; Thou art weighed in the balance, and art found wanting. Upharsin; the kingdom is divided, and given to the Mede and Persian" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_5.htm">5:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_25.htm">25-28</a>).<p>By this matter of history, in the internal sense, is described the profanation of good and truth, which is signified by Babylon; for Belshazzar was king in Babylon, and by a king in the Word is signified the same as by the nation or kingdom itself over which he reigns. The profanation of the good and truth of the church is signified by his drinking out of the vessels of gold and silver belonging to the temple of Jerusalem, and at the same time praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone (as mentioned in verse 4). By the golden and silver vessels of the temple of Jerusalem the good and truth of heaven and the church are signified; by gold good, and by silver truth; and by praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone, is signified idolatrous worship of every kind, thus external worship without any internal, such as exists with those who are understood by Babylon. That there is no church at all with such persons, because there is nothing of the good and nothing of the truth of the church in them, is signified by the writing from heaven; for by, numbered, numbered, is signified exploration as to good and truth; and by being weighed in the balance, is signified, estimation according to their quality, and judgment; and by being divided, is signified dispersion, extermination, and separation from the good and truth of the church; and by kingdom is signified the church; hence it is evident, that by being weighed in the scale or balance, is signified estimation according to quality thereof. (That to divide signifies to disperse, to exterminate, and to separate from good and truth, may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_38.htm">13:38</a>).</p><p>[4] In Isaiah:<p>"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured the heavens with a span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a tierce, and weighed the mountains in a scale, and the hills in balances?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_12.htm">40:12</a>).<p>By the measures here are described the just arrangement and estimation of all things in heaven and in the church, according to the quality of good and truth. The measures here are, the hollow of the hand, the span, the tierce, the scale, and balances; by waters are signified truths; by the heavens, interior or spiritual truths and goods; by the dust of the earth, exterior or natural truths and goods, both of heaven and the church; by mountains, the goods of love; by hills, the goods of charity; and by weighing them, to estimate and arrange according to their quality. That these things are signified by those words, no one can see except from the knowledge of correspondences.</p><p>[5] Because the just estimation and exploration of good and truth are signified in the Word by measures, therefore it was commanded that the measures should be just, and not fraudulent, in Moses:<p>"Ye shall not deal perversely in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances, just stones, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_19_35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_19_36.htm">36</a>);<p>and therefore also justice, where there is meant thereby the estimation and exploration of men according to the quality of the good and truth with them, is everywhere in the Word expressed by scales, balances, and by ephahs, omers, homers, seas, hins (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_6_2.htm">Job 6:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_31_6.htm">31:6</a>); and injustice is expressed by scales and balances of fraud and deceit (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_12_7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 373</h4><p>373. And he that sat upon him had a balance in his hand, signifies the estimation of truth from the Word in that state of the church. This is evident from the signification of "he that sat upon the horse," as being the Word (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/643.htm">Arcana Coelestia 643[1-4]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8609.htm">8609</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10376.htm">10376</a>.) Here, therefore, "a balance in the hand of him that sat upon the black horse" signifies the estimation of truth from the Word.</p><p>[2] It has been shown above that "he that sat upon the horses"-the white, the red, the black, and the pale horse-signifies the Word, and the "horses," according to their colors, signify the understanding of the Word, "the red horse" the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good, and "the black horse" the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to truth. But as it is difficult to comprehend that "he that sat upon the horses" signifies the Word, in consequence of the red and the black horses signifying the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good, and in respect to truth, it shall be explained how it is. The Word in itself is Divine truth, but the understanding of it is according to the state of the man who reads it. A man who is not in good perceives nothing of the good in it, and a man who is not in truths sees nothing of the truth in it; the cause of this, therefore, is not in the Word, but in him who reads it. This makes clear that "he that sat upon the horses" signifies the Word, although the horses themselves signify the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good and in respect to truth. That "he that sat upon the white horse" signifies the Word is plainly evident in Revelation, where it is said:<p>The name of the one sitting upon that horse is called the Word of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>).</p><p>[3] That "a balance" or "scales" signify estimation, and also a just arrangement, which is effected by truths, is evident in Daniel:<p>A writing appeared upon the wall before Belshazzar the king of Babylon when he was drinking out of the vessels of gold and silver belonging to the temple of Jerusalem. Mene, Mene, Tekel, Perezin, that is, numbered, numbered, weighed, divided. This is the interpretation of these words: Mene, God hath numbered thy kingdom and brought it to an end. Tekel, Thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting. Peres, Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Mede and the Persian (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_25.htm">Daniel 5:25-28</a>).<p>This history describes in the internal sense the profanation of good and truth, which is signified by "Babylon," for Belshazzar was king in Babylon, and a "king" in the Word signifies the same as the nation or kingdom itself over which he reigns. The profanation of the good and truth of the church is signified by "his drinking out of the vessels of gold and silver belonging to the temple at Jerusalem, and at the same time praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_3.htm">verses 3 and 4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_4.htm">4</a>). "The gold and silver vessels belonging to the temple at Jerusalem," signify the good and truth of heaven and the church, "gold" meaning good, and "silver" truth; and "praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone," signifies idolatrous worship of every kind, thus external worship without any internal, such as is with those who are meant by Babylon. That there is no church at all with such, because there is nothing of the good and nothing of the truth of the church in them, is signified by the writing from heaven; for "numbered, numbered," signifies exploration in respect to good and in respect to truth; "weighed in the balance," signifies estimation in accordance with their quality, and judgment; "divided," signifies dispersion and expulsion from the good and truth of the church and separation therefrom; and "kingdom" signifies the church; from which it is clear that "weighed in the scale or balance," signifies estimation in accordance with their quality. (That "to divide" signifies to disperse, to expel, and to separate from good and truth, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_38.htm">13:38</a>).</p><p>[4] In Isaiah:<p>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out the heavens with a span, and embraced the dust of the earth in a measure [of three fingers]; and weighed the mountains in a balance, and the hills in scales? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>).<p>These measures describe the just arrangement and estimation of all things in heaven and in the church according to the quality of good and truth. The measures here are, "the hollow of the hand," "the span of the hand," "the measure [of three fingers]," "the balance" and "the scales:" "waters" signify truths; "the heavens" interior or spiritual truths and goods; "the dust of the earth" exterior or natural truths and goods, both of heaven and of the church; "mountains" the goods of love; "hills" the goods of charity; and "to weigh" means to estimate and arrange in accordance with their quality. That such is the signification of these words, no one can see except from a knowledge of correspondences.</p><p>[5] As a just estimation and exploration of good and truth are signified in the Word by "measures," it was commanded that the measures should be just, with no fraud about them. In Moses:<p>Ye shall not do perversity in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in dimension. Just balances, just stones, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_19_35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>).<p>So justice, where it means the estimation and exploration of men in accordance with the quality of good and truth in them, is everywhere in the Word expressed by scales and balances of various kinds, and by "ephahs," "omers," "homers," "seas," "hins" (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_6_2.htm">Job 6:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_31_6.htm">31:6</a>); and injustice is expressed by "scales and balances of fraud and deceit" (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_12_7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 373 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>373. "Et sedens super illo habens stateram in manu sua." - Quod significet aestimationem veri ex Verbo in illo statu ecclesiae, constat ex significatione "sedentis super equo", quod sit Verbum (ut supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355" target=_top>355</a> (a, c), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_356" target=_top>356</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_365" target=_top>365</a>(a)); et ex significatione "staterae in manu", quod sit aestimatio veri inde; omnes enim mensurae et ponderationes, quae memorantur in Verbo, significant aestimationem rei de qua agitur quoad bonum et quoad verum; numeri adjuncti determinant aestimationem quoad ejus quale et quantum, ut hic "choenix tritici denario et tres choenices hordei denario", de quibus sequitur. Mensurae in ecclesia repraesentativa erant plures, sicut omer, chomer, ephah, bathus, hin (de quibus videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10262" target=_top>10262</a>); et praeterea erant staterae, lances seu librae, per quas fiebant trutinationes et ponderationes, et per has in specie significantur aestimationes rei quoad verum; quare etiam pondera lancium erant lapides seu ex lapide, per "lapides" enim in Verbo significantur vera. Quod pondera fuerint lapides seu ex lapide, constat ex <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_19_36" target=_top>Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_25_13" target=_top>Deuteronomius 25:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_25_2" target=_top>2</a> Samuelis 14:26; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_34_11" target=_top>Esaias 34:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_4_10" target=_top>Sacharia 4:10</a>. <p>(Quod "lapides" in Verbo significent vera, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_643" target=_top>643</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3720" target=_top>3720</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6426" target=_top>6426</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8609" target=_top>8609</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10376" target=_top>10376</a>.) Quapropter hic per "stateram in manu sedentis super equo nigro" significatur aestimatio veri ex Verbo.<p>[2] Quod "sedens super equis", tam "super equo albo", quam "super rufo", "nigro" et "pallido", significet Verbum, et per "equos" secundum colores eorum intellectus ejus, per "equum rufum" intellectus Verbi deperditus quoad bonum, et per "equum nigrum" intellectus Verbi deperditus quoad verum, supra ostensum est: sed quia aegre capi potest quod "sedens super equis" significet Verbum, quia per "equos rufum et nigrum" significatur intellectus Verbi deperditus quoad bonum et quoad verum, quare dicetur quomodo cum hoc se habet:Verbum in se est ipsum Divinum Verum, sed intellectus ejus est secundum statum hominis qui legit. Homo qui non in bono est, nihil boni ibi appercipit; et homo qui non in veris est nihil veri ibi videt; quare causa non est in Verbo sed in legente illud. Inde patet quod usque "sedens super equis significet Verbum, tametsi "equi" significant intellectum Verbi deperditum quoad bonum et quoad verum. <p>Quod "sedens super equo albo" significet Verbum, constat manifeste in Apocalypsi, ubi dicitur,<p>Vocatur nomen sedentis super equo illo "Verbum Dei" (cap. 19:13).<p>[3] Quod per "stateram" seu "lances" significetur aestimatio, et quoque justa ordinatio, quae fit per vera, constat apud Danielem,<p>Apparuit scriptura in pariete coram Belschazare rege Babelis, cum biberat ex vasis auri et argenti Templi Hierosolymitani, "Mene Mene, Thekel, et Perezin", hoc est, Numeratus Numeratus, Appensus, Divisus. "Haec interpretatio illorum verborum est: Mene, numeravit Deus regnum tuum et finivit illud; Thekel, appensus es in trutina et deprehensus deficiens; Perez, divisum est regnum tuum, et datum Medo et Persae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_5_25-28" target=_top>5:25-28</a>):<p>describitur per hoc historicum in sensu interno profanatio boni et veri, quae significatur per "Babel"; Belschazar enim erat rex in Babele, et per "regem" in Verbo simile Significatur quod per ipsam gentem aut per ipsum regnum cui praeest: profanatio boni et veri ecclesiae significatur per quod "biberit ex vasis auri et argenti Templi Hierosolymitani, et simul laudaverit deos auri, argenti, aeris, ferri, ligni et lapidis" (vers. [3,] 4 ibi); per "vasa Templi Hierosolymitani aurea et argentea" significatur bonum et verum caeli et ecclesiae, per "aurum" bonum, et per "argentum" verum; et per "laudare deos auri, argenti, aeris, ferri, ligni et lapidis", significatur cultus idololatricus omnis generis, ita cultus externus absque ullo interno, qualis est apud illos qui intelliguntur per "Babelem": quod nulla prorsus ecclesia apud illos sit, quia nihil boni et nihil veri ecclesiae ibi est, significatur per scripturam e caelo; nam per "numeratus numeratus" significatur exploratio quoad bonum et quoad verum; per "appensus in trutina" significatur aestimatio secundum quale eorum ac judicium; et per "divisus significatur dissipatio, exterminatio, et separatio a bono et vero ecclesiae; et per "regnum" significatur ecclesia; inde patet, quod (per) "appendi in trutina" seu "statera" significetur aestimatio secundum quale ejus; (quod "dividare" significet dissipare, exterminare, et separare a bono et vero, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4424" target=_top>4424</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6360" target=_top>6360</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6361" target=_top>6361</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9093" target=_top>9093</a>); quod regnum sit ecclesia, est quia regnum Domini est ubi ecclesia; quapropter illi qui ab ecclesia sunt, vocantur<p>"Filii regni" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_8_12" target=_top>Matthaeus 8:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_373/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_38" target=_top>13:38</a>).<p>[4] Apud Esaiam,<p>"Quis mensus est pugillo suo aquas, et caelos spithama exaequavit, complexusque est in trientali pulverem terrae, et appendit in libramontes, et colles in lancibus?"
