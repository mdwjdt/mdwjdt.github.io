<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 863</h4><p>863. For they are virgins. That this signifies for the reason that they are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, is evident from the signification of virgins, as denoting the affections of truth, which are called spiritual. For there are affections of truth which are natural, and this is the case with almost all people, especially during youth and adolescence; and such natural affections have reward as an end; in the first place fame, and afterwards honour and gain. But these affections are not meant here by virgins, but spiritual affections of truth, which are those which have eternal life, and the uses of that life as their end. Those who are in these affections, love truths because they are truths, thus apart from the world's glory, honours, and gain. And those who love truths apart from such things, love the Lord; for the Lord is with man in the truths which are from good. For that which proceeds from the Lord as a Sun is Divine truth; and the Lord is that which proceeds from Himself. He, therefore, who receives truth because it is truth, from spiritual love, receives the Lord. Hence it is said of such, "These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." These are also meant by these words of the Lord, in Matthew:<p>"The kingdom of the heavens is like to a treasure hid in a field, which when a man hath found he hideth; and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth the field."<p>Again:<p>"The kingdom of the heavens is like to a merchantman seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_44.htm">13:44-46</a>).<p>By the treasure hid in the field, and by the pearls, are signified the truths of heaven and the church; and by the one precious pearl is signified the acknowledgment of the Lord. The affection of truths for their own sake is signified by the man going for joy, and selling all that he had, and buying the field in which the treasure was hid; also by the merchantman going and selling all that he had, and buying the precious pearl.</p><p>[2] Those who are in the spiritual affection of truth are called virgins, from the marriage of good and truth, from which proceeds conjugial love. For the wife is the affection of good, and the husband is the understanding of truth; females and males are such by birth. Now because virgins love to be conjoined to men who are in the understanding of truth, therefore they signify the affections of truth. But upon this subject more may be seen in the work concerning <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_4.htm">1:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_18.htm">18</a>).<p>The devastation of Divine truth in the church is described by these words. Zion, of which these words are spoken, signifies the church where the Lord reigns by means of Divine truth. The ways of Zion mourning, signifies that Divine truths are no longer sought. No one coming to the feast, signifies that there is then no worship. All her gates being laid waste, signifies that there is no approach to truths. Her priests sigh, her virgins are sad, signifies that the affections of good and the affections of truth are destroyed. He hath prostrated all my mighty men in the midst of me, signifies that all the power of truth against falsities has perished. He hath proclaimed against me the time appointed, signifies its last state, when the Lord is about to come. To break my young men, signifies, when there is no longer any understanding of truth. The Lord hath trodden the wine-press for the virgin daughter of Zion, signifies, when all the truths of the Word are falsified. My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity, signifies, when all affection of truth and the understanding of truth have perished by falsities.</p><p>[3] Again:<p>"The elders of the daughter of Zion, they sit on the earth, they keep silence; they have cast up dust upon their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth, the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. What shall I testify to thee, to what shall I liken thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? The boy and the old man have lain in the streets; my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_21.htm">21</a>).<p>By these words also is described the devastation of Divine truth in the church; the daughter of Zion denoting the church in which the Lord reigns by means of Divine truth. Grief on account of her devastation is described by sitting on the earth, by the elders being silent, by casting up dust upon the head, by girding themselves with sackcloth, and by hanging down the head to the earth. By the elders of the daughter of Zion are signified those who have been in Divine truths. By the virgins of Jerusalem are signified those who have taught truths from affection for truth. The boy and the old man have lain in the streets, signifies that, with Divine truths, innocence and wisdom are destroyed. My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword, signifies that all the affection of truth and the understanding of truth have perished by falsities, virgin denoting the affection of truth, young man the understanding of truth; and to fall by the sword, to perish by falsities.</p><p>[4] Again:<p>"Our skins are blackened as an oven on account of the storms of famine; the women in Zion were violated, the virgins in the cities of Judah; the princes were hanged up by their hands, the faces of the elders were not honoured" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_10.htm">Lamentations 5:10-12</a>).<p>Here similar things are involved. What is signified by the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah, and by the princes and old men, has been explained above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_11.htm">8:11</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_13.htm">13</a>).<p>This refers to the want of Divine truth. Such want is meant by famine and thirst. It is said, therefore, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for waters, but of hearing the words of Jehovah. That the affection of truth and the understanding of truth will cease through want, is signified by, in that day, the virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst.</p><p>[5] In Isaiah:<p>"Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; the sea hath spoken, the fortress of the sea, saying, I have not travailed nor brought forth; I have not nourished young men, nor brought up virgins" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_4.htm">23:4</a>).<p>By Zidon and Tyre is meant the church as to the knowledges of good and truth; and by the sea and the fortress of the sea, the Natural where those knowledges are. That none are reformed by those knowledges is signified by, I have not travailed nor brought forth; and that consequently there is no understanding of truth, nor affection of truth, is signified by, I have not nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.</p><p>[6] In David:<p>God "gave up his people to the sword, and was wroth with his inheritance. The fire hath devoured his young men, and his virgins are not given in marriage. Their priests have fallen by the sword" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_62.htm">Psalms 78:62-64</a>).<p>Here also the devastation of the church by falsities and evils is treated of. God gave up His people to the sword, and was wroth with His inheritance, signifies that the church perished by falsities and evils; the sword denoting the destruction of truth by falsities; and being wroth, destruction by evils. The people signify those in the church who are in truths, and the inheritance, those who are in goods; in this case, those who are in falsities and evils. The fire hath devoured His young men, signifies that the love of self and the pride of their own intelligence thence, have destroyed the understanding of truth. His virgins are not given in marriage, signifies that the affections of truth perished, through not understanding truth. His priests have fallen by the sword, signifies that the goods of the church, which are the goods of works, charity, and life, were destroyed by falsities.</p><p>[7] In Moses:<p>"Without shall the sword bereave, and from the inner chambers terror, both the young man and the virgin, the suckling with the man of age" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>).<p>Without shall the sword bereave, and from the inner chambers terror, signifies that falsity and evil, which are from hell, shall devastate both the natural and the rational man. The young man and virgin signify the understanding of truth and the affection for it. The suckling with the man of age, signifies innocence and wisdom.</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>"By thee will I disperse nations, and by thee will I destroy kingdoms; by thee will I disperse the horse and the rider; by thee will I disperse the chariot and him that is carried therein; by thee will I disperse the old man and the boy; by thee will I disperse the young man and the virgin; by thee will I disperse the shepherd and his flock; by thee will I disperse the husbandman and his yokes; by thee will I disperse the officers and the rulers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_20.htm">51:20-23</a>).<p>These things are said of Jacob and Israel, by whom, in the highest sense, is meant the Lord, who was to destroy the evils and falsities which ruled in the church about the time of His advent. By the nations and kingdoms which He will disperse, are signified evils and falsities in general. By the horse and his rider, are signified reasonings from falsities against truth. By the chariot and him who is carried therein, are signified the falsities of doctrine. By old man and boy, are signified falsities confirmed and not confirmed. By young man and virgin, are signified the understanding of falsity and the affection for it. By the shepherd and his flock are signified those who teach and those who learn. By the husbandman and his yokes, are signified things of a similar kind. By officers and rulers, are signified the principles of falsity and evil.</p><p>[9] In Ezekiel:<p>"Jehovah said, go through the midst of the city, and through the midst of Jerusalem, and slay to destruction the old man, the young man, the virgin, and the infant, and the women; but against any man upon whom is the sign, approach not" (<a href="../ae/427.htm">427</a>).</p><p>[10] In Joel:<p>"They cast lots upon my people, and gave a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, which they drank" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_3.htm">3:3</a>).<p>To cast lots upon the people, signifies to disperse the truths of the church by means of falsities. To give a boy for a harlot, signifies to falsify the truths of the Word. To sell a girl for wine, signifies to falsify the goods of the Word. Which they drank, signifies being tainted with falsity.</p><p>[11] In Zechariah:<p>"The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in my streets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_5.htm">8:5</a>).<p>By boys and girls are signified the truths and goods of innocence, such as the truths and goods of the Word are, which essentially constitute the church. By the streets of the city are signified doctrinals, which was the reason that the ancients taught in the streets. And to play in the streets, signifies to be glad and rejoice on account of them.</p><p>[12] In Jeremiah:<p>"Again will I build thee, O virgin Israel; then shall the virgin be glad in her dance, and the young men and old men together" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_4.htm">31:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_13.htm">13</a>).<p>By the virgin Israel is signified the church from the affection of truth. Then shall the virgin be glad in the dance, signifies the gladness of heart of those who are in the spiritual affection of truth; because all spiritual gladness is from the affection for truth. Wherefore to play, dance, sing, and similar things, are spoken in the Word of virgins and damsels.</p><p>[13] Because the church is a church from the spiritual affection for truth, which is the love of truth for the sake of truth, therefore mention is made in the Word throughout of<p>"The virgin Israel" (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_4.htm">31:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_2.htm">Amos 5:2</a>).<p>"The virgin daughter of Zion" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_19_21.htm">2 Kings 19:21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_13.htm">2:13</a>).<p>"The virgin daughter of my people" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>).<p>"The virgin daughter of Zidon" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>).<p>"The virgin daughter of Egypt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>).<p>Also:<p>"The virgin daughter of Babel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>).<p>In David:<p>"They have seen thy steps, O God, the steps of my God, my King, in the sanctuary; the singers went before, the players on instruments followed after, in the midst of the virgins playing on the timbrels" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_24.htm">Psalms 68:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_26.htm">26</a>).<p>These things are said of the Lord, who is there meant by my God and my King. And His Advent is meant by His steps in the sanctuary. By the singers, the players on instruments and on timbrels, are signified all those who belong to His spiritual and celestial kingdoms. By the singing virgins, those who belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. By players on instruments and on the timbrels, those who belong to His celestial kingdom; these are called virgins from the affection of truth and good. And singing, playing on instruments and on timbrels, are said of their gladness and joy of heart. For by instruments which are beaten and those which are blown is described the joy of those who belong to the celestial kingdom, but by stringed instruments and singing the gladness of those who belong to the spiritual kingdom is described.</p><p>[14] Again:<p>"The daughters of kings among the precious ones; at thy right hand standeth the queen in purest gold of Ophir; hear, O daughter, and see, incline thine ear, then shall the king be delighted in thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, therefore bow thyself down to him. Also the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift, the rich of the people shall intreat thy favour. The king's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing of wrought gold; she shall be brought unto the king in broidered garments; the virgins that follow her, her companions, shall be brought to him, with joy and exultation they shall be brought, into the palace of the king" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9-15</a>).<p>That these things are said of the Lord, is evident from the verses that precede, 2-8, and from those that follow, 16 and 17. And by the daughters of kings are signified affections for Divine truth. By the queen at His right hand in purest gold of Ophir, is signified heaven and the church, which are in Divine truths from Divine good. To hear, see, and incline the ear, which are said of the King's daughter, signify to hearken, perceive, and obey; thus to understand, to act, and be wise, from the Lord. That then she will be accepted of the Lord, is signified by, then shall the King be delighted in thy beauty, beauty being predicated of the affection of truth; for this constitutes the beauty of the angels. Therefore, bow thyself down to Him, signifies worship from a humble heart. Also the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift, signifies worship from those who are in the knowledges of truth. The rich of the people shall intreat thy favour, signifies adoration from those who are in intelligence from those knowledges. The King's daughter is all glorious within, signifies the spiritual affection of truth, which is called glorious from the abundance of truth; and within, signifies spiritual. Her clothing of wrought gold, signifies investing truths formed from the good of love. She shall be brought to the King in embroidered garments, signifies appearances of truth, such as exist in the literal sense of the Word. The virgins that follow her, her companions, signifies spiritual-natural affections of truth, which are of service. With joy and exultation they shall be brought, they shall come into the palace of the king, signifies with heavenly joy into heaven, where the Lord is.</p><p>[15] Because the daughters of a king signified spiritual affections for truth; and their garments signified truths in the ultimate of order, such as the truths of the Word in the literal sense are; therefore,<p>The daughters of a king, whilst they were virgins, were formerly clothed in robes made of variegated pieces, as is said of Tamar, the daughter of David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_13_18.htm">2 Sam. 13:18</a>).<p>In Zechariah:<p>"How great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty; corn maketh the young men to grow, and new wine the virgins" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_17.htm">9:17</a>).<p>This treats also of the Lord. And by His goodness and beauty are meant Divine good and Divine truth. Corn makes the young men to grow, and new wine the virgins, signifies that the understanding of truth, and the affection for truth, are formed by means of good and truth from Him.<p>From these passages it is clear that by virgins, in the Word, are signified affections of truth; and similarly in other passages.</p><p>[16] As in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9181.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9181-9186</a>).</p><p>[17] Because the affection for truth and the understanding of truth form a marriage, like that of a virgin espoused and married to a man, and that they afterwards make one like will and understanding, or like affection and thought, or like good and truth, in every man; and because different affections cannot be conjoined to one and the same thought, or different wills to one and the same understanding, or different truths of the church to one and the same good of love, without its resulting in the falsification and thence the dissipation of truth; hence it was that lying with a virgin who was betrothed was a crime punishable by death; according to these words in Moses:<p>"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed to a husband, and a man lie with her in the city, both shall be stoned; but if it be in the field, the man alone shall die, the damsel is not guilty of death" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-27</a>).<p>By lying together in the city is signified the adulteration of the good and truth of doctrine from the Word; for a city denotes doctrine; and stoning was a punishment for injuring the truth of doctrine. But by lying together in the field is signified the falsification of the truth of the church before it is received as a doctrinal; thus not in adulteration of the good thereof. For a field denotes the church, where truth is first implanted, and afterwards grows, and at last becomes united with doctrine; this is why the man alone had to die.<p>From these things it is also evident that virginity signifies undefiled affection for truth.<p>As in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_21_13.htm">Leviticus 21:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_8.htm">8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 863</h4><p>863. For they are virgins, signifies for the reason that they are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth. This is evident from the signification of "virgins," as being affections of truth, which are called spiritual affections of truth. For there are natural affections of truth which exist in almost everyone, especially during childhood and youth. But natural affections of truth have reward as an end, at first reputation, and afterwards honor and gain. These are not the affections here meant by "virgins," but spiritual affections of truth are meant, which are such as have for their end eternal life and the uses of that life. Those who are in such affections love truths because they are truths, thus apart from the world's glory, honors, and gains; and those who love truths apart from such considerations love the Lord; for the Lord is with man in the truths that are from good. For that which proceeds from the Lord as a Sun is the Divine truth, and that which proceeds from the Lord is the Lord; consequently he that receives truth from spiritual love because it is truth receives the Lord. Therefore of such it is said "these are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth." Moreover, such are meant by the Lord in these words in Matthew:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a treasure hidden in a field, which a man having found hideth, and in his joy goeth and selleth all things whatsoever he hath, and buyeth the field. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>).<p>"The treasure hidden in a field" and "the pearls" signify the truths of heaven and the church; and the "one precious pearl" signifies the acknowledgment of the Lord. The affection of truths because they are truths is meant by "the man went in his joy and sold all that he had, and bought the field" in which the treasure was hidden, also by "the merchant's going and selling all that he had, and buying the precious pearl."</p><p>[2] Those who are in the spiritual affection of truth are called "virgins" from the marriage of good and truth from which is conjugial love; for a "wife" is the affection of good, and a "husband" the understanding of truth; moreover, females and males are born such. Now because virgins love to be conjoined to men with whom is the understanding of truth, therefore they signify the affections of truth. (But on this see more fully in the work on <a href="../hh/366.htm">Heaven and Hell 366-386</a>, where "Marriages in the Spiritual World" are treated of.) This makes clear what "virgins" signify in the following passages in the Word.<p>In Lamentations:<p>The ways of Zion do mourn because they come not to the feast; all her gates are devastated, her priests moan, her virgins are sad, and she herself is in bitterness. The Lord hath cast down all my mighty in the midst of me; He hath proclaimed against me an appointed time for breaking my youths. The Lord hath trodden the wine-press for the virgin daughter of Zion. <sup>1</sup>Hear, I pray, all ye people, and behold my grief; my virgins and my youths have gone into captivity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_18.htm">18</a>).<p>This describes the devastation of Divine truth in the church, "Zion" of which this is said signifying the church, where the Lord reigns by the Divine truth. "The ways of Zion do mourn" signifies that Divine truths are no longer sought; "no one comes to the feast" signifies that there is at that time no worship; "all her gates are desolated" signifies that there is no approach to truths; "her priests moan, her virgins are sad," signifies that affections of good and affections of truth are destroyed; "He hath cast down all my mighty in the midst of me" signifies that all power of truth against falsities has perished; "He hath proclaimed against me an appointed time" signifies its last state, when the Lord is about to come; "for breaking my youths" signifies when there is no longer any understanding of truth; "the Lord hath trodden the wine-press for the virgin daughter of Zion" <sup>1</sup>signifies when all the truths of the Word are falsified; "my virgins and my youths have gone into captivity" signifies when all the affection of truth and the understanding of truth have perished by falsities.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the earth; they keep silence; they have cast up dust upon their head; they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem have made their head to go down to the earth. What shall I testify unto thee, to what shall I liken thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? They have lain in the streets, the boy and the old man; my virgins and my youths have fallen by the sword (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_21.htm">21</a>).<p>These words, too, describe the devastation of Divine truth in the church, "the daughter of Zion" being the church in which the Lord reigns by Divine truth; grief on account of its devastation is described by "sitting on the earth," "the elders being silent," "casting up dust upon the head," "girding themselves with sackcloth," and "making the head to go down to the earth." "The elders of the daughter of Zion" signify those who have been in Divine truths; "the virgins of Jerusalem" signify those who have taught truths from the affection of truth; "they have lain in the streets, the boy and the old man," signifies that innocence and wisdom have been destroyed, together with Divine truths; "my virgins and my youths have fallen by the sword" signifies that all the affection of truth and all the understanding of truth have perished by falsities, "virgin" being the affection of truth, "youth" the understanding of truth, and "to fall by the sword" is to perish through falsities.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>Our skins are become black like an oven because of the tempests of famine; the women in Zion have been ravished, the virgins in the cities of Judah; the princes have been hanged up by their hand; the faces of the elders have not been honored (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_5_10.htm">Lamentations 5:10-12</a>).<p>In this like things are involved. What is signified by "the women in Zion," "the virgins in the cities of Judah," and "the princes and old men," has been explained above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_13.htm">13</a>).<p>This describes the lack of Divine truth. That lack is meant by "famine" and by "thirst;" therefore it is said, "not a famine for bread nor a thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah." That the affection of truth and the understanding of truth will cease because of this lack is signified by "in that day shall the beautiful virgins and the youths faint for thirst."</p><p>[5] In Isaiah:<p>Blush, O Zidon, the sea hath said, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, neither brought forth; I have not trained up youths, I have not brought up virgins (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>).<p>"Zidon and Tyre" mean the church as to the knowledges of good and truth; and the "sea" and "the stronghold of the sea" mean the natural where such knowledges are. That none are reformed by those knowledges is signified by "I have not travailed, neither brought forth;" and that consequently there is no understanding of truth and no affection of truth is signified by "I have not trained up youths, I have not brought up virgins."</p><p>[6] In David:<p>God shut up His people to the sword, and was wroth with His inheritance. The fire hath devoured her youths, and her virgins are not wedded. Her priests have fallen by the sword (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_62.htm">Psalms 78:62-64</a>).<p>This, too, treats of the devastation of the church by falsities and evils. "God shut up His people to the sword, and was wroth with His inheritance," signifies that the church perished through falsities and evils, the "sword" signifies the destruction of truth by falsities, "to be wroth" destruction by evils, the "people" those of the church who are in truths, and "inheritance" those who are in goods, but here those who are in falsities and evils. "The fire hath devoured her youths" signifies that the love of self and thence the pride of self-intelligence have destroyed the understanding of truth; "her virgins are not wedded" signifies that the affections of truth have perished through non-understanding of truth; "her priests have fallen by the sword" signifies that the goods of the church, which are the goods of works, of charity, and of life, have been destroyed by falsities.</p><p>[7] In Moses:<p>Without shall the sword bereave, and from the chambers terror, both the youth and the virgin, the suckling with the old man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>).<p>"Without shall the sword bereave, and from the chambers terror," signifies that falsity and evil, which are from within, shall devastate both the natural and the rational man; "the youth and the virgin" signify the understanding of truth and the affection of it; "the suckling with the old man" signifies innocence and wisdom.</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>By thee I will scatter nations, and by thee I will destroy kingdoms; by thee I will scatter the horse and his rider; by thee I will scatter the chariot and him that is carried therein; by thee I will scatter the old man and the boy; by thee I will scatter the youth and the virgin; by thee I will scatter the shepherd and his flock; by thee I will scatter the husbandman and his team; by thee I will scatter the governors and the leaders (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-23</a>).<p>This is said of Jacob and Israel, by whom is meant in the highest sense the Lord, who was to destroy the evils and falsities that bore rule in the church about the time of His coming; the "nations" and "kingdoms" that He will scatter signify evils and falsities in general; "the horse and his rider" signify reasonings from falsities against truths; "the chariot and him who is carried therein" signify falsities of doctrine; "the old man and the boy" signify falsities confirmed and not confirmed; "the youth and the virgin" signify the understanding of falsity and the affection of it; "the shepherd and his flock" signify those who teach and those who learn; "the husbandman and his team" have a like signification; "governors and leaders" signify the principles of falsity and evil.</p><p>[9] In Ezekiel:<p>Jehovah said, Go through the midst of the city, and through the midst of Jerusalem. Slay to destruction the old man, the youth and the virgin, and the infant and the women; but come not against any man upon whom is the sign (<a href="../ae/427.htm">427</a>.</p><p>[10] In Joel:<p>They have cast lots upon my people, and they have given a boy for a harlot, and have sold a girl for wine which they drank (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>).<p>"To cast lots upon the people" signifies to disperse the truths of the church by falsities; "to give a boy for a harlot" signifies to falsify the truths of the Word; "to sell a girl for wine" signifies to falsify the goods of the Word; "which they drank" signifies becoming imbued with falsity.</p><p>[11] In Zechariah:<p>The streets of the city were filled with boys and girls playing in its <sup>2</sup>streets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_5.htm">Zechariah 8:5</a>).<p>"Boys and girls" signify the truths and goods of innocence, such as are the truths and goods of the Word, which essentially constitute the church; "streets of the city" signify doctrinals, for which reason the ancients taught in the streets; and "to play in the streets" signifies to be glad and rejoice from doctrinals.</p><p>[12] In Jeremiah:<p>Again will I build thee, O virgin Israel; then shall the virgin be glad in her dance, and the young men and old men together (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_13.htm">13</a>).<p>"The virgin Israel" signifies the church from the affection of truth; "then shall the virgin be glad in the dance" signifies the gladness of heart of those who are in the spiritual affection of truth, since all spiritual gladness is from the affection of truth; and this is why the expressions "to play," "to dance," "to sing," and the like, are used in the Word in reference to virgins and girls.</p><p>[13] Because the church is a church from the spiritual affection of truth, which is the love of truth for the sake of truth, the following expressions are frequently used in the Word:<p>The virgin of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_4.htm">31:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_2.htm">Amos 5:2</a>);<p>The virgin daughter of Zion (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_19_21.htm">2 Kings 19:21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_1_4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_13.htm">2:13</a>);<p>The virgin daughter of my people (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>);<p>The virgin daughter of Zidon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>);<p>The virgin daughter of Egypt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>);<p>Also the virgin daughter of Babylon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>).<p>In David:<p>They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. The singers went before, the minstrels after, in the midst of virgins playing on timbrels (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_24.htm">Psalms 68:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_25.htm">25</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord, who is here meant by "my God" and "my King," and His coming is meant by "His goings in the sanctuary," "the singers, minstrels, and players on timbrels," signify all who are of the Lord's spiritual and celestial kingdom, "the virgins singing," those who are of His spiritual kingdom, and "the minstrels and players on timbrels" those who are of His celestial kingdom; they are called "virgins" from the affection of truth and good; and "to sing, to play on instruments and on timbrels" describes the gladness and joy of their heart, for instruments played by beating and by blowing depict the joy of those who are of the celestial kingdom; while stringed instruments and singing depict the gladness of those who are of the spiritual kingdom.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>King's daughters are among thy precious ones; on thy right hand standeth the queen in the best gold of Ophir. Hear, O daughter and see, incline thine ear. Then shall the king delight in thy beauty; for he is thy lord, therefore bow thyself down to him. The daughter of Tyre also with an offering, the rich of the people shall entreat thy faces. The king's daughter is all precious within, her clothing is inwrought with gold; she shall be brought unto the king in broidered work; the virgins that follow her, her companions, shall be brought unto him; with joy and exultation they shall be brought, they shall come into the king's palace (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9-15</a>).<p>It is evident from the verses that precede (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_2.htm">Psalms 45:2-8</a>), and from those that follow (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_16.htm">Psalms 45:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_17.htm">17</a>), that this is said of the Lord. "King's daughters" signify the affections of Divine truth; "the queen that was at his right hand in the best gold of Ophir" signifies heaven and the church, which are in Divine truths from Divine good; "to hear, to see, and to incline the ear," which is said of the king's daughter, signifies to hearken, to perceive, and to obey, thus to understand, to do, and to be wise, from the Lord. That she will then be acceptable to the Lord is signified by "then shall the king delight in thy beauty," "beauty" is predicated of the affection of truth, for this is what constitutes the beauty of angels; "therefore bow thyself down to him" signifies worship from a humble heart. "And the daughter of Tyre shall send an offering" signifies worship by those who are in the knowledges of truth; "the rich of the people shall entreat thy faces" signifies adoration by those who are in intelligence from these knowledges; "the king's daughter is all glorious within" signifies the spiritual affection of truth, which is called "glorious" from abundance of truth, while "within" signifies what is spiritual; "her clothing is inwrought with gold" signifies investing truths formed from the good of love; "she shall be brought unto the king in broidered work" signifies the appearances of truth, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; "the virgins that follow her, her companions," signify the spiritual-natural affections of truth which serve; "with joy and exultation they shall be brought, they shall come into the king's palace," signifies with heavenly joy into heaven, where the Lord is.</p><p>[15] Because "king's daughters" signified the spiritual affections of truth, and their "garments" signified truths in the ultimate of order, such as the truths of the Word are in the sense of its letter, therefore:<p>The king's daughters that were virgins were formerly clothed in robes of diverse colors, as is said of Tamar the daughter of David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_13_18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>).<p>In Zechariah:<p>How great is His goodness, and how great is His beauty! Corn maketh the young men to grow, and new wine the virgins (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_17.htm">Zechariah 9:17</a>).<p>This, too, is said of the Lord; and "His goodness and beauty" mean the Divine good and the Divine truth. "Corn maketh the young men to grow, and new wine the virgins," signifies that the understanding of truth and the affection of truth are formed by good and truth from Him. It is evident from these passages that "virgins" signify in the Word the affections of truth, likewise from other passages (as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_148_12.htm">Psalms 148:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>).</p><p>[16] Because a "virgin" signified the affection of the genuine truth of the church, which is wholly in accord with the good of love, it was commanded:<p>That the high priest should not take to wife a widow, or one divorced, or one polluted, a harlot, but a virgin of his own people, lest he profane his seed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9181.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9181-9186</a>.</p><p>[17] Because the affection of truth and the understanding of truth constitute a marriage, like that of a virgin espoused and married to a man, and these afterwards make one, like will and understanding, or affection and thought, or good and truth, in every man, and because diverse affections cannot be conjoined to one and the same thought, or diverse wills to one and the same understanding, or diverse truths of the church to one and the same good of love, without causing falsifications and dispersions of truth, so lying with a virgin who was betrothed was made a crime punishable with death, according to this command in Moses:<p>If a man lie in a city with a damsel that is a virgin betrothed to a man, both shall be stoned; but if in the field the man alone shall die, to the damsel there is no crime of death (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-27</a>).<p>"Lying together in the city" signifies the adulteration of the good and truth of doctrine from the Word, for a "city" means doctrine, and "stoning" was a punishment for harm done to the truth of doctrine. But "lying together in the field" signifies the falsification of the truth of the church before it has been accepted as a doctrinal; and this is not the adulteration of its good, since a "field" means the church, in which truth at first is implanted and afterwards grows and at length becomes a matter of doctrine; and for this reason the man only should die. From this it can also be seen that "virginity" signifies the undefiled affection of truth (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_21_13.htm">Leviticus 21:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_23_8.htm">8</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "Judah," which is also found in n. <a href="../ae/922.htm">922</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "its," see above, n. <a href="../ae/652.htm">652</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 863 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>863. "Virgines enim sunt." Quod significet ex eo quod in affectione veri propter verum sint, constat ex significatione "virginum", quod sint affectiones veri, quae affectiones veri spirituales vocantur: dantur enim affectiones veri naturales, et paene apud omnes, imprimis dum pueri et adolescentes sunt; sed affectiones veri naturales pro fine habent remunerationem, primum famam, postea honores et lucra: at hae affectiones hic non intelliguntur per "virgines", sed affectiones veri spirituales, quae sunt quae pro fine habent vitam aeternam, ac usus illius vitae. Illi qui in iis affectionibus sunt, amant vera quia vera sunt, ita abstracte a gloria mundi, honoribus et lucris; et qui vera abstracte a talibus amant, illi amant Dominum; nam Dominus apud hominem est in veris quae ex bono sunt; id enim quod procedit a Domino ut sole, est Divinum Verum, ac Dominus est id quod procedit ab Ipso; quare qui recipit verum quia est verum ex amore spirituali, is recipit Dominum: inde est quod de illis dicatur, "Hi sunt qui sequuntur Agnum quocunque vadit." Illi etiam intelliguntur a Domino per haec apud Matthaeum,<p>"Simile est regnum caelorum thesauro abscondito in agro, quem repertum homo abscondit, et prae gaudio suo abit, et omnia quaecunque habet, vendit, et emit agrum. Rursus simile est regnum caelorum homini negotiatori quaerenti pulchras margaritas, qui cum invenisset unam pretiosam margaritam, abiit, vendidit omnia quae habuit, et emit eam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_863/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_44-46" target=_top>13:44-46</a>):<p>per "thesaurum absconditum in agro", et per "margaritas", significantur vera caeli et ecclesiae; et per "unam margaritam pretiosam" significatur agnitio Domini: affectio veritatum propterea quod veritates sint, intelligitur per quod "homo prae gaudio abiverit, ac omnia quae habuit vendiderit, et emerit agrum" in quo reconditus fuit thesaurus, et per quod "negotiator similiter abiens vendiderit omnia, et pretiosam margaritam emerit."<p>[2] Quod illi qui in affectione veri spirituali sunt dicantur "virgines", est ex conjugio boni et veri, ex quo est amor conjugialis; "uxor" enim est affectio boni, ac "maritus" est intellectus veri; femellae et mares etiam nascuntur tales: nunc quia virgines amant conjungi viris, apud quos est intellectus veri, ideo significant affectiones veri.
