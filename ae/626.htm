<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 626</h4><p>626. CHAPTER 11.<p>1. AND there was given to me a reed like a staff; and the angel stood near, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that adore therein.<p>2. And the court which is without the temple, cast out, and measure it not, because it is given to the nations, and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<p>3. And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.<p>4. These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands, which stand before the God of the earth.<p>5. And if any one shall desire to hurt them, fire shall go forth out of their mouth, and shall devour their enemies; and if any one shall desire to hurt them, he must thus be killed.<p>6. These have power to shut heaven, that the rain rain not in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.<p>7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast coming out of the abyss shall make war with them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.<p>8. And their bodies [are] upon the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.<p>9. And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half, and they shall not suffer their bodies to be put in sepulchres.<p>10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and be glad, and shall send gifts one to another, because those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth.<p>11. And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that saw them.<p>12. And they heard a great voice out of heaven, saying unto them, Come up hither; and they ascended into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.<p>13. And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake names of men seven thousand; and the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<p>14. The second woe is past; behold, the third woe cometh quickly.<p>15. And the seventh angel sounded, and there followed great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and his Christ's, and he shall reign unto the ages of the ages.<p>16. And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and adored God,<p>17. Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and who wast, and who art to come, because thou hast taken thy great power and entered upon the kingdom.<p>18. And the nations were angered, and thine anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy those that destroy the earth.<p>19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple; and there were lightnings and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.<p>EXPLANATION.<p>Verses 1, 2. And there was given to me a reed like a staff; and the angel stood near, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that adore therein. And the court, which is without the temple, cast out, and measure it not, because it is given to the nations, and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<p>"And there was given to me a reed like a staff," signifies the mode of visitation, that is, of exploring the quality of the church as to truth and as to good; "and the angel stood near, saying," signifies the will of the Lord and command; "Rise, measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that adore therein," signifies to explore the quality of the church, as to its reception of Divine Truth and Divine Good, and thence as to the worship of the Lord. "And the court which is without the temple, cast out, and measure it not," signifies that the external of the Word, and thence of the church and worship, is not to be explored; "because it is given to the nations," signifies because it is perverted by evils of life and falsities of doctrine; "and the holy city shall they tread under foot," signifies that they will destroy all the doctrine of truth and good from the Word; "forty and two months," signifies even to the end of the old church and the beginning of the new. </p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 626 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>626. CAPUT XI.<p>1. Et datus est mihi calamus similis baculo, et angelus adstitit dicens, Surge et metire templum Dei et altare, et adorantes in eo.<p>2. Et atrium, quod extra templum, ejice foras, et ne illud metiaris, quia datum est gentibus, et civitatem sanctam conculcabunt mensibuS quadraginta duobus.<p>3. Et dabo duobus testibus meis, et prophetabunt diebus mille ducentis sexaginta, circuminduti saccis.<p>4. Hi sunt duae olivae, et duo candelabra, quae coram Deo terrae stantia.<p>5. Et si quis illis voluerit nocere, ignis egredietur ex ore illorum, et devorabit inimicos illorum; et si quis illis voluerit nocere, ita oportet illum occidi.<p>6. Hi habent potestatem claudere caelum, ut non pluat pluvia in diebus illorum prophetiae; et potestatem habent super aquas convertere illas in sanguinem, et percutere terram omni plaga, quotiescunque voluerint.<p>7. Et cum absolverint testimonium suum, bestia ascendens ex abysso faciet bellum cum illis, et vincet illos, et occidet illos.<p>8. Et corpora illorum super platea urbis magnae, quae vocatur spiritualiter Sodoma et Aegyptus, ubi et Dominus noster crucifixus est.<p>9. Et videbunt ex populis et tribubus et linguis et gentibus corpora illorum dies tres et dimidium; et corpora illorum non permittent poni in monumenta.<p>10. Et habitantes super terra gaudebunt super illis et laetabuntur, et munera mittent invicem, quoniam illi duo prophetae cruciaverunt habitantes super terra.<p>11. Et post tres dies et dimidium spiritus vitae ex Deo intravit in illos, et steterunt super pedibus suis; et timor magnus cecidit super videntes illos.<p>12. Et audiverunt vocem magnam ex caelo dicentem illis, Ascendite huc; et ascenderunt in caelum in nube, et viderunt illos inimici illorum.<p>13. Et in illa hora factus est terrae motus magnus, et decima pars urbis cecidit, et occisa sunt in terrae motu nomina hominum millia septem; et reliqui territi facti sunt, et dederunt gloriam Deo caeli.<p>14. Vae secundum praeteriit; ecce vae tertium venit cito.<p>15. Et septimus angelus clanxit, et factae sunt voces magnae in caelo, dicentes, Facta sunt regna mundi Domini nostri et Christi Ipsius, et regnabit in saecula saeculorum.<p>16. Et viginti et quatuor seniores, qui coram Deo sedentes super thronis suis, ceciderunt super facies suas, et adoraverunt Deum;<p>17. Dicentes, Gratias agimus Tibi, Domine Deus omnipotens, qui es et qui eras et qui venturus es, quod adeptus sis potentiam tuam magnam, et regnum inieris.<p>18. Et gentes iratae sunt; et venit ira tua, et tempus mortuorum judicari, et dare mercedem servis tuis prophetis, et sanctis, et timentibus nomen tuum, parvis et magnis; et perdere perdentes terram.<p>19. Et apertum est templum Dei in caelo, et visa est arca foederis Ipsius in templo Ipsius; et facta sunt fulgura et voces et tonitrua et terrae motus et grando magna.<p>EXPLICATO.<p>VERSUS 1, 2.<p>"Et datus est mihi calamus similis baculo, et angelus adstitit dicens, Surge et metire templum Dei et altare, et adorantes in eo. Et atrium, quod extra templum, rejice foras, et ne illud metiaris, quia datum est gentibus, et civitatem sanctam conculcabunt mensibus quadraginta duobus."<p>1.

"Et atrium, quo extra templum, rejis foras, et ne illud metiaris", significat quod externum Verbi, et inde ecclesiae et cultus, non explorandum sit [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_626/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_630" target=_top>630</a>] ; "quia datum est gentibus", significat quoniam id perversum est per mala vitae et falsa doctrinae [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_626/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_631" target=_top>631</a>] ; "et civitatem sanctam conculcabunt", significat quod destructuri omnem doctrinam veri et boni ex Verbo [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_626/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_632" target=_top>632</a>] ; "mensibus quodraginta duobus", significat usque ad finem veteris ecclesiae et principium novae [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_626/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_633" target=_top>633</a>] . </p>
