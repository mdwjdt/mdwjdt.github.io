<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 383</h4><p>383. His name was Death, and Hell followed with him. That this signifies eternal damnation, appears from the signification of name, as denoting the quality of a thing (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a>, <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>); here, the quality of the Word, [with those] who are in evils and the falsities thence; from the signification of death as denoting damnation (concerning which also see above, n. <a href="../ae/186.htm">186</a>), for spiritual death is nothing else; from the signification of hell, as denoting evil and the falsity thence, because in these and from these hell exists. Furthermore, by hell is signified the same as by death, namely, damnation, but because both are here mentioned, and thus [hell] is distinguished from Death, by hell is signified eternal damnation; for those who come into hell remain there to eternity; therefore it is also said, "and Hell followed with him," to follow with him signifying to abide therein, namely, in damnation to eternity. From these considerations it is evident that by "his name was Death, and Hell followed with him," is signified eternal damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 383</h4><p>383. His name was Death, and hell followed with him, signifies eternal damnation. This is evident from the signification of "name," as being the quality of a thing (See above, n. <a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a>, <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>), here the quality of the Word with those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom; also from the signification of "death," as being damnation (of which also see above, n. <a href="../ae/186.htm">186</a>, for spiritual death is nothing else; also from the signification of "hell," as being evil and falsity therefrom, since in these and from these hell exists. Moreover, "hell" has the same signification as "death," namely, damnation; but as both are here mentioned, and thus hell is distinguished from death, "hell" signifies eternal damnation, for those who come into hell remain there to eternity; therefore it is also said, "and hell followed with him," "to follow with him" signifying to abide therein, namely, in damnation to eternity. From this it can be seen that "his name was Death, and hell followed with him" signifies eternal damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 383 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>383. "Nomen illi mors, et infernus sequebatur cum illo." - Quod significet damnationem aeternam, constat ex significatione "nominis", quod sit quale rei (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_383/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_102" target=_top>102</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_383/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_148" target=_top>148</a>), hic quale Verbi (apud illos) qui in malis et inde falsis sunt; ex significatione "mortis", quod Sit damnatio (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_383/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_186" target=_top>186</a>), mors enim spiritualis non aliud est; ex significatione "inferni", quod sit malum et inde falsum, quoniam in illis et ex illis est infernus: et praeterea per "infernum" significatur simile quod per "mortem", nempe damnatio; sed quia hic utrumque dicitur, et sic distinguitur a morte, significatur per "infernum" damnatio aeterna; nam qui in infernum veniunt, ibi manent in aeternum; quare etiam dicitur "et infernus sequebatur cum illo", nam per "sequi cum illo" significatur manere in illa, nempe in damnatione in aeternum. Ex his constare potest quod per "Nomen illi mors, et infernus sequebatur cum illo", significetur damnatio aeterna. </p>
