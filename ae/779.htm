<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 779</h4><p>779. Verse 2. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as those of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.<p>"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard," signifies reasonings which are discordant and yet appear to be coherent; "and his feet were as those of a bear," signifies from natural things, which are fallacies; "and his mouth as the mouth of a lion," signifies reasonings from falsities destroying the truths of the Word; "and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority," signifies that those who separate faith from life establish their doctrinals and confirm them by reasonings from fallacies, and are therefore strongly seductive. </p>

"Et bestia quam vidi erat similis pardo", significat ratiocinia discordantia, et usque apparentia sicut cohaereant [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_779/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_780" target=_top>780</a>] ; "et pedes ejus sicut ursi", significat ex naturalibus quae sunt fallaciae [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_779/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_781" target=_top>781</a>] ; et os ejus sicut es leonis", significat ratiocinationes ex falsis destruentibus vera Verbi [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_779/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_782" target=_top>782</a>] ; "et dedit illi draco potentiam suam, et thronum suum, et potestatem magnam", significat quod illi qui fidem a vita separant, per ratiocinationes ex fallaciis firment doctrinalia sua, et illa corroborent, et sic potenter seducant [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_779/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_783" target=_top>783</a>] . </p>
