<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 242</h4><p>242. To buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be enriched. That this signifies to procure to themselves genuine good from the Lord that they may receive the truths of faith, is evident from the signification of buying, as denoting to procure and appropriate to themselves (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4397.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4397</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5374.htm">5374</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5397.htm">5397</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5426.htm">5426</a>); and from the signification of gold tried in the fire, as denoting genuine good, thus good from the Lord, which will be explained in what follows; also from the signification of that thou mayest be enriched as denoting to be enabled to receive the truths of faith. The reason why this is signified by being rich is, that riches and wealth signify the knowledges of truth and good, and the rich those who are in intelligence therefrom; in the present case, those who are in faith, because the subject here treated of is those who hold the doctrine of faith alone. Hence it is clear that by to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich, is signified to procure to themselves genuine good from the Lord that they may receive the truths of faith.</p><p>[2] We shall first explain how this is to be understood. That truth which in itself is truth is not possible, except from good, thus that faith which is faith in itself is not possible, except from charity, has been frequently stated above; for truth, which is truth in itself, is not possible, except spiritual life be in it, and spiritual life is in it only when it is formed from the good of charity; for truth is the form of good, and good is the being (esse) of truth; thus also good is the life of truth, and good is from no other source than the Lord. And when good is from the Lord, then truth, which is from good, looks primarily to the Lord, and also to the neighbour and his good; for the Lord flows in with good, and from good forms truth, which is the truth of faith, and causes the spiritual sight of man to look to Him and to the neighbour. (That this is the case, may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/145.htm">Heaven and Hell 145</a>, <a href="../hh/251.htm">251</a>; namely, that the Lord beholds angels and men in the forehead, and they behold the Lord through the eyes; the reason is, that the forehead corresponds to the good of love, and the eye to the understanding thence enlightened, consequently to the truths of faith. And also in the same work, n. <a href="../ae/17.htm">17</a>, <a href="../ae/123.htm">123</a>, <a href="../ae/124.htm">124</a>, <a href="../ae/142.htm">142-144</a>, <a href="../ae/510.htm">510</a>, it is shown, that in the spiritual world all are turned to their own loves; and those who have acknowledged the Lord and believed in Him, are turned to Him, and hence they receive good from Him, and by good, enlightenment as to truths.) From these considerations it is plain that the genuine good signified by gold tried in the fire is from the Lord alone.</p><p>[3] Because in what is written to the angel of this church, the subject treated of is those who live according to the doctrine of faith alone; and because those who have confirmed themselves in that doctrine, and were, in the world, thence called learned, could connect falsities with truths, and induce an appearance that the doctrine was true, it was therefore granted me to converse with some of them in the other life; and because that conversation may serve for illustration, I wish to adduce it. Those learned ones, from the opinion which they held in the world, supposed that faith without charity was possible, and that man is justified by that faith alone. Their discourse was very ingenious; they said that faith was possible without charity, because it is prior to charity, and that by means of it man is in good. "Who," said they, "cannot believe that God is, that the Word is divine, and things of a similar kind, which, unless they were believed, could not be accepted and thought of by man?" They therefore concluded that faith is possible without charity, because it precedes, or is prior to it; and, such being the case, that it is saving, because a man cannot do good of himself; therefore, unless that faith saved, all men would perish. Nor was the presence of God with man possible without faith, and if it were not possible, evil would reign, and no one would possess any good; these things, they said, were meant by justification by faith alone.<p>But it was shown them that there could be no faith unless it existed with charity; and that what they called faith was only the knowledges first acquired by every man, as that God is, and that the Word is divine, and so on; and that those knowledges are not in man, but in the medium of access to him, which is his memory, until they are in his will; but that, in proportion as they are in his will, in the same proportion they are in the man himself; for the will is the man himself; and in proportion as they are in the will, in the same proportion they are in his sight, which is faith. The knowledges themselves, which precede, and, to the natural sight, appear to be believed, do not previously become knowledges of faith. This is why the seeing of knowledges, which is supposed to be faith, recedes from man successively as he begins to think evil from willing evil, and also recedes from him after death, when he becomes a spirit, if the knowledges have not been implanted in his life, that is, in his will or love.</p><p>[4] This may be illustrated by a comparison with those stomachs of birds and terrestrial animals, which are called ruminant stomachs; into these they first collect their food, and afterwards by degrees take it out thence and eat it, and so nourish the blood, whence it becomes incorporated into their life. To those stomachs man's memory corresponds, which he enjoys in the place of them, because he is spiritual. Into this he first collects spiritual foods, which consist of knowledges, and afterwards takes them out, as it were, by ruminating, that is, by thinking and willing, and appropriates them to himself, and thus makes them part of his life. From this comparison, trifling as it may appear, it is obvious that, unless knowledges are implanted in the life, by thinking and willing them, and thence by doing them, they are like foods which remain unmasticated in the ruminant stomachs, where they either become putrid, or are vomited out. Moreover, the circle of man's life is to know, to understand, to will, and to do; for the spiritual life of man commences from knowing, thence it is continued into understanding, afterwards into willing, and lastly into doing. From this it is also evident, that knowledges in the memory are only in the entrance to the life, and that they are not fully in the man until they are in his deeds; also, that they are more fully in his deeds the more fully they are in his understanding and will.</p><p>[5] It was further shown that the faith of knowledges before it becomes the faith of life, is merely historical faith, the quality of which is well known to be this, that a thing is believed because another has said it; this, before it becomes the man's, is an alien faith, or the faith of another with him. Another quality of such faith is that it is a belief in things unknown; for it is said that such things are to be believed, although they are not understood, indeed that they are not to be looked into by the understanding, although such is the nature of spiritual faith that truths themselves are seen in it, and so are believed. In heaven, no one believes any truth unless he sees or has seen it; for there they say, "Who can believe that a thing is so unless he sees it? Perhaps it may be false"; and none but the evil can believe what is false, for the evil, from evil, see falsities, whereas the good, from good, see truths; and because good is from the Lord, the seeing of truth from good is also from the Lord. The reason why the angels see truths is because the light of heaven, in which they are, is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; hence all in the world also, who have that light, enjoy the sight of truth (concerning the light of heaven, and that such is its nature and quality, see in the work, <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>).</p><p>[6] It was afterwards shown that charity and faith act as one, and enter together into man, so that in proportion as man is in charity in the same proportion he is in faith, because faith as to its essence is charity, just as truth as to its essence is good; for good, when it exists in visible manifestation, or in form, is truth; thus charity is faith, for good belongs to charity, and truth to faith. The one also loves the other, and conjoins itself to it, therefore one is not possible unless together with the other. This was illustrated by the thought of man, which belongs to his understanding, and by the affection, which belongs to his will. To think without affection is impossible, for the very essence of thought is affection or love. A man may indeed think all those things that he knows from the doctrine of the church, but from a natural affection, which is the affection or love of glory, fame, honour or gain; but this affection does not cause the thought to be spiritual, this being effected only by charity, which is spiritual affection itself. This affection, when it conjoins itself with knowledges, becomes faith, and afterwards, in proportion as man is in that affection, in the same proportion he sees in thought the things which belong to his faith, which are called truths, and acknowledges them because they are from his spirit itself, thus from his spiritual life itself: this also is what is called enlightenment. This is why no one can be enlightened from the Word unless he has the spiritual affection of truth. There is indeed something like enlightenment given to those who have confirmed themselves in such things as pertain to the doctrine of faith alone, and justification thereby; but it is a fatuous enlightenment, because they can confirm falsities equally with truths, as is the case with all heresies, both with those which prevail amongst the Jews and with those with the Papists. A similar light is also given, after such confirmations, to those who are called naturalists, who deny God, the divinity of the Word, and everything belonging to the church. The case is the same with those who have confirmed themselves in faith alone, and justification thereby. (That the light of confirmation is natural and not spiritual light, which is possible also with the evil, may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8780.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8780</a>.)</p><p>[7] But let us return to the faith which, as to essence, is charity. That faith is continually perfected by those things that confirm for from spiritual light more truths are always seen, and these all conjoin themselves with the good of charity, and perfect it; hence a man has intelligence and wisdom, which at length becomes angelic. Moreover, those who are only in the knowledges of faith, and not in a life according to them, believe that a man can easily receive faith, if not in this world, yet in the other, saying to themselves, "When I hear and see that a thing is so, cannot I then believe it?" But they are greatly deceived; for those who have not received spiritual faith in the world, if they should afterwards hear of it, and see it a thousand times, can never receive it. The reason is, that this faith is not in the man, but out of him. That this is the case, is clearly evident from this, that all those who come from the world are first received by angels and good spirits, and are instructed by every means; indeed, many things are shown them even to the life and to the sight, but still they do not receive them; therefore they withdraw themselves from the angels and good spirits, and go to those who are destitute of faith. It was, moreover, told them that, if faith could be received by knowing and thinking only, it would be received by all, by the evil and the good alike, and thus no one would be condemned. (That charity, which is spiritual affection, can never be imparted to any one unless he knows truths, explores himself according to them, receives them, and lives a new life agreeably to them, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/239.htm">239</a>.)</p><p>[8] It therefore follows that the life of faith is charity, and that there is nothing of life in faith, except in proportion as charity is therein; and also that in proportion as charity is in faith, in the same proportion man is led by the Lord; but that in proportion as charity is not in faith, in the same proportion man is led of himself; and he who is led of himself, and not by the Lord, cannot think what is good, still less can he will and do good which is good in itself. For from man's proprium nothing but evil proceeds; for when he thinks what is good, and wills and does good from proprium, it is only for the sake of himself and for the sake of the world, which are the ends for which he acts, and the ends are the loves which lead him; and man cannot be withdrawn or raised up from his proprium, unless he looks to the Lord as to the things of his life; by this he is conjoined with heaven, and spiritual affection is thence imparted to him by the Lord.<p>When these observations had been made, it was given to those with whom I discoursed on this subject to be in spiritual light, this light being such that truths can be seen in it as clearly as objects in the world are seen in its light; and then those who were in the doctrine of faith alone and justification thereby, could not but declare that the case was so. But as soon as that light was taken away from them and they were brought back into their own natural light, they could see only that the sight of knowledges is saving faith, and hence that the falsities which they had made of their faith were truths. Falsities become matters of the faith when evils are of the life.</p><p>[9] But to return to the explanation of the words of this passage, which are, I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be enriched." By these words is signified that they should procure to themselves from the Lord genuine good, in order that they may receive truths; it now remains to be shown that gold in the Word signifies the good of love. This is evident from the following passages. In Malachi:<p>"Behold, I send my angel, who shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple, and the angel of the covenant whom ye desire; he shall sit refining and purifying silver, and shall purify the sons of Levi; he shall refine them as gold and silver, that they may bring to Jehovah a meat-offering in justice" (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>: that covenant signifies conjunction, may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/665.htm">Arcana Coelestia 665</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/666.htm">666</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6804.htm">6804</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8767.htm">8767</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8778.htm">8778</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9396.htm">9396</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10632.htm">10632</a>; that silver signifies truth from good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5658.htm">5658</a>; that a meat-offering signifies the good of love and charity, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9992.htm">9992</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9993.htm">9993</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9994.htm">9994</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10079.htm">10079</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10137.htm">10137</a>; that justice is said of good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">2235</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">9857</a>.) Hence to bring an offering in justice signifies worship from the good of love.</p><p>[10] In Zechariah:<p>"Two parts in all the land shall be cut off, they shall expire, but the third shall be left in it; nevertheless I will bring the third through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined, and I will try them as gold is tried" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_8.htm">13:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Here, by all the land is not meant all the land, but the whole church; nor by the third part is a third part meant, but some who are therein. By its being brought through the fire, and refined as silver is refined, and tried as gold is tried, is signified their being purified from evils and falsities in order that good and truth may be implanted. (That land in the Word signifies the church, may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_22.htm">Numbers 31:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_23.htm">23</a>).</p><p>[11] That gold signifies the good of love and charity is more fully evident from the following passages. In Hosea:<p>"Israel hath forsaken good: the enemy pursueth him: of their silver and their gold they have made to themselves idols" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_8_3.htm">8:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_8_4.htm">4</a>).<p>By making to themselves idols of their silver and their gold is signified that they turned truth and good into falsities and evils, as is evident from its being said, "Israel hath forsaken good: the enemy pursueth him." The enemy denotes falsity from evil and evil from falsity.</p><p>[12] In Joel:<p>"What have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon? My silver and my gold have ye taken, and the desirable things of my goods have ye brought into your temples, and the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem ye have sold to the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their borders" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1729.htm">1729</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7499.htm">7499</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8897.htm">8897</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9807.htm">9807</a>; by Judah, the celestial church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6364.htm">6364</a>; by Jerusalem, the church where there is genuine doctrine, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9166.htm">9166</a>. That by the Grecians are meant falsities, because the Grecians signify the nations that are in falsities, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/50.htm">50</a>.)</p><p>[13] In Ezekiel:<p>"The traders of Sheba and Raamah, by the chief of all spices, and by every precious stone and gold they have carried on their tradings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1171.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1171</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3240.htm">3240</a>. By spices are signified truths that are grateful because derived from good, see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4748.htm">4748</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5621.htm">5621</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9474.htm">9474</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9475.htm">9475</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10199.htm">10199</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10254.htm">10254</a>. By precious stones are signified truths that are beautiful because from good, see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9863.htm">9863</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9873.htm">9873</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>. And by the garden of Eden is signified intelligence and wisdom therefrom, see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/100.htm">100</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/108.htm">108</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1588.htm">1588</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3220.htm">3220</a>. Because, now, by those things are signified the knowledges of truth and of good, and because by gold and silver are signified the goods and truths themselves, and because all intelligence and wisdom are procured by means of these, therefore it is said, "In thy wisdom and thy intelligence thou hast made to thyself wealth, gold and silver in thy treasuries."</p><p>[14] In Lamentations:<p>"How is the gold become dim! how is the best fine gold changed! the stones of holiness are poured out at the head of every street. The sons of Zion are estimated equal to pure gold; how are they reputed as bottles of earthenware, the work of the hands of the potter!" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_1.htm">4:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_2.htm">2</a>).<p>The vastation of the church is here treated of. The gold which is become dim, and the best fine gold which is changed, signify the goods of the church; the stones of holiness which are poured out at the top of every street, signify that the truths thence derived are falsified; the sons of Zion who were estimated equal to fine gold, signify the truths of the former church; bottles of earthenware, the work of the hands of the potter, signify evils of life derived from falsities of doctrine, which are from man's own intelligence.</p><p>[15] In Ezekiel:<p>"I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a necklace on thy neck. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work. Thou hast also taken the vessels of thine adorning from my gold and from my silver which I gave to thee, and hast made thee images with which thou hast committed whoredom" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10536.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10536</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10540.htm">10540</a>). Bracelets upon the hands signify specifically truths from good (see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3103.htm">3103</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3105.htm">3105</a>); a necklace upon the neck signifies the conjunction of interior goods and truths with exterior goods and truths, or of those which are spiritual with those which are natural (see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5320.htm">5320</a>); fine linen signifies genuine truth, and silk the same resplendent from interior goods (see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9469.htm">9469</a>); broidered work signifies the Scientific (Scientificum) of the natural man (see n. 9688); the images with which she committed whoredom are the fallacies of the senses, which to those who are in falsities appear like truths; to commit whoredom with them is to draw false conclusions by means of them. (That to commit whoredom signifies to imbue with falsities, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>.) From these considerations it is clear that the subject treated of in this chapter is the church, as to its quality when it was first established by the Lord, and what its quality became afterwards.</p><p>[16] In Isaiah:<p>"Behold, I stir up against them the Medes, who shall not regard silver, and shall not delight in gold, whose bows shall strike the young men, their eye shall not spare the sons" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2686.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2686</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2709.htm">2709</a>): the young men whom they shall strike signify those who are intelligent from truths (see n. 7668); the sons whom they shall not spare signify truths themselves.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>"The troop of camels shall cover thee; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of Jehovah. The isles shall trust in me, and the ships of Tarshish, to bring thy sons from afar, their silver and their gold with them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_6.htm">60:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">9</a>).<p>The subject here treated of is the Lord's Advent, and by a troop of camels are meant all those who are in the knowledges of truth and good (see Arcana Coelestia, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p>They offered those things because they signified goods and truths interior and exterior, which are gifts pleasing to God.</p><p>[18] In David:<p>"All kings shall bow down before him; all nations shall serve him. He shall preserve the souls of the poor, and they shall live; and he shall give them of the gold of Sheba" (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>; and that nations signify those who are in good, may be seen also above, n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>); by the poor whom he shall preserve are meant those who are not in the knowledges of good and truth, but yet desire them (as may be seen also above, n. <a href="../ae/238.htm">238</a>). By the gold of Sheba, of which He shall give them, is signified the good of love into which the Lord shall lead them by means of knowledges; (what is signified by Sheba may be seen just above).</p><p>[19] In Haggai:<p>"And I will rouse up all nations, that they may come, the choice of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory.

The same was signified by the<p>gold, silver and raiment which the Israelites borrowed of the Egyptians, when they departed from them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_3_22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_11_2.htm">11:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_11_3.htm">3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_12_35.htm">12:35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_12_36.htm">36</a>).<p>The reason why such a thing took place, and what it involves, may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_29.htm">29</a>; and in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_24.htm">Luke 19:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_26.htm">26</a>; and that they should make to themselves friends of the unrighteous mammon, according to the Lord's words in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>.

By the king's daughter is meant the church which is in the affection of truth, and which is described by kings' daughters being among her precious ones: by whom are meant the affections of truths themselves. By the queen standing at his right hand in the best gold of Ophir is meant the Lord's celestial kingdom, which is in the good of love; by her clothing being embroidered with gold is meant that truths are from good.</p><p>[22] In Matthew:<p>Jesus said to the disciples whom He sent forth to preach the gospel, that they should not provide gold, or silver, or brass in their purses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_9.htm">10:9</a>);<p>by which was represented that they should have nothing of good and truth from themselves, but from the Lord alone, and that all things would be given them freely. Because gold signified the good of love,<p>Therefore the table upon which was placed the showbread was overlaid with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_24.htm">24</a>).<p>Also the altar of incense, which was thence called the golden altar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_3.htm">Exodus 30:3</a>).<p>And on the same account the candlestick was made of pure gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_31.htm">Exodus 25:31-38</a>).<p>As were also the cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a>);<p>And for the same reason the ark was covered within and without with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>).<p>The same was the case with many other things in the temple of Jerusalem; for the tent in which were the ark, the cherubim, the table upon which was the showbread, the altar of incense, and the candlestick represented heaven, and so did the temple; and hence the gold therein signified the good of love, and the silver truth from good.</p><p>[23] Because the most holy thing of heaven was represented by the gold in the temple,<p>Therefore, when Belshazzar drank wine out of the vessels of gold brought out of that temple, and at the same time praised the gods of gold, of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and stone, there appeared written on the wall, Numbered, weighed, divided; and in that night he was slain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_2.htm">Dan. 5:2</a>, and following, verses);<p>for by this the profanation of good was signified.</p><p>[24] Moreover by gold, in an opposite sense, in the Word is signified the evil of the love of self, and by silver the falsity therefrom, as in Moses:<p>The silver and gold of the nations they shall not covet, because they are abominations, nor shall they bring them into their houses, but they shall be accursed, because they were to be abominated and detested (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_7_25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_7_26.htm">26</a>).<p>But concerning this signification of gold and silver we shall speak hereafter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 242</h4><p>242. To buy of Me gold tried by fire, that thou mayest be enriched, signifies that they should acquire for themselves from the Lord genuine good, that they may be able to receive the truths of faith. This is evident from the signification of "buying," as being to acquire and appropriate to oneself (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4397.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4397</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5374.htm">5374</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5397.htm">5397</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5426.htm">5426</a>); also from the signification of "gold tried by fire," as being genuine good, thus good from the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of "that thou mayest be enriched," as being to be enabled to receive the truths of faith. This is the signification of being "enriched," because "riches" and "wealth" signify the knowledges of truth and good, and "the rich" are those who are in intelligence by means of knowledges, here, those who are in faith by means of them, since those who are in the doctrine of faith alone are here treated of. From this it is clear that "to buy of Me gold tried by fire, that thou mayest be enriched," signifies that they must acquire for themselves genuine good from the Lord so that they may receive the truths of faith.</p><p>[2] It shall first be told how this is to be understood. It has often been said before, that there is no truth which is truth in itself unless it be from good, thus no faith that is faith in itself unless it be from charity: for there is no truth that is truth in itself unless there is spiritual life within it, and spiritual life is within it when it is formed out of the good of charity; for truth is the form of good, and good is the esse of truth, thus also its life; and good is from no other source than from the Lord. When there is good from the Lord, the truth that is from the good looks primarily to the Lord and also to the neighbor and his good, for the Lord flows in with good and by it forms truth, which is the truth of faith, and causes man's spiritual sight to look to him and to the neighbor. (That this is so, may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/145.htm">Heaven and Hell 145</a>, <a href="../hh/251.htm">251</a>, namely, that the Lord looks at angels and men in the forehead, and these look to the Lord through the eyes; for the reason that the forehead corresponds to the good of love, and the eyes to the understanding illustrated thereby, consequently to the truths of faith. Also in the same work, n. <a href="../hh/17.htm">Heaven and Hell 17</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>, <a href="../hh/124.htm">124</a>, <a href="../hh/142.htm">142-144</a>, <a href="../hh/510.htm">510</a>, it is shown that in the spiritual world all are turned to their own loves, and those who have acknowledged the Lord and believed in Him are turned to Him, and thereby have good, and through good, illustration in respect to truths.) From this it can be seen what the genuine good is that is signified by "gold tried by fire," namely, that it is good from the Lord alone.</p><p>[3] As what is written to the angel of this church treats of those who live according to the doctrine of faith alone, and as those who had confirmed themselves in that doctrine, and were on that account called learned in the world, were able to join falsities with truths and make the doctrine appear as if it were true, therefore, it was granted me to talk with some of them in the other life; and as the things that were then said on either side may serve for illustration I will present them. These learned ones, from their belief while in the world, supposed that there might be faith without charity, and that man may be justified by that alone. Their talk was very ingenious; they said that there is faith without charity, because it is prior to charity, and because by it man is in good. "Who," they said, "is not able to believe that there is a God, that the Word is Divine, and other like truths, which unless believed could not be received and thought of by man?"<p>From this they concluded that as faith precedes, or is prior to, charity, there can be faith without charity; and if there can be, that it must be saving, since man cannot do good from himself; unless, therefore, that faith were saving all would perish: moreover, without faith there could be no presence of God with man; and without the presence of God evil would reign, and no one would have any good. This, they said, is what is meant by justification by faith alone. But it was shown them that there could not be faith unless there was at the same time charity; and that what they called faith was nothing but the knowledges that are first with every man; for example, that there is a God, that the Word is Divine, and the like, and that these knowledges are not in the man before they are in his will, but are in the entrance to him, which is his memory; but so far as they are in his will so far they are in the man himself, for the will is the man himself; and so far as they are in the will so far they are in his sight, which is faith. The knowledges themselves that precede, and that appear to the natural sight as if believed, do not until then come to be of faith; consequently this seeing the knowledges, that is thought to be of faith, recedes step by step from man as he begins from willing evil to think evil, and also recedes from him after death when man becomes a spirit, if the knowledges have not been rooted in his life, that is, in his will or love.</p><p>[4] This may be illustrated by a comparison with the stomachs of birds and beasts of the earth that are called ruminating stomachs. Into these they first collect their food, and afterwards by degrees take it out and eat it, and thus nourish the blood; food thus becomes a part of their life. With man the memory corresponds to these stomachs; and man is endowed with memory instead of these because he is spiritual; into this he first gathers spiritual foods, which are knowledges, and afterwards he takes them out by a sort of ruminating, that is, by thinking and willing, and appropriates them, and thus makes them a part of his life.<p>From this comparison, although trifling, it can be seen that knowledges, unless implanted in the life by thinking and willing them and then doing them, are like food that remains unconsumed in ruminating stomachs, where it either becomes putrid or is vomited out. Moreover, the circle of man's life is to know, <sup>1</sup>to understand, to will, and to do; for man's spiritual life begins with knowing, passes next to understanding, then to willing, and finally to doing. From this it is clear that so long as knowledges are in the memory they are merely in the entrance to the life, and that they are not fully in man until they are in acts, and the more fully they are in acts the more fully they are in the understanding and will.</p><p>[5] It was further shown that the faith of knowledges before it becomes the faith of life is historical faith, the nature of which is well known, namely, that it is believed because another has said it; until this has been made man's own it is an alien thing, or something with ourself belonging to someone else. Historical faith, moreover, is like a belief in things unknown, for it is said that things must be believed though not understood, yea, that they must not be searched into by the understanding; and yet spiritual faith is such that in it truths themselves are seen and are consequently believed. In heaven no one believes any truth unless he sees it or has seen it; for they say, "Who can believe that a thing is so unless he sees it? It may possibly be false." And only the evil can believe what is false; for the evil from evil see falsities, but the good from good see truths; and as good is from the Lord, so also seeing truth from good is from the Lord. Angels see truths because the light of heaven, in which they are, is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; all, therefore, even those in the world, who are in that light are able to see truth. (Of the light of heaven, and that it is such, see in the work on <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>.)</p><p>[6] It was then shown that charity and faith act as one and enter together into man, thus that man is so far in faith as he is in charity, since faith as to its essence is charity, just as truth as to its essence is good; for good, when it exists in shape or in form is truth; in like manner charity is faith, for good is of charity and truth is of faith; moreover, the one loves the other and conjoins itself to the other, therefore one is not given unless the other be with it. This was illustrated by man's thought, which is of his understanding, and his affection, which is of his will; to think apart from affection is impossible, for the very essence of thought is affection or love. Man is able, to be sure, to think all things that he knows from the doctrine of the church, but only from a natural affection, which is the affection or love of glory, fame, honor or gain; but such an affection does not make thought to be spiritual; this requires charity, which is spiritual affection itself. When this is conjoined with knowledges there is faith, and then so far as man is in that affection he sees in thought the things that are of his faith, which are called truths, and acknowledges them, because they are from his very spirit, thus from his very spiritual life. This also is what is called illustration; and this is why no one can be illustrated from the Word unless he is in the spiritual affection of truth. Something like illustration there is, indeed, with those who have confirmed themselves in such things as are of the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith; but that illustration is a fatuous illustration, since falsities as well as truths can be confirmed, like all those heresies that prevail both among the Jews and among Papists. With those who are called naturalists, and who deny God, the Divinity of the Word, and all other things belonging to the church, there is a similar light after confirmations; like that with those who have confirmed themselves in faith alone and justification by faith. (That the light of confirmation is natural, not spiritual, and exists also with the evil, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8780.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8780</a>.)</p><p>[7] But let us return to the faith that in its essence is charity. That faith is continually perfected by such things as confirm; for from spiritual light more truths are constantly being seen, and all these join themselves to the good of charity, and perfect it. From this man has intelligence and wisdom, which at length become angelic. Moreover, those who are merely in the knowledges of faith, and not in a life according to them, believe that man can easily receive faith, if not in the world yet in another life, saying within themselves, "When I hear and see that a thing is so can I not believe it?" But they are greatly mistaken; for those who have not received spiritual faith in the world can never afterwards receive it, even if they were to hear of it and see it a thousand times; and for the reason that such a faith is not in man, but outside of him. That this is so can be clearly seen from this, that all who come from the world are first received by angels and good spirits, and instructed in every way, yea, many things are shown them to the life and before their very eyes, and yet they do not receive; thus they alienate themselves from angels and good spirits, and join those who are in no faith.</p><p>[8] Again, it was also told them, that if faith could be received by merely knowing and thinking it would be received by all, <sup>2</sup>the evil and the good alike, and thus no one would be damned. That charity, which is spiritual affection, can never be given to anyone unless he knows truths, examines himself by means of them, accepts them, and leads a new life in accordance with them, may be seen above n. <a href="../ae/239.htm">239</a>. From this it follows that charity is the life of faith, and that there is nothing of life in faith except in the measure of the charity that is in it; and also that in the measure that charity is in faith man is led by the Lord, but in the measure that charity is not in faith man is led by himself; and he who is led by himself and not by the Lord is unable to think of good, still less to will and do good which is good in itself; for from what is man's own [ex proprio] nothing proceeds except evil; for when a man thinks of good, and wills and does good and <sup>3</sup>what is his own [ex propio], it is only for his own sake and for the sake of the world, which are the ends of what he does, and the ends are the loves that lead him; and man cannot be withdrawn from his selfhood [a suo proprio] or elevated unless he looks to the Lord in regard to the things that are of life; by this looking he is conjoined with heaven, and from heaven a spiritual affection is given him by the Lord. When this had been said, it was granted to those with whom I was talking on this subject to be in spiritual light, which light is such that in it truths can be seen as clearly as objects in the world are seen in its light; and then those who were in the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith could not but affirm that this was true; but as soon as that light was taken away from them, and they were let back into their own light, which was natural, they were unable to see otherwise than that the sight of knowledges is saving faith, and therefore that the falsities that they had made part of their faith were truths. Falsities come to be of the faith when evils are of the life.</p><p>[9] But to return to the explanation of the words of this passage, "I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried by fire, that thou mayest be enriched," which signifies that they should acquire for themselves from the Lord genuine good, that they may be able to receive truths. It now remains to be shown that "gold" in the Word signifies the good of love. This can be seen from the following passages. In Malachi:<p>Behold, I send My angel [messenger] who shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel [messenger] of the covenant whom ye desire; He shall sit refining and purifying silver, and shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall purge them as gold and silver, that they may bring to Jehovah an offering in righteousness (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>; that "covenant" signifies conjunction, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/665.htm">Arcana Coelestia 665</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/666.htm">666</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6804.htm">6804</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8767.htm">8767</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8778.htm">8778</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9396.htm">9396</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10632.htm">10632</a>; that "silver" signifies truth from good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5658.htm">5658</a>; that "an offering" signifies the good of love and charity, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9992.htm">9992-9994</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10079.htm">10079</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10137.htm">10137</a>; that "righteousness" is predicated of good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2235.htm">2235</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9857.htm">9857</a>.) Therefore "to bring an offering in righteousness" signifies worship from the good of love.</p><p>[10] In Zechariah:<p>Two parts in all the land shall be cut off, shall expire, but the third shall be left therein. Yet I will lead the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and I will try them as gold is tried. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_8.htm">Zechariah 13:8-9</a>)<p>"All the land" does not mean all the land, but the whole church; nor does "the third part" mean a third part, but some in the church. "To lead it through the fire, and refine as silver is refined, and to try as gold is tried," signifies to so purify them from falsities and evils that good and truth may be implanted. (That "earth" [land] in the Word signifies the church, see Arcana Coelestia <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_22.htm">Numbers 31:22-23</a>).</p><p>[11] That "gold" signifies the good of love and of charity is shown further in the following passages.<p>In Hosea:<p>Israel hath forsaken good; the enemy pursueth him; they have made their silver and their gold into idols for themselves (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_8_3.htm">Hosea 8:3-4</a>).<p>"Making their silver and their gold into idols for themselves" signifies that they have turned truth and good into falsities and evils, as is evident from its being said, "Israel hath forsaken good, and the enemy pursueth him;" "the enemy" is falsity from evil, and evil from falsity.</p><p>[12] In Joel:<p>What are ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon? My silver and My gold ye have taken, and the desirable things of My goods have ye brought into your temples, and the sons of Judah, and the sons of Jerusalem ye have sold to the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their borders (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1201.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1201</a>; that "sons of Judah and sons of Jerusalem" mean all truths of good, because "sons" signify truths, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1729.htm">1729</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7499.htm">7499</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8897.htm">8897</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9807.htm">9807</a>; "Judah" the celestial church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6364.htm">6364</a>; "Jerusalem" the church where there is genuine doctrine, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9166.htm">9166</a>; that "sons of the Grecians" mean falsities, because "Grecians" signify the nations that are in falsities, see above, n. <a href="../ae/50.htm">50</a>.)</p><p>[13] In Ezekiel:<p>The traders of Sheba and Raamah, by the chief of all spices, and by every precious stone and gold, they gave for thy tradings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1171.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1171</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3240.htm">3240</a>; "spices" signify truths which are pleasing because from good, see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4748.htm">4748</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5621.htm">5621</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9474.htm">9474</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9475.htm">9475</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10199.htm">10199</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10254.htm">10254</a>; "precious stones" signify truths, which are beautiful because from good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9863.htm">9863</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9873.htm">9873</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>; "the garden of Eden" signifies intelligence and wisdom therefrom, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/100.htm">100</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/108.htm">108</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1588.htm">1588</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3220.htm">3220</a>.)

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_4_1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-2</a>).<p>Here the vastation of the church is treated of; "the gold that is become dim, and the most pure gold that is changed," signify the goods of the church; "the stones of holiness that are poured out at the head of every street," signify the truths therefrom that are falsified; "the sons of Zion, who were esteemed equal to pure gold," signify the truths of the former church; "earthen bottles, the work of the hands of the potter," signify evils of life from falsities of doctrine, which are from self-intelligence.</p><p>[15] In Ezekiel:<p>I decked thee with ornaments, and I gave bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy garments of fine linen and silk and broidered work. Thou didst also take the vessels of thine adorning of My gold and My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images with which thou couldst commit whoredom (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10536.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10536</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10540.htm">10540</a>); "bracelets upon the hands" signify in particular, truths from good (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3103.htm">3103</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3105.htm">3105</a>); "the chain upon the neck" signifies the conjunction of interior truths and goods with exterior, or things spiritual with things natural (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5320.htm">5320</a>); "fine linen" signifies genuine truth, and "silk" the same, resplendent from interior good (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9469.htm">9469</a>); "broidered work" signifies knowledge [scientificum] pertaining to the natural man (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9688.htm">9688</a>); "the images with which she committed whoredom" are the fallacies of the senses, that appear as truths to those who are in falsities; "to commit whoredom with them" is to establish falsities by fallacies (that "to commit whoredom" signifies to imbue with falsities, see above, n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>. From this it is clear that the contents of this chapter describe the church as it was when first established by the Lord, and as it afterwards became.</p><p>[16] In Isaiah:<p>Behold, I stir up against them the Medes, who shall not value silver, and shall not delight in gold; their bows shall dash to pieces the young men, their eye shall not spare the sons (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2686.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2686</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2686.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2686[1-8]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2709.htm">2709</a>); "the young men whom they shall dash to pieces" signify those who are intelligent from truths (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7668.htm">7668</a>); "the sons whom they shall not spare" signify the truths themselves.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>The troop of camels shall cover thee; they all shall come from Sheba; they shall bring gold and frankincense; and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah. The isles hope in Me, and the ships of Tarshish, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Here the coming of the Lord is treated of, and "the troop of camels" means all who are in the knowledges of truth and good (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p>They offered these because these signified goods and truths, interior and exterior, which are gifts pleasing to God.</p><p>[18] In David:<p>All kings shall bow themselves before Him; and all nations shall serve Him. He shall save the souls of the needy. And they shall live, and He shall give them of the gold of Sheba (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>; and that "nations" signify those who are in good, see also above, n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>; "the needy whom He shall save" mean those who are not in the knowledges of good and truth but yet long for them (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/238.htm">238</a>; "the gold of Sheba, of which He shall give them," means the good of love into which the Lord shall lead them by means of knowledges (what "Sheba" signifies see just above).</p><p>[19] In Haggai:<p>I will stir up all nations, that they may come, the choice of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory. The silver is Mine, and the gold. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3720.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3720</a>); "the glory with which it shall be filled" means Divine truth (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4809.htm">4809</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8267.htm">8267</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8427.htm">8427</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9429.htm">9429</a>). "The silver is Mine, and the gold," means that truth and good are from the Lord alone.</p><p>[20] In Zechariah:<p>The wealth of all nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_14.htm">Zechariah 14:14</a>).<p>"The wealth of all nations" means knowledges, wheresoever they are, even with the evil; "gold, silver, and garments, in great abundance," mean goods and truths, spiritual and natural. The like was signified by:<p>The gold, silver, and garments that the sons of Israel borrowed from the Egyptians, when they went away from them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_3_22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_11_2.htm">11:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_11_3.htm">3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>).<p>Why this was done, and what it involves, may be seen in The <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_29.htm">29</a>; and in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_24.htm">Luke 19:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_26.htm">26</a>); and that they should make to themselves friends by the unrighteous mammon (according to the words of the Lord in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). "The unrighteous mammon" means the knowledges of truth and good with those who do not possess them justly, who are those that do not apply them to life.</p><p>[21] In David:<p>Kings' daughters are among thy precious ones; at Thy right hand stood the queen in the best gold of Ophir. The king's daughter is all glorious within; her vesture is inwrought with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_13.htm">13</a>).<p>This treats of the Lord; and "a king's daughter" means the church that is in the affection of truth, which is described by "kings' daughters are among His precious ones," which means the affections of truths themselves; "at His right hand doth stand the queen in the best gold of Ophir" means the Lord's celestial kingdom, which is in the good of love; "her vesture is inwrought with gold" means that its truths are from good.</p><p>[22] In Matthew:<p>Jesus said to His disciples whom He sent forth to preach the gospel, that they should possess no gold, nor silver, nor brass in their purses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_9.htm">Matthew 10:9</a>);<p>by this was represented that they should have nothing of good and truth from themselves, but only from the Lord, and that all things would be given them freely. Because "gold" signified the good of love:<p>The table on which the shewbread was placed was overlaid with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_23.htm">Exodus 25:23-24</a>);<p>Likewise the altar of incense, which was thence called the golden altar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_3.htm">Exodus 30:3</a>);<p>For the same reason the lampstand was made of pure gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_38.htm">38</a>);<p>Also the cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a>);<p>And for the same reason the ark was overlaid within and without with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>);<p>Likewise many things in the temple at Jerusalem.<p>For the tabernacle, in which were the ark, the cherubim, the table on which was the shewbread, the altar of incense, and the lampstand, represented heaven, and so did the temple; therefore the gold therein signified the good of love, and the silver truth from good.</p><p>[23] As what is most holy in heaven was represented by the gold in the temple:<p>When Belshazzar drank wine out of the vessels of gold brought out of that temple, and at the same time praised the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone, there appeared written on the wall: Numbered, weighed, divided; and in that night he was slain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>);<p>for thereby was signified the profanation of good.</p><p>[24] Moreover "gold" in the Word in a contrary sense signifies the evil of self-love, and "silver" the falsity therefrom. As in Moses:<p>The silver and gold of the nations they shall not covet, for they are abominations, nor bring them into their houses, but they shall be accursed, because they are to be abhorred and abominated (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_7_25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>).<p>But this signification of "gold" and "silver" shall be spoken of further on.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For "is to know" the Latin has "and to know."<br><br>2.&nbsp;For "received by all" the Latin has "received that by all."<br><br>3.&nbsp;For "and what is his own" the context requires "from what is his own.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 242 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>242. "Emere a Me aurum exploratum igne ut ditatus sis." - Quod significet ut a Domino comparent sibi genuinum bonum ut recipere possint vera fidei, constat ex significatione "emere", quod sit comparare et appropriare sibi (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4397" target=_top>4397</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5374" target=_top>5374</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5397" target=_top>5397</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5406" target=_top>5406</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5410" target=_top>5410</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5426" target=_top>5426</a>); ex significatione "auri explorati igne", quod sit bonum genuinum, ita bonum a Domino (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "ut ditatus sis", quod sit ut recipere possit vera fidei. <p>Quod "ditatus fieri" id significet, est quia "divitiae" et "opes" significant cognitiones veri et boni, et "divites" illos qui in intelligentia per illas sunt, hic qui in fide per illas, quia hic de illis qui in doctrina de sola fide sunt, agitur. Inde patet quod per "emere a Me aurum exploratum igne ut ditatus sis", significetur ut comparent sibi genuinum bonum a Domino, ut recipere possint vera fidei.<p>[2] Quomodo haec intelligenda sunt, primum dicetur. Quod non detur verum quod verum in se est nisi ex bono, ita nec fides quae fides nisi ex charitate, saepius prius dictum est: verum enim quod in se verum est, non datur nisi vita spiritualis ei insit; et tunc vita spiritualis ei inest dum formatur ex bono charitatis; nam verum est forma boni, et bonum est esse veri, ita quoque est vita ejus, et bonum non aliunde est quam a Domino; et cum bonum a Domino est, tum verum quod ex bono est spectat Dominum primario, et quoque proximum et ejus bonum; nam Dominus influit cum bono, et ex ea format verum, quod est verum fidei, ac facit ut visus spiritualis hominis spectet ad Ipsum et ad proximum. (Quod ita sit, Ostensum videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_145" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 145</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_251" target=_top>251</a>, quod nempe Dominus aspiciat angelos et homines in fronte, et hi Dominum per oculos, ex causa quia frons correspondet bono amoris, ac oculi intellectui inde illustrato, proinde veris quae fidei sunt; et quoque in eodem opere, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_123" target=_top>123</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_124" target=_top>124</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_142" target=_top>142-144</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_510" target=_top>510</a>, ostensum est quod in mundo spirituali omnes vertantur ad suos amores, et illi qui Dominum agnoverunt et in Ipsum crediderunt, vertantur ad Ipsum, et quod inde illis bonum, et per bonum illustratio quoad vera, ) Ex his constare potest quid genuinum bonum quod significatur per "aurum exploratum igne", quod nempe a Solo Domino.<p>[3] Quoniam in scriptis ad Angelum hujus Ecclesiae agitur de illis qui vivunt secundum doctrinam de sola fide, et quia illi qui se confirmaverunt in illa, qui in mundo inde docti vocati sunt, potuerunt connectere falsa veris, ac inducere apparentiam sicut vera esset doctrina, ideo datum est cum quibusdam ex illis in altera vita loqui; et quia illa quae tunc mutuo dicta sunt, possunt inservire illustrationi, velim ea afferre. Docti illi ex opinione in mundo putaverunt quod fides esset dabilis absque charitate, et quod homo justificetur per illam solam. Sermo eorum erat admodum ingeniosus, dicendo quod fides absque charitate dabilis sit, ex causa quia prior est, et per illam homo in bono est. "Quis", dixerunt, "non credere potest quod Deus sit? quod Verbum sit Divinum? et similia, quae nisi crederentur non possent recipi et cogitari ab homine." Concluserunt inde quod fides dabilis sit absque charitate quia praecedit seu prior est; et si dabilis, quod salvans sit, quia homo non potest bonum facere a se; quare nisi illa salvaret omnes perirent: absque fide nec daretur praesentia Dei apud illum; et si non praesentia Dei, regnaret malum et non alicui esset bonum. Haec dixerunt intelligi per justificationem per solam fidem. Sed ostensum illis est quod non fides esset nisi simul charitas; et quod dixerunt esse fidem, esse solum cognitiones, quae primae sunt cuivis homini, ut quod Deus sit, et quod Verbum sit Divinum, ac similia; et quod illae cognitiones non sint in homine, sed in introitu ad illum, qui est ejus memoria, priusquam sunt in ejus voluntate; et quantum in ejus voluntate sunt, tantum in ipso homine, nam voluntas est ipse homo; et quantum in voluntate sunt, tantum in ejus visu sunt, qui est fides. Ipsae cognitiones quae praecedunt, ac in visu naturali apparent sicut credi, non prius fiunt fidei; inde est quod visus cognitionum, qui putatur esse fidei, recedat ab homine successive prout is incipit male cogitare ex male velle, et quoque recedit ab illo post mortem cum homo fit spiritus, si non cognitiones irradicatae sunt vitae ejus, hoc est, voluntati aut amori ejus.<p>[4] Illustretur hoc per comparationem cum ventriculis qui apud aves et apud animalia terrae, qui vocantur ventriculi ruminatorii: in hos primum colligunt escas suas, et dein per gradus exsumunt illas, ac edunt, et sic nutriunt sanguinern; ita fiunt vitae eorum. Ventriculis illis correspondet memoria apud hominem; hac gaudet homo loco illorum, quia homo est spiritualis; in hanc primum colligit cibos spirituales, qui sunt cognitiones, et dein exsumit illas quasi ruminando, hoc est, cogitando et volendo, et appropriat sibi, et sic facit vitae suae. Ex hac comparatione, tametsi levi, constare potest quod cognitiones nisi implantentur vitae per cogitare et velle illas et inde facere illas, similes sint escis non comesis in ventriculis ruminatoriis, ubi vel putrescunt vel evomuntur. Praeterea circulus vitae hominis <sup>1</sup></p><p>est scire, intelligere, velle et facere; incohat enim vita spiritualis hominis a scire, dein continuatur in intelligere, postea in velle, et demum in facere. Unde quoque patet quod cognitiones sint modo in introitu ad vitam cum in memoria, et quod non plene in homine sint quam cum in factis, ac eo plenius in factis quo plenius in intellectu et voluntate.<p>[5] Porro ostensum est quod fides cognitionum, antequam fit fides vitae, sit fides historica; quae qualis sit notum est, quod nempe credatur ita esse quia alius dixerat: hoc antequam fit ipsius hominis est alienum seu alius hominis apud se; et quoque est talis fides historica qualis est fides rerum ignotarum; nam dicitur quod credenda sint tametsi non intelliguntur, immo quod non perscrutanda sint intellectu, cum tamen fides spiritualis talis est ut in illa ipsa vera videantur, et sic credantur. In caelo nemo credit aliquod verum nisi videat aut viderit illud; dicunt enim, "Quis potest credere quod ita sit nisi videat? forte potest esse falsum": et credere falsum non possunt alii quam mali, nam mali ex malo vident falsa, at boni ex bono vident vera; et quia bonum est a Domino, etiam visus veri ex bono est a Domino. Quod angeli videant vera, est quia lux caeli, in qua sunt, est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino; inde <sup>2</sup></p><p>omnibus apud quos illa lux est, etiam in mundo, est visus veri. (De Luce Caeli, et quod talis sit, videatur in opere De Caelo et Inferno, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_126" target=_top>126-140</a>.)<p>[6] Ostensum dein est quod charitas et fides unum agant, ac intrent simul apud hominem; ita quantum homo in charitate est tantum in fide sit, quoniam fides quoad essentiam est charitas, prorsus sicut verum quoad essentiam est bonum; bonum enim dum existit in specie seu in forma est verum: ita charitas est fides, nam bonum est charitatis et verum est fidei; unum etiam amat alterum et se conjungit alteri; quare non datur unum nisi simul alterum. Illustratum est hoc per hominis cogitationem quae ejus intellectus, et per affectionem quae ejus voluntatis: cogitare absque affectione est impossibile, ipsa enim essentia cogitationis est affectio seu amor; cogitare quidem potest homo omnia illa quae scit ex doctrina ecclesiae, sed ex affectione naturali, quae est affectio seu amor gloriae, famae, honoris, lucri; sed haec affectio non facit ut cogitatio sit spiritualis, verum erit charitas quae est ipsa affectio spiritualis: haec cum se conjungit cognitionibus, fit fides, et dein quantum homo in illa affectione est tantum videt cogitatione illa quae sunt fidei ejus, quae vocantur vera, et agnoscit illa, quia sunt ex ipso spiritu ejus, ita ex ipsa vita spirituali ejus. Hoc quoque est quod vocatur illustratio; inde est quod nemo illustrari possit ex Verbo nisi in affectione veri spirituali sit. Datur quidem simile illustrationi apud illos qui se confirmaverunt in talibus quae sunt doctrinae de sola fide et de justificatione per illam; sed illa illustratio est illustratio fatua, quoniam possunt falsa aeque ac vera confirmari, sicut omnes haereses tam quae regnant apud Judaeos quam quae apud Pontificios; etiam similis lux post confirmationes datur apud illos qui naturalistae vocantur, ac negant Deum et Divinum Verbi, et praeterea omnia ecclesiae; similiter apud illos qui confirmarunt apud se solam fidem et justificationem per illam. (Quod lux confirmationis sit lux naturalis, non spiritualis, dabilis etiam apud malos, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8780" target=_top>8780</a>.)<p>[7] Sed redeamus ad fidem quae quoad essentiam est charitas. Illa fides jugiter perficitur per talia quae confirmant, nam semper ex luce spirituali videntur vera plura, et haec omnia se conjungunt bono charitatis et id perficiunt; inde homini est intelligentia et sapientia, tandem angelica. Praeterea illi qui solum in cognitionibus fidei sunt, et non in vita secundum illas, credunt quod homo facile possit recipere fidem, si non in mundo usque in altera vita; dicentes secum, "Annon cum audio et video quod ita sit, possum credere?" Sed maxime falluntur, nam illi qui non fidem spiritualem receperunt in mundo, postea, si millies audiverint et viderint, nusquam possunt recipere; causa est quia fides illa non est in homine sed extra illum: quod ita sit manifeste constare potest ex eo, quod omnes qui e mundo veniunt primum recipiantur ab angelis et a bonis spiritibus, ac omni modo instruantur; immo etiam plura illis ostenduntur ad vivum et ad visum, sed usque non recipiunt; quare se ab illis abalienant, et accedunt ad illos qui in nulla fide sunt.<p>[8] Dictum etiam est illis quod si reciperetur fides per solum scire et cogitare, <sup>3</sup></p><p>ab omnibus aeque malis ac bonis reciperetur, et sic nemo damnaretur. Quod charitas, quae est affectio spiritualis, nusquam dabilis sit apud aliquem nisi sciat vera, exploret se secundum illa, recipiat illa, et novam vitam illis convenientem agat, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_239" target=_top>239</a>). Inde sequitur quod vita fidei sit charitas, et quod nihil vitae insit fidei nisi quantum charitatis inest, et quoque quod quantum charitatis inest fidei, tantum ducatur a Domino; at quod quantum charitatis non inest tantum ducatur a semet; et qui ducitur a semet et non a Domino, non cogitare potest bonum, minus velle et facere bonum quod bonum in se est, nam ex proprio hominis non procedit nisi quam malum: cum enim cogitat bonum ac vult et facit bonum <sup>4</sup></p><p>ex proprio, est modo propter se, et propter mundum, quae sunt fines operum ejus, ac fines sunt amores qui ducunt illum: et homo a proprio suo non abduci seu elevari potest, nisi, quoad illa quae vitae sunt, spectet ad Dominum; per hunc visum conjungitur ille caelo, et inde a Domino datur ei affectio spiritualis. Cum haec et illa dicta sunt, datum est illis, cum quibus de hac re locutus sum, in luce spirituali esse; quae lux talis est, ut in illa videri possint vera tam clare sicut videntur objecta in mundo in luce ejus; et tunc illi qui in doctrina de sola fide et de justificatione per illam erant, non potuerunt non affirmare quod ita sit; sed ut primum lux ea illis adempta est, et remissi sunt in suam lucem, quae erat naturalis, non potuerunt videre aliter quam quod visus cognitionum esset fides salvans, et inde quod falsa, quae fecerunt fidei suae, essent vera. Falsa fiunt fidei quando mala sunt vitae.<p>[9] Sed redeamus ad explicationem verborum hujus loci, quae sunt, "Suadeo tibi emere a Me aurum exploratum igne ut ditatus sis"; per quae significatur ut comparent sibi a Domino genuinum bonum ut recipere possint vera. Et nunc ostendendum est quod "aurum" in Verbo significet bonum amoris. Hoc constare potest a sequentibus his locis:<p> – Apud Malachiam,<p>"Ecce Ego mittens angelum meum qui praeparabit viam ante Me, et subito veniet ad Templum suum Dominus quem vos quaeritis, et Angelus foederis quem vos desideratis;...sedebit conflans et purgans argentum, et purificabit filios Levi, et defaecabit eos sicut aurum et argentum, ut sint adferentes Jehovae mincham in justitia" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1-3" target=_top>3:1-3</a>);<p>haec de adventu Domini dicta sunt: dicitur quod Jehovah missurus "angelum qui parabit viam ante Ipsum", et per "angelum" intelligitur Johannes Baptista, ut notum est;
