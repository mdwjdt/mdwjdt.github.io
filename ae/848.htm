<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 848</h4><p>848. CHAPTER 14.<p>1. AND I saw, and, lo, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.<p>2. And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.<p>3. And they sang, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four animals, and the elders; and no man could learn the song, but the hundred forty and four thousand, redeemed from the earth.<p>4. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and unto the Lamb.<p>5. And in their mouth was found no guile; for they are without blemish before the throne of God.<p>6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<p>7. Saying, with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory unto him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<p>8. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.<p>9. And the third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worship the beast, and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,<p>10. The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur before the holy angels, and before the Lamb:<p>11. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth unto ages of ages; and they shall not rest day and night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<p>12. Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.<p>13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them.<p>14. And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.<p>15. And another angel went out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat upon the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap; for the hour is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.<p>16. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.<p>17. And another angel went out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<p>18. And another angel went out from the altar, having power over fire; and cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the vintage of the clusters of the vineyard of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.<p>19. And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the clusters of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.<p>20. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, from a thousand and six hundred furlongs.<p>EXPLANATION.<p>VERSE 1. And I saw, and, lo, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written on their foreheads.<p>"And I saw," signifies a manifestation concerning the future separation of the good from the evil before the Last Judgment; "and, lo, the Lamb standing on mount Zion," signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church in order to separate the good from the evil and accomplish the judgment; "and with him a hundred forty and four thousand," signifies according to truths in their whole extent; "having his Father's name written on their foreheads," signifies those truths according to the acknowledgment of His Divine from love. </p>

And they were singing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four animals and the elders: and no one was able to learn the song save the hundred forty-four thousand, those bought from the earth.<p>4. These are they that were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. These were bought from among men, first fruits to God and the Lamb.<p>5. And in their mouth was found no guile; for they are spotless before the throne of God.<p>6.

And He that sat upon the cloud cast His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.<p>17. And another angel went out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle;<p>18. And another angel went out from the altar, having authority over the fire; and he cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vineyard <sup>3</sup>of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened.<p>19. And the angel cast his sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great wine-press of the anger of God.<p>20.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 848 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>848. CAPUT XIV.<p>1. Et vidi, et ecce Agnus stans super Monte Sion, et cum Ipso centum quadraginta quatuor millia, habentes nomen Patris Ipsius scriptum super frontibus suis.<p>2. Et audivi vocem e caelo, tanquam vocem aquarum multarum, et tanquam vocem tonitrui magni: et vocem audivi citharaedorum pulsantium citharis suis.<p>3. Et canebant tanquam canticum novum coram throno, et coram quatuor animalibus, et senioribus; et nemo potuit discere canticum, nisi quam illi centum quadraginta quatuor millia, empti de terra.<p>4. Hi sunt qui cum mulieribus non sunt inquinati, virgines enim sunt; hi sunt qui sequentes Agnum, quocunque vadit: hi empti sunt de hominibus, primitiae Deo et Agno.<p>5. Et in ore illorum non est inventus dolus, immaculati enim sunt coram throno Dei.<p>6. Et vidi alium angelum volantem in medio caeli, habentem Evangelium aeternum, evangelizare habitantibus super terra, et omni genti et tribui et linguae et populo.<p>7. Dicentem voce magna, Timete Deum, et date Ipsi gloriam, quia venit hora judicii Ipsius, et adorate Ipsum qui fecit caelum et terram, et mare et fontes aquarum.<p>8. Et alius angelus secutus est, dicens, Cecidit, cecidit Babylon, urbs illa magna, quia ex vino irae scortationis suae potavit omnes gentes.<p>9. Et tertius angelus secutus est illos, dicens voce magna, si quis bestiam adoraverit, et imaginem ejus, et acceperit characterem super fronte sua et super manu sua.<p>10. Et ille bibet ex vino irae Dei mixto mero in poculo excandescentiae Ipsius, et cruciabitur igne et sulphure coram sanctis angelis et coram Agno.<p>11. Et fumus cruciatus illorum ascendet in saecula saeculorum, et non habebunt requiem diu et noctu adorantes bestiam et imaginem ejus, et si quis acceperit characterem nominis ejus.<p>12. Hic patientia sanctorum est; hic custodientes mandata Dei et fidem Jesu.<p>13. Et audivi vocem e caelo dicentem mihi, Scribe, Beati mortui in Domino morientes a nunc; immo dicit Spiritus, ut requiescant ex laboribus suis; opera enim illorum sequuntur cum illis.<p>14. Et vidi, et ecce nubes alba, et super nube sedens similis Filio hominis, habens super capite suo coronam auream, <sup>1</sup></p><p>et in manu sua falcem acutam. <sup>2</sup></p><p>15. Et alius angelus exivit e templo, clamans magna voce sedenti super nube, Mitte falcem tuam et mete, quia venit Tibi hora metendi, quia aruit messis terrae.<p>16. Et misit sedens super nube falcem suam super terram, et demessa est terra.<p>17. Et alius angelus exivit e templo quod in caelo, habens et ille falcem acutam.<p>18. Et alius angelus exivit ex altari, habens potestatem super ignem, et clamavit clamore magno habenti falcem acutam, dicens, Mitte tuam falcem acutam, et vindemia botros vineae <sup>3</sup></p><p>terrae, quia maturuerunt uvae ejus.<p>19. Et misit angelus falcem suam in terram, et vindemiavit vineam terrae, et conjecit in torcular irae Dei magnum.<p>20. Et calcatum est torcular extra urbem, et exivit sanguis e torculari usque ad frena equorum, a stadiis mille sexcentis.<p>[NOTAE AUCTORIS:] <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here..
