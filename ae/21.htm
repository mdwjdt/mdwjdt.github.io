<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 21</h4><p>21. In Asia. That this signifies those who are in the light of intelligence, is evident only from a spiritual idea, such as the angels have, concerning the regions of this earth. When Asia is named, they have a perception of the south, when Europe, the north, and when Africa, the east. And because by the south is signified the clear light of intelligence, therefore that light is signified by Asia. This perception has been granted me also, whenever I have been in a spiritual idea and thought of Asia. The reason such is the idea concerning Asia is, that the church was there in ancient times, being then extended throughout many regions in that quarter, and therefore those who have come thence into heaven, have the light of intelligence. This is why when Asia is thought of there is an influx of light, like that in the south of heaven. (That in ancient, and also in the most ancient times, the church was in Asia, and extended throughout many kingdoms there, may be seen in the quotations from Arcana Coelestia in the small work, <a href="../njhd/247.htm">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine 247</a>; and that the south signifies the light of intelligence may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>, where the four quarters in heaven are treated of.) In this place, however, by Asia are not meant the inhabitants of Asia, but all, wherever they are, who have the spiritual light of intelligence, or, what is the same thing, who are in truths from good; for those who are in truths from good have the spiritual light of intelligence; all such constitute the church of the Lord. (That the church of the Lord exists also among the Gentiles, although specifically where the Lord is known and where the Word is read, may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/318.htm">Heaven and Hell 318-328</a>; and <a href="../njhd/244.htm">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine 244</a>, <a href="../njhd/246.htm">246</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 21</h4><p>21. In Asia, signifies those who are in the light of intelligence. This can be seen by a spiritual idea only, such as angels have, concerning the regions of this earth. When Asia is named, angels perceive the south; when Europe is named, the north; and when Africa, the east; and as by the "south" is signified the clear light of intelligence, so that light is signified by "Asia." This perception has been granted also to me, as often as I have been in the spiritual idea and have thought of Asia. Such is the spiritual idea of Asia, because the church was there in ancient times, and then extended over many regions there; therefore, those who are in heaven from that country are in the light of intelligence. For this reason, when Asia is thought of, a light like that which is in the south of heaven flows in. (That in ancient times, and also in the most ancient, the church was in Asia, extending through many kingdoms there, see the quotations from the Arcana Coelestia in the little work on <a href="../njhd/247.htm">The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine 247</a>; and that the "south" signifies the light of intelligence, see in the work on <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>, where the Four Quarters in Heaven are treated of.) By "Asia," however, the inhabitants of Asia are not here meant, but all, wheresoever they are, who are in the spiritual light of intelligence, or, what is the same, who are in truths from good; for those who are in truths from good are in the spiritual light of intelligence; and all such constitute the Lord's church.<p>(That the Lord's church exists also among the Gentiles, although specifically where the Lord is known and the Word is read, see in the work on <a href="../hh/318.htm">Heaven and Hell 318-328</a>; and on <a href="../njhd/244.htm">The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine 244</a>, <a href="../njhd/246.htm">246</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 21 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>21. "In Asia." - Quod significet illos qui in luce intelligentiae non constare potest aliunde quam ex idea spirituali, qualis est angelorum, de regionibus hujus telluris; illi cum nominatur Asia percipiunt meridiem, cum nominatur Europa percipiunt septentrionem, et cum Africa percipiunt orientem; et quia per "meridiem" significatur lux intelligentiae clara, ideo per "Asiam" illa lux significatur; hoc quoque mihi datum est percipere, quoties in idea spirituali fui et cogitavi de Asia. Quod talis idea de Asia sit, est quia ecclesia ibi antiquis temporibus fuit, tunc extensa per plures regiones ibi; et ideo illi qui inde in caelo sunt in luce intelligentiae sunt; unde est, cum cogitatur de Asia, quod lux, qualis est in meridie caeli, influat. (Quod antiquis temporibus, et quoque antiquissimis, ecclesia fuerit in Asia, extensa per plura regna ibi, videatur ex Arcanis Caelestibus in opusculo De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_21/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_1147" target=_top>1147</a>; et quod "meridies" significet lucem intelligentiae, in opere De Caeli et Inferno, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_21/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_141" target=_top>141-153</a>, ubi agitur De Quatuor Plagis in Caelo.) Verum usque per "Asiam" hic non intelliguntur illi qui in Asia, sed omnes, ubicunque sunt, qui in luce intelligentiae spirituali, sive, quod idem, qui in veris ex bono sunt; qui enim in veris ex bono sunt, in luce intelligentiae spirituali sunt; illi omnes ecclesiam Domini constituunt. (Quod ecclesia Domini etiam apud gentes sit, tametsi in specie ubi Dominus notus est et Verbum legitur, videatur in opere De Caelo et Inferno n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_21/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_318" target=_top>318-328</a>; et De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_21/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_244" target=_top>244</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_21/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1146" target=_top>1146</a>.) </p>
