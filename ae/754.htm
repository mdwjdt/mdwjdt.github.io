<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 754</h4><p>754. Having great anger.- That this signifies hatred against spiritual truths and goods, which are of faith and life from the Word, consequently against those who are in them, is plain from the signification of great anger as meaning, in reference to the devil, hatred. For anger, when said of the Lord, signifies zeal, within which there is nevertheless heaven, but when said in reference to the devil it denotes hatred, in which inwardly there is hell. That these and many other things are signified by anger and wrath may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/413.htm">413</a>, <a href="../ae/481.htm">481</a> at the end, 647, 693). The hatred of the devil is against spiritual truths and goods, because merely natural truths and goods are altogether opposite to these, for merely natural truths and goods are, in their essence, falsities and evils, although to those who are merely natural and sensual they appear to be truths and goods, because their goods are pleasures and delights springing from the loves of self and the world, and their truths are such as give countenance to those goods. And as the loves of self and the world are from hell, therefore, in their essence, they are evils and falsities. But spiritual truths and goods are in their essence truths and goods, because the goods are delights springing from love to the Lord, and from love towards the neighbour, and the truths are those which teach those goods; and as these truths and goods are from the Lord through heaven, therefore they are called spiritual, for everything which proceeds from the Lord is called spiritual. And since a man cannot receive these truths and goods unless he believes them and does them, it is therefore said, which are of faith and life from the Word. To live from the Word is to live from the Lord, for the Lord is in the Word, indeed He is the Word.</p><p>[2] Now because merely natural truths and goods, which in their essence are falsities and evils, are altogether opposite to spiritual truths and goods, which in their essence are truths and goods, therefore the devil, by whom hell is meant, is in unceasing hatred against them. This is why hatreds of various kinds continually ascend from the hells, while on the other hand, spiritual loves, also of various kinds, descend from the heavens; and between the hatreds of the hells and the loves of the heavens there is an equilibrium, in which men in the world are held, in order that they may be able to act from freedom according to reason. Those therefore, who do not live from the Word, but from the world, since they remain natural, receive evils and thus falsities from hell, and conceive from them hatred against spiritual truths and goods. Their hatred does not indeed appear in the world, because it lies concealed interiorly in their spirit, but it is manifested after death, when they become spirits. They then burn against those who are in spiritual truths and goods, with a hatred too great to be described; it is indeed a deadly hatred, for as soon as they see an angel who is in such truths and goods, in fact, if they only hear the Lord named, who is the source of these goods and truths, they immediately rush into passionate hatred, and feel nothing to be more delightful than to persecute them, and do evil to them; and because they are not able to destroy their bodies, they try with intense passion to destroy their souls.</p><p>[3] The reason why it is said, "Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down unto you having great anger," is that, after the Last Judgment, the state of the spiritual world was altogether changed. Before the Last Judgment those who were able to live a civil and moral life in externals, and yet were not spiritual, were allowed to form for themselves imaginary heavens, and there to enjoy pleasures like those in the world. But since the accomplishment of the Last Judgment this is no longer permitted, for now every one according to his life is carried away - he who is merely natural to hell, and he who is spiritual to heaven. This is the signification of the dragon and his angels being cast out of heaven unto the earth, namely, that previous to this they were permitted to have conjunction with the angels who were in the ultimate heavens, and in consequence of this to form for themselves such heavens, but now this is no longer permitted. This therefore is what is specifically meant by hatred against those who are in spiritual truths and goods; and such hatred is signified by the great anger which the devil has against those that inhabit the earth and the sea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 754</h4><p>754. Having great anger, signifies hatred against spiritual truths and goods, which are of faith and life from the Word, consequently against those who are in them. This is evident from the signification of "great anger," as being, in reference to the devil, hatred. For in reference to the Lord "anger" signifies zeal, which however has heaven within it; but in reference to the devil it means hatred, which has hell within it. That these and many other things are signified by "anger" and "wrath" may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/413.htm">413</a>, <a href="../ae/481.htm">481</a>, <a href="../ae/647.htm">647</a>, <a href="../ae/693.htm">693</a>). The devil's hatred is against spiritual truths and goods, because merely natural truths and goods are the direct opposites of these, for merely natural truths and goods are in their essence falsities and evils, although to those who are merely natural and sensual they appear to be truths and goods; because their goods are pleasures and delights flowing from the loves of self and the world, and their truths are whatever favor those goods; consequently as the loves of self and of the world are from hell, these goods and truths are in their essence evils and falsities. But spiritual truths and goods are in their essence truths and goods, because these goods are delights flowing from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbor, and spiritual truths are what teach these goods; and these truths and goods are called spiritual because they are from the Lord through heaven, since everything that proceeds from the Lord is called spiritual. And since these truths and goods cannot be received by man unless he believes them and does them, it is added, which are of faith and life from the Word. To live from the Word is to live from the Lord, for the Lord is in the Word, yea, He is the Word.</p><p>[2] Now as merely natural truths and goods, which in their essence are falsities and evils, are altogether opposite to spiritual truths and goods, which in their essence are truths and goods, therefore the devil, by whom is meant hell, is in unceasing hatred against them. This is why hatreds of various kinds are unceasingly ascending from the hells; while on the other hand, spiritual loves also of various kinds descend from the heavens, and between the hatreds of the hells and the loves of the heavens there is an equilibrium, in which the men in the world are held, in order that they may be able to act from freedom according to reason. Consequently those who do not live from the Word but from the world, since they continue natural, receive evils and the falsities thence from hell, and conceive from them hatred against spiritual truths and goods. Their hatred does not appear in the world, because it lies concealed inwardly in their spirit; but it becomes manifest after death, when they become spirits. Then they burn against those who are in spiritual truths and goods with a hatred so great that it cannot be described; it is indeed a deadly hatred; for as soon as they see an angel who is in these truths and goods, or if they merely hear the Lord named, from whom these truths and goods are, they instantly come into a fury of hatred, and feel nothing more delightful than to pursue them and to do evil to them. And as they are unable to slay their body they endeavor with a burning heart to slay their soul.</p><p>[3] It is said, "Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down unto you having great anger," because after the Last Judgment the state of the spiritual world was altogether changed. Before the Last Judgment those who were able to live a civil and moral life in externals, although they were not spiritual, were permitted to form for themselves seeming heavens, and to enjoy there pleasures like those in the world; but after the Last Judgment was accomplished this is no longer permitted, for now everyone according to his life is carried off, he who is merely natural to hell and he who is spiritual to heaven. This also is the meaning of the words, "the dragon and his angels were cast out of heaven into the earth," namely, that before this it was granted them to have conjunction with the angels who were in the lowest heavens, and because of this to form for themselves such heavens; but now this is no longer permitted. This, then, is what is meant particularly by the hatred against those who are in spiritual truths and goods, which hatred is signified by the "great anger" that the devil has against "those that inhabit the earth and the sea." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 754 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>754. "Habens iram magnam." - Quod significet odium contra vera et bona spiritualia, quae sunt fidei et vitae ex Verbo, proinde contra eos qui in illis sunt, constat ex significatione "irae magnae", cum de diabolo, quod sit odium: "ira" enim, cum de Domino, significat zelum, in quo tamen intus est caelum; at cum de diabolo, est odium, in quo intus est infernum; quod haec et plura alia per "iram" et "excandescentiam" significentur, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_754/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_413" target=_top>413</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_754/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_481" target=_top>481</a> fin., <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_754/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_647" target=_top>647</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_754/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_693" target=_top>693</a>). Quod odium diaboli sit contra vera et bona spiritualia, est quia vera et bona mere naturalia sunt illis prorsus opposita; vera enim et bona mere naturalia sunt in sua essentia falsa et mala, tametsi coram illis qui mere naturales et sensuales sunt, apparent sicut vera et bona, quia bona eorum sunt voluptates et jucunditates scaturientes ex amoribus sui et mundi, et vera eorum sunt quae illis bonis favent; et quia amores sui et mundi ex inferno sunt, ideo in sua essentia sunt mala et falsa. At vera et bona spiritualia in sua essentia sunt vera et bona, quia bona sunt jucunditates scaturientes ex amore in Dominium et ex amore erga proximum, et vera sunt quae illa bona docent; et quia haec vera et bona per caelum ex Domino sunt, ideo vocantur spiritualia, omne enim id quod procedit ex Domino spirituale vocatur: et quoniam homo haec vera et bona non recipere potest, nisi illa credat et illa faciat, ideo additur, quae sunt fidei et vitae ex Verbo: vivere ex Verbo est vivere ex Domino, nam Dominus est in Verbo, immo est Verbum.<p>[2] Nunc quia vera et bona mere naturalia, quae in sua essentia sunt falsa et mala, prorsus opposita sunt veris et bonis spiritualibus, quae in sua essentia sunt vera et bona, ideo diabolus, per quem intelligitur infernum, in continuo odio est, contra ea: inde est quod ex infernis odia varii generis continuo ascendant, et vicissim ex caelis amores spirituales etiam varii generis descendant; et quod inter odia infernorum et inter amores caelorum sit aequilibrium, in quo homines in mundo tenentur, ob causam ut ex libero secundum rationem possint agere: quapropter qui non vivunt ex Verbo, sed ex mundo, illi quia naturales manent, recipiunt ex inferno mala et inde falsa, et ex illis concipiunt odium contra vera et bona spiritualia. Odium quidem illorum non apparet in mundo, quia latet intus in spiritu eorum reconditum, at manifestatur post mortem, quando spiritus fiunt; tunc contra illos qui in veris et bonis spiritualibus sunt, tanto odio flagrant ut non describi possit; est odium internecinum: ut primum enim vident angelum, qui in illis veris et bonis est, immo si modo audiunt nominari Dominum, a quo illa vera et bona sunt, illico in furores odii veniunt, ac nihil jucundius sentiunt quam persequi illos, malefacere illis; et quia non trucidare corpus eorum possunt, flagrante corde trucidare animam eorum conantur.<p>[3] Quod dicatur, "Vae habitantibus terram et mare, quia descendit diabolus ad vos, habens iram magnam", est quia post ultimum judicium status mundi spiritualis prorsus mutatus est; ante illud judicium permissum fuit illis qui civilem et moralem vitam in externis potuerunt agere, tametsi non spirituales essent, sibi tanquam caelos formare, et ibi frui voluptatibus qualibus in mundo; at postquam ultimum judicium peractum est, tunc non amplius id permittitur, nunc enim unusquisque fertur secundum vitam suam, qui mere naturalis est, ad infernum, et qui spiritualis ad caelum; hoc quoque est, quod "draco et angeli ejus e caelo projecti sint in terram"; nempe quod prius datum sit illis conjunctionem habere cum angelis qui in caelis ultimis erant, et propterea sibi tales caelos formare; nunc id non amplius conceditur. Hoc itaque est quod in specie intelligitur per odium contra illos qui in veris et bonis spiritualibus sunt, quod odium significatur per "iram magnam" quam habet diabolus contra inhabitantes terram et mare. </p>
