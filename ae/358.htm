<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 358</h4><p>358. And a crown was given unto him. That this signifies life eternal, which is the reward of victory, is manifest from the signification of a crown, which, when spiritual combat is treated of, as in this case, denotes life eternal, which is the reward of victory. That spiritual combat is here treated of, is clear from what precedes and follows. In what precedes it is said, that He who sat upon the white horse had a bow, and by a bow is signified the doctrine of charity and faith, from which evils and falsities are fought against and dispersed. And also from what follows, in which it is said, and "He went forth conquering, and to conquer," by which is signified victory over them; hence by the crown is here signified life eternal, which is the reward of victory.</p><p>[2] The same is signified by a crown, where temptations are treated of, because temptations are spiritual combats, as in the second chapter of this book, where these [words occur]:<p>"Behold, it shall be that the devil will cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tempted; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life" (verse 10).<p>That wisdom and eternal happiness are here signified by a crown, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/126.htm">126</a>). Wisdom and eternal happiness taken together are life eternal, for in wisdom and eternal happiness the very life of heaven consists. The same is signified by the crown of the martyrs, because they were in tribulation, and were faithful even to death, and were also in temptations, and conquered; crowns were also given to them after death, but lest they should thence arrogate honour to themselves, and thus contract haughtiness, they cast them off from their heads. Because by wars in the Word are signified wars in a spiritual sense, which are combats against evils and falsities, and by kings are signified truths from good which fight against them; hence, in ancient times, when men were in the knowledge of correspondences and representations, the kings in their battles had a crown upon the head, and a bracelet upon the arm; as is evident from the second book of Samuel:</p><p>[3] The boy the son of an Amalekite, who told David that Saul and Jonathan were dead, said, "I came upon mount Gilboa, when behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and leaders followed hard after him. And he called to me, Come and slay me. And I stood against him, and slew him, and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I bring them to thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3105.htm">3105</a>. What further the crowns of kings signify, and crowns in general, see n. 272.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 358</h4><p>358. And a crown was given [unto Him], signifies eternal life which is the reward of victory. This is evident from the signification of "crown," as being, when spiritual combat is treated of, as here, eternal life which is the reward of victory. That spiritual combat is here treated of is evident from what precedes and follows; in what precedes it is said that "He that sat upon the white horse had a bow," and "a bow" signifies the doctrine of charity and faith, from which one fights against evils and falsities and disperses them. It is also evident from what follows, in which it is said, "and He went forth conquering and that He might conquer," by which is signified victory over evils and falsities; therefore "crown" here signifies eternal life, which is the reward of victory.</p><p>[2] "Crown" has a similar signification where temptations are treated of, because temptations are spiritual combats, as in the second chapter of this book, where these words occur:<p>Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have affliction ten days; be thou faithful even till death, and I will give thee the crown of life (<a href="../ae/126.htm">126</a>. Wisdom and eternal happiness taken together are eternal life, for the very life of heaven is in wisdom and eternal happiness. The "crown" of the martyrs has a like signification because they were in affliction, and were "faithful even till death," and were also in temptations and conquered; moreover, after death crowns were given them; but lest they should on that account appropriate honor to themselves, and thus acquire haughtiness, they cast them off from their heads.</p><p>[3] Because in the Word "wars" signify wars in a spiritual sense which are combats against evils and falsities, and "kings" signify truths from good which fight against evils and falsities, in ancient times, when men had a knowledge of correspondences and representations, kings in their battles wore a crown upon the head, and a bracelet upon the arm, as can be seen in the second book of Samuel:<p>The young man, the son of an Amalekite, who told David that Saul and Jonathan were dead, said, I came upon Mount Gilboa, when behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and the chariots and leaders followed hard after him. And he said to me, Come and put me to death. And I stood against him, and put him to death, and I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I bring them to thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3105.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3105</a>.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 358 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>358. "Et data est (ei) corona." - Quod significet vitam aeternam quae victoriae praemium, constat ex significatione "coronae", cum agitur de pugna spirituali, ut hic, quod sit vita aeterna quae victoriae praemium. Quod hic agatur de pugna spirituali, constat ex antecedentibus et sequentibus; in antecedentibus dicitur quod "Sedens super equo albo haberet arcum", et per "arcum" significatur doctrina charitatis et fidei, ex qua pugnatur contra mala et falsa, et dissipantur illa; et quoque ex sequentibus, in quibus dicitur, "Et exivit vincens et ut vinceret", per quae significatur victoria super illa; inde per "coronam" hic significatur vita aeterna quae victoriae praemium.<p>[2] Simile significatur per "coronam" ubi agitur de tentationibus, quoniam tentationes sunt pugnae spirituales, ut in capite secundo hujus Libri, ubi haec:<p>"Ecce futurum ut conjiciat ex vobis diabolus in custodiam ut tentemini, et habebitis afflictionem diebus decem; esto fidelis usque ad mortem, et dabo tibi coronam vitae" (vers. 10):<p>quod ibi per "coronam" significetur sapientia et felicitas aeterna, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_358/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_126" target=_top>126</a>): sapientia et felicitas aeterna simul sumptae sunt vita aeterna, nam in sapientia et in felicitate aeterna est ipsa vita caeli. Simile significatur per "coronam" martyrum, quoniam illi in afflictione fuerunt et fideles usque ad mortem, et quoque in tentationibus et vicerunt; etiam illis post mortem datae sunt coronae, sed ne honorem sibi inde arrogarent, et sic attraherent fastum, rejecerunt illas e capite suo.<p>[3] Quia per "bella" in Verbo significantur bella in spirituali sensu, quae sunt pugnae contra mala et falsa, et per "reges" significantur vera ex bono quae contra illa pugnant, inde antiquis temporibus, quando in scientia correspondentiarum et repraesentationum fuerunt, reges in proeliis habebant coronam super capite et armillam super brachio; ut constare potest ex Libro Secundo Samuelis,<p>Puer filius Amalekitae, qui nuntiavit Davidi quod mortuus esset Saul et Jonathan, dixit, "Veni in montem Gilboae, cum ecce Saul niteretur in hastam suam, ac currus et duces persequerentur illum;... et dixit ad me, Veni et occide me;... et steti contra eum et occidi illum;... et accepi coronam quae super capite ejus, et armillam quae super brachio, et adduco ea" ad te (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_358/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_1_6" target=_top>1:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_358/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_1_8-10" target=_top>8-10</a>).<p>Corona in proeliis tunc fuit insigne pugnae, et armilla super brachio fuit insigne potentiae, utriusque contra mala et falsa; hae etiam pugnae per "proelia" ubivis in Verbo, etiam Historico, significantur. <p>(Quod "armilla super brachio" significet potentiam veri ex bono, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_358/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3105" target=_top>3105</a>. Quid porro "coronae regum", et "coronae" in genere, significant, videatur (supra, ) n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_358/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_272" target=_top>272</a>.) </p>
