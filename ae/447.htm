<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 447</h4><p>447. Of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand.- That this signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven is evident from the representation and thence the signification of Zebulun and the tribe named after him, as denoting the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven. For the name Zebulun in Hebrew is derived from [a word meaning] cohabitation, and cohabitation in the spiritual sense signifies conjunction, such as exists with those who love each other. Zebulun here signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven, because the nine preceding tribes signify all those who are in the heavens and come into the heavens; and there are three heavens, the inmost, the middle, and the ultimate, and none come into heaven but those whom the Lord conjoins to Himself, therefore the three tribes last named signify conjunction with the Lord. The tribe of Zebulun signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven; the tribe of Joseph, the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the second heaven; and the tribe of Benjamin, the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the ultimate heaven.</p><p>[2] In the highest sense, Zebulun signifies the union of the Divine itself and the Divine Human in the Lord; in the internal sense, the conjunction of the Lord with heaven and the church, and specifically, the conjunction of good and truth therein, since this conjunction is the cause of the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the three heavens, and in the church. For the Lord flows into them with the good of love and charity, and conjoins it to the truths which they have, and by means of it He conjoins men and angels to Himself. These are the things signified by "cohabitation," from which Zebulun is named. That these things are signified by Zebulun may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_19.htm">Genesis 30:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_20.htm">20</a>).</p><p>[3] From these significations of Zebulun, it is evident what is signified by him in the following passages; as in the prophecy of Israel concerning his sons:<p>"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the seas; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be over unto Zidon" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6382.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6382-6386</a>).</p><p>[4] Similarly in the prophecy of Moses concerning the sons of Israel:<p>"Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going forth; and Issachar, in thy tents. They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall sacrifice sacrifices of justice; for they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the sand" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_19.htm">19</a>).<p>That Zebulun here also signifies the conjunction of good and truth, may be seen in a previous article (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_14.htm">5:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_20.htm">20</a>).<p>The subject in this prophecy is the combat of truth from good against falsity from evil. The king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor, and Sisera, the chief of his army, who fought against Barak and Deborah, signify the falsity of evil; Barak and Deborah, the truth of good. And because the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun signified combat from the truth which is from good, the tribe of Naphtali, combat, and the tribe of Zebulun, the conjunction of good and truth, therefore these two tribes only and not the other tribes were chosen to go into the combat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_4_6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>). That this combat signified such things, is evident from the prophecy pronounced by Deborah and Barak, which treats in the spiritual sense of the victory of truth from good over falsity from evil, and of the purification and reformation of the church. Here therefore, Out of Machir shall come down legislators, signifies, that the truths of good shall flow from the good of life, for Machir has a signification similar to that of Manasseh, for he was the son of Manasseh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_50_23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_31.htm">Josh. 13:31</a>); and legislators signify those who are in the truths of good, and in the abstract, the truths of good itself. And out of Zebulun they who handle the staff of the scribe, signifies intelligence from the conjunction of truth and good, for Zebulun signifies here, as above, the conjunction of truth and good, and the staff of the scribe, intelligence. Zebulun a people that devoted the soul to die, and Naphtali upon the high places of the field, signifies combat in the natural man by means of truths from the spiritual man, and from its influx and conjunction; the high places of the field signify the interior things of the spiritual man, from which the natural man fights. The kings came, they fought, then fought the kings of Canaan, signifies the falsities of evil against which there is combat. In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, signifies those falsities and their nature. They took no gain of silver, signifies that they took and carried away nothing of truth from good, silver denoting truth from good. They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sisera, signifies combat by means of the knowledges of truth and good, which come through heaven from the Lord, stars denoting such knowledges, and courses denoting truths.</p><p>[5] Zebulun and Naphtali also signify the conjunction of truth and good by combat against falsities and evils, and consequent reformation, in these words in Matthew:<p>Jesus "leaving Nazareth, came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; the people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_13.htm">4:13-17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">2</a>).<p>That these words in Isaiah were spoken concerning the Lord, is evident, for it is said, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet "wherefore the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, also Galilee of the Gentiles," signify the establishment of the church with the Gentiles, who are in the good of life and receive truths, and are thus in the conjunction thereof, and in combat against evil and falsities. That the establishment of the church and the reformation of such Gentiles are there meant, is also evident from the statement that it was "beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles," and also that the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and that to them that sat in the region and shadow of death light sprang up.</p><p>[6] Zebulun and Naphtali, in the highest sense, signify the union of the Divine itself with the Divine Human of the Lord by means of temptations admitted into Himself, and the victories which He obtained by His own power; as in David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_27.htm">Psalm 68:27-29</a>) explained above (no. 439:5). Because such things were signified by Zebulun, therefore, the tribe of Judah, together with the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun, encamped to the east about the tent of the congregation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_2_3.htm">Num. 2:3-10</a>). For the encampments of the sons of Israel around the tent of the congregation represented and thence signified the arrangement of the angelic societies in heaven; and those who are in conjunction with the Lord through love to Him are there in the east. The tribe of Judah represented love to the Lord, and the tribe of Zebulun, conjunction with Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 447</h4><p>447. Verse 8. Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand sealed, signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven. This is evident from the representation and consequent signification of "Zebulun" and the tribe named from him, as meaning the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven; because "Zebulun" in the Hebrew means cohabitation, and cohabitation signifies in the spiritual sense conjunction, such as exists with those who love each other. Here "Zebulun" signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven, because the nine preceding tribes signify all those who are in the heavens and who come into the heavens; and there are three heavens, the inmost, the middle, and the lowest, and no one comes into heaven except those whom the Lord conjoins to Himself; therefore the three tribes last mentioned signify conjunction with the Lord, "the tribe of Zebulun" the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven, "the tribe of Joseph" the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the second heaven, and "the tribe of Benjamin" the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the lowest heaven.</p><p>[2] "Zebulun" signifies in the highest sense the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the Lord, in the internal sense the Lord's conjunction with heaven and the church; and in particular, the conjunction of good and truth therein, for by this conjunction the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the three heavens and in the church is effected; for with such the Lord flows in with the good of love and charity, and conjoins that good to the truths that are with them, and thereby conjoins man and angel to Himself. This is what is signified by "cohabitation," which is the meaning of "Zebulun." That this is the meaning of "Zebulun" can be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_19.htm">Genesis 30:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_30_20.htm">20</a>).</p><p>[3] From this signification of "Zebulun" what is signified by him in the following passages can be seen. As in the prophecy of Israel respecting his sons:<p>Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the seas; and he shall dwell at a haven of ships; and his side shall be unto Zidon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6382.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6382-6386</a>.)</p><p>[4] The like is meant in the prophecy of Moses respecting the sons of Israel:<p>Of Zebulun he said, Be glad, Zebulun; in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; there they shall sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck the abundance of the seas, and the hidden things of the secret things of the sand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_19.htm">19</a>).<p>Here, too, "Zebulun" signifies the marriage of good and truth, as may be seen in the preceding article n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_18.htm">18-20</a>).<p>This prophecy treats of the combat of truth from good against falsity from evil; "the king of Canaan" who reigned in Hazor, and "Sisera" the captain of his army who fought against Barak and Deborah, signify the falsity of evil, and "Barak and Deborah" the truth of good; and as "the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun" signify combat from truth that is from good, "the tribe of Naphtali" combat, and "the tribe of Zebulun" the conjunction of good and truth, therefore these two tribes only, and not the other tribes, were taken to fight (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_4_6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>). That this was what this combat signified can be seen from the prophecy uttered by Barak and Deborah, which treats in the spiritual sense of the victory of truth from good over falsity from evil, and of the purification and reformation of the church. So here "Out of Machir shall come down lawgivers" signifies that the truths of good shall flow forth from the good of life, for "Machir" has a like signification as "Manasseh," because Machir was the son of Manasseh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_50_23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_13_31.htm">Joshua 13:31</a>); and "lawgivers" signify those who are in the truths of good, and in an abstract sense the truths of good; "and out of Zebulun they that draw the staff of the scribe" signifies intelligence from the conjunction of truth and good, "Zebulun" signifying here, as above, the conjunction of truth and good, and the "staff of the scribe" intelligence. "Zebulun was a people that devoted the soul to death, and Naphtali upon the heights of the field," signifies combat in the natural man by means of truths from the spiritual man and from its influx and conjunction, "the heights of the field" signifying the interior things that are of the spiritual man, from which the natural man combats; "the kings came, they fought, then fought the kings of Canaan" signifies the falsities of evil against which is combat; "in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo" signifies those falsities and of what quality they are; "they took no gain of silver" signifies that they took and carried away nothing of truth from good, "silver" meaning truth from good; "they fought from heaven, the stars from their courses fought with Sisera" signifies combat by means of the knowledges of truth and good, which are from the Lord through heaven, "stars" meaning such knowledges, and "courses" truths.</p><p>[5] Again, "Zebulun and Naphtali" signify the conjunction of truth and good through combat against falsities and evils, and consequent reformation. In Matthew:<p>Jesus leaving Nazareth, came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations; the people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death to them did light spring up. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens hath come nigh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_13.htm">Matthew 4:13-17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">2</a>).<p>In Isaiah this was evidently said respecting the Lord, for it is said "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet;" therefore "the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and Galilee of the nations," signify the establishment of the church with the Gentiles that are in the good of life and that receive truths and are thus in the conjunction of good and truth, and in combat against evils and falsities. That this means the establishment of the church and the reformation of such nations is evident also from its being said "beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations," and also "the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death did light spring up."</p><p>[6] "Zebulun and Naphtali" signify in the highest sense the union of the Divine Itself and the Lord's Divine Human by means of temptations admitted into Himself, and victories gained by His own power; as in David, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_27.htm">Psalms 68:27-29</a> (which may be seen explained above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_2_3.htm">Numbers 2:3-10</a>);<p>for the encampments of the sons of Israel about the tent of meeting represent and thence signify the arrangements of the angelic societies in heaven; and to the east in heaven are those who are in conjunction with the Lord through love to Him; for "the tribe of Judah" represented love to the Lord, and "the tribe of Zebulun" conjunction with Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 447 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>447. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_7_8" target=_top>8</a>.] "Ex tribu Sebulonis duodecim millia signati." - Quod significet conjunctionem illorum qui in tertio caelo cum Domino, constat ex repraesentatione et inde significatione "Sebulonis" et tribus ab illo nominatae, quod sit conjunctio illorum qui in tertio caelo cum Domino; Sebulon enim in lingua Hebraea dictus est a cohabitatione, et "cohabitatio" in sensu spirituali significat conjunctionem, qualis est illorum qui se amant: quod hic "Sebulon" significet conjunctionem illorum qui in tertio caelo cum Domino, est quia per novem tribus praecedentes significantur omnes illi qui in caelis sunt et in caelos veniunt: ac caeli sunt tres, intimum, medium et ultimum, ac nemo in caelum venit nisi quem Dominus Sibi conjungit; quare per has tres tribus ultimo memoratas significatur conjunctio cum Domino, per "tribum Sebulonis" conjunctio illorum qui in tertio caelo cum Domino, per "tribum Josephi" conjunctio illorum qui in secundo caelo cum Domino, et per "tribum Benjaminis" conjunctio illorum qui in ultimo caelo cum Domino.<p>[2] "Sebulon" in supremo sensu significat unionem ipsius Divini ac Divini Humani in Domino; in sensu interno, conjunctionem Domini cum caelo et cum ecclesia, et in specie conjunctionem boni et veri ibi, nam haec conjunctio facit conjunctionem illorum qui in tribus caelis sunt et in ecclesia cum Domino; Dominus enim influit apud illos cum bono amoris et charitatis, et conjungit id veris quae apud illos, et per id conjungit Sibi angelum et hominem: haec sunt quae per "cohabitationem", ex qua Sebulon dictus est, significantur. Quod haec per "Sebulonem" significentur, videri potest in Arcanis Caelestibus (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3960" target=_top>3960</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3961" target=_top>3961</a>), ubi explicata sunt Leae matris ejus verba cum illum peperit, quae haec sunt,<p>"Et concepit Leah, et peperit filium sextum Jacobo; et dixit Leah, Dotavit me Deus dote bona; vice hac cohabitabit mihi vir meus, quia peperi illi sex filios; et vocavit nomen ejus Sebulon" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_30_19" target=_top>Genesis 30:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_30_20" target=_top>20</a>).<p>[3] Ex his significationibus "Sebulonis" constare potest quid per illum significatur in sequentibus locis:<p>Ut in prophetia Israelis de filiis suis,<p>"Sebulon ad portum marium habitabit, et is ad portum navium, et latus ejus super ad Sidonem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_13" target=_top>Genesis 49:13</a>):<p>per "Sebulonem " ibi significatur conjunctio boni et veri, quae etiam conjugium caeleste vocatur; "habitare ad portum marium" significat conjunctionem spiritualium cum veritatibus naturalibus ("maria" sunt scientifica quae sunt veritates naturales): "habitare ad portum navium" significat conjunctionem spiritualem cum doctrinalibus ex Verbo ("naves" sunt doctrinalia et cognitiones omnium generum); "latus super ad Zidonem" significat extensionem ad cognitiones boni et veri ex caelesti regno. (Sed haec amplius explicata videantur in Arcanis Caelestibus n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6382" target=_top>6382-6386</a>.)<p>[4] Similiter in prophetia Mosis de filiis Israelis,<p>"Sebuloni dixit, Laetare Sebulon in exitu tuo, et Isaschar in tentoriis tuis: populos in montem vocabunt, ibi sacrificabunt sacrificia justitiae, quia affluentiam maris sugent, et obtecta occultorum arenae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_18" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_19" target=_top>19</a>);<p>quod "Sebulon" etiam hic conjugium boni et veri significet, videatur in superiori articulo (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_447/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_445" target=_top>445</a>), ubi haec prophetia explicata est.
