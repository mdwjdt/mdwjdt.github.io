<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 567</h4><p>567. And I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God.- That this signifies revelation from the Lord out of the spiritual heaven, is evident from the signification of hearing a voice, as denoting revelation, because what was revealed by that voice follows; and from the signification of the golden altar which is before God, as denoting the spiritual Divine of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of the four horns of the altar, as denoting the spiritual Divine in its ultimates. For the horns were in the ultimates of both altars, as well the altar of burnt-offering, as the altar of incense which is the golden altar; and because the horns were the ultimates of those altars, therefore they signified the Divine as to power, for all power is in ultimates, and for this reason the horns of the altars signified the Divine as to omnipotence; concerning the signification of these, see above (n. <a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>). That the altar of burnt-offering signified the celestial Divine, which is the Divine Good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391:1-21</a>, <a href="../ae/490.htm">490</a>, <a href="../ae/496.htm">496</a>). But that the altar of incense, or the golden altar, represented and thence signified the spiritual Divine, which is the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord, is evident from its description to be dealt with below.</p><p>[2] It shall be first explained here why the voice was heard from the four horns of the altar. The horns, which projected and stood out from the altars above mentioned, signified every thing belonging to them as to power, as is evident from what has been said and shown above (n. <a href="../ae/346.htm">346</a>, <a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>), and also from what has been said and shown concerning ultimates in the Arcana Coelestia, as, that interiors flow in successively into externals, even into the extremes or ultimates, and that there also they exist and subsist (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/624.htm">624</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6239.htm">6239</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6465.htm">6465</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9215.htm">9215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9216.htm">9216</a>); that they not only flow in successively, but also form in the ultimate what is simultaneous (in what order, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6451.htm">6451</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8603.htm">8603</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10099.htm">10099</a>); that therefore strength and power are in ultimates (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9836.htm">9836</a>); that therefore responses and revelations were given in ultimates (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10548.htm">10548</a>). Since responses and revelations were given in ultimates, it is evident that the reason, why the voice was heard from the four horns of the golden altar, is that the golden altar signifies the spiritual Divine, which is the Divine Truth that reveals, and that the horns signify the ultimates thereof, by means of which revelation is made. The golden altar, upon which they offered incense, signifies the spiritual Divine, which is Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord, because the offerings of incense which were offered upon that altar, signified worship from spiritual good, and the hearing and reception thereof by the Lord; see above (n. <a href="../ae/324.htm">324</a>, <a href="../ae/491.htm">491</a>, <a href="../ae/492.htm">492</a>, <a href="../ae/494.htm">494</a>).</p><p>[3] That the altar of incense signified the spiritual Divine, and that the offerings of incense upon it signified worship from spiritual good, and the favourable hearing and reception of it by the Lord, is evident from the construction of that altar, the details of which represented and signified those things. The construction of the altar of incense is thus described in Moses:<p>"Thou shalt make an altar of the offering of incense; of Shittim wood, shalt thou make it. A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof; the horns thereof shall be out of it. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the walls thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a border of gold round about. And two golden rings shalt thou make to it, under the border of it, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. And thou shalt make the staves of Shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put it before the veil that is over the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of spices in the morning; in the morning, when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps between the evenings, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations. Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-sacrifice, nor meal-offering; neither shall ye pour drink-offering thereon. And Aaron shall make an expiation upon the horns of it once in a year of the blood of the expiations of sin; once in the year shall he make expiation upon it throughout your generations; this is the holy of holies unto Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10176.htm">10176-10213</a>), where they are explained in their series. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 567</h4><p>567. And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, signifies revelation from the Lord out of the spiritual heaven. This is evident from the signification of "to hear a voice," as being revelation, because what was revealed by this voice follows; also from the signification of "the golden altar which is before God," as being the Divine spiritual (of which presently); also from the signification of "its four horns," as being the Divine spiritual in its ultimates; for the horns were in the ultimates of both altars, both the altar of burnt-offering and the altar of incense which is the golden altar; and as the horns were the ultimates of these altars they signified the Divine in respect to power, for all power is in ultimates; from this it is that "the horns of the altars" signified the Divine in relation to omnipotence (respecting which signification see above, n. <a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>. That "the altar of burnt-offering" signifies the Divine celestial, which is Divine good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/496.htm">496</a>); while the "altar of incense" (or the golden altar) represented and thence signified the Divine spiritual, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, as is evident from its description, which will be found below.</p><p>[2] It shall first be told here why the voice was heard "from the four horns of the altar." The "horns" that projected and stood out at the ultimate parts of the above-named altars signified all things belonging to them in respect to power, as can be seen from what has been shown above (n. <a href="../ae/346.htm">346</a>, <a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>), and also from what has been said and shown respecting ultimates in the Arcana Coelestia, as that interiors flow in successively into externals, even into things extreme or ultimate, and that there they exist and subsist (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/634.htm">634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6239.htm">6239</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6465.htm">6465</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9215.htm">9215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9216.htm">9216</a>); that they not only flow in successively, but also form in the ultimate what is simultaneous, in what order (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6451.htm">6451</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8603.htm">8603</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10099.htm">10099</a>); that thus strength and power are in ultimates (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9836.htm">9836</a>); and that thence responses and revelations were given in ultimates (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10548.htm">10548</a>). Since responses and revelations were made from ultimates, it is evident why "the voice was heard from the four horns of the golden altar," namely, because the "golden altar" signifies the Divine spiritual, which is Divine truth which reveals, and because the "horns" signify its ultimates, through which revelation is made. The "golden altar" upon which incense was offered signifies the Divine spiritual, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, because the "incense" that was offered upon the altar signified worship from spiritual good, and the hearing and acceptance of it by the Lord (See above, n. <a href="../ae/324.htm">324</a>, <a href="../ae/491.htm">491</a>, <a href="../ae/492.htm">492</a>, <a href="../ae/494.htm">494</a>).</p><p>[3] That "the altar of incense" signified the Divine spiritual, and that "offering incense" upon it signified worship from spiritual good, and the grateful hearing and acceptance of such worship by the Lord, is evident from the construction of that altar, every particular in which represented and signified these things. Its construction is thus described in Moses:<p>Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon; of shittim wood shalt thou make it. A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height of it; its horns shall be from it. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its roof, and its walls round about, and its horns; and thou shall make for it a rim of gold round about. And two rings shalt thou make for it from under its rim, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for the staves with which to bear it. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put it before the veil that is over the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of spices in the morning; in the morning, when dressing the lamps he shall burn it; and when Aaron maketh the lamps to ascend between the evenings he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah in your generations. Ye shall make no strange incense to ascend upon it, nor burnt-sacrifice, nor meal-offering; nor shall ye pour drink-offering upon it. And Aaron shall make expiation upon the horns of it once in the year of the blood of the expiations of sin; once in the year shall he make expiation upon it in your generations: this is the holy of holies unto Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10176.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10176</a>), where they are explained in series. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 567 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>567. "Et audivi vocem unam ex quatuor cornibus altaris aurei quod coram Deo." - Quod significet revelationem a Domino e caelo spirituali, constat ex significatione "audire vocem", quod sit revelatio, quia sequitur quid per illam vocem revelatum est; ex significatione "altaris aurei quod coram Deo", quod sit Divinum spirituale (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "quatuor cornuum ejus", quod sit Divinum spirituale in suis ultimis: nam cornua erant in ultimis utriusque altaris, tam altaris holocausti quam altaris suffimenti quod est altare aureum; et quia cornua erant ultima altarium illorum, ideo significabant Divinum quoad potentiam, nam in ultimis est omnis potentia; inde est quod "cornua altarium" significaverint Divinum quoad omnipotentiam (de qua illorum significatione videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_316" target=_top>316</a> [d]). <p>Quod "altare holocausti" significaverit Divinum caeleste, quod est Divinum Bonum, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a> [a-f] , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_490" target=_top>490</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_496" target=_top>496</a>); quod autem "altare suffimenti" seu "altare aureum" repraesentaverit et inde significaverit Divinum spirituale, quod est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, constat ex descriptione ejus, de qua infra.<p>[2] Hic primum dicetur unde erat quod vox audita sit "e quatuor cornibus altaris." "Cornua", quae ex altaribus supra dictis ultimo prodibant et exstabant, significabant omnia illorum quoad potentiam, ut constare potest ex illis quae supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_346" target=_top>346</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_417" target=_top>417</a> [a]) ostensa sunt, et quoque ex illis quae de ultimis dicta et ostensa sunt in Arcanis Caelestibus; ut quod interiora successive influant in externa, usque in extrema seu ultima, et quod ibi etiam existant et subsistant (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_634" target=_top>634</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6239" target=_top>6239</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6465" target=_top>6465</a>, <sup>1</sup></p><p>,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9215" target=_top>9215</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9216" target=_top>9216</a>) quod non modo successive influant, sed etiam forment in ultimo simultaneum (quo ordine, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5897" target=_top>5897</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6451" target=_top>6451</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8603" target=_top>8603</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10099" target=_top>10099</a>): quod inde in ultimis sit robur et potentia (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9836" target=_top>9836</a>): et quod inde in ultimis responsa et revelata (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9905" target=_top>9905</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10548" target=_top>10548</a>). Quoniam ex ultimis fiunt responsa et revelata, patet causa cur "audita est vox ex quatuor cornibus altaris aurei", nempe quia "altare aureum" significat Divinum spirituale, quod est Divinum Verum quod revelat, et quia "cornua" significant ultima ejus, per quae revelatio. <p>Quod "altare aureum", super quo fiebant suffitus, significet Divinum spirituale, quod est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, est quia "suffitus", qui super illo altari fiebant, significabant cultum ex bono spirituali, ac auditionem et receptionem ejus a Domino (de qua re videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324" target=_top>324</a> [h] , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_491" target=_top>491</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_492" target=_top>492</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_494" target=_top>494</a>).<p>[3] Quod "altare suffimenti" significaverit Divinum spirituale, et quod "suffitiones" super illo significaverint cultum ex bono Spirituali, ac auditionem et receptionem gratam ejus a Domino, constare potest a constructione illius altaris, in qua singula repraesentabant et significabant illa. Describitur constructio ejus ita apud Mosen,<p>"Facies altare suffitionis suffimenti; ex lignis schittim facies illud; cubitus longitudo ejus, et cubitus latitudo ejus; quadratum erit, et duo cubiti altitudo ejus; ex illo cornua ejus. Et obduces illud auro puro, tectum ejus, parietes ejus circumcirca, et cornua ejus, et facies ei limbum auri circumcirca: et duos annulos facies ei desub limbo ejus, super duabus costis ejus, facies super duobus lateribus ejus, et erit ad receptacula vectibus, ad portandum illud in illis. Et facies vectes ex lignis schittim, et obduces illos auro. Et dabis illud ante velum, quod super arca testimonii, ante propitiatorium quod super testimonio, quo conveniam te ibi. Et suffiet super illo Aharon suffimentum aromatum in mane, in mane; in adornando lucernas suffiet illud; et in ascendere faciendo Aharon lucernas inter vesperas suffiet illud; suffimentum juge coram Jehovah in generationes vestras. Non ascendere facietis super illo suffimentum alienum, et holocaustum et mincham, et libamen non libabitis super eo.
