<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 117</h4><p>117. And tribulation. That this signifies anxiety from the desire to know truths, is evident from the signification of tribulation, as being such anxiety; for those are here treated of who wish to understand the Word, and do not yet well understand it (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/112.htm">112</a>), and these are in a state of anxiety as to the spirit when they do not understand. That they have such anxiety when they do not understand, none can know but those who are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, thus, who are in spiritual affection. Who these are, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/115.htm">115</a>). The reason is, that they are conjoined to the angels of heaven, who continually desire truths, because they desire intelligence and wisdom. They desire these as the hungry desire food; therefore, also, intelligence and wisdom are called spiritual food. This desire man has from his infancy, because, when he is an infant, and afterwards when he becomes a boy, he is conjoined to heaven; and this desire is from heaven, but it perishes with those who turn themselves to the world. From these considerations it may be known what the anxiety of mind, or spiritual anxiety, is, which is here signified by tribulation.</p><p>[2] The reason why they have such anxiety when they read the Word and do not well understand it, is, that all the truths of heaven and the church are from the Word, and lie concealed in its spiritual sense, but are not opened to any except those who are conjoined with heaven, because that sense of the Word is in heaven. But the spiritual sense itself of the Word - does not flow into man directly from heaven, but it flows into his affection, and by this into the knowledges (cognitiones) which he has, and thus enkindles his desire, and then, so far as be can see from the literal sense of the Word, so far be receives the genuine truths of the church. Every one who is in the spiritual affection of truth perceives that there are few things which he knows, and infinitely numerous things which he does not know. He knows also that to know and acknowledge this, is the first step to wisdom; and that those have not arrived at the first step to wisdom who pride themselves on their knowledge (scientia), and thence believe themselves to be highly intelligent. Such persons also are in the habit of being more proud of falsities than of truths, for they have regard to their own fame, and are influenced by that alone, and not by the truth itself. Such are those who are only in a natural affection, and the desire thence derived (concerning whom also see above, n. <a href="../ae/115.htm">115</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 117</h4><p>117. And affliction, signifies anxiety from a longing to know truths. This is evident from the signification of "affliction," as being anxiety of mind from a longing to know truths; for those who wish to understand the Word, but who do not as yet well understand it, are here treated of (See above, n. <a href="../ae/112.htm">112</a>), and these are in anxiety as to the spirit when they do not understand. That these have such anxiety when they do not understand, none can know except those who are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, that is, who are in spiritual affection; who these are may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/115.htm">115</a>). The reason of this is, that such are conjoined to the angels of heaven, and angels continually long for truths, because they long for intelligence and wisdom; they long for these as a hungry man longs for food. For this reason also intelligence and wisdom are called spiritual food. This longing also man has from infancy, for when he is an infant, and afterwards when a child, he is conjoined to heaven, and this longing is from heaven; but with those who turn themselves to the world it perishes. From this it may be known what is the anxiety of mind or spiritual anxiety that is here signified by "affliction. "</p><p>[2] They have such anxiety when they read the Word and do not well understand it, because all the truths of heaven and the church are from the Word, and lie concealed therein in its spiritual sense, and are not opened to any except such as are conjoined to heaven, since that sense of the Word is in heaven. Yet the spiritual sense itself of the Word does not flow in with man out of heaven, but it flows into his affection, and through this into the knowledges that he has, and thus kindles his longing, and he then receives the genuine truths of the church so far as he can see them from the literal sense of the Word. Everyone who is in the spiritual affection of truth is conscious that the things that he knows are few, and the things that he does not know are infinite. He is aware, moreover, that knowing and acknowledging this is the first step towards wisdom; and that those who pride themselves on the things they know, and believe themselves on account of these to be most intelligent, have not reached this first step. Such persons also commonly glory more from falsities than from truths, for they have regard to their own reputation, and are affected by that alone, and not by truth itself. Such are they who are in natural affection only and in longing from that (See above, n. <a href="../ae/115.htm">115</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 117 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>117. "Et afflictionem." - Quod significet anxietatem ex desiderio cognoscendi vera, constat ex significatione "afflictionis", quod sit anxietas mentis ex desiderio cognoscendi vera; agitur enim de illis qui volunt intelligere Verbum, et nondum bene intelligunt (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_117/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_112" target=_top>112</a>); et hi in anxietate quoad spiritum sunt, quando non intelligunt. Quod illis talis anxietas sit quando non intelligunt, non scire possunt alii quam qui in affectione veri propter verum sunt, ita qui in affectione spirituali; quinam illi sunt, videatur mox supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_117/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_115" target=_top>115</a>). Causa est, quia illi conjuncti sunt angelis caeli; et hi continue desiderant vera, quia intelligentiam et sapientiam; desiderant illas sicut famelicus cibum, quapropter etiam intelligentia et sapientia vocatur "cibus spiritualis." Hoc etiam desiderium est homini ab infantia, quia homo cum infans est, et dein cum puer, conjunctus est caelo, et ex caelo hoc desiderium est; sed perit apud illos qui se vertunt ad mundum. Ex his sciri potest quid anxietas mentis seu anxietas spiritualis, quae significatur hic per "afflictionem."<p>[2] Quod talis anxietas illis sit cum legunt Verbum et non bene intelligunt illud, est quia omnia vera caeli et ecclesiae inde sunt, et ibi recondita latent in sensu ejus spirituali, at non aperiuntur aliis quam qui conjuncti sunt caelo, quoniam ille sensus Verbi in caelo est; sed e caelo non influit ipse spiritualis sensus Verbi apud hominem, verum influit in affectionem ejus, et per hanc in cognitiones quae apud illum, et sic desiderium ejus incendit; et tunc quantum ex sensu litterali Verbi videre potest, tantum recipit genuina vera ecclesiae. Quisque qui in affectione veri spirituali est, appercipit quod pauca sint quae scit, et infinita quae non scit; novit etiam quod illud scire et agnoscere sit primus gradus ad sapientiam; et quod ad primum gradum non venerint qui ex scientiis superbiunt, ac intelligentissimos se inde credunt: hi etiam solent ex falsis plus quam ex veris gloriari; spectant enim sui famam, et hac solum afficiuntur, et non ipso vero; tales sunt qui solum in naturali affectione et inde desiderio sunt (de qua etiam videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_117/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_115" target=_top>115</a>). </p>
