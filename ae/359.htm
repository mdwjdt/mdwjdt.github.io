<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 359</h4><p>359. And he went forth conquering, and to conquer. That this signifies the removal of evils and thence of falsities at the end of life, and afterwards to eternity, is manifest from the signification of conquering in the Word, as denoting to conquer spiritually, which is, to subjugate evils and falsities; but because these are conquered only as they are removed by the Lord, hence by conquering is signified the removal of evils and falsities. (That evils and falsities are removed and not obliterated, or that man is withheld from them, and kept in good and truth by the Lord, may be seen in the <a href="../njhd/166.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 166</a>; and in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/865.htm">Arcana Coelestia 865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/868.htm">868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/887.htm">887</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/894.htm">894</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/929.htm">929</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1581.htm">1581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2116.htm">2116</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2406.htm">2406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4564.htm">4564</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8206.htm">8206</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8393.htm">8393</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8988.htm">8988</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9014.htm">9014</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9333.htm">9333-9338</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9446.htm">9446-9448</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9451.htm">9451</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10057.htm">10057</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10060.htm">10060</a>.) It is said, He went forth conquering, and to conquer, and by, He went forth conquering, is signified the removal of evils and of the falsities thence to the end of life; and by to conquer, is signified, and afterwards to eternity; for he who combats against evils and falsities, and conquers them in the world even to the end of life, conquers them to eternity; for according to the character of a man at the end of his life in consequence of his past life, such he remains to eternity. The reason why to conquer signifies to conquer spiritually is, because the Word in its inmost is spiritual, or in its inmost treats of spiritual things, and not of earthly things; the earthly things which are in the sense of the letter, serve only its spiritual sense for a basis, in which spiritual things terminate and in which they are. The same is signified by conquering in the following passages:</p><p>[2] In the Revelation:<p>"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_7.htm">2:7</a>). "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_11.htm">2:11</a>). "He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_26.htm">2:26</a>). "I will make him that overcometh a pillar in the temple of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_12.htm">3:12</a>). "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_21.htm">3:21</a>). "They overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of the testimony" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_11.htm">12:11</a>). "He that overcometh shall be master of all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_7.htm">21:7</a>).<p>And in John:<p>Jesus [said] to the disciples, These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but trust confidently, I have overcome the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_33.htm">16:33</a>).<p>By the Lord's overcoming the world, is meant that He subjugated all the hells; for the world here signifies all evils and falsities, which are from hell (as also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_31.htm">12:31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_17.htm">14:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_30.htm">30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_18.htm">15:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_19.htm">19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_8.htm">16:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_9.htm">17:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_16.htm">16</a>).</p><p>[3] The same is signified by conquering, where it is said of the Lord, in Isaiah:<p>"Who is this that cometh from Edom, sprinkled as to his garments from Bozrah? I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the people not a man was with me; therefore have I trodden them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath; whence their victory is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have polluted all my raiment. But I have made their victory to descend into the earth" (<a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>). The Word in the sense of the letter is here also meant by garments, because therein are truths investing, for the sense of the letter serves for a garment to the spiritual sense; and because the Word, as to that sense, was torn asunder by the Jewish people, and thereby the Divine truth adulterated, it is said, "sprinkled as to his garments from Bozrah, their victory is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have polluted all my raiment." The garments from Bozrah signify the ultimate of the Word, which is the sense of its letter; their victory upon my garments, signifies the wrong interpretation and application of the truth by those who wrest the sense of the letter to favour their own loves, and the principles thence conceived, as was done by the Jews, and is also done at this day by many. This is meant by their victory upon my garments. That the Lord alone fought, is signified by, I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the people there was not a man with me. The wine-press signifies combat from Divine truths against falsities, because in the wine-presses the wine is pressed out from the grapes; and by wine is signified Divine truth; hence to tread it alone, and of the people not a man was with me, signifies, alone, without the aid of any one. That the Lord subjugated the hells, is signified by, I have trodden them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath. It is said, I have trodden and I have trampled, because of the wine-press, and they signify that he destroyed; it is said anger and wrath, because they were destroyed, and they are attributed in the sense of the letter to the Lord, when, notwithstanding, there is nothing of anger and wrath in Him, but in those who are against Him; from the appearance it is so said here and in many places elsewhere. That they were subjugated, and condemned to hell, is signified by, I have made their victory to descend into the earth, into the earth denoting into damnation, thus into hell. That by the earth is also signified damnation, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a> at the end). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 359</h4><p>359. And he went forth conquering and that He might conquer, signifies the removal of evils and of falsities thence to the end of life, and afterwards to eternity. This is evident from the signification of "to conquer" in the Word as being to conquer spiritually, which is to subjugate evils and falsities; but as these are not conquered otherwise than that they are taken away by the Lord, "to conquer" signifies the removal of evils and falsities. (That evils and falsities are removed, and not wiped out, or that man is withheld from them, and kept in good and truth by the Lord, see in <a href="../njhd/166.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 166</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/865.htm">Arcana Coelestia 865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/868.htm">868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/887.htm">887</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/894.htm">894</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/929.htm">929</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1581.htm">1581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2116.htm">2116</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2406.htm">2406</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4564.htm">4564</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8206.htm">8206</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8393.htm">8393</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8988.htm">8988</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9014.htm">9014</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9333.htm">9333-9338</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9446.htm">9446-9448</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9451.htm">9451</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10057.htm">10057</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10060.htm">10060</a>.) It is said "he went forth conquering and that He might conquer," and "He went forth conquering" signifies the removal of evils and of falsities thence to the end of life; "and that He might conquer" signifies their removal afterwards to eternity; for he who fights against evils and falsities and conquers them, in the world even to the end of life, conquers them to eternity; for such as man is at the end of his life in consequence of his past life, such he remains to eternity. "To conquer" signifies to conquer spiritually, because the Word is in its bosom spiritual, that is, in its bosom it treats of spiritual things, and not of earthly things; the earthly things that are in the sense of its letter merely serve its spiritual sense as a basis, into which spiritual things close and in which they are. "To conquer [or to overcome]" has a like signification in the following passages.</p><p>[2] In Revelation:<p>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>).<p>He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>).<p>He that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end, I will give him power over the nations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>).<p>He that overcometh I will make him a pillar in the temple of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>).<p>He that overcometh I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p>They overcame the dragon through the blood of the Lamb, and through the word of the testimony (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>).<p>He that overcometh shall possess all things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to Me a son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a>).<p>And in John:<p>Jesus [said] to the disciples, These things I have spoken unto you that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but confide, I have overcome the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p>The Lord's "overcoming the world" means that He subjugated all the hells; for "the world" here signifies all evils and falsities, which are from hell (as also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_31.htm">12:31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_17.htm">14:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_30.htm">30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_15.htm">15</a> :18, 19; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_8.htm">16:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_9.htm">17:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_16.htm">16</a>).</p><p>[3] "To conquer" has a like signification when predicated of the Lord in Isaiah:<p>Who is this that cometh from Edom, His garments sprinkled from Bozrah? I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people not a man was with Me; therefore have I trodden them in Mine anger, and trampled them in My wrath; wherefore their victory is sprinkled upon My garments, and I have stained all My raiment. But I have made their victory to descend to the earth (<a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>). The Word in the sense of the letter is also meant here by "garments," because it contains investing truths, for the sense of the letter serves as a garment to the spiritual sense. And as the Word, in respect to that sense, was torn asunder by the Jewish people, and Divine truth was thereby adulterated, it is said, "His garments sprinkled from Bozrah, their victory is sprinkled upon My garments, and I have stained all My raiment," "garments from Bozrah" signify the ultimate of the Word which is the sense of the letter, "their victory upon My garments" signifies the wrong interpretation and application of the truth by those who wrest the sense of the letter to favor their own loves, and the principles thence assumed, as was done by the Jews, and is done also at this day by many; this is meant by "their victory upon My garments."<p>That the Lord fought alone is signified by "I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people not a man was with Me," "wine-press" signifying combat from Divine truths against falsities, because in wine-presses the wine is pressed out from grapes, and "wine" signifies Divine truth; therefore "to tread it alone, and of the people not a man was with Me," signifies alone, with no aid from anyone. That the Lord subjugated the hells is signified by, "I have trodden them in Mine anger, and trampled them in My wrath;" it is said, "I have trodden" and "I have trampled," because of the reference to the wine-press, and because destruction is signified; it is said, "anger" and "wrath" because the hells are destroyed; and in the sense of the letter this is attributed to the Lord, when nevertheless nothing of anger or wrath pertains to Him, but only to those who are against Him; it is according to appearance that it is so said here and in very many places elsewhere. That such were subjugated and condemned to hell is signified by, "I have made their victory to descend to the earth," "to the earth" meaning into damnation, thus into hell. (That "earth" also signifies damnation, see above, n. <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 359 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>359. "Et exivit vincens et ut vinceret" - Quod significet remotionem malorum et inde falsorum in fine vitae, et postea in aeternum, constat ex significatione "vincere" in Verbo, quod sit spiritualiter vincere, quod est subjugare mala et falsa; sed haec quia non aliter vincuntur quam quod removeantur a Domino, inde per "vincere" significatur remotio malorum et falsorum.
