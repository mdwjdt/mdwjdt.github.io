<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 553</h4><p>553. And on their heads as it were crowns like gold.- That this signifies, that they appear to themselves, when they reason, to be wise and conquerors, is evident from the signification of head, which denotes wisdom and intelligence, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of a crown of gold, as denoting a reward of victory (see above, n. <a href="../ae/358.htm">358</a>). A crown like gold signifies the reward of victory, because kings, in ancient times, when in combats with their enemies, wore crowns of gold upon their heads, besides various other insignia which were then the mark of kings. The reason was, that kings represented the Lord as to Divine Truth, and Divine Truth fights from Divine Good; this therefore was represented by a crown of gold, while wisdom itself and intelligence were represented by the head upon which the crown was. Hence crowns were assigned to martyrs, for they fought from Divine Truth against falsities from evil, which are from hell, and came off conquerors, because they maintained the combat even unto death which they feared not. From these things it is evident, that by [the locusts] having upon their heads as it were crowns like gold, is signified, that those who are sensual men, from the persuasion of falsity in which they are, appear to themselves to be wise and conquerors.</p><p>[2] Since the locusts are described as to their heads, their faces, and their breasts, upon which were breast-plates, and as to their tails, their hair and teeth, it is important that the signification of their heads and the rest should be known.<p>The head, in the Word, signifies wisdom and intelligence, because these reside in it; but when those are treated of who are not in any wisdom and intelligence, because in falsities from evil, then the head signifies folly and insanity, because falsities and evils are therein and therefrom. In the present case, however, as those who are sensual and in the persuasion of falsity are treated of, the head properly signifies folly and insanity, for they see falsities as truths, and evils as goods, being perpetually in visions from fallacies. It is therefore said of them, that "on their heads as it were crowns like gold, and their faces as the faces of men," and many things that follow, all of which were appearances originating in their fantasy, wherefore, it is said, "as it were crowns," and "like gold." It is evident, from this that those appearances were not real, but fallacious appearances. For all the appearances which exist in the heavens are real, because they are correspondences. For the interior things pertaining to the affections and thence thoughts of the angels, when they pass to the sight of their eyes, are clothed in forms such as appear in the heavens, and because they are visible, they are called appearances, and are said to be correspondences, and they are real because from creation. But the case is otherwise in regard to the appearances in some of the hells, where are those who are in persuasions of falsity from evil; from these persuasions fantastic visions exist, in which there is inwardly nothing real, therefore they also vanish away upon the influx of only a single ray from the light of heaven. Of such a nature are the appearances here related concerning the locusts. But concerning appearances in the spiritual world, as well real as not real, see <a href="../hh/170.htm">Heaven and Hell 170-176</a>); as also above in the explanation (n. <a href="../ae/369.htm">369</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 553</h4><p>553. And upon their heads as it were crowns like gold, signifies that they seem to themselves, when they reason, as if they were wise and victorious. This is evident from the signification of "head" as being wisdom and intelligence (of which presently); and from the signification of "a crown of gold," as being a reward of victory (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/358.htm">358</a>. "A crown like gold," signifies the reward of victory, because kings in ancient times, when they were in combats with their enemies wore crowns of gold upon their heads, besides various insignia that then belonged to kings. This was because kings represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and Divine truth combats from Divine good; so this was represented by "a crown of gold," and wisdom and intelligence itself by the head upon which was the crown. This is why the martyrs had crowns, for they fought from Divine truth against the falsities from evil that are from hell, and came off victors, because they fought even unto death, which they did not fear. From this it can be seen that "upon their heads as it were crowns like gold" signifies that those who are sensual men seem to themselves, from the persuasion of the falsity in which they are, to be wise and victorious.</p><p>[2] As the locusts are described in respect to their heads, their faces, their breasts upon which were breast plates, and as to their tails, and hair, and teeth, it is important to know what their heads signify, and afterwards what the other things signify. The "head" signifies in the Word wisdom and intelligence, because these have their seat in the head; but when those who are in no wisdom or intelligence because they are in falsities from evil are treated of, the "head" signifies folly and insanity, because falsities and evils are therein and therefrom. So here, where those who are sensual and in the persuasion of falsity are treated of, the "head" properly signifies folly and insanity, for such see falsities as truths and evils as goods, for they constantly see what they see from fallacies. Of such, therefore, it is said that "upon their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces as men's faces," and other things follow, all of which were appearances from the fantasy with them, therefore it is said "as it were" crowns, and "like" gold, which shows that these appearances were not real but fallacious. For in the heavens all appearances that exist are real, because they are correspondences; for the interiors belonging to the affections and thoughts therefrom of the angels, when they pass to the sight of their eyes, are clothed in such forms as are manifest in the heavens; they are called appearances because they are visible, and they are said to be correspondences and are real because they spring from creation. But it is otherwise with the appearances in some of the hells, where those are who are in the persuasions of falsity from evil; from these persuasions fantastic visions spring, in which there is inwardly nothing real, and for this reason they also vanish if a single ray from the light of heaven flows in. Such are the appearances that are here described in reference to the "locusts." (But of appearances in the spiritual world, both those that are real and those that are not real, see in the work on <a href="../hh/170.htm">Heaven and Hell 170-176</a>; and above, in the explanation, n. <a href="../ae/369.htm">369</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 553 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>553. "Et super capitibus illarum sicut coronae similes auro." - Quod significet quod appareant sibi cum ratiocinantur sicut sapientes et victores, constat ex significatione "capitis", quod sit sapientia et intelligentia (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "coronae ex auro", quod sit victoriae praemium (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_553/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_358" target=_top>358</a>). <p>Quod "corona similis auro" significet victoriae praemium, est quia reges antiquis temporibus, quando in pugnis cum hostibus fuerunt, gerebant coronas ex auro super capitibus suis, praeter plura insignia quae tunc fuerunt regibus: causa erat quia reges repraesentabant Dominum quoad Divinum Verum, et Divinum Verum pugnat ex Divino Bono; hoc itaque repraesentabatur per coronam ex auro, et ipsa sapientia et intelligentia per caput super quo corona. Inde fuerunt coronae martyribus; hi enim, contra falsa ex malo quae ex inferno, ex Divino Vero pugnarunt, et victores evaserunt, quia usque ad mortem, quam nec timuerunt. Ex his constare potest quod per "super capitibus sicut coronae similes auro" significetur quod illi, qui sensuales homines sunt, ex persuasione falsi in qua sunt, appareant sibi Sicut sapientes et victores.<p>[2] Quoniam describuntur locustae quoad capita, quoad facies, quoad pectora super quae thoraces, et quoad caudas, et quoad capillos et dentes, interest scire quid per "capita" eorum significatur, et dein quid per reliqua. Per "caput" in Verbo significatur sapientia et intelligentia, quia resident in illo; at quando agitur de illis qui non in aliqua sapientia et intelligentia sunt, quia in falsis ex malo sunt, tunc per "caput" significatur stultitia et insania, ex causa quia falsa et mala sunt ibi et inde: hic autem, ubi agitur de illis qui sensuales sunt et in persuasione falsi, per "caput" proprie significatur stultitia et insania; nam illi vident falsa sicut Vera, ac mala sicut bona, sunt enim perpetuo in visionibus ex fallaciis: inde est quod de illis dicatur quod "super capitibus eorum essent sicut coronae similes auro, et facies sicut facies hominum", et plura quae sequuntur, quae omnia fuerunt apparentiae ex phantasia apud illos; quare dicitur "sicut" coronae, et "similes" auro; unde patet quod apparentiae illae non essent apparentiae reales sed fallaces. Apparentiae enim omnes quae in caelis existunt sunt reales, quia sunt correspondentiae; interiora enim quae sunt affectionum et inde cogitationum apud angelos, dum tranSeunt ad visum oculorum illorum, induuntur formis quales apparent in caelis; et quia visibiles sunt vocantur apparentiae, et dicuntur correspondentiae, et sunt reales quia ex creatione. Aliter autem apparentiae in quibusdam infernis, ubi sunt illi qui in persuasionibus falsi ex malo sunt; ex persuasionibus illis existunt visiones phantasticae, in quibus intus nihil reale est; quare etiam evanescunt, dum modo radius e luce caeli influit: tales apparentiae sunt quae de "locustis" hic memorantur. (Ast de apparentiis in mundo spirituali, tam realibus quam non realibus, videatur in opere De Caelo et Inferno, n. <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_553/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_170" target=_top>170-176</a>; ut et supra, in explicatione, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_553/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_369" target=_top>369</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_553/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_395" target=_top>395</a> [a] .)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
