<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 394</h4><p>394. Saying, How long, O Lord, who art holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood upon them that dwell on the earth? That this signifies sighings to the Lord, who is Justice, concerning judgment and the removal of those who persecute and infest them that profess the Lord, and live a life of charity, is plain from the signification of crying, and saying, How long, O Lord, as denoting to utter to the Lord sighs from grief, for these are expressions of those that groan and sigh, and supplicate for justice; from the signification of, "who art holy and true," as denoting Him who is justice; for justice, when said of the Lord, signifies that He does not tolerate such things, and this because He is holy and true; and from the signification of judging and avenging our blood, as denoting to judge and to remove those who persecute and infest them that profess the Lord, and live the life of charity. The reason why these things are signified by those words is, because by blood is signified all violence offered to Divine good and Divine truth, thus to the Lord consequently, violence offered to those who live the life of charity and faith. To offer violence to them is to offer violence to the Lord Himself, according to the words of the Lord Himself in Matthew:<p>"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="../ae/329.htm">329</a>); and from the signification of them that dwell on the earth, as denoting those who were in the former heaven, which afterwards passed away; for they dwelt upon the earth, upon mountains, hills, and rocks, in the spiritual world, and those who acknowledged the Lord and led the life of charity then abode under the earth, or under heaven, and were there hid and reserved (see above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/392.htm">392</a>).</p><p>[2] From these things it is evident what is meant by those words in their genuine sense. But no one can know that such things are meant but him to whom it is revealed. For who otherwise could know who are meant by the souls of the slain, and what is meant by avenging their blood on them who dwell upon the earth? He who does not know from revelation who they are, would imagine that the martyrs only are meant, when, nevertheless, they were not the martyrs, but all those who suffered persecution, and were infested by those who were in the former heaven which passed away; for the latter were such as to thrust out from themselves all who professed the Lord and were in the life of charity, because they were inwardly evil (as has been said above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/392.htm">392</a>). To which I shall add these statements: All those in the spiritual world, who are inwardly evil, however moral the life in externals they have led in the world, cannot at all bear any one who worships the Lord, and lives a life of charity; as soon as they see such persons, they infest and either injure them or treat them with contumely. I have frequently wondered that it should be so, and all must also do so who are unacquainted with it, because the same persons, in the world, tolerated preachings concerning the Lord, and also concerning charity, and also they themselves spoke doctrinally upon such things, but yet when they become spirits they cannot bear them. The reason, however, is, that this aversion is inherent in the evil in which they are; for in their evil there exists enmity, indeed, hatred against the Lord, and also against those who are led by the Lord, these being those who live the life of charity; but this enmity and hatred lie concealed in their spirit, therefore they are in them when they become spirits; then that antipathy or opposition inherent in evil, comes forth.</p><p>[3] Take, for example, those in whom the love of ruling has predominated. Their delight is to rule over others, and, if they can, over all; this delight remains with them after death, nor can it be removed, because every delight belongs to the love, and the predominating love constitutes the life of every one; and this life remains to eternity. When such persons become spirits, they continually seek dominion over others from the delight of their love, as in the world, and when they cannot obtain it, they are enraged against the Lord; and because they are unable to injure the Lord Himself, they exercise their rage against those who profess Him; for the delight of their love is opposed to the delight of celestial love, the latter delight being that the Lord may rule, whereas the former delight is that they themselves may rule, which is the reason why hatred against the Lord is implanted in this delight, and against all who are led by Him, these being those who lead the life of charity. From these things the reason may be seen why those who professed the Lord, and led a life of charity, were taken away by the Lord from the violence of such spirits, and concealed in the lower earth, and there reserved by the Lord until the judgment; and why after the judgment, those who dwelt above the earth, upon the mountains, hills, and rocks, who were as said above inwardly evil, were cast out, and those who had been hid under the earth, or under heaven, were elevated, and allotted an inheritance in the places whence the former were ejected. From these things it may now be more fully comprehended what is meant by these words which follow in the verse, that it was told them that they should rest for a little time, until they should be fulfilled. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 394</h4><p>394. Saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood upon them that dwell on the earth? signifies sighings to the Lord, who is justice, respecting the judgment and removal of those who persecute and infest those who openly acknowledge the Lord and are in the life of charity. This is evident from the signification of "crying out and saying, How long, O Lord," as being to pour out to the Lord sighs from grief, for these are the words of those that groan and sigh and supplicate for justice. Also from the signification of "holy and true," as being the One who is Justice; for justice when predicated of the Lord, signifies that He does not tolerate such things, and this because He is holy and true. Also from the signification of "to judge and avenge our blood," as being the judgment and removal of those who persecute and infest those who openly acknowledge the Lord and are in the life of charity. This is the signification of these words because "blood" signifies all violence offered to Divine good and Divine truth, thus to the Lord; consequently violence offered to those who are in the life of charity and faith. To offer violence to these is to offer violence to the Lord Himself, according to the words of the Lord Himself in Matthew:<p>Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of My least brethren, ye did it unto Me (<a href="../ae/329.htm">329</a>. Also from the signification of "those that dwell on the earth," as being those who were in "the former heaven" that afterwards passed away, for those dwelt in the spiritual world upon the earth, upon mountains, hills, and rocks, while those who acknowledged the Lord and were in the life of charity abode under the earth, or under heaven, and were there concealed and preserved (See above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/392.htm">392</a>).</p><p>[2] From this the meaning of these words in their genuine sense can be seen; but no one can know that such things are meant unless it has been revealed to him. For otherwise who could know who are meant by "the souls of those slain," and what is meant by "to avenge their blood upon those that dwell on the earth?" One who does not know from revelation who these are must conclude that the martyrs only are meant; when yet these were not the martyrs, but all such as were persecuted and infested by those who were in the former heaven that passed away; for these were such that they thrust out from themselves all who openly acknowledged the Lord and were in the life of charity, because they were interiorly evil (as has been said above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>, <a href="../ae/392.htm">392</a>).<p>To this I will add the following: All in the spiritual world who are interiorly evil, however moral a life in externals they may have lived in the world, are utterly unable to tolerate anyone who worships the Lord and lives the life of charity; as soon as they see such, they infest and either do them injury or treat them shamefully. I have often wondered at this, and all who do not know about it must wonder, since these same persons, when in the world, tolerated preachings respecting the Lord and also respecting charity, and themselves talked about these things doctrinally, yet when they become spirits they cannot tolerate them. The reason is that this aversion is inherent in their evil in which they are; for in their evil there is hostility, yea, hatred against the Lord, and also against those who are led by the Lord, who are those who are in the life of charity; but this hostility and this hatred lie concealed in their spirit; consequently when they become spirits they are in them; then that antipathy or antagonism inherent in evil comes forth.</p><p>[3] Take, for example, those in whom the love of ruling has predominated; it is their delight to rule over others, and if possible over all; this delight is in them after death, nor can it be removed, since every delight is of the love, and the predominant love constitutes the life of everyone, and this life remains to eternity. When these have become spirits, they strive continually, from the delight of their love, to gain dominion over others as they did in the world; and when they are unable to obtain it, they are angry against the Lord; and as they are unable to harm the Lord Himself, they are angry against those who openly acknowledge Him; for the delight of their love is contrary to the delight of heavenly love; this delight is that the Lord may rule, while the other delight is that they themselves may rule; this is why there is inherent in this delight a hatred against the Lord and against all who are led by Him, who are those who are in the life of charity. From this it can be seen why those who openly acknowledged the Lord and lived the life of charity were delivered by the Lord from the violence of such spirits, and were concealed in the lower earth, and there preserved until the judgment. But after the judgment those who had dwelt above the earth, upon the mountains, hills, and rocks there, who were, as said above, interiorly evil, were cast out; and those who had been hidden under the earth, or under heaven, were elevated and allotted an inheritance in the places from which the former were cast out. From this it can now be more fully comprehended what is meant by what is said to them in the next verse, that "they should rest yet a little time, until they should be fulfilled." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 394 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>394. "Dicentes, Usque quo Domine, qui Sanctus et Verus, non judicas et vindicas sanguinem nostrum de habitantibus super terra?" - Quod significet suspiria ad Dominum, qui Justitia, de judicio et remotione illorum qui persequuntur et infestant illos qui profitentur Domine in et in charitatis vita sunt, constat ex significatione clamare et dicere "Usque quo Domine", quod sit ex dolore suspiria edere ad Dominum, sunt enim voces gementium et suspirantium, ac supplicantium de justitia; ex significatione "qui Sanctus et Verus", quod sit qui Justitia, nam justitia, cum de Domino, significat quod talia non toleret, et hoc quia est Sanctus et Verus; ex significatione "judicare et vindicare sanguinem nostrum", quod sit judicare et removere illos qui persequuntur et infestant illos qui profitentur Dominum et in vita charitatis sunt; quod haec per illa verba significentur, est quia per "sanguinem" significatur omnis violentia illata Divino Bono et Divino Vero, ita Domino, proinde violentia illata illis qui in charitatis et fidei vita sunt: his violentiam inferre est Ipsi Domino, secundum Ipsius Domini verba apud Matthaeum,<p>"In quantum fecistis uni ex fratribus meis minimis, Mihi fecistis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_40" target=_top>25:40</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_45" target=_top>45</a>):<p>quod hoc per "sanguinem" in eo sensu significetur, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_329" target=_top>329</a>(f, g)); et ex significatione "habitantium super terra", quod sint qui in priori caelo quod postea transivit; illi enim habitaverunt super terra, super montibus, collibus et petris in mundo spirituali, et tunc illi qui agnoverunt Dominum et in charitatis vita fuerunt, commorati sunt sub terra seu sub caelo, et ibi reconditi et reservati (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a>(a), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_392" target=_top>392</a>(a)).<p>[2] Ex his constare potest quid per illa verba in suo sensu genuino intelligitur; sed scire quod talia intelligantur, nemo potest, nisi cui revelatum est; quis enim alioqui sciturus est quinam intelliguntur per "animas occisorum", et quid intelligitur per "vindicare sanguinem suum de habitantibus super terra"? Qui non scit ex revelatione quinam sunt, opinaturus est quod solum martyres intelligantur; cum tamen non martyres, sed omnes illi qui persecutionem passi et infestati sunt ab illis qui in priori caelo quod transivit, fuerunt; illi enim tales fuerunt ut a semet ejecerint omnes qui Dominum professi sunt, et in charitatis vita fuerunt, quoniam interius mali fuerunt (ut supra etiam, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_391" target=_top>391</a>(a), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_394/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_392" target=_top>392</a>(a), dictum est). Quibus haec addam:Omnes illi in mundo spirituali qui interius mali sunt, utcunque moralem vitam in externis in mundo egerunt, prorsus non sustinere possunt aliquem qui Dominum adorat, et qui charitatis vitam vivit; hos ut primum vident, infestant, et vel damno vel probro afficiunt: quod ita sit saepe miratus sum, et quoque omnes qui non id sciunt miraturi sunt; quoniam iidem sustinuerunt in mundo praedicationes de Domino et quoque de charitate, et quoque doctrinaliter de illis ipsi locuti sunt; at usque dum spiritus fiunt, non sustinent: sed causa est quia hoc insitum est malo eorum in quo sunt; in malo enim eorum est inimicitia, immo odium contra Dominum, et quoque contra illos qui ducuntur a Domino, qui sunt qui in charitatis vita sunt; sed inimicitia illa et odium illud latet in spiritu eorum, quapropter in illis sunt quando fiunt spiritus; prodit tunc antipathia illa seu oppositio insita malo.<p>[3] Sint pro exemplo illi apud quos amor regnandi praedominatus est: illorum jucundum est dominari super alios, et si possunt, super omnes; hoc jucundum inest illis post mortem, nec potest auferri, quoniam omne jucundum est amoris, et amor praedominans facit vitam cujusvis, et haec vita manet in aeternum. Hi, quando fiunt spiritus, cum ex jucundo amoris sui affectant continue dominium super alios, sicut in mundo, et non possunt, irascuntur Domino; et quia Ipsum non possunt damno afficere, irascuntur illis qui Dominum profitentur; jucundum enim amoris eorum est oppositum jucundo amoris caelestis: hoc jucundum est ut Dominus regnet, illud autem jucundum est ut ipsi regnent; quae causa est quod huic jucundo insitum sit odium contra Dominum, et contra omnes qui ab Ipso ducuntur, qui sunt qui in charitatis vita sunt. Ex his videri potest causa, cur illi qui professi sunt Dominum et charitatis vitam egerunt, a Domino exempti sint talium violentiae, ac reconditi in terra inferiore, et ibi reservati usque ad judicium: post judicium autem illi qui habitaverunt supra terram, super montibus, collibus et petris ibi, qui fuerunt, ut supra dictum, interius mali, ejecti sunt; et illi qui reconditi sub terra seu sub caelo, elevati, ac hereditatem sortiti in locis unde priores ejecti sunt. Ex his nunc plenius comprehendi potest quid intelligitur per haec in versu sequenti, quod "dictum sit eis ut requiescerent adhuc tempus parvum, usque dum complentur." </p>
