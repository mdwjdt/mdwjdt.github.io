<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 606</h4><p>606. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth.- That this signifies the Lord, to whom all things of heaven and the church are subject, is evident from the signification of an angel coming down out of heaven, as denoting the Lord (see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord, whose dominion over all things of heaven and the church, is meant by all things being put under His feet.<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"I will make the place of my feet honourable" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_13.htm">60:13</a>).<p>The place of the feet of the Lord, in the general sense, means all things of heaven and the church, because the Lord as the Sun is above the heavens; but, in a particular sense, by the place of His feet is signified the church, for the Lord's church is with men in the natural world, and the Natural is the ultimate, in which the Divine closes, and upon which it rests, as it were. For this reason the church on earth is also called the footstool of the Lord; as in the same prophet:<p>"The earth is my footstool" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">66:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>).<p>Also in Lamentations:<p>"He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, nor doth he remember his footstool" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_1.htm">2:1</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"We will go into his tabernacles; we will bow down at his footstool" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>).<p>This also is said of the Lord, and by His footstool is signified the church on earth.</p><p>[2] From these things it is evident that by standing upon the sea and upon the earth, when used in reference to the Lord, is signified that all things of heaven and the church are subject to Him. But specifically the sea and the earth, upon which He set His feet, signify the ultimate heaven, and the church on earth, as just stated. For the upper parts of the body of the angel, signify the higher heavens, because they correspond to them; for the inmost heaven corresponds to the head, the middle heaven, to the breast, as far as the loins, and the ultimate heaven to the feet, but the church on earth, to the soles of the feet, therefore this latter is meant by His footstool. It may be concluded from this correspondence that in general and particular by the angel standing upon the sea and upon the earth, by whom the Lord is meant, represented the whole heaven, for the Lord is heaven, and His Divine Human forms it according to the image of itself, for this reason the whole heaven in the sight of the Lord is as one man, and corresponds to all things of man, consequently heaven is also called the Grand Man (Maximus Homo). See what is said on this subject in <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-102</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 606</h4><p>606. Verse 5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, signifies the Lord, to whom all things of heaven and the church are subject. This is evident from the signification of "the angel coming down from heaven," as being the Lord (See above, n. <a href="../ae/593.htm">593</a>); and from the signification of "standing upon the sea and upon the earth," as being to whom all things of heaven and the church are subject (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/600.htm">600</a>, since "standing upon them" signifies that they are subject to Him. Thus in David:<p>Thou madest Him to have dominion over the works <sup>1</sup>of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under His feet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord; His dominion over all things of heaven and the church is meant by "all things are put under His feet." And in Isaiah:<p>I will make the place of My feet honorable (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>).<p>"The place of the Lord's feet" in a general sense means all things of heaven and the church, since the Lord as a sun is above the heavens; but in a particular sense "the place of His feet" signifies the church, for the Lord's church is with men in the natural world, and the natural is the lowest, into which the Divine closes, and upon which it as it were subsists. This is why the church on the earth is also called "the footstool of the Lord," as in the same:<p>The earth is My footstool (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>).<p>Also in Lamentations:<p>He hath cast down from the heavens unto the earth the splendor of Israel, and doth not remember His footstool (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>).<p>And in David:<p>We will come into His tabernacles, we will bow down at His footstool (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_7.htm">Psalms 132:7</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord, and "His footstool" signifies the church on the earth.</p><p>[2] From this it can be seen that "to stand upon the sea and upon the earth" signifies in reference to the Lord that all things of heaven and the church are subject to Him. But "sea and earth upon which He set His feet," signify in particular the lowest heaven and the church on earth, as has just been said; for the higher parts of the body belonging to an angel signify the higher heavens, because they correspond to them; for the inmost heaven corresponds to the head, and the middle heaven to the breast down to the loins, and the ultimate heaven to the feet, but the church on the earth to the soles of the feet, consequently the church is meant by "His footstool." From this correspondence it can be concluded what the "angel (by whom is meant the Lord) standing upon the sea and upon the earth" represented in general and in particular, namely, that He represented the universal heaven; for the Lord is heaven, and His Divine Human forms heaven to an image of itself. This is why the whole heaven is in the sight of the Lord as one man, and corresponds to all things of man, therefore heaven also is called the Greatest Man.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 606 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>606. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_10_5" target=_top>5</a>.] "Et angelus, quem vidi stantem super mari et super terra." - Quod significet Dominum, cui subjecta sunt omnia caeli et ecclesiae, constat ex significatione "angeli descendentis e caelo", quod sit Dominus (de qua supra n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_593" target=_top>593</a>); et ex significatione "stantis super mari et super terra", quod sit cui subjecta sunt omnia caeli et ecclesiae (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_600" target=_top>600</a> [a]); inde per "stare super illis" significatur illa Ipsi subjecta esse:<p>Ut quoque apud Davidem,<p>"Dominari fecisti Ipsum super <sup>1</sup></p><p>opera manuum tuarum; omnia posuisti sub pedes Ejus" (Psalms 8:7 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_8_6" target=_top>6</a>]):<p>hoc de Domino; dominium Ipsius super omnia caeli et ecclesiae intelligitur per quod "omnia posita sint sub pedes Ejus." Et apud Esaiam,<p>"Locum pedum meorum honorabilem reddam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_13" target=_top>60:13</a>):<p>per "locum pedum Domini" in communi sensu intelliguntur omnia caeli et ecclesiae, quoniam Dominus ut Sol est supra caelos; at in sensu particulari per "locum pedum" significatur ecclesia, nam ecclesia Domini est apud homines in mundo naturali, et naturale est ultimum, in quod Divinum desinit et super quo quasi subsistit: inde est quod ecclesia in terris etiam dicatur "scabellum pedum Domini", apud eundem,<p>"Terra scabellum pedum meorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_1" target=_top>66:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_35" target=_top>Matthaeus 5:35</a>);<p>tum in Threnis,<p>"Projecit e caelis in terram decus Israelis, nec recordatur scabelli pedum suorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_2_1" target=_top>2:1</a>);<p>et apud Davidem,<p>"Intrabimus in habitacula Ipsius, incurvabimus nos scabello pedum Ipsius" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_7" target=_top>Psalms 132:7</a>):<p>haec de Domino, et per "scabellum pedum Ipsius" intelligitur ecclesia in terris.<p>[2] Ex his constare potest quod per "stare super mari et super terra", cum de Domino, significetur quod omnia caeli et ecclesiae Ipsi subjecta sint. In specie autem per "mare et terram" supra quae posuit pedes suos, significatur caelum ultimum, et ecclesia in terris, ut nunc dictum est: nam per partes corporis superiores, quae fuerunt angelo, significantur caeli superiores, quia correspondent illis; caelum enim intimum correspondet capiti, caelum medium pectori usque ad lumbos, et caelum ultimum pedibus, ecclesia autem in terris plantis pedum; unde est quod haec intelligatur per "scabellum pedum." Ex hac correspondentia concludi potest quid in genere et in specie repraesentatum est per "angelum", per quem intelligitur Dominus, "stantem super mari et super terra"; nempe quod repraesentatum sit universum caelum; Dominus enim est caelum, ac Divinum Humanum Ipsius format illud ad Sui imaginem: inde est quod totum caelum in conspectu Domini sit sicut unus homo, et quod correspondeat omnibus hominis; quare etiam caelum vocatur Maximus Homo. (Sed de hac re videantur quae in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_606/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 59-102</a>, allata sunt, )<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
