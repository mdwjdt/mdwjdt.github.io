<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1014</h4><p>1014. (Verse 18) And there were voices, and lightnings, and thunders. That this signifies reasonings, darkness of the understanding, and conclusions of falsities from evils, is evident from the signification of voices, lightnings, and thunders, when said of those who belong to the church, with whom there is no longer any good of love or truth of faith, as denoting reasonings, darkness of the understanding, and conclusions formed from falsities from evils (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/702.htm">702</a>, <a href="../ae/704.htm">704</a>). That such things are signified by voices, lightnings, and thunders, in the Word, is from the appearances of these in the spiritual world amongst those who are not in the good of love and in the truths of faith, but who nevertheless talk with each other about them. Such discourse, which is reasoning, is signified by voices; the conflict of truth and falsity, by lightnings, and the consequent rejection of truth and good, by thunders. And because such things are from correspondence in the spiritual world, it follows that similar things in the natural world correspond, and that, consequently, such things as we have mentioned are thereby signified.<p>Continuation concerning the Seventh Precept:-</p><p>[2] From what has been said above, it is evident that all those who are in evils of life, and in falsities therefrom, are murderers, for they are enemies and haters of good and truth. For evil hates good, and falsity hates truth. An evil man does not know that he is in such hatred until he becomes a spirit, then hatred is the very delight of his life. Therefore from hell, where all the evil are, there constantly exhales a delight of doing evil from hatred; but from heaven, where all the good are, there continually breathes forth a delight of doing good from love. Hence two opposite spheres meet each other in the midst between heaven and hell, and mutually fight against each other. In this mid-region is a man while in the world. If he is then in evil, and in falsities therefrom, he passes into the regions of hell, and thence comes into the delight of doing evil from hatred. But if he is in good, and truths therefrom, he passes over to the regions of heaven, and thence comes into the delight of doing good from love.</p><p>[3] The delight of doing evil from hatred, which exhales from hell, is the delight of killing. But because they cannot kill the body, they desire to kill the spirit; and to kill the spirit is to deprive it of spiritual life, which is the life of heaven.<p>From these things it is clear that the precept, "Thou shalt not kill," involves also, that thou shalt not hate thy neighbour, also, that thou shalt not hate the good of the church and its truth; for if thou hatest good and truth, then thou hatest thy neighbour, and to hate is to desire to kill.<p>Hence it is that the devil, by whom is meant hell in its whole extent, is called by the Lord "A murderer from the beginning." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1014</h4><p>1014. Verse 18. And there were voices, lightnings, and thunders, signifies reasonings, darkenings of the understanding, and conclusions of falsities from evils. This is evident from the signification of "voices, lightnings, and thunders," which in reference to those of the church with whom there is no longer any good of love and truth of faith mean reasonings, darkness of the understanding, and conclusions of falsities from evils (See above n. <a href="../ae/702.htm">702</a>, <a href="../ae/704.htm">704</a>). This signification in the Word of "voices, lightnings, and thunders," is derived from the appearance of these in the spiritual world with those who are not in the good of love and in the truths of faith, but who talk with each other about them. Their discourse, which is reasoning, is signified by "voices," the conflict of truth and falsity by "lightnings," and consequent rejection of truth and good by "thunders." And as such things come forth in the spiritual world by correspondence, it follows that the like things in the natural world correspond, and thus have such signification as has been said.<p>(Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment)</p><p>[2] From what has been said above it can be seen that all who are in evils as to life, and in the falsities therefrom, are murderers; for they are enemies and haters of good and truth, since evil hates good and falsity hates truth. The evil man does not know that he is in such hatred until he becomes a spirit; then hatred is the very delight of his life. Consequently from hell, where all the evil are, there constantly breathes forth the delight in doing evil from hatred; but from heaven, where all the good are, there constantly breathes forth the delight in doing good from love. Therefore two opposite spheres meet each other in the middle region between heaven and hell, and engage in reciprocal combat. While man lives in the world he is in this middle region. If he is then in evil and in falsities therefrom he passes over to the side of hell, and thus comes into the delight of doing evil from hatred. But if he is in good and in truths therefrom, he passes over to the side of heaven, and thus comes into the delight of doing good from love.</p><p>[3] The delight of doing evil from hatred, which breathes forth from hell, is the delight in killing. But as they cannot kill the body they wish to kill the spirit; and to kill the spirit is to take away spiritual life, which is the life of heaven. This makes clear that the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," involves also "thou shalt not hate thy neighbor, also thou shalt not hate the good of the church and its truth;" for if one hates good and truth he hates the neighbor; and to hate is to wish to kill. This is why the devil, by whom hell in the whole complex is meant, is called by the Lord, "A murderer from the beginning" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_44.htm">John 8:44</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1014 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1014. (Vers. 18.) "Et factae sunt voces, fulgura et tonitrua." - Quod significet ratiocinationes, caligationes intellectus, et conclusiones falsorum ex malis, constat ex significatione "vocum, fulgurum et tonitruum", cum de illis ab ecclesia apud quos non amplius est bonum amoris et verum fidei, quod sint ratiocinationes, caligationes intellectus et conclusiones falsorum ex malis (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1014/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_702" target=_top>702</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1014/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_704" target=_top>704</a>); quod talia per "voces, fulgura et tonitrua" in Verbo significentur, est ex apparentia illorum in mundo spirituali apud illos qui non in bono amoris et in veris fidei sunt, ac inter se loquuntur de illis; locutio tunc, quae est ratiocinatio, significatur per "voces", conflictus veri et falsi per "fulgura", et inde rejectio veri et boni per "tonitrua"; et quia talia in mundo spirituali ex correspondentia existunt, sequitur quod similia in mundo naturali correspondeant, ac inde talia quae dicta sunt significentur.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Septimo Praecepto.)<p>Ex supradictis constare potest quod omnes qui in malis quoad vitam sunt, et inde falsis, homicidae sint; sunt enim hostes et osores boni et veri, malum enim odit bonum, et falsum odit verum. Nescit homo malus quod in tali odio sit, antequam fit spiritus; tunc odium est ipsum jucundum vitae ejus: quapropter ex inferno, ubi omnes mali sunt, continue exspirat jucundum malefaciendi ex odio; ex caelo autem, ubi omnes boni sunt, continue exspirat jucundum benefaciendi ex amore; inde binae sphaerae oppositae in medio inter caelum et infernum sibi obviam fiunt, ac mutuo inter se pugnant: in hoc medio est homo, dum vivit in mundo; si tunc in malo et inde falsis est, transit in partes inferni, et inde venit in jucundum malefaciendi ex odio; si autem in bono et inde veris est, transit in partes caeli, et inde venit in jucundum benefaciendi ex amore.<p>[3] Jucundum malefaciendi ex odio, quod ex inferno exspirat, est jucundum occidendi; sed quia corpus occidere nequeunt, volunt spiritum; et occidere spiritum, est deprivare vita spirituali, quae est vita caeli. Ex his patet quod praeceptum, "Non occides", involvat etiam Non odio habebis proximum, tum Non odio habebis bonum ecclesiae et verum ejus; nam si odio habes bonum et verum, tunc odio habes proximum; et odio habere est velle occidere. Inde est quod diabolus, per quem intelligitur infernum in omni complexu, a Domino dicatur<p>"Homicida ab initio" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1014/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_44" target=_top>Johannes 8:44</a>). </p>
