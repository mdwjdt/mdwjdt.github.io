<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1012</h4><p>1012. (Verse 17) And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. That this signifies the state of the church manifested as to all things of thought, is evident from the signification of the angel pouring out the vial, as denoting the state of the church manifested, as above; and from the signification of the air, as denoting thought, in this case everything of thought, because it is the last state of the church that is here described; therefore on the manifestation of that state, it is said, "It is done, that is, consummated."<p>The reason why the air signifies thought is, that respiration, which takes place by means of the air, corresponds to the thought of the understanding, as the motion of the heart corresponds to the affection of the will. That the respiration of the lungs corresponds to thought is quite clear from the fact that their operation is simultaneous and synchronous. For as a man thinks so he breathes. If he thinks tacitly he also breathes tacitly, and, on the contrary, if he thinks forcibly. If he thinks intensely and interiorly in himself, he then by degrees checks respiration, and also suspends it. Thus a man varies the state of his respiration in accommodation to every state of his thought. The reason is, that a man has two lives - the life of the understanding and the life of the will; and all the things of the body correspond to those two lives of the mind. Thus, in general, the life of the respiration corresponds to the life of the understanding and of the thought therefrom; and the life of the motion of the heart corresponds to the life of the will and of the love therefrom. These two lives are also meant by soul and heart in the Word, where it is said, with the whole soul and the whole heart, which signifies with the whole understanding and the whole will; or, with every thought of faith, and every affection of love. These things are said, in order that it may be known, that by the air is signified thought, because breathing takes place by its means.</p><p>[2] The reason why the vial was, lastly, poured out into the air is, that everything in a man closes in his thoughts. For such as a man is as to the church and the goods and truths of the church, also as to love; in a word, such as he is as to his spiritual, moral, and civil life, such is he as to thought. And this may especially be observed in the spiritual world; for when any angel comes out of his own society into one not his own, his breathing then labours, because he does not think from a similar affection. This also is why an infernal spirit when he ascends into an angelic society experiences difficulty and pain in breathing, and comes into fancifulness and blindness of thought. From these things it is evident that such as a man is, such is his thought.</p><p>[3] In what follows some things shall now be related concerning the Seventh Precept, which is, "Thou shalt not kill."<p>All the precepts of the Decalogue, like everything in the Word, involve two internal senses, besides the highest, which is the third; one which is proximate, and is called the spiritual-moral sense; another which is more remote, and is called the celestial-spiritual sense. The proximate sense of this precept, "Thou shalt not kill," which is the spiritual-moral sense, is, that thou shalt not hate thy brother or thy neighbour, and thence not treat him with contempt and ignominy; for thus thou dost damage and destroy his good name and honour, from which is his life amongst his brethren, called civil life. Consequently, he will afterwards live in society as dead, being numbered amongst the vile and wicked, with whom no one will hold any intercourse. This, when done from enmity, hatred, or revenge, is murder. This proceeds, and is estimated by many in the world, in a way similar to that of the life of the body. He, therefore, who does this, is as guilty before the angels in the heavens as if he had killed his brother. For enmity, hatred, and revenge breathe out murder, and would do this unless restrained and held in by the fear of the law, of resistance, and of reputation. Still these three are efforts to murder; and every effort is as an act, for it goes forth into act when fear is removed. These things the Lord teaches in Matthew:<p>"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill, and whoso shall kill shall be liable to judgment. But I say unto you, that whoso is angry with his brother rashly, shall be liable to judgment; and whoso shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to the gehenna of fire" (<a href="../ae/693.htm">693</a>, <a href="../ae/746.htm">746</a>).</p><p>[4] But the more remote sense of this precept, "Thou shalt not kill," which is called the celestial-spiritual sense, is, Thou shalt not take away from a man the faith and love of God, and thus his spiritual life, this being murder itself. For from this life a man is a man, the life of the body serving thereto as the instrumental cause to its principal cause.<p>From this spiritual murder comes moral murder. Therefore he who is in the one is also in the other; for he who desires to take away man's spiritual life hates him if he cannot take it away; for he hates his faith and love, and thus the man himself.<p>These three, namely, spiritual murder, which is that of faith and love; moral murder, which is that of good name and honour; and natural murder, which is that of the body, follow in a series, one from the other, as cause and effect. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1012</h4><p>1012. Verse 17. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air, signifies the state of the church manifested in regard to all things of thought. This is evident from the signification of "the angel pouring out the vial," as being the state of the church manifested (as above); also from the signification of the "air," as being thought, here everything of thought, because the last state of the church is here described; therefore when this state has been manifested it is said, "It is done," that is, it is consummated. The "air" signifies thought because respiration, which is effected by means of the air, corresponds to thought, which is of the understanding, as the motion of the heart corresponds to affection, which is of the will. That the respiration of the lungs corresponds to thought is clearly evident from the fact that they operate simultaneously and harmoniously, for as man thinks so he breathes. If he thinks quietly he breathes quietly, and reversely if forcibly. If he thinks intensely and interiorly in himself, respiration is gradually arrested and withdrawn. Thus man varies the state of his respiration in accommodation to every state of his thought. The reason of this is that man has two lives, namely, the life of the understanding and the life of the will; and all things of the body correspond to these two lives of the mind. Thus in general the life of the respiration corresponds to the life of the understanding and consequent thought; and the life of the motion of the heart corresponds to the life of the will and the consequent love. These two lives are meant by "soul" and "heart" in the Word, where it is said "with the whole soul and with the whole heart," which signifies with the whole understanding and the whole will, or with every thought which is of faith and with every affection which is of love. This is said to make known that the "air," since respiration is effected by it, signifies thought.</p><p>[2] "The last vial was poured out into the air," because all things of man close into his thoughts. For such as a man is as to the church and as to the goods and truths of the church, also as to love, in a word, such as he is as to his spiritual, moral, and civil life, such is he as to thought. This can be perceived especially in the spiritual world. When any angel goes out of his own society into a society not his own his breathing labors, because he is not thinking from a like affection. So, too, when an infernal spirit ascends into an angelic society he comes into distress of breathing, and thus into anguish, or into fantasy, or into blindness of thought; which makes clear that such as a man is such is his thought.<p>(The Seventh Commandment) <sup>1</sup></p><p>[3] In what now follows something shall be said about the seventh commandment, which is, "Thou shalt not kill." In all the commandments of the Decalogue, as in all things of the Word, two internal senses are involved (besides the highest which is a third), one that is next to the letter and is called the spiritual moral sense, another that is more remote and is called the spiritual celestial sense. The nearest sense of this commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," which is the spiritual moral sense, is that one must not hate his brother or neighbor, and thus not defame or slander him; for thus he would injure or kill his reputation and honor, which is the source of his life among his brethren, which is called his civil life, and afterwards he would live in society as one dead, for he would be numbered among the vile and wicked, with whom no one would associate. When this is done from enmity, from hatred, or from revenge, it is murder. Moreover, by many in the world this life is counted and esteemed in equal measure with the life of the body. And before the angels in the heavens he that destroys this life is held to be as guilty as if he had destroyed the bodily life of his brother. For enmity, hatred, and revenge, breathe murder and will it; but they are restrained and curbed by fear of the law, of resistance, and of loss of reputation. And yet these three are endeavors towards murder; and every endeavor is like an act, for it goes forth into act when fear is removed. This is what the Lord teaches in Matthew:<p>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother rashly shall be liable to the judgment; whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire (<a href="../ae/693.htm">693</a>, <a href="../ae/746.htm">746</a>).</p><p>[4] But the more remote sense of this commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," which is called the celestial spiritual sense, is that one shall not take away from man the faith and love of God, and thus his spiritual life. This is murder itself, because from this life man is a man, the life of the body serving this life as the instrumental cause serves its principal cause. Moreover, from this spiritual murder moral murder is derived; consequently one who is in the one is also in the other; for he who wills to take away a man's spiritual life is in hatred against him if he cannot take it away, for he hates the faith and love with him, and thus the man himself. These three, namely, spiritual murder, which pertains to faith and love, moral murder, which pertains to reputation and honor, and natural murder, which pertains to the body, follow in a series one from the other, like cause and effect.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This order of the commandments reverses their usual order against killing and stealing. This order is found in the Septuagint. Elsewhere in treating of the Decalogue (in Arcana Coelestia, Doctrine of Life, and True Christian Religion) the traditional order is followed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1012 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1012. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1012/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_7_17" target=_top>17</a>.) "Et septimus angelus effudit phialam suam in aerem." - Quod significet statum ecclesiae manifestatum quoad omnia cogitationis, constat ex significatione "angeli effundentis phialam", quod sit status ecclesiae manifestatus (ut supra); et ex significatione "aeris", quod sit cogitatio, hic omne cogitationis, quia est ultimus status ecclesiae qui hic describitur; quare eo manifestato dicitur quod "factum sit", hoc est, consummatum. <p>Quod "aer" significet cogitationem, est quia respiratio, quae fit per aerem, correspondet cogitationi quae intellectus, sicut motus cordis correspondet affectioni quae voluntatis. Quod respiratio pulmonum correspondeat cogitationi, patet manifeste ex operatione utriusque simultanea et unanima; sicut enim homo cogitat, ita respirat; si tacite cogitat etiam tacite respirat, vicissim si fortiter; si intense ac interius in se cogitat, tunc respirationem paullatim sistit, et quoque subducit; ita homo statum respirationis suae secundum omnem statum cogitationis suae accommodate variat: causa est, quia binae sunt vitae hominis, nempe vita intellectus ac vita voluntatis; omnia corporis binis illis vitis mentis correspondent; ita in genere vita respirationis correspondet vitae intellectus et inde cogitationis, et vita motus cordis correspondet vitae voluntatis et inde amoris: hae binae vitae etiam intelliguntur per "animam" et "cor" in Verbo, ubi dicitur "tota anima et toto corde", per quae significatur toto intellectu et tota voluntate, seu omni cogitatione quae fidei et omni affectione quae amoris: haec dicta sunt, ut sciatur quod per "aerem", quia per illum fit respiratio, significetur cogitatio.<p>[2] Quod "phiala ultima effusa sit in aerem", est quia omnia hominis desinunt in ejus cogitationem; nam qualis est homo quoadecclesiam, et quoad ecclesiae vera et bona, tum quoad amorem, verbo, qualis est quoad vitam suam spiritualem, moralem et civilem, talis est quoad cogitationem: quod imprimis potest in mundo spirituali animadverti; quando aliquis angelus e sua societate in societatem non suam venit, tunc laborat respiratio ejus, ex causa quia non ex simili affectione cogitat; inde quoque est, si infernalis spiritus in societatem angelicam ascendit, tunc in angores quoad respirationem venit, et inde in dolorem, aut in phantasiam, aut in caecitatem quoad cogitationem: ex quibus patet quod qualis est homo talis sit cogitatio ejus.<p>[3] (Continuatio.)<p>In sequentibus nunc aliqua<p>DE SEPTIMO PRAECEPTO, QUOD EST, "NON OCCIDES, "<p>dicentur. Omnia praecepta decalogi, sicut omnia Verbi, involvunt binos sensus internos, praeter supremum qui est tertius; unum, qui est proximus et vocatur sensus spiritualis moralis, alterum qui est remotior et vocatur sensus caelestis spiritualis; sensus proximus hujus praecepti, "Non occides", qui est sensus spiritualis moralis, est quod fratrem seu proximum tuum odio non habiturus sis, et inde contumeliis et ignominia illum non affecturus, ita enim famam et honorem ejus, ex quibus vita ejus est inter fratres, quae vita civilis vocatur, laedis et occidis; unde in societatibus vivet postea sicut mortuus, numeratur enim inter viles et sceleratos, cum quibus non erit commercium; hoc cum fit ex inimicitia, ex odio aut ex vindicta, est homicidium, etiam pari gradu cum vita corporis a multis in mundo procedit et aestimatur; et quoque is qui id facit, coram angelis in caelis reus est sicut fratrem suum quoad vitam corporis ejus occidisset; nam inimicitia, odium et vindicta spirant necem et volunt illam, sed retinentur et refrenantur ex timore legis, resistentiae, et famae; sunt usque tria illa conatus ad necem, et omnis conatus est sicut actus, abit enim in actum remoto timore. Haec sunt quae Dominus docet apud Matthaeum,<p>"Audivistis quod veteribus dictum sit, Non occides; et quisquis occiderit, obnoxius erit judicio. Ego vero dico vobis, quod quisquis irascitur fratri suo temere, obnoxius erit judicio: quicunque .. dixerit fratri suo, Raka, obnoxius erit synedrio: quicunque autem dixerit, Stulte, obnoxius erit gehennae ignis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1012/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_21-26" target=_top>5:21-26</a>),<p>quae explicata videas supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1012/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_693" target=_top>693</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1012/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_746" target=_top>746</a>(f)).<p>[4] Sensus autem remotior hujus praecepti, "Non occides", qui vocatur sensus caelestis spiritualis, est quod non auferes homini fidem Dei et amorem, et sic vitam spiritualem; hoc ipsum homicidium est, nam homo ex hac vita est homo; vita corporis ei inservit sicut causa instrumentalis suae causae principali. Ex homicidio hoc spirituali derivatur etiam homicidium morale; quare qui in uno est etiam in altero est; qui enim vult homini auferre vitam spiritualem, is in odio est contra illum si non potest auferre illam, nam odit fidem et amorem apud illum, ita ipsum hominem. Tria illa, nempe homicidium spirituale quod est fidei et amoris, homicidium morale quod est famae et honoris, ac homicidium naturale quod est corporis, consequuntur in serie, unum ab altero, sicut causae et effectus. </p>
