<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 418</h4><p>418. Holding the four winds of the earth.- That this signifies the modification of its influx, is evident from the signification of the four winds of the earth, as denoting all the Divine in heaven, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of holding them as meaning to modify its influx. But what the modification of the influx of the Divine in heaven means, no one can know but him to whom it is revealed, and consequently in regard to the signification of holding the four winds of the earth. Without revelation, who would not suppose that by the winds are meant winds which the angels held back, for it is said, "that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree." But by the winds of the earth, here as elsewhere in the Word, is signified all the Divine from the Lord in heaven, specifically the Divine Truth, and for the reason that it flows from the Lord as the Sun into the whole heaven, and thence into the whole earth. Therefore, by holding the winds is signified to modify influx. But, in order that these things may be more clearly understood, the operation of that influx shall also be explained.<p>The Lord is the Sun of the angelic heaven, and from Him, as the Sun, proceed all the light and all the heat there. The light which proceeds is in its essence Divine Truth, because it is spiritual light; and the heat which proceeds is in its essence Divine Good, because it is spiritual heat. These flow forth from the Lord as the Sun into all the heavens, adapted for reception by the angels there, sometimes therefore somewhat gently, and sometimes more powerfully; when gently, then the good are separated from the evil; but when powerfully, then the evil are rejected. When, therefore, a last judgment is at hand, then the Lord first flows in gently, in order that the good may be separated from the evil. Since this separation is treated of in this chapter, therefore it is said "holding the four winds of the earth," by which is signified the modification of the influx of Divine Good and Divine Truth from the Lord. That the separation of the good from the evil is the subject treated of, is evident from what follows in this chapter; for it is said, "Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of God on their foreheads" (verse 3); and afterwards to the close of the chapter, those who were sealed, or the good separated from the evil, is the subject treated of. Further reference will be made to this separation, and also to the casting down of the evil into the hells, which afterwards takes place.</p><p>[2] The four winds signify all the proceeding Divine, because the winds of heaven signify the quarters of heaven, for the whole heaven is divided into four quarters - the eastern, western, southern, and northern. Into the two quarters, the eastern and the western, the influx of Divine Good from the Lord is more powerful than that of Divine Truth; and into the southern and northern quarters, the influx of Divine Truth is more powerful than that of Divine Good; therefore the latter are more in wisdom and intelligence, but the former more in love and charity. And because the whole heaven is divided into four quarters, signified by the four winds, therefore, by the four winds is signified all the proceeding Divine. The reason why they are called the four winds of the earth is, that by the earth is meant all the earth in the spiritual world, but in the spiritual sense earth (terra) signifies heaven and the church, upon which subject the preceding article may be consulted.</p><p>[3] It is evident from these facts what is meant by the four winds in other passages of the Word; as in Ezekiel:<p>The Lord Jehovih said unto me, "Prophesy unto the spirit, prophesy, and say to the spirit, Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. And when I prophesied, the spirit came into them, and they lived again" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">37:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_10.htm">10</a>).<p>This is said of the dry bones seen by the prophet, which mean the children of Israel, as is evident from the 11th verse, and by that vision is described the reformation and establishment of a new church from those who had not before been in any spiritual life. The dry bones denote those who are void of spiritual life. The spiritual life given them by the Lord from the church which exists in them is described by these words. By the spirit unto which he prophesied, and from which they lived again, is signified spiritual life, which is a life according to the truths of the Word. "Come from the four winds, O spirit," signifies from the Divine of the Lord in heaven, the four winds denoting the four quarters in heaven, and the four quarters denoting all the Divine there, as stated above. In the sense of the letter, by spirit is there meant the breath of respiration, which is wind. It is therefore said, "Come and breathe upon these slain;" and by the breath of respiration is equally signified spiritual life, as will be seen from what follows. Those who have no spiritual life are signified both by the slain and by dry bones.</p><p>[4] In Zechariah:<p>There were seen "four chariots coming out from between two mountains of brass. There were horses in them. And the angel said, "These are the four winds of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth" (<a href="../ae/355.htm">355</a>, <a href="../ae/364.htm">364</a>, <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>), where they are explained. By the four winds is there signified all the proceeding Divine, or the Divine Good and Divine Truth, from which the church exists; it is therefore said, "The four winds of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth." To go forth from before Him means to proceed. Those winds are called chariots and horses, because chariots signify doctrinals of good and truth, and horses the understanding of these, and both the latter and the former proceed from the Divine of the Lord.</p><p>[5] In the gospels, it is said the Son of man "shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4060.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4060</a>).</p><p>[6] In Daniel:<p>"The he-goat of the goats magnified himself exceedingly; but when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its place came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens" (<a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>), namely, that by the he-goat of the goats is signified faith separated from charity, consequently, those who imagine that they are saved because they know the doctrinals and truths of the Word, and yet care nothing for a life according to them. Horns signify truths, and in the opposite sense, as here, falsities; the great horn signifies the dominant falsity, that merely knowing and thence believing is salvation. That the great horn was broken, and in its place four notable ones came up toward the four winds of the heavens signifies, that from that one source of faith alone many falsities conjoined with evils arise; the great horn denoting the dominant falsity that faith alone saves, and its being broken, signifies division into the many falsities which arise therefrom. "In its place, four" signifies, their conjunction with evils; "toward the four winds of the heavens" signifies, in regard to every detail pertaining to falsity and evil; for the four winds of the heavens signify every good and truth of heaven and the church, and their conjunction, but in the opposite sense, every evil and falsity and their conjunction. The reason why the four winds of the heavens signify also every evil and falsity is, that not only those who are in the good of love, and in truths thence, dwell in the four quarters of the spiritual world, but also those who are in evils and falsities thence, the hells being in the same quarters, but deep under the heavens, for the most part in caverns, dens, and vaults. Concerning which, see above (n. <a href="../ae/410.htm">410</a>).</p><p>[7] In this same sense the winds of the heavens are mentioned in Jeremiah:<p>"And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens, and will scatter them toward all those winds; so that there is no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_36.htm">49:36</a>).<p>Here, by Elam are signified those who are in the knowledges of faith, but not at the same time in any charity; by "the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens," are signified falsities conjoined with evils; and by scattering them into all those winds, is signified into falsities of evil of every kind. "That there is no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come," signifies that there is no evil to which falsity cannot be adapted, nation denoting evil; for knowledges alone without the life of charity bring forth falsities of evil without number.</p><p>[8] In Daniel:<p>"I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_2.htm">7:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_3.htm">3</a>).<p>The four winds also, here, signify falsities conjoined with evils: the great sea signifies hell, where they originate, and the four beasts signify evils of every kind; but more will be said upon this subject in what follows. The same is meant by the "four winds" mentioned in Daniel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_11_4.htm">11:4</a>); and also in Zech. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_6.htm">2:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_7.htm">7</a>). That the four winds signify the four quarters, is fully evident in Ezekiel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_42_16.htm">42:16-19</a>), where the subject is the measure of the house according to the four winds, that is, the quarters. In Hebrew the same word is used for quarter as for wind and breath. More will be seen concerning winds in the following article. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 418</h4><p>418. Holding the four winds of the earth, signifies the moderation of its influx. This is evident from the signification of "the four winds of the earth" as being everything Divine in heaven (of which presently); also from the signification of "holding them," as being to moderate its influx. But what is meant by moderating the influx of the Divine in heaven no one can know unless it is revealed to him, nor consequently can it be known what is signified by "holding the four winds of the earth." Without revelation, who would not think that "winds" here mean winds held back by angels, since it also follows "that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree." But "the winds of the earth," here as elsewhere in the Word signify everything Divine that is from the Lord in heaven, in particular, Divine truth, and because Divine truth flows from the Lord as a sun into the whole heaven, and from that into the whole earth, so "holding the winds" signifies to moderate influx. But that these things may be more clearly understood, it shall be told how it is with respect to that influx. The Lord is the sun of the angelic heaven; from Him as a sun all light and all heat there proceed. The light that proceeds is in its essence Divine truth, because it is spiritual light; and the heat that proceeds is in its essence Divine good, because it is spiritual heat. From the Lord as a sun these flow out into all the heavens accommodated to reception by the angels there, thus sometimes more moderately, sometimes more intensely. When they flow out more moderately the good are separated from the evil, but when more intensely the evil are cast out. When, therefore, the Last Judgment is at hand the Lord first flows in moderately, in order that the good may be separated from the evil. Because this separation is what is treated of in this chapter, the "holding of the four winds of the earth" is first mentioned, which signifies the moderation of the influx of Divine good and Divine truth from the Lord. It is evident from what follows in this chapter that this refers to the separation of the good from the evil, for it is said, "Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor any tree, till we shall have sealed the servants of God on their foreheads" (verse 3); and afterwards, to the end of the chapter, "those sealed," that is, the good separated from the evil are treated of. But respecting this separation more will be said in what follows, likewise respecting the casting out of the evil into the hells, which takes place afterwards.</p><p>[2] "The four winds" signify all the Divine proceeding, because "the winds of heaven" signify the quarters of heaven, for the whole heaven is divided into four quarters, namely, east, west, south, and north. Into two quarters, the east and the west, the Lord flows with Divine good more powerfully than with Divine truth; and into two quarters, the south and the north, with Divine truth more powerfully than with Divine good; consequently those who are in the latter are more in wisdom and intelligence, and those in the former more in love and charity; and as the whole heaven is divided into four quarters, and those quarters are meant by "the four winds," therefore "the four winds" signify all the Divine proceeding. They are called "the four winds of the earth," because "the earth" means all the earth in the spiritual world, but in the spiritual sense "the earth" signifies heaven and the church (respecting which see the preceding article).</p><p>[3] From this the meaning of "the four winds" in other passages of the Word can be seen, as in Ezekiel:<p>The Lord Jehovih said unto me, Prophesy about the spirit, prophesy, and say to the spirit, Thus the Lord Jehovih hath said, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe into these slain that they may live. And when I had prophesied the spirit came, and they revived (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_10.htm">10</a>).<p>This is said of "the dry bones" seen by the prophet, by which the sons of Israel are meant (as is evident from verse 11 there); and this vision describes the reformation and establishment of a new church from those who have not before had any spiritual life. "The dry bones" are those who have nothing of spiritual life; the spiritual life given them by the Lord, from which the church is in them, is described by these words; "the spirit" about which the prophet prophesied, and by which they were revived, signifies spiritual life, which is a life according to the truths of the Word. "Come from the four winds, O spirit," signifies from the Divine of the Lord in heaven; "the four winds" meaning the four quarters in heaven, and the four quarters are everything Divine there (as has been said above). In the sense of the letter, "spirit" here means the breath (spiritus) of respiration, which is wind; it is therefore said that it should "come and breathe into these slain;" but the breath of respiration signifies as well the spiritual life, as will appear from what follows. "The slain" have a similar signification as "dry bones," namely, those who have no spiritual life.</p><p>[4] In Zechariah:<p>There were seen four chariots coming out from between two mountains of copper, to which there were horses; and the angel said, These are the four winds of the heavens, going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth (<a href="../ae/355.htm">355</a>, and what "the mountains of copper" signify, also above (n. <a href="../ae/364.htm">364</a>, <a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>), where they are explained. Here "the four winds" signify every Divine proceeding, or the Divine good and Divine truth that constitute the church; it is therefore said "the winds of the heavens going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth;" "to go forth from standing by Him" signifying to proceed. "Chariots" and "horses" are called winds because "chariots" signify the doctrinals of good and truth, and "horses" an understanding of them, and both of these proceed from the Divine of the Lord.</p><p>[5] In the Gospels:<p>The Son of man shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4060.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4060</a>.)</p><p>[6] In Daniel:<p>The he-goat made himself very great; but when he was strong the great horn was broken, and there came up in appearance four in its place towards the four winds of the heavens (<a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>, namely, that "he-goat" signifies faith separate from charity, and therefore those who expect to be saved because they know the doctrinals and truth of the Word, and who give no thought to a life according to them; "horns" signify truths, and in the contrary sense, as here, falsities; "the great horn" signifies the ruling falsity, which is, that salvation comes merely through knowing and thus believing; "the great horn was broken, and there came up four in its place toward the four winds of heaven," signifies that out of the one principle, faith alone, many falsities conjoined with evils arise; "the great horn" signifying the ruling falsity, which is, that faith alone saves; "broken" signifying its division into many falsities arising therefrom; "four in its place" signifying the conjunction of these with evils; "toward the four winds of the heavens," signifying in respect to each and all things of falsity and evil, for "the four winds of heaven" signify every good and truth of heaven and the church and their conjunction, but in the contrary sense every evil and falsity and their conjunction. "The four winds of the heavens" signify also every evil and falsity, because in the four quarters in the spiritual world not only those who are in the good of love and in truths therefrom dwell, but also those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom; for the hells are in the same quarters, but deep beneath the heavens, for the most part in caverns, caves, and vaults (respecting which see above, n. <a href="../ae/410.htm">410</a>.</p><p>[7] In this same sense "the winds of the heavens" are mentioned in Jeremiah:<p>Upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four ends of the heavens, and I will disperse him toward all those winds, that there may be no nation to which the outcasts of Elam shall not come (4 <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>).<p>Here "Elam" signifies those who are in the knowledges that are called the knowledges of faith, but not at the same time in any charity; "the four winds from the four ends of the heavens" signify falsities conjoined with evils; and "to disperse him toward all those winds" signifies into falsities of evil of every kind; "that there may be no nation to which the outcasts of Elam shall not come" signifies that there may be no evil to which falsity cannot be adapted, "nation" meaning evil, for knowledges alone without a life of charity bring forth innumerable falsities of evil.</p><p>[8] In Daniel:<p>I was seeing in my vision when it was night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens rushed upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">3</a>).<p>Here, too, "the four winds" signify falsities conjoined with evils, "the great sea" signifies hell from which they are, and "the four beasts" signify evils of every kind: but on this more in what follows. "The four winds" have a similar signification in Daniel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_11_4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>; also in Zechariah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_7.htm">7</a>). That "the four winds" signify the four quarters is clearly evident in Ezekiel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_42_16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-19</a>), where the measure of the house according to the four winds, that is, the four quarters, is treated of; and there the quarter is named by the same word in the Hebrew by which wind and spirit are named. But more will be seen concerning winds in the article that now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 418 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>418. "Retinentes quatuor ventos terrae." - Quod significet remissionem influxus ejus, constat ex significatione "quatuor ventorum terrae", quod sit omne Divinum in caelo (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "retinere illos", quod sit remittere influxum ejus: sed quid intelligitur per remissionem influxus Divini in caelo, nemo scire potest nisi cui revelatum est, et consequenter nec sciri potest quid significatur per "retentionem quatuor ventorum terrae. Absque revelatione, quis non opinaturus est quod per "ventos" ibi intelligantur venti qui ab angelis retenti? quoniam etiam sequitur, "ne flaret ventus super terram neque super mare, neque super omnem arborem": verum per "ventos terrae" hic ut alibi in Verbo significatur omne Divinum quod a Domino in caelo, in specie Divinum Verum; et hoc quia influit a Domino ut Sole in universum caelum et inde in universam terram, ideo per "retinere illos" significatur remittere iniluxum. Sed ut haec clarius intelligantur, dicetur etiam quoinodo se res habet cum influxu illo. Dominus est Sol caeli angelici; ex Ipso ut Sole procedit omllis lug et omnis calor ibi; lux quae procedit, est in sua essentia Divinum Verum, quia est lux spiritualis; ac calor qui procedit est in sua essentia Divinum Bonum, quia est calor spiritualis: haec effluunt a Domino ut Sole in omnes caelos accommodate ad receptionem ab angelis ibi; quare nunc remissius nunc intensius. Quando remissius, tunc separantur boni a malis; quando autem intensius, tunc rejiciuntur mali. Quapropter cum ultimum judicium instat, tunc Dominus primum remisse influit, ob causam ut separentur boni a malis. Quoniam in hoc capite de separatione illa agitur, ideo praemittitur de "retentione quatuor ventorum terrae", per quam significatur remissio influxus Divini Boni ac Divini Veri a Domino: quod de separatione bonorum a malis, patet a sequentibus hujus capitis, nam dicitur, "ne damno afficiatis terram, neque mare, neque omnem arborem, usque dum signaverimus servos Dei super frontibus eorum" (vers. 3); ac postea usque ad finem capitis agitur de "signatis", hoc est., de bonis separatis a malis. Sed de hac separatione plura in sequentibus dicentur; pariter de conjectione malorum in inferna, quae postea fit.<p>[2] Quod "quatuor venti" significent omne Divinum procedens, est quia per "ventos caeli" significantur plagae caeli; totum enim caelum distinctum est in quatuor plagas, nempe orientalem, occidentalem, meridionalem et septentrionalem: in binas plagas, orientalem et occidentalem, influit Dominus cum Divino Bono fortius quam cum Divino Vero; et in binas plagas, meridionalem et septentrionalem, cum Divino Vero fortius quam cum Divino <sup>1</sup></p><p>Bono; unde hi plus in sapientia et intelligentia sunt, illi autem plus in amore et charitate: et quia universum caelum distinctum est in quatuor plagas, et plagae illae intelliguntur per "quatuor ventos", ideo per "quatuor ventos" significatur omne Divinum procedens. Quod dicantur "quatuor venti terrae", est quia per "terram" intelligitur omnis terra in mundo spirituali, at in sensu spirituali per "terram" significatur caelum et ecclesia (de qua re videatur praecedens articulus).<p>[3] Ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per "quatuor ventos" alibi in Verbo:<p>Ut apud Ezechielem,<p>"Dixit" Dominus Jehovih ad me", Propheta super spiritu, propheta... et dic ad spiritum, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih; a quatuor ventis veni, spiritus, et inspira in occisos hos ut vivant; et cum prophetavi, ... venit spiritus, et revixerunt" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_418/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_9" target=_top>37:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_418/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_10" target=_top>10</a>):<p>haec de "ossibus aridis" visis prophetae, per quae intelliguntur filii Israelis (ut patet a vers. 11, ibi) ; ac per visionem illam describitur reformatio et instauratio novae ecclesiae ex illis qui non prius in aliqua vita spirituali fuerunt. "Ossa arida" sunt illi quibus non aliquid vitae spiritualis est; vita spiritualis quae illis a Domino data, ex qua apud illos ecclesia, describitur per illa verba; per "spiritum", super quo prophetaret, et ex quo revixerunt, significatur vita spiritualis, quae est vita secundum vera Verbi; "a quatuor ventis veni, spiritus", significat ex Divino Domini in caelo; "quatuor venti" sunt quatuor plagae in caelo, et quatuor plagae sunt omne Divinum ibi (ut supra dictum est).
