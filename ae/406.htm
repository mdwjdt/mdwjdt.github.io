<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 406</h4><p>406. Hitherto it has been shown what mountain signifies; it now remains to be shown what island signifies, for it is said,<p>"Every mountain and island were moved out of their places."<p>And elsewhere:<p>"Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_20.htm">Apoc. 16:20</a>).<p>By islands in the Word are not meant islands, nor those who dwell upon islands, but the natural man is meant as to the truths which are in him, and hence, in the abstract, the truths of the natural man are signified. The truths of the natural man are truths scientific (vera scientifica), which are under the view of the rational man, and the knowledges (cognitions) of truth are what are under the view of the spiritual man; knowledges of truth are what the natural man knows from the Word, and truths scientific are what the natural man sees from the Rational, by which also he is accustomed to confirm the truths of the church.<p>There are in man two minds, the one higher or interior, called the spiritual mind, and the other lower or exterior, called the natural mind. The natural mind is first opened and cultivated in men because this is nearest the world; the spiritual mind, however, is opened and cultivated afterwards, but only in proportion as man by life receives the knowledges of truth from the Word, or from doctrine from the Word; therefore it is not opened with those who do not apply them to the life. And when the spiritual mind is opened, then the light of heaven flows in through that mind into the natural [mind], and enlightens it, and thus this mind becomes spiritual-natural; for the spiritual mind then sees in the Natural, nearly as a man sees his face in a mirror, and acknowledges those things which agree with itself; but when the spiritual mind is not opened, as is the case with those who do not apply to their life the knowledges of truth and good in the Word, then a mind is still formed with such a man inwardly in the Natural, but this mind consists of actual evils and falsities. The reason is, that the spiritual mind is not opened, by which the light of heaven can be let into the Natural by a direct way, but only through chinks round about, whence a man has the faculty to think, to reason, and speak, and also the power to understand truths; but still not that of loving them, or of doing them from affection. For the faculty of loving truths because they are truths, is only possible by the influx of the light of heaven through the spiritual mind; for the light of heaven [flowing in] through the spiritual mind is conjoined with the heat of heaven, which is love, such as the light of the world is comparatively in the time of spring; but the light of heaven flowing only through chinks into the Natural, is a light separated from the heat of heaven, which is love, such as the light of the world is comparatively in the time of winter.<p>Hence it may be evident, that the man with whom the spiritual mind is opened, is like a garden and a paradise; and that the man with whom the spiritual mind is not opened, is like a desert, and land covered with snow; because the mind makes the man, for the mind of man consists of understanding and will; hence it is the same whether you say the mind or the man, or whether you say the spiritual and natural mind, or you say the spiritual and natural man. The natural mind, or natural man, as to its truths and falsities, is signified by islands in the Word; as to truths, with those with whom the spiritual mind is opened, and as to falsities, with those with whom the spiritual mind is shut.</p><p>[2] That these are signified by islands, is evident from the following passages in the Word.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"Thus said the Lord Jehovih to Tyre; Shall not the islands shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is accomplished in the midst of thee? And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones. The isles shall tremble in the day of thy fall, and the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure. All the inhabitants of the isles were astonished at thee, and their kings were sore afraid, their faces were troubled" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_15.htm">26:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_35.htm">27:35</a>).<p>In these two chapters the subject treated of is Tyre, by which is signified the church as to the knowledges (cognitions) of truth and good, and thence are signified in the abstract the knowledges of good and truth. The intelligence and wisdom of the men of the church, by the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, are here first treated of, and afterwards the church vastated as to these. The church vastated as to these, or where the knowledges of truth and good have perished, is described by what is said by the prophet in those verses; the vastation of the knowledges of truth and good by, "when the wounded cry, and when the slaughter is accomplished in the midst of thee," for by the wounded are meant those with whom truths are extinguished, and by the slaughter is meant the very extinction of truth and good. That then all the knowledges (cognitions) which man from his infancy has imbibed from the Word, and all the truths scientific by which he has confirmed them, are disturbed, moved out of their place, and recede, is signified by, "the islands shall shake, and all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones"; also by, "The isles shall tremble in the day of thy fall, and the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled"; the isles denoting such knowledges and scientifics as are in the natural man; the princes of the sea denoting primary things therein; the sea signifying the natural man and all things therein in general. That all the goods of truth of the natural man, from the knowledges of truth having been vastated, shall be changed as to their state, is signified by, "All the inhabitants of the isles were astonished at thee, and their kings were afraid, their faces were troubled." The inhabitants of the isles denote the goods of truth of the natural man; for by, to inhabit, in the Word, is signified to live, and by inhabitants, the goods of life; kings denote all truths from good; faces signify the interiors and the affections; to be astonished, afraid, and disturbed, signify to be altogether changed as to state. From these things it is evident what those things involve in the internal sense, namely, that all the knowledges of truth and good, and the confirming scientifics which a man from infancy has learnt from the Word, and from teachers, shall change their places and their state in the natural man, and are unseen, when falsities enter.</p><p>[3] In Isaiah:<p>"The king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt, and the crowd of Ethiopia [which is] to be carried away; then they shall be afraid and ashamed for Ethiopia their expectation, and for Egypt their glory; and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help, that we may be delivered from before the king of Assyria; and how shall we be liberated?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_4.htm">20:4-6</a>).<p>From these words no one can perceive anything respecting the church, but only a something obscurely historical, the occurrence of which is not known, as that the king of Assyria shall lead away Egypt and Ethiopia into captivity, and that the dwellers of some isle would grieve in heart over it; but yet, here as elsewhere, the concerns of the church are treated of, which concerns are evident when it is known that the king of Assyria signifies the Rational perverted, and thence reasoning from false scientifics which favour the delight of the natural loves, over which the natural man grieves, because it is perverted thereby. For by, "the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt, and the crowd of Ethiopia [which is] to be carried away," is signified, that the perverted Rational will claim to itself the scientifics of the natural man, and will confirm itself thereby, and also by its delights, which [such scientifics] favour. The king of Assyria denotes the perverted Rational; to lead captive, and carry away the crowd, denotes to apply them and to confirm them. Egypt denotes the scientific of the natural man, and Ethiopia denotes the delight which it favours. That the goods of truth of the natural man grieve on that account, or that the natural man, in which are the goods of truth, grieves, is signified by all those things that follow, namely, that "they shall be afraid and ashamed for Ethiopia their expectation, and for Egypt their glory; and the inhabitant of the isle shall say in that day"; with what follows. The inhabitant of the isle denotes the good of truth of the natural man, or the natural man in whom is the good of truth; the inhabitant signifying good, and an island truth, both in the natural man (as above). That there is such a sense in these words can hardly be believed, when yet it is therein.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>"They shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they shall cry from the sea. Wherefore honour Jehovah in the fire (urim), the name of the God of Israel in the isles of the sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_14.htm">24:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_15.htm">15</a>).<p>The vastation of the church is treated of in this chapter, and in these verses the establishment of a new church among the Gentiles; the joy of these is what is described by, "They shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they shall cry from the sea," or from the west. For by the sea, when the west is meant thereby, is signified the Natural. The reason is that those who dwell in the western quarter in the spiritual world are in natural good, but in the eastern quarter those who are in celestial good; and because the Gentiles, from whom the church [was formed], were in natural good, it is therefore said, honour ye Jehovah in the fire (urim), the name of the God of Israel in the isles of the sea. By this is signified that they would worship the Lord from the goods and truths of the natural man, for the term urim signifies fire, or a hearth, by which is denoted the good of love of the natural man. The isles of the sea signify the knowledges of truth and good, which are the truths of the natural man; and to honour signifies to worship and adore. By Jehovah and the God of Israel is meant the Lord, who is called Jehovah where the subject treated of is good, and the God of Israel where the subject is truth; it is therefore said, "honour ye Jehovah in the fire" (urim), that is, from good, and "the name of the God of Israel in the isles of the sea," that is, from truths. Hence also it is evident, that by the isles of the sea are signified the truths of the natural man.</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>"He shall not extinguish, neither break in pieces, till he have set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall hope in his law. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, his praise the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, its fulness; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands" (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>), where they are explained. By, "Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands," is signified worship from internals and externals. To give glory denotes worship from internals, and to declare praise denotes to worship from externals, for externals declare; and islands denote the truths of the natural man, from which worship [proceeds].</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>"Attend unto me, my people, and give ear unto me, O my nation; for a law shall proceed from me, and I will stir up my judgment for a light of the people. My justice is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall hope in me, and on mine arm shall they trust" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_4.htm">51:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_5.htm">5</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the Lord; "Attend unto me, my people, and give ear unto me, O my nation," signifies all of the church who are in truths and goods; people denoting those who are in truths, and nation those who are in goods. It is said, attend and give ear, in the plural, because all are meant. "A law shall proceed from me, and I will stir up my judgment for a light of the people," signifies that from Him [are] Divine good and Divine truth, whence is enlightenment; law signifying the Divine good of the Word, and judgment the Divine truth of the Word. For a light of the people signifies enlightenment. "My justice is near, my salvation is gone forth," signifies judgment, when those are saved who are in the good of love and in the truths thence. Justice is said of the salvation of those who are in good at the day of judgment, and salvation of the salvation of those who are in truths. "Mine arms shall judge the people," signifies judgment upon those of the church who are in falsities, people here being taken in an opposite sense. "The isles shall hope in me, and on mine arm shall they trust," signifies the approach of those to the church who are remote from the truths of the church, and their trust in the Lord; isles signifying, those who are remote from the truths of the church, because they are in natural light, and not yet in spiritual light from the Word; and to trust on His arm, signifies confidence in the Lord who has all power; arm, when said of the Lord, denoting omnipotence.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>"Listen, O isles, and hearken, ye people from afar" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">49:1</a>).<p>Isles [stand] for those who are in truths, and people from afar for those who are in goods, and, in the abstract, truths and goods, both in the natural man. From afar is said of the goods in the natural man, whereas near [is said] of the goods in the spiritual man. People here signify goods, because in the original tongue they are called by a different expression from the people by whom are signified truths; for by this expression they are also denominated nations, by whom are signified goods, as is evident from the same expression in Genesis (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_25_26.htm">25:26</a>).</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>"Hear the Word of Jehovah, ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_10.htm">31:10</a>).<p>Nations mean those who are in goods, and, in the abstract, goods; and islands mean those who are in truths, and, in the abstract, truths in the natural man. Afar off signifies remote from the truths of the church, which are spiritual (that afar off signifies this, may be seen, n. 8918); but those words, in the purely spiritual sense, signify that the internal man shall teach the external, or the spiritual the whole natural [man] the truths of the Word, for this it is that the nations declare in the islands afar off; but this pure sense, which the angels possess, can scarcely be perceived by men, because they are scarcely able to think apart from persons and places; because the thought of men is natural, and natural thought differs from spiritual thought in this, that it is tied down to places and persons, and is, consequently, more finite than the spiritual. This also is the reason why many things that have been explained, perhaps hardly fall into the ideas of the thought of those who keep the sight of the mind upon the meaning of the expressions.</p><p>[9] In David:<p>"The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring a present; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer a gift" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1171.htm">1171</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3240.htm">3240</a>; and that the former are meant by Tarshish, will be seen just below; and because those are meant, those also are meant who are in the knowledges of truth and good.</p><p>[10] In Isaiah:<p>"Who are these that fly as clouds, and as doves to their windows? Because the isles confide in me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring thy sons from far" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1977.htm">1977</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6385.htm">6385</a>; and that windows signify truths in light, and thence the intellectual part, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/655.htm">655</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/658.htm">658</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3391.htm">3391</a>.)</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>"Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house, nor doth any one enter; from the land of Chittim he shall plainly come to them. The inhabitants of the island are silent, the merchant of Zidon who passeth over the sea, they have replenished thee. Blush, O Zidon, for the sea saith, I have not travailed, neither brought forth the fortification of the sea. I have not brought up young men, I have not brought virgins to adult age. At the report from Egypt they shall be seized with grief, as at the report of Tyre. Pass over into Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">23:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_4.htm">4-6</a>).<p>The desolation of truth in the church is thus described; for by the ships of Tarshish are signified the knowledges of good from the Word, and by Tyre the knowledges of truth thence. That there is no longer good because there are no truths, is signified by, "Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house, nor doth any one enter in." That falsities then enter until there are no longer any goods of truth and truths of good in the natural man, is signified by, "from the land of Chittim he shall plainly come to them." The inhabitants of the island are silent, the merchant of Zidon, who passeth over the sea, they have replenished thee. The land of Chittim signifies falsities; the inhabitants of the island signify the goods of truth in the natural man, as explained above; the merchant of Zidon signifies knowledges from the Word; who passeth over the sea, signifies, which are in the natural man; who have replenished thee, namely, the ships of Tarshish, signifies, who have enriched thee by them. The vastation of truth and good in the natural man is further described by, "Blush, O Zidon; for the sea saith, I have not travailed, neither brought forth the fortification of the sea. I have not brought up young men, I have not brought virgins to adult age." By Zidon, as well as by Tyre, are signified the knowledges of truth and good in the church. By, the sea, even the fortification of the sea, is signified the whole natural man; by, I have not travailed, neither brought forth, is signified that there is not anything of the church conceived or generated; by young men are signified the affections of truth, and by virgins the affections of good. That this was the case in consequence of knowledges from the Word and confirming scientifics being applied to falsities and evils, is signified by, "at the report from Egypt they shall be seized with grief, as at the report of Tyre." Egypt signifies scientifics; Tyre, knowledges (cognitions) from the Word; here those vastated by falsities and evils to which they are applied; and inasmuch as there is lamentation on this account, it is therefore said, they shall be seized with grief. That all good would thus perish in the natural man, and [all] truth therein, is signified by, pass over into Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. Tarshish signifies the interior goods and truths in the natural [man]; the inhabitants of the isle signify the exterior goods and truths therein, as also above; to howl signifies grief on account of vastation.</p><p>[12] In Jeremiah:<p>"I took the cup out of Jehovah's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah sent me. All the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isle which is in the passage of the sea" (<a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>). The vastation of these things is meant by the cup of Jehovah which he made the nations to drink.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>"Because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth; for Jehovah layeth waste the Philistines, the remnant of the island of Caphtor" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8093.htm">8093</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8313.htm">8313</a>). By cutting off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth, is signified that they have no longer any knowledge of truth and good; the helper that remaineth signifies that they are no longer concordant; the same is also signified by the remnant of the island of Caphtor.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>"Pass over into the isles of the Chittimites, and see; send into Arabia, and consider well, and see whether there be such a thing, whether a nation hath changed their gods" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_10.htm">2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_12.htm">12</a>).<p>That they would pass over and send into the isles of the Chittimites and into Arabia, does not signify that they would send thither, but to all who live naturally in truths and goods according to their religion. The isles of the Chittimites denote where those are who live naturally in truths, and Arabia where they are who live naturally in goods, namely, according to their religion. The Chittimites and Arabia signify such persons and such things; for all those who have not the Word, or any revelation from heaven, and live according to their religion, live naturally; for to live spiritually is to live only according to truths and goods from the Word, and from revelation out of heaven.</p><p>[15] In Zephaniah:<p>"Jehovah will be formidable upon them: for he will make lean all the gods of the nations, that they may worship him, every one from his place; all the isles of the nations, ye Ethiopians also, shall be slain by my sword" (<a href="../njhd/21.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 21</a>.)</p><p>[16] In David:<p>"He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. The islands shall bow themselves before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_72_8.htm">Psalms 72:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_72_9.htm">9</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the Lord; and by having dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth, is meant His dominion over all things of heaven and the church; for in the spiritual world the boundaries are seas, and the intermediates are earths, where there are habitations for angels and spirits. Hence by, "from sea to sea," are signified all things of heaven, and because all things of heaven all things of the church are also signified; for the goods of love, and the truths thence, constitute heaven and also the church, therefore by, "from sea to sea," are signified also all things of the church. All things of heaven and of the church are signified by, "from the river unto the ends of the earth"; but by these words are signified all things of heaven and of the church as to truths, and by, from sea to sea, all things of heaven and of the church as to goods. For seas in the spiritual world are the boundaries of the earth east and west; and in the earths from the east towards the west dwell those who are in the good of love; but the river signifies the first boundary, and the ends of the earth [signify] the last [boundaries] from south to north, where those dwell who are in truths from good, which boundaries also the rivers Jordan and Euphrates respectively represented to the land of Canaan. The places that are about the ultimate boundaries, are meant by islands, by which, therefore, are signified truths in ultimates; these, although they are not truths are still accepted as truths. For genuine truths are diminished from the centre towards the boundaries, because those who are around the boundaries are in natural light, and thus not in spiritual light. By enemies are signified evils, concerning whom it is said that they shall lick the dust, that is, that they are accursed.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>"Jehovah reigneth; the earth shall rejoice; many isles shall be glad" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_97_1.htm">Psalms 97:1</a>).<p>By these words is signified that the church where the Word is and the church where the Word is not, consequently, those who are in spiritual truths and those who are not in spiritual truths, shall rejoice on account of the Lord's kingdom. By the earth is signified the church where the Word is, and by the islands [the church] where the Word is not, consequently, those who are remote from spiritual truths; for the truths of the Word are alone spiritual, whereas with those who are outside the church, because they have not the truths of the Word, there are only natural truths; hence it is that they are called islands.</p><p>[18] By islands in the Word are not meant some islands of the sea, but places in the spiritual world inhabited by those who are in a natural knowledge of cognitions (scientia cognitionum) in some degree harmonising with the knowledges of truth and good in the Word; these places sometimes appear there as islands in the sea; whence, in an abstract sense, by islands are signified the truths of the natural man. This denomination is from the sea, in which there are islands, for the sea signifies the generals of truth, or the truths of the natural man in general. These things are signified by islands in Genesis:<p>"The sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim. From these were the isles of the nations dispersed in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_4.htm">10:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_5.htm">5</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"He shall come to gather all nations and tongues, that they may come and see my glory. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">66:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_19.htm">19</a>; likewise <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_10.htm">Isaiah 11:10-12</a>).</p><p>[19] Because most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so also have islands; in which sense islands signify the falsities opposed to the truths which are in the natural man. In this sense islands are mentioned in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah<p>"I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_15.htm">42:15</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the preceding article.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"I will send a fire on Magog, and among the careless inhabitants of the isles" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_6.htm">39:6</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Anger to his adversaries, retribution to his enemies; to the islands he will retaliate retribution" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_18.htm">59:18</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as one of the least of things" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_15.htm">40:15</a>).<p>The nations here mean evils, and the isles falsities.<p>In the same:<p>"Keep silence, O islands; let the people renew their strength; let them come near, then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment. The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_1.htm">41:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_5.htm">5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 406</h4><p>406. Thus far it has been shown what "mountain" signifies; it remains to be shown what "island" signifies, for it is said, "Every mountain and island were moved out of their places;" and elsewhere:<p>Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_20.htm">Revelation 16:20</a>).<p>"Islands" in the Word do not mean islands nor those who dwell upon islands, but the natural man in respect to the truths that are in it is meant, and thus, in an abstract sense, the truths of the natural man are signified. The truths of the natural man are true knowledges [scientifica], which are under the intuition of the rational man, and the cognitions of truth which are under the intuition of the spiritual man; the cognitions of truth are such as the natural man knows from the Word, while true knowledges [scientifica] are such as the natural man sees from the rational, and by which he is accustomed to confirm the truths of the church. There are with man two minds, one higher or interior, which is called the spiritual mind; and the other lower or exterior, which is called the natural mind. The natural mind is first opened and cultivated with men, because this most nearly stands forth in the world; and afterwards the spiritual mind is opened and cultivated, but only to the extent that man receives in the life the cognitions of truth from the Word, or from doctrine from the Word; consequently with those who do not apply knowledges to the life it is not opened. But when the spiritual mind is opened the light of heaven flows in through that mind into the natural mind and enlightens it, whereby the natural mind becomes spiritual-natural; for the spiritual mind then sees in the natural almost as a man sees his face in a mirror, and acknowledges the things that are in agreement with itself. But when the spiritual mind is not opened, as is the case with those who do not apply to their life the cognitions of truth and good that are in the Word, there is nevertheless formed in man a mind in the interior part of the natural; but this mind consists of mere falsities and evils; because the spiritual mind, by which the light of heaven is let into the natural by a direct way is not opened; but [light is let in] only through chinks round about; from this a man has the faculty to think, reason, and speak, and also the faculty to understand truths, but not the faculty to love them, or to do them from affection. For the faculty to love truths because they are truths is given only through an influx of the light of heaven through the spiritual mind; for the light of heaven through the spiritual mind is conjoined with the heat of heaven, which is love, which is comparatively like the light of the world in the time of spring; but the light of heaven flowing only through chinks into the natural is a light separated from the heat of heaven which is love, and this light is comparatively like the light of the world in the time of winter. This makes clear that a man in whom the spiritual mind is opened is like a garden and a paradise; but a man in whom the spiritual mind is not opened is like a wilderness, and like land covered with snow. Because the mind makes the man (the mind consisting of understanding and will) it is the same whether you say the mind or the man, thus whether you say the spiritual and natural mind or the spiritual and natural man.<p>The natural mind or natural man, in respect to its truths and its falsities, is signified by "islands" in the Word, in respect to truths with those in whom the spiritual mind is opened, and in respect to falsities with those in whom the spiritual mind is closed.</p><p>[2] That these are signified by "islands" can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Ezekiel:<p>Thus said the Lord Jehovih to Tyre: Shall not the islands quake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded shall groan, when the slaughter shall be accomplished in the midst of thee? And all the princes of the sea shall come down from <sup>1</sup>their thrones. The islands shall tremble in the day of thy fall, and the islands that are in the sea shall be affrighted at thy departure. All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished at thee, and their kings shuddered shuddering, their faces were troubled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15-16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_26_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_35.htm">27:35</a>).<p>These two chapters treat of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and in an abstract sense the knowledges of truth and good. In the first place the intelligence and wisdom of the men of the church through the knowledges of truth and good from the Word is treated of, and afterwards the church vastated in respect to these. The church vastated in respect to these, or where the knowledges of truth and good have perished is described by what is said by the prophet in these verses; the vastation of the knowledges of truth and good by "when the wounded shall groan, and when the slaughter shall be accomplished in the midst of thee," "the wounded" meaning those in whom truths are extinguished, and "slaughter" meaning the very extinction of truth and good.<p>That all knowledges that man from his infancy has imbibed from the Word, also all true knowledges by which he has confirmed them, are then disturbed, moved out of their place, and recede is signified by "the islands shall tremble, and all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones," also by "the islands shall tremble in the day of thy fall, and the islands that are in the sea shall be affrighted," "islands" meaning these cognitions and knowledges in the natural man; "the princes of the sea" primary things therein, "sea" signifying the natural man and all things therein in general. That all goods of truth of the natural man, because of the vastation of the knowledges of truth, shall be changed as to their state is signified by "all the inhabitants of the islands were astonished at thee, and their kings shuddered, their faces were troubled;" "the inhabitants of the islands" mean the goods of truth of the natural man, for "to inhabit," in the Word, signifies to live, and "inhabitants" the goods of life; "kings" mean all truths from good; "faces" signify the interiors and the affections; "to be astonished," "affrighted," and "troubled" signify to be entirely changed as to state. This makes clear what these things involve in the internal sense, namely, that all cognitions of truth and good and the confirming knowledges that man from infancy has imbibed from the Word and from teachers, will change their places and their state in the natural man and perish out of sight when falsities enter.</p><p>[3] In Isaiah:<p>The king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away; then shall they be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their expectation, and because of Egypt their adornment; and the inhabitant of this island shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from before the king of Assyria; and how shall we escape? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_4.htm">Isaiah 20:4-6</a>).<p>No one can perceive anything about the church in these words, but only something obscurely historical, which is not known to have occurred, as that the king of Assyria will lead away Egypt and Cush into captivity, and that the dwellers of some island would grieve in heart over it; yet, here as elsewhere, some matter of the church is treated of, and this matter becomes manifest when it is known that "the king of Assyria" signifies the rational perverted, and thence the reasoning from false knowledges which favor the delight of natural loves, over which the natural man grieves because it is perverted thereby; for "the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away" signifies that the perverted rational will claim to itself the knowledges of the natural man, and will confirm itself by these and by its delights, which these favor, "the king of Assyria" meaning the rational perverted, "to lead the captivity" and "to carry away the crowd" meaning to claim for itself and to confirm itself by reasonings, "Egypt" meaning the knowing faculty of the natural man, and "Cush" the delight which it favors.<p>That the goods of truth of the natural man grieve on this account, or that the natural man, in which are the goods of truth, grieves is signified by all the things that follow, namely, that "they shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their expectation, and because of Egypt their adornment; and the inhabitant of the island shall say in that day," and what follows; "the inhabitant of the island" meaning the good of truth, of the natural man, or the natural man in whom is the good of truth, "inhabitant" signifying good, and "island" truth, both in the natural man (as above). That there is such a sense in these words can hardly be believed, and yet it is there.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for joy; for the majesty of Jehovah they shall cry aloud from the sea; therefore glorify Jehovah in Urim, the name of [Jehovah] the God of Israel in the islands of the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_14.htm">Isaiah 24:14-15</a>).<p>This chapter treats of the vastation of the church, and in these verses of the establishment of a new church among the gentiles; the joy of these is described by "they shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for joy; for the majesty of Jehovah they shall cry aloud from the sea," or from the west; "the sea" when it means the west signifying the natural, for the reason that those who dwell in the western quarter in the spiritual world are in natural good, while those who dwell in the eastern quarter are in celestial good; and as the Gentiles of whom the church was constituted were in natural good it is said "glorify Jehovah in Urim, the name of the God of Israel in the islands of the sea," which signifies that they were to worship the Lord from the goods and truths in the natural man, for "Urim" means a fire and a hearth, and these signify the good of love of the natural man; "the islands of the sea" signify the knowledges of truth and good, which are the truths of the natural man; and "to glorify" signifies to worship and adore; "Jehovah" and "God of Israel" mean the Lord, who is called "Jehovah" where good is treated of, and "the God of Israel" where truth is treated of; it is therefore said "glorify Jehovah in Urim," that is, from good, "and the name of the God of Israel in the islands of the sea," that is, from truths. This makes clear that "islands of the sea" signify the truths of the natural man.</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>He shall not quench nor break till He have set judgment in the earth; and the islands shall hope in His law. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, His praise, the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, its fullness, ye islands and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and its cities extol, the villages that Arabia doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the cliff sing aloud, let them cry aloud from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare His praise in the islands (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>, where this is explained; "let them give glory unto Jehovah, and let the islands declare His praise," signifies worship from internals and externals; "to give glory" meaning worship from internals, and "to declare praise" worship from externals, for externals declare, and "islands" mean the truths of the natural man from which is worship.</p><p>[6] In the same:<p>Attend unto Me, My people, and give ears unto Me, O My nation; for the law shall go forth from Me, and I will arouse My judgment for a light of the peoples. My righteousness is near, My salvation is gone forth, and Mine arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall hope in Me, and on Mine arm shall they trust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_4.htm">Isaiah 51:4-5</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord; "Attend unto Me, My people, and give ears unto Me, O My nation," signifies all who are of the church who are in truths and goods, "people" meaning those who are in truths and "nation" those who are in goods. It is said "attend" and "give ears," in the plural, because all are meant; "the law shall go forth from Me, and I will arouse My judgment for a light of the peoples," signifies that from Him are Divine good and Divine truth, from which is illustration; "law" signifying the Divine good of the Word, and "judgment" the Divine truth of the Word, "for a light of the people" signifying illustration; "My righteousness is near, My salvation is gone forth," signifies the judgment, when those who are in the good of love and in truths therefrom are saved, "righteousness" having reference to the salvation of those who are in good at the day of judgment, and "salvation" of those who are in truths; "Mine arms shall judge the peoples" signifies judgment upon those of the church who are in falsities, "peoples" here having the contrary sense; "the islands shall hope in Me, and on Mine arm shall they trust," signifies the approach of those to the church who are remote from the truths of the church, and their trust in the Lord; "the islands" signifying those who are remote from the truths of the church because they are in natural light and not yet in spiritual light from the Word, and "to trust on His arm" signifies trust in the Lord who has all power, "arm" in reference to the Lord meaning omnipotence.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>Hear, O islands, and attend ye peoples from afar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>).<p>"The islands" stand for those who are in truths, and "the peoples from afar" for those who are in goods, and in an abstract sense, truths and goods, both in the natural man; "from afar" is predicated of the goods that are in the natural man, while "near" is predicated of the goods that are in the spiritual man. "Peoples" here signify goods, because in the original a different word is used from that which signifies truths; for this word is also applied to nations, whereby goods are signified (as is evident from the same word in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_25_23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye nations, and declare it in the islands afar off (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8918.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8918</a>). But these words in a purely spiritual sense, signify that the internal man shall teach the external, or the spiritual the whole natural man, the truths of the Word, for it is this that "the nations declare in the islands afar off;" but this pure sense, which is for angels, is with difficulty perceived by men, for it is with difficulty that men can think abstractedly from persons and places, for the reason that the thought of men is natural, and natural thought differs from spiritual thought in this, that it is tied down to places and persons and is consequently more limited than the spiritual. And this is why many things that have been explained will perhaps with difficulty fall into the ideas of the thought of those who keep the sight of the mind fixed on the sense of the words.</p><p>[9] In David:<p>The kings of Tarshish and of the islands shall bring an offering; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer a gift (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1171.htm">1171</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3240.htm">3240</a>; and that the interior truths of the natural man are meant by "Tarshish," see just below.) And because these are meant, those who are in the knowledges of truth and good are also meant.</p><p>[10] In Isaiah:<p>Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as doves to their windows? Because the islands shall trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring thy sons from far (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1977.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1977</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6385.htm">6385</a>; and that "windows" signify truths in light, and therefore the intellectual, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/655.htm">655</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/658.htm">658</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3391.htm">3391</a>)</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house, nor doth anyone enter; from the land of Kittim it shall plainly come to them. The inhabitants of the island are still, the merchant of Zidon passeth over the sea, they have filled thee. Be ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea saith, the stronghold of the sea, I have not travailed, neither brought forth; I have not trained up young men, I have not brought up virgins. When the report comes from Egypt they shall be in travail, as at the report respecting Tyre. Pass ye over into Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the island (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_23_4.htm">4-6</a>).<p>This describes the desolation of truth in the church; for "the ships of Tarshish" signify the knowledges of good from the Word, and "Tyre" the knowledges of truth therefrom. That there is no good because there are no truths is signified by "howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house, nor doth anyone enter," that falsities then enter until there are no longer any goods of truth and truths of good in the natural man, is signified by "from the land of Kittim it shall plainly come to them; the inhabitants of the island are still, the merchant of Zidon passeth over the sea, they have filled thee;" "the land of Kittim" signifies falsities; "the inhabitants of the island" signify the goods of truth in the natural man (as above); "the merchant of Zidon" signifies the knowledges from the Word; "passeth over the sea" signifies which are in the natural man; "they have filled thee" (that is, the ships of Tarshish) signifies, they have enriched thee by them. The vastation of truth and good in the natural man is further described by "Be ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea said, the stronghold of the sea, I have not travailed, neither brought forth; I have not trained up young men, I have not brought up virgins;" "Zidon," as well as "Tyre," signifies the knowledges of truth and good in the church; "the sea, the stronghold of the sea," signifies the whole natural man; "I have not travailed, neither brought forth," signifies that there is nothing of the church conceived or generated; "young men" signify the affections of truth, and "virgins" the affections of good. This took place because cognitions from the Word and confirming knowledges [scientifica] were applied to falsities and evils which is signified by "when the report comes from Egypt they shall be in travail, as at the report respecting Tyre;" "Egypt" signifying knowledges [scientifica]; "Tyre," the cognitions from the Word, here those vastated by the falsities and evils to which they have been applied; and as there is lamentation on this account it is said "they shall be in travail." That all good in the natural man and all truth there would thus perish is signified by "pass ye over into Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the island;" "Tarshish" signifying interior goods and truths in the natural man; "the inhabitants of the island" signifying exterior goods and truths therein (as above), "to howl" signifying grief on account of vastation.</p><p>[12] In Jeremiah:<p>I took the cup out of Jehovah's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah sent me, all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the island which is in the crossing (beyond) the sea (<a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>). The vastation of these things is meant by "the cup of Jehovah which the prophet made the nations to drink."</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>Because of the day that cometh to devastate all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every residue that helpeth; for Jehovah devastates the Philistines, the remnant of the island of Caphtor (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2049.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2049</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3413.htm">3413</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8093.htm">8093</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8313.htm">8313</a>); "to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every residue that helpeth" signifies that they have no knowledge of truth and good; "the residue that helpeth" signifying that they are no longer concordant; "the remnant of the island of Caphtor" has a like signification.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>Pass over into the islands of the Kittim and see; send into Arabia and consider well, and see whether there hath been such a thing, whether a nation hath changed gods (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10-11</a>).<p>"To pass over and to send into the islands of the Kittim and into Arabia" does not signify to send to those places, but to all who live naturally in truths and goods according to their religious principle; "the islands of the Kittim" meaning where those are who live naturally in truths, and "Arabia" where those are who live naturally in goods, that is, according to their religious principle; "the Kittim" and "Arabia" signify such persons and things; for all who do not have the Word or any revelation from heaven, and live according to their religious principle, live naturally; for to live spiritually is to live solely in accordance with truths and goods from the Word and from revelation out of heaven.</p><p>[15] In Zephaniah:<p>Jehovah will be fearful upon them; for He will make lean all the gods of the earth, <sup>2</sup>that they may worship Him, every man from his place, all the islands of the nations, ye Kushites also, slain by my sword shall they be (<a href="../njhd/21.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 21</a>.)</p><p>[16] In David:<p>He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river even unto the uttermost parts of the earth. The islands shall bow low before Him; and His enemies shall lick the dust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_72_8.htm">Psalms 72:8-9</a>).<p>This is said respecting the Lord; and "to have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river even unto the uttermost parts of the earth," means His dominion over all things of heaven and the church; for the boundaries in the spiritual world are seas, and the intermediate regions are lands, where there are habitations for angels and spirits; therefore "from sea to sea" signifies all things of heaven, and because all things of heaven, it signifies also all things of the church; for the goods of love and the truths therefrom are what constitute both heaven and also the church, so "from sea to sea" signifies also all things of the church.<p>All things of heaven and of the church are signified by "from the river even unto the uttermost parts of the earth;" but this signifies all things of heaven and of the church in respect to truths, while "from sea to sea" signifies all things of heaven and of the church in respect to goods; for in the spiritual world the seas are the boundaries of the land east and west, and in the lands from the east to the west those dwell who are in the good of love; while "the river" means the first boundary, and "the uttermost parts of the earth" the last boundaries from south to north, where those dwell who are in truths from good; these boundaries were represented in respect to the land of Canaan by the rivers Jordan and Euphrates. Because the places that are about the last boundaries are meant by "islands," these signify truths in last things; and these, although they are not truths, are accepted as truths; for genuine truths are diminished from the midst towards the borders, since those who are about the borders are in natural light, and not so much in spiritual light. "Enemies" signify evils, of whom it is said that they "shall lick the dust," that is, that they are damned.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>Jehovah reigneth; the earth shall exult; many islands shall be glad (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_97_1.htm">Psalms 97:1</a>).<p>This signifies that the church where the Word is and the church where the Word is not, consequently those who are in spiritual truths and those who are in truths not spiritual, shall rejoice on account of the Lord's kingdom. "The earth" signifies the church where the Word is, and "the islands" the church where the Word is not, consequently those who are far away from spiritual truths; for the truths of the Word only are spiritual, whereas those who are outside the church, as they do not have the truths of the Word, have only natural truths; this is why they are called "islands."</p><p>[18] By "islands" in the Word certain islands of the sea are not meant, but places in the spiritual world inhabited by those who have a natural knowledge of cognitions that in some measure agree with the cognitions of truth and good that are in the Word; and these places sometimes appear there as islands in a sea; so in an abstract sense "islands" signify the truths of the natural man. This is so called from a sea in which there are islands, for "the sea" signifies the generals of truth, or the truths of the natural man in general. This is the signification of "islands" in Genesis:<p>The sons of Javan were Elisha and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From these were the islands of the nations separated in their lands; everyone after his tongue, after their families, in their nations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_4.htm">Genesis 10:4-5</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>He will come to gather all nations and tongues that they may come and see My glory; and I will set a sign among them, and I will send those of them that escape unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the islands afar off, that have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">Isaiah 66:18-19</a>; likewise <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_10.htm">Isaiah 11:10-11</a>).</p><p>[19] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so have islands; and in this sense "islands" signify the falsities opposed to the truths in the natural man. In this sense "islands" are mentioned in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>I will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_15.htm">Isaiah 42:15-16</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the preceding article, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_39_6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>[He will repay] wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies; to the islands He will repay retribution (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>).<p>Behold, the nations are as a drop from a bucket, and are reckoned as the dust of the balance; behold, He taketh up the islands as a very little thing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_15.htm">Isaiah 40:15</a>).<p>"Nations" here stand for evils, and "the islands" for falsities. In the same:<p>Keep silence, O islands; let the peoples renew power; let them draw near, then let them speak; let us come near together for judgment. The islands saw and feared; the ends of the earth trembled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_5.htm">5</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "upon their thrones;" the Hebrew "from their thrones," as is also given in the following explanation.<br><br>2.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "of the nations;" Hebrew "of the earth," as also found in <a href="../ae/50.htm">AE 50</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1158.htm">AC 1158</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 406 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>406. Hactenus ostensum est quid significat "mons"; sequitur ut ostendatur quid significat "insula", nam dicitur, "Omnis mons et insula e locis suis emota sunt"; et alibi,<p>"Omnis insula fugit, et montes non inventi sunt" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_406/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_20" target=_top>Apocalypsis 16:20</a>).<p>Per "insulas" in Verbo non intelliguntur insulae, nec illi qui habitant super insulis, sed intelligitur naturalis homo quoad vera quae in illo, et inde abstracte significantur vera naturalis hominis. Vera naturalis hominis sunt vera scientifica, quae sub intuitione rationalis hominis sunt, et sunt cognitiones veri, quae sub intuitione spiritualis hominis sunt; cognitiones veri sunt quae scit naturalis homo ex Verbo, et vera scientifica sunt quae videt naturalis homo ex rationali, per quae etiam solet confirmare vera ecclesiae. Sunt apud hominem binae mentes; una superior seu interior, quae mens spiritualis vocatur, et altera inferior seu exterior, quae mens naturalis vocatur. Mens naturalis primum apud homines aperitur et excolitur, quia haec proxime exstat mundo; mens autem Spiritualis postea aperitur et excolitur, sed quantum homo vita recipit cognitiones veri quae ex Verbo seu ex doctrina e Verbo; quare non aperitur apud illos qui non applicant illas vitae. Et cum aperitur mens spiritualis, tunc influit lux caeli per illam mentem in naturalem et illustrat eam, ex quo haec mens fit spiritualis naturalis; nam tunc videt mens spiritualis in naturali paene sicut homo faciem suam in speculo, et agnoscit illa quae concordant secum. At cum spiritualis mens non aperta est, ut fit apud illos qui non vitae suae applicant cognitiones veri et boni quae in Verbo, tunc formatur usque mens apud illum interius in naturali, sed haec mens consistit ex meris falsis et malis, ex causa quia mens spiritualis non aperta est, per quam lux caeli immittitur in naturale per viam rectam, sed solum per rimas circumcirca; unde ei facultas cogitandi, ratiocinandi et loquendi, et quoque facultas intelligendi vera, sed usque non facultas amandi illa, seu ex affectione faciendi illa; nam facultas amandi vera quia vera sunt datur solum per influxum lucis caeli per spiritualem mentem: lux enim caeli per spiritualem mentem conjuncta est cum calore caeli, qui est amor, qualis est comparative lux mundi tempore veris; at lux caeli influens per rimas in naturale, est lux separata a calore caeli, qui est amor, qualis est comparative lux mundi tempore hiemis. Inde patere potest quod homo, apud quem spiritualis mens aperta est, sit sicut hortus et paradisus; et quod homo, apud quem spiritualis mens non aperta est, sit sicut solitudo, et sicut terra nive obtecta.

et quia falsa non mali sunt in naturali homine, ideo per "insulas gentium" significatur naturalis homo quoad illa, seu quoad illa in naturali homine; haec falsa significantur per "confossos gladio meo."
