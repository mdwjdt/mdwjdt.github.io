<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 200</h4><p>200. And I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. That this signifies that they will be in Divine good and thence in Divine truth, is evident from the signification of I will confess his name, as being that they may be according to the quality of the state of their life; for by confessing, when by the Lord, is meant to grant that they may be; for what the Lord says, or confesses, concerning a man or an angel who is in the good of love and faith, He grants and provides, because all the good of love and faith is from Him. This is why to say, in the Word, when said of the Lord, signifies to instruct, to enlighten and provide (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5361.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5361</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6946.htm">6946</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6951.htm">6951</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7019.htm">7019</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8095.htm">8095</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10234.htm">10234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10290.htm">10290</a>). That by name is meant the quality of the state of the life, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>. It is also evident from the signification of Father, when said by the Lord, as denoting the Divine good which is in Him and from Him, which will be treated of in what follows and from the signification of angels, as denoting Divine truth, which is also from the Lord (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>). It is therefore evident that by I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels, is signified that they will be in Divine good and in Divine truth.</p><p>[2] The reason why by Father, when it is said by the Lord, is meant the Divine good which is in the Lord and from the Lord is, that the Lord called the Divine which was in Him from conception, which was the esse of His life, His Father, to which Divine He united His Human when He was in the world.<p>That the Lord called this His Father is quite evident from the fact that He taught that He himself was one with the Father; as in John,<p>"I and my Father are one" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">10:30</a>).<p>Again:<p>"Believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_38.htm">10:38</a>).<p>Again:<p>"He that seeth me seeth him that sent me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_45.htm">12:45</a>).<p>Again:<p>"If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also; and from henceforth ye have known him, and have seen him. Philip said unto him, Lord, show us the Father. Jesus saith, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-17</a>).<p>Again:<p>"If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_19.htm">8:19</a>).<p>Again:<p>"I am not alone, because the Father is with me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_32.htm">16:32</a>).</p><p>[3] Because the Lord is one with the Father, therefore He also declares<p>That all things of the Father are His, and His things are the Father's (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>);<p>That all things that the Father hath are His (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>);<p>That the Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_3.htm">13:3</a>);<p>Because all things are delivered to Him by the Father, no one knoweth the Son but the Father, nor any the Father except the Son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>); also, that no one hath seen the Father except the Son, who is in the bosom of the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_46.htm">6:46</a>); the Word was with God, and God was the Word, "and the Word was made flesh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>From this latter passage it is also clear that they are one; for it is said, that the Word was with God, and God was the Word. It is plain, too, that the Human of the Lord was God; for it is said, and the Word was made flesh. Since then, all things of the Father are also the Lord's, and since He and the Father are one, therefore the Lord, when He ascended into heaven, said to His disciples,<p>"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>);<p>by which He taught that they should approach Him alone, because He alone can do all things; as He also said to them before,<p>"Without me ye call do nothing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>Hence it is evident how the following words are to be understood:<p>"I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>);<p>that is, that the Father is approached when the Lord is approached.</p><p>[4] Amongst many other reasons why the Lord so often spoke of the Father as another was this, that by Father, in the internal or spiritual sense, is meant the Divine good, and by Son, the Divine truth, each in the Lord and from the Lord; for the Word is written by correspondences, and is thus both for men and angels. The Father therefore is mentioned in order that the Divine good of the Lord may be perceived by the angels, who are in the spiritual sense of the Word; and the Son of God and the Son of man are mentioned, in order that the Divine truth in like manner may be perceived (as is evident from what has been shown in Arcana Coelestia, namely, that Father in the Word signifies good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).<p>"Everyone who shall have confessed me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_8.htm">Luke 12:8</a>).</p><p>[5] Because Father signifies the Divine good, and angels Divine truth, therefore also the Lord says,<p>"When the Son of man shall come in his own glory, that of the Father and of the holy angels" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>).<p>Here the Lord calls His own glory, the glory of the Father and of the angels, for He says, in His own glory, that of the Father and of the holy angels; but in another place He says, in the glory of the Father with the angels; and in another place, in His own glory with the angels; as in Mark:<p>"When he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_38.htm">8:38</a>).<p>And in Matthew:<p>"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">25:31</a>).<p>To what has been said above it must be added by way of appendix, that if it be assumed as doctrine, and acknowledged, that the Lord is one with the Father, and that His Human is Divine from the Divine in Himself, light will be seen in every particular of the Word; for what is assumed as doctrine, and acknowledged from doctrine, is in light when the Word is read. The Lord also, from whom all light proceeds and who has all power, enlightens those who are in this acknowledgment. But, on the other hand, if it be assumed and acknowledged as doctrine that the Divine of the Father is something else than the Divine of the Lord, nothing will be seen in light in the Word, because the man who is in that doctrine turns himself from one Divine to another and from the Divine of the Lord, which he may see, which is effected by thought and faith, to a Divine which he cannot see; for the Lord says:<p>"Ye have never heard the voice of the Father, nor seen his form" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>; and also chap 1. 18);<p>and to believe in and love a Divine which cannot be thought of under any form is impossible. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 200</h4><p>200. And I will confess his name before My father and before His angels, signifies that they will be in Divine good and in Divine truth therefrom. This is evident from the signification of "I will confess his name," as being that things are to be in agreement with the quality of their state of life; for "I will confess," when said by the Lord, means to grant that things may be; for what the Lord says or confesses respecting a man or angel who is in the good of love and faith, He grants and provides, since all the good of love and of faith is from Him. Therefore in the Word, "to speak," when predicated of the Lord, signifies to instruct, to illustrate, and to provide (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5361.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5361</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6946.htm">6946</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6951.htm">6951</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7019.htm">7019</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8095.htm">8095</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10234.htm">10234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10290.htm">10290</a>). That "name" means the quality of the state of life, see above n. <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>. This is evident also from the signification of "Father," when it is said by the Lord, as being the Divine good, which is in the Lord and from Him (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "angels," as being Divine truth, which is also from the Lord (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>. From this it is clear that "I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels," signifies that they will be in Divine good and in Divine truth.</p><p>[2] "Father," when it is said by the Lord, means the Divine good, which is in the Lord and from the Lord, because the Divine, which was in the Lord from conception, and which was the Esse of His life, to which Divine He united His Human when He was in the world; this He called "His Father." That the Divine that was in Him from conception was what the Lord called "Father," can be clearly seen from His teaching that He is one with the Father. As in John:<p>I and the Father are one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>).<p>In the same:<p>He that beholdeth Me beholdeth Him that sent Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>).<p>In the same:<p>If ye had known Me ye would have known My Father also; and from henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him. Philip said unto Him, Lord, show us the Father. Jesus saith, Am I so long time with you, and thou dost not know Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The Father that abideth in Me doeth the works. Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>).<p>In the same:<p>If ye had known Me ye would have known My Father also (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>).<p>In the same:<p>I am not alone, became the Father is with Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_32.htm">John 16:32</a>).</p><p>[3] Because the Lord is one with the Father He also declares:<p>That all things of the Father are His, and His are the Father's (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>);<p>That all things whatsoever that the Father hath are His (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>);<p>That the Father hath given all things into the hands of the Son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_3.htm">13:3</a>);<p>And that all things have been delivered unto Him by the Father; that no one knoweth the Son save the Father, neither doth any one know the Father save the Son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>).<p>That no one hath seen the Father except the Son, who is in the bosom of the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_46.htm">6:46</a>).<p>That the Word was with God, and God was the Word, and the Word became flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>From this last passage also it is clear that they are one, for it is said, "The Word was with God, and God was the Word." It is plain, too, that the Human of the Lord is also God, for it is said, "And the Word became flesh." Because all things of the Father are also the Lord's, and because He and the Father are one, the Lord when He ascended into heaven said to His disciples:<p>All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>);<p>by which He taught that men should approach Him alone, because He alone can do all things; as He also said to them before:<p>Without Me ye can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>This makes clear how these words are to be understood:<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh unto the Father but through Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>);<p>namely, that the Father is approached when the Lord is approached.</p><p>[4] The Lord so often spoke of the Father as another than Himself, for this, among many reasons, that by "Father," in the internal or spiritual sense, is meant the Divine good, and by "Son," the Divine truth, each in the Lord and from the Lord; for the Word is written by correspondences, and is thus as well for men as for angels. The "Father" therefore is mentioned, that the Lord's Divine good may be perceived by the angels who are in the spiritual sense of the Word; and "Son of God" and "Son of man" are mentioned, that the Divine truth may be perceived (as can be seen from what has been shown in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that "Father" in the Word signifies good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).<p>Everyone who shall have confessed Me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_8.htm">Luke 12:8</a>).</p><p>[5] Since "Father" signifies Divine good, and "angels" Divine truth, the Lord also says:<p>When the Son of man shall come in His glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>).<p>Here the Lord calls His glory "the glory of the Father and of the angels," for He says, "in His glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels;" but in another place, "in the glory of the Father with the angels;" and elsewhere, "in His glory with the angels." As in Mark:<p>When He shall come in the glory of His Father with the holy angels (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>).<p>And in Matthew:<p>When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>).<p>It should be added further that if it is accepted as a doctrine and acknowledged, that the Lord is one with the Father, and that His Human is Divine from the Divine in Himself, light will be seen in every particular of the Word; for that which is assumed as doctrine and acknowledged from doctrine is in light when the Word is read; moreover, the Lord, from whom is all light and who has all power, will enlighten those who acknowledge this. But on the other hand, if it is assumed and acknowledged as a doctrine that the Divine of the Father is another Divine than the Lord's, nothing will be seen in light in the Word; since the man who is in that doctrine turns himself from one Divine to the other, and away from the Divine of the Lord which he can see (which is done by thought and faith), to a Divine that he cannot see; for the Lord says:<p>Ye have neither heard the Father's voice at any time, nor seen His form (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>; also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>);<p>and to believe in a Divine and love a Divine that cannot be thought of under any form is impossible. </p>
