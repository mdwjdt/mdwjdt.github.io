<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 119</h4><p>119. And the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and are not. That this signifies vituperation from those who think themselves to be in the knowledges of good and truth because they have the Word, and yet it is not so, is evident from the signification of blasphemy, as being scandalous reproach and vituperation; and from the signification of Jews, as being those who are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; for Judah, in the highest sense of the Word, signifies the Lord as to celestial love, in the internal sense, the celestial kingdom of the Lord, and the Word, and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, which is of the celestial church (as may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6363.htm">6363</a>). It is therefore evident by the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not is signified scandalous reproach and vituperation from those who say that they acknowledge the Lord, and are in His kingdom, and in true doctrine because they have the Word, and yet are not; and, in general, those who say they are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, and nevertheless are in falsities and evils.</p><p>[2] Those who are ignorant of the internal sense of the Word, cannot but suppose that, in the prophetic parts of the Word, by Judah and the Jews are meant Judah and the Jews; but these are not there meant by these names, but all those who are in the true doctrine of the church, thus those who are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; and, in the opposite sense, those who are in false doctrine, thus who adulterate the truths and goods of the Word. That Judah and the Jews are not meant is evident from this consideration alone, that there is an internal sense in all the details of the Word, and also in the names of persons and places. This sense treats solely of the things of heaven and the church, therefore such things are also signified by the names Judah and Israel. And whereas a church was instituted with them in which all things were representative and significative of celestial things, therefore by their names was signified that which essentially constitutes the church, namely, in the highest sense, the Lord Himself; in the internal sense, His Word; and, in the external sense, doctrine from the Word, as said above.<p>It is therefore evident how much those are mistaken who believe, according to the letter, that the Jews are to be brought back into the land of Canaan, and that they are elected and destined for heaven in preference to others; whereas few from that nation are saved, because none are saved but those who believe in the Lord; and he who believes in the Lord in the world, believes in Him after his departure out of the world; but that nation altogether casts Him out from its belief.</p><p>[3] That by Judah is meant the Lord as to His kingdom and as to the Word, may be seen from the prophecy of Israel concerning his sons, which, when it is unfolded by the internal sense, shows what each tribe represented in the church. That the tribe of Judah represented the Lord's kingdom, or the church where the Word is, is quite clear from what is said concerning Judah:<p>"Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet, until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be; who shall bind to the vine the foal of his ass, and to the noble vine the son of his she-ass; whilst he washeth his garment in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_11.htm">11</a>).<p>That the particulars mentioned signify the Lord's kingdom, or the church, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained.</p><p>[4] He who knows that by Judah, in the highest sense, is meant the Lord, and, in the internal sense, His kingdom and Word, and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, also, in an opposite sense, those who deny the Lord and adulterate the Word, may know what is signified by Judah in many other places of the Word; as in these following:<p>"Hear ye, O house of Jacob, called by the name of Israel, and they have gone forth from the waters of Judah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>).<p>The house of Jacob, and Israel, is the church; to go forth from the waters of Judah signifies from doctrine out of the Word, for the church is thence. (That waters denote truths of doctrine from the Word, may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_6.htm">Joel 3:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_20.htm">20</a>).<p>To sell the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians, is to falsify the goods and truths of the church; in that day, denotes when that church is at its end and a new one established among the Gentiles; all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, signifies abundance of truths and goods from the Word, to those who are in the New Church; that these are from the Word is signified by the fountain going forth out of the house of Jehovah. It is therefore clear that by Judah who shall sit to eternity, is not meant Judah, or the Jewish nation, but all those who are in good by means of truths from the Word.</p><p>[5] Similar things are meant by Judah in the following passages:<p>"I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them. Then shall the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land; for great is the day of Jezreel" (<a href="../njhd/248.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>.) From these considerations it is now evident what is signified by "The blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and are not." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 119</h4><p>119. And the blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews and they are not, signifies denunciation by those who think themselves to be in the knowledges of good and truth because they have the Word, and yet they are not. This is evident from the signification of "blasphemy," as being reviling and denunciation; and from the signification of "Jews," as being those who are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; for "Judah," in the highest sense of the Word, signifies the Lord in respect to celestial love, in the internal sense the Lord's celestial kingdom and the Word, and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, which is of the celestial church (See Arcana Coelestia, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">3881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6363.htm">6363</a>). From this it can be seen that by the "blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews and they are not," is signified reviling and denunciation by those who say that they acknowledge the Lord, and are in His kingdom and in true doctrine, because they have the Word, and yet they are not; in general, those who say that they are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, and yet are in falsities and evils.</p><p>[2] Those who know nothing of the internal sense of the Word cannot know otherwise than that by "Judah" and "Jews," in the prophetical parts of the word, are meant Judah and the Jews; these, however are not there meant by their names, but all who are in the true doctrine of the church, thus who are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; and in the contrary sense, those who are in false doctrine, thus who have adulterated the truths and goods of the Word. That Judah and the Jews are not meant can be seen merely from this, that there is an internal sense in every particular of the Word, and also in the names of persons and places; and that nothing is treated of in this sense except what pertains to heaven and the church; such things, therefore, must also be signified by the names "Judah" and "Israel." And as with them a church was instituted in which all things were representative and significative of things heavenly, so by their names was signified that which essentially makes the church, namely, in the highest sense, the Lord Himself; in the internal sense His Word; and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, as was said above. From this it is clear how greatly those are mistaken who believe, according to the letter, that the Jews are to be brought back into the land of Canaan, and that they have been chosen and destined for heaven in preference to others; when yet but few from that nation are saved, since none are saved except those who believe in the Lord; and he who believes in the Lord in the world, believes in Him after death; but that nation has altogether rejected Him from its faith.</p><p>[3] That by "Judah" is meant the Lord in respect to His kingdom and the Word can be seen from the prophecy of Israel regarding his sons; when this is unfolded by the internal sense it is clear what each tribe represented in the church. It is clearly evident that the tribe of Judah represented the Lord's kingdom, or the church where the Word is; for it is said of Judah:<p>Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and upon Him shall the clinging of the people be; who shall bind to the vine the foal of His ass, and to the noble vine the son of His she-ass; whilst He shall have washed His garment in wine, and His vesture in the blood of grapes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_9.htm">Genesis 49:9-11</a>).<p>That these particulars signify the Lord's kingdom or the church, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained.</p><p>[4] He who knows that by "Judah" is meant in the highest sense the Lord, and in the internal sense His kingdom and the Word, and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, also in a contrary sense those who deny the Lord and adulterate the Word, can know what is signified by "Judah" in very many passages of the Word, as in the following:<p>Hear ye, O house of Jacob, called by the name of Israel, and who are come forth out of the waters of Judah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>).<p>The "house of Jacob" and "Israel" is the church; "to come forth out of the waters of Judah" signifies out of doctrine from the Word, for the church is from that. That "waters" denote the truths of doctrine out of the Word, see above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_6.htm">Joel 3:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_20.htm">20</a>).<p>"To sell the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians" is to falsify the goods and truths of the church; "in that day" means when there is an end of that church and a new church has been established among the Gentiles; "all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters" signifies the abundance of truth and good from the Word, for those who are in the new church; that these are from the Word is signified by the "fountain going forth out of the house of Jehovah." From this it is evident that by "Judah," who "shall sit to eternity," is not meant Judah or the Jewish nation, but all those who are in good by means of truths from the Word.</p><p>[5] Like things are meant by "Judah" in the following passages:<p>I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them. And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall put over themselves one head, and they shall go up from the land; for great is the day of Jehovah <sup>1</sup>(<a href="../njhd/248.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>). From this now can be seen what is signified by the "blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews, and they are not."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In Hebrew "Jezreel," instead of "Jehovah"; in <a href="../lord/4.htm">Doctrine of the Lord 4</a>, we have "Israel," cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3580.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3580</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 119 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>119. "Et blasphemiam dicentium Judaeos esse se et non sunt." - Quod significet invectionem ab illis qui putant se in cognitionibus boni et veri esse, quia habent Verbum, et tamen non sunt, constat ex significatione "blasphemiae", quod sit vituperatio et invectio; et ex significatione "judaeorum", quod sint qui in cognitionibus boni et veri ex Verbo sunt, nam "Judah" in Verbi sensu supremo significat Dominum quoad amorem caelestem, in sensu interno regnum caeleste Domini et Verbum, et in sensu externo doctrinam e Verbo quae ecclesiae caelestis (videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3881" target=_top>3881</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6363" target=_top>6363</a>): inde constare potest quod per "blasphemiam dicentium se Judaeos esse et non sunt", significetur vituperatio et invectio ab illis qui dicunt se agnoscere Dominum, et esse in regno Ipsius, inque vera doctrina, quia habent Verbum, et non tamen sunt; in genere, qui dicunt se in cognitionibus boni et veri esse ex Verbo, et tamen in falsis et malis sunt.<p>[2] Qui nihil de sensu interno Verbi norunt, non aliter scire possunt quam quod in propheticis Verbi per "Jehudam" et "Judaeos"' intelligantur Jehudah et Judaei; ast per nomina eorum ibi non illi intelliguntur, sed omnes qui in vera doctrina ecclesiae sunt, ita qui in cognitionibus boni et veri ex Verbo, et in opposito sensu illi qui in falsa doctrina sunt, ita qui vera et bona Verbi adulteraverunt. Quod non Jehudah et Judaei sint intellecti, constare solum potest ex eo, quod sensus internus sit in singulis Verbi, et quoque in nominibus personarum et locorum, et quod in illo sensu non agatur nisi de rebus caeli et ecclesiae, inde quoque per nomina "Jehudae" et "Israelis"; et quia apud illos instituta fuit ecclesia in qua repraesentativa et significativa caelestium fuerunt omnia, ideo per nomina eorum significatum est id quod essentialiter facit ecclesiam, nempe in supremo sensu Ipse Dominus, et in interno Verbum Ipsius, ac in externo doctrina ex Verbo, ut supra dictum est. Inde patet quantum hallucinantur qui Secundum litteram credunt quod Judaei reducendi sint in Terram Canaanem, et quod illi electi et destinati sint ad caelum prae aliis; cum tamen pauci ex illa gente salvantur, quoniam non alii salvantur quam qui credunt in Dominum; et qui credit in Dominum in mundo, is credit in Ipsum post obitum; et illa gens prorsus a sua fide rejecit Ipsum.<p>[3] Quod per "Jehudam" intelligatur Dominus quoad regnum suum et quoad Verbum, constare potest a prophetico Israelis de filiis suis, quod cum evolvitur per sensum internum patet quid unaquaevis tribus in ecclesia repraesentavit. Quod tribus Jehudae repraesentaverit regnum Domini seu ecclesiam ubi Verbum, constat manifeste; nam de Jehudah dicitur,<p>"Catulus leonis Jehudah, a praeda ascendisti, fili mi:... non recedet sceptrum de Jehudah, nec legislator ab inter pedes ejus, usque dum Venit Schilo, et Huic adhaesio populorum; qui ligabit ad vitem pullum asininum suum, et ad vitem nobilem filium asinae suae; dum laverit in vino vestimentum suum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_11" target=_top>Genesis 49:11</a>):<p>quod singula haec significent regnum Domini seu ecclesiam, videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus, ubi illa explicantur.<p>[4] Qui scit quod per "Jehudam" intelligatur in supremo sensu Dominus, et in interno regnum Ipsius ac Verbum, ac in externo doctrina e Verbo, ac in opposito sensu illi qui negant Dominum et adulterant Verbum, scire potest quid per "Jehudam" plurimis in locis in Verbo significatur ut in sequentibus his: <p>"Audite domus Jacobi, vocati nomine Israelis, et ex aquis Jehudae exiverunt" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_48_1" target=_top>Esaias 48:1</a>);<p>"domus Jacobi" et "Israelis" est ecclesia; "ex aquis Jehudae exire" est ex doctrina e Verbo, ecclesia enim inde est; quod "aquae" sint vera doctrinae ex Verbo, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_71" target=_top>71</a>).<p>"Filios Jehudae et filios Hierosolymae Vendidistis filiis Graecorum, ut longe removeatis eos a terminis eorum... Fiet in die omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis, et fons e domo Jehovae exibit, ... et Jehudah in aeternum sedebit" ((Joel 4)<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_6" target=_top>3:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_20" target=_top>20</a>):<p>"vendere filios Jehudae et filios Hierosolymae filiis Graecorum", est falsificare bona et vera ecclesiae; "in die illo", est quando finis illius ecclesiae est, et nova apud gentes instaurata; "omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis", significant abundantiam veri et boni ex Verbo illis qui in Nova Ecclesia; quod ex Verbo, significatur per quod "fons e domo Jehovae exibit." Inde patet quod per "Jehudam" qui "In aeternum sedebit", non intelligatur Jehudah seu Judaica gens, sed omnes illi qui in bono per vera ex Verbo sunt.<p>[5] Similia intelliguntur per "Jehudam" in sequentibus his locis: -<p>"Domus Jehudae miserebor, et salvabo illos et congregabuntur filii Jehudae et filii Israelis una, et ponent sibi caput unum, et ascendent e terra, quia magnus dies "Israelis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_1_7" target=_top>Hoschea 1:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_1_11" target=_top>11</a>);<p>"Tunc adhaerebunt gentes multae Jehovae in die illo; erunt Mihi in populum; habitabo namque in te:... tunc Jehovah hereditatem Sibi faciet Jehudam, portionem suam super terra sanctitatis, et eliget iterum Hierosolymam" (Sacharia 2:15, 16 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_2_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_2_12" target=_top>12</a>]);<p>"Visitabit Jehovah Zebaoth gregem suum, domum Jehudae, et ponet eos (sicut) equum gloriae in bello;... potentem reddam domum Jehudae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_10_3" target=_top>Sacharia 10:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_10_6" target=_top>6</a>);<p>"Deus salvabit Zionem, et aedificabit urbes Jehudae et habitabunt ibi, et hereditabunt eam, et semen servorum Illius hereditabunt eam; et amantes nomen Jehovae habitabunt in ea" (Psalms 69:36, 37 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_69_35" target=_top>35</a> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_69_36" target=_top>36</a>]);<p>"Producam ex Jacobo semen, et ex Jehudah heredem montium meorum, ut possideant eum electi mei" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_65_9" target=_top>Esaias 65:9</a>); praeter in plurimis aliis locis. <p>(Porro quod gens Judaica non intellecta sit in Verbo in illis locis et in aliis ubi vocantur "electi" et "heredes", videri potest ex illis quae de gente illa ex Arcanis Caelestibus allata sunt, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_119/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_248" target=_top>248</a>.) <p>Ex his nunc constare potest quid significatur per "blasphemiam dicentium Judaeos esse se, et non sunt." </p>
