<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 422</h4><p>422. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun. That this signifies the Divine Love going forth from the Lord, is clear from the signification of an angel, as denoting somewhat Divine proceeding from the Lord. For by an angel in the Word in a proximate sense, is meant a whole angelic society, and in a general sense, every one who receives the Divine Truth in doctrine and life; but in the highest sense, by an angel is signified something Divine which proceeds from the Lord, and specifically the Divine Truth. Concerning these significations of an angel see above (n. <a href="../ae/90.htm">90</a>, <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/200.htm">200</a>, <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../ae/307.htm">307</a>). Here, therefore, by the "angel ascending from the rising of the sun" is signified the Divine going forth from the Love of the Lord. The rising of the sun, or the east, signifies the Divine Love of the Lord, and to ascend thence, signifies to go forth, and to proceed; therefore, by the "angel ascending from the rising of the sun"; is signified the Divine Love going forth from the Lord. Those things which follow also are of the Divine Love, lest the good should suffer hurt. The rising of the sun signifies the Divine Love of the Lord, because the Lord in the angelic heaven is the Sun, and the Lord appears as the Sun from His Divine Love. Where the Lord appears as the Sun, there is the east in heaven, and because He is always there, He is also constantly rising.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world there are four quarters, the eastern, western, southern, and northern. They all derive their position from the Sun, which is the Lord; and where the Sun is, there is the east, opposite this is the west, to the right the south, and to the left the north. In the eastern quarter dwell those angels who are in love to the Lord, because they are under the immediate auspices of the Lord, for the Lord flows into them intimately and directly from Divine Love, and therefore the rising of the sun, and the east, in the Word, signify the Divine Love of the Lord. That the Lord in the angelic heaven appears as a Sun, and that it is the Divine Love of the Lord which so appears, may be seen in <a href="../hh/116.htm">Heaven and Hell 116-125</a>); that the sun in the Word therefore signifies the Divine Love, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>). That all the quarters in the spiritual world derive their position from the east, where the Lord is as a Sun, see <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141</a>); and that therefore those dwell in the eastern quarter who are in the good of love to the Lord (n. <a href="../hh/148.htm">148</a>, <a href="../hh/149.htm">149</a>).</p><p>[3] The eastern, western, southern, and northern quarters are frequently mentioned in the Word, and those who are unacquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word believe that they mean the quarters in our solar world, and therefore they do not suppose that they involve arcana of heaven and of the church. But the quarters named in the Word mean the quarters in the spiritual world, which differ altogether from the quarters in our world; for all the angels and spirits dwell there in quarters determined according to the quality of their good and truth; those who are in the good of love to the Lord dwell in the east and the west, and those who are in truths from that good dwell in the south and north.<p>The reason of their dwelling in this manner is that the Lord there is the Sun, and from Him as the Sun all heat and light, or all good and truth proceed. The heat there, which is spiritual heat, or the good of love, flows directly from the east into the west, and decreases according to reception by the angels, and therefore according to distances, for in the spiritual world all distance from the Lord is according to the reception of good and truth from Him. And this is the reason why those dwell in the east who are in the good of love in an interior and consequently clear degree, and in the west those who are in an exterior and therefore obscure degree of that good. But light, which is spiritual light, or Divine Truth, also flows directly from the east into the west, and likewise flows in on both sides, but with this difference, that the Divine Truth which flows in from east to west is, in its essence, the good of love, while that which flows in laterally is, in its essence, the truth from that good. Those therefore who dwell respectively in the south and in the north, the quarters situated laterally, are in the light of truth, those in the south being in a clear, and those in the north in an obscure light of truth. The light of truth is intelligence and wisdom. But concerning these quarters more may be seen in <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>). These quarters then are meant in the Word, where mention is made of quarters, therefore they also signify such Divine things as exist in those quarters; for the east signifies the good of love in clearness; the west, the good of love in obscurity; the south, truth from that good in clearness; and the north, truth from that good in obscurity.</p><p>[4] Moreover, there are quarters in the spiritual world differing from the quarters just named, and distant from them about thirty degrees, and these are under the auspices of the Lord as a moon; for the Lord appears as a Sun to those who are in love to Him, but as a moon to those who are in charity towards their neighbour, and in faith therefrom. Concerning this appearance, see also <a href="../hh/111.htm">Heaven and Hell 111</a>, <a href="../hh/119.htm">119</a>, <a href="../hh/122.htm">122</a>). In the eastern and western quarters there, dwell those who are in the good of charity towards their neighbour; and in the southern and the northern those who are in truths from that good, called the truths of faith. These quarters also are sometimes meant in the Word, where those truths and goods are the subject treated of.</p><p>[5] It is evident from these facts that he who knows nothing of the quarters of heaven of which we have spoken, cannot possibly know anything of the spiritual things of the Word where those quarters are mentioned, as in the following passage.<p>Thus, in Isaiah:<p>"I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_5.htm">43:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_6.htm">6</a>).<p>Jacob and Israel is here the subject, and unless it be known that the spiritual things explained above are meant by those quarters, it may be supposed that nothing more is implied, than that the sons of Israel and Jacob are to be gathered from all sides. But by Jacob and Israel is meant the church which is from those who are in the good of love and in truths from that good; and by their seed are meant all who are of that church. The bringing and gathering together of those who are in the good of love, is meant by, "I will bring thy seed from the east, and will gather thee from the west"; and the same, with respect to those who are in truths from that good, is meant by, "I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back." That all who are in those truths and goods, even to those who are in the ultimates, shall be brought together, is signified by "bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth." Sons denote those who are in truths, and daughters denote those who are in goods; the words, "from far, and from the end of the earth," signify those who are in the ultimate truths and goods of the church. Similar things are also signified by those quarters in the following passages. Thus, in David:<p>Jehovah will gather the redeemed from the earth, "from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_3.htm">107:3</a>).<p>And in Moses:<p>Jehovah said to Jacob in a dream, "thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_28_14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p>In Luke:<p>"They shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall recline (accumbentes), <sup>1</sup>in the kingdom of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">13:29</a>).</p><p>[6] In very many passages it is said from east to west only, and not at the same time from the south and from the north; in such passages all who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in the good of charity towards the neighbour are meant. These quarters also imply the two others, because all who are in good are also in truths, for good and truth everywhere act as one; these therefore are meant where it is said "from east to west."<p>Again, in Matthew:<p>"Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">8:11</a>).<p>In the passage quoted above from Luke, it is said of those who shall recline in the kingdom of the heavens, "that they shall come from the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south;" but in the passage in Matthew it is simply said the east and the west; the reason of which is that these quarters imply the two others as just stated. Similarly in the following passages.<p>Thus in Malachi:<p>"From the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the gentiles" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_1_11.htm">1:11</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"From the rising of the sun even to his setting, the name of Jehovah is to be praised" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_113_3.htm">Psalm 113:3</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"They shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">59:19</a>).<p>Again, in the same prophet:<p>"That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_6.htm">45:6</a>).<p>Again, in David:<p>"God, God Jehovah speaks, and will call the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a>).<p>And in Zechariah:<p>"Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_7.htm">8:7</a>).<p>In these passages "from the rising and setting" signifies all who are in the goods and truths of heaven and the church. Similar things are signified by the quarters according to which the temple was measured (Ezek. xlii.); also according to which the land was measured for an inheritance (xlvii.); and was distributed among the tribes of Israel (xlviii.); then according to which the Israelites measured the camp (Numb ii.), according to which they journeyed (x.); and according to which the gates of the new city were placed (Ezek. xl.; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_12.htm">Rev. 21:12</a>), besides similar things elsewhere.</p><p>[7] The reason why the temple was measured according to the quarters as in Ezekiel, and the land distributed among the tribes according to the quarters, as mentioned both in Ezekiel and in Joshua, and also the reason why the sons of Israel encamped, and also journeyed, according to the same order, is, that everything in the spiritual world is arranged according to the quarters, not only generally but also particularly. In general, all angels and spirits dwell in the quarters corresponding to their states of good and truth, as said above. The case is the same individually, for in all their assemblies, those who are present take their places in the quarters that correspond to the states of their life; there they sit in the temples, and dwell in their houses in a similar manner. There in a word, all things generally and particularly are arranged according to the quarters of heaven; for the form of heaven is the same in every detail as it is in general. From these considerations it is clear what is signified in the Word by arrangements according to the quarters, also by the quarters according to which the tabernacle was built, and according to which the temple was built by Solomon; besides other similar things.</p><p>[8] So far concerning the quarters generally. That the east signifies the Lord as to Divine Love, and therefore the good of love to the Lord with those who are recipients of it, is plain from the following passages.<p>Thus in Ezekiel:<p>"He brought me to the gate of the temple that looketh toward the east; and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth shone with his glory. The glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate, whose prospect is toward the east. Then the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-5</a>).<p>Here the subject is the building of the new temple which signifies the New Church to be established by the Lord; and because introduction into it is effected by the good of love to the Lord, and by truth from that good, therefore the gate that looketh toward the east, and the God of Israel coming from the way of the east were seen. By the gate is signified introduction and approach; by the God of Israel is meant the Lord; by the east, the good of love from Him and manifested towards Him; and by glory, truth from that good. For the Lord enters into heaven, and thence into the church, from His Divine Love, which, as said above, appears in the heavens as the Sun; thence are all the Divine Good and the Divine Truth there. The glory of Jehovah seen to enter the house by the way of the gate whose prospect was towards the east, and also the glory of Jehovah filling the house, have a similar signification; for the house or temple signifies heaven and the church. By glory in the Word is signified the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord; by "the glory of the God of Israel," the Divine Truth enlightening those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and by "the glory of Jehovah," the Divine Truth enlightening, those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom. The Divine Truth is called glory because it is the light of heaven, and that light is the cause of all splendour, magnificence, and glory in the heavens; for everything that appears before the eyes in the heavens is from that light. So also it is said that "the earth shone with his glory," and by the earth is meant the church. The influx of Divine Truth towards lower things on every side is signified by "his voice was like the voice of many waters," voice signifying influx, and waters, truths.</p><p>[9] Again:<p>"Then he brought me back by the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary that looketh toward the east; and it was shut; but Jehovah the God of Israel will enter in by it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_44_1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_44_2.htm">2</a>).<p>And in the same:<p>"The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six days of labour; but on the day of the sabbath it shall be opened" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_46_1.htm">46:1</a>).<p>By the "gate that looketh toward the east" is also signified introduction into heaven and the church by the Lord by means of the good of love proceeding from Him, which is therefore meant by the east; and that this is from the Lord, is signified by Jehovah the God of Israel entering by that gate. That introduction is the result of the worship of Him from that good, is signified by the words "on the day of the sabbath it shall be opened;" and that introduction does not take place when worship is not from that good, is signified by the gate being shut during the six days of labour.</p><p>[10] Again, in the same prophet:<p>"And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and they stood at the door of the gate [of the house] of Jehovah toward the east; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above" (<a href="../ae/152.htm">152</a>, <a href="../ae/277.htm">277</a>); and because the Lord is signified by cherubim, and from the Lord as the Sun, where the east is, proceed all the good of love, and all truth from that good, therefore the cherubim were seen to stand at the door of the gate of the house of Jehovah towards the east, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. By the house of Jehovah, by the east, and by the glory of the God of Israel, similar things are signified here as above.</p><p>[11] So in Isaiah:<p>"Who raised up one from the east, called him in justice to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings?" (<a href="../ae/357.htm">357:5</a>).</p><p>[12] Thus also in the second book of Samuel,<p>"The spirit of Jehovah spake in me. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me. As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; from the clear shining after rain cometh grass out of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_2.htm">23:2-4</a>).<p>"The God of Israel," and "the Rock of Israel," are the Lord, and because He is the Sun of the angelic heaven, and from Him as the Sun proceeds and flows all the Divine Truth, which enlightens angels and men, imparts intelligence, and reforms, it is said as "the light of the morning when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; through the clear shining after rain cometh grass out of the earth." The light of the morning when the sun riseth, signifies the Divine Truth from the Lord as the Sun; a morning without clouds, denotes its purity, rain its influx, and the grass out of the earth, intelligence, and reformation therefrom; for these are signified by grass because it springs out of the earth by the power of the sun after rain, but intelligence comes from the Lord as the Sun by the influx of Divine Truth.</p><p>[13] Again in Isaiah:<p>"Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the nations shall walk according to thy light, and kings according to the brightness of thy rising" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_2.htm">60:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_3.htm">3</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord. The Divine in Him is meant by "Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." The Divine Good of Divine Love is meant by Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and the Divine Truth from that Good is meant by His glory shall be seen upon thee. The nations signify those who are in good, and kings those who are in truths from good. It is said of the former that "they shall walk according to thy light," which signifies a life according to the Divine Truth; and of the latter, they shall walk "according to the brightness of thy rising," which signifies the life of intelligence from Divine Good; to walk denoting to live; light, the Divine Truth; and the brightness of His rising, the Divine Truth from the Divine Good from which comes intelligence.</p><p>[14] Again in Ezekiel:<p>"The cherubim did lift up their wings; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. And the glory of Jehovah ascended over the midst of the city, and stood over the mountain which is on the east of the city" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_22.htm">11:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_23.htm">23</a>).<p>The cherubim signify the Lord as to Divine Providence and defence, and the glory of the God of Israel signifies the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord as was said above. And because the Divine Truth, which is light, proceeds from the Lord as the Sun in the angelic heaven, therefore the glory of Jehovah was seen to ascend over the midst of the city, and to stand over the mountain which is on the east side of the city. By the city is meant Jerusalem, which signifies the church as to doctrine; and because the doctrine of the church is from the Divine Truth, therefore the glory of Jehovah was seen to ascend over the midst of the city; and since all Divine Truth proceeds from the Lord as the Sun, where the east is, therefore the glory was seen to stand over the mountain on the east of the city. The mountain on the east of the city was the mount of Olives. That the mount of Olives signifies the Divine Love of the Lord, and that therefore the Lord used sometimes to be there, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">Zech. 14:4</a>.</p><p>[15] Again in Ezekiel:<p>"He brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house was toward the east; and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, from the south side of the altar. He brought me out by the way of the gate towards the north, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters from the right side. Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the eastern boundary, and go down into the plain, and come towards the sea; which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed. Whence it comes to pass, that every living soul, which creepeth, whithersoever the rivers come, lives; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish. And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, cometh up every tree for food, whose leaf falleth not, neither is the fruit thereof consumed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">47:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">12</a>).<p>The New Church to be established in the heavens and on the earth by the Lord is here described, when all the Divine will proceed from His Divine Human; for before the coming of the Lord the Divine proceeded from His Divine, which He calls the Father, but this did not extend to ultimates after the church was vastated. By house is here signified the church; by its gate, approach and introduction; by the east, the Lord, where His Divine love appears as the Sun; and by the waters going forth thence is signified the Divine Truth proceeding therefrom. By the plain and the sea are signified the ultimates of the church, or where those are who are in ultimate truths and goods because they are natural and sensual, and who are spiritual only in a slight degree; to these the Divine did not previously extend. Life from the Divine to these also after the coming of the Lord, is signified by the waters of the sea being healed by the inflowing of the river from the east; the very great multitude of fish, signifies abundance of cognitions and scientifics which also become spiritually living with them. The fructification of good and multiplication of truth are signified by every tree for food coming up upon the bank of the river, whose leaf falleth not, neither is the fruit thereof consumed. From this it is evident what the particulars in a series there signify, and that the east, where they all originate, signifies the Lord and His Divine Love.</p><p>[16] The same is signified in Zechariah,<p>"And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; part of them toward the eastern sea" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">14:8</a>).<p>Here also the subject is the Lord. "In that day," signifies His coming, and the eastern sea signifies the ultimate boundary towards the east in the spiritual world, where there was no reception of Divine Truth before the coming of the Lord, but when it proceeded from His Divine Human then there was reception. That the ultimate [boundaries] in the spiritual world are like seas, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>.</p><p>[17] Since the Lord in heaven where the angels are appears as the Sun, and [where He appears] there is the east, therefore when Aaron offered the sin offering for himself and his house, he sprinkled the blood of the bullock on the mercy-seat towards the east (<a href="../hh/17.htm">Heaven and Hell 17</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>, <a href="../hh/142.htm">142</a>, <a href="../hh/143.htm">143</a>, <a href="../hh/144.htm">144</a>, <a href="../hh/272.htm">272</a>).</p><p>[18] Because the Lord is the east, therefore it is said in Matthew,<p>"For as the lightning cometh forth out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_27.htm">24:27</a>).<p>Since, when man is the subject, the rising of the sun signifies the good of love proceeding from the Lord as the Sun, and received by him, it is therefore said in the book of Judges,<p>"So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah; but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_31.htm">5:31</a>).<p>These words occur in the prophetic song of Deborah and Barak; and of those who love Jehovah, that is those who are in the good of love to the Lord, it is said, "as the sun when he goeth forth in his might."</p><p>[19] In Moses:<p>Joseph shall possess "the firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and the precious things of the hills of an age" (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405:31</a>).</p><p>[20] The church existed, in ancient times, in several kingdoms of Asia, as in the land of Canaan, in Syria and Assyria, in Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Chaldea, in Tyre and Sidon, and in other parts; but with those peoples it was a representative church, for in every detail of their worship, and in each of their statutes, spiritual and celestial things, which are the interior things of the church, were represented, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself. These representatives of their worship and statutes remained with many even up to the time of the Lord's coming, and from these they possessed a knowledge of His coming. This is evident from the predictions of Balaam, who was from Syria, and who prophesied concerning the Lord, in these words:<p>"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh; there shall come forth a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>).<p>Then again it is evident from the fact that certain wise men from the east, when the Lord was born, saw a star in the east, and followed it; of this circumstance Matthew thus speaks:<p>"In the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. And, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9</a>).<p>The star was seen in the east by the wise men, because the Lord is the East; and because they knew of the coming of the Lord from those representatives which remained with them, therefore they saw the star and it went before them, first to Jerusalem, which represented the church itself, as to doctrine and the Word, and then to the place where the infant Lord was. A star also signifies the cognitions of good and truth, and in the highest sense, knowledge concerning the Lord. That stars in the Word signify cognitions of good and truth, see above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_28.htm">49:28</a>). By sons of the east in the Word, knowledges of good and truth are also signified; similarly by Kedar or Arabia. That Job was of the sons of the east is evident from chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_1_3.htm">1:3</a>.</p><p>[21] As most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so also has the "east," which, in this sense, signifies the love of self, because this love is the opposite of love to the Lord. In this sense the east is named in Ezekiel (<a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>), and concerning the morning (n. <a href="../ae/176.htm">176</a>); for in the angelic heaven, the east is where the sun is situated; and since where the sun rises is the morning, and the Sun there is always in its rising, and never sets, therefore the morning also has a similar signification.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"Recline in the kingdom of God' = "accumbentes I regno Dei." Swedenborg renders "anaklino" by accumbo. The A.V. renders "to sit down"; the R.V. follows the A.V. but has "recline" in the margin. Accumbo = "to recline," is according to classical usage. It was the custom for guests "to recline" at the triclinium or table, and not to sit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 422</h4><p>422. Verse 2. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, signifies the Divine love going forth from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "angel," as being something Divine proceeding from the Lord; for "angel" in the Word means, in the nearest sense, an entire angelic society, but in a general sense "angel" signifies everyone who receives Divine truth in doctrine and life; while in the highest sense "angel" signifies something Divine proceeding from the Lord, and in particular Divine truth (respecting these significations of an angel see above, n. <a href="../ae/90.htm">90</a>, <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/200.htm">200</a>, <a href="../ae/302.htm">302</a>, <a href="../ae/307.htm">307</a>); here, therefore, "the angel ascending from the rising of the sun" signifies the Divine proceeding from the Lord's love; "the rising of the sun" or the "east" signifying the Lord's Divine love, and "to ascend therefrom" signifying to go forth and proceed; so here "the angel ascending from the rising of the sun" signifies the Divine love going forth from the Lord. The things that follow are also of the Divine love, namely, that the good be not harmed. "The rising of the sun" signifies the Lord's Divine love, because the Lord is the sun in the angelic heaven, and the Lord appears as a sun from His Divine love; where the Lord appears as a sun, there in heaven is the east, and as the sun is constantly there it is also constantly in its rising.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world there are four quarters, namely, east, west, south, and north; and these quarters are all determined by the sun, which is the Lord; where this sun is, there is the east, opposite to it is the west, to the right the south, and to the left the north. In the eastern quarter angels who are in love to the Lord dwell, because they are under the nearest auspices of the Lord, for the Lord most nearly and directly flows into them from Divine love, and this is why "the rising of the sun" and the "east" signify in the Word the Lord's Divine love. (That the Lord appears in the angelic heaven as a sun, and that it is the Lord's Divine love that thus appears, see in the work on <a href="../hh/116.htm">Heaven and Hell 116-125</a>; consequently that the "sun" signifies in the Word the Divine love, see above, n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>; that all the quarters in the spiritual world are determined from the east, where the Lord is as a sun, see in the work on <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141</a>; therefore that those who are in the good of love to the Lord dwell in the eastern quarter, n. <a href="../ae/148.htm">148-149</a>.)</p><p>[3] The quarters, namely, the east, west, south, and north, are frequently mentioned in the Word, and he who knows nothing about the spiritual sense of the Word believes that this means the quarters of our solar world, and thus supposes that no arcana of heaven and the church are involved therein; and yet the quarters mentioned in the Word mean the quarters in the spiritual world; which are altogether different from the quarters in our world; for there all angels and spirits have their dwelling places in the quarters according to the quality of their good and truth; those who are in the good of love to the Lord dwelling there in the east and the west, and those who are in truths from that good dwelling in the south and north. They dwell in this manner because the Lord there is the sun, and from Him as the sun are all heat and light, or all good and truth. The heat there, which is spiritual heat or the good of love, inflows directly from the east into the west, and decreases according to reception by the angels, consequently according to the distances, for in the spiritual world all distance from the Lord is in the measure of the reception of good and truth from Him. This is why those who are in interior and thence in clear good of love dwell there in the east, and those who are in exterior and thence obscure good of love dwell in the west. The light, too, which is spiritual light, or Divine truth, flows directly from the east into the west; it also flows into either side, but with the difference, that the Divine truth that flows from the east into the west is in its essence the good of love, while that which flows into either side is in its essence truth from that good; consequently those who dwell in the south and in the north, which are the quarters at the sides, are in the light of truth; those in the south in the clear light of truth, and those in the north in an obscure light of truth; the light of truth is intelligence and wisdom. (But respecting these quarters more may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>.) These, therefore, are the quarters meant in the Word where quarters are mentioned, and they also signify such Divine things as exist in those quarters; namely, the "east" the good of love in clearness, the "west" the good of love in obscurity, the "south" truth from that good in clearness, and the "north" truth from that good in obscurity.</p><p>[4] Furthermore, there are quarters in the spiritual world which differ from those just mentioned, and are removed from them about thirty degrees; these are under the auspices of the Lord as a moon; for the Lord appears as a sun to those who are in love to Him, but as a moon to those who are in charity towards the neighbor and in faith therefrom (respecting this appearance, see also in the work on <a href="../hh/118.htm">Heaven and Hell 118</a>, <a href="../hh/119.htm">119</a>, <a href="../hh/122.htm">122</a>). In the eastern and western quarters there dwell those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor; and in the southern and northern quarters those who are in truths from that good, which are called the truths of faith. These quarters are also sometimes meant in the Word, where these truths and this good are treated of.</p><p>[5] From this it can be seen that one who knows nothing about the quarters of heaven, which have here been mentioned, cannot know the spiritual things of the Word in the passages where the quarters are mentioned, as in the following. In Isaiah:<p>I will bring in thy seed from the sunrise and bring thee together from the west; I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Hold not back; bring in My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_5.htm">Isaiah 43:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_6.htm">6</a>).<p>This treats of Jacob and Israel, and one who does not know that these quarters mean the spiritual things mentioned above, may believe the meaning to be that the sons of Israel and Jacob are to be gathered from every side; but "Jacob" and "Israel" mean the church, which consists of those who are in the good of love and in truths from that good, and their "seed" means all who are of that church. "I will bring in thy seed from the sunrise, and will bring thee together from the west," means that those who are in the good of love are to be brought in and gathered together; and "I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Hold not back," means that those who are in truths from that good are to be brought in and gathered together. That all who are in these truths and goods, even to those who are in ultimates shall be brought together, is signified by "bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth;" "sons" meaning those who are in truths, and "daughters" those who are in goods; "from far," and "from the end of the earth," signifying those who are in the ultimate truths and goods of the church. These quarters have a like signification in the following passages. In David:<p>Jehovah will gather the redeemed out of the lands, from the sunrise and from the west, from the north and from the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_107_3.htm">Psalms 107:3</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>Jehovah said to Jacob in a dream, Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall spread itself towards the west and towards the east, and towards the north and towards the south (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_28_14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p>In Luke:<p>They shall come from the sunrise and from the west, and from the north and from the south, and shall recline in the kingdom of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">Luke 13:29</a>).</p><p>[6] In many passages the words "from east to west," and not at the same time "from north and south," are mentioned, by which all who are in the good of love to the Lord and in the good of charity towards the neighbor are meant. Moreover, these quarters involve the two others, because all who are in good are also in truths, for good and truth everywhere act as one; these, therefore, are meant where "from east to west" is mentioned. In Matthew:<p>Many shall come from the east and even from the west, and shall recline at meat with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>).<p>In the passage above cited from Luke (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">13:29</a>), it is said of those reclining at meat in the kingdom of the heavens that "they shall come from the east and the west, from the north and from the south;" here it is said only "from the east and from the west," because by these two quarters are meant the other two at the same time as has been said. The same is true of the following passages. In Malachi:<p>From the rising of the sun unto its going down My name is great among the nations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_1_11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>).<p>In David:<p>From the rising of the sun unto its going down the name of Jehovah is to be praised <sup>1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_113_3.htm">Psalms 113:3</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>From the going down of the sun they shall fear the name of Jehovah, and His glory from the rising of the sun (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>).<p>In the same:<p>That they may know from the rising of the sun and from its going down that there is none beside Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a>).<p>In David:<p>God, Jehovah God, speaketh, and shall call the earth from the rising of the sun unto its going down (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_50_1.htm">Psalms 50:1</a>).<p>In Zechariah:<p>Behold, I save My people from the land of the sunrise and from the land of the going down of the sun (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_7.htm">Zechariah 8:7</a>).<p>In these passages, "from the rising" and "from the going down" signify all who are in the goods and truths of heaven and of the church. Like things are signified by the quarters:<p>With reference to which the temple was measured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">Ezekiel 42</a>).<p>And with reference to which the land was to be given for an inheritance (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, et seq .).<p>And should be distributed among the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>).<p>Also with reference to which the sons of Israel were to measure the camp (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_2_1.htm">Numbers 2</a>).<p>And with reference to which they should go forward (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10</a>).<p>And with reference to which the gates of the new city would be placed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_13.htm">Revelation 21:13</a>; and the same elsewhere).</p><p>[7] The temple was to be measured with reference to the quarters (in Ezekiel), and the land was distributed with reference to the quarters (in Ezekiel and also in Joshua), likewise the sons of Israel encamped in reference to the quarters and went forward in the same order, for the reason that all things in the spiritual world are arranged in reference to the quarters, both in general and also in particular. In general, all angels and spirits have their dwelling places in accordance with the states of good and truth with them in corresponding quarters, as was said above; the same is true in particular; for in all assemblies, those who are present are allotted places in quarters that correspond to the states of their life; in like manner they are seated in their temples there, and in like manner also dwell in their houses: in a word, each and every thing there is arranged in accordance with the quarters of heaven; for the form of heaven is the same in every particular as it is in general. This makes evident what is signified by the arrangements in reference to quarters in the Word, also by the quarters in reference to which the tabernacle was built, and in reference to which the temple also was built by Solomon; besides other things.</p><p>[8] So much in respect to quarters in general. That the "east" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, and thus the Lord with those who receive the good of love to Him, can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>He brought me to the gate of the temple that looketh toward the east; and behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and His voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was enlightened by His glory. And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose face is toward the east. Then the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">5</a>).<p>This treats of the building of a new temple, which signifies a new church to be established by the Lord; and because introduction is effected through the good of love to the Lord and through the truth from that good, there was seen "a gate that looked towards the east, and the God of Israel coming from the way of the east;" "gate" signifying introduction and entrance; "the God of Israel" meaning the Lord; the "east" the good of love from Him to Him, and "glory" the truth from that good; for the Lord enters into heaven and so into the church from His Divine love, which in the heavens appears as a sun (as was said above); from this is all Divine good there as well as all Divine truth. That there was seen "the glory of Jehovah entering into the house by the way of the gate whose face is towards the east," and that "the glory of Jehovah filled the house," have a like signification; "house" or "temple" signifying heaven and the church. "Glory" in the Word signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; "the glory of the God of Israel" Divine truth illustrating those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and "the glory of Jehovah" Divine truth illustrating those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom. Divine truth is called "glory" because it is the light of heaven, and from that light come all the splendor, magnificence, and glory there, for in the heavens whatever appears before the eyes is from that light; it is therefore added, "the earth was enlightened by His glory," "the earth" meaning the church. The influx of this light towards the lower parts on every side is signified by "His voice was like the voice of many waters; "voice" signifying influx, and "waters" truths.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>Afterwards He brought me back by the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary that looketh towards the east; and it was shut. But Jehovah the God of Israel shall enter in by it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_44_1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_44_2.htm">2</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six days of work; but on the day of the Sabbath it shall be opened (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_46_1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>).<p>Here, too, "the gate that looketh towards the east" signifies the introduction by the Lord into heaven and into the church through the good of love proceeding from Him; this therefore is meant by "the east;" and that this is done by the Lord is signified by "Jehovah the God of Israel shall enter by that gate;" that introduction is effected by worship of the Lord from that good is signified by "the gate shall be opened on the day of the Sabbath;" and that when there is no worship from that good introduction is not effected is signified by "that gate shall be shut the six days of work."</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and he stood at the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah on the east; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above (<a href="../ae/152.htm">152</a>, <a href="../ae/277.htm">277</a>); and as the Lord is signified by "the cherubim," and from the Lord as a sun, where the east is, all good of love and all truth from that good proceed, so "the cherubim were seen to stand at the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah on the east, and the glory of the God of Israel over them above;" "the house of Jehovah," "the east," and "the glory of the God of Israel," having a similar signification here as above.</p><p>[11] In Isaiah:<p>Who hath stirred up one from the sunrise, whom He hath called in righteousness to His train, He hath given the nations before him and made him to rule over kings? (<a href="../ae/293.htm">293</a> what the rest signifies was explained above, n. <a href="../ae/357.htm">357</a>.)</p><p>[12] In the second book of Samuel:<p>The spirit of Jehovah spake in me, the God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, As the light of the morning when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; from the brightness after rain cometh grass out of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2-4</a>).<p>"The God of Israel" and "the Rock of Israel" mean the Lord, and because He is the sun of the angelic heaven, and because all Divine truth which illustrates angels and men, and gives intelligence and works reformation, proceeds from Him as a sun and flows in, so it is said "as the light in the morning when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; from the brightness after rain cometh grass out of the earth;" "the light in the morning when the sun riseth" signifying Divine truth from the Lord as a sun; "a morning without clouds" signifying the purity of that truth; "rain" its influx, and "grass out of the earth" the consequent intelligence and reformation; for these are signified by "grass" because grass springs out of the earth by the action of the sun of the world after rain, and intelligence is from the Lord as a sun through the influx of Divine truth.</p><p>[13] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And the nations shall walk to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_3.htm">3</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord; and the Divine in Him is meant by "Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee;" the Divine good of the Divine love is meant by "Jehovah shall arise upon thee," and Divine truth from that good by "His glory shall be seen upon thee;" "nations" signify those who are in good, and "kings" those who are in truths from good; of the former it is said "they shall walk to thy light," which signifies a life according to Divine truth; and of the latter, "they shall walk to the brightness of thy rising," which signifies a life of intelligence from Divine good; "to walk" signifying to live; "light" Divine truth, and "the brightness of rising" Divine truth from Divine good, whence is intelligence.</p><p>[14] In Ezekiel:<p>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. And the glory of Jehovah went up over the midst of the city, and stood over the mountain on the east of the city (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_23.htm">23</a>).<p>"The cherubim" signify the Lord in respect to Divine Providence and protection, and "the glory of the God of Israel" signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (as above). And because Divine truth, which is light, proceeds from the Lord as a sun in the angelic heaven, "the glory of Jehovah was seen to go up over the midst of the city, and to stand over the mountain on the east of the city," for Jerusalem is the city that is meant, and it signifies the church in respect to doctrine; and because the doctrine of the church is from Divine truth, the glory of Jehovah was seen "to go up over the midst of the city," and because all Divine truth proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and there the east is, the glory was seen "to stand over the mountain on the east of the city;" the mountain on the east of the city was the Mount of Olives. That "the Mount of Olives" signifies the Lord's Divine love, and on that account the Lord was accustomed to tarry on that mountain, may be seen above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>).</p><p>[15] In Ezekiel:<p>He brought me back to the entrance of the house; where behold, waters going out from under the threshold of the house towards the east, the front of the house being east, and the waters coming down from under, from the right side of the house, at the south of the altar. And he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the outer way to the outer gate, by the way that looketh eastward; and behold, waters running from the right side. He said to me, These waters go forth toward the eastern boundary, and go down into the plain, and come towards the sea, being sent forth into the sea that the waters may be healed; whence it cometh to pass that every living soul that creeps, whithersoever the brooks come, liveth; whence there is exceeding much fish. And by the brook upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, cometh up every tree for food, whose leaf falleth not, nor does its fruit come to an end (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">12</a>).<p>This describes a new church to be established by the Lord in the heavens and on the earth, when everything Divine shall proceed from the Lord's Divine Human; for before the Lord's coming the Divine proceeded from His Divine that He calls "the Father," but after the church had become vastated, this did not reach to the ultimates. Here "house" signifies the church, its "gate" entrance and introduction, the "east" the Lord where His Divine love appears as a sun, and "the waters going out" Divine truth proceeding from that sun. The "plain" and the "sea" signify the ultimates of the church, that is, where those are who are in ultimate truths and goods, to whom the Divine did not reach before, because they are natural and sensual, and but little spiritual. That "the waters of the sea were healed by the flowing in of the brook from the east" signifies that after the Lord's coming even these had life from the Divine; "exceeding much fish" signifies the abundance of cognitions and knowledges, which in such also acquire spiritual life; the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth are signified by "on the bank of the brook every tree for food cometh up, whose leaf falleth not off, and its fruit does not come to an end." From this it can be seen what the particulars here signify in series, and that "the east," from which they all are, signifies the Lord and His Divine love.</p><p>[16] The like is signified in Zechariah:<p>And it shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; part of them to the eastern sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>).<p>This, too, treats of the Lord. "In that day" signifies His coming, and the "eastern sea" signifies the last limit toward the east in the spiritual world, at which there was no reception of Divine truth before the Lord's coming, but where there was reception when Divine truth proceeded from His Divine Human. That the ultimates in the spiritual world are like seas may be seen above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>).</p><p>[17] Because in heaven, where the angels are, the Lord appears as a sun, and is there the east:<p>So Aaron, when he made expiation for himself and his house, sprinkled of the blood of the bullock before the mercy-seat eastward (<a href="../hh/17.htm">Heaven and Hell 17</a>, <a href="../hh/123.htm">123</a>, <a href="../hh/142.htm">142-144</a>, <a href="../hh/272.htm">272</a>)</p><p>[18] Because the Lord is the east it is said in Matthew:<p>As the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of man be (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>).<p>Since "the rising of the sun" signifies in reference to men the good of love, proceeding from the Lord as a sun, received by them, it is said in the book of Judges:<p>Let all Thine enemies perish, O Jehovah; but let them that love Him be as the rising of the sun in his might (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>).<p>This is in the prophetic song of Deborah and Barak; and of those who love Jehovah, who are those that are in the good of love to the Lord, it is said, "Let them be as the rising of the sun in his might."</p><p>[19] In Moses:<p>Joseph shall have of the firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and of the precious things of the hills of an age (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>.)</p><p>[20] In ancient times there was a church in many kingdoms of Asia, as in the land of Canaan, in Syria and Assyria, in Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Chaldea, in Tyre and Sidon, and elsewhere; but the church with them was a representative church, for in all the particulars of their worship, and in every one of their statutes, spiritual and celestial things, which are the internals of the church, were represented, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself was represented. These representatives in worship and statutes remained with many even to the Lord's coming, and thence there was a knowledge of His coming; as can be seen from the predictions of Balaam, who was from Syria, and who prophesied of the Lord in these words:<p>I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not nigh; there shall arise a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>).<p>That this knowledge was afterwards preserved is evident from this, that certain wise men from the east, when the Lord was born saw a star from the east, which they followed, which is thus described in Matthew:<p>In the days of Herod the king wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we saw His star in the east, and have come to worship Him; and lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9</a>).<p>The star appeared to those from the east because the Lord is the east; and because they had knowledge respecting the Lord's coming from representatives that were with them, the star appeared and went before them, first to Jerusalem, which represented the church itself in respect to doctrine and in respect to the Word, and from there to the place where the infant Lord lay. Moreover, a "star" signifies the knowledges of good and truth, and in the highest sense the knowledge respecting the Lord. (That "stars" signify in the Word the knowledges of good and truth, see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>). Also "sons of the east" signify in the Word the knowledges of good and truth; "Kedar," that is, Arabia, has a similar signification. That Job was one of the sons of the east is evident from <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_1_3.htm">Job 1:3</a>).</p><p>[21] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so does "the east," and in that sense it signifies the love of self, because this love is the opposite of love to the Lord. In this sense the east is mentioned in <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>; and the morning, n. <a href="../ae/176.htm">176</a>; for where the sun is in the angelic heaven there is the east; and as the morning is where the sun rises, and there the sun is always in its rising and never setting, so "morning" has a like signification.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "great," but we find "to be praised" in n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>, and Apocalypse Revealed <a href="../ae/809.htm">809</a>. </p>

"Et vidi alium angelum ascendentem ab ortu solis." - Quod significet Divinum Amorem exeuntem a Domino, constat ex significatione "angeli", quod sit aliquod Divinum procedens a Domino; per "angelum" enim in Verbo in sensu proximo intelligitur integra societas angelica, in sensu communi autem per "angelum" significatur omnis qui recipit Divinum Verum doctrina et vita; at in supremo sensu per "angelum" significatur aliquod Divinum quod procedit a Domino, in specie Divinum Verum (de quibus significationibus "angeli" videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_422/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_90" target=_top>90</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_422/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_130" target=_top>130</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_422/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_200" target=_top>200</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_422/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_302" target=_top>302</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_422/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_307" target=_top>307</a>); hic itaque per "angelum ascendentem ab ortu solis" significatur Divinum procedens ex Amore Domini: "ortus solis" seu "oriens" significat Divinum Amorem Domini; et "ascendere inde" significat exire et procedere; inde nunc per "angelum ascendentem ab ortu solis" significatur Divinus Amor exiens ex Domino: illa quae sequuntur etiam sunt Divini Amoris, ne scilicet laedantur boni. <p>Quod "ortus solis" significet Divinum Amorem Domini, est quia Dominus in caelo angelico est Sol, et Dominus ut Sol apparet ex Divino suo Amore; ubi Dominus ut Sol apparet, ibi in caelo est oriens; et quia constanter ibi est, etiam constanter est in ortu.<p>[2] Sunt in mundo spirituali quatuor plagae, nempe oriens, occidens, meridies et septentrio; omnes illae plagae determinantur a Sole qui est Dominus; et ubi Sol ibi est oriens, ex opposito inde est occidens, ad dextrum est meridies, et ad sinistrum est septentrio. In plaga orientis habitant angeli qui in amore in Dominum Sunt, ex causa quia sub proximo auspicio Domini sunt, influit enim in illos Dominus proxime et directe ex Divino Amore; inde est quod per "ortum solis" et per "orientem" in Verbo significetur Divinus Amor Domini.

Omnes enim angeli et spiritus habitant ibi in plagis secundum quale sui boni et veri; qui in bono amoris in Dominum Sunt, habitant in oriente et occidente ibi; et qui in veris ex illo bono sunt, habitant in meridie et septentrione: causa quod ita habitent, est quia Dominus ibi est Sol, et ab Ipso ut Sole ibi est omnis calor et lux, seu omne bonum et verum. Calor ibi, qui est calor spiritualis seu bonum amoris, directe influit ab oriente in occidentem; et secundum receptionem ab angelis decrescit, proinde secundum distantias; nam omnis distantia a Domino in mundo spirituali est secundum receptionem boni et veri ab Ipso: haec est causa quod in oriente ibi habitent qui in bono amoris interiori et inde claro sunt, et in occidente qui in bono amoris exteriori et inde obscuro sunt. At lux, quae est lux spiritualis seu Divinum Verum, etiam directe influit ab oriente in occidentem, et quoque influit in latera utrinque; sed cum differentia quod Divinum Verum quod influit ab oriente in occidentem in sua essentia sit bonum amoris, at quod in latera utrinque influit in sua essentia sit verum ex illo bono: inde illi qui habitant in meridie et in septentrione, quae plagae utrinque a latere sunt, in luce veri sint; qui in meridie in luce veri clara, et qui in septentrione in luce veri obscura; lux veri est intelligentia et sapientia.
