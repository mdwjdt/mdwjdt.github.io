<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 364</h4><p>364. (Verse 4) And there went out another horse that was red. That this signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good, is clear from the signification of a horse as denoting the Intellectual (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/355.htm">355</a>); in the present case, because the states of those who belong to the church where the Word is, are treated of. By a horse is signified the Intellectual of the men of the church as to the Word. And from the signification of red or reddish, as denoting the quality of a thing as to good, therefore, in the present case, the quality of the understanding of the Word as to good. That reddish here signifies this destroyed as to good, is evident from what immediately follows in this verse, for it is said, it was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great sword, by which is signified, that there was thence the extinction of all truth. Because the horses seen by John, were distinguished by colours (for the first appeared white, the second red, the third black, and the fourth pale), and colours signify the qualities of things, therefore something shall first be said here concerning colours. In the heavens there appear colours of every kind, and they derive their origin from the light there, which light, as it immensely excels in brightness and splendour the light of the world, so also do the colours there; and because the light there is from the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, and is the proceeding Divine, and hence that light is spiritual, therefore also all colours signify things spiritual. And since the proceeding Divine is the Divine good united to the Divine truth, and the Divine good in heaven is manifested by a flaming light, and the Divine truth by a white light, therefore, there are two fundamental colours there, namely, red and white; the red colour derives its origin from the flaming light which proceeds from the Divine good, and the white from the white light which proceeds from the Divine truth; therefore in proportion as colours are derived from red they signify good, and so far as they are derived from white, they signify truth.<p>(But these things will be more evident from what is said from experience concerning colours in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that the most beautiful colours appear in the heavens (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1624.htm">1624</a>); that colours in the heavens are from the light there, and that they are the modifications and variations thereof (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1042.htm">1042</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1624.htm">1624</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4530.htm">4530</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4922.htm">4922</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4742.htm">4742</a>); that thus they are appearances of truth and good, and signify such things as pertain to intelligence and wisdom (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4530.htm">4530</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4922.htm">4922</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1677.htm">1677</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9466.htm">9466</a>); that therefore the precious stones, which were of various colours, in the breast-plate of the ephod, or in the urim and thummim, signified all things of truth from good in heaven and in the church, and that hence the breast-plate in general signified the Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9823.htm">9823</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>); and that hence responses were given by variegations and resplendences of light, and at the same time by silent perception, or by a living voice out of heaven (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3862.htm">3862</a>); that colours signify good in proportion as they are derived from red, and truth in proportion as they are from white (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9467.htm">9467</a>). Concerning the light of heaven, whence and what it is, see the work concerning <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>, <a href="../hh/275.htm">275</a>.)</p><p>[2] Moreover it should be known, that red not only signifies the quality of a thing as to good, but also the quality of a thing as to evil; for that colour exists from the flaming light which is the light from the Sun of heaven, as said above, and it also exists from the flaming [quality] in hell, which is from the fire there, this fire being like a coal fire. Hence the red in heaven is altogether different from the red in hell; the red in heaven is shining and living, whereas the red in hell is hideously obscure and dead; the red of heaven also imparts life, but the red of hell death; the reason is, that the fire from which red is produced is in its origin love, celestial fire, being from celestial love, and infernal fire from infernal love; hence it is that fire in the Word signifies love in both senses (as may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7575.htm">7575</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10747.htm">10747</a>; and in the work concerning, <a href="../hh/134.htm">Heaven and Hell 134</a>, <a href="../hh/566.htm">566-575</a>); therefore the red existing therefrom signifies the quality of the love in both senses. This red also, or the red colour of this horse, in the original Greek, is expressed [by a word derived] from fire. From these considerations, and at the same time from the description of this horse in this verse, it is evident why it is that a red horse signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good. That a horse signifies something of this sort, is quite evident from the fact, that the horses were seen when the seals were opened, and it is said that they went out, for horses could not go forth out of the book, but that those things were to be manifested that are signified by horses. That a horse signifies the Intellectual, and colour its quality, has been made well known to me from experience; for spirits who were meditating from the understanding upon some subject have appeared to me at different times riding upon horses, and when I asked them whether they were riding, they said they were not, but that they stood meditating upon the subject; hence it was evident, that riding upon a horse was an appearance representative of the operation of their understanding.</p><p>[3] There is also a place, which is called the assembly of the intelligent and wise, whither many resort for meditation, and when any one enters it, there appear to him horses of various colours, and variously caparisoned, and also chariots, and some riding, and others sitting in the chariots; when asked whether they ride upon horses, and are carried in chariots, they say that they are not, but that they go along meditating; hence also it was evident what is signified by horses, and by chariots. (But upon this subject more may be seen in the small work concerning the White Horse.) From these considerations, it is now evident, why it is that horses were seen by John when the seals of the book were opened, and also what they signify. The reason why those horses were seen, is, because all the spiritual things of the Word are set forth in the sense of its letter by such things as correspond or represent, and thence signify them, and this in order that the Divine may be there in ultimates, and, consequently, in fulness, as has been frequently said above.</p><p>[4] That reddish or red signifies the quality of a thing as to good is also evident from the following passages in the Word: In Moses:<p>Who washes his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes. His eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_12.htm">12</a>).<p>These words are in the prophecy of the father Israel concerning Judah, and by Judah is there meant the Lord as to the good of love, and in a relative sense the Lord's celestial kingdom. What is signified by each particular there, in the spiritual sense, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained. The Divine wisdom which is from the Divine good, is signified by his eyes being redder than wine; and the Divine intelligence, which is from the Divine truth, by his teeth being whiter than milk.</p><p>[5] In Lamentations:<p>"The Nazarites were whiter than snow, they were whiter than milk, their bones were more ruddy than pearls" (<a href="../ae/66.htm">66</a>, <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>, at the end), wherefore also, in a relative sense, the good of celestial love was signified by them, because this good proceeds immediately from the Lord's Divine Human; its representative in the church is thus described. The truth of that good is signified by their being whiter than snow, and whiter than milk; and the good of truth, by their bones being more ruddy than pearls. For bones signify truths in their ultimate, thus truths in their whole extent, for in ultimates all things are together, and in fulness.</p><p>[6] That they are from good, and also are goods, is signified by their being ruddy. In Zechariah:<p>"I beheld four chariots going out from between mountains of brass. In the first chariot were red horses; In the second chariot black horses; in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled horses, strong" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">6:1-3</a>).<p>That by the red horses is here also signified the quality of the understanding as to good in the beginning, by the black horses the quality of the understanding as to truth in the beginning, by the white horses the quality of the understanding as to truth afterwards, by the grisled horses the quality of the understanding as to truth and good afterwards, and by strong the quality thereof thence as to the power of resisting falsities and evils, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">1:8</a>). Because by red or ruddy is signified the quality of a thing as to good, therefore, red rams' skins were used for the covering over the tabernacle (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_14.htm">26:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_35_7.htm">35:7</a>). And, therefore, also the water of separation, by which they were cleansed, was made from the ashes of a red heifer (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_19_1.htm">Numbers 19:1-10</a>). By the red heifer is signified the good of the natural man, and by the water of separation, made from those ashes, is signified the truth of the natural man; and this was commanded because all cleansing is effected by truths; the particulars also respecting the slaying of it, and respecting the preparation of the water of cleansing from it, involve spiritual things.</p><p>[7] Because red signifies the quality of a thing as to good, therefore, also names and things, which are named from the same expression in the original tongue, signify the good in which they originate. Red, in the original tongue, is called Adam, whence the name Adam, and also the name Edom, and hence also man is called Adam, the ground Adama, and the ruby Odam; thus, those names and those things are from red. By Adam is signified the Most Ancient Church, which was the church that was in the good of love; the same is signified by man, and also by ground in the spiritual sense, where celestial good is treated of. That Edom was named from red may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_25_30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>; and hence the truth of the good of the natural man is signified by him. That the ruby is also named from red, may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_39_10.htm">39:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>; hence it is that by the ruby is signified the truth of celestial good. (That Adam signifies the Most Ancient Church, which was the celestial church, or the church that was in the good of love to the Lord, may be seen, (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_18.htm">1:18</a>).<p>And in Nahum:<p>"The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in purple; in a fire of torches are his chariots, the chariots raged in the streets; they ran to and fro in the broad ways, the appearance of them as of torches" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_2_3.htm">2:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_2_4.htm">4</a>).<p>In that sense also the dragon is called red (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Apoc. 12:3</a>); which will be explained in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 364</h4><p>364. Verse 4. And there went forth another horse that was red, signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good. This is evident from the signification of "horse," as being the intellect (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/355.htm">355</a>. Here because the states of those who are of the church where the Word is are treated of, "horse" signifies the intellect of the men of the church in relation to the Word. It is also evident from the signification of "red" [ruber] or "reddish" [rufus], as being of what nature a thing is in relation to good, so here, of what quality the understanding of the Word is in relation to good. That "reddish" [rufus] here signifies this understanding destroyed in respect to good, can be seen from what immediately follows in this verse, for it is said, "to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, that they should slay one another, and to him was given a great sword," which signifies a consequent extinction of all truth. Since the horses that John saw were distinguished by colors, for the first appeared "white," the second "red," the third "black," and the fourth "pale," and colors signify the quality of a thing, let something first be said here about colors.<p>In the heavens colors of every kind appear, and they draw their origin from the light there; and as that light immensely excels in brightness and splendor the light of the world, so also do the colors there; and as the light there is from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, and is the Divine Proceeding, and as consequently that light is spiritual, so all colors signify things spiritual. And as the Divine Proceeding is Divine good united to Divine truth, and as Divine good in heaven is presented to view by a flamy light, and Divine truth by a bright white light, so there are two colors that are the fundamentals of all colors there, namely, the red color and the white color; the red color has its origin from the flamy light that goes forth from Divine good, and the white color from the bright white light that goes forth from Divine truth; consequently so far as colors are derived from red they signify good, and so far as they are derived from white they signify truth. (But these things can be seen better from what is told about colors, from experience, in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that most beautiful colors are seen in the heavens, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1624.htm">1624</a>; colors in the heavens are from the light there, and are modifications and variations of light, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1042.htm">1042</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1624.htm">1624</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4530.htm">4530</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4742.htm">4742</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4922.htm">4922</a>; thus they are the appearances of truth and good, and signify such things as are of intelligence and wisdom, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4530.htm">4530</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4677.htm">4677</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4922.htm">4922</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9466.htm">9466</a>; consequently the precious stones that were of various colors in the breastplate of the ephod, or in the Urim and Thummim, signified all things of truth from good in heaven and in the church, and therefore the breastplate in general signified Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9823.htm">9823</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9905.htm">9905</a>; and responses were thence given by variegations and resplendences of light, and at the same time by tacit perception, or by a living voice out of heaven, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3862.htm">3862</a>, [ 9905; colors so far as they are derived from red signify good, and so far as they are from bright white signify truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9467.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9467</a>. Of the Light of Heaven, whence and what it is, see in the work on <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a> (<a href="../hh/275.htm">Heaven and Hell 275</a>)-140, 275.)</p><p>[2] It is to be known, moreover, that "red" color not only signifies what the quality of a thing is in relation to good, but also what the quality of a thing is in relation to evil; for that color not only exists from the flamy light that is from the sun of heaven, as was said above, but it also exists from something flamy in hell, which is from the fire there, which fire is like a coal fire. Therefore the red in heaven is a wholly different red from the red in hell; the red in heaven is shining and living, while the red in hell is horribly obscure and dead; moreover, the red of heaven gives life, while the red of hell brings death; the reason is that the fire from which red is derived is in its origin love; heavenly fire is from heavenly love, and infernal fire from infernal love; consequently "fire" in the Word signifies love in both senses (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4906.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4906</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7575.htm">7575</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10747.htm">10747</a>; and in the work on Heaven and Hell (<a href="../hh/134.htm">Heaven and Hell 134</a>), n. <a href="../hh/134.htm">134</a>, <a href="../hh/566.htm">566-575</a>); therefore the "red" existing thence signifies the quality of the love in both senses. Moreover, this red, that is, the "red" of this horse is, in the original Greek, from a word that means fire. All this, together with the description of this horse in this verse, makes clear why it is that a "red horse" signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good.<p>That "horse" signifies something connected with the subject can be clearly seen from this, that horses were seen when "the seals were opened," and it was said that "they went forth," for horses could not go forth out of a book, but those things could be manifested which are signified by "horses." That "horse" signifies the intellect, and "color" its quality, has been made familiar to me from experience; for spirits who were meditating from the understanding upon some subject have several times been seen by me to be riding upon horses, and when I asked them whether they were riding, they said that they were not, but that they stood meditating upon some subject; which made clear that riding upon a horse is an appearance representing the operation of their understanding.</p><p>[3] There is also a place called the assembly of the intelligent and wise, to which very many resort for meditation, and when anyone is coming to it horses of various colors and variously caparisoned, and also chariots, with some riding and others sitting in the chariots, appear to him; and then also when they are asked whether they are riding upon horses, or are carried in chariots, they say that they are not, but that they are going along meditating; from this also it was clear what is signified by "horses" and by "chariots." (But about this see more in the small work on The White Horse.) From this it can now be seen why John saw horses when the seals of the book were opened, and also what they signify. These horses were seen, because all the spiritual things of the Word are presented in the sense of its letter by means of such things as correspond, that is, as represent and thence signify; and this in order that the Divine may be there in ultimates and consequently in fullness, as has been several times said above.</p><p>[4] That "reddish" [rufus] or "red" [ruber] signifies the quality of a thing in relation to good, can be seen also from the following passages in the Word. In Moses:<p>Who washeth his vesture in wine, and his covering in the blood of the grapes. His eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11-12</a>).<p>These words are in the prophecy of Israel the father respecting Judah, and "Judah" here means the Lord in relation to the good of love, and in a relative sense the Lord's celestial kingdom. What the particulars here signify in the spiritual sense may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained. Divine wisdom which is from Divine good is signified by "his eyes are redder than wine;" and Divine intelligence which is from Divine truth by "his teeth are whiter than milk."</p><p>[5] In Lamentations:<p>The Nazarites were whiter than snow, they were brighter than milk, their bones were more ruddy than pearls (<a href="../ae/66.htm">66</a>, <a href="../ae/196.htm">196</a>, at the end), therefore they signified also, in a relative sense, the good of celestial love, because this good immediately proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human. The representative of this in the church is thus described, the truth of that good is signified by "they were whiter than snow, and brighter than milk," and the good of truth by "their bones were more ruddy than pearls;" for "bones" signify truths in their ultimate, thus truths in the whole complex, for in ultimates all things are together and in fullness; that these truths are from good, and also are goods, is signified by their being "ruddy."</p><p>[6] In Zechariah:<p>I saw four chariots coming out from between mountains of copper. In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses; in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled horses, stout (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-3</a>).<p>That here, too, "red horses" signify the quality of the understanding in the beginning in relation to good, "black horses" the quality of the understanding in the beginning in relation to truth, "white horses" the quality of the understanding afterwards in relation to truth, "grisled horses" what is the quality of the understanding afterwards in relation to truth and good, and "stout" what it is consequently in respect to the power to resist falsities and evils, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>).<p>Because "red" [ruber] or "reddish" [rufus] signifies the quality of a thing in relation to good:<p>Red rams' skins were used for a covering over the tent (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_25_5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_14.htm">26:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_35_7.htm">35:7</a>).<p>And therefore also:<p>The water of separation, used in cleansing, was made from a red heifer burned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_19_1.htm">Numbers 19:1-10</a>);<p>"red heifer" signifying the good of the natural man, and the "water of separation" made from it when burned signifying the truth of the natural man; and this was commanded because all cleansing is effected by means of truths; moreover, the particulars of the process of slaying the heifer, and of preparing the water for cleansing by it, involve spiritual things.</p><p>[7] Because "red" signifies the quality of a thing in relation to good, those names also and the things that derive their names from this same word in the original tongue signify the good from which they are. The word red in the original is adam, from which is the name Adam, and also the name Edom; from this also man is called adam, the ground adama, and the ruby odam; thus these names and things are from red. "Adam" signifies the Most Ancient Church, a church that was in the good of love; "Man" has a like signification, also "ground" in the spiritual sense when celestial good is treated of. That "Edom" was named from red, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_25_30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>; and for this reason it signifies the truth of the good of the natural man. That the ruby is also named from red may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_39_10.htm">39:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>; for this reason "ruby" signifies the truth of celestial good.

"Et exivit alius equus rufus." - Quod significet intellectum Verbi deperditum quoad bonum, constat ex significatione "equi", quod sit intellectuale (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_364/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_355" target=_top>355</a>); hic quia de statibus eorum qui ab ecclesia ubi Verbum est, agitur, per "equum", significatur intellectuale hominum ecclesiae quoad Verbum: et ex significatione "rubri" seu "rufi", quod sit quale rei quoad bonum, hic itaque quale intellectus Verbi quoad bonum; quod "rufum" hic significet illum deperditum quoad bonum, constare potest ex mox sequentibus in hoc versu, dicitur enim, "Sedenti super illo datum est tollere pacem de terra, ut alii alios occidant, et data ei machaera magna", per quae significatur quod inde exstinctio omnis veri. Quoniam equi, qui Johanni visi sunt, distinguuntur per colores, primus enim apparuit albus, secundus rufus, tertius niger, et quartus pallidus, et colores" significant quale rei, ideo hic primum aliquid de coloribus dicetur. Apparent in caelis colores omnis generis, et originem trahunt a luce ibi, quae lux quia immensum excedit nitore et splendore lucem mundi, ita quoque colores ibi; et quia lux ibi est ex Sole caeli, qui est Dominus, et est Divinum procedens, et inde illa lux est spiritualis, quare etiam omnes colores significant spiritualia: et quia Divinum procedens est Divinum Bonum unitum Divino Vero, ac Divinum Bonum in caelo sistitur per lucem flammeam ac Divinum Verum per lucem candidam, ideo Sunt bini colores qui ibi omnium fundamentales sunt, nempe color ruber et color albus; color ruber originem ducit ex luce flammea quae est ex Divino Bono, et color albus ex luce candida quae est ex Divino Vero; quapropter quantum colores trahunt ex rubro, tantum significant bonum; et quantum ex candido, tantum significant verum.
