<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 470</h4><p>470. Verses 13-17. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are clothed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they? And I said unto him, Lord, thou knowest. And he said unto me, These are they who come out of great tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and make their robes white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.-<p>"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me," signifies influx out of heaven from the Lord, and thence perception; "These that are clothed in white robes, who are they, [and whence came they]?" signifies, concerning those who are now in truths, and in the protection of the Lord, of what quality they are and of what quality they have been. "And I said unto him, Lord, thou knowest," signifies that it is known to the Lord alone; "And he said unto me, These are they who come out of great tribulation," signifies information, that they are those who had been in temptations; "and they did wash their robes," signifies removal of falsities by means of temptations; "and make their robes white in the blood of the Lamb," signifies implantation of Divine Truth from the Lord. "Therefore are they before the throne of God," signifies, that consequently they are conjoined to the Lord; "and serve him day and night in his temple," signifies, that in heaven they are continually kept in truths; "and he who sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them," signifies influx of Divine good into truths with them. "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more," signifies, that good and truth and happiness therefrom shall not fail them; "neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat," signifies, that in them there will be no evil and falsity springing from lusts. "For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them," signifies, that the Lord will instruct them from heaven; "and shall lead them unto living fountains of water," signifies, in Divine truths; "and God shall wipe every tear from their eyes," signifies, their state of blessedness, from the affection of truth, after falsities have been removed by means of temptations. </p>
