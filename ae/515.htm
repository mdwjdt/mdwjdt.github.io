<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 515</h4><p>515. Verses 10, 11. And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp; and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.- "And the third angel sounded," signifies influx out of heaven, and thence the third change with the evil; "and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp," signifies the truth of the Word, falsified from the proprium love; "and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters," signifies that thence all understanding of truth perished, and through that the doctrine of the church. "And the name of the star is called Wormwood," signifies truth mingled with the falsity of evil; "and the third part of the waters became wormwood," signifies that all truth became such in the understanding and in doctrine; "and many men died of the waters," signifies that all who were such, perished by the falsities into which the truths of the Word were turned; "because they were made bitter," signifies because the truths of the Word were falsified. </p>
