<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 511</h4><p>511. Was cast into the sea.- This signifies into the natural man, as is evident from the signification of the sea, as denoting what is scientific (scientificum) in general, which is in the natural man, consequently, the natural man as to what is scientific therein, concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/270.htm">270</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>). The reason of this signification of the sea, is, that water signifies truth, and truth in the natural man is called scientific; but truth in itself, is spiritual, and in the spiritual man it makes one with the affection for truth, for it is the form of the affection there. As far therefore as this affection, with its form, is thence in the scientifics which are in the natural man, so far the scientifics contain in themselves truths, and are scientific truths; for the scientifics of the natural man, considered in themselves, are not truths, but only the containing vessels of truth, wherefore scientifics are also signified by vessels in the Word.</p><p>[2] That the natural man is signified by the sea, is clear from the passages in the Word quoted above (n. <a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>); from which it is evident that the sea, as to the water, signifies what is scientific (scientificum) in general, and the sea, considered with respect to its waves, signifies the disputation and reasoning which arise through scientifics; and because each of these is in the natural man, therefore, the sea signifies the natural man itself. But the state of the natural man is entirely according to the affection of man's love. When spiritual affection rules in man, or the affection for good and truth for the sake of good and truth, and this flows in through the spiritual man into the natural man, then the natural man is a spiritual-natural man, for he is then subordinate and subject to the spiritual man, and because they thus act as a one, both are in heaven. But when affection merely natural rules with man, then in the natural man there is not any truth, and no scientific therein is true, but dead and false. The reason is, that the scientifics there are then conjoined with affections merely natural, all of which have their origin from the loves of self and of the world; and yet real truths, being in themselves spiritual, conjoin themselves only with spiritual affections, as stated above. When truths conjoin themselves with affections merely natural, then they are no longer truths but falsities, for the affection merely natural falsifies them. Conjunctions of truth with affections merely natural, correspond to whoredoms and adulteries of various kinds, and are also meant in the spiritual sense of the Word by the varieties of whoredoms and the degrees of adulteries; there are conjunctions of the truths of the Word with the love of self and the love of the world, which correspond to these things.</p><p>[3] The signification of the sea, which denotes the natural man, and all things therein, is also from correspondence. For seas appear in various places in the spiritual world, especially about the outermost borders where the spiritual societies, or heaven itself, terminate. Seas exist there, because in the borders of heaven, and beyond them, are those who were merely natural men; they also appear there in deep places, where they have their abodes; these natural men however are not evil, for evil natural men are in the hells. The quality of those who are in those seas is evident from the seas which are seen there, but chiefly from the colour of the waters, which tend to obscurity or to clearness; if to obscurity, sensual spirits are therein, who are the lowest natural, and if to clearness, the spirits therein are interior natural. But the waters of the seas which are over the hells, are dense, black, and sometimes red; and the infernal crew therein appear like snakes and serpents, and like monsters, such as are in the seas. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 511</h4><p>511. Was cast into the sea, signifies into the natural man. This is evident from the signification of the "sea," as being the knowledge [scientificum] in general which is in the natural man, consequently the natural man in respect to its knowledge there (See above n. <a href="../ae/270.htm">270</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>). This is the signification of "sea," because "water" signifies truth, and truth in the natural man is called knowledge [scientificum]; but truth itself is in itself spiritual, and in the spiritual man makes one with the affection of truth, for it is a form of affection there; consequently so far as this affection with its form is therefrom in the knowledges that are in the natural man, so far the knowledges contain in themselves truths, and are true knowledges; for the knowledges of the natural man, viewed in themselves, are not truths, but only containing vessels of truth, therefore "vessels" in the Word signify knowledges.</p><p>[2] That the "sea" signifies the natural man can be seen from passages in the Word cited above (n. <a href="../ae/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>, which makes clear that the "sea" in reference to its water signifies knowledge [scientificum] in general, while the "sea" in reference to its waves signifies disputation and reasoning, which are maintained by knowledges; and as both knowledges and reasoning are in the natural man, therefore the "sea" signifies the natural man itself. But the state of the natural man is wholly in accordance with the affection of man's love. When spiritual affection, that is, affection of good and truth for the sake of good and truth, is dominant in man, and when this affection flows in through the spiritual into the natural man, then the natural man is a spiritual-natural man, for it is subordinate and subject to the spiritual, and as they thus act as a one, both are in heaven. But so long as a merely natural affection is dominant in man, there is in the natural man no truth, but everything therein is knowledge [scientificum] not true, it is dead knowledge and false knowledge, for the reason that the knowledges therein then conjoin themselves with affections merely natural, all of which spring from the loves of self and of the world, while truths themselves, because in themselves they are spiritual, conjoin themselves only with spiritual affections, as has been said above. When truths conjoin themselves with affections merely natural, they are no longer truths but falsities, for affection merely natural falsifies truths. Conjunctions of truth with affections merely natural correspond to whoredoms and adulteries of various kinds, and in the spiritual sense are meant in the Word by various kinds of whoredoms and adulteries. There are conjunctions of the truths of the Word with the love of self and the world that correspond to these.</p><p>[3] That the "sea" signifies the natural man with the things that are in it is also from correspondence; for in the spiritual world seas appear in various places, especially about the outmost boundaries where spiritual societies or heaven itself ends. There are seas there because in the boundaries of heaven and beyond them those dwell who have been merely natural men, and these appear there in deep places, where they have their abodes; the natural men there, however, are not evil, but the evil natural men are in the hells. The seas there seen also make evident what those are who are in them, especially from the color of the waters, as verging towards darkness or clearness; if towards darkness those therein are sensual spirits, who are the lowest natural, and if towards clearness those therein are the interior natural. But the waters of the seas that are over the hells are dense, black, and sometimes ruddy; and the infernal crew therein appear like snakes and serpents, and like such monsters as are in seas. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 511 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>511. "Missus est in mare." - Quod significet in naturalem hominem, constat ex significatione "maris", quod sit scientificum in communi quod in naturali homine, proinde naturalis homo quoad scientificum ibi (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_511/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_270" target=_top>270</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_511/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_342" target=_top>342</a> [b]). <p>Quod "mare" id significet, est quia "aqua" significat verum, et verum in naturali homine vocatur scientificum. Ipsum autem verum in se est spirituale, ac in spirituali homine unum facit cum affectione veri, est enim forma affectionis ibi; quantum itaque haec affectio cum sua forma est inde in scientificis quae in naturali homine, tantum scientifica in se continent vera et sunt scientifica vera; nam scientifica quae naturalis hominis in se spectata non sunt vera, sed modo vasa continentia veri, quare etiam per "vasa" in Verbo significantur scientifica.<p>[2] Quod naturalis homo per "mare" significetur, constare potest ex locis in Verbo supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_511/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_275" target=_top>275</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_511/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_342" target=_top>342</a> [b, c]) adductis; ex quibus patet quod per "mare" respective ad aquam significetur scientificum in communi, ac per "mare" respective ad fluctus significetur disceptatio et ratiocinatio quae fit per scientifica; et quia utrumque est in naturali homine, ideo per "mare" ipse naturalis homo significatur. Sed status naturalis hominis est prorsus secundum affectionem quae amoris hominis; quando apud hominem dominatur affectio spiritualis seu affectio boni et veri propter bonum et verum, et haec per spiritualem hominem in naturalem influit, tunc naturalis homo est spiritualis naturalis homo, est enim tunc subordinatus et subjectus spirituali, et quia sic unum agunt est uterque in caelo; at vero cum apud hominem affectio mere naturalis dominatur, tunc in naturali homine non est aliquod verum, sed omne quod ibi est scientificum non verum, scientificum mortuum et scientificum falsum; causa est, quia tunc scientifica ibi se conjungunt cum affectionibus mere naturalibus, quae omnes scaturiunt ex amoribus sui et mundi; et tamen ipsa vera, quia in se spiritualia sunt, non se conjungent nisi cum affectionibus spiritualibus, ut supra dictum est. Quando vera se conjungunt cum affectionibus mere naturalibus, tunc non amplius sunt vera, sed sunt falsa, nam affectio mere naturalis falsificat illa. Conjunctiones veri cum affectionibus mere naturalibus correspondent scortationibus et adulteriis varii generis, et quoque in sensu spirituali per varia scortationum et adulteriorum genera in Verbo intelliguntur; sunt conjunctiones veritatum Verbi cum amore sui et cum amore mundi, quae illis correspondent.<p>[3] Quod "mare" significet naturalem hominem cum illis quae inibi sunt, est quoque ex correspondentia; in mundo enim spirituali apparent variis in locis maria, imprimis circa ultimos terminos ubi desinunt societates spirituales seu ipsum caelum: quod ibi maria existant, est causa, quia in terminis caeli et extra illos sunt illi qui mere naturales homines fuerunt, qui etiam apparent inibi in fundis, ubi eorum domicilia; sed sunt ibi naturales non mali, at naturales mali sunt in infernis. Ex maribus ibi visis etiam constat quales illi sunt qui inibi, sed hoc imprimis ex aquarum colore vergente ad obscurum aut ad clarum: si ad obscurum, sunt inibi sensuales spiritus, qui sunt naturales infimi; si ad clarum sunt, inibi naturales interiores. Sed aquae marium quae super inferna sunt densae, nigrae, quandoque rubrae; et turba infernalis inibi apparet sicut angues et serpentes, et sicut monstra qualia in maribus sunt. </p>
