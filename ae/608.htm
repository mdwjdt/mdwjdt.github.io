<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 608</h4><p>608. And sware by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages.- That this signifies truth from His own Divine, is evident from the signification of swearing, as denoting asseveration and confirmation, and when stated of the Lord, as denoting truth, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of, " him that liveth unto the ages of the ages," as denoting the Divine from eternity, which alone lives, and which is the source of life to all in the universe, both to angels and men. That this is the signification of him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/289.htm">289</a>, <a href="../ae/291.htm">291</a>, <a href="../ae/349.htm">349</a>). That to swear signifies asseveration and confirmation, but, in the present case, truth, because from the angel, by whom the Lord is meant, is evident from this fact, that to swear is to assert and confirm the truth of a statement, and when done by the Lord, means Divine verity. For oaths are taken only by those who are not interiorly in truth itself, that is, by those who are not interior but only exterior men; therefore they are never taken by angels, and much less therefore by the Lord. But the reason why He is said to swear in the Word, and why the sons of Israel were allowed to swear by God, is, that they were merely exterior men, and because when the asseveration and confirmation of the internal man, comes into the external, it takes the form of an oath. And in the Israelitish church all things were external, and these represented and signified things internal. The case is similar also in regard to the Word in the sense of the letter. It is therefore evident that by the angel swearing by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, is not meant that he thus sware, but that he said in himself that it was the truth, and that this falling into the natural sphere, became, according to correspondences, changed into the form of an oath.</p><p>[2] Now because to swear is only an external act corresponding to the confirmation of the mind of the internal man, and consequently signifies it, therefore in the Word of the Old Testament it is said to be lawful to swear by God, and even God Himself is said to take an oath. That this signifies confirmation, asseveration, and the absolute truth, or that a thing is true, is evident from the following passages.<p>Thus in Isaiah:<p>"Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_8.htm">62:8</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by his soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_14.htm">51:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_6_8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>).<p>And again, in Amos:<p>"The Lord Jehovih hath sworn by his holiness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_2.htm">4:2</a>).<p>And again, in the same prophet:<p>"The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_7.htm">8:7</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, I have sworn by my great name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_26.htm">44:26</a>).<p>Jehovah swearing by His right hand, by His soul, by His holiness, and by His name, signifies by the Divine Truth; for the right hand of Jehovah, the arm of His strength, His holiness, His name, and His soul, mean the Lord as to Divine Truth, thus Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord. The signification of the excellency of Jacob is similar, for the mighty one of Jacob means the Lord as to Divine Truth.</p><p>[3] That to swear, when stated of Jehovah, signifies confirmation from Himself, or from His Divine, is evident in Isaiah:<p>"By myself have I sworn, the word has gone out of my mouth, and shall not be recalled" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_23.htm">45:23</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"I swear by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_22_5.htm">22:5</a>).<p>Because swearing, when stated of Jehovah, signifies Divine Truth, therefore it is said in David,<p>"Jehovah hath sworn in truth unto David; He will not turn from it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>).</p><p>[4] Jehovah God, or the Lord, never swears, for it does not belong to God Himself, or the Divine Truth, to swear; but when God, or the Divine Truth, wills to have anything confirmed before men, then that confirmation, passing into the natural sphere, becomes an oath or takes the solemn formula of an oath in the world. It is therefore evident, that although God never swears, yet in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the natural sense, it may be said that He swears. This therefore is the signification of swearing when stated of Jehovah or the Lord in the preceding passages, and also in the following.<p>Thus in Isaiah:<p>"Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_24.htm">14:24</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant. O Lord, thou swearest unto David in truth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_49.htm">49</a>).<p>And again:<p>"Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_110_4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>).<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>"I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_8.htm">16:8</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"Unto whom I sware in my anger" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_9.htm">54:9</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>"To remember his holy covenant; the oath which he sware to our father Abraham" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_72.htm">1:72</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_73.htm">73</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"He was mindful of his covenant which he made with Abraham, and his oath with Isaac" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_9.htm">9</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"That I may establish the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_5.htm">11:5</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_32_22.htm">32:22</a>).<p>"The land which I sware to give to your fathers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_1_35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_10_11.htm">10:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_9.htm">11:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_26_3.htm">26:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_26_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_31_20.htm">31:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_34_4.htm">34:4</a>).</p><p>[5] From these things it is evident what is meant by the angel lifting up his hand to heaven, and swearing by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages.<p>Similarly in Daniel:<p>"I heard the man (vir) clothed in linen, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and sware by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_12_7.htm">12:7</a>).<p>This signifies affirmation before the angels concerning the state of the church, that what follows is Divine Truth.</p><p>[6] Since the church instituted with the sons of Israel was a representative church, in which all things that were commanded were natural things, representing and consequently signifying spiritual things, therefore the sons of Israel, with whom the church was, were allowed to swear by Jehovah, and by His name, also by the holy things of the church, and this represented, and therefore signified, internal confirmation, and also truth. This will be evident from the following passages.<p>Thus in Isaiah:<p>"He who blesseth himself in the earth let him bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth let him swear by the God of truth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_16.htm">65:16</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"Swear by the living Jehovah, in truth, in judgment, and in justice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_2.htm">4:2</a>).<p>And in Moses:<p>"Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear in his name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_10_20.htm">10:20</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt swear to Jehovah of hosts" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_18.htm">19:18</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"If in learning they will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, Jehovah liveth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_12_16.htm">12:16</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"Every one that sweareth by" God "shall glory, but the mouth of them that speak a lie shall be stopped" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_63_11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>).<p>To swear by God, signifies to speak truth, for it follows, "but the mouth of them that speak a lie shall be stopped." That they swore by God, see also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_24.htm">24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_2_12.htm">Joshua 2:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_9_20.htm">9:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_21_7.htm">Judges 21:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_17.htm">1 Kings 1:17</a>.</p><p>[7] Since the ancients were allowed to swear by Jehovah God, it therefore follows that it is a most serious evil to swear falsely or to lie; as is evident from these passages.<p>Thus in Malachi:<p>"I will be a witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_3_5.htm">3:5</a>).<p>And in Moses:<p>"Thou shall not swear a lie by my name, so that thou profane the name of thy God," and "thou shalt not take the name of thy God in vain" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_5_11.htm">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_19_12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_4.htm">Zech. 5:4</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see if there be those that say, By the living Jehovah; surely they swear falsely. Thy sons have destroyed me, and sworn by no god" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_7.htm">7</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>"Israel, swear not, Jehovah liveth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_15.htm">4:15</a>).<p>And in Zephaniah:<p>"And I will cut off them that swear by Jehovah, and that swear by their king; and them that are turned back from Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_4.htm">1:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_6.htm">6</a>).<p>And in Zechariah:<p>"Love not the oath of a lie" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_17.htm">8:17</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which swear by the name of Jehovah, not in truth, nor in justice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_1.htm">48:1</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_24_4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>).</p><p>[8] From these passages it is clear, that the ancients, who were in the representatives and significatives of the church, were allowed to swear by Jehovah God, in order to testify truth, and by that oath it was signified that they thought what was true, and willed what was good. But it was more especially permitted to the sons of Jacob, since they were altogether natural and external men, and not internal and spiritual; and mere external or natural men desire to have the truth attested and confirmed by oaths, whereas internal or spiritual men do not desire it, yea, are averse from oaths, and account them horrible, especially those in which God and the holy things of heaven and the church are appealed to, and they are satisfied with saying and with having it said, that a thing is true, or that it is so.</p><p>[9] Since swearing is not of the internal or spiritual man, and since the Lord, when He came into the world, taught men to be internal or spiritual, and to that end afterwards abrogated the external things of the church, and opened the internal things of it, therefore he also forbad swearing by God and by the holy things of heaven and the church. This is clear from his own words in Matthew:<p>"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shall not swear, but shall perform unto the Lord thine oaths; I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne; neither by the earth; for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black" (<a href="../ae/253.htm">253</a>, <a href="../ae/462.htm">462</a>, <a href="../ae/477.htm">477</a>); the earth means the church (see above, n. <a href="../ae/29.htm">29</a>, <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>, <a href="../ae/413.htm">413</a>, <a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>), it is therefore called the footstool of God's feet (that the footstool of God's feet means the church, see above, n. <a href="../ae/606.htm">606</a>); Jerusalem means the doctrine of the church, it is therefore called the city of the great God (Dei) (that a city denotes doctrine, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>); and the head means intelligence therefrom (see above, n. <a href="../ae/553.htm">553</a>, <a href="../ae/578.htm">578</a>); it is therefore said, "thou canst not make one hair white or black," which signifies, that man can understand nothing of himself.</p><p>[10] Again, in the same Evangelist:<p>"Woe unto you, ye blind guides, because ye say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind; for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? And whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. Ye fools and blind; for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? Whosoever therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. And whosoever shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by Him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him that sitteth thereon" (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>). And the altar signifies the Lord as to Divine Good, and, in the respective sense, heaven and the church as to that good, also all worship from Divine Good (see above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>). And because by the Lord are meant all Divine things which proceed from Him, for He Himself is in them, and they are of Him, therefore he who swears by Him, swears by all things that are of Him. Similarly, he who swears by heaven and by the church, swears by all the holy things which pertain to them, for heaven embraces and contains them; and similarly the church; it is therefore said, that the temple is greater than the gold of the temple, because the temple sanctifies the gold, and that the altar is greater than the gift which is upon it, because the altar sanctifies the gift. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 608</h4><p>608. Verse 6 (<a href="../ae/289.htm">289</a>, <a href="../ae/291.htm">291</a>, <a href="../ae/349.htm">349</a>.) That "to swear" signifies asseveration and confirmation, but here verity (since it is the Lord that is meant by the angel that swears), can be seen from this, that "to swear" means to asseverate and confirm that a thing is so, and when done by the Lord means Divine verity; for oaths are made only by those who are not interiorly in truth itself, that is, by those who are not interior but only exterior men; consequently they are never made by angels, still less by the Lord; but He is said in the Word to swear, and the Israelites were allowed to swear by God, because they were only exterior men, and because the asseveration and confirmation of the internal man, when it comes into the external, falls into the form of an oath. In the Israelitish Church all things were external, representing and signifying things internal. The Word in the sense of the letter is similar. From this it can be seen that "the angel sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages" cannot mean that he thus sware, but that he said in himself that this is verity, and that when this came down into the natural sphere it was changed, according to correspondences, into the form of an oath.</p><p>[2] Now as "to swear" is only an external corresponding to the confirmation that belongs to the mind of the internal man, and is therefore significative of that, so in the Word of the Old Testament it is said to be lawful to swear by God, yea, that God Himself is said to swear. That this signifies confirmation, asseveration and simply verity, or that it is true, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah hath sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah of Hosts hath sworn by His soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_6_8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>The Lord Jehovih hath sworn by His holiness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, I have sworn by My great name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>).<p>Jehovah is said "to have sworn by His right hand," "by His soul," "by His holiness," and "by His name," to signify by Divine verity; for "the right hand of Jehovah," "the arm of His strength," "His holiness," "His name," and "His soul," mean the Lord in relation to Divine truth, thus Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; the like is meant by "the excellency of Jacob," for "the mighty One of Jacob" means the Lord in relation to Divine truth.</p><p>[3] That "to swear," in reference to Jehovah, signifies confirmation by Himself, that is, from His Divine, is evident in Isaiah:<p>By Myself have I sworn, the word has gone forth from My mouth, and shall not be recalled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_23.htm">Isaiah 14:23</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>By Myself I have sworn that this house shall become a desolation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_22_5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>).<p>Because "to swear" in reference to Jehovah signifies Divine verity it is said in David:<p>Jehovah hath sworn truth unto David, He turneth <sup>1</sup>not from it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_11.htm">Psalms 132:11</a>).</p><p>[4] Jehovah God, or the Lord, never swears, for to swear is not becoming to God Himself, or the Divine verity; but when God, or the Divine verity, wills to have anything confirmed before men, then that confirmation in its descent into the natural sphere falls into the form or formula of an oath, such as is used in the world. This shows why it is said in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the natural sense, that God swears, although He never swears. This, then, is the signification of "to swear" in reference to Jehovah or the Lord in the preceding passages, and also in the following. In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah of Hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_14_24.htm">Isaiah 14:24</a>).<p>In David:<p>I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant. Lord, Thou hast sworn unto David in verity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_3.htm">Psalms 89:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_49.htm">49</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_110_4.htm">Psalms 110:4</a>).<p>In Ezekiel:<p>I have sworn unto thee, and have entered into a covenant with thee, that thou mightest become Mine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>).<p>In David:<p>Unto whom I have sworn in Mine anger (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_95_11.htm">Psalms 95:11</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_9.htm">Isaiah 54:9</a>).<p>In Luke:<p>To remember His holy covenant, the oath which He sware to Abraham our father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_72.htm">Luke 1:72</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_73.htm">73</a>).<p>In David:<p>He hath remembered His covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath with Isaac (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_8.htm">Psalms 105:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_9.htm">9</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>That I may establish the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_32_22.htm">32:22</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>The land which I have sworn to give unto your fathers (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_1_35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_10_11.htm">10:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_9.htm">11:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_26_3.htm">26:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_26_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_31_20.htm">31:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_34_4.htm">34:4</a>).</p><p>[5] From this it can be seen what is meant by "the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages," as it is likewise said in Daniel:<p>And I heard the man clothed in linen, that he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_12_7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>);<p>as meaning to bear witness before the angels respecting the state of the church, that what follows is Divine verity.</p><p>[6] Because the church that was instituted with the sons of Israel was a representative church, in which all things that were commanded were natural things representing and signifying spiritual things, the sons of Israel, with whom that church existed, were permitted to swear by Jehovah, and by His name, likewise by the holy things of the church; and this represented and thus signified internal confirmation, and also verity, as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>He that blesseth himself in the earth let him bless himself in the God of truth, and he that sweareth in the earth let him swear in the God of truth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Swear by the living Jehovah, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, Him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear in His name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_10_20.htm">10:20</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that swear to Jehovah of Hosts (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>If in learning they will learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, Jehovah liveth! (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_12_16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>).<p>In David:<p>Everyone that sweareth by God shall glory, but the mouth of them that speak a lie shall be stopped (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_63_11.htm">Psalms 63:11</a>).<p>"To swear by God" here signifies to speak the truth, for it is added, "the mouth of them that speak a lie shall be stopped." (That they swore by God see also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_24.htm">24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_2_12.htm">Joshua 2:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_9_20.htm">9:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_21_7.htm">Judges 21:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_1_17.htm">1 Kings 1:17</a>.)</p><p>[7] As the ancients were allowed to swear by Jehovah God, it follows that it was an enormous evil to swear falsely or to swear to a lie, as is evident from these passages. In Malachi:<p>I will be a witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those that swear to a lie (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_3_5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>).<p>In Moses:<p>Thou shalt not swear to a lie by My name, so that thou profane the name of thy God; also, Thou shalt not take the name of thy God in vain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_19_12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_5_11.htm">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see whether there be any who say, By the living Jehovah; surely they swear by a lie. Thy sons have destroyed <sup>2</sup>Me, and sworn by one not God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_5_7.htm">7</a>).<p>In Hosea:<p>Israel, ye shall not swear, Jehovah liveth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>).<p>In Zephaniah:<p>I will cut off them that swear by Jehovah, and that swear by their king, and them that are turned back from following Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4-6</a>).<p>In Zechariah:<p>Love not the oath of a lie (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_8_17.htm">Zechariah 8:17</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Hear ye, O house of Jacob, who swear by the name of Jehovah, not in truth nor in righteousness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>).<p>In David:<p>The clean in hands and the pure in heart doth not lift up his soul unto vanity, nor swear with deceit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_24_4.htm">Psalms 24:4</a>).</p><p>[8] From this it can be seen that the ancients, who were in the representatives and the significatives of the church, were permitted to swear by Jehovah God in order to bear witness to the truth, and by that oath it was signified that they thought what is true and willed what is good. Especially was this granted to the sons of Jacob, because they were wholly external and natural men, and not internal and spiritual; and merely external or natural men wish to have the truth confirmed and witnessed to by oaths; but internal or spiritual men do not wish this; indeed, they turn away from oaths and shudder at them, especially those in which God and the holy things of heaven and the church are appealed to, and are content with saying and with having it said that a thing is true, or that it is so.</p><p>[9] As swearing does not belong to the internal or spiritual man, and as the Lord, when He came into the world, taught men to be internal or spiritual, and to that end abrogated the externals of the church, and opened its internals, therefore He forbade swearing by God and by the holy things of heaven and the church. This is evident from these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not swear [falsely], but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath; but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; neither by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; neither by Jerusalem, for it is a city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black (<a href="../ae/253.htm">253</a>, <a href="../ae/462.htm">462</a>, <a href="../ae/477.htm">477</a>); "the earth" means the church (See above, n. <a href="../ae/29.htm">29</a>, <a href="../ae/304.htm">304</a>, <a href="../ae/413.htm">413</a>, <a href="../ae/417.htm">417</a>), which is called therefore "the footstool of God's feet" (that "the footstool of God's feet" also means the church, see above, n. <a href="../ae/606.htm">606</a>; "Jerusalem" means the doctrine of the church, wherefore it is called "the city of the great king" (that "city" means doctrine, see above, n. <a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>; and the "head" means intelligence therefrom (See above, n. <a href="../ae/553.htm">553</a>, <a href="../ae/577.htm">577</a>), therefore it is said "thou canst not make one hair white or black," which signifies that man of himself can understand nothing.</p><p>[10] Again, in the same:<p>Woe unto you, ye blind guides, for ye say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind; for whether is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? And whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it he is a debtor. Ye fools and blind; whether is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? But whosoever sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by everything thereon. And whosoever sweareth by the temple sweareth by it and by Him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>); and the "altar" signifies the Lord in relation to Divine good, and in a relative sense heaven and the church in respect to that good, likewise all worship from Divine good (See above, n. <a href="../ae/391.htm">391</a>); and because by the Lord all Divine things that proceed from Him are meant, for He is in them and they are His, so he who swears by Him swears by all things that are His; likewise he who swears by heaven and by the church, swears by all the holy things that belong to heaven and the church, for heaven is the complex and containant of these things; so, in like manner, is the church; therefore it is said that the temple is greater than the gold of the temple, because the temple sanctifies the gold, and that the altar is greater than the gift which is upon it, because the altar sanctifies the gift.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Latin has "turneth," the Hebrew "turn back," which is found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2842.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2842</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Latin has "destroyed," the Hebrew "forsaken.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 608 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>608. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_10_6" target=_top>6</a>.] "Et juravit per Viventem in saecula saeculorum." - Quod significet veritatem ex Divino suo, constat ex significatione "jurare", quod sit asseveratio et confirmatio, et cum de Domino, quod sit veritas (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "per Viventem in saecula saeculorum", quod sit Divinum ab aeterno, quod solum vivit, et ex quo omnibus in universo tam angelis quam hominibus vita. (Quod hoc significetur per "Viventem in saecula saeculorum", videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_289" target=_top>289</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_291" target=_top>291</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_349" target=_top>349</a> [a, b] .) Quod "jurare" significet asseverationem et confirmationem, hic autem veritatem, quia ab "angelo", per quem intelligitur Dominus, constare potest ex eo, quod jurare sit asseverare et confirmare quod ita sit, et cum a Domino, quod sit Divina Veritas: juramenta enim fiunt solum ab illis qui non interius in ipsa veritate sunt; hoc est, ab illis qui non interiores sed solum exteriores homines sunt; inde nec fiunt usquam ab angelis, minus itaque a Domino; sed quod in Verbo dicatur quod juret, et quod concessum fuerit filiis Israelis jurare per Deum, est quia solum exteriores homines fuerunt, et quia asseveratio et confirmatio interni hominis, dum in externum, cadit in jurare: et in Ecclesia Israelitica omnia erant externa, quae repraesentabant et significabant interna; simile etiam est Verbum in sensu litterae. Inde constare potest quod per quod "angelus juraverit per Viventem in saecula saeculorum", non intelligendum sit quod ita juraverit, sed quod in se dixerit quod veritas sit, et quod hoc in sphaeram naturalem delapsum secundum correspondentias conversum sit in jurare.<p>[2] Nunc quia jurare est solum externum correspondens confirmationi, quae est mentis interni hominis, et inde significat illam, ideo in Verbo Veteris Testamenti dicitur quod liceat jurare per Deum, immo quod Ipse Deus juraverit: quod id significet confirmationem, asseverationem, et simpliciter veritatem, seu quod verum sit, constare potest ex sequentibus locis:<p>- Apud Esaiam,<p>"Juravit Jehovah per dextram, et per brachium roboris" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_62_8" target=_top>Esaiam 62:8</a>);<p>apud Jeremiam,<p>"Juravit Jehovah Zebaoth par animam suam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_14" target=_top>51:14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_6_8" target=_top>Amos 6:8</a>);<p>apud Amos,<p>"Juravit Dominus Jehovih per sanctitatem suam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_4_2" target=_top>4:2</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Juravit Jehovah per excellentiam Jacobi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_8_7" target=_top>8:7</a>):<p>apud Jeremiam,<p>"Ecce Ego juravi per nomen meum magnum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_44_26" target=_top>44:26</a>):<p>quod Jehovah dicatur juravisse per "dextram suam", per "animam suam", per "sanctitatem suam", et per "nomen suum", significat per Divinam Veritatem; nam per "dextram Jehovae", per "brachium roboris Ipsius", per "sanctitatem", per "nomen", et per "animam Ipsius", intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, ita Divinum Verum procedens a Domino; similiter per "excellentiam Jacobi", nam per "fortem Jacobi" intelligitur etiam Dominus quoad Divinum Verum.<p>[3] Quod "jurare", cum a Jehovah, significet confirmationem a Se seu ex suo Divino, patet apud Esaiam,<p>"Per Me juravi, exivit ex ore meo Verbum, quod non revocabitur" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_45_23" target=_top>45:23</a>);<p>et apud Jeremiam,<p>"Per Me juravi quod in desolatione futura sit domus haec" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_22_5" target=_top>22:5</a>).<p>Quia per "jurare", cum a Jehovah, significatur Divina Veritas, ideo dicitur apud Davidem,<p>"Juravit Jehovah Davidi veritatem, e qua Se non <sup>1</sup></p><p>subducit" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_11" target=_top>Psalms 132:11</a>).<p>[4] Jehovah Deus seu Dominus nunquam jurat, non enim convenit Ipsi Deo seu Divinae Veritati jurare; at cum Deus seu Divina Veritas vult aliquid coram hominibus confirmatum habere, tunc illa confirmatio, in sphaeram naturalem delapsa, in juramentum seu in juramenti formulam in mundo solennem cadit: inde patet quod tametsi Deus nusquam jurat, usque in Verbi sensu litterae, qui sensus est naturalis, dicatur quod juret. Hoc itaque significatur per "jurare", cum de Jehovah seu Domino, in locis praecedentibus, et quoque in his sequentibus:<p>- Apud Esaiam,<p>"Juravit Jehovah Zebaoth dicendo, Si non quemadmodum cogitavi, ita futurum est" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_608/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_14_24" target=_top>14:24</a>);<p>apud Davidem,<p>"Pepigi foedus Electo meo, juravi Davidi servo meo:....
