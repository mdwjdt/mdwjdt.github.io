<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1079</h4><p>1079. (Verse 16) And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast. That this signifies the truths of the church from the Word, with the Reformed, especially concerning the Lord's Divine power, and concerning the Divine sanctity of the Word, is evident from the signification of the ten horns upon the beast, as denoting the truths of the church from the Word; concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/1069.htm">1069</a>). That horns denote truths as to power, see n. <a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>, <a href="../ae/567.htm">567</a>, <a href="../ae/776.htm">776</a>, <a href="../ae/1041.htm">1041</a>. And that the beast is the Word (n. <a href="../ae/1038.htm">1038</a>). That the ten horns of the beast here signify the truths of the Word as to power, with the Reformed, is evident from its being said further in these two verses, that they shall hate the whore, shall make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire; by which is signified the total rejection of all the statutes and edicts of the Pope; thus, of the falsifications and profanations of which they consist; especially the two which are treated of above, concerning the power over the holy things of the church, and over the souls of men to save them, which is called the power of opening and shutting heaven; also, concerning the power of interpreting the Word, and of altering those things therein in order to favour their own dominion; these being the two heads of their religion, which the Reformed have altogether rejected and burned with fire.<p>That this secession is described in this and the following verse, is evident from the series of things in the internal sense. For in verses 12-14 the subject treated of is concerning those within Babylon who have rejected those two profane dogmas; and in these two verses concerning those outside Babylon who have rejected them, and concerning the rest of their profane [principles], in verse 15.<p>That this is so is clearly evident, when by the beast is understood the Word, the truths thereof by the horns of the beast, and the profane Babylonish [principles] by the whore.<p>Continuation concerning the Word:-</p><p>[2] The Word in the literal sense appears for the most part to be simple, but still the wisdom of the three heavens is stored up in it; for in each particular therein there is a sense more and more interior. The interior is such as it is in the first heaven; a still more interior, such as it is in the second heaven; and an inmost, such as it is in the third. These senses are in the sense of the letter, one within the other; and are thence unfolded one after the other, each from its own heaven, while a man who is led of the Lord reads it. These interior senses differ in the degree of light and wisdom according to the heavens, still they make one by influx, and thence by correspondences. But how they thus make one shall be told in what follows.<p>From these considerations it is clear how the Word is inspired by the Divine, and that it is written from such inspiration that no other can at all be compared to it. The arcana of wisdom of the three heavens that are therein are the mystical things of which many have spoken. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1079</h4><p>1079. Verse 16. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, signifies the truths of the church from the Word with the Reformed, especially respecting the Lord's Divine authority and the Divine holiness of the Word. This is evident from the signification of "the ten horns upon the beast," as being the truths of the church from the Word (See above, n. <a href="../ae/106.htm">106</a>9; that "horns" mean truths as to power, see n. <a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>, <a href="../ae/567.htm">567</a>, <a href="../ae/776.htm">776</a>, <a href="../ae/1041.htm">1041</a>; and that the "beast" means the Word, n. <a href="../ae/1038.htm">1038</a>). That "the ten horns of the beast" signify here the truths of the Word as to power with the Reformed, is evident from what is said in these two verses, namely, that "they shall hate the harlot, shall make her desolate and naked, shall eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire," which signifies they have altogether rejected all the statutes and decrees of the Pope, thus his falsifications and profanations, especially the two treated of above, namely, respecting his authority over the holy things of the church and over the souls of men to save them, which is called the authority to open and shut heaven, also respecting the authority to interpret the Word, and to change things in it to favor his own dominion; these being the two heads of their religion which the Reformed have wholly rejected and burned with fire. That this recession is described in this and the following verse can be seen from the series of things in the internal sense; for verses 12-14 treat of those within Babylon who have rejected those two profane dogmas, while these two verses treat of those outside of Babylon who have rejected them, and the rest of their profanations are treated of in verse 15. That this is so is clearly evident when the Word is meant by "beast," its truths by "the horns of the beast," and the Babylonish profanations by the "harlot."<p>(Continuation respecting the Word)</p><p>[2] The Word in the sense of the letter appears very simple, and yet there is stored up in it the wisdom of the three heavens, for each least particular of it contains interior and more interior senses; an interior sense such as exists in the first heaven, a still more interior sense such as exists in the second heaven, and an inmost sense such as exists in the third heaven. These senses are in the sense of the letter, one within the other, and are evolved therefrom one after the other, each from its own heaven, when a man who is led by the Lord reads the Word. These interior senses differ in the degree of light and wisdom according to the heavens, and yet they make one by influx, and thus by correspondences. How they thus make one shall be told in what follows. All this makes clear how the Word was inspired by the Divine, and that it was written from such an inspiration to which nothing else in the world can in anywise be compared. The arcana of wisdom of the three heavens contained in it are the mystical things of which many have spoken. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1079 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1079. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_16" target=_top>16</a>.] "Et decem cornua quae vidisti super bestia." - Quod significet vera ecclesiae ex Verbo apud Reformatos, imprimis de Divina potestate Domini, et de Divina sanctitate Verbi constat ex significatione "decem cornuum super bestia", quod sint vera ecclesiae ex Verbo; (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1069" target=_top>1069</a>; quod "cornua" sint vera quoad potentiam [videatur supra] , n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_316" target=_top>316</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_567" target=_top>567</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_776" target=_top>776</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1041" target=_top>1041</a>; et quod "bestia" sit Verbum, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1079/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1038" target=_top>1038</a>); quod hic "decem cornua bestiae" significent vera Verbi quoad potentiam apud Reformatos, con stat ex illis quae in binis his versibus dicuntur, nempe quod "odio habebunt meretricem, devastatam facient illam et nudam, carnes ejus comedent, et illam comburent igne", per quae significatur quod prorsus rejecturi sint omnia statuta et edicta papae, ita falsificata et profanata ejus, praecipue duo illa de quibus supra actum est, nempe de potestate super sancta ecclesiae, super animas hominum ad salvandum illos (quae vocatur potestas aperiendi et claudendi caelum), tum de potestate interpretandi Verbum, et immutandi illa quae ibi ad favorem sui dominii; quae duo sunt religionis eorum capita, quae Reformati prorsus rejecerunt et combusserunt igne. Quod haec recessio in hoc et in sequenti versu describatur, ex serie rerum in sensu interno constare potest; nam in versibus 12-14 actum est de illis qui duo illa dogmata profana rejecerunt intra Babyloniam, et in his binis versibus, de illis qui ea rejecerunt extra Babyloniam, et de reliquis profanis agitur in versu 15. Quod ita sit manifeste patet, dum Verbum intelligitur per "bestiam", vera ejus per "cornua bestiae", et profana Babylonica per "meretricem."<p>[2] (Continuatio de Verbo.)<p>Verbum in sensu litterae apparet perquam simplex, sed usque in eo recondita est sapientia trium caelorum; inest enim singulis ibi sensus interior et interior; interior qualis est in primo caelo, adhuc interior qualis est in secundo, ac intimus qualis est in tertio: hi sensus insunt sensui litterae, unus intra alterum, et evolvitur inde unus post alterum, quisque a suo caelo, dum homo, qui ducitur a Domino, illud legit. Hi sensus interiores differunt gradu lucis et sapientiae secundum caelos, sed tamen unum faciunt per influxum, et inde correspondentias; Verum quomodo ita unum faciunt, in sequentibus dicetur. Ex his patet quomodo Verbum inspiratum est a Divino, et quod illud ex tali inspiratione sit scriptum cui aliud in mundo nullatenus comparari potest. Arcana sapientiae trium caelorum, quae in illo, sunt mystica, de quibus plures loquuntur. </p>
