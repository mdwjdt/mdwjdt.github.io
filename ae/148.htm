<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 148</h4><p>148. And in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. That this signifies the state of the interior life, which is unknown to all but those who are in it, is evident from the signification of name, as denoting quality of state (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1754.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1754</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3237.htm">3237</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3421.htm">3421</a>). Here it denotes the quality of the state of the interior life, because it is called a new name which no one knoweth saving he that receiveth it; for the quality of this state of the life is entirely unknown to those who are not in it. Those are in the interior state of life who are in love to the Lord, and none are in love to the Lord but those who acknowledge the Divine in His Human. (That to love the Lord is to live according to His precepts, may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10143.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10143</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10153.htm">10153</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10578.htm">10578</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10645.htm">10645</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10829.htm">10829</a>.) Interior life is the spiritual life in which the angels of heaven are, but exterior life is the natural life in which are all those who are not in heaven. With those also who live according to the precepts of the Lord, and acknowledge the Divine in His Human, the interior mind is opened, and they then become spiritual; but those who do not thus live, nor thus acknowledge, remain natural. (That the state of the interior or spiritual life is unknown to all those who are not in heavenly love, may be seen in the work, <a href="../hh/395.htm">Heaven and Hell 395-414</a>, and in <a href="../njhd/105.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 105</a>, <a href="../njhd/238.htm">238</a>.)</p><p>[2] That name in the Word signifies quality of state is evident from many passages, some of which shall here be adduced by way of confirmation. Thus in Isaiah:<p>"Lift up your eyes on high, and see; Who hath created these things? he who leadeth out the host in number; he called them all by name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_26.htm">40:26</a>).<p>His calling them all by name, denotes that He knows the qualities of all, and gives to them according to their state of love and faith. And in John:<p>"He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">10:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_3.htm">3</a>).<p>Similarly, in Isaiah:<p>"Thus saith Jehovah thy creator, O Jacob, and thy former, O Israel, Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by name, thou art mine" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">43:1</a>).<p>Again:<p>"That thou mayest know that I am Jehovah, who had called thee by thy name. For Jacob, my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have called thee by thy name, though thou hast not known me." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_3.htm">45:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_4.htm">4</a>).<p>I have called thee by thy name, denotes that he knew the quality of the state of the church; for Jacob and Israel are the church, Jacob the external church, and Israel the internal church.</p><p>[3] Again, in the same prophet:<p>O Israel, "if thou hadst hearkened to my commandments, thy name should not have been cut off nor destroyed before me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_19.htm">48:19</a>).<p>Cutting off and destroying the name before Jehovah, denotes the quality of the state by which conjunction is effected; this is the spiritual state of those who belong to the church which is signified by Israel. In the same:<p>"Jehovah hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother hath he remembered my name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">49:1</a>).<p>Here remembered my name, denotes to know the quality. In the same:<p>"For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest. And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall utter" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">62:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_2.htm">2</a>).<p>Again, in the same prophet:<p>"He shall call his servants by another name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_15.htm">65:15</a>).<p>To call by a new name, and by another name, denotes to give another state of life, namely, a state of spiritual life. And in Ezekiel:<p>"The city of bloods, polluted by name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_22_2.htm">22:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_22_5.htm">5</a>).<p>The city of bloods, denotes doctrine which offers violence to the good of charity, which is said to be polluted by name, when it abounds with falsities and thence with evils, which constitute its quality.</p><p>[4] And in Moses:<p>"Moses said unto Jehovah, Thou hast said, I know thee by name. And Jehovah said unto Moses, This word also which thou hast spoken I will do, for I have known thee by name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_17.htm">17</a>).<p>That He knew Moses by name, denotes that He knew his quality. And in the Apocalypse:<p>"Thou hast a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, and I will confess his name before my Father. Him that overcometh, I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, and my new name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_4.htm">3:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>).<p>That name here signifies quality of state as to the good of love and truth of faith is evident. And in another place,<p>"whose names are not written in the book of life" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Apoc. 13:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>).<p>The names written in the book of life, are all things of a man's love and faith, thus all things of his spiritual life as to their quality. Again:<p>"They shall see the face" of God and the Lamb, "and his name shall be in their foreheads" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Apoc. 22:4</a>).</p><p>[5] His name being in their foreheads, denotes a state of love; for the forehead corresponds to love, and hence signifies love. The reason why name in the Word signifies the quality of the state of man is, that in the spiritual world each one is named according to the state of life in which he is, thus variously. For spiritual speech is not like human speech; all things there are expressed according to ideas of things and of persons; and those ideas fall into words or expressions. (This will be more evident from what is shown concerning the speech of the angels of heaven, in the work, <a href="../hh/234.htm">Heaven and Hell 234-245</a>. Moreover it may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a> and <a href="../ae/135.htm">135</a>, where it is shown what the name of Jehovah, of the Lord, and of Jesus Christ, in the Word signifies.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 148</h4><p>148. And upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth except he that receiveth, signifies a state of interior life unknown to all except those who are in it. This is evident from the signification of "name," as being the quality of state (of which see Arcana C (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1754.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1754</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3237.htm">3237</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3421.htm">3421</a>); here the quality of the state of the interior life, because it is said "a new name, which no one knoweth except he that receiveth," for the quality of the state of the interior life is wholly unknown to those who are not in the interior life. Those are in the interior life who are in love to the Lord, and none are in love to the Lord except those who acknowledge the Divine in His Human (that to love the Lord is to live according to His precepts, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10143.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10143</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10153.htm">10153</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10578.htm">10578</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10645.htm">10645</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10829.htm">10829</a>). Interior life is the spiritual life, in which the angels of heaven are; but the exterior life is the natural life, in which are all who are not in heaven. With those, moreover, who live according to the precepts of the Lord and acknowledge the Divine in His Human, the interior mind is opened, and man then becomes spiritual; but those who do not so live, and do not acknowledge the Lord, remain natural. (That to all who are not in heavenly love the state of the interior or spiritual life is unknown, see in the work on <a href="../hh/395.htm">Heaven and Hell 395-414</a>; and in <a href="../njhd/105.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 105</a>, <a href="../njhd/238.htm">238</a>.)</p><p>[2] That "name" in the Word signifies quality of state is evident from many passages there, some of which I will here cite in confirmation. Thus in Isaiah:<p>Lift up your eyes on high and see; who hath created these? He that leadeth out the host in number; that calleth them all by name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>).<p>"His calling them all by name" is knowing the quality of all, and giving to them according to the state of love and faith with them. In John the meaning is similar:<p>He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_2.htm">John 10:2-3</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>Thus saith Jehovah thy Creator, O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel, Fear not; for I have redeemed thee, and have called thee by name; thou art Mine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p>In the same:<p>That thou mayest know that I am Jehovah, who had called thee by thy name. For Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel My chosen, I have called thee by thy name, when thou didst not know Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_3.htm">Isaiah 45:3-4</a>).<p>"I have called thee by thy name" means that He knew the quality of the state of the church; for "Jacob" and "Israel" are the church, "Jacob" the external church, and "Israel" the internal.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>Israel, if thou hadst hearkened to My commandments, his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_18.htm">Isaiah 48:18-19</a>).<p>"The name being cut off and destroyed from before Jehovah" denotes the quality of the state by which conjunction is effected, which state is the spiritual state of him who is of the church signified by "Israel." Again in the same prophet:<p>Jehovah hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother doth He make mention of my name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>).<p>here "making mention of the name" is knowing the quality. In the same:<p>For Zion's sake I will not be still, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet. And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall utter (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_2.htm">2</a>).<p>In the same:<p>He shall call His servants by another name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>).<p>"To call by a new name," and "by another name," is to bestow another state of life, namely, a state of spiritual life. In Ezekiel:<p>The city of bloods, polluted by name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_22_2.htm">Ezekiel 22:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_22_5.htm">5</a>).<p>"The city of bloods" is the doctrine that offers violence to the good of charity; this is said to be "polluted by name" when it abounds with falsities and evils therefrom, which constitute its quality.</p><p>[4] In Moses:<p>Moses said unto Jehovah, Thou hast said, I know thee by thy name. And Jehovah said unto Moses, This word also that thou hast spoken I will do, for I know thee by name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_17.htm">17</a>).<p>"His knowing Moses by name" is knowing his quality. In Revelation:<p>Thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white garments, and I will confess his name before My Father. He that overcometh, I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, and My new name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>).<p>It can be seen that "name" here signifies the quality of state in respect to the good of love and the truth of faith. In another place:<p>Whose names have not been written in the book of life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>).<p>"Names written in the book of life" are the quality of all things of man's love and faith, the all things of his spiritual life. In another place:<p>They shall see the face of God and the Lamb, and His name shall be in their forehead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p>"His name in their forehead" is a state of love, for "forehead" corresponds to love, and therefore signifies love.</p><p>[5] "Name" in the Word signifies the quality of man's state, because in the spiritual world each one is named according to the state of life in which he is, thus variously; for spiritual speech is not like human speech; all things there are expressed according to ideas of things and of persons; and these ideas fall into words.
