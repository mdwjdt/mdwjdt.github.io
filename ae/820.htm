<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 820</h4><p>820. Whereas in a preceding article (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_5_37.htm">5:37</a>).</p><p>[2] And because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the primary thing of the church, therefore Peter was first called by Andrew his brother, and afterwards James and John, as is clear in Matthew:<p>"Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_18.htm">4:18-20</a>).<p>In John:<p>Andrew "findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. Therefore he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a stone" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_41.htm">1:41-43</a>).<p>And in Mark:<p>"Jesus goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would, first Simon, and surnamed him Peter; afterwards James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_3_13.htm">3:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_3_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_3_17.htm">17</a>).<p>The reason why Peter was the first of the apostles, was, because truth from good is the primary thing of the church. For a man does not know from the world anything about heaven and hell, nor a life after death, nor even about God. His natural light (lumen) teaches nothing but what has entered by the eyes, thus, nothing but what relates to self and the world. His life also is therefrom; and so long as he remains only in these things, he is in hell. In order, therefore, that he may be withdrawn from them, and be led to heaven, it is necessary for him to learn truths, which not only teach that there is a God, that there are a heaven and a hell, and a life after death, but also teach the way to heaven. It is therefore evident that truth is the primary thing by which the church is formed in a man; but truth from good. For truth without good is only a knowledge that a thing is so. And mere knowledge has no other effect than to render a man capable of becoming a church. But this is not brought about until he lives according to knowledges, in which case truth is conjoined to good, and man is introduced into the church. Truths also teach how a man ought to live, and when he is affected with them for their own sake, that is, when he loves to live according to them, then he is led of the Lord, and conjunction is afforded him with heaven and he becomes spiritual, and, after death, an angel of heaven. Nevertheless, it is to be observed that truths do not produce those effects, but good by means of truths; and good is from the Lord.</p><p>[3] Because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the primary thing of the church, therefore Peter was first called, and was the first of the apostles, and was also named by the Lord Cephas, meaning a rock (petra); but, that it might be the name of a person, he is called Peter (Petrus); for by rock, in the highest sense, is signified the Lord as to Divine truth, or Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and therefore, in the relative sense, by rock is signified truth from good, which is from the Lord, the same as by Peter. That rock signifies such things (see above, n. <a href="../ae/411.htm">411</a>). What Simon son of Jona signifies, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/443.htm">443</a>).</p><p>[4] The reason why these three apostles were fishermen, and why the Lord said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men, was that to fish signifies to instruct natural men; for there were at that time, as well within as without the church, natural men, who, according as they received the Lord, and received truths from Him, became spiritual. From these things it may be concluded what is signified by the Lord's words to Peter concerning the keys; as in Matthew:<p>When some said that Jesus was John the Baptist, others Elias, others Jeremias, or another of the prophets, Jesus said to the disciples, "But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven" (<a href="../lj/57.htm">Last Judgment 57</a>).</p><p>[5] Because Peter signified truth from good, which is from the Lord, and thence also doctrine, and so represented those who are in truths from good, and in the doctrine of genuine truth from the Lord; and because these are they who instruct others, and who are instructed by the Lord; therefore Peter so often spoke with the Lord, and was also instructed by Him. He spoke with the Lord at His transfiguration,<p>Concerning the making of three tabernacles (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2-8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_26.htm">Luke 9:26-36</a>),<p>on which occasion the Lord represented the Word, which is Divine truth; and by tabernacles is signified the worship of the Lord from the good of love, and the truths therefrom (see above concerning the transfiguration of the Lord, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_67.htm">John 6:67-69</a>).<p>He was instructed by the Lord,<p>About charity, that a brother was to be forgiven as often as he sinned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_21.htm">Matthew 18:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_22.htm">22</a>);<p>About regeneration, which is signified by him who is once washed not having need to be washed except as to his feet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_3.htm">John 13:3-6</a>);<p>About the power of truth from good from the Lord, which is meant by the power of those who have the faith of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_21.htm">Mark 11:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_24.htm">24</a>);<p>About sins, that they are remitted to those who are in faith from love (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_40.htm">Luke 7:40-48</a>);<p>About men who are spiritual, as being free; and those who are natural, as being servants; by which Peter was instructed when he took the piece of money out of the mouth of a fish, and gave it for tribute; for by a fish is signified the natural man, and the same by one that pays tribute (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>).<p>Besides several other things (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_14_26.htm">Matthew 14:26-31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_27.htm">19:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_28.htm">Mark 10:28</a> and following; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_3.htm">13:3</a> and following; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_7.htm">16:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_8.htm">Luke 22:8</a> and following; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_12.htm">24:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_33.htm">33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_10.htm">John 18:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_3.htm">20:3-8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_21_1.htm">21:1-11</a>).</p><p>[6] Since those who are in truths from the good of love to the Lord, or in doctrine from them, were represented by Peter, and they are those who instruct others, therefore the Lord said to Peter, when he answered that he loved Him, that he should feed His lambs and sheep, concerning which is it thus written in John:<p>"After they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon [son of] Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; Thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; Thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon [son of] Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_21_15.htm">21:15-17</a>).<p>From these words it is quite clear, that Peter represented truth from the good of love to the Lord. Wherefore also he was now called Simon, son of Jonas; for by Simon, son of Jonas, is signified faith from charity - Simon signifying hearkening and obedience, and Jonas a dove, by which is signified charity.<p>That those who are in the doctrine of truth from love to the Lord are to instruct those who will belong to the Lord's Church is meant by the Lord's question, "Lovest thou me?" and by His saying afterwards, "Feed my lambs, and my sheep." Not that Peter only was to instruct, but all those represented by Peter; who, as was said above, are those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in truths from the Lord. By Peter's being questioned three times is signified the full time of the church from its beginning to its end. For the number three has this signification. Wherefore, when he was questioned the third time, it is said that Peter was grieved. And because the third questioning signified the end of the church, therefore these words of the Lord to Peter immediately follow:</p><p>[7] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch forth thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; which also leaned on his breast at supper. Peter, seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that this disciple should not die. Yet Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" (<a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>, <a href="../ae/637.htm">637</a>). And to walk signifies to live according to them, as may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/97.htm">97</a>). Hence to gird himself and walk whither he would, signifies to exercise free circumspection, and to see truths, and do them. But to stretch forth the hands, signifies not to be in that freedom; for the hands signify the power of truth from the understanding and perception thereof; and to stretch forth the hands, signifies not to have that power, nor thence the liberty of thinking and seeing truth. Another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not, signifies to acknowledge for truth what another dictates, and not to see for himself, as is the case at this day with the religion of faith alone. Hence, then, this faith also is meant by Peter. Therefore it is said, that Peter turning about saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following, and said of him, "But what shall this man do?" Also that Jesus said to Peter, "What is that to thee?" By the disciple following Jesus, is signified goods of life, which are good works; that these should not perish to the end of life, is signified by the words following.</p><p>[8] From these things it is evident, that by Peter is also signified faith separate from charity, as also when,<p>"He denied the Lord thrice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_69.htm">Matthew 26:69-75</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_29.htm">Mark 14:29-31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_66.htm">66-72</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_33.htm">Luke 22:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_50.htm">50</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_55.htm">55-62</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_36.htm">John 13:36-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_16.htm">18:16-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_25.htm">25-27</a>).<p>Also,<p>"When the Lord turning away from Peter, said to him, Get thee behind me, Satan. Thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest not the things which are of God, but those that be of men" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_21.htm">Matthew 16:21-23</a>).<p>And when the Lord said to him,<p>"Simon, Simon, lo, Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>).<p>All these things have been adduced that it may be known, that by Peter, in the representative sense, in the Evangelists, is signified truth from good, which is from the Lord; also faith from charity; and, in the opposite sense, truth separate from good, which in itself is falsity; also faith separate from charity, which in itself is not faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 820</h4><p>820. As it was shown in a preceding article (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_5_37.htm">Mark 5:37</a>).</p><p>[2] And as truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, Peter was the first to be called by his brother Andrew, and afterwards James and John were called, as is evident in Matthew:<p>Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. And He said unto them, Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men. And straightway leaving their nets they followed Him (<a href="../ae/411.htm">411</a>. But what "Simon son of Jonah" signifies see also above, n. <a href="../ae/443.htm">443</a>.</p><p>[3] These three apostles were fishermen, and the Lord said unto them, "Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men," because "to fish" signifies to instruct natural men; for there were at that time, both within the church and outside of it, natural men who became spiritual as they received the Lord and received truths from Him.</p><p>[4] From this the signification of the Lord's words to Peter concerning the keys may be deduced; as in Matthew:<p>When some had said that Jesus was John the Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah or another of the prophets, Jesus said to the disciples, But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I say also unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_14.htm">Matthew 16:14-19</a>).<p>This was said by the Lord to Peter because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, and this was what Peter signified; and this was said when he acknowledged the Lord to be the Messiah or the Christ, and to be the Son of the living God; for without such an acknowledgment truth is not truth, because truth derives its origin, essence, and life from good, and good from the Lord. Because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, therefore the Lord says, "upon this rock will I build My church." It has been said just above that "Peter" or "Rock" signifies in the highest sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and in a relative sense truth from good, which is from the Lord. That "the gates of hell shall not prevail" signifies that falsities from evil, which are from the hells, will not dare to rise up against those of the church who are in truths from good from the Lord, "the gates of hell" signifying all things of hell, for there are gates to all the hells through which falsities from evil exhale and rise up. "The keys of the heavens" signify the introduction into heaven of all those who are in truths from good from the Lord; "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens," signifies that heaven is opened by the Lord to those who are in truths from good from Him; and that it is closed to those who are not. These things were said to Peter; but because "Peter" means truth from good, which is from the Lord, they were said of the Lord, who is the source of good and its truth; and this is why they were said when Peter acknowledged the Lord to be the Messiah or the Christ, and the Son of the living God. Moreover, as soon as good is implanted in truths with man he is conjoined with the angels; but so long as good is not implanted in truths with man heaven is closed to him; for he then has evil in place of good, and falsities in place of truths. From this it is clear how sensuously those think who attribute such authority to Peter, when yet such authority belongs to the Lord alone.</p><p>[5] That "Peter" signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, has been made manifest to me from heaven, as may be seen in the work on The Last Judgement (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2-8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_26.htm">Luke 9:26-36</a>).<p>The Lord then represented the Word, which is Divine truth; and "tabernacles" signify the worship of the Lord from the good of love and truths therefrom. (See above concerning the Lord's transfiguration, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_67.htm">John 6:67-69</a>).<p>He was taught by the Lord:<p>Respecting charity, that a brother must be forgiven as often as he sinned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_21.htm">Matthew 18:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_22.htm">22</a>).<p>Respecting regeneration, which is signified by the one who having once bathed has no need except to wash his feet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_10.htm">John 13:10</a>);<p>Respecting the power of truth from good from the Lord, which is meant by the power of those who have the faith of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_21.htm">Mark 11:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_24.htm">24</a>);<p>Respecting sins, that they are forgiven to those who are in faith from love (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_40.htm">Luke 7:40-48</a>);<p>Respecting men who are spiritual, as being free; and those who are natural, as being servants, about which Peter was taught when he took the stater out of the mouth of a fish and gave it for tribute (a fish signifying the natural man, as likewise one that pays tribute. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>); as well as many other things (respecting which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_14_26.htm">Matthew 14:26-31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_28.htm">28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_28.htm">Mark 10:28</a>, seq.; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>, seq.; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>, seq.; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_33.htm">33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_10.htm">8:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_3.htm">20:3-8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_21_1.htm">21:1-11</a>).</p><p>[6] It was because Peter represented those who are in truths from the good of love to the Lord, or in doctrine from truths, and these are they who instruct others, that the Lord said to Peter when he replied that he loved Him, that "he should feed His lambs and sheep," respecting which in John:<p>When they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My lambs. He saith to him again, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou Me? And he saith unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed My sheep (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_21_15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p>From this it is clearly evident that Peter represented truth from the good of love to the Lord, and this is why he was now called Simon son of Jonas, for "Simon son of Jonas" signifies faith from charity; "Simon" signifies hearkening and obedience, and "Jonas" means a dove, which signifies charity. That those who are in the doctrine of truth from love to the Lord are to instruct those who will be of the Lord's church is meant by the Lord's asking, "Lovest thou Me?" and afterwards by "Feed My lambs" and "My sheep." Not that Peter only would instruct, but all those who were represented by Peter, who, as has been said, are those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in truths from the Lord. Peter was asked three times to signify the full time of the church from its beginning to its end, for this is the signification of "three;" so when he was asked the third time it is said that "Peter was grieved."</p><p>[7] And as the third asking signified the end of the church, therefore these words of the Lord to Peter immediately follow in John:<p>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast younger thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not. And when He had thus spoken He saith unto him, Follow Me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; which also leaned on His breast at supper. Peter, seeing then, <sup>1</sup>saith to Jesus, Lord, but what about this one? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me. This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus said not unto him that he should not die, but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? (<a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>, <a href="../ae/637.htm">637</a>), and "to walk" signifying to live according to truths (See above, n. <a href="../ae/97.htm">97[1-2]</a>); consequently "to gird himself and walk whither he would" signifies to consider freely and to see truths, and do them; while "to stretch forth the hands" signifies not to be in such freedom; for "the hands" signify the power of truth from the understanding and perception of it, and "to stretch forth the hands" signifies not to have that power, thus neither the freedom to think and to see truth. "Another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not," signifies to acknowledge as truths what another dictates, and what one does not see for oneself, as is done at this day with the religion of faith alone. This faith is what is now meant by "Peter," and therefore it is said that Peter turning about saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, and said of him, "But what about this one?" likewise that Jesus said to Peter, "What is that to thee?" "The disciple following Jesus" signifies the goods of life, which are good works; and that these will not perish to the end of life is signified by the words that here follow.</p><p>[8] From this it can now be seen that "Peter" signifies also faith separated from charity, as also when:<p>Peter thrice denied the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_69.htm">Matthew 26:69-75</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_29.htm">Mark 14:29-31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_66.htm">66-72</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_33.htm">Luke 22:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_50.htm">50</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_55.htm">55-62</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_36.htm">John 13:36-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_16.htm">18:16-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_25.htm">25-27</a>).<p>Also when the Lord, turning away from Peter, said to him, Get thee behind Me, Satan, thou art a stumbling-block unto Me; for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_21.htm">Matthew 16:21-23</a>).<p>Also when the Lord said to him, Simon, Simon, Behold Satan demanded you that he might sift you as wheat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>).<p>All these things have been cited to make known that "Peter" in the representative sense signifies in the Gospels truth from good, which is from the Lord; also faith from charity; and also in the contrary sense truth separated from good, which in itself is falsity; also faith separated from charity, which in itself is not faith.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "tunc" for "hunc," "then" for "him." </p>

Ut autem inde abducatur, et perducatur ad caelum, necessarium est ut discat vera, quae non solum doceant quod Deus sit, quod caelum et infernum sint, quodque vita post mortem sit, sed etiam doceant viam ad caelum. Inde constare potest quod verum sit primum, per quod homini est ecclesia; sed verum ex bono; nam verum absque bono est modo cognitio quod ita sit, et sola cognitio non aliud facit quam ut homo possit fieri ecclesia; sed non fit priusquam vivit secundum cognitiones; tunc conjungitur verum bono, ac homo introducitur in ecclesiam: vera etiam docent quomodo homo victurus est; et quando tunc afficitur veris propter vera, quod fit quando amat vivere secundum illa, tunc ducitur a Domino, et datur ei conjunctio cum caelo, et fit spiritualis, et post mortem angelus caeli. Sed usque sciendum est quod vera non producant illa, sed bonum per vera, ac bonum est a Domino. Quoniam verum ex bono, quod a Domino, est primum ecclesiae, ideo Petrus primum vocatus est, ac primus apostolorum fuit; nominatus etiam est a Domino "Kephas", quod est Petra; sed ut esset nomen personae, dicitur Petrus. Per "Petram" in supremo sensu significatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, seu Divinum Verum procedens a Domino; inde in sensu respectivo per "petram" significatur verum ex bono quod a Domino; simile per "Petrum." <p>(Quod "petra" significet illa, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_411" target=_top>411</a>; quid autem "Simon Jonae" significat, videatur etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_443" target=_top>443</a> [a] .)<p>[3] Quod tres illi apostoli piscatores fuerint, et quod dictum sit illis, "Venite post Me, et faciam vos piscatores hominum, erat quia "piscari significat instruere naturales homines; erant enim eo tempore tam intra ecclesiam, quam extra illam, naturales homines, qui sicut receperunt Dominum, et receperunt vera ab Ipso, facti sunt spirituales.<p>[4] Ex his concludi potest quid significant haec quae a Domino ad Petrum de "clavibus" dicta sunt; quae ita leguntur apud Matthaeum,<p>Cum dixerunt quidam Jesum esse Johannem Baptistam, alii Eliam, alii, Jeremiam, vel alium prophetarum, dixit Jesus discipulis, "Vos vero, quid Me dicitis esse? Respondens..Simon Petrus, dixit, Tu es Christus, ille Filius Dei viventis: et respondens Jesus dixit.., Beatus es, Simon fili Jonae, quia caro et sanguis non revelavit tibi, sed Pater meus qui est in caelis: quin immo vero tibi dico, Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam, et portae inferni non praevalebunt illi: et dabo tibi claves regni caelorum; et quicquid ligaveris in terra, erit ligatum in caelis, et quicquid solveris in terra, erit solutum in caelis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_14-19" target=_top>16:14-19</a>).<p>Quoniam verum ex bono, quod a Domino, est primum ecclesiae, et illud per "Petrum" significabatur, ideo haec a Domino dicta sunt ad Petrum, et tunc dicta quando ille agnovit Dominum pro Messia seu Christo, et pro Filio Dei viventis: nam absque illa agnitione verum non est verum, nam verum suam originem, essentiam et vitam ducit a bono, ac bonum a Domino. Quoniam verum a bono, quod a Domino, est primum ecclesiae, ideo dicit Dominus, "Super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam": quod per "Petrum" seu "Petram" in supremo sensu significetur Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, et in sensu respectivo verum a bono, quod a Domino, mox supra dictum est: quod portae inferni non praevaliturae sint, significat quod falsa ex malo, quae ex infernis, non hiscent exsurgere contra illos qui ab ecclesia in veris ex bono a Domino sunt: per "portas inferni" significantur omnia inferni, quibus omnibus sunt portae, per quas falsa ex malo exhalantur et exsurgunt: per "claves caelorum" significatur intromissio in caelum omnibus illis qui in veris ex bono a Domino sunt: "quicquid ligaveris in terra erit ligatum in caelis, et quicquid solveris in terra erit solutum in caelis", significat quod a Domino caelum aperiatur illis qui in veris ex bono ab Ipso sunt, et quod claudatur illis qui non sunt. Haec dicta sunt ad Petrum, sed quia per "Petrum" intelligitur verum ex bono quod a Domino, haec de Domino dicta sunt, a quo bonum et inde verum; quare tunc dicta sunt quando Petrus agnovit Dominum pro Messia seu Christo, proque Filio Dei viventis ut primum etiam implantatum est bonum veris apud hominem, conjungitur ille angelis; quamdiu autem bonum non implantatum est veris apud hominem, tamdiu caelum ei clausum est; nam tunc pro bono ei est malum, et pro veris sunt falsa. Ex his patet quam sensualiter cogitant qui Petro illam potestatem attribuant, cum tamen illa potestas est solius Domini.<p>[5] Quod per "Petrum" significetur verum ex bono quod a Domino, e caelo manifestatum sit, videatur in opusculo De Ultimo Judicio (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_57" target=_top>57</a>). Quoniam "Petrus" significabat verum ex bono quod a Domino, et inde quoque doctrinam, et sic repraesentabat illos qui in veris ex bono, et in doctrina genuini veri a Domino sunt, et quoniam hi sunt qui alios instruunt et qui a Domino instruuntur, ideo Petrus toties locutus est cum Domino, et quoque instructus a Domino. Locutus est cum Domino quando Dominus transformatus est,<p>De tribus tabernaculis faciendis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_17_1-5" target=_top>Matthaeus 17:1-5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_9_2-8" target=_top>Marcus 9:2-8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_26-36" target=_top>Luca 9:26-36</a>).<p>Dominus tunc repraesentavit Verbum, quod est Divinum Verum; ac per "tabernacula" significatur cultus Domini ex bono amoris et inde veris.

Haec fides nunc intelligitur per "Petrum"; quare dicitur quod "conversus Petrus viderit discipulum, quem Jesus amabat, sequentem", et quod "dixerit de illo, Hic vero quid?" tum quod Jesus dixerit ad Petrum, "Quid ad te?" Per "discipulum sequentem Jesum" significabantur bona vitae, quae sunt bona opera; quae quod non peritura sint ad finem vitae, describitur per sequentia ibi.<p>[8] Ex his constare potest quod per "Petrum" etiam significetur fides separata a charitate; ut quoque dum<p>Petrus ter abnegavit Dominum (Matth. <sup>4</sup></p><p>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_14_29-31" target=_top>Marcus 14:29-31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_14_54" target=_top>54</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_14_66-72" target=_top>66-72</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_33" target=_top>Luca 22:33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_34" target=_top>34</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_50" target=_top>50</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_51" target=_top>51</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_55-62" target=_top>55-62</a> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_13_36-38" target=_top>Johannes 13:36-38</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_18_16-18" target=_top>18:16-18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_18_25-27" target=_top>25-27</a>):<p>Tum etiam cum Dominus conversus a Petro dixit ei, "Abi post Me, Satana; scandalum Mihi es, quia non sapis ea quae Dei sunt, sed quae hominum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_21-23" target=_top>Matthaeus 16:21-23</a>):<p>Et quando dixit ei Dominus, "Simon, Simon, ecce Satanas expostulavit vos, ut cribraret vos sicut triticum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_31" target=_top>Luca 22:31</a>).<p>Haec omnia adducta sunt, ut sciatur quod per "Petrum" apud Evangelistas in sensu repraesentativo significetur verum ex bono quod a Domino, tum fides ex charitate; et quoque in opposito sensu verum separatum a bono, quod in se est falsum, tum fides separata a charitate, quae in se non est fides.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>3.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>4.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
