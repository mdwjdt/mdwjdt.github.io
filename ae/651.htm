<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 651</h4><p>651. And shall overcome them, and kill them.- That this signifies the destruction thence of all the good and truth of the church, is evident from the signification of overcome and killing the two witnesses, as denoting to destroy those things which the two witnesses signify, which are the good of love and of charity, and the truth of doctrine and of faith. That the affections of the natural man separated from the affections of the spiritual man, which are evil desires of every kind arising from infernal loves, will destroy those things, is signified by the beast coming up out of the abyss; that it was predicted that this will come to pass at the end of the church, when the Last Judgment takes place, has been stated above. To kill, in the Word, signifies to kill spiritually, which is here to destroy the good of love and truth of doctrine, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/315.htm">315</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 651</h4><p>651. And shall overcome them and kill them, signifies the consequent destruction of every good and truth of the church. This is evident from the signification of "to overcome and kill the two witnesses," as being to destroy the things signified by "the two witnesses," which are the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith. That these will be destroyed by the affections of the natural man separated from the affections of the spiritual man, which are evil cupidities of every kind arising from infernal loves, is signified by "the beast that cometh up out of the abyss;" and that it was foretold that this would come to pass at the end of the church, when the Last Judgment takes place, has been said above. "To kill" signifies in the Word to kill spiritually, which means here to destroy the good of love and the truth of doctrine, as may be seen above n. <a href="../ae/315.htm">315</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 651 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>651. "Et vincet illos et occidet illos." - Quod significet inde destructionem omnis boni et veri ecclesiae, constat ex significatione "vincere et occidere binos testes", quod sit destruere illa quae per "binos testes" significantur, quae sunt bonum amoris et charitatis ac verum doctrinae et fidei: quod affectiones naturalis hominis separatae ab affectionibus spiritualis hominis, quae sunt cupiditates malae omnis generis oriundae ex amoribus infernalibus, destructurae sint illa, significetur per "bestiam ascendentem ex abysso"; et quod praedictum sit hoc futurum esse in fine ecclesiae, quando ultimum judicium existet, supra dictum est: quod "occidere" in Verbo significet spiritualiter occidere, quod hic est destruere bonum amoris et verum doctrinae, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_651/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_315" target=_top>315</a>). </p>
