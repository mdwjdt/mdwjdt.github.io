<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 695</h4><p>695. And to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the saints.- That this signifies heaven to those who are in truths of doctrine and in a life according to them, is evident from the signification of giving reward, as denoting salvation, consequently heaven; from the signification of his servants the prophets, as denoting those who are in truths of doctrine, for those are called servants of the Lord who are in truths, because truths serve to produce, confirm, and preserve good, and whatever serves good, serves the Lord, for all good is from the Lord, and they are called prophets who teach doctrine, therefore in an abstract sense, they signify doctrine (that those are called servants of God who are in truths, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/6.htm">6</a>, <a href="../ae/409.htm">409</a>; and prophets, those who teach doctrine, and in an abstract sense doctrines, n. 624); and from the signification of saints, as denoting those who are in the truths of doctrine from the Word, and in a life according them (concerning which see above n. 204). It is therefore evident, that to give the reward to his servants the prophets, and to the saints, signifies heaven to those who are in truths of doctrine and in a life according to them.</p><p>[2] That reward signifies salvation, and thus heaven, is evident without enlargement and explanation. But because few know what is properly meant by reward, it shall be stated. Reward properly means that delight, blessedness, and happiness which is contained in the love or affection for good and truth; this love or affection has in itself all that joy of heart which is called heavenly joy, and also heaven. The reason is, that the Lord is in this love or affection, and with the Lord also heaven. It is this joy, therefore, or this delight, blessedness, and happiness, that is properly meant by the reward which those will receive who do good and speak truth from love and affection for good and truth, thus from the Lord, and not in any way from themselves; and as they do this from the Lord, and not from themselves, therefore the reward is not of merit but of grace. From these things it is evident, that he who knows what heavenly joy is, may know also what reward is. What heavenly joy is in its essence may be seen in <a href="../hh/395.htm">Heaven and Hell 395-414</a>). This therefore is the signification of the reward which is given to those who are in truths from good; but the reward that those have who are in falsities from evil is joy or delight, and good fortune and happiness, in the world, but hell after their departure out of the world.</p><p>[3] From these few things the signification of reward in the following passages is clear.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in might; behold his reward is with him, and his recompense before him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">40:10</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh, and his recompense before him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">62:11</a>).<p>And in the Apocalypse:<p>"Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every one as his work shall be" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12</a>).<p>Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in might, and behold thy salvation cometh, and behold he cometh quickly, signify the first and second coming of the Lord. His reward is with him, signifies heaven, and all things pertaining to it, as above, for where the Lord is, there is heaven, heaven not being heaven from the angels there, but from the Lord with the angels. That they will receive heaven according to the love and affection for good and truth from the Lord, is meant by, his recompense before him, and by giving to every one as his work shall be. The work for which heaven shall be given as a reward, means nothing else than work from the love or affection for good and truth, for every work in man must spring out of that from which heaven exists. For a work derives its all from love or affection, just as an effect derives its all from the efficient cause, therefore as is the love or affection, so is the work. It is consequently evident what is meant by the work according to which it shall be given to every one, and what by recompense.</p><p>[4] Similarly in Isaiah:<p>"I Jehovah, who love judgment, will give the reward of their work in truth, and will make with them a covenant of eternity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_8.htm">61:8</a>).<p>The judgment which Jehovah loves signifies truth in faith, affection, and act, for man has judgment from truth, both when he thinks and desires truth, and when he speaks truth and acts according to it. And because this is signified by judgment, therefore it is said, "I will give the reward of their work in truth," that is, heaven according to faith in and affection for truth in act. And as from this there is conjunction with the Lord, from whom reward comes, therefore it is also said, "I will make with them a covenant of eternity"; for covenant, in the Word, signifies conjunction by love, and a covenant of eternity signifies conjunction by the love of good and truth, for this love being of the Lord Himself because it proceeds from Him, is conjunctive.</p><p>[5] That to love good and truth for the sake of good and truth is reward, because the Lord and heaven are in that love, is also evident from the following passages.<p>In Matthew:<p>"Do not ye your alms before men, to be seen of them, for otherwise ye have no reward of your Father, who is in the heavens. When thou doest alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly. And if thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men; verily I say to you, they have their reward; but thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father, who is in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_1.htm">6:1-6</a>).<p>By alms, in the most general sense, is signified all the good which a man desires and does, and by praying, in the same sense, is signified all the truth which a man thinks and speaks. Those who do these two things in order to be seen, that is, to make a display, do good and speak truth for the sake of themselves and ofthe world, that is, for the sake of glory, which is the delight of self love, and this they receive from the world. Because delight in glory is the reward of such persons, it is said that they have their reward; but this delight in glory, which in the world seems to them like heaven, is changed into hell after their departure out of the world. But those who do good and speak truth, not for the sake of themselves and of the world, but for the sake of good itself and truth itself, are meant by those who do alms in secret, and who pray in secret, for these act, and pray from love or affection, thus from the Lord. This therefore is to love good and truth for the sake of good and truth; of these therefore it is said, that their Father in the heavens will reward them openly. Thus reward is to be in goods and truths from love or affection, which is the same thing as to be in them from the Lord, since in these is heaven together with all the happiness and blessedness of heaven.</p><p>[6] In Luke:<p>"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not the rich, lest haply they should call thee in return, and a recompense be made thee, but call the poor, then shalt thou be blessed, for they have not wherewith to recompense thee for it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection" of the dead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>).<p>To make a dinner and a supper, and to call them, signifies the same as giving to eat and drink, or giving bread and wine, namely, to do good to the neighbour, and to teach truth, and thus to be associated in love. Those therefore who do this with a view to be recompensed, do it not for the sake of good and truth, thus not from the Lord, but for the sake of themselves and the world, and thus from hell; while those who do this, not for the purpose of being recompensed, do it for its own sake, namely, for the sake of good and truth; and those who act for the sake of these act from them, thus from the Lord, who is the source of these with man. The heavenly blessedness which is in and thus from those deeds is reward, and is meant by, it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the dead.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>"Rather love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; then shall your reward be much, and ye shall be sons of the Most High" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_35.htm">6:35</a>).<p>The signification of these words is similar to that above, namely, that good is not to be done for the sake of recompense, that is, for the sake of self and the world, thus not for the sake of reputation, glory, honour, and gain, but for the sake of the Lord, that is for the sake of good itself and truth itself which they have from the Lord, and in which therefore the Lord is. To love enemies and do good to them, means here in the nearest sense, to love the Gentiles and do good to them, and this by teaching them truth and leading them to good by means of it; for the Jewish nation called their own people brethren and friends, but they called the Gentiles foes and enemies. To lend signifies to communicate the goods and truths of doctrine from the Word; hoping for nothing again, signifies, not for the sake of any thing of self and of the world, but for the sake of good and truth. Then shall your reward be much, signifies that then heaven with its happiness and delights shall be theirs; and ye shall be sons of the Most High, signifies because they do these things not from themselves but from the Lord. For he who does good and teaches truth from the Lord is His son, but not he who does good from self; and this is what every one does who looks to honour and gain as the end of his actions.</p><p>[8] In Matthew:<p>"He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; he that receiveth a just man, in the name of a just man, shall receive a just man's reward. Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a drink of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple, he shall not lose his reward" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_41.htm">10:41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_42.htm">42</a>).<p>How these words of the Lord are to be understood, no one can see except from their internal or spiritual sense; for who can know what is meant by receiving a prophet's reward, and a just man's reward, and by receiving a prophet and a just man in the name of a prophet and of a just man? also what is meant by the reward which he shall receive who shall give to drink unto one of the little ones a drink of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple? Without the internal spiritual sense, who can see that these words mean that every one will receive heaven and the joy thereof according to his affection for truth and good, and according to obedience?</p><p>[9] That this is the meaning becomes evident, when it is seen that prophet means the truth of doctrine, just man, the good of love, and disciple, the truth and good of the Word and of the church, and that in their name means for the sake of these, and according to their quality in those who do and teach them; also that reward means heaven, as said above, namely, that heaven is with every one in the measure of his affection for truth and good, and according to its quantity and quality. For all things of heaven are inscribed on these affections, since no one can possess these affections except from the Lord, for it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord, in which and from which heaven is.</p><p>[10] To give to drink a drink of cold [water] only unto one of the little ones, in the name of a disciple, means to do good and teach truth from obedience, for water signifies truth in affection, and cold water, truth in obedience, for obedience alone is a natural and not a spiritual affection, and is therefore comparatively cold; and a disciple in whose name or for whose sake it is given to drink, signifies the truth and good of the Word and of the church. That a prophet signifies the truth of doctrine, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/624.htm">624</a>); that a just man signifies the good of love (n. <a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>); that a disciple signifies the truth and good of the Word and of the church (n. <a href="../ae/100.htm">100</a>, <a href="../ae/122.htm">122</a>); and that name signifies the quality of a thing and state (n. <a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a>, <a href="../ae/135.htm">135</a>, <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>, <a href="../ae/676.htm">676</a>).</p><p>[11] In Mark:<p>"Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward" (<a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>, <a href="../ae/685.htm">685</a>).</p><p>[12] In Zechariah:<p>"The foundation of the house of Jehovah Zebaoth was laid, that the temple might be built; for before these days there was no reward of man, or reward of beast, and to him that went out and to him that came in no peace from the enemy. Now the seed of peace; the vine shall give fruit, and the earth shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew" (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>). Before these days there was no reward of man, or reward of beast, signifies that before this no one had any spiritual affection for truth and good, or any natural affection for truth and good, man signifying spiritual affection for truth, beast, natural affection for good, and reward heaven, which those possess who are in affections for truth and good. That man signifies spiritual affection for truth, and consequent intelligence, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/280.htm">280</a>, <a href="../ae/546.htm">546</a>, <a href="../ae/547.htm">547</a>); and that beast signifies natural affection (n. <a href="../ae/650.htm">650</a>).</p><p>[13] To him that went out and to him that came in, no peace from the enemy, signifies that heretofore they had been infested by hell in every state of life, going out and coming in signifying the state of life from beginning to end, no peace, infestation by evils and falsities therefrom, while enemy signifies hell, the source of evils and falsities. The seed of peace signifies the truth of heaven and of the church, which is from the Lord; this is called the seed of peace, because it defends against the hells, and gives security. The vine shall give its fruit, and the earth its produce, signifies that spiritual affection for truth shall bring forth the good of charity, and natural affection for good and truth shall, bring forth the works of charity, the vine signifying the church as to the spiritual affection for truth, the earth, the church as to the natural affection for truth, fruit, the good of charity, and produce, the works of that good. The heavens shall give dew signifies that these things are from influx through heaven from the Lord.</p><p>[14] In John:<p>"Lift up your eyes, and behold the fields that they are white already for harvest, and he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_35.htm">4:35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_36.htm">36</a>).<p>These things also are said of a new church from the Lord. That it is at hand is signified by the fields being white already for harvest; those of that church who are in the spiritual affection for truth, and thus in heaven, are meant by, he that reapeth receiveth reward, and gathereth fruit unto eternal life; and the Lord Himself, from whom the affection for truth, and heaven are derived, is meant by he that soweth may rejoice together [with him that reapeth.]</p><p>[15] In Jeremiah:<p>"Rachel mourning for her sons, refused to be comforted for her sons, because they were not. But refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labour; for they shall return from the land of the enemy, and there is hope for thy latter end, for thy sons shall return to their own border" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_15.htm">31:15-17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>).<p>That these words refer to the infant boys that were put to death in Bethlehem by command of Herod is evident from the passage cited in Matthew, but what this signified has not yet been known; the signification is this, that when the Lord came into the world, there was no spiritual truth remaining. For Rachel represented the internal spiritual church, and Leah, the external natural church, Bethlehem the Spiritual, and the boys who were put to death, truth from that source. That there was no spiritual truth any longer remaining is signified by Rachel mourning for her sons, and refusing to be comforted for her sons, because, they were not.</p><p>[16] That henceforth there will be no grief on that account, because the Lord has been born, from whom there will be a new church, which will be in truths from spiritual affection, is signified by, refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labour, His reward signifying heaven with those who will be of that church from a spiritual affection for truth, and labour signifying the Lord's combat against the hells, and the subjugation of them, in order that a new church might be established. That a new church will be established in the place of the one that perished, is signified by they shall return from the land of the enemy, and there is hope for thy latter end, also by, thy sons shall return to their own border; to return from the land of the enemy signifies to be brought out of hell, hope for thy latter end, signifies the end of the former church and the beginning of the new, while the sons returning to the border signifies that spiritual truths will exist with those who will be of that new church.</p><p>[17] Again in Isaiah:<p>"I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength in emptiness and vanity; yet surely my judgment is with Jehovah and the reward of my work with my God" (<a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell 589-603</a>), and the <a href="../lj/33.htm">Last Judgment 33</a>, <a href="../lj/34.htm">34</a>, <a href="../lj/73.htm">73</a>, <a href="../lj/74.htm">74</a>).</p><p>[18] In David:<p>"Lo, sons are a heritage of Jehovah, a reward the fruit of the womb; as darts in the hand of the mighty, so are sons of youth; happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, when they shall speak with enemies in the gate" (<a href="../ae/357.htm">357:10</a>), where it is also shown that reward signifies the happiness which those enjoy who are in heaven.</p><p>[19] In the Evangelists:<p>"Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say every evil word against you falsely," for Christ's sake; "rejoice and be exceeding glad, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_12.htm">12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_23.htm">23</a>).<p>This is said of those who fight and conquer in temptations induced by evils, thus by hell; temptations are signified by reproaching, persecuting, and saying an evil word falsely for Christ's sake, for temptations are assaults upon and infestations of truth and good by falsities and evils. "Christ" means Divine Truth from the Lord, which is assaulted, and on account of which they are infested. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, because great is your reward in the heavens, signifies heaven and its joy with those who are in the spiritual affection for truth, for such alone fight and conquer, because the Lord is in that affection, and resists and conquers for man in the combats of temptations. For so persecuted they the prophets who were before you, signifies that formerly they similarly assaulted the truths of doctrine with those who were in the spiritual affection for truth, for prophets, in an impersonal sense, signify truths from the Word, or from the Lord.<p>From what has been now cited from the Word, it is evident that reward signifies heaven in respect to its happiness, blessedness, and delight, which those have who are in the spiritual affection for truth and good, and that the reward is that affection itself; for whether you say that affection, or heaven, it amounts to the same thing, since heaven is in and from that affection.</p><p>[20] But those who speak truth and do good, not from a spiritual but only from a natural affection, and who continually think of heaven as a reward, were represented in the Israelitish church by hirelings, concerning whom there were many statutes in that church. As that the hirelings should not eat of the passover (<a href="../njhd/150.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 150-158</a>).</p><p>[21] But hirelings who do not think of reward in heaven, but of reward in the world, that is who do good for the sake of gain, whether it be honours or wealth, consequently from the love of honours or wealth, that is for the sake of self and of the world, are infernal-natural. These hirelings are meant in John:<p>"I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his soul for the sheep, but the hireling seeth the wolf and forsaketh the sheep, and fleeth, because he is a hireling" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_11.htm">10:11-13</a>),<p>and in Jeremiah:<p>"Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; destruction cometh from the north, her hirelings are like fatted calves, for they also have turned themselves back, they flee together, they stood not, because the day of their destruction is come upon them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_20.htm">46:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_21.htm">21</a>);<p>and also elsewhere, as in Isaiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_16_14.htm">16:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_21_16.htm">21:16</a>).</p><p>[22] As reward, in the Word, signifies heaven, which those have who are in the spiritual love of truth and good, so reward, in the opposite sense, signifies hell, which those have who are in the love of falsity and evil; this is the signification of reward in David:<p>"He shall put on cursing as his garment, and it hath entered into the midst of him as waters, and as oil between his bones; this is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_109_18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_109_20.htm">20</a>).<p>These words, in the spiritual sense, are to be understood of the Lord; for where David speaks of himself in the Psalms, in that sense the Lord is meant, David as a king representing the Lord, and thus signifying Him as to the spiritual Divine, which is the royalty of the Lord. The reward of the Lord's adversaries and of them that speak evil against His soul, is described as hell from the love of falsity and evil, as follows, "he shall put on cursing as his garment, and it hath entered into the midst of him as waters, and as oil between his bones." Hell which is received in externals and in internals is described by those two expressions, cursing put on as a garment describing the hell that is received in externals, and cursing entering into the midst of him as waters, and as oil between his bones describing the hell that is received in internals. It is said as waters and as oil, because waters signify falsities from faith, and oil, evils from love, therefore the two expressions mean the love or affection for falsity and evil, which is hell, as is evident also from this fact, that love imbibes everything which agrees with it, just as a sponge imbibes water and oil; for the love of evil is nourished upon falsities, and the love of falsity is nourished upon evils; and love being such, it is therefore said that cursing enters into the midst of him as waters, and as oil between his bones.</p><p>[23] Because reward, in the opposite sense, signifies hell as to the affection for falsity from evil, therefore the falsification of truth is everywhere in the Word called the reward of whoredom.<p>As in Hosea:<p>"Rejoice not, O Israel, to exultation as the nations, because thou hast committed whoredom under God; thou hast loved the reward of whoredom upon every corn-floor; the floor and the press shall not feed them [and the new wine (mustum) shall deceive her]" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_1.htm">9:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_2.htm">2</a>).<p>To commit whoredom under God signifies to falsify the truths of the Word, and to apply the holy things of the church to idolatries. To love the reward of whoredom, signifies delight in falsifying and in falsity, and also in idolatry, from infernal love. Upon every corn-floor, signifies all things of the Word and of doctrine from the Word, for corn, from which bread is made, signifies every thing that spiritually nourishes, while the floor signifies where it is collected together, consequently the Word. The floor and the press shall not feed them, signifies not to draw from the Word the good things of charity and of love, that is, those things which nourish the soul, for the floor there denotes the Word as to the goods of charity, and the press, as to the goods of love, the press here meaning oil, for which there were presses as well as for wine. And the new wine shall deceive her, signifies that neither shall there be any truth of good, for new wine (mustum), just as wine (vinum), signifies truth from the good of charity and love.</p><p>[24] In Micah:<p>"All the graven images" of Samaria "shall be beaten to pieces, and all the rewards of her whoredom shall be burned in the fire, and I will lay waste all their idols, for she hath gathered them from the reward of whoredom, therefore to the reward of whoredom shall they return; therefore I will lament and howl, I will go stripped and naked" (<a href="../ae/587.htm">587</a>, <a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>).</p><p>[25] In Ezekiel:<p>"Thou hast built thy height at the head of every way, and thy lofty place in every street; neither hast thou been as a harlot to glory in reward; the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband; they give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them, that they might come unto thee from all sides in thy whoredoms. Thus it was contrary in thee from women in thy whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward was given thee, therefore thou hast been contrary" (<a href="../ae/652.htm">652:17</a>). That adulteries and whoredoms, in the Word signify adulterations and falsifications of the truth and good of the church, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../ae/511.htm">511</a>). Not to have been as a harlot to glory in reward signifies not to have so falsified the truths of the Word from a delight of affection; the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband signifies the perversion of the truths and goods of the Word by the falsities of other nations. They give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them, signifies that they loved the falsities of religion and of worship of other nations, a reward or gift of whoredom denotes the love of falsifying by means of the falsities of others; that they might come to thee from all sides in thy whoredoms signifies that falsities were searched for in every direction, by means of which they falsified truth. Thus it was contrary in thee from women in their whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward was given thee, therefore thou hast been contrary, signifies the delight of the love and affection for falsifying the truths of their church by means of the falsities of other religions, and of confirming those falsifications; the delight of love and affection towards the falsities of other religions is here meant by reward or a gift of whoredom.</p><p>[26] From what has now been adduced, it is evident what is spiritually meant by reward in both senses; for that which affects with delight and joy is spiritual reward. For example there are riches, possessions, honours, and gifts, with which a man is rewarded for well-doing; these things are not reward spiritually understood, but the delights and joys which proceed from them. Much more is this the case with the heavenly reward, that the man of the church who lives well will receive, which is the spiritual affection for truth, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom, which is the source of blessedness and happiness. Moreover, in heaven there are opulence and magnificence which proceed from heavenly love, as its correspondent; yet in heaven opulence and magnificence are not regarded as reward, but the Spiritual from which they are. This also is meant by the price of a work, and by the reward, which is in the Lord and from the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_8.htm">61:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">62:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>; and elsewhere). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 695</h4><p>695. And to give reward to His <sup>1</sup>servants, the prophets and the saints, signifies heaven to those who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them. This is evident from the signification of "giving reward," as being salvation, and thus heaven; also from the signification of "His servants the prophets," as being those who are in the truths of doctrine, for those are called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths, because truths are serviceable for bringing forth, confirming, and preserving good, and whatever serves good serves the Lord, since every good is from the Lord. Those are called "prophets" who teach doctrine, thus in an abstract sense they signify doctrine. (That those are called "servants of God" who are in truths see above, n. <a href="../ae/6.htm">6</a>, <a href="../ae/409.htm">409</a>; and "prophets" who teach doctrine, and in an abstract sense doctrines, n. <a href="../ae/624.htm">624</a>.) The above is evident also from the signification of "saints" as being those who are in the truths of doctrine from the Word and in a life according to them (See above, n. <a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>). From this it is clear that "to give reward to His servants, the prophets and saints," signifies heaven to those who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them.</p><p>[2] That "reward" signifies salvation, and thus heaven, can be seen without amplification and explanation; but as few know what is properly meant by "reward" it shall be told. "Reward" means properly that delight, blessedness, and happiness that is in the love or affection of good and truth. This love or affection has in itself all joy of heart, which is called heavenly joy, and also heaven; and for the reason that the Lord is in that love or affection, and with the Lord is heaven; consequently such joy, or such delight, blessedness, and happiness, is what is properly meant by the "reward" that those will receive who do good and speak truth from the love or affection of good and truth, thus from the Lord, and in no wise from themselves; and as they do this from the Lord and not from themselves it is not a reward of merit but a reward of grace. This shows that whoever knows what heavenly joy is also knows what reward is. (What heavenly joy is in its essence can be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/395.htm">Heaven and Hell 395-414</a>.) This, therefore, is what is meant by the "reward" that those have who are in truths from good. But the "reward" that those have who are in falsities from evil is joy or delight, good fortune, and happiness in the world, but hell after their departure out of the world.</p><p>[3] From these few words the signification of "reward" in the following passages can be seen. In Isaiah:<p>Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength; behold His reward is with Him, and the wages of His work are with <sup>2</sup>Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh, and the wages of His work are with <sup>3</sup>Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>).<p>And in Revelation:<p>Behold I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to give to each one as his work shall be (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>).<p>"Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength," and "Behold thy salvation cometh," and "Behold He cometh quickly," signify the first and second coming of the Lord. "His reward is with Him" signifies heaven and all things belonging to it, as above, since where the Lord is, there heaven is, for heaven is not heaven from the angels there, but from the Lord with the angels. That heaven will be received in the measure of the love and affection of good and truth from the Lord is meant by "the wages of His work are before Him," and by "He will give to each one as his work shall be." No other work is meant by the "work" for which heaven is given as a reward than work from the love or affection of good and truth, for from that must be every work with man from which is heaven. For a work derives its all from love or affection, just as the effect derives its all from the effecting cause, therefore such as the love or affection is, such is the work. Thence it may be clear what is meant by "the work according to which it shall be given to everyone," and what is meant by "the wages of work."</p><p>[4] Likewise in Isaiah:<p>I Jehovah love judgment, I will give the reward of their work in truth, and will make with them a covenant of eternity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>).<p>The "judgment that Jehovah loves" signifies truth in faith, in affection, and in act, for man has judgment from truth, both when he thinks and desires truth, and when he speaks truth and acts according to it; and as this is what is signified by "judgment," therefore it is said "I will give the reward of their work in truth," that is, heaven according to the faith of truth and the affection of it in act; and as from this is conjunction with the Lord, from whom reward comes, therefore it is added, "I will make with them a covenant of eternity," "covenant" signifying in the Word conjunction by love, and "a covenant of eternity" conjunction by the love of good and truth, for that love conjoins, since it is of the Lord Himself and proceeds from Him.</p><p>[5] That loving good and truth for the sake of good and truth is reward, for the reason that the Lord and heaven are in that love, can also be seen from the following passages. In Matthew:<p>Do not ye your alms before men; to be seen by them, for otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. When thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you they have their reward. But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret will reward thee openly. And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men; verily I say unto you, they have their reward; but when thou prayest enter into thy chamber, and shutting thy door pray to thy Father who is in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_1.htm">Matthew 6:1-6</a>).<p>"Alms" in the most general sense signifies every good that man wills and does, and "to pray" signifies in the same sense every truth that man thinks and speaks. Those who do these two things "to be seen," that is, that they may be manifest, do good and speak truth for the sake of self and the world, that is, for the sake of glory, which is the delight of self-love that the world affords. Because delight in glory is the reward of such it is said "they have their reward;" but this delight in glory, which in the world seems to them like heaven, is changed after death into hell. But those who do good and speak truth, not for the sake of self and the world but for the sake of good itself and truth itself, are meant by those who "do alms in secret," and who "pray in secret," for they act and pray from love or affection, thus from the Lord; this, therefore, is loving good and truth for the sake of good and truth; and of such it is said that "the Father in the heavens will reward them openly." Thus "reward" is to be in goods and truths from love or affection, which is the same as being in them from the Lord, since in these is heaven and every blessedness and happiness of heaven.</p><p>[6] In Luke:<p>When thou makest a dinner or a supper call not the rich, lest haply they should call thee in turn; and a recompense be made to thee; but call the poor; then shalt thou be blessed, for they have not wherewith to recompense thee; for it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the dead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_12.htm">Luke 14:12-14</a>).<p>"To make a dinner and a supper and to call to them" has a similar signification as giving to eat and drink, or bread and wine, namely, doing good to the neighbor, and teaching truth, and being thus consociated in love; so those who do this for the purpose of being recompensed do it not for the sake of good and truth, thus not from the Lord, but for the sake of self and the world, thus from hell; while those who do this not for the purpose of being recompensed, do it for its own sake, that is, for the sake of good and truth, and those who do it for the sake of good and truth do it from good and truth, thus from the Lord, from whom are good and truth with man. The heavenly blessedness that is in such deeds and thence from them is "reward" and is meant by "it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the dead."</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>Rather love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again; then shall your reward be much, and ye shall be sons of the Most High (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p>This has a similar signification as the previous passage, namely, that good is not to be done for the sake of recompense, that is, for the sake of self and the world, thus not for the sake of reputation, glory, honor, and gain, but for the Lord's sake, that is, for the sake of good itself and truth itself which are with such from the Lord, thus in which the Lord is. "To love enemies and do good to them" means here, in the nearest sense, to love the Gentiles and do good to them, which is to be done by teaching them truth and leading them by it to good; for the Jewish nation called their own people brethren and friends, but the Gentiles they called adversaries and enemies. "To lend" signifies to communicate goods and truths of doctrine from the Word; "to hope for nothing again" signifies, not for the sake of anything of self and of the world, but for the sake of good and truth; "then shall your reward be much" signifies that then they shall have heaven with its blessedness and delights; "and ye shall be sons of the Most High" signifies because they do these things not from self but from the Lord; for he who does good and teaches truth from the Lord is the Lord's son, but not he who does good from self, which is what everyone does who looks to honor and gain as his end.</p><p>[8] In Matthew:<p>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, he shall not lose his reward (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_42.htm">42</a>).<p>How these words of the Lord are to be understood no one can see except from their internal or spiritual sense; for who can know what is meant by "receiving a prophet's reward" and "a righteous man's reward," and by "receiving a prophet and a righteous man in the name of a prophet and a righteous man;" also what is meant by the "reward" that he will receive who "shall give to drink unto one of the little ones a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple"? Without the internal spiritual sense, who can see that these words mean that everyone shall receive heaven and its joy in the measure of his affection of truth and good, and in the measure of his obedience?</p><p>[9] This meaning becomes evident when it is seen that "prophet" means the truth of doctrine, "righteous man" the good of love, and "disciple" the truth and good of the Word and of the church, and that "in their name" means for the sake of these, and according to their quality with those who do and teach them; also that "reward" means heaven, as has been said above, namely, that everyone has heaven in the measure of his affection of truth and good, and according to its quality and quantity; for on these affections all things of heaven are inscribed, since no one can have these affections except from the Lord, for it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord in which and from which is heaven.</p><p>[10] "To give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple" means to do good and teach truth from obedience, for "water" signifies the truth in affection, and "cold [water]" truth in obedience, for obedience alone is a natural, not a spiritual, affection, and is therefore comparatively cold; and a "disciple" in whose name or for whose sake it is "given to drink" signifies the truth and good of the Word and of the church. (That "a prophet" signifies the truth of doctrine can be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/624.htm">624</a>); that "a righteous man" signifies the good of love, n. <a href="../ae/204.htm">204</a>; that a "disciple" signifies the truth and good of the Word and of the church, n. <a href="../ae/100.htm">100</a>, <a href="../ae/122.htm">122</a>; and that "name" signifies the quality of a thing and <sup>4</sup>state, n. <a href="../ae/102.htm">102</a>, <a href="../ae/135.htm">135</a>, <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>, <a href="../ae/676.htm">676</a>.)</p><p>[11] In Mark:<p>Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward (<a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>, <a href="../ae/685.htm">685</a>.)</p><p>[12] In Zechariah:<p>The foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts hath been laid, the temple, that it may be built; for before these days there was no reward of man, nor reward of beast, and to him that went out and to him that came in there was no peace from the adversary. Now the seed of peace, the vine shall give its fruit, and the land shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew (<a href="../ae/220.htm">220</a>). That before this, no one had any spiritual affection of truth and good or any natural affection of truth and good is signified by "before these days there was no reward of man, nor reward of beast;" "man" signifying the spiritual affection of truth, and "beast" the natural affection of good, and "reward" heaven, which those have who are in the affections of truth and good. (That "man" signifies the spiritual affection of truth, and consequent intelligence, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/280.htm">280</a>, <a href="../ae/546.htm">546</a>, <a href="../ae/547.htm">547</a>; and that "beast" signifies the natural affection, n. <a href="../ae/650.htm">650</a>.)</p><p>[13] "To him that went out and to him that came in there was no peace from the adversary" signifies that heretofore they had been infested by hell in every state of life; "to go out and come in" signifying the state of life from beginning to end, "there was no peace" signifying infestation by evils and falsities therefrom, and "adversary" signifying hell, the source of evils and falsities. "The seed of peace" signifies the truth of heaven and the church, which is from the Lord; this is called "the seed of peace" because it defends from the hells and gives security. "The vine shall give fruit and the land produce" signifies that the spiritual affection of truth shall bring forth the good of charity, and the natural affection of good and truth shall bring forth the works of charity; "vine" signifying the church in respect to the spiritual affection of truth, "land" the church in respect to the natural affection of truth, "fruit" the good of charity, and "produce" the works of that good. "The heavens shall give dew" signifies that these things are from influx through heaven from the Lord.</p><p>[14] In John:<p>Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, that they are white already for harvest; and he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_35.htm">John 4:35</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_36.htm">36</a>).<p>This, too, is said of a New Church from the Lord. That it is at hand is signified by "the fields that are white already for harvest;" those of that church who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and thence in heaven, are meant by "he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal;" and the Lord Himself, from whom is that affection of truth, and heaven, is meant by "he that soweth may rejoice together with him that reapeth."</p><p>[15] In Jeremiah:<p>Rachel weeping for her sons, she refuseth to be comforted for her sons because they are not. But refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labor, for they shall return from the land of the enemy; and there is hope for thy latter end, for thy sons shall return to their own border (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>).<p>This refers to the infant boys put to death in Bethlehem by command of Herod, as is evident from the passage cited in Matthew; but what this signifies has not heretofore been known. The signification is that when the Lord came into the world there was no spiritual truth remaining; for "Rachel" represented the internal spiritual church, and "Leah" the external natural church, "Bethlehem" the spiritual, and "the boys put to death" truth from that origin. That there was no spiritual truth any longer remaining is signified by "Rachel weeping for her sons, she refuseth to be comforted for her sons, because they are not."</p><p>[16] That henceforth there will be no grief on that account, because the Lord has been born, from whom there will be a New Church that will be in truths from spiritual affection, is signified by "refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labor," "His reward" signifying heaven for those who will be of that church from the spiritual affection of truth, and "labor" signifying the Lord's combats against the hells and the subjugation of the hells that a New Church may be established. That the New Church will be established in the place of the one that perished is signified by "they shall return from the land of the enemy, and there is hope for the latter end," also by "thy sons shall return to their own border;" "to return from the land of the enemy" signifying to be brought out of hell; "hope for the latter end" signifying the end of the former church and the beginning of the new, and "the sons shall return to their own border" signifying that spiritual truths will exist with those who will be of that New Church.</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>I said, I have labored in vain, I have consumed my strength in emptiness and vanity; yet surely my judgment is with Jehovah, and the reward of my work with my God (<a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell 589-603</a>, and in the small work <a href="../lj/33.htm">Last Judgment 33</a>, <a href="../lj/34.htm">34</a>, <a href="../lj/73.htm">73</a>, <a href="../lj/74.htm">74</a>.)</p><p>[18] In David:<p>Behold, sons are a heritage of Jehovah, the fruit of the womb is a reward; as darts in the hand of the mighty so are the sons of youth; happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them, they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak with enemies in the gate (<a href="../ae/357.htm">357</a>; and that "reward" here also signifies the happiness that those have who are in heaven.</p><p>[19] In the Gospels:<p>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and say every evil word against you falsely for Christ's sake, rejoice and exult, for much is your reward in the heavens; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_12.htm">12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_23.htm">23</a>).<p>This is said of those who fight and conquer in temptations induced by evils, that is, by hell; temptations are signified by "reviling," "persecuting," and "saying an evil word falsely for Christ's sake," for temptations are assaults and infestations of truth and good by falsities and evils; "Christ" means Divine truth from the Lord which is assaulted and on account of which they are infested. "Rejoice and exult, for much is your reward in the heavens," signifies heaven with its joy which those have who are in the spiritual affection of truth, for such only fight and conquer, since the Lord resists and conquers for the man in the combats of temptations, and He is in that affection; "for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you" signifies that previously the truths of doctrine with those who were in the spiritual affection of truth had in like manner been assaulted, for "prophets" in a sense abstracted from persons signify truths from the Word or from the Lord. From what has thus far been cited from the Word it can be seen that "reward" signifies heaven in respect to its blessedness, happiness, and delight, which those have who are in the spiritual affection of truth and good, and that the reward is that affection itself; for it is the same whether you say heaven or that affection, for heaven is in that affection and from it.</p><p>[20] But those who speak truth and do good not from spiritual affection but from merely natural affection, and who think continually of heaven as a reward, were represented in the Israelitish church by "hired servants," respecting whom there were in that church many statutes, as:<p>That hired servants should not eat of the Passover (<a href="../njhd/150.htm">150-158</a>).</p><p>[21] But hired servants who do not think of reward in heaven but of reward in the world, thus who do good for the sake of gain, whether it be honors or wealth, thus who do good from the love of honor or wealth, thus, for the sake of self and the world, are infernal-natural. Such "hired servants" are meant in John:<p>I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his soul for the sheep. But a hired servant seeth the wolf and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, because he is a hired servant (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_11.htm">John 10:11-13</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>A very fair she-calf is Egypt; destruction cometh out of the north; her hired servants are like fattened calves, for they also are turned, they flee together, they stood not, for the day of their calamity is come upon them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_46_21.htm">21</a>);<p>and elsewhere (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_16_14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_21_16.htm">21:16</a>).</p><p>[22] Because in the Word "reward" signifies heaven, which those have who are in the spiritual love of truth and good, so in the contrary sense "reward" signifies hell, which those have who are in the love of falsity and evil. Such is the signification of "reward" in David:<p>He shall clothe himself with cursing as with his garment and it entereth into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones. This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_109_18.htm">Psalms 109:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_109_20.htm">20</a>).<p>By this in the spiritual sense the Lord is meant, for where David speaks of himself in the Psalms, in that sense the Lord is meant, David as a king representing the Lord, and thus signifying Him in relation to the Divine-spiritual, which is the Lord's royalty. "The reward of the Lord's adversaries, and of them that speak evil against His soul," is described as a hell from the love of falsity and evil, by this, that "he shall clothe himself with cursing as with his garment" and "it hath entered into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones," these two expressions describing hell as received in externals and in internals, "to clothe himself with cursing as with a garment" describing the hell that is received in externals, and "cursing entering into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones," describing the hell that is received in internals. It is said "as waters," and "as oil," because "waters" signify the falsities of faith, and "oil" the evils of the love, so the two expressions mean the love or affection of falsity and evil, which is hell, as can be seen also from this, that love imbibes all things that are in harmony with it, just as a sponge imbibes water and oil; for the love of evil is nourished by falsities, and the love of falsity is nourished by evils, and love being such, it is said that "cursing enters into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones."</p><p>[23] Since in the contrary sense "reward" signifies hell in respect to the affection of falsity from evil, therefore the falsification of truth is here and there called in the Word "the reward of whoredom." As in Hosea:<p>Be not glad, O Israel, unto exultation like the nations, <sup>5</sup>for thou hast committed whoredom from under thy God; thou hast loved the reward of whoredom upon all corn-floors; the floor and the wine-vat shall not feed them <sup>6</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_2.htm">2</a>).<p>"To commit whoredom from under God" signifies to falsify the truths of the Word, and to apply the holy things of the church to idolatries; "to love the reward of whoredom" signifies the delight of falsifying and of falsity and of idolatry from infernal love; "upon all corn-floors" signifies all things of the Word and of doctrine from the Word, for "corn," of which bread is made, signifies all things that nourish spiritually, and "floor" signifies where these are gathered together, that is, the Word; "the floor and the wine-vat shall not feed them" signifies not to draw from the Word the good things of charity and love, that is, the things that will nourish the soul, for the "floor" here means the Word in respect to the goods of charity and the "wine-vat" the Word in respect to goods of love, the "vat" here meaning oil, for which as well as for wine there were vats; "and the new wine shall dissemble unto her" signifies that neither shall there be any truth of good; for "new wine," the same as "wine," signifies truth from the good of charity and love.</p><p>[24] In Micah:<p>All the graven images of Samaria shall be beaten in pieces, and all the rewards of her whoredom shall be burned up with fire, and all their idols will I lay waste; for she hath brought them together from the reward of whoredom, therefore to the reward of whoredom shall they return; for this I will lament and howl, I will go stripped and naked (<a href="../ae/587.htm">587</a>, <a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>).</p><p>[25] In Ezekiel:<p>Thou hast built thy eminent place at the head of every way, and thy exalted place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot to glory in reward; the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband; they give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers, and hast given them presents that they might come unto thee from every side in thy whoredoms. Thus the contrary is in thee from women in thy whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward has been given to thee, therefore thou hast been contrary (<a href="../ae/652.htm">652</a>. That "adulteries and whoredoms" signify in the Word the adulterations and falsifications of the truth and good of the church may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../ae/511.htm">511</a>); therefore "not to have been as a harlot to glory in reward" signifies not to have so falsified the truths of the Word from the delight of affection; "the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband" signifies the truths and goods of the Word perverted by the falsities of other nations; "they give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers and hast given them presents," signifies that they loved the falsities of religion and of the worship of other nations; a "reward or gift of whoredom" meaning the love of falsifying by means of the falsities of others; "that they might come unto thee from every side in thy whoredoms" signifies that falsities were searched for from every direction, whereby truth was falsified; "thus the contrary is in thee from women in thy whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward has been given to thee, therefore thou hast been contrary," signifies the delight of the love and affection of falsifying the truths of their church by the falsities of other religions, and of confirming such falsities, "the reward or gift of whoredoms" meaning the delight of the love and affection towards the falsities of other religions.</p><p>[26] From that which has been stated, what is meant spiritually by "reward" in both senses can now be seen; for that which affects with delight and joy is spiritual reward. For example, there are riches, possessions, honors, and gifts, by which a man is rewarded for well-doing; these are not "reward," spiritually understood, but the delights and joys which spring from these; much more is this true of the heavenly reward that the man of the church who lives well will have, which is the spiritual affection of truth, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom, which is the source of blessedness and happiness. Moreover, in heaven there is opulence and magnificence which results from the heavenly love as its correspondent, but yet in heaven it is not opulence and magnificence that are regarded as reward, but the spiritual from which they are. This, too, is what is meant by "the price of a work," and by "reward," which is in the Lord and from the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_8.htm">61:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">62:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>; and elsewhere).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedenborg in the heading corrected "His" into "Thy," but left it uncorrected immediately below and in <a href="../ae/695.htm">695</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "beore," as found below in the explanation, and also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1793.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1793</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;The Latin has "is" for "and."<br><br>4.&nbsp;The Latin has "For if" for "For so."<br><br>5.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "peoples."<br><br>6.&nbsp;The photolithograph omits "And the new wine shall dissemble unto her," but explains it in the text. </p>

per "mercedem" hic significatur ecclesia quae in affectione veri spirituali est; per "laborem" et per "opus" significatur pugna Domini contra inferna et subjugatio illorum, per quam Dominus restituit aequilibrium inter caelum et infernum, in quo homo recipere potest verum et fieri spiritualis.

tentationes significantur per "afficere probris", "persequi", "dicere malum verbum", "mentiri propter Christum", tentationes enim sunt impugnationes et infestationes veri et boni a falsis et malis; per "Christum" intelligitur Divinum Verum a Domino, quod impugnatur et propter quod infestantur: "Gaudete et exultate, quia merces vestra magna in caelis", significat caelum cum ejus gaudio illis qui in affectione veri spirituali sunt, nam illi soli pugnant et vincunt, ex causa quia Dominus in illa affectione est, qui pro homine in pugnis tentationum resistit et vincit; " <sup>7</sup></p><p>sic enim persecuti sunt prophetas qui ante vos" significat quod prius similiter impugnaverint vera doctrinae quae apud illos qui in affectione veri spirituali fuerunt, per "prophetas" enim abstracte a personis significantur vera ex Verbo, seu ex Domino.<p>Ex his quae nunc e Verbo allata sunt; constare potest quod per "mercedem" significetur caelum quoad ejus beatum, faustum et jucundum, quod illis est qui in affectione veri et boni spirituali sunt, et quod "merces" sit ipsa illa affectio;

et spirituales ab ecclesia sunt, et non ita naturales: nam spectare caelum ut mercedem propter bona quae faciunt est naturale, naturale enim spectat bonum ex se, ita caelum ut mercedem, unde bonum fit meritorium; aliter vero spirituale; hoc agnoscit bonum non a se sed a Domino, unde etiam caelum ex misericordia, et non ex aliquo merito: at quoniam usque bonum faciunt, tametsi non ex affectione spirituali, sed ex affectione naturali, quae est obedientia, et tunc cogitant de caelo ut mercede, ideo memorantur inter "pauperes, egenos, peregrinos, pupillos et viduas", ex causa quia in paupertate spirituali sunt; nam genuina vera illis in obscuro sunt, quia lux e caelo per spiritualem hominem in naturalem illorum non influit; inde est quod inter illos memorentur, et quod praecipiatur quod "daretur illis merces antequam sol occidit";

"amare mercedem meretriciam significat jucundum falsificandi et falsi, tum idololatriae, ex amore infernali; "super omnibus areis frumenti" significat omnia Verbi et doctrinae ex Verbo, nam "frumentum", ex quo panis, significat omne quod spiritualiter nutrit, et "area" significat ubi illud collectum est, ita Verbum; "area et torcular non pascet illos" significat quod ex Verbo non haurient bona charitatis et amoris, ita non aliquod quod nutriet animam, nam "area" ibi est Verbum quoad bona charitatis, et "torcular" quoad bona amoris, et per "torcular" intelligitur hic oleum, pro quo et quoque pro vino erant torcularia; "et mustum mentietur illi" significat quod nec aliquod verum boni, nam "mustum", sicut "vinum", significat verum ex bono charitatis et amoris.</p><p>[24] Apud Micham,<p>"Omnia sculptilia" Samariae "contundentur, et omnes mercedes meretriciae ejus comburentur igne, et omnia idola eorum ponam vastitatem, nam ex mercede meretricia congregavit, ideo usque in mercedem meretriciam revertentur;

"ideo in mercedem meretriciam revertentur" significat quod omnia illius ecclesiae vera falsificata erunt, quia inde sunt: "super hoc plangam et ejulabo" significat dolorem angelorum caeli et hominum ecclesiae in quibus ecclesia, et sic apud quos Dominus;
