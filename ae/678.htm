<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 678</h4><p>678. And gave glory to the God of heaven.- That this signifies that they acknowledged and worshipped the Lord, is evident from the signification of giving glory or of glorifying, as denoting to acknowledge and worship, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of the God of heaven, as denoting the Lord. That the Lord is the God of heaven, He himself made clear while He was in the world, and when He departed out of the world. When He was in the world, He said,<p>"The Father hath given all things into the hand" of the Son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The Father hath given to the Son "power over all flesh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_2.htm">17:2</a>).<p>And in Matthew:<p>"All things have been delivered to me by the Father" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_27.htm">11:27</a>).<p>And when He departed out of the world He said to His disciples,<p>"All power is given to me in heaven and on earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">28:18</a>).</p><p>[2] It is evident from these passages that the Lord is the God of heaven. To give glory denotes to acknowledge and worship Him; for to give glory signifies that glory belongs to Him alone, because He is the God of heaven and earth, and acknowledgment also that all things of the church are from Him, thus all salvation and eternal life. From these things it follows, that to give glory and to glorify, when spoken of God, mean to worship and adore Him. Glory, in the Word, when used in reference to the Lord, properly signifies the Divine Truth proceeding from Him, because this Divine Truth is the light of heaven, and from that light angels and men have not only all their intelligence and wisdom, but also all their happiness; and further all magnificence in the heavens, which is ineffable [is from the same source.] This, therefore, is what is properly signified by the glory of God. And because this is glory, it follows, that the glory of the Lord means to enlighten angels and men, to bestow intelligence and wisdom, to bless with happiness and delights, and also to make all things in the heavens magnificent; and it means that this glory is not from the love of glory, but from love towards the human race. The Lord therefore says in John:<p>"In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and may become my disciples" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">15:8</a>);<p>and again,<p>"The words which thou hast given me, I have given unto them, and I am glorified in them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_8.htm">17:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">10</a>).</p><p>[3] That this is the glory of the Lord, is evident from this fact, that the light of heaven, from which are all wisdom, beauty, and magnificence in the heavens, proceeds from the Lord, as the Sun and it is the Divine Love of the Lord that appears to the angels as a sun. It is therefore clear that the light of heaven, which in its essence is Divine Truth and Divine Wisdom, is the proceeding Divine Love; and love desires nothing else than to give that which is its own to another, thus to fill others with blessedness. What then will not the Divine Love do? But the Lord cannot give His glory to anyone, and fill him with wisdom and blessedness, unless He is acknowledged and worshipped, since by this means man conjoins himself to Him in love and faith. For acknowledgment and worship, in order to be acknowledgment and worship, must be from love and faith; and without conjunction by means of these, good cannot possibly flow in from the Lord, because it is not received. From these things it is now evident, that to give glory to the God of heaven, is to acknowledge and worship the Lord.</p><p>[4] That glory signifies the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord, and that the glory of the Lord with man is the reception of Divine Truth, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/33.htm">33</a>, <a href="../ae/345.htm">345</a>). That the glorification of the Lord is from the Lord Himself, and that with men and angels it is reception, and acknowledgment that all good and truth, and everything of salvation and life, are from the Lord, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/288.htm">288</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 678</h4><p>678. And gave glory to the God of heaven, signifies that they acknowledged and worshipped the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "giving glory" or of "glorifying," as being to acknowledge and worship (of which presently); also from the signification of "the God of heaven," as being the Lord. That the Lord is the God of heaven He Himself made clear when He was in the world and when He departed out of the world. When He was in the world He said in John:<p>The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>).<p>The Father hath given to the Son power over all flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>).<p>And in Matthew:<p>All things have been delivered unto Me by the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>).<p>And when He departed out of the world He said to the disciples:<p>All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>From this it is clear that the Lord is the God of heaven.</p><p>[2] "To give glory" means to acknowledge and worship the Lord, because "to give glory" signifies that to Him alone glory belongs because He is the God of heaven and earth, and at the same time to acknowledge that all things of the church are from Him, thus all salvation and eternal life. From this it follows that "to give glory" and "to glorify," in reference to God, mean to worship and to adore Him. In reference to the Lord, "glory" properly signifies in the Word the Divine truth proceeding from Him, for the reason that this Divine truth is the light of heaven, and from that light angels and men have not only all their intelligence and wisdom, but also all their happiness, and besides this, all magnificence in the heavens, which is ineffable; these, therefore, are what are properly signified by "the glory of God;" and because Divine truth is glory it follows that "the glory of the Lord" means to enlighten angels and men, and to bestow intelligence and wisdom, and to bless with felicities and delights, and also to make magnificent all things in the heavens, and that this glory is not from the love of glory, but from love towards the human race. This is why the Lord says in John:<p>Herein is My Father glorified that ye may bear much fruit, and may become My disciples (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>);<p>again:<p>The words which Thou hast given Me I have given unto them, and I am glorified in them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_8.htm">John 17:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">10</a>).</p><p>[3] That this is the glory of the Lord can be seen from this, that the light of heaven, from which is all wisdom, beauty, and magnificence in the heavens, proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and it is the Lord's Divine love that appears to the angels as a sun.

Nevertheless, the Lord cannot give His glory to anyone and fill him with wisdom and blessedness unless he acknowledges and worships the Lord, for it is by this that man conjoins himself to the Lord by love and faith; for in order that acknowledgment and worship may be acknowledgment and worship, it must be from love and faith; and without conjunction by means of these no good can flow in from the Lord, because it is not received.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 678 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>678. "Et dederunt gloriam Deo caeli." - Quod significet quod illi agnoverint et coluerint Dominum, constat ex significatione "dare gloriam" seu "glorificare", quod sit agnoscere et colere (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "Dei caeli", quod sit Dominus. Quod Dominus sit Deus caeli, Ipse dum in mundo fuit, et cum e mundo exivit, manifestavit. Cum in mundo fuit, dixit, apud Johannem,<p>"Pater.... dedit omnia in manum" Filii (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_35" target=_top>3:35</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>Pater dedit Filio "potestatem omnis carnis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_2" target=_top>17:2</a>);<p>et apud Matthaeum,<p>"Omnia Mihi tradita sunt a Patre" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_11_27" target=_top>11:27</a>):<p>et cum e mundo exivit, dixit discipulis,<p>"Data est Mihi omnis potestas in caelo et in terra" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_18" target=_top>Matth. 28:18</a> <sup>1</sup></p><p>):<p>ex quibus patet quod Dominus sit Deus caeli.<p>[2] Quod "gloriam dare" sit agnoscere et colere Ipsum, est quia "gloriam dare" significat quod Ipsi soli sit gloria, quia est Deus caeli et terrae, et simul agnoscere quod omnia ecclesiae sint ab Ipso, ita omnis salus et vita aeterna: ex his sequitur quod "gloriam dare" et "glorificare", cum de Deo, sit colere et adorare Ipsum. "Gloria" in Verbo, ubi de Domino, proprie significat Divinum Verum procedens ab Ipso, ex causa quia Divinum id Verum est lux caeli, et ex luce illa non solum est angelis et hominibus omnis intelligentia et sapientia, sed etiam omnis felicitas, et insuper omnis magnificentia in caelis, quae ineffabilis; haec itaque sunt quae proprie significantur per "gloriam Dei"; et quia id est gloria, sequitur quod gloria Domini sit illustrare angelos et homines, ac donare intelligentia et sapientia, ac beare felicibus et jucundis, et quoque magnificare omnia in caelis; et quod illa gloria non sit ex amore gloriae, sed ex amore erga humanum genus: quare Dominus dicit apud Johannem,<p>"In hoc glorificatus est Pater meus, ut fructum multum feratis, et reddamini discipuli mei" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_8" target=_top>15:8</a>);<p>et alibi,<p>"Verba quae dedisti Mihi, dedi illis et glorificatus sum in illis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_8" target=_top>17:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_10" target=_top>10</a>).<p>[3] Quod hoc sit gloria Domini, constare potest ex eo, quod lux caeli, ex qua omnis sapientia, pulchritudo, et magnificentia est in caelis, procedat a Domino ut Sole, ac Divinus Amor Domini est qui apparet angelis ut Sol; inde constat quod lux caeli, quae in sua essentia est Divinum Verum ac Divina Sapientia, sit Divinus Amor procedens; ac amor non aliud vult quam dare id quod suum est alteri, ita implere alios beatitudine; quid non Divinus Amor? At dare alicui gloriam suam, et implere sapientia et beatitudine, non potest Dominus, nisi agnoscatur et colatur; per hoc enim conjungit se homo Ipsi amore et fide; nam agnitio et cultus, ut sit agnitio et cultus, erit ex amore et fide; et absque conjunctione per illa non potest influere aliquod bonum a Domino, quia non recipitur. Ex his nunc patet quod "dare gloriam Deo caeli" sit agnoscere et colere Dominum.<p>[4] Quod "gloria" significet Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, et quod Domini gloria apud hominem sit receptio Divini Veri, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_33" target=_top>33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_345" target=_top>345</a> <sup>2</sup></p><p>). Quod glorificatio Domini sit ab Ipso Domino, et quod apud homines et angelos sit receptio et agnitio, quod omne bonum et verum ac omne salutis et vitae sit a Domino, etiam supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_678/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_288" target=_top>288</a> [a]).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
