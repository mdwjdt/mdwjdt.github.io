<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 219</h4><p>219. (Verse 12) He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. That this signifies that those who persevere will be in Divine truth in heaven is evident from the signification of overcoming, as denoting to persevere in the genuine affection of truth (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/128.htm">128</a>); in this case, in faith from charity, because that faith is treated of in what is written to the angel of this church (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/203.htm">203</a>); and from the signification of pillar, as denoting Divine truth sustaining; also from the signification of the temple of my God, as being, in the highest sense, the Divine Human of the Lord, and, in the relative sense, the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, thus the heaven constituting that kingdom, which will be treated of in what follows. The reason why a pillar in the temple denotes Divine truth sustaining, is that temple signifies heaven, and heaven is heaven from the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord. For by heaven are meant all the angels, because these constitute heaven, whence it is called heaven; and they are angels in so far as they receive the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord: hence angels in the Word also signify Divine truth (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/200.htm">200</a>). Now because heaven is Divine truth, and since temple signifies heaven, it follows that all the things of the temple signify those things that belong to Divine truth, and that the pillars therein signify Divine truth sustaining.<p>Divine truths sustaining are, in general, truths of a lower degree, because these sustain those of a higher degree; for there are Divine truths lower and higher, as there are heavens lower and higher; thus there are degrees of the same (see in the work, <a href="../hh/38.htm">Heaven and Hell 38</a>, <a href="../hh/208.htm">208</a>, <a href="../hh/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../hh/211.htm">211</a>). The heavens which exist in a lower degree sustain those of a higher degree; here, therefore, by the Lord's making him that overcometh a pillar in the temple is signified that they will be in the lower heaven. Those who are in the faith of charity also are in the lower heaven, which is called the spiritual heaven; but those who are in love to the Lord are in the higher heaven, which is called the celestial heaven, and this is sustained by the lower or spiritual heaven. (How these things are, may be more clearly seen, as they are shown in three articles, in the work, Heaven and Hell, that is, in the article where it is shown that the Divine of the Lord in heaven is love to Him and charity towards the neighbour, n. <a href="../hh/13.htm">13-19</a>; in another, where it is shown that heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual, n. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>; and in a third, where it is shown that there are three heavens, 29-40.)</p><p>[2] Pillars are mentioned in various parts of the Word, and thereby are signified truths of a lower degree, because they sustain those of a higher degree. That the former truths are signified in the Word by pillars is evident from the following passages. In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, I have given thee this day for a defenced city, and for a pillar of iron, and for walls of brass against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes, and against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land, that they may fight against thee and not prevail" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_1_18.htm">1:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_1_19.htm">19</a>).<p>These things were said to the prophet, because by all the prophets are signified the doctrines of Divine truth; and because the subject here treated of is the church in which Divine truths are falsified, it is therefore said: "Behold, I have given thee this day for a defenced city, and a pillar of iron and walls of brass against the whole land."<p>By a defenced city is signified the doctrine of truth; by a pillar of iron, truth sustaining it; by walls of brass, the good which defends; and by land, the church. It is said, also, "Against the kings of Judah, against the princes, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land"; and by the kings of Judah, and by princes, are signified truths falsified; by priests, goods adulterated; and by the people of the land, falsities in general; concerning which it is intimated that they should fight against truths but should not prevail.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>"Appoint unto thee signs, place for thyself pillars, set thine heart to the narrow way; go the way; return, O virgin of Israel! return to thy cities" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">31:21</a>).<p>The restitution of the church is here treated of. The virgin of Israel signifies the church; to appoint signs, and to place pillars, signifies instruction in those things that are the fundamentals of the church, called pillars because they sustain; to set the heart to the narrow way signifies the affection of truth leading to life.</p><p>[4] In David:<p>"I will judge in uprightness the faint of the earth, and all the inhabitants thereof; I will establish the pillars thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_2.htm">Psalms 75:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_3.htm">3</a>).<p>Here, by the faint of the earth are signified those of the church who are not in truths, but who nevertheless desire them. To establish, or strengthen, the pillars of the earth signifies to support the church by those truths upon which it is founded. In Job:<p>"Who maketh the earth to tremble out of its place, so that the pillars thereof tremble" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_9_6.htm">Job 9:6</a>).<p>By the earth is here signified the church, and by pillars the truths which sustain it. That by "the pillar of the court of the tent," mentioned in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_10.htm">Exodus 27:10-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_14.htm">14-17</a>, are also signified lower truths sustaining higher ones, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, in the explanation of that chapter and those verses. Similar truths are signified by the pillars of the house of the forest of Lebanon, built by Solomon, mentioned in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_6.htm">6</a>.</p><p>[5] Such also is the signification of the two pillars which Solomon erected in the porch of the temple, and which are thus described in the first book of Kings.<p>He "formed two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubits did compass the second pillar about. And he made two crowns of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: seven for the one crown, and seven for the other crown. And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_15.htm">7:15-22</a>).<p>Because the temple signified heaven, as will be shown presently, therefore all the things of the temple signified the things of heaven, thus those of the Divine truth; for, as said above, heaven is heaven from the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; its porch signified the things of the ultimate heaven, and because this sustains the two higher heavens, therefore those two pillars were placed in the porch. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 219</h4><p>219. Verse 12. He that overcometh I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, signifies that those who are steadfast will be in Divine truth in heaven. This is evident from the signification of "overcoming," as being to be steadfast in the genuine affection of truth (See above n. <a href="../ae/128.htm">128</a>); here in faith from charity, since that faith is treated of in what is written the angel of this church see <a href="../ae/203.htm">203</a>; also from the signification of "pillar" as being Divine truth sustaining; also from the signification of "the temple of God" as being in the highest sense, the Lord's Divine Human, and in the relative sense, the Lord's spiritual kingdom, thus the heaven that constitutes that kingdom (of which presently). "A pillar in the temple" means Divine truth sustaining, because "temple" signifies heaven, and heaven is heaven from the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; for by heaven all angels are meant, because heaven is made up of angels, and from them is called heaven: and angels are angels in the measure in which they receive the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; and for this reason angels in the Word also signify Divine truths (See above, n. <a href="../ae/130.htm">130</a>, <a href="../ae/200.htm">200</a>).<p>Now as heaven is Divine truth, and "temple" signifies heaven, it follows that all things of the temple signify such things as pertain to Divine truth, and that the "pillars" therein signify Divine truths sustaining. Divine truths sustaining are in general lower truths, because these sustain the higher; for there are lower and higher Divine truths, as there are lower and higher heavens. (There are degrees of these, on w (<a href="../hh/38.htm">Heaven and Hell 38</a>) (<a href="../hh/208.htm">Heaven and Hell 208-209</a>) (<a href="../hh/211.htm">Heaven and Hell 211</a>) hich see in the work on <a href="../hh/38.htm">Heaven and Hell 38</a>, <a href="../hh/208.htm">208</a>, <a href="../hh/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../hh/211.htm">211</a>.) The heavens that belong to a lower degree sustain those that belong to a higher degree; here, therefore, by the Lord's making him that overcometh "a pillar in the temple" is meant that such will be in a lower heaven. They who are in the faith of charity are also in the lower heaven, which is called the spiritual heaven; while those who are in love to the Lord are in the higher heaven, which is called the celestial heaven, and this is sustained by the lower or spiritual heaven. (But a clearer idea can be had of these things from what is shown in three chapters in the work on Heaven and Hell, namely, in the chapter where it is shown that The Divine of the Lord in Heaven is Love to Him and Charity towards the Neighbor, n. <a href="../hh/13.htm">13-19</a>; in another where it is shown that Heaven is distinguished into Two Kingdoms, Celestial and Spiritual, n <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>; and in a third where it is shown that There are Three Heavens, n. <a href="../hh/29.htm">29-40</a>.)</p><p>[2] "Pillars" are here and there mentioned in the Word, and they signify lower truths, because they sustain the higher. That lower truths are signified by "pillars" in the Word can be seen from the following. In Jeremiah:<p>Behold I have given thee this day for a fenced city, and for a pillar of iron, and for walls of brass against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes and against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land, that they may fight against thee and not prevail (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_1_18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18-19</a>).<p>These things were said to the prophet, because all prophets signify the doctrines of Divine truth, and because the church in which Divine truths are falsified is here treated of it is therefore said, "Behold I have given thee this day for a fenced city, for a pillar of iron, and for walls of brass against the whole land;" "a fenced city" signifies the doctrine of truth; "a pillar of iron" truth sustaining it; "walls of brass" good defending, and "land" the church. It is said, also, "against the kings of Judah, against the princes, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land;" and "the kings of Judah," and "princes," signify truths falsified; "priests," goods adulterated, and "the people of the land," falsities in general; of these it is said, that they will fight against truths themselves, but shall not prevail.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>Set thee up signs, place for thee high pillars, set thine heart to the highway, the way thou mayest go; return, O virgin of Israel, return to thy cities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21</a>).<p>The restoration of the church is here treated of. "The virgin of Israel" signifies the church; "to set up signs, and to place high pillars," signifies instruction in such things as are the fundamentals of the church, which are called "high pillars" because they sustain: "to set the heart to the highway, the way thou mayest go," signifies the affection of truth leading to life.</p><p>[4] In David:<p>I will judge in uprightness; the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved; I will make firm the pillars of it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_2.htm">Psalms 75:2-3</a>).<p>"The earth dissolving" signifies those of the church who are not in truths but yet long for them; "to make firm the pillars" of it signifies to sustain the church by those truths upon which it is founded. Again, in Job:<p>Who causeth the earth to shake out of its place, so that the pillars thereof tremble (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_9_6.htm">Job 9:6</a>).<p>"The earth" here signifies the church, and "pillars" the truths that sustain it. That:<p>The pillars of the court of the tabernacle (mentioned in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_10.htm">Exodus 27:10-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_27_14.htm">14-17</a>);<p>also signify the ultimate truths sustaining the higher ones, see Arcana Coelestia, in the explanation of that chapter and those verses. Like truths are signified by:<p>The pillars of the house of the forest of Lebanon built by Solomon (mentioned in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_6.htm">6</a>).</p><p>[5] Similar also is the signification of:<p>The two pillars that Solomon set up in the porch of the temple, and that are described in the first book of Kings. He fashioned two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits was the height of each pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the second pillar. And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; seven chains for the one chapiter, and seven chains for the other chapiter. And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof Boaz (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_7_15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-21</a>).<p>Since "the temple" signified heaven (as will be shown presently), therefore all things of the temple signified such things as are of heaven, thus of Divine truth there; for, as said above, heaven is heaven from the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; therefore "the porch of the temple" signified the things pertaining to the ultimate heaven, and as this sustains the two higher heavens, those two pillars were placed in the porch. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 219 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>219. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_12" target=_top>12</a>.) "Vincens, faciam illum columnam in templo Dei mei." - Quod significet quod qui permanent, erunt in Divino Vero in caelo, constat ex significatione "vincere", quod sit permanere in genuina affectione veri (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_128" target=_top>128</a>); hic in fide ex charitate, quia de illa in scriptis ad Angelum hujus Ecclesiae agitur (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_203" target=_top>203</a>): ex significatione "columnae", quod sit Divinum Verum sustentans; et ex significatione "templi Dei", quod in supremo sensu sit Divinum Humanum Domini, et in sensu respectivo regnum spirituale Domini, ita caelum quod id regnum constituit (de qua sequitur). <p>Quod "columna in templo" sit Divinum Verum sustentans, est quia "templum" significat caelum, et caelum est caelum ex Divino Vero quod procedit a Domino: per caelum enim intelliguntur omnes angeli, nam angeli faciunt caelum, et ab angelis dicitur caelum; et illi tantum sunt angeli quantum recipiunt Divinum Verum quod procedit a Domino; quapropter etiam "angeli" in Verbo significant Divina vera (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_130" target=_top>130</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_200" target=_top>200</a>): quia nunc caelum est Divinum Verum, et "templum" significat caelum, sequitur quod omnia templi significent talia quae sunt Divini Veri, et quod "columnae" ibi Divina vera sustentantia. Divina vera sustentantia sunt in genere vera inferiora, quia illa sustentant superiora; sunt enim Divina vera inferiora et superiora, sicut sunt caeli inferiores et superiores: sunt gradus illorum (de quibus videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_38" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 38</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_208" target=_top>208</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_209" target=_top>209</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_211" target=_top>211</a>). Caeli qui in inferiori gradu sunt, illi sustentant caelos qui in superiori; hic itaque per quod Dominus facturus sit illum "columnam in templo", significatur quod in caelo inferiori erunt. Sunt etiam illi qui in fide charitatis in caelo inferiori, quod caelum vocatur caelum spirituale; at qui in amore in Dominum sunt, in caelo superiori sunt, quod caelum vocatur caelum caeleste, et hoc sustentatur a caelo inferiori seu spirituali. (Sed de his clarior idea haberi potest ex illis quae in opere De Caelo et Inferno, in tribus articulis ostensa sunt; nempe in articulo ubi ostensum, Quod Divinum Domini in Caelo sit Amor in Ipsum et Charitas erga Proximum, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_13" target=_top>13-19</a>; in altero ubi ostensum, Quod Caelum distinctum sit in duo Regna, caeleste et spirituale, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_20" target=_top>20-28</a>; et in tertio ubi ostensum, Quod tres Caeli sint, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_29" target=_top>29-40</a>.)<p>[2] In Verbo passim memorantur "columnae", et per illas significantur vera inferiora, ex causa quia sustentant superiora; quod illa significentur per "columnas" in Verbo, constare potest a sequentibus his locis:<p>- Apud Jeremiam,<p>"Ecce dedi te hodie in urbem munitam, et in columnam ferri, et in muros aeris contra universam terram, contra reges Jehudae, contra principes, et contra sacerdotes ejus, et contra populum terrae, ut pugnent contra te et non praevaleant" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_1_18" target=_top>1:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_1_19" target=_top>19</a>);<p>haec dicta sunt ad Prophetam, quia per omnes "prophetas" significantur doctrinae Divini Veri, et quia agitur ibi de ecclesia in qua Divina vera falsificata sunt; ideo dicitur, "Dedi te hodie in urbem munitam, in columnam ferri, et in muros aeris contra universam terram": per "urbem munitam" significatur doctrina veri, per "columnam ferri" verum sustentans illam, per "muros aeris" bonum tutans, et per "terram" ecclesia: dicitur etiam "contra reges Jehudae, contra principes, contra sacerdotes ejus, et contra populum terrae"; ac per "reges Jehudae" ac per "principes" significantur vera falsificata, per "sacerdotes" bona adulterata, et per "populum terrae" falsa in genere; de his dicitur quod pugnatura sint contra ipsa vera sed non praevalitura.<p>[3] Apud eundem,<p>"Constitue tibi signa, pone tibi columnas, appone cor tuum ad semitam, viam eas, revertere virgo Israel, revertere ad urbes tuas " (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_21" target=_top>31:21</a>):<p>agitur ibi de ecclesiae restitutione; "virgo Israel" significat ecclesiam; "constituere signa et ponere columnas" significat instructionem in talibus quae fundamentalia ecclesiae sunt, quae quia sustentant vocantur "columnae"; "appone cor ad semitam, viam eas", significat affectionem veri ducentis ad vitam.<p>[4] Apud Davidem,<p>"Ego rectitudinibus judicabo, liquescentes terrae, et omnes habitatores ejus; firmabo columnas ejus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_75_3" target=_top>Psalms 75:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_75_4" target=_top>4</a> [B.A. 2, [3]):<p>"liquescentes terrae" significant illos ab ecclesia qui non in veris sunt sed usque desiderant illa; "firmare columnas" ejus significat suffulcire veris super quibus ecclesia fundatur.<p>Apud Hiobum,<p>Qui tremefacit terram e loco suo, ita ut columnae ejus contremiscant" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_219/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_9_6" target=_top>9:6</a>):<p>per "terram" ibi significatur ecclesia, et per "columnas" significantur vera sustentantia illam.
