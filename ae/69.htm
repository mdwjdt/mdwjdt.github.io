<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 69</h4><p>69. (Verse 15) And his feet like, unto burnished brass, as if they burned in a furnace. That this signifies the ultimate of Divine order which is the Natural, full of Divine love, is evident from the signification of feet, as being the Natural (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2162.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2162</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4938.htm">4938-4952</a>); when therefore it is said of the Lord, it denotes the ultimate of Divine order, because that is the Natural. It is also evident from the signification of burnished brass, or polished brass, as denoting natural good, concerning which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of burning, when said of the Lord, as denoting that it is from the Divine love (concerning which see n. 10055). It is said, as if they burned in a furnace, in order that the Divine love may be expressed in the greatest degree, and in its fullness; for the Divine is in its fulness when it is in its ultimate, and the ultimate is the Natural (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/66.htm">66</a>). It is clear then, that by His feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, is signified the ultimate of Divine order, which is the Natural, full of Divine love. These things, as also those that precede, are spoken comparatively; as that His head and His hairs were white as white wool, as snow, and that His feet were like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; but it is to be observed, that all comparisons in the Word are significative, because in the same way as the things themselves, they are from correspondences (as may be seen, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3579.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3579</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4599.htm">4599</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8989.htm">8989</a>).</p><p>[2] The reason why feet, when said of the Lord, signify the ultimate of Divine order, and that this is the Natural, is, that heaven is heaven from the Divine Human of the Lord, and that therefore heaven in the aggregate has reference to one Man. And, because there are three heavens, that the highest heaven has reference to the head, the middle heaven to the body, and the ultimate heaven to the feet. The Divine which constitutes the highest heaven is called the celestial Divine; that which constitutes the middle heaven is called the spiritual Divine, and that which constitutes the ultimate heaven is called the natural Divine from the spiritual and celestial. It is therefore clear why the Lord is in this place described as to His Divine Human, which is the Son of man, seen in the midst of the lampstands, not only as to His garments, but also as to His head, His chest and feet. (That the Son of man is the Lord as to the Divine Human, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>; and that the lampstands denote heaven, may be seen n. 62. But as these things are arcana hitherto unknown in the world, and nevertheless ought to be understood in order that the internal sense of this and the following parts of this prophetical book may be comprehended, they are therefore particularly and specifically described in the work, Heaven and Hell; as, that the Divine Human of the Lord constitutes heaven, n. <a href="../hh/7.htm">7-12</a>, <a href="../hh/78.htm">78-86</a>; that hence heaven in the aggregate has reference to one Man, n. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-77</a>; that there are three heavens, and that the highest refers to the head, the middle to the body, and the ultimate to the feet, n. <a href="../hh/29.htm">29-40</a>.)<p>When these things are understood, it will be evident that by the feet of Jehovah, or of the Lord, in the Word, is signified the ultimate of Divine order, or the Natural; and because the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, is the ultimate of Divine order in the church, and is the Natural, therefore this is specifically signified by the feet of Jehovah, or of the Lord.</p><p> [3] It was for this reason that, when the Lord was seen as an angel by the prophets, in other places, He was seen by them also in a similar manner. Thus by Daniel:<p>"I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; his body also was like the beryl, and his eyes as torches of fire his arms and his feet as the brightness of polished brass" (<a href="../ae/36.htm">36</a>; and because cloud denotes the external of the Word, it also denotes the external of the church and of worship, for the church and worship are from the Word. It is said the dust of His feet, because those things which are in the sense of the letter of the Word, which sense is natural, appear scattered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 69</h4><p>69. Verse 15. And His feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace, signifies the ultimate of Divine order, which is the natural, full of Divine love. This is evident from the signification of "feet," as being the natural (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2162.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2162</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4938.htm">4938-4952</a>); therefore, in reference to the Lord, as meaning the ultimate of Divine order, because that is the natural; also from the signification of "burnished brass," or brass polished, as being natural good (of which presently); and from the signification of "glowing," as being, in reference to the Lord, what is from Divine love (See n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10055.htm">10055</a>). It is said, "as if glowing in a furnace," in order that the Divine love in the greatest degree and in its fullness may be represented, for the Divine is in its fullness when it is in its ultimate, and the ultimate is the natural (See above, n. <a href="../ae/66.htm">66</a>).<p>From this it is clear that by "His feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace," is signified the ultimate of Divine order, which is the natural, full of Divine love. These things, as well as the preceding, are described by comparisons; as that "His head and His hairs were white as white wool, as snow," and that "His feet were like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace;" but it is to be noted, that all comparisons in the Word are significative, for they are from correspondences in like manner as the things themselves (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3579.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3579</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4599.htm">4599</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8989.htm">8989</a>).</p><p>[2] In reference to the Lord, "feet" signify the ultimate of Divine order, and this is the natural, because heaven is heaven from the Lord's Divine Human, and from this it is that heaven in the whole complex represents one man; and as there are three heavens, that the highest heaven represents the head, the middle heaven the body, and the lowest heaven the feet. The Divine that makes the highest heaven is called the celestial Divine, but the Divine that makes the middle heaven is called the spiritual Divine, and the Divine that makes the lowest heaven is called the natural Divine from the spiritual and celestial. This makes it evident why the Lord is here described in respect to His Divine Human, which is the Son of man seen in the midst of the lampstands, not only as regards His garments, but also as to His head, breast, and feet. (That the Son of man is the Lord as to His Divine Human, see above, n. <a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>; and that the "lampstands" are heaven, see n. <a href="../ae/62.htm">62</a>, <a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>. But since these things are arcana hitherto unknown in the world, and yet must be understood in order that the internal sense of this and the following parts of this prophetical book may be comprehended, the particulars have been explained specifically in the work on Heaven and Hell; as<p>That the Divine Human of the Lord makes Heaven, n. <a href="../hh/7.htm">7-12</a>, <a href="../hh/78.htm">78-86</a>, seq.;<p>That on this account Heaven in the whole Complex represents one Man, n. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-77</a>;<p>That there are Three Heavens, and that the highest refers to the head, the middle to the body, and the lowest to the feet, n. <a href="../hh/29.htm">Heaven and Hell 29-40</a>.)<p>When this is understood it can be seen what is signified in the Word by "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord," namely, the ultimate of Divine order, or the natural; and since the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word is the ultimate of Divine order in the church, and is the natural, this is specifically signified by "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord."</p><p>[3] Because of this signification of "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord," therefore when the Lord was seen as an Angel by the prophets elsewhere, He appeared in like manner.<p>Thus by Daniel:<p>I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; His body was like the tarshish stone, and His eyes as lamps of fire, and His arms and His feet like the brightness of polished brass (<a href="../njhd/248.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>).</p><p>[4] Since "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord" signify the ultimate of Divine order, and this specifically is the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, therefore this external is called in the Word "His footstool," as in Isaiah:<p>The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; I will make the place of My feet honorable. And they shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet (<a href="../ae/36.htm">36</a>). Because "cloud" is the external of the Word, it is also the external of the church and of worship; for the church and worship are from the Word. "Clouds" are called "dust of His feet," because those things that are in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural, appear scattered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 69 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>69. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_15" target=_top>15</a>.) "Et pedes Ipsius similes chalcolibano tanquam in camino igniti." - Quod significet ultimum ordinis Divini quod naturale, plenum Divino Amore, constat ex significatione "pedum", quod sint naturale (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2162" target=_top>2162</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3147" target=_top>3147</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3761" target=_top>3761</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3986" target=_top>3986</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4280" target=_top>4280</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4938" target=_top>4938-4952</a>); inde, cum de Domino, quod sint ultimum ordinis Divini, quia id est naturale; ex significatione "chalcolibani", seu aeris levigati, quod sit bonum naturale (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "igniti", cum de Domino, quod sit quod ex Divino Amore (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10055" target=_top>AC 10055</a>). Dicitur "tanquam in camino igniti", ut exprimatur Divinus Amor in maximo gradu, et in suo pleno; nam Divinum est in suo pleno cum in suo ultimo, et ultimum est naturale (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_66" target=_top>66</a>). Inde patet, quod per "pedes Ipsius similes chalcolibano tanquam in camino ignitos", significetur ultimum ordinis Divini quod naturale, plenum Divino Amore. Dicuntur haec, ut quoque praecedentia, comparative; ut quod "caput et capilli candidi esset tanquans lana candida, tanquam nix", et quod "pedes essent similes chalcolibano tanquam in camino igniti"; sed sciendum est quod omnes comparationes in Verbo significent, quia similiter ac ipsae res sunt ex correspondentiis (videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3579" target=_top>3579</a>, <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4599" target=_top>AC 4599</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8989" target=_top>8989</a>).<p>[2] Quod "pedes", cum de Domino, significent ultimum ordinis Divini, et quod hoc sit naturale, est quia caelum est caelum ex Divino Humano Domini, et quod inde caelum in toto complexu referat unum Hominem; et quia tres caeli sunt, quod supremum caelum referat caput, medium corpus, et ultimum pedes. Divinum quod facit supremum caelum vocatur Divinum caeleste, Divinum autem quod facit medium caelum vocatur Divinum spirituale, ac Divinum quod facit ultimum caelum vocatur Divinum naturale ex spirituali et caelesti: inde patet causa, cur hic describitur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, quod est Filius hominis visus in medio candelabrorum, non modo quoad vestes, sed etiam quoad caput, et pectus, et pedes. <p>(Quod "Filius hominis" sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_63" target=_top>63</a>; et quod "candelabra" sint caelum, etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_62" target=_top>62</a>. Sed haec quia arc1na sunt, hactenus in mundo ignota, et tamen sint quae intelligenda ut comprehendatur sensus internus horum, et sequentium in libro hoc prophetico, ideo singilla descripta sunt in specie in opere De Caelo et Inferno: ut, Quod Divinum Humanum Domini faciat Caelum, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_7" target=_top>7-12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_78" target=_top>78-86</a>, seq. Quod inde Caelum in toto complexu referat unum Hominem, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59" target=_top>59-77</a>. Quod tres Caeli sint, et quod supremum referat caput, medium corpus, et ultimum pedes, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_29" target=_top>29-40</a>.) Ex his inde intellectis constare potest quid significatur per "pedes Jehovae" seu "Domini" in Verbo, quod nempe ultimum ordinis Divini seu naturale; et quia externum ecclesiae, cultus et Verbi est ultimum ordinis Divini in ecclesia, et est naturale, ideo hoc per "pedes Jehovae" seu "Domini" in specie significatur.<p>[3] Quia id per "pedes Jehovae" seu "Domini" significatur, ideo cum Dominus sicut Angelus visus prophetis alibi, etiam similiter visus est; ut Danieli:<p>"Sustuli oculos meos et vidi; ecce Vir indutus linteis, cujus lumbi cincti auro Uphasi, corpus Ejus sicut Tharschisch;... et oculi Ejus sicut faces ignis; brachia Ejus et pedes Ejus sicut splendor aeris levigati" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_10_5" target=_top>10:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_10_6" target=_top>6</a>).<p>Similiter cherubi, per quos intelligitur Dominus quoad providentiam et custodiam (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9277" target=_top>9277</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9509" target=_top>9509</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9673" target=_top>9673</a>), visi sunt Ezechieli:<p>"Pedes eorum erant... micantes sicut splendor aeris levigati" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_7" target=_top>1:7</a>).<p>Similiter Dominus visus ut Angelus postea in Apocalypsi:<p>"Vidi Angelum descendentem de caelo, amictum nube, et iris circum caput, et facies Ejus ut sol, et pedes Ejus tanquam columnae ignis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_10_1" target=_top>10:1</a>).<p>Quia talis visus est Dominus quoad pedes, ideo sub pedibus visus est quibusdam ex filiis Israelis,<p>"Sicut opus lapidis sapphiri, et quasi substantia caeli quoad puritatem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_24_10" target=_top>Exodus 24:10</a>);<p>quod Dominus illis non visus sit quoad pedes sed "sub pedibus", erat causa quia non in externo ecclesiae, cultus et Verbi erant, sed sub illo (videatur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_248" target=_top>248</a>).<p>[4] Quoniam "pedes Jehovae" seu "Domini significant ultimum ordinis Divini, et hoc in specie est externum ecclesiae, cultus et Verbi, ideo hoc in Verbo vocatur "scabellum pedum Ipsius": <p>- Ut apud Esaiam,<p>"Gloria Libani ad Te veniet ad decorandum locum sanctuarii mei, locum pedum meorum honorabilem reddam;... et incurvabunt se ad volas pedum tuorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_13" target=_top>60:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_14" target=_top>14</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Caelum thronus meus. et terra scabellum pedum meorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_1" target=_top>66:1</a>);<p>apud Jeremiam,<p>Deus "non recordatur scabelli pedum suorum in die irae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_2_1" target=_top>Jeremiam 2:1</a>);<p>apud Davidem,<p>"Adorate Jehovam Versus scabellum pedum Ipsius" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_99_5" target=_top>Psalms 99:5</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Intrabimus in habitacula Ipsius, incurvabimus nos scabello pedum Ipsius" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_7" target=_top>Psalms 132:7</a>);<p>apud Nahum,<p>"Jehovae... nubes pulvis pedum Ipsius" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_nahum_1_3" target=_top>1:3</a>);<p>quod "nubes" sit externum Verbi, seu Verbum quoad litteram, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_69/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_36" target=_top>36</a>);
