<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 88</h4><p>88. (Verse 20) The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand. That this signifies revelation concerning goods and truths, which are all from Him, is evident from the signification of mystery, as being what lies concealed in the vision which John had, but here that vision revealed, because in what immediately follows it is said what is meant by the seven stars and the seven lampstands; and from the signification of the seven stars, as being the knowledges (cognitiones) of all things pertaining to good and truth, and hence all goods and truths (concerning which, see above, n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>); and from the signification of in my right hand, when said of the Lord, as being what is from Him (concerning which see also, n. 72); hence it is clear, that by the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest, is signified revelation concerning goods and truths, which are all from Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 88</h4><p>88. Verse 20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, signifies revelation concerning goods and truths, which are all from Him. This is evident from the signification of "mystery," as being what lies concealed in the vision that John had, but here that vision revealed, since in what now follows it is told what is meant by the "seven stars" and by the "seven lampstands." This is evident also from the signification of the "seven stars," as being the knowledges of all things of good and truth, and thence all goods and truths (See above, n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>); and from the signification of "in My right hand," as meaning, in reference to the Lord, what is from Him (See also, n. <a href="../ae/72.htm">72</a>. From this it is clear that by "the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest" is signified the revelation of goods and truths, which are all from Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 88 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>88. (Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_20" target=_top>20</a>.) "Mysterium septem stellarum quas vidisti in dextra mea." Quod significet revelationem de bonis et veris quae omnia ab Ipso; constat ex significatione "mysterii", quod sit quod reconditum latet in visione quae Johanni; hic autem id revelatum, quoniam in nunc sequentibus dicitur quid intellectum est per "septem stellas" et per "Septem candelabra"; et ex significatione "septem stellarum", quod sint cognitiones omnium boni et veri, et inde omnia bona et vera (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_88/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_72" target=_top>72</a>); et ex significatione "in dextra", cum de Domino, quod sit quod ab Ipso (de qua etiam, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_88/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_72" target=_top>72</a>): inde patet, quod per "mysterium septem stellarum quas vidisti", significetur revelatio de bonis et veris quae omnia ab Ipso. </p>
