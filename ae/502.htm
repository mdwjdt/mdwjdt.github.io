<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 502</h4><p>502. And the first angel sounded.- This signifies influx out of heaven, and thence the first change, as is evident from the signification of sounding a trumpet, as denoting the influx of Divine Truth out of heaven; and because the first change resulting therefrom is now described, therefore this is also signified. To sound the trumpet signifies the influx of Divine Truth out of heaven, because when the Divine Truth flows down out of heaven, it is sometimes heard in the spiritual world as the sound of a horn [buccina], and as the clangour of a trumpet [tuba]; and by those who stand below there are also seen as it were angels having trumpets. But these things are representations and appearances, such as exist beneath the heavens, for it is the Divine Truth descending or flowing down out of heaven towards the lower parts, that is represented in this manner. This now is the reason that to sound a trumpet signifies the flowing down of the Divine Truth out of heaven.</p><p>[2] This flowing down, when powerful, produces one effect with the good and another with the evil. With the good, it enlightens the understanding, conjoins them more closely with heaven, and consequently gladdens and vivifies their minds; but with the evil it causes a disturbance of the understanding, separates them from heaven, conjoins them more closely with hell, carries terror to their minds, and at length induces spiritual death. It is therefore evident, that to sound a trumpet, signifies in regard to the effect, revelation and manifestation of Divine Truth, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/55.htm">55</a>, <a href="../ae/262.htm">262</a>), and in the opposite sense, the deprivation of truth, and desolation. Since it is now said that the angels sounded seven times, it is necessary to show from the Word the signification of sounding, and thence why it is said that the angels sounded.</p><p>[3] That to sound with trumpets (tuba) and horns (buccina) signifies the revelation of Divine Truth, and its manifestation, is evident from the sound of a trumpet being heard when Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai and promulgated the law; concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were voices and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon Mount Sinai, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled when Jehovah descended upon them in fire; and the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah, to gaze, and many of them perish" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16-21</a>).<p>The law which was promulgated at that time, signifies the Divine Truth; the voice of the trumpet represented the descent of that truth out of heaven, and its manifestation. The voice of the trumpet sounding long, and waxing louder, represented [Divine Truth] increasing toward the lower parts, for it is said that the people stood on the lower parts of the mount. The people trembling, and charged not to approach nearer to the mount lest they should perish, signified the effect of the flowing down of Divine Truth with people of such a nature and quality as the sons of Jacob were. It is evident that they were altogether evil interiorly, for they worshipped the golden calf after a month of days, and they would have perished if they had not stood afar off; hence their terror of death.</p><p>[4] That to sound with horns and trumpets represented and thence signified the Divine Truth descending and flowing in out of heaven, is plain from the institution and use of trumpets among the sons of Israel. It was commanded that trumpets should be made of silver, and that the sons of Aaron should sound them for the assemblies, for their journeyings, on days of gladness, at the feast, at the beginnings of months, over the sacrifices, for a memorial and for war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1551.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5658.htm">5658</a>). The reason why the sons of Aaron sounded with them, was, that Aaron himself, as the chief priest, represented the Lord as the Divine Good, and his sons, the Lord as to the Divine Truth (see the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9806.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9806</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9807.htm">9807</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9966.htm">9966</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10017.htm">10017</a>). They were sounded for the assemblies and journeyings, because it is the Divine Truth which calls together, gathers together, teaches the way, and leads. They were sounded on the day of gladness, at the feasts, in the beginning of months, and over the sacrifices, because the Divine Truth, descending out of heaven, forms and fills with gladness what is holy in worship. They were sounded also for war and for battle, to signify that the Divine Truth flowing down out of heaven strikes with the terror of death, puts to flight, and scatters the evil who are called in the Word enemies. In this sense, and on account of this effect, it is here said, that the seven angels sounded in their order.</p><p>[5] Since it was commanded that they should sound with trumpets for their assemblies, therefore it is said by the Lord, in Matthew,<p>"He shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">24:31</a>).<p>By the angels with a great sound of a trumpet is here signified the Divine Truth to be revealed at the consummation of the age, that is, when the end of the church should come.</p><p>[6] And in Isaiah:<p>"In that day, the great trumpet shall be blown, and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt, and shall worship Jehovah in the mountain of holiness at Jerusalem" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">27:13</a>).<p>These things were said concerning the coming of the Lord. A calling together to the church, and salvation by the Lord, are signified by the great trumpet being sounded in that day, and by the coming of those that were perishing in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt. To sound the trumpet signifies the Divine Truth calling together and saving; those who were perishing in the land of Assyria, are those who are deceived by false reasonings, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt, are those who are deceived by scientifics, thus the Gentiles who were in falsities from ignorance of the truth. That they will adore the Lord from love, and in truth, is signified by the words "and shall worship Jehovah in the mountain of holiness at Jerusalem." The mountain of holiness signifies the church as to the good of love, consequently also the good of love of the church; and Jerusalem signifies the church as to the truth of doctrine, consequently the truth of the doctrine of the church. It is therefore evident, that to sound with the trumpet signifies the Divine Truth descending out of heaven.</p><p>[7] Since the Divine Truth descending from the Lord through the heavens gladdens the heart, and infills worship with what is holy, and therefore the trumpets were sounded on the days of gladness, and in the feasts, it is therefore said in David:<p>"Sing unto Jehovah with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody. With trumpets and sound of the horn make a joyful noise before Jehovah, the King" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_98_5.htm">Psalm 98:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_98_6.htm">6</a>).<p>And in Zephaniah:<p>"Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_3_14.htm">3:14</a>).<p>This is spoken of the establishment of the church by the Lord. The trumpets, the sound of the horn, and the making of a joyful noise, signify joy on account of the Divine Truth descending out of heaven.<p>So in Job:<p>"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_38_7.htm">38:7</a>).<p>This is said concerning the state of the church in its beginning, and by stars are signified the knowledges of truth and good, and by the sons of God, Divine truths; their joy, that is, the joy of men under their influence, is signified by their singing and shouting.</p><p>[8] Again, in David:<p>"Praise" God "with the sound of the trumpet" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_150_3.htm">Psalm 150:3</a>).<p>And again:<p>"Blessed are the people that know the sound of the trumpet; they shall walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy faces" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_15.htm">Psalm 89:15</a>).<p>The trumpet sound signifies Divine Truth gladdening the heart, it is therefore said, "light of thy faces," which signifies Divine Truth. That the sound of the horn and of the trumpet signifies Divine truths descending out of heaven, terrifying the evil and scattering them, as here in the Apocalypse by the trumpets with which the seven angels sounded, is evident from the following passages.<p>In Isaiah it is said,<p>"Jehovah shall go forth as a lion, <sup>1</sup>he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war; he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail over his enemies" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">42:13</a>).<p>Enemies are the evil.<p>So in Joel:<p>"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of Jehovah cometh, a day of darkness and of gloominess" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_2.htm">2</a>).<p>The day of Jehovah is the coming of the Lord, when a last judgment upon the evil also takes place.</p><p>[9] And in Zechariah:<p>"And Jehovah shall be seen over them, and his dart shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">9:14</a>).<p>Here also the coming of the Lord is treated of, when the evil shall perish. By blowing the trumpet and sounding an alarm, is signified to disperse by means of Divine Truth; the dart also which shall go forth as lightning, signifies truth dispersing and destroying. The same is signified by blowing the trumpet in Jeremiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_27.htm">51:27</a>), and in Hosea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_5_8.htm">5:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>).</p><p>[10] Since the evil, when they are gathered together in the spiritual world, are deprived of the truths and goods of which they made a pretence in externals by the influx of Divine Good and Divine Truth, and are let into their own evils and falsities which they inwardly cherished, and are thus separated from the good and cast down into the hells, and since there is heard from a distance, when this takes place, as it were trumpets and horns sounding as stated above several times, therefore it was a statute with the children of Israel, that they should sound with the trumpets for battle; as is also related concerning Phinehas, and concerning Gideon, when they fought against the Midianites, and also when Jericho was taken. Thus, in Moses, it is said of Phinehas, that Moses sent twelve thousand men armed, a thousand from each tribe, with the vessels of holiness and the trumpets in the hand of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, against Midian, and they slew every male, and their kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_1.htm">Num. 31:1-8</a>).</p><p>[11] Concerning Gideon it is said in the book of Judges, that he divided three hundred men into three companies, and placed a trumpet in the hand of each man, and empty pitchers, and torches within the pitchers; and he said,<p>"When I blow with the trumpet, I and all who are with me, blow ye also with the trumpets on every side around all the camp;" and when they sounded with the trumpets, Jehovah set every man's sword against his fellow, and against the whole camp, and the Midianites fled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_7_16.htm">7:16-22</a>).<p>And in Joshua, concerning the taking of Jericho it was commanded that seven priests should carry seven trumpets sounding them before the ark, and should go round the city six days, once on each day, and that on the seventh day they should go round the city seven times, and blow with the trumpets; and "when the people in Jericho heard the voice of the trumpet, and the shoutings of the people, the wall of the city fell down flat, and the people went up into the city, and took it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_6_1.htm">6:1-20</a>). These things represented the routing of the evil in the spiritual world, which is effected by means of the Divine Truth out of heaven, which, when it flows down, is heard there as a trumpet sounding, as said above. All the miracles related in the Word were representative and thence significative of things Divine in the heavens. Hence the effect of the sound of the trumpets upon enemies on earth was similar to the effect upon the evil in the spiritual world. For enemies, in the Word, represented and thence signify the evil; the Midianites, those who are in the falsities of evil; and the city of Jericho, in this passage, signifies the falsification of the knowledges of truth.</p><p>[12] From these considerations the signification of these words in Jeremiah is clear:<p>"Shout against" Babel "round about; she hath given her hand; her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">50:15</a>).<p>And in Zephaniah:<p>"A day of wasting and desolation, a day of darkness and thick darkness, a day of cloud and thick cloudiness, a day of the trumpet and alarm upon the fenced cities, and upon the high towers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">1:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_16.htm">16</a>).<p>From what has been stated the signification of the seven angels sounding the trumpets is now evident, and that such effects followed as are here described. Thus, to sound with trumpets, signifies the influx of the Divine Truth out of heaven, and the changes which follow. For the subjects treated of in this chapter and in the following chapters of the Apocalypse are the state of the church in the spiritual world before the judgment, the scattering of the evil, and the casting of them down into hell.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"As a lion." The Latin is "sicut Leo." This is the reading of the photolithograph MS., and also of the <a href="../ar/397.htm">A.R. 397</a>; but "heros" is the reading in A. 100[5323], <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8261.htm">8261</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8293.htm">8293</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8875.htm">8875</a>, and elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 502</h4><p>502. Verse 7 (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>). And the first angel sounded, signifies influx out of heaven, and in consequence the first change. This is evident from the signification of "sounding a trumpet," as being the influx of Divine truth out of heaven; and as the first change resulting therefrom is now described, this also is what is signified. "To sound a trumpet" signifies the influx of Divine truth out of heaven, because when Divine truth flows down out of heaven it is sometimes heard in the spiritual world as the sound of a horn or as the blast of a trumpet, and also to those who stand below there appear as it were angels having trumpets; but these are representations and appearances, such as exist below the heavens, for it is Divine truth descending or flowing down out of heaven towards the lower parts that is thus represented. This is why "to sound a trumpet" signifies the flowing down of Divine truth out of heaven.</p><p>[2] When this flowing down is strong it produces one effect with the good and another with the evil. With the good it illustrates the understanding, joins them more closely with heaven, and thence gladdens and vivifies their minds; but with the evil it disturbs the understanding, separates them from heaven, joins them more closely with hell, induces terror in their minds, and finally brings spiritual death. This makes clear that "sounding a trumpet" signifies, in its effect, the revelation and manifestation of Divine truth (See above, n. <a href="../ae/55.htm">55</a>, <a href="../ae/262.htm">262</a>); and in the contrary sense the deprivation of truth and desolation. Since it is here said that the angels sounded seven times, it is necessary to show from the Word what "to sound" signifies, and thence why it is said "the angel sounded."</p><p>[3] That "to sound trumpets" and "horns" signifies revelation and manifestation of Divine truth, is evident from the sound of a trumpet that was heard when Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai and promulgated the Law, which is thus described in Moses:<p>And it came to pass on the third day when it was becoming morning, that there were voices and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mount (Sinai), and the voice of a horn exceeding strong; and all the people that were in the camp trembled; when Jehovah descended upon it in fire. And the voice of the horn went on and became exceeding strong. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, testify to the people lest they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many of them fall (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16-25</a>).<p>The "Law" that was then promulgated signifies Divine truth; the "voice of a horn" represented its flowing down out of heaven and its manifestation; "the voice of the horn going on and becoming exceeding strong" represented the increase of this influx in approaching the lower parts, for it is said that "the people stood in the lower parts of the mount;" that "the people trembled exceedingly," and were admonished "not to approach nearer to the mountain lest they perish," signifies the effect of the flowing down of Divine truth with such as the sons of Jacob were. That interiorly they were utterly evil is evident from their worship of the calf after a month of days; moreover, if they had not stood afar off they would have perished, consequently they were in terror of death.</p><p>[4] "To sound horns" and "trumpets" represented and thus signified Divine truth coming down and flowing in out of heaven, as can be seen from the institution and use of trumpets among the sons of Israel. For it was commanded:<p>That trumpets should be made of silver, and that the sons of Aaron should sound them for convocations, for journeyings, on days of gladness, on feast days, in the beginnings of months, over sacrifices, for a memorial, and for battle (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1551.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5658.htm">5658</a>.) The "sons of Aaron sounded them," because Aaron himself as chief priest represented the Lord in relation to Divine good, and his sons the Lord in relation to Divine truth (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9806.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9806</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9807.htm">9807</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9966.htm">9966</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10017.htm">10017</a>). They were sounded for convocations and journeyings, because Divine truth is what calls together, gathers together, teaches the way, and leads. They were sounded on days of gladness, at feasts, in the beginnings of months, and over sacrifices, because Divine truth coming down out of heaven produces gladness and the holiness of worship. They were sounded for wars and for battle to signify that with the evil, who are the "enemies" in the Word, Divine truth flowing down out of heaven produces the terror of death, puts to flight, and disperses; in this sense, and because of this effect, it is here said that "the seven angels sounded" in their order.</p><p>[5] Because it was commanded that they should sound trumpets for convocations, it is said by the Lord in Malachi:<p>He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p>Here "angels with a great sound of a trumpet" signify the Divine truth that is to be revealed when the age is consummated, that is, when the church shall come to an end.</p><p>[6] In Isaiah:<p>In that day a great horn shall sound, and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt, and shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, at Jerusalem (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord's coming; a convocation to the church and salvation by the Lord are signified by "In that day a great horn shall sound, and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt;" "to sound a horn" signifies Divine truth calling together and saving; "those perishing in the land of Assyria" mean those who are deceived by false reasonings, and "the outcasts from the land of Egypt" those who are deceived by knowledges (scientifica), thus the Gentiles that were in falsities from ignorance of the truth; that these shall worship the Lord from love and in truth is signified by "they shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, at Jerusalem;" "mountain of holiness" signifying the church in respect to the good of love, consequently also the good of love of the church, and "Jerusalem" signifying the church in respect to the truth of doctrine, consequently the truth of doctrine of the church. From this it is evident that "to sound with a horn" signifies Divine truth coming down out of heaven.</p><p>[7] Because Divine truth coming down from the Lord through the heavens makes the hearts glad and infuses the holiness of worship, and therefore trumpets were sounded on days of gladness and at the feasts, therefore it is said in David:<p>Sing unto Jehovah with the harp; with the harp and the voice of a psalm, with trumpets and the sound of a horn sound before the King Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_98_5.htm">Psalms 98:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_98_6.htm">6</a>).<p>In Zephaniah:<p>Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout (sound), O Israel; be glad and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_3_14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>).<p>This is said of the establishment of the church by the Lord; "trumpets," "sound of the horn," and "sounding," signify joy on account of Divine truth coming down out of heaven. In Job:<p>When the morning stars sang, and all the sons of God shouted [sounded] (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_38_7.htm">Job 38:7</a>).<p>This is said of the state of the church in its beginning; and "stars" signify the knowledges of truth and good, and "the sons of God" Divine truths; the joy of these, that is, of men because of these, is signified by their "singing and sounding."</p><p>[8] In David:<p>Praise God with the sound of the horn (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_150_3.htm">Psalms 150:3</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Blessed is that people who know the trumpet sound; they shall walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_15.htm">Psalms 89:15</a>).<p>"The sound of the horn" signifies Divine truth making the heart glad, therefore it is also said, "in the light of Thy face," which signifies Divine truth. That "the voices of the horn" and "sounds of trumpets" signify Divine truth coming down out of heaven, and terrifying the evil and dispersing them, as here in Revelation "the trumpets" with which the seven angels sounded, is evident in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah shall go forth as a hero, <sup>1</sup>He shall stir up zeal like a man of war, He shall shout [sound] and shall cry out, He shall prevail over His enemies (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>);<p>"enemies" meaning the evil. In Joel:<p>Blow ye with the horn in Zion, and sound in the mountain of My holiness; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of Jehovah cometh, a day of darkness and of thick darkness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_2.htm">2</a>).<p>"The day of Jehovah" is the coming of the Lord, when also the Last Judgment takes place on the evil.</p><p>[9] In Zechariah:<p>Jehovah shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall blow the horn, and shall go with the tempests of the south (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>).<p>This, too, refers to the Lord's coming, when the evil are to perish; "to blow the horn" signifies to disperse by means of Divine truth; "the arrow shall go forth as lightning" signifies truth dispersing and destroying. "To blow the horn" has the same signification in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_5_8.htm">Hosea 5:8-9</a>.</p><p>[10] Because the evil, where they are gathered together in the spiritual world, are deprived by the influx of Divine good and Divine truth of the truths and goods they have simulated in externals, and are let into their evils and falsities which they have inwardly cherished, and are thus separated from the good and cast down into the hells, and because when this takes place there are heard by those at a distance as it were horns and trumpets sounding, as has been said above repeatedly, so with the horns of Israel it was on this account commanded that they should sound with the trumpets for battle; and we read that this was done by Phinehas and by Gideon, in their combats against the Midianites and also at the taking of Jericho. It is said of Phinehas in Moses:<p>That Moses sent twelve thousand men armed, a thousand from each tribe, with the vessels of holiness and the trumpets, in the hand of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, against Midian; and they slew all the males and their kings (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_31_1.htm">Numbers 31:1-8</a>).</p><p>[11] Of Gideon it is said in the book of Judges:<p>That he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put a horn in the hand of everyone, and empty pitchers and torches in the midst of the pitchers; and he said, When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, blow ye also the horn about the whole camp. And when they blew the horns Jehovah set the sword of a man against his companion and against the whole camp, and the Midianites fled (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_7_16.htm">Judges 7:16-22</a>).<p>And of Jericho when it was taken, in Joshua:<p>It was commanded that seven priests should bear seven jubilee horns before the ark, and should go round the city six days, once each day, and on the seventh day they should go round the city seven times, and blow the horns; and when the people in Jericho heard the voice of the horn and the shoutings of the people, the wall of the city fell down under itself, and the people went up into the city and took it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_6_1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>).<p>These things represented the overcoming of the evil in the spiritual world, which is effected by Divine truth out of heaven, which is heard there when it flows down as a horn sounding, as was said above. All the miracles related in the Word were representative and thence significative of things Divine in the heavens; therefore the effect of the sound of horns against enemies on earth was like the effect against the evil in the spiritual world; for in the Word "enemies" represented and thence signified the evil, "the Midianites" those who are in the falsities of evil, and the city "Jericho" here the falsification of the knowledges of truth.</p><p>[12] From this the signification can be seen of the following in Jeremiah:<p>Sound against Babylon round about; she hath given her hand; her foundations are fallen, her walls are torn down (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>).<p>And in Zephaniah:<p>A day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and of gloominess, a day of the horn and of sounding upon the fenced cities, and upon the high corners (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_16.htm">16</a>).<p>From this it can now be seen what is signified by "the seven angels sounded the trumpets," and that such effects result therefrom as are here described; and thus that "to sound trumpets" signifies influx of Divine truth out of heaven, and the changes thence arising; for this and the following chapters of Revelation treat of the state of the church in the spiritual world before the judgment, and of the dispersion and casting into hell of the evil.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "lion," the Hebrew "hero;" so also <a href="../ae/734.htm">AE 734</a>;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1664.htm">AC 1664</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5323.htm">5323</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8273.htm">8273</a>, etc. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 502 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>502. [Vers 7.] "Et primus angelus clanxit." - Quod significet influxum e caelo, et inde primam mutationem, constat ex significatione "clangere tuba", quod sit influxus Divini Veri e caelo; et quia prima mutatio inde existens nunc describitur, etiam haec significatur. <p>Quod "clangere tuba" significet influxum Divini Veri e caelo, est quia dum e caelo defluit Divinum Verum, in mundo spirituali quandoque auditur ut sonus buccinae et ut clangor tubae, et quoque ab illis qui infra stant conspiciuntur sicut angeli habentes tubas; sed haec sunt repraesentationes et apparentiae, quales existunt infra caelos, est enim Divinum Verum descendens seu defluens e caelo versus inferiora quod sic repraesentatur; inde nunc est quod "clangere tuba" significet defluxum Divini Veri ex caelo.<p>[2] Ille defluxus, quando fortis est, alium effectum edit apud bonos et alium apud malos; apud bonos illustrat intellectum, conjungit illos arctius caelo, et inde animos laetificat et vivificat; apud malos autem perturbat intellectum, separat a caelo, conjungit arctius inferno, ac animis inducit terrorem, ac tandem infert mortem spiritualem. Exinde patet quod per "clangere tuba" quoad effectum significetur revelatio et manifestatio Divini Veri (ut supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_55" target=_top>55</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_262" target=_top>262</a>); et in opposito sensu deprivatio veri et desolatio. Quoniam nunc memoratur quod angeli septies clanxerint, necessum est ut ex Verbo ostendatur quid "clangere" significat, et inde cur dicitur quod "angelus clanxerit."<p>[3] Quod "clangere tubis" et "buccinis" significet revelationem Divini Veri et manifestationem ejus, constat ex sono buccinae audito cum Jehovah descendit super Montem Sinai et promulgavit Legem; de qua re ita apud Mosen,<p>"Fuit in die tertio, in fieri mane, et fuit, voces et fulgura et nubes gravis super Monte" Sinai, "et vox buccinae vehemens valde, et trepidabat omnis populus qui in castris, .... cum descendit Jehovah super illum in igne, .... et fuit vox buccinae vadens et fortificans se valde:.... et dixit Jehovah ad Mosen, Descende, obtestare populum, ne forte perrumpant ad Jehovam ad videndum, et cadat de eo multus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_19_16-25" target=_top>Exodus 19:16-25</a>):<p>per "Legem", quae tunc promulgabatur, significatur Divinum Verum; per "vocem buccinae " repraesentabatur ejus defluxus e caelo et manifestatio; per quod "vox buccinae vaderet et se fortificaret valde" repraesentabatur ejus increscentia versus inferiora, nam dicitur quod "populus steterit in inferioribus montis"; quod "populus trepidaret valde", et admoneretur "ut non propius ad montem accederent, ne perirent", significabat effectum Divini Veri defluentis apud tales quales filii Jacobi erant. Quod prorsus interius mali, constare potest ex cultu vituli post mensem dierum, et periissent si non e longinquo stetissent; inde illis terror mortis.<p>[4] Quod "clangere buccinis" et "tubis" repraesentaverit et inde significaverit Divinum Verum e caelo descendens et influens, constare potest ex institutione et usu tubarum apud filios Israelis; statutum enim erat<p>Ut tubae ex argento conficerentur, et quod filii Aharonis illis clangerent ad convocationes, ad profectiones in diebus laetitiae, in festis, in principiis mensium, super sacrificiis, in memoriale, et ad bellum ( <sup>1</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_10_1-10" target=_top>Num. 10:1-10</a>):<p>quod ex argento" conficerentur, erat quia "argentum significat verum ex bono, ita Divinum Verum; (quod argentum id significet, videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_1551" target=_top>1551</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_1552" target=_top>1552</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2954" target=_top>2954</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5658" target=_top>5658</a>); quod "filii Aharonis illis clangerent", erat causa, quia ipse Aharon ut Summus Sacerdos repraesentabat Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum, et filii ejus Dominum quoad Divinum Verum (videatur etiam in Arcanis Caelestibus n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9806" target=_top>9806</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9807" target=_top>9807</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9966" target=_top>9966</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10017" target=_top>10017</a>). <p>Quod "ad convocationes et profectiones", erat quia Divinum Verum convocat, congregat, vias docet et ducit: quod "clangerent in diebus laetitiae, in festis, in principiis mensium, et super sacrificiis", erat quia Divinum Verum descendens e caelo laetificat et facit sanctum cultus; quod "clangerent etiam ad bella et ad proelia" significabat quod Divinum Verum defluens e caelo apud malos, qui in Verbo sunt "hostes", incutiat terrorem mortis, profuget et dissipet; in quo sensu, et ob quem effectum, hic dicitur quod "septem angeli suo ordine clanxerint."<p>[5] Quoniam statutum fuit ut tubis clangerent ad convocationes, ideo a Domino dicitur apud Matthaeum,<p>Quod "mittet angelos suos cum tubae voce magna, et congregabunt electos Ipsius a quatuor ventis, a terminis caelorum usque ad terminos eorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_31" target=_top>24:31</a>);<p>et ibi per "angelos cum tubae voce magna" significatur Divinum Verum quod revelandum quando consummatum est saeculum, hoc est, quando finis ecclesiae venturus est.<p>[6] Et apud Esaiam,<p>"In die illo clangetur buccina magna, et venient pereuntes in terra Aschuris, et expulsi e terra Aegypti, et incurvabunt se Jehovae in monte sanctitatis, in Hierosolyma" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_27_13" target=_top>27:13</a>):<p>haec dicta sunt de adventu Domini; convocatio ad ecclesiam et salvatio a Domino significatur per quod "in die illo clangetur buccina magna", et quod "venient pereuntes in terra Aschuris, et expulsi e terra Aegypti"; "clangere buccina" significat Divinum Verum convocans et salvans; "pereuntes in terra Aschuris" sunt qui decepti per ratiocinia falsa, et "expulsi e terra Aegypti" sunt qui per scientifica, ita gentes quae in falsis ex ignorantia veri fuerunt: quod illi adoraturi Dominum ex amore et in veritate, significatur per quod "incurvabunt se Jehovae in monte sanctitatis, in Hierosolyma"; per "montem sanctitatis" significatur ecclesia quoad bonum amoris, proinde etiam bonum amoris ecclesiae, et per "Hierosolymam" significatur ecclesia quoad verum doctrinae, proinde verum doctrinae ecclesiae: ex his etiam patet quod per "clangere buccina" significetur Divinum Verum e caelo descendens.<p>[7] Quoniam Divinum Verum descendens a Domino per caelos laetificat corda, ac infundit sanctum cultus, ac ideo in diebus laetitiae et in festis clangebatur tubis, quare dicitur apud Davidem,<p>"Cantate Jehovae cithara, cithara et voce cantus, tubis et voce buccinae, clangite coram Rege Jehovah" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_98_5" target=_top>Psalms 98:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_98_6" target=_top>6</a>);<p>apud Zephaniam,<p>"Canta, filia Zionis; clange, Israel; laetare et exulta ex omni corde, filia Hierosolymae" ( <sup>2</sup></p><p>Zephaniam 31:4; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_38_7" target=_top>Hiobum 38:7</a>);<p>haec dicta sunt de statu ecclesiae in principio, ac per "stellas" significantur cognitiones veri et boni, et per "filios Dei" Divina vera; gaudium illorum, hoc est, hominum ex illis, significatur per quod "canant" et "clangant."<p>[8] Apud Davidem,<p>"Laudate" Deum "cum clangore buccinae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_150_3" target=_top>Psalms 150:3</a>):<p>et apud eundem,<p>"Beatus populus eorum qui clangorem norunt, Jehovah, in luce facierum tuarum ambulabunt" (Psalms 89:16 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_89_15" target=_top>15</a>]):<p>per "clangorem buccinae" significatur Divinum Verum laetificans cor; quare etiam dicitur, "lux facierum tuarum", per quam significatur Divinum Verum. <p>Quod "voces buccinae" et "clangores tubarum" significent Divina vera descendentia e caelo, et terrificantia malos et dissipantia illos, ut hic in Apocalypsi per "tubas" quibus septem angeli clanxerunt, constat apud Esaiam,<p>"Jehovah sicut <sup>3</sup></p><p>Leo exibit, sicut vir bellorum excitabit zelum, clanget, etiamque clamabit, super hostes suos invalescet" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_42_13" target=_top>42:13</a>);<p>"hostes" sunt mali.<p>Apud Joelem,<p>"Clangite buccina in Zione, et clangite in monte sanctitatis meae, cohorrescant omnes habitatores terrae, quia venit dies Jehovae dies tenebrarum et caliginis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_2_1" target=_top>2:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_2_2" target=_top>2</a>);<p>"dies Jehovae" est adventus Domini, quando etiam ultimum judicium super malos.<p>[9] Apud Sachariam,<p>"Jehovah super iis apparebit, et exibit sicut fulgur telum Ejus, et Dominus Jehovih buccina clanget, et incedet in procellis meridiei" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_9_14" target=_top>9:14</a>);<p>etiam haec de adventu Domini, quando mali perituri; per "clangere buccina" significatur per Divinum Verum dispergere; etiam per "telum" quod "sicut fulgur exibit" significatur verum dispergens et destruens.<p>Simile significatur per "clangere buccina" apud Jeremiam (cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_27" target=_top>51:27</a>), et apud Hoscheam (cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_5_8" target=_top>5:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_5_9" target=_top>9</a>).</p><p>[10] Quoniam mali, ubi simul congregati sunt in mundo spirituali, per influxum Divini Boni ac Divini Veri, deprivantur veris et bonis quae simulaverunt in externis, ac immittuntur in sua mala et falsa quae intus foverunt, et sic separantur a bonis ac dejiciuntur in inferna, et quia, cum hoc fit, auditur a distantibus sicut buccinae et tubae clangentes, ut supra aliquoties dictum est, ideo apud filios Israelis statutum fuit ut clangerent tubis ad proelia; quod etiam factum legitur a Pinchaso, tum a Guideone, pugnantibus contra Midianitas, et quoque quando Jericho capta est. De Pinchaso legitur apud Mosen,<p>Quod miserit Moseh duodecim millia armatos, mille e tribu, cum vasis sanctitatis et tubis in manu Pinchasi filii Eleasaris sacerdotis, contra Midianem; et occiderunt omnem masculum et reges eorum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_31_1-8" target=_top>Numeri 31:1-8</a>).</p><p>[11] De Guideone, in Libro Judicum,<p>Quod Guideon diviserit trecentos viros in tria agmina, et dederit buccinam in manum cujusque, et hydrias vacuas et faces in medio hydriarum; et dixerit, .... Cum clanxero buccina, ego et omnes qui mecum, clangetis buccinis etiam vos circum universa castra;.... et cum clanxerunt buccinis, posuit Jehovah gladium viri contra socium ejus, et contra universa castra, et fugerunt Midianitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_7_16-22" target=_top>7:16-22</a>).<p>Et de Jericho, quando capta est, apud Josuam,<p>Mandatum quod septem sacerdotes portarent septem buccinas jubilantes coram arca, et circumirent urbem sex diebus, una vice quovis die, at die septimo circumirent urbem septem vicibus, et clangerent buccinis:.... "et cum audivit populus in Jericho vocem buccinae, et vociferationes populi, cecidit murus urbis sub se, et ascendit populus in urbem, et cepit illam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_6_1-20" target=_top>6:1-20</a>)'<p>per haec repraesentata est profligatio malorum in mundo spirituali, quae fit per Divinum Verum e caelo, quod cum defluit, auditur ibi sicut buccina clangens, ut supra dictum est. Omnia miracula memorata in Verbo repraesentativa sunt et inde significativa Divinorum in caelis: inde effectus clangoris buccinarum contra hostes in terra similis fuit effectui contra malos in mundo spirituali; per "hostes" enim in Verbo repraesentabantur et inde significantur mali, per "Midianitas" qui in falsis multi, et per "Jericho" urbem ibi falsificatio cognitionum veri.</p><p>[12] Ex his constare potest quid significatur per haec apud Jeremiam,<p>"Clangite contra" Babelem "circum circa, dedit manum suam, ceciderunt fundamenta ejus, destructi sunt muri ejus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_15" target=_top>50:15</a> <sup>4</sup></p><p>):<p>et apud Zephaniam,<p>"Dies Vastationis et devastationis, dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nubis et obnubilationis, dies buccinae et clangoris super urbes munitas, et super angulos altos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_1_15" target=_top>1:15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_1_16" target=_top>16</a>).<p>Ex his nunc constare potest quid significatur per quod "septem angeli clanxerint tubis", et quod tales effectus, quales describuntur, inde resultaverint; et sic quod "clangere tubis" significet influxum Divini Veri e caelo, ac mutationes inde oriundas; agitur enim in hoc capite Apocalypseos, et in sequentibus, de statu ecclesiae in mundo spirituali ante judicium, ac de malorum dissipatione et conjectione in infernum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>2.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>3.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here.<br>4.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
