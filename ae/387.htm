<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 387</h4><p>387. And with death. That this signifies the consequent extinction of spiritual life, is plain from the signification of death, as denoting the extinction of spiritual life (concerning which see above, n. <a href="../ae/78.htm">78</a>, <a href="../ae/186.htm">186</a>). That this is here signified by death is plain from the series of things in the internal sense; for it is said that power was given unto them to kill with the sword, with famine, and with death: and by the sword is signified falsity destroying truth; by famine, the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good; whence by death is signified the extinction of spiritual life, for where falsity reigns, and where there are no knowledges of truth and good, there is no spiritual life; for it is acquired by the knowledges of truth and good applied to the uses of life. For man is born into all evil and the falsity thence, therefore he is also born entirely ignorant of all spiritual knowledges; in order, therefore, that he may be led from the evils and the falsities thence, into which he is born, and be led into the life of heaven, and be saved, it is necessary that he should learn the knowledges of truth and good, by which he can be introduced [into spiritual life] and become spiritual. From this series of things in the internal sense it is evident, that by death is here signified the extinction of spiritual life; this also is signified by spiritual death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 387</h4><p>387. And with death, signifies the consequent extinction of spiritual life. This is evident from the signification of "death," as being the extinction of spiritual life (See above, n. <a href="../ae/78.htm">78</a>, <a href="../ae/186.htm">186</a>). That this is what "death" here signifies is evident from the series of things in the internal sense; for it is said that "there was given unto them power to kill with sword, with famine, and with death;" and "sword" signifies falsity destroying truth, "famine" the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good; thence "death" signifies the extinction of spiritual life; for where falsity reigns, and where there are no knowledges of truth and good, there is no spiritual life, for spiritual life is acquired by means of the knowledges of truth and good applied to the uses of life. For man is born into all evil and falsity from evil; he is therefore born also into an entire ignorance of all spiritual knowledges; therefore in order that he may be led away from the evils and consequent falsities into which he is born, and be led into the life of heaven and be saved, he must needs acquire the knowledges of truth and good, by means of which he can be led into spiritual life and become spiritual. From this series of things in the internal sense it is evident that "death" here signifies the extinction of spiritual life; this is meant, too, by spiritual death. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 387 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>387. "Et in morte." - Quod significet inde exstinctionem vitae spiritualis, constat ex significatione "mortis", quod sit exstinctio vitae spiritualis (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_387/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_78" target=_top>78</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_387/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_186" target=_top>186</a>): quod hoc per "mortem" hic significetur, constat ex serie rerum in sensu interno; dicitur enim quod "data illis sit potestas interficiendi gladio, fame et morte", et per "gladium" significatur falsum destruens verum, per "famem" deprivatio cognitionum veri et boni, inde per "mortem" significatur exstinctio vitae spiritualis; nam ubi falsum regnat, ac ubi nullae cognitiones veri et boni sunt, ibi non est aliqua vita spiritualis, haec enim comparatur per cognitiones veri et boni applicatas usibus vitae: homo enim nascitur in omne malum et inde falsum, quare etiam nascitur in plenariam ignorantiam omnium cognitionum spiritualium; ut ergo abducatur a malis et inde falsis in quae nascitur, et ducatur in vitam caeli ac salvetur, necessum est ut discat cognitiones veri et boni, per quas introducatur, et fiat spiritualis. Ex hac serie rerum in sensu interno patet quod per "mortem" hic significetur exstinctio vitae spiritualis: hoc quoque significatur per mortem spiritualem. </p>
