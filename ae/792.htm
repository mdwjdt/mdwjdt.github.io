<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 792</h4><p>792. Who is able to make war with him? That this signifies that it cannot be assaulted by any means is evident without explanation. For when by the dragon and his beast is signified the heretical dogma concerning faith alone; by not being able to fight with the beast is signified that it cannot be assaulted. That the persuasion of those who believe that dogma is so strong that they believe nothing can be truer, is clear from its reception in the Christian churches. For they say, "Who is able to do good of himself?" and so they leave it out. But what man is there who at the first sight, or, as it is said, at the first glance of the eye, cannot see that man's quality is according to his life? Who can doubt or deny this, especially when every one is confirmed therein from the Word, where it is said, that he is a wise man who hears and does, and that all shall be judged according to their works? I do not see how any one, who has not a twist in his intellectual faculty, and thence talks wildly, can possibly think that to live well is of no account; when, nevertheless, a man remains after death such as his life was in the world. It has been granted me to speak with some who lived in former ages, and it was found that their life was similar to that which is written about them in history. It has also been granted me to speak with some who believed that they had faith, but who had not lived the life of faith, which is charity; and it was discovered that they were shut out from heaven. And, moreover, it has been often told me from heaven, that the life of man remains, and that faith separate from life is nothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 792</h4><p>792. Who is able to make war with him? signifies that it can in no wise be impugned. This is evident without explanation; for when "the dragon" and its "beast" signify the heretical dogma of faith alone, "not to be able to make war with the beast" signifies that it cannot be impugned. That their persuasion is so strong that they believe that nothing is more true is clearly evident from the reception of this dogma in Christian churches. For they say, Who is able to do good of himself? and thus they omit it. But what man at the first look, or as it is said, at the first glance of the eye, cannot see that a man is such as his life is? Who can call this into doubt, or turn it into a negative, especially when everyone may be confirmed in it by the Word, where it is said that "he is a wise man who hears and does," and that "all shall be judged according to their deeds." I do not see how anyone who has not twisted his understanding backwards, and has thus become crazy, can think that to live well is of no account; when nevertheless man continues after death such as his life has been in the world. It has been granted me to speak with some who lived ages ago, and it was found that their life was still such as it is described in history with respect to them. It has also been granted me to speak with some who believed that they had faith but had not lived the life of faith, which is charity; and it was found that they had been shut out from heaven. Moreover, it has often been declared out of heaven that his life awaits the man, and that faith separated from life is nothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 792 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>792. "Quis potest pugnare cum illa?" Quod significet quod nullatenus impugnari possit, constat absque explicatione, nam cum per "draconem" et ejus "bestiam" significatur dogma haereticum de sola fide, per "non posse pugnare cum bestia" significatur quod illud non impugnari possit: quod illis tam fortis persuasio sit ut credant sicut quod nihil verius, patet manifeste ex ejus receptione in Christianis Ecclesiis; dicunt enim, Quis potest bonum facere a se ipso? et sic omittunt. Quis hominum non ex primo intuitu, seu, ut dicitur, ex primo jactu oculi, videre potest quod homo sit qualis ejus vita sit? Quis id potest in dubium vocare, et in negativum vertere? et eo minus, cum quisque in eo confirmatur ex Verbo, ubi dicitur quod "sapiens sit qui audit et facit", et quod "omnes secundum facta judicabuntur." Non video an alius quam qui intellectuale suum retro torsit, et inde delirat, potest cogitare quod bene vivere nihil faciat; cum tamen homo manet post mortem qualis ejus vita fuerat in mundo. Datum est loqui cum aliquibus qui ante saecula vixerunt, et deprehensi quod eis similis vita esset qualis descripta est in historicis de illis: et datum est loqui cum aliquibus qui crediderunt se fidem habuisse, sed non vixerunt vitam fidei, quae est charitas, et deprehensum quod exclusi essent caelo: et praeterea saepe e caelo dictum est quod vita maneat hominem, et quod fides separata a vita nihil sit. </p>
