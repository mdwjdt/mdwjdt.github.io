<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 751</h4><p>751. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.- That this signifies the salvation and consequent joy of those who become spiritual by the reception of Divine Truth, is evident from the signification of rejoicing, as denoting joy on account of salvation; from the signification of the heavens, as denoting those who are spiritual (concerning which we shall speak presently); and from the signification of ye that dwell, as denoting those who live, here spiritually. That to dwell signifies to live, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/133.htm">133</a>, <a href="../ae/479.htm">479</a>, <a href="../ae/662.htm">662</a>). The heavens signify those who are spiritual, because all who are in the heavens are spiritual, and because men who have become spiritual are also in the heavens, although they are in the world as to the body; therefore ye that dwell in the heavens means not only angels, but also men, for every man with whom the interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind, has been opened, is in the heavens, indeed, he also sometimes appears amongst the angels there. That this is so, has not been known in the world up to the present time. It must therefore be understood, that man as to his spirit is among spirits and angels, and indeed in that society of them into which he is to come after death. The reason of this is that the spiritual mind of man is formed exactly according to the image of heaven, and in such a way that it is a heaven in least form; consequently that mind, although still in the body, must nevertheless be where its form is. But this has been more fully dealt with in <a href="../hh/51.htm">Heaven and Hell 51-58</a>), where it is shown that every angel, and also every man as to his interiors, if he be spiritual, is a heaven in its least form, corresponding to heaven in its greatest form. For this reason where the Word treats of the creation of heaven and earth, the internal and external church is in general meant, and, in particular, the internal and external man, that is the spiritual and natural man. From these things it is evident that the heavens and those that dwell in them signify all who are there, and also those men who are becoming spiritual by the reception of Divine Truth in doctrine and life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 751</h4><p>751. Verse 12. For this rejoice, ye heavens and ye that dwell in them, signifies the salvation and consequent joy of those who become spiritual by the reception of Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of "rejoicing," as being joy on account of salvation; also from the signification of "heavens," as being those who are spiritual (of which presently); also from the signification of "ye that dwell," as being those who live, here spiritually. (That "to dwell" signifies to live, see above, n. <a href="../ae/133.htm">133</a>, <a href="../ae/479.htm">479</a>, <a href="../ae/662.htm">662</a>.) "The heavens" signify those who are spiritual, because all who are in the heavens are spiritual; and because men who have become spiritual are likewise in the heavens, although in respect to the body they are in the world, so "ye that dwell in the heavens" means not only angels, but also men. For every man with whom the interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind, has been opened, is in the heavens, yea, sometimes he even appears among the angels in the heavens. That this is so has not been known heretofore in the world; let it be known, therefore, that man in respect to his spirit is among spirits and angels, and even in that society of them into which he is to come after death. This is because the spiritual mind of man is formed wholly to the image of heaven, even so that it is a heaven in least form; consequently that mind, although it is still in the body, must nevertheless be where its form is. But this has been more fully illustrated in the work on <a href="../hh/51.htm">Heaven and Hell 51-58</a>, where it is shown that every angel and also every man, in respect to his interiors, if he be spiritual is a heaven in least form, corresponding to heaven in its greatest form. For this reason, where the Word treats of the creation of heaven and earth the church internal and external is meant in general, as also in particular the internal and external man, or the spiritual and natural man. From this it can be seen that "the heavens and those that dwell in them" signify all who are there, also men who are becoming spiritual by the reception of Divine truth in doctrine and life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 751 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>751. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_751/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_12" target=_top>12</a>.] "Propter hoc gaudete, caeli et in illis habitantes." - Quod significet salvationem et inde gaudium illorum qui spiritualis per receptionem Divini Veri fiunt, constat ex significatione "gaudere", quod sit gaudium propter salvationem; ex significatione "caelorum", quod sint spirituales (de qua sequitur), et ex significatione "habitantium", quod sint qui vivunt, hic spiritualiter. <p>(Quod "habitare" significet vivere, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_751/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_133" target=_top>133</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_751/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_479" target=_top>479</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_751/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_662" target=_top>662</a>.) Quod "caeli" significent spirituales, est quia omnes illi qui in caelis sunt spirituales sunt; et quia homines, qui facti sunt spirituales, similiter in caelis sunt, tametsi quoad corpus in mundo, ideo per "habitantes in caelis" non solum angeli, sed etiam homines intelliguntur: omnis enim homo apud quem mens interior, quae vocatur mens spiritualis, aperta est, in caelis est, immo etiam quandoque inter angelos in caelis apparet: quod ita sit, in mundo adhuc ignotum est; quare sciendum est quod homo quoad spiritum suum inter spiritus et angelos sit, et quidem in ea societate illorum in quam venturus est post mortem: causa est, quia mens spiritualis hominis prorsus formata est ad imaginem caeli, usque adeo ut sit caelum in minima forma; quare non alibi est quam ubi est forma ejus, et hoc tametsi illa mens adhuc in corpore est. Sed haec melius illustrata sunt in opere De Caelo et Inferno (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_751/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_51" target=_top>51-58</a>), ubi ostensum est quod unusquisque angelus, et quoque unusquisque homo quoad interiora sua, si hic spiritualis est, sit caelum in minima forma, correspondens caelo in maxima. Inde est quod in Verbo ubi agitur de creatione caeli et terrae, intelligatur in communi ecclesia interna et externa, tum in particulari homo internus et externus, seu spiritualis et naturalis. Ex his constare potest quod per "caelos et in illis habitantes" significentur omnes ibi, tum homines qui spirituales per Divini Veri receptionem doctrina et vita fiunt. </p>
