<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 357</h4><p>357. That a bow signifies doctrine fighting, or doctrine from which evils and falsities are fought against, and that arrows, javelins, and darts signify the truths of doctrine which fight, is evident from the following passages. In Zechariah:<p>"I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off. On the contrary, he shall speak peace to the nations. Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope, and I will bend Judah to me, and with the bow I will fill Ephraim, and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, for Jehovah shall appear over them, and his dart shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall blow with the trumpet, and he shall go in the whirlwinds of the south" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_10.htm">9:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_12.htm">12-14</a>).<p>The vastation of the Jewish church is here treated of, and the establishment of the church among the gentiles. The vastation of the Jewish church is described by, I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off; by which is signified that truth in doctrine would be no more, nor the understanding of truth, and thence no combat or resistance against falsity. By the chariot is signified the doctrine of truth; by the horse, the understanding thereof; by the bow of war, combat from doctrine against falsity. It is said the bow of war, because doctrine fighting is meant. By Ephraim is signified the church as to the understanding of truth, and by Jerusalem [the same] as to doctrine. And the establishment of the church among the nations, is described by these words, "On the contrary, he shall speak peace to the nations. Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; and I will bend Judah to me, and with the bow I will fill Ephraim, and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion." By which is signified, that the church shall be established among those who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in truths thence. By peace is signified that good; by Judah those who are in that good; and by Ephraim those who are in the understanding of truth thence; therefore it is said concerning Ephraim, "with the bow he will fill him," that is, with the doctrine of truth. Their enlightenment in truths is described by these words, "His dart shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall blow with the trumpet, and he shall go in the whirlwinds of the south." The dart which shall go forth as lightning, signifies truth enlightened, thus truth from the good of love; He shall blow with the trumpet signifies the plain perception of good; and the whirlwinds of the south signify the plain understanding of truth, the south denoting the light of truth; the subject here treated of is the Lord, thus that those things are from the Lord.</p><p>[2] In Moses:<p>"The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one near a fountain; the daughters, as he walketh upon the wall, shall embitter him, and shall shoot at him, the archers shall hate him; and he shall sit in the firmness of his bow, and the arms of his hands shall be strengthened by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; thence is he the shepherd, the stone of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6417.htm">6417</a>; and what [he signifies] besides, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4592.htm">4592</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4963.htm">4963</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5086.htm">5086</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5087.htm">5087</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5106.htm">5106</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5249.htm">5249</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5307.htm">5307</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5877.htm">5877</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6224.htm">6224</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6526.htm">6526</a>).</p><p>[3] In the second book of Samuel:<p>"David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan his son; and wrote, For teaching the sons of Judah the bow" (<a href="../ae/31.htm">31</a>); and by Jonathan, as the son of a king, is signified the truth of doctrine; therefore he wrote the lamentation, For teaching the sons of Judah the bow, by which is signified to teach them the doctrine of truth which is from good. The fighting of that truth against falsities and evils is described in that lamentation by these words:<p>"Without the blood of the slain, without the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty" (verse 22).<p>The blood of the slain signifies falsities conquered and dispersed; similarly the fat of the mighty signifies evils. That these are conquered and dispersed by the doctrine of truth which is from good, is signified by, "The bow of Jonathan returned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty," the bow of Jonathan denoting doctrine, and the sword of Saul denoting truth from good.</p><p>[4] In David:<p>"God teacheth my hands war, and placeth a bow of brass in mine arms" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>).<p>By war here is signified war in the spiritual sense, which is that against evils and falsities; this war God teaches; and by the bow of brass is signified the doctrine of charity, God places this in the arms, that is, that it may prevail.</p><p>[5] In Isaiah:<p>"Who raised up one from the east, whom in justice he called to his train, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? He gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_2.htm">41:2</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the Lord, and concerning His dominion over evils and falsities. By the nations which He gave before him are signified evils; and by the kings over whom he made Him to rule, are signified falsities. That he disperses the latter and the former as nothing by means of His Divine truth, and the doctrine thence, is signified by, "He gave them as dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow," his sword denoting Divine truth, and his bow denoting doctrine. That evils and falsities are dispersed as nothing, is signified by, "As the dust, and as driven stubble"; it is said that evils and falsities are so dispersed, and it is meant that those who are in evils and thence in falsities are so [dealt with] in the other life.</p><p>[6] In Zechariah:<p>"Jehovah shall visit his flock, the house of Judah, and shall place them as the horse of his glory in the battle. Out of him [shall come forth] the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the bow of war" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">10:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_4.htm">4</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the article immediately preceding, where the signification of the horse is treated of"; by the bow of war is signified the truth fighting from doctrine.</p><p>[7] In Habakkuk:<p>"Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou ridest upon thy horses, thy chariots salvation? With bareness shall thy bow be made bare" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_9.htm">9</a>).<p>This was also explained in the preceding article; by, "Thy bow shall be made bare," is signified that the doctrine of truth shall be opened.</p><p>[8] In Isaiah:<p>"Before the swords shall they wander, before the drawn sword, and before the bended bow; and for the grievousness of the war all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed, and the remains of the number of the bow of the strong sons of Kedar shall be few" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_21_15.htm">21:15-17</a>).<p>The subject here treated of, in the spiritual sense, is that the knowledges of good would perish, and that few would remain; by Kedar or Arabia are signified those who are in the knowledges of good, and abstractedly those knowledges themselves. That the knowledges of truth would perish by falsities and by the doctrine of falsity, is signified by, "Before the swords shall they wander, before the drawn sword, and before the bended bow." The sword denotes falsity combating and destroying, and the bow denotes the doctrine of falsity. That the knowledges of good would perish, is signified by these words, "for the grievousness of the war all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed," the grievousness of war denoting the state of assault, and all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed, denoting vastation. And that few knowledges of good would remain, is described by the remains of the number of the bow of the strong sons of Kedar shall be few. The bow of the mighty, denoting the doctrine of truth from the knowledges which prevail against falsities.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>"He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; he hath made me a polished dart; in his quiver hath he hid me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">49:2</a>).<p>The Lord is treated of here also; and by the sharp sword is signified truth dispersing falsity; by the polished dart truth dispersing evil; and by the quiver the Word. Hence it is manifest what is signified by, "He hath made my mouth as a sharp sword, and he hath made me a polished dart, and in his quiver hath he hid me," namely, that in Him and from Him is Divine truth, by which falsities and evils are dispersed, and that in Him and from Him is the Word, where and whence those truths are.</p><p>[10] In David:<p>"Lo, sons are the heritage of Jehovah; the fruit of the womb is his reward. As darts in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. Blessed is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with the enemies in the gate" (<a href="../hh/428.htm">Heaven and Hell 428</a>, <a href="../hh/429.htm">429</a>, <a href="../hh/583.htm">583</a>, <a href="../hh/584.htm">584</a>, 685).</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>"The sons of Ephraim, who were armed, shooters of the bow, turned back in the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_9.htm">Psalms 78:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_10.htm">10</a>).<p>By Ephraim here, as above, is signified the understanding of truth, and by his sons the truths themselves; therefore they are also called shooters of the bow, that is, combatants against evils and falsities. That in this case they did not resist these, because they were not conjoined with the Lord, is signified by, "they turned back in the day of battle, because they did not keep the covenant of God." Covenant denotes conjunction, and not to keep it, is not to live according to the truths and goods that conjoin. From the passages adduced it is evident, that by a bow is signified the doctrine of truth fighting against falsities and evils, and dispersing them.</p><p>[12] That this is signified by bow is still further evident from the opposite sense of it, in which bow signifies the doctrine of falsity fighting against truths and goods, and destroying them; and by darts and arrows the falsities themselves. The bow is mentioned in this sense in the following passages: In David:<p>"Lo, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the stringy, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2</a>).<p>The wicked bending the bow, signifies that they frame doctrine; their making ready the arrow upon the string, signifies that they apply to it falsities that appear as truths; to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart, signifies to deceive those who are in truths from good. Bow here denotes the doctrine of falsity; arrow denotes falsity itself; to shoot denotes to deceive; and the darkness denotes appearances, for they reason from appearances in the world and from fallacies, by applying also the sense of the letter of the Word.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>"The wicked uncover the sword, and bend their bow, to cast down the miserable and needy. Their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_37_14.htm">Psalms 37:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_37_15.htm">15</a>).<p>By the sword is signified falsity fighting against truth, and by the bow is signified the doctrine of falsity. To cast down the miserable and the needy, signifies to pervert those who are in ignorance of truth and good. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, signifies that they shall perish from their own falsity; and their bows shall be broken, signifies that their doctrine of falsity shall be dissipated, which also is done after their departure out of the world; then their falsities destroy them, and their doctrine, so far as it concerns truths adjoined to falsities, is dissipated.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>"Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their arrows with a bitter word; that they may shoot in the hiding places at the perfect (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_64_3.htm">Psalms 64:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_64_4.htm">4</a>).<p>Because a sword signifies falsity fighting against truth, therefore, it is said they sharpen their tongue like a sword; and because an arrow signifies falsity of doctrine, therefore it is said "they bend their bow with a bitter word; to shoot in the hiding, places at the perfect," signifies the same as above to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart, namely, to deceive those who are in truths from good.</p><p>[15] In Jeremiah:<p>"They are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men, who bend their tongue, their bow is a lie; neither in the truth have they prevailed in the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, neither have they known me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_2.htm">9:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_3.htm">3</a>).<p>By adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men, are meant those who falsify the knowledges of truth and good; adulterers denote those who falsify the knowledges of truth, and the treacherous those who [falsify] the knowledges of good; concerning, such it is said that they bend the tongue, and that their bow is a lie, the bow denoting doctrine whence come the principles of falsity, and a lie denoting falsity; and hence it is also said, "in the truth they have not prevailed in the earth," that is, in the church, where genuine truths are; that those are of such a quality who are in a life of evil, and do not acknowledge the Lord, is signified by, "for they proceed from evil to evil, neither have they known me."</p><p>[16] In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, I cause to come up against Babel an assembly of great nations from the land of the north; their darts as of a mighty one, none shall return vain; set yourselves in array against Babel round about, all ye that bend the bow shoot against her, spare not the arrows; make the shooters heard against Babel, all that bend the bow encamp against her round about, let there be no escape for her" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_9.htm">50:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_42.htm">42</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_3.htm">51:3</a>).<p>By these words is described the total devastation of truth with those meant by Babel; these arrogate to themselves the Divine power, and indeed acknowledge the Lord, but deprive Him of all power of salvation, and thence profane Divine truths. And because the Lord very carefully provides that genuine truths may not be profaned, therefore, those [truths] are entirely taken away from them, and they are imbued with absolute falsities instead. By the assembly of great nations from the land of the north, are signified direful evils rising up from hell; the great nations denoting direful evils, and the land of the north denoting hell, where there is nothing but falsity; by their darts as of a mighty man, none shall return vain, is signified that thence they shall be imbued with absolute falsities. By "Put yourselves in array against Babel round about; all ye that bend the bow, shoot against her, spare not the arrows," is signified also as to all doctrinals; the total devastation of truth with them is signified by "all ye that bend the bow, camp against her round about; let there be no escape for her."</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>"I stir up against them the Medes, who will not esteem the silver, and in the gold they will not delight, whose bows will dash in pieces the young men, and the fruit of the belly they will not pity; so shall Babel be as the overthrowing of God, Sodom and Gomorrah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2220.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2220</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2246.htm">2246</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2322.htm">2322</a>.)</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>"In that day, every place where there were a thousand vines for a thousand of silver, shall even be for thorn-brake and bramble-bush. With arrow and with bow shall he come thither; because the whole land shall be thorn-brake and bramble-bush" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_23.htm">7:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_24.htm">24</a>).<p>The church devastated as to all truth and good is thus described; the quality of the church before, when genuine truths, which are truths from good, were there in abundance, [is described] by there being a thousand vines for a thousand of silver; a thousand vines denoting truths from good in abundance, a thousand of silver denoting that they are most highly esteemed because they are genuine; silver denoting truth, and a thousand many, thus, in abundance. But what the quality of the church became when vastated as to all truth and good, is described by these words, "with arrow and with bow shall be come thither; because the whole land shall be thorn-brake and bramble-bush." Arrow denotes falsity destroying truth, and the bow denotes the doctrine of falsity. A thorn-brake signifies falsity from evil, and a bramble-bush evil from falsity; the land denotes the church.</p><p>[19] In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be stirred from the sides of the earth. They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice resoundeth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, equipped as a man for war against thee, O daughter of Zion" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_22.htm">6:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_23.htm">23</a>).<p>The devastation of the church by the falsities of evil is described here also; what a people from the land of the north signifies, and a great nation from the sides of the earth, also what their voice signifies which resoundeth as the sea, and their riding upon horses, was explained in the article just preceding. That they lay hold on bow and spear signifies falsity of doctrine destroying truth, and a spear the falsity of evil destroying good; the daughter of Zion denotes the church.</p><p>[20] In the same:<p>"The whole land is a desolation, for the voice of the horseman and of the archers the whole city fleeth; they have entered the clouds, they have ascended into the rocks, the whole city is deserted, no one dwelling therein" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">4:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">29</a>).<p>This also may be seen explained in the article immediately preceding. The voice of the horseman and of the archers signifies reasonings from falsities, and assaults of the truth; the archers or those who bend the bow, denoting those who assault truths from falsities of doctrine; hence it is said the whole city fleeth, the whole city is deserted, city signifying the doctrine of the church.</p><p>[21] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah "hath lifted up an ensign to the nations from far, and behold the swift one shall come quickly, his arrows are sharp, and all his bows bent; the hoofs of his horses are counted as rocks, and his wheels as the whirlwind" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_26.htm">5:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_28.htm">28</a>).<p>By his arrows are sharp, and all his bows bent, are signified falsities of doctrine prepared to destroy truths; what is signified by the nations from far, and by the hoofs of the horses are counted like rocks, and by the wheels which are like a whirlwind, may be seen in the article just above, where they are explained.</p><p>[22] In Amos:<p>"He that handleth the bow shall not stand, neither the swift with his feet deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver his own soul. But the strong in his heart among the heroes shall flee naked in that day" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_15.htm">2:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Man's own intelligence is here described, and confidence therefrom that he can reason from falsities against truths. By, "he that handleth the bow shall not stand, and the swift with the feet shall not deliver himself," is signified that he who knows how to reason readily and skilfully from the doctrine and the memory which belong to the natural man, cannot provide anything for his own salvation, or stand in the day of judgment. The same is signified by, he that rideth the horse shall not deliver his own soul. By the strong in heart who shall flee in that day, is signified that he who therefrom trusts in himself that he can reason from falsities, shall then be deprived of all truth; by the strong in heart is meant one who trusts in himself on that account, and by naked, is signified, deprived of all truth.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>"God is a just judge, God, who is angry all the day; if [the evil] will not return, he hath sharpened his sword, he hath bent his bow, and directed it, and hath prepared for him the instruments of death, he maketh his arrows burning" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_7_11.htm">Psalms 7:11-13</a>).<p>It is here attributed to God, that He is angry with the wicked, that He sharpens His sword, that He bends and directs His bow, prepares instruments of death, and makes His arrows burning; but the spiritual sense means that man acts thus to himself. Those things are attributed to God in the sense of the letter, because that sense is natural, and for the natural man who believes that God is to be feared on account thereof; and fear with him operates as love does afterwards, when he becomes spiritual. It is therefore evident what is here signified by those words, namely, that the wicked man is angry with God, that he sharpens the sword against himself, and bends the bow and directs it, prepares the instruments of death, and makes his arrows burning. By, he sharpeneth the sword, is signified that he procures to himself falsity by which he fights against truths; by, he bended the bow and directs it, is signified that from falsities he makes for himself doctrine against truths; and by he prepareth the instruments of death, and maketh his arrows burning, is signified that from infernal love he makes for himself principles of falsity, by which he destroys good and its truths.</p><p>[24] In Lamentations:<p>The Lord "hath bent his bow like an enemy; he stood with his right hand as an adversary, he slew all the desirable things of the eyes" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_4.htm">2:4</a>).<p>Here also similar things are attributed to the Lord, for a similar reason, as explained above. That He bends His bow like an enemy, and stands with His right hand like an adversary, signifies that the evil man does so to himself, that is, he defends evil against good, and falsity against its truths, from the doctrine which he has framed to himself from his own intelligence, and confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word. For in the Lamentations the vastation of all good and all truth with the Jewish nation, on account of the application of the sense of the letter of the Word to favour their own loves, is treated of; the bow there denotes the doctrine of falsity thence; the enemy denotes evil, and the adversary falsity. That, consequently, all understanding of truth and good perished, is signified by the Lord shall slay all the desirable things of the eyes, the desirable things of the eyes denoting all things belonging to intelligence and wisdom.</p><p>[25] In Moses:<p>"A fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall consume the earth with her produce, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. I will empty out evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them" (<a href="../njhd/248.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>.</p><p>[26] In the first book of Samuel:<p>"The bows of the mighty are broken, and they who were smitten were girded with strength" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_2_4.htm">2:4</a>).<p>This is a prophetic declaration of Hannah the mother of Samuel, in which the deprivation of truth with those who belonged to the church is treated of, because they had no spiritual affection of truth; also concerning the reception and enlightenment of those who were outside the church, because they had a spiritual affection of truth. That the doctrines of falsities in which those were who belonged to the church are as nothing, is signified by, the bows of the mighty are broken; and the reception and enlightenment of those who were outside the church, are signified by, they who were smitten were girded with strength; those are called smitten, who are bound by the falsities of ignorance; and strength is predicated of power and abundance of truth from good.</p><p>[27] In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, I break the bow of Elam, the beginning of his power" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_35.htm">49:35</a>).<p>By Elam is meant the knowledge (scientia) of the natural man, and confidence therefrom; by his bow is signified knowledge from which he fights as from doctrine; and by the beginning of his power is signified confidence; for knowledge avails nothing if it does not serve the rational and spiritual man. That by Elam is meant the knowledge which belongs to the natural man, is evident from those places where it is named in the Word (as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_21_2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24-26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_34.htm">49:34-39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_32_24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>).</p><p>[28] In David:<p>Jehovah "maketh wars to cease even to the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; he burneth the chariots with fire" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_46_10.htm">Psalms 46:10</a>).<p>Because by wars are signified spiritual combats, which are here those of falsity against the truth and against the good which belong to the church, it is hence evident what is signified by, Jehovah shall make wars to cease even to the end of the earth, namely, that all combat, and all disagreement [should cease] from the first to the last of the truth of the church, the end of the earth signifying its last. That there shall be no combat of doctrine against doctrine, is signified by, He shall break the bow; that there shall be no combat from any falsity of evil, is signified by, He shall cut the spear asunder; and that everything of the doctrine of falsity shall be destroyed, by, He shall burn the chariots with fire.</p><p>[29] In the same:<p>"In Salem is the tabernacle" of Jehovah, "and his dwelling place in Zion. There brake he the strings of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_76_1.htm">Psalms 76:1-3</a>).<p>The cessation of all combat and all dissension in the Lord's kingdom is here also treated of. By Salem where Jehovah's tabernacle is, and by Zion where His dwelling place is, are signified His spiritual kingdom, and His celestial kingdom; by Salem, the spiritual kingdom, where genuine truth is; and by Zion, the celestial kingdom, where genuine good is; and by, He shall break the strings of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the battle, is signified the dispersion of all combat of the falsities of doctrine against good and truth; the strings of the bow denoting the principal things of doctrine.</p><p>[30] In Hosea:<p>"In that day will I make a covenant for them with the beast of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the ground; and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle from off the earth, and I will make to lie down safely" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_2_18.htm">2:18</a>).<p>The Lord's advent is here treated of, and then His conjunction with all those who are in truths from good. By the covenant with the beast of the field, with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the ground, is signified conjunction with their affection of good, with their affection of truth, and with their affection for the knowledges of the truth and good that belong to the church; for the beast of the field signifies the affection of good; the bird of the heavens, the affection of truth; and the creeping thing of the ground, the affection for the knowledges of truth and good. That no beast, or bird, or reptile of the earth is here meant, every one sees; for how can any covenant be made with them? By, I will break the bow and the sword and the battle from off the earth, is signified that from conjunction with the Lord there shall exist no combat of falsity against truth; the bow here denotes doctrine, the sword denotes falsity, and the battle denotes combat.</p><p>[31] In Ezekiel:<p>"This is the day whereof I have spoken, then the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and they shall set on fire and burn the arms, and the shield and the buckler, with the bow and with the arrows, and with the handstaff, and with the spear, and they shall kindle a fire with them seven years" (<a href="../ae/257.htm">257</a>, <a href="../ae/299.htm">299</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 357</h4><p>357. That "a bow" signifies doctrine combating, or doctrine by which one fights against evils and falsities, and that "arrows," "javelins," and "darts," signify the truths of doctrine which fight, can be seen from the following passages. In Zechariah:<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace to the nations. Return to the stronghold, ye bound ones of hope; and I will bend Judah for Me, and with a bow I will fill Ephraim, and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, for Jehovah shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall blow with a trumpet, and He shall go in the storms of the south (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_12.htm">12-14</a>).<p>This treats of the vastation of the Jewish Church and the establishment of a church among the Gentiles. The vastation of the Jewish Church is described by "I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off," which signifies that there would be no longer any truth in the doctrine nor any understanding of truth, and thus no combat or resistance against falsity, "chariot" signifying the doctrine of truth, "horse" the understanding of truth, "the bow of war" combat from doctrine against falsity; it is said "the bow of war" because doctrine combating is meant. "Ephraim" signifies the church in relation to the understanding of truth, and "Jerusalem" in relation to doctrine. The establishment of the church among the Gentiles is described by these words, "but he shall speak peace to the nations; return to the stronghold, ye bound ones of hope; and I will bend Judah for me, and with the bow I will fill Ephraim, and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion," which signifies that the church is to be established among those who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in truths therefrom, "peace" signifying that good, "Judah" those who are in that good, and "Ephraim" those who are in the understanding of truth from it; it is therefore said of Ephraim, "with the bow He will fill him," that is, with the doctrine of truth. Their illustration in truths is described by these words, "His arrow shall go forth as lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall blow with the trumpet, and He shall go in the storms of the south;" the "arrow that shall go forth as lightning" signifies truth illustrated, thus truth from the good of love; "He shall blow with the trumpet" signifies the clear perception of good; and "the storms of the south" signify the clear understanding of truth, "the south" meaning the light of truth. This treats of the Lord, thus that these things are from the Lord.</p><p>[2] In Moses:<p>The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain; the daughters (she walketh upon the wall), they shall embitter him, and shall shoot; and the archers shall hate him; and he shall sit in the firmness of his bow, and the arms of his hands shall be strengthened by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; thence is he the shepherd, the stone of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6417.htm">6417</a>; and what else he signifies, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4592.htm">4592</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4963.htm">4963</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5086.htm">5086</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5087.htm">5087</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5106.htm">5106</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5249.htm">5249</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5307.htm">5307</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5877.htm">5877</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6224.htm">6224</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6526.htm">6526</a>)</p><p>[3] In the second book of Samuel:<p>David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan his son, and wrote, To teach the sons of Judah the bow (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>).<p>That lamentation treats of the combat of truth from good against the falsity from evil; for "Saul" as a king here signifies truth from good, for such truth is meant by "king" in the Word (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>).<p>"The blood of the slain" signifies the falsities conquered and dispersed; "the fat of the mighty" signifies evils conquered and dispersed. That these are conquered and dispersed by the doctrine of truth that is from good is signified by "the bow of Jonathan returned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty," "the bow of Jonathan" meaning doctrine, and "the sword of Saul" truth from good.</p><p>[4] In David:<p>God teacheth my hands war and placeth a bow of brass in mine arms (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_34.htm">Psalms 18:34</a>).<p>"War" here signifies war in a spiritual sense, which is war against evils and falsities; this is the war that God teaches; and "the bow of brass" signifies the doctrine of charity; God places this in the arms, that is, makes it to prevail.</p><p>[5] In Isaiah:<p>Who hath stirred up one from the sunrise, whom He hath called in righteousness to follow Him, hath given the nations before him, and made him to have dominion over kings, hath given them as the dust to his sword, and as stubble driven by his bow? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord and of His dominion over evils and falsities; the "nations that He gave before him," signify evils; and the "kings over whom He made him to have dominion," signify falsities; that He disperses evils and falsities as if they were nothing, by His Divine truth and by the doctrine therefrom, is signified by "He gave them as dust to his sword, and as stubble driven by his bow," "his sword" meaning the Divine truth, and "his bow," doctrine. That evils and falsities are dispersed as if they were nothing, is signified by "as dust," and "as driven stubble." It is said that evils and falsities are thus dispersed, but it is meant that those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom are thus dispersed in the other life.</p><p>[6] In Zechariah:<p>Jehovah [of Hosts] shall visit His flock, the house of Judah, and shall set them as the horse of His majesty in war. Out of him shall be the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the bow of war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">Zechariah 10:3-4</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the preceding article which treats of the signification of "the horse;" "the bow of war" signifying truth combating from doctrine.</p><p>[7] In Habakkuk:<p>Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? was Thine anger against the rivers? was Thy fury against the sea, that Thou dost ride upon Thine horses, Thy chariots are salvation? With bareness shall Thy bow be made bare (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/habakkuk_3_9.htm">9</a>).<p>This, too, was explained in the preceding article; "Thy bow shall be made bare" signifying that the doctrine of truth shall be laid open.</p><p>[8] In Isaiah:<p>Before the swords shall they flee away, before the drawn sword, and before the bended bow; and for the grievousness of the war all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed, and the remnant of the number of the bow of the mighty of the sons of Kedar shall be few (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_21_15.htm">Isaiah 21:15-17</a>).<p>This treats in the spiritual sense of the knowledges of good as about to perish, and that few will remain; "Kedar," that is, Arabia, signifies those who are in the knowledges of good, and in an abstract sense such knowledges themselves. That the knowledges of truth are to perish through falsities and the doctrine of falsity, is signified by, "Before the swords shall they flee away, before the drawn sword, and before the bended bow," "sword" meaning falsity combating and destroying, and "bow," the doctrine of falsity. That the knowledges of good are to perish is signified by these words, "for the grievousness of the war all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed," "the grievousness of war" meaning assault, and "all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed" meaning vastation. And that few knowledges are to remain is described by "the remnant of the number of the bow of the mighty of the sons of Kedar shall be few," "the bow of the mighty" meaning the doctrine of truth from the knowledges that prevail against falsities.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; He hath made me a polished arrow; in His quiver hath He hid me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>).<p>This also treats of the Lord; and "sharp sword" signifies the truth dispersing falsity; "the polished arrow" truth dispersing evil; and "quiver" the Word: this makes clear what is signified by "He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword," and "He hath made me a polished arrow, and in His quiver hath He hid me," namely, that in the Lord and from Him is the Divine truth, by means of which falsities and evils are dispersed, and that in Him and from Him is the Word, where and whence these truths are.</p><p>[10] In David:<p>Lo, sons are an heritage of Jehovah; the fruit of the belly is His reward. As arrows in the hands of a mighty one, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them; they shall not be ashamed when they speak with the enemies in the gate (<a href="../hh/428.htm">428-429</a>, <a href="../hh/538.htm">538-585</a>).</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>The sons of Ephraim, who were armed, shooters of the bow, turned about in the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_9.htm">Psalms 78:9-10</a>).<p>"Ephraim" here, as above, signifies the understanding of truth, and his "sons" the truths themselves; therefore they are also called "shooters of the bow," that is, fighters against evils and falsities. That they did not resist these because they were not conjoined to the Lord, is here signified by "they turned about in the day of battle, because they did not keep the covenant of God," "covenant" meaning conjunction, and "not keeping it" meaning not to live according to the truths and goods that conjoin.</p><p>[12] From the passages cited it can be seen that a "bow" signifies the doctrine of truth combating against falsities and evils and dispersing them. That this is the signification of "bow" can be seen further from its contrary sense, in which "bow" signifies the doctrine of falsity fighting against truths and goods and destroying them; and "darts" and "arrows" its falsities themselves. In this sense "bow" is mentioned in the following passages. In David:<p>Lo, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2</a>).<p>"The wicked bend the bow" signifies that they frame doctrine; "they make ready the arrow upon the string" signifies that they apply into it falsities that appear as truths; "to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart" signifies to deceive those who are in truths from good; "bow" here meaning the doctrine of falsity, "arrow" the falsity itself; "to shoot" meaning to deceive, and "darkness" appearances; for such as these reason from appearances in the world and from fallacies, also by the application of the sense of the letter of the Word.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>The wicked unsheathe the sword, and bend their bow, to cast down the miserable and needy. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_37_14.htm">Psalms 37:14-15</a>).<p>"Sword" signifies falsity fighting against truth, and "bow" signifies the doctrine of falsity; "to cast down the miserable and the needy" signifies to pervert those who are in ignorance of truth and good; "their sword shall enter into their own heart" signifies that they shall perish by their own falsity; and "their bows shall be broken" signifies that their doctrine of falsity shall be dispersed, which also takes place after their departure from the world; then falsities destroy them, and so far as they have applied truths to falsities their doctrine is dispersed.</p><p>[14] In the same:<p>Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrow with a bitter word, that they may shoot in secret places at the perfect <sup>1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_64_3.htm">Psalms 64:3-4</a>).<p>Because "sword" signifies falsity fighting against truth, it is said, "who sharpen their tongue like a sword;" and because "arrow" signifies the falsity of doctrine, it is said, "they aim their arrow with a bitter word" "to shoot in secret places at the perfect" signifies the like as "to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart," just before, namely, to deceive those who are in truths from good.</p><p>[15] In Jeremiah:<p>They are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous ones, who bend their tongue; their bow is a lie, neither in the truth have they prevailed in the land; for they go forth from evil to evil, neither have they known Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2-3</a>).<p>"Adulterers, an assembly of treacherous ones," mean those who falsify the knowledges of truth and good, "adulterers" meaning those who falsify the knowledges of truth, and "treacherous ones" those who falsify the knowledges of good; of these it is said that "they bend the tongue," and that "their bow is a lie," "bow" meaning the doctrine from which principles of falsity are derived, and "lie" meaning the falsity; it is therefore also said, "neither in the truth have they prevailed in the land," that is, in the church where genuine truths are; that those who are in a life of evil and do not acknowledge the Lord are such is signified by, "for they go forth from evil to evil, neither have they known Me."</p><p>[16] In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, I cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north; his arrows as of a mighty one, none shall return vain. Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow, shoot against her, spare not the arrows; make the shooters heard against Babylon, all that bend the bow encamp against her round about; let there be no escape for her (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_9.htm">Jeremiah 50:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_42.htm">42</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_3.htm">51:3</a>).<p>This describes the total devastation of truth with those who are meant by Babylon, who are those that arrogate to themselves Divine power, and who acknowledge the Lord, indeed, but take away from Him all power to save, and who thus profane Divine truths; and as the Lord as far as possible provides that genuine truths be not profaned, these truths are wholly taken away from them, and they are imbued instead with mere falsities. "An assembly of great nations from the land of the north" signifies direful evils rising up out of hell," "great nations" meaning direful evils and "land of the north" the hell where there is nothing but falsity; "his arrows as of a mighty one, none shall return vain" signifies that thence they shall be imbued with mere falsities thence; "set themselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow, shoot against her, spare not the arrows" signifies devastation in relation to all doctrinals; the total devastation of truth with such is signified by "all that bend the bow encamp against her round about; let there be no escape for her."</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>I stir up against them the Medes, who will not esteem silver, and in gold they will not delight; whose bows will dash in pieces the young men, and they will have no compassion on the fruit of the womb; so shall Babylon be, as the overturning of God, Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2220.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2220</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2246.htm">2246</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2322.htm">2322</a>)</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>In that day every place in which there were a thousand vines for a thousand of silver shall be a place of briers and brambles. With arrow and with bow shall one come thither, because the whole land shall be a place of briers and brambles (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_23.htm">Isaiah 7:23-24</a>).<p>The church vastated in relation to every truth and good is thus described; what the church had been before, namely, that genuine truth, which are truths from good, had been there in abundance is described by "in which there were a thousand vines for a thousand of silver," "a thousand vines" meaning truths from good in abundance, "a thousand of silver" meaning that these are most highly esteemed because they are genuine, "silver" meaning truth, and a "thousand" many, thus in abundance. But what the church became when vastated in respect to every truth and good is described by these words, "With arrow and with bow shall one come thither, because the whole land shall be a place of briers and brambles," "arrow" meaning falsity destroying truth, and "bow" the doctrine of falsity, "a place of briers" signifying falsity from evil, and "a place of brambles" evil from falsity; "land" means the church.</p><p>[19] In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth. They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no compassion; their voice resoundeth like the sea; and they ride upon horses arrayed as a man for war, against thee, O daughter of Zion (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22-23</a>).<p>This, too, describes the devastation of the church by the falsities of evil; what "a people from the land of the north" signifies, and "a great nation from the sides of the earth," also what "their voice resoundeth like the sea," and "they ride upon horses" signify, was explained in the preceding article; "they lay hold on bow and spear" signifies [that they fight from false doctrine, "bow" signifying] the falsity of doctrine destroying truth, and "spear" the falsity of evil destroying good; "daughter of Zion" meaning the church.</p><p>[20] In the same:<p>The whole land is a waste; for the voice of the horseman and of the shooters of the bow the whole city fleeth; they have entered into the clouds, they have ascended into the rocks, the whole city is forsaken, no man dwelling therein (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_29.htm">29</a>).<p>This, too, can be seen explained in the preceding article. "The voice of the horseman and of the shooters of the bow" signifies the reasonings from falsities, and assaults upon truth; "the shooters of the bow," that is, those who hold the bow, are those who assault truths from the falsities of doctrine; therefore it is said "the whole city fleeth," and "the whole city is forsaken," "city" signifying the doctrine of the church.</p><p>[21] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah hath lifted up an ensign to the nations from far, and behold the swift one shall come in haste, his arrows are sharp, and all his bows bent; the hoofs of his horses are reckoned as rock, and his wheels as a storm (<a href="../ae/355.htm">355</a>, where they are explained.</p><p>[22] In Amos:<p>He that holdeth the bow shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot deliver himself, nor shall he that rideth upon the horse cause his soul to escape, but he that is stout in his heart among the mighty shall flee naked in that day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_15.htm">Amos 2:15-16</a>).<p>This describes self-intelligence, and thus confidence from an ability to reason from falsities against truths; "he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot cause himself to escape," signifies that one who knows how to reason readily and skillfully from doctrine and from the memory that belongs to the natural man, cannot provide for his salvation, nor stand in the day of judgment; the like is signified by "he that rideth upon the horse shall not cause his soul to escape;" "he that is stout in his heart shall flee [naked] in that day" signifies that he who trusts in himself because of an ability to reason from falsities shall then be deprived of all truth; "the stout in heart" meaning him who trusts in himself on that account, and "naked" signifying deprived of all truth.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>God is a righteous judge, a God that is indignant all the day; if he turn not back He will whet His sword, He will bend His bow and make it ready, and hath prepared for him the instruments of death, He maketh His arrows burning (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_7_11.htm">Psalms 7:11-13</a>).<p>It is here attributed to God that He is indignant with the wicked, that He whets His sword, that He bends and makes ready His bow, prepares instruments of death, and makes His arrows burning; but in the spiritual sense it is meant that man does this in respect to himself. These things are attributed to God in the sense of the letter, because that sense is natural, and is for the natural man who believes that for these reasons God is to be feared; and with him fear works as love works afterwards, when he becomes spiritual. This makes clear what these words signify, namely, that it is the evil man who is indignant with God, that he whets the sword against himself, and bends the bow and makes it ready, he prepares the instruments of death, and makes his arrows burning. "He whetteth the sword" signifies that he acquires for himself falsity, by which he combats against truths; "he bendeth the bow and maketh it ready" signifies that from falsities he frames for himself doctrine opposed to truths; and "he prepares the instruments of death, and maketh his arrows burning" signifies that from infernal love he frames for himself principles of falsity by which he destroys good and its truth.</p><p>[24] In Lamentations:<p>The Lord hath bent His bow like an enemy; He hath stood with His right hand as an adversary; He hath slain all things desirable to the eyes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>).<p>Here, too, like things are attributed to the Lord, for a like reason as above; "He bends His bow like an enemy, and stands with His right hand as an adversary" signifies that the evil man does this in respect to himself, namely, he defends evil against good, and falsity against the truths of good from doctrine that he has framed for himself out of self-intelligence and confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word; for in Lamentations the vastation of all good and all truth with the Jewish nation, from their applying the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of their own loves is treated of; "bow" here meaning the doctrine of falsity therefrom, "enemy" evil, and "adversary" falsity. That in consequence all the understanding of truth and good would perish is signified by "the Lord hath slain all things desirable to the eyes," "things desirable to the eyes" meaning all things that are of intelligence and wisdom.</p><p>[25] In Moses:<p>A fire hath been kindled in Mine anger, and it shall devour the earth and its produce, and shall set in flames the foundations of the mountains. I will empty out evils upon them; I will consume Mine arrows upon them (<a href="../njhd/248.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 248</a>.)</p><p>[26] In the first book of Samuel:<p>The bows of the mighty are broken, but they who had stumbled have girded valor about them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_2_4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>).<p>This is the prophecy of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, which treats of the taking away of truth with those who are of the church, because they are in no spiritual affection of truth; also of the reception and illumination of those who are outside of the church, because they are in the spiritual affection of truth. That the doctrines of falsities that are held by those who are of the church are of no account is signified by "the bows of the mighty are broken;" and the reception and illustration of those who are outside of the church are signified by "they who had stumbled have girded valor about them;" those are said to "stumble," who are pressed by the falsities of ignorance, and "valor" is predicated of power and abundance of truth from good.</p><p>[27] In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, I break the bow of Elam, the beginning of his might (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>).<p>"Elam" means the knowledge [scientia] belonging to the natural man, and consequent confidence; his "bow" signifies the knowledge [scientia] from which as from doctrine he fights; and "the beginning of his might" signifies confidence; for knowledge [scientia] is of no avail if it does not serve the rational and the spiritual man. That "Elam" means knowledge belonging to the natural man can be seen from these passages in the Word in which "Elam" is mentioned (as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_10_22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_21_2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24-26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_34.htm">49:34-39</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_32_24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_32_25.htm">25</a>).</p><p>[28] In David:<p>Jehovah maketh wars to cease even to the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; He burneth up the chariots with fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_46_9.htm">Psalms 46:9</a>).<p>Because "wars" signify spiritual combats, which are here those of falsity against the truth and against the good of the church, it is clear what is signified by "Jehovah will make wars to cease even to the end of the earth," namely, that from firsts to the ultimates of the truth of the church all combat and disagreement shall cease, "the end of the earth" signifying the ultimates of the church. That there shall be no combat of doctrine against doctrine is signified by "He shall break the bow;" that there shall be no combat from any falsity of evil is signified by "He shall cut the spear asunder;" and that everything of the doctrine of falsity shall be destroyed by "He shall burn up the chariots with fire."</p><p>[29] In the same:<p>In Salem is the tabernacle of Jehovah, and His abode in Zion. There brake He the strings of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_76_2.htm">Psalms 76:2-3</a>).<p>This treats likewise of the cessation of all combat and all disagreement in the Lord's kingdom; "Salem" where Jehovah's tabernacle is, and "Zion" where His abode is, signify His spiritual kingdom and His celestial kingdom; "Salem" the spiritual kingdom where genuine truth is, and "Zion" the celestial kingdom where genuine good is and "He shall break the strings of the bow, the shield, the sword, and war" signifies the dissipation of all the combat of the falsities of doctrine against good and truth; "the strings of a bow" meaning the principal things of doctrine.</p><p>[30] In Hosea:<p>In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild beast of the field and with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and war from the earth, and I will make them to lie down securely (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>).<p>This treats of the Lord's coming and His conjunction at that time with all who are in truths from good; "the covenant with the wild beast of the field, with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the earth" signifies the conjunction with their affection of good, with the affection of truth, and with the affection of the knowledges of the truth and good of the church that they have; for "the wild beast of the field" signifies the affection of good, "the fowl of the heavens" the affection of truth, and "the creeping thing of the earth" the affection of the knowledges of truth and good. Everyone sees that no wild beast, or fowl, or creeping thing of the earth is here meant; for with these how could there be any covenant? "I will break the bow and the sword and war from the earth" signifies that because of conjunction with the Lord no combat of falsity against truth shall exist, "bow" here meaning doctrine, "sword" falsity, and "war" combat.</p><p>[31] In Ezekiel:<p>This is the day whereof I have spoken; then the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and they shall set on fire and burn the arms, both the shield and the buckler, with the bow and the arrows, and the hand staff and the spear, and they shall kindle a fire with them seven years (<a href="../ae/257.htm">257</a>, <a href="../ae/300.htm">300</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"Perfect" ("integrum") as below, the photolithograph has "wicked" ("inpium"). </p>
