<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 612</h4><p>612. The mystery of God shall be consummated, as he hath declared in good tidings (evangelizavit) to his servants the prophets.- That this signifies prediction in the Word concerning the coming of the Lord to be fulfilled when the end of the church is at hand, is evident from the signification of to be consummated as denoting to be fulfilled; and from the signification of the mystery of God which he hath declared in good tidings, as denoting the coming of the Lord, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of his servants the prophets, as denoting the truths of doctrine, in the present case, the Word. That those who are in truths from good are called servants of the Lord, may be seen above (n. <a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a>); and that now is the end of the church, may be seen in the small work on the <a href="../lj/33.htm">Last Judgment 33-39</a>, and n. 45-52, and following numbers).</p><p>[2] The end of the church is also meant by evening, and the coming of the Lord by morning, in the following passage in Daniel:<p>"Unto the evening and the morning two thousand three hundred" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_14.htm">8:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_26.htm">26</a>).<p>The evening signifies the end of the former church, and the morning, the coming of the Lord and the beginning of a new church. The signification of morning in these words in Ezekiel is the same:<p>"An evil, behold, is come. The end is come, the end is come; it hath watched over thee; behold, it is come. The morning cometh upon thee, O thou inhabitant of the land, the time is come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_5.htm">7:5-7</a>).<p>By the end here also is signified the end of the church, and by the morning, the coming of the Lord and the beginning of a new church are signified.<p>Similarly in Zechariah:<p>"It shall be one day which shall be known to Jehovah, not day nor night; because about the time of evening it shall be light" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">14:7</a>).<p>The one day which shall be known to Jehovah, means the coming of the Lord; the time of evening the end of the church, when all Divine Truth is obscured and falsified; while light signifies the Divine Truth manifested. This new light, or that morning which shall appear at the end of the church, is also here meant by the mystery of God which shall be consummated, as He hath declared in good tidings to His servants the prophets.</p><p>[3] Frequent mention is made in the Word of bringing good tidings (evangelizare) and of good tidings (evangelium), and the expressions signify the coming of the Lord, as is evident from the following passages.<p>Thus in Isaiah:<p>"O Zion, that bringest good tidings (evangelizatrix), lift up thy voice with strength, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God. Behold, the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and his arm shall rule for him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd" (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>). By Jerusalem are meant all those who are of the spiritual church, and these are they who are in the doctrine of genuine truth; it is therefore said, "lift up thy voice with strength which signifies confession from genuine truths. By the cities of Judah, to which it is said, "Behold your God, behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength," are signified doctrinals from the Word; cities, signify doctrinals; and Judah signifies the Word. That Zion and Jerusalem are called bringers of good tidings, because good tidings (evangelium), signify the coming of the Lord, is evident, for it is said, "Behold your God, behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength." That He will accomplish a judgment, and defend those who acknowledge Him, is signified by, His arm shall rule for him, he shall feed his flock like a shepherd.</p><p>[4] Again, in the same prophet:<p>"How delightful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy king shall reign, when he shall see eye to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">52:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_8.htm">8</a>).<p>These words also are spoken of the Lord's coming, and He is evidently meant by, thy king shall reign, and by, when he shall see eye to eye, that Jehovah returneth to Zion; similarly what follows in that chapter, this is the reason that mention is made of bringing good tidings. The rest of this verse may be seen explained above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_15.htm">1:15</a>).</p><p>[5] And in Isaiah:<p>"The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to bring good tidings unto the poor; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, to the bound, to the blind; to proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">61:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_2.htm">2</a>).<p>That these things are said concerning the Lord and His coming, is evident from what is said in Matthew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_3.htm">5:3</a>, and following verses), and in Luke (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_16.htm">4:16-22</a>). The coming itself is meant by the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance for our God. By the poor, the captives, the bound and the blind, to whom the Lord is said to bring good tidings, are meant the Gentiles, who are said to be such, because, not having the Word, they were in ignorance of truth. The Gentiles are also meant in Matthew by "The poor who hear the gospel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_4.htm">11:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_5.htm">5</a>).</p><p>[6] And in David:<p>"Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; declare the good tidings of his salvation from day to day; for Jehovah cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world with justice, and the peoples in his truth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_2.htm">Psalm 96:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_13.htm">13</a>).<p>The acknowledgment and celebration of the Lord with joy of heart on account of His coming, is signified by "Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; declare the good tidings of his salvation from day to day." The coming itself is described by "Jehovah cometh"; and because His coming is when the last judgment takes place, it is therefore said, "he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world with justice, and the peoples, in his truth." The earth means the church; the world means those in the church who are in the good of charity; and the peoples, those who are in truths thence. That it is the coming of the Lord when the Last Judgment takes place, was stated above, for then the evil will be separated from the good, or the goats from the sheep, and the evil will be judged to hell, and the good to heaven. This is also signified by the words of Isaiah in the above passage, "to proclaim the day for vengeance for our God, to comfort all that mourn." This is the reason that where the Last Judgment is treated of, mention is also made of declaring good tidings; as also in the following passages in the Apocalypse:<p>"And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people, saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_6.htm">14:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_7.htm">7</a>).<p>That when the end of the church takes place, the coming of the Lord will be proclaimed, is predicted by the Lord Himself in the gospels:<p>"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8-10</a>).</p><p>[7] That the coming of the Lord is understood by bringing good tidings and by good tidings, is also evident from the following passages.<p>Thus in Luke:<p>The angel said to Zacharias, "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_19.htm">1:19</a>).<p>And again:<p>"The angel said to the shepherds, Fear not, for behold, I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_10.htm">2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_11.htm">11</a>).<p>And again, in the same, it is said that John preached good tidings to the people concerning Jesus (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_16.htm">3:16-18</a>). And Jesus said, "the law and the prophets" were preached until John (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_16.htm">16:16</a>). The Lord Himself and also His disciples declared the good tidings of the kingdom of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_35.htm">9:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_1.htm">8:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_1.htm">9:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_6.htm">6</a>). The kingdom of God, means a new heaven and a new church from the Lord.</p><p>[8] Since declaring good tidings signifies to announce the coming of the Lord, hence by the gospel (good tidings), in the highest sense, is signified the Lord Himself as to His coming, as to judgment, and as to the salvation of the faithful, in the following passages in Mark:<p>Jesus said, "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_35.htm">8:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_29.htm">10:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_30.htm">30</a>).<p>He said to the disciples:<p>"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_15.htm">16:15</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 612</h4><p>612. The mystery of God shall also be finished, as He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets, signifies prediction in the Word respecting the Lord's coming, to be fulfilled when the end of the church is at hand. This is evident from the signification of "to be finished," as being to be fulfilled; also from the signification of "the mystery of God as He hath declared the good tidings," as being the Lord's coming (of which presently); also from the signification of "His servants the prophets," as being the truths of doctrine, here the Word. That those are called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths from good, may be seen above (n. <a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a>); and that now is the end of the church, in the little work on <a href="../lj/33.htm">The Last Judgment 33-39</a>, <a href="../lj/45.htm">45-52</a>, et seq.).</p><p>[2] The end of the church is meant also by "evening," and the Lord's coming by "morning" in Daniel:<p>Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_26.htm">26</a>).<p>"Evening" signifies the end of a former church, and "morning" the Lord's coming and the beginning of a new church. "Morning" has a similar signification in Ezekiel:<p>Behold an evil cometh, the end is come, the end is come; it hath awaked upon thee; behold it is come, the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land, the time is come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_5.htm">Ezekiel 7:5-7</a>).<p>Here, too, the "end" signifies the end of the church, and "morning" the Lord's coming and the beginning of a new church. So, too, in Zechariah:<p>It shall be one day that shall be known to Jehovah, not day nor night; for about the time of evening it shall be light (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">Zechariah 14:7</a>).<p>"One day that shall be known to Jehovah" means the Lord's coming, "the time of evening" the end of the church, when all Divine truth has been obscured and falsified; and "light" signifies Divine truth made manifest. This new light, or this morning which shall appear in the end of the church, is here meant also by "the mystery of God that shall be consummated, as He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets."</p><p>[3] In the Word, "to proclaim good tidings" and "good tidings" are frequently mentioned, and this signifies the Lord's coming, as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>O Zion, proclaimer of good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, proclaimer of good tidings, lift up thy voice with power; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God; behold, the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him; He shall feed His flock like a shepherd (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>). "Jerusalem" means all who are of the spiritual church, who are those that are in the doctrine of genuine truth, therefore it is said, "lift up thy voice with power;" which signifies confession from genuine truths. "The cities of Judah," to which it is said, "Your God, the Lord Jehovih, cometh in strength," signify doctrinals from the Word, "cities" signifying doctrinals, and "Judah" the Word. Evidently Zion and Jerusalem are called "proclaimers of good tidings," for the reason that "good tidings" mean the coming of the Lord, for it is said, "Behold your God, behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength." That He will effect judgment, and will protect those who acknowledge Him, is signified by "His arm shall rule for Him, He shall feed His flock like a shepherd."</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>How joyous upon the mountains are the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings, that maketh peace to be heard, that proclaimeth good tidings of good, that maketh salvation to be heard; that saith unto Zion, Thy king <sup>1</sup>shall reign, when he shall see eye to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_8.htm">8</a>).<p>This, too, is said of the Lord's coming, who is evidently meant by "thy king shall reign, when he shall see eye to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion," likewise in what follows in that chapter; this is why it is said "proclaim good tidings." (The rest of the verse may be seen explained above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).</p><p>[5] In Isaiah:<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed me to proclaim good tidings unto the poor; He hath sent me to bind up the broken in heart, to preach liberty to the captives, to the bound, to the blind; to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure and the day of vengeance for our God; to comfort all that mourn (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_61_2.htm">2</a>).<p>That this was said of the Lord and His coming is evident in Matthew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, et seq.) and in Luke (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-22</a>). The coming itself is meant by "the year of Jehovah's good pleasure and the day of vengeance for our God." "The poor to whom the Lord will proclaim good tidings," also "the captives," "the bound" and "the blind," mean the Gentiles who are said to be such because they have been ignorant of truth from not having had the Word. The Gentiles are also meant in Matthew by:<p>The poor hear the gospel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>).<p>In David:<p>Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good tidings of His salvation from day to day; for Jehovah cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in His truth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_2.htm">Psalms 96:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_96_13.htm">13</a>).</p><p>[6] The acknowledgment and celebration of the Lord with joy of heart because of His coming is signified by "Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good tidings of His salvation from day to day." The coming itself is described by "Jehovah cometh;" and as He comes when the Last Judgment is at hand it is said "He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in truth," "the earth" meaning the church, "the world" those in the church who are in the good of charity, and "the peoples" those who are in truths therefrom. That the Lord comes when the Last Judgment is at hand has been said above, for the evil will then be separated from the good, or the goats from the sheep, and the evil will be judged to hell, and the good to heaven; this also is signified by the words of Isaiah, just above, "to proclaim the day of vengeance for our God, to comfort all that mourn." This is why, where the Last Judgment is treated of, "proclaiming good tidings" is also mentioned, as also in the following in Revelation:<p>And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having the everlasting gospel to proclaim unto those that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_7.htm">7</a>).<p>That when the end of the church is at hand the good tidings of the Lord's coming will be proclaimed, is predicted also by the Lord Himself in the Gospels:<p>These good tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all the nations; and then shall the end come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8-10</a>).</p><p>[7] That the Lord's coming is meant by "proclaiming good tidings" and by "good tidings" can be seen also from the following passages. In Luke:<p>The angel said to Zacharias, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to proclaim to thee these good things (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The angel said to the shepherds, Be not afraid, behold I proclaim to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For there is born to you this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_11.htm">11</a>).<p>In the same:<p>That John proclaimed to the people the good tidings respecting Jesus (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_16.htm">Luke 3:16-18</a>);<p>Jesus said, The law and the prophets are proclaimed until John (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>).<p>And elsewhere:<p>That the Lord Himself and His disciples also proclaimed the good tidings of the kingdom of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_35.htm">9:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_1.htm">8:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_1.htm">9:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_6.htm">6</a>).<p>"The kingdom of God" means a new heaven and a new church from the Lord.</p><p>[8] Because "to proclaim good tidings" signifies to announce the Lord's coming, "the good tidings" in the highest sense signify the Lord Himself in relation to His coming, in relation to judgment, and to the salvation of the faithful, in these passages in Mark:<p>Jesus said, Whosoever shall wish to save his soul shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his soul for My sake and the Gospel's shall save it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_35.htm">Mark 8:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_29.htm">10:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_30.htm">30</a>).<p>Jesus said to His disciples, Going into all the world, preach ye the Gospel to every creature. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Latin has "King," the Hebrew "God," as found also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8331.htm">AC 8331</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 612 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>612. "Et consummabitur mysterium Dei, sicut evangelizavit servis suis prophetis." - Quod significet praedictionem in Verbo de adventu Domini implendam cum finis ecclesiae instat, constat ex significatione "consummari", quod sit impleri; ex significatione "mysterii Dei, sicut evangelizavit", quod sit adventus Domini (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "servorum suorum prophetarum", quod sint vera doctrinae, hic Verbum. <p>Quod "servi Domini" dicantur qui in veris ex bono sunt, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409" target=_top>409</a> [a]); et quod "prophetae" dicantur qui doctrinam docent, et quod in sensu abstracto sint doctrinae (de qua re videbitur infra); quod etiam sint Verbum, est quia Verbum est doctrina Divini Veri, et quia Verbum per prophetas conscriptum est, tum quia omne doctrinae erit ex Verbo. Ex his nunc sequitur quod per "consummabitur mysterium Dei, sicut evangelizavit servis suis prophetis" significetur praedictio in Verbo [de adventu] Domini implenda cum finis ecclesiae instat. Quod hoc per illa verba significetur patet ex mox praecedentibus, ut ex sequentibus: in mox praecedentibus dicitur quod hoc futurum "in diebus vocis septimi angeli", per quae intelligitur quod hoc futurum quando finis ecclesiae instat; in sequentibus, quod "postquam septimus angelus clanxit, dictum sit quod regna mundi facta sint Domini et Christi Ipsius"; et postea, quod "apertum sit templum Dei in caelo, ac visa sit arca foederis Ipsius in templo Ipsius (videatur cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_15-19" target=_top>11:15-19</a>). Idem etiam ex eo patet quod dum finis ecclesiae instat, Verbum aperiatur, et nova ecclesia instauretur: hoc quoque intelligitur per adventum Domini, nam Dominus est Verbum; quare hoc cum aperitur, apparet Dominus. Quod Verbum apertum fuerit quando Ipse in mundum venit, notum est; quod etiam nunc apertum sit per id quod sensus spiritualis Verbi revelatus sit, constare potest ex opusculo De Equo Albo; et in opere De Caelo et Inferno, (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_1" target=_top>1</a>); et quod nunc finis ecclesiae sit, in opusculo De Ultimo Judicio (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_33" target=_top>33-39</a>, et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_45" target=_top>45-52</a>, seq.).<p>[2] Finis ecclesiae etiam intelligitur per "vesperam", et adventus Domini per "mane", apud Danielem,<p>"Usque ad vesperam et mane, bis mille trecenta" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_14" target=_top>8:14</a> [, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_26" target=_top>26</a>]):<p>"vespera" significat finem ecclesiae prioris, et "mane" adventum Domini et initium ecclesiae novae.

Pariter apud Sachariam,<p>"Erit dies unus qui notus erit Jehovae, non dies nec nox, quia circa tempus vesperae erit lux" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_14_7" target=_top>14:7</a>):<p>per "diem unum qui notus Jehovae" intelligitur adventus Domini; per "tempus vesperae" intelligitur finis ecclesiae, quando omne Divinum Verum obscuratum et falsificatum est; et per "lucem" significatur Divinum Verum manifestatum. Haec nova lux, seu illud mane, quod in fine ecclesiae apparebit, intelligitur etiam hic per "mysterium Dei quod consummabitur sicut evangelizavit servis suis prophetis."<p>[3] In Verbo pluries dicitur "evangelizare" et "Evangelium", et per illud significetur adventus Domini, ut ex sequentibus locis constare potest:<p>- Apud Esaiam,<p>"Super montem altum ascende tibi, evangelizatrix Zion; extolle cum virtute vocem tuam, evangelizatrix Hierosolyma; .... dic urbibus Jehudae, Ecce Deus vester, ecce Dominus Jehovih in forti venit, et brachium Ejus dominabitur Ipsi; .... sicut Pastor gregem suum pascet" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_40_9-11" target=_top>40:9-11</a>):<p>quod haec de adventu Domini dicta sint, manifeste patet; inde est quod Zion et Hierosolyma dicantur "evangelizatrices": per "Zionem" intelliguntur omnes qui ab ecclesia caelesti sunt, qui sunt qui in amore in Dominum sunt; quare dicitur, "Ascende in montem altum"; per "montem altum" significatur ille amor (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_405" target=_top>405</a>): per "Hierosolymam" intelliguntur omnes qui ab ecclesia spirituali, qui sunt qui in doctrina genuini veri sunt; quare dicitur "Extolle cum virtute vocem tuam", per quae significatur confessio ex genuinis veris: per "urbes Jehudae", ad quas dicitur quod "Deus vester, Dominus Jehovih in forti venit", significantur doctrinalia ex Verbo, per "urbes" doctrinalia, et per "Jehudam" Verbum: quod Zion et Hierosolyma dicantur "evangelizatrices" ex eo, quod "Evangelium" significet adventum Domini, patet, nam dicitur "Ecce Deus vester, ecce Dominus Jehovih in forti venit": quod judicium facturus sit, et tutaturus illos qui Ipsum agnoscunt, significatur per quod "brachium Ejus dominabitur Ipsi, sicut Pastor gregem suum pascet."<p>[4] Apud eundem,<p>"Quam jucundi sunt super montibus pedes evangelizantis, audire facientis pacem, evangelizantis bonum, audire facientis salutem, dicentis Zion, Regnabit <sup>1</sup></p><p>Rex tuus:.... cum oculo ad oculum viderit quod revertatur Jehovah Zionem" ( <sup>2</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_52_7" target=_top>52:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_612/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_52_8" target=_top>8</a>):<p>haec quoque dicta sunt de adventu Domini, qui intelligitur per "Regnabit <sup>3</sup></p><p>Rex tuus, quum oculo ad oculum viderit quod revertatur Jehovah Zionem"; similiter in sequentibus illius capitis; inde est quod dicatur "evangelizare."

ipse adventus describitur per "Jehovah venit": quoniam adventus Ipsius est quando ultimum judicium instat, ideo dicitur, "Venit ad judicandum terram, judicabit orbem in justitia, et populos in veritate"; per "terram" intelligitur ecclesia, per "orbem" intelliguntur illi in ecclesia qui in bono charitatis sunt, et per "populos" qui in veris inde: quod adventus Domini sit quando ultimum judicium instat, supra dictum est; tunc enim separabuntur mali a bonis, seu hirci ab ovibus, et mali judicabuntur ad infernum, ac boni ad caelum; hoc quoque significatur per Esaiae verba mox supra, "ad proclamandum diem vindictae Deo nostro, et ad consolandum omnes lugentes";
