<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 548</h4><p>548. But that they should torment them five months.- That this signifies that the understanding should be darkened by the falsities of evil, and be drawn away from seeing truth, so long as they are in that state, is evident from the signification of tormenting, which denotes to darken as to the understanding, and to be withdrawn from seeing truth, of which we shall treat presently; and from the signification of five months, as denoting so long as they remain in that state. To torment here signifies to darken as to the understanding, and to be drawn away from seeing truth, because it is stated of the locusts, and their power of hurting like scorpions, and by the locusts is meant the ultimate of the life of man, which is called the Sensual, and by the power of hurting like scorpions is signified the persuasive [power], which is of such a nature, as to take away from the understanding the light of truth, and bring on infernal darkness; therefore it now follows, that their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he strikes a man, for the scorpion signifies such a persuasive [power], as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/544.htm">544</a>). This is said to torment, because it is said above, that the locusts should hurt men, but should not kill them; and he who hurts, and does not kill, torments. The persuasive [power] also in the sensual man, that is in the falsities of evil, hurts the understanding by darkening and drawing it away from seeing truth, although it does not deprive it of the power of understanding and perceiving; and because it is compared with the pain inflicted by a scorpion when it strikes a man, it is said to torment.</p><p>[2] The reason why five months signify so long as men are in that state, is, that a month signifies a state, and the number five signifies somewhat, and hence also, so long as. Months signify states, because all times, in the Word, as ages, years, weeks, days, and hours, signify states of life; hence also months, see the <a href="../hh/162.htm">Heaven and Hell 162-169</a>).<p>That five signifies somewhat, is evident from those passages in the Word, where that number occurs. For the numbers 10, 100, 1000, signify much and all, hence five signifies somewhat. For those numbers which signify much, arise from the number five, which signifies somewhat, and the numbers that are compounded and derived, take their signification from the simple numbers, from which, by multiplication, they are compounded and derived, see above (n. <a href="../ae/429.htm">429</a>, <a href="../ae/430.htm">430:2</a>). The number five also signifies so long as, because it is said, five months, and by five months is there signified a state of duration. This signification of five months appears to be a remote one, from this fact, that man so long as he lives in the world, is in natural thought, and natural thought derives its ideas from spaces and times, and also from numbers and measures; for these things are proper to nature, because all things in nature are determined by them. But spiritual thought is without any fixed idea of space, time, number, and measure; and therefore it appears far fetched and strange to man in the world, that five months should signify "so long as that state continues," that is to say, so long as the state of the persuasion of falsity continues, for so long is the understanding darkened, and drawn away from seeing the truth; but when the persuasion of falsity is removed, man comes into the faculty of seeing truth, if he desire to see it, and this faculty is given to every man.</p><p>[3] That five, in the Word, signifies somewhat and some, also all of such a quality, and similar things, is clear from the following: Jesus said that the kingdom of the heavens is like to ten virgins of whom "five were wise, and five were foolish" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_2.htm">2</a>). The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins, because the kingdom of the heavens signifies the church, and a virgin has a similar signification; and ten virgins signify all who are of the church. It is said, that five were wise and five foolish, because five signifies some of them, or all who are of such a quality on one part. That a virgin signifies the church, is evident from many passages in the Word, where mention is made of the virgin of Zion, the virgin of Jerusalem, the virgin of Israel, for these signify the church.</p><p>[4] The same is signified by ten, and by five, in the parable of the Lord concerning the nobleman who gave talents (minoe, mna [Greek]) to his servants to trade with, and one made of his talent ten talents, and another made five talents of his talents, and therefore they had authority over as many cities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_13.htm">Luke 19:13-20</a>). The numbers ten and five were mentioned by the Lord, because ten signifies much, and five, somewhat; but by their trading is signified the acquisition and procuring of heavenly intelligence; and by their having authority over cities, is signified intelligence and wisdom, for a city signifies in the Word, doctrine, and to have authority over it, signifies to be intelligent and wise, and over ten cities, signifies much, and over five, signifies some.</p><p>[5] Also some, and all who are of such quality, are signified by the number five in the parable of the Lord concerning the rich man and Lazarus, in which it is said that the rich man told Abraham that he had five brethren, and he besought that Lazarus might be sent to them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">Luke 16:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_28.htm">28</a>). The rich man said that he had five brethren because by five are signified all who are of such a quality.<p>Similarly, in the parable of the Lord concerning those who were invited to the great supper, one of them excused himself on the ground that he had bought five yoke of oxen, and must go to prove them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_19.htm">Luke 14:19</a>). By oxen in the Word are signified the natural affections, and by five yoke of oxen are signified all those affections or disorderly desires that lead away from heaven; heaven and the church, in regard to spiritual nourishment or instruction, are signified by the great supper to which they were invited. Who cannot see that the number five in these four parables involves some interior truth, since it is used by the Lord?</p><p>[6] So again, in Isaiah:<p>"In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking with the lips of Canaan, and swearing to Jehovah of hosts. In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt" (<a href="../ae/223.htm">223:14</a>). Here, therefore, mention is made of five cities, as some at that time are meant, and also some truths of doctrine.</p><p>[7] So again:<p>"Gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two-three berries in the top of the bough, four-five in the branches of the fruitful tree" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_17_6.htm">17:6</a>).<p>And Jesus said in Luke:<p>"From henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_52.htm">12:52</a>).<p>That in these passages five also signifies some, and all who are of such a quality, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_22_1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>). Here an ox, in the spiritual sense, means the good of the natural man; by restoring five oxen for an ox, is signified that he shall sufficiently amend what he had perverted and extinguished. To steal means to take away, to kill is to extinguish, and to sell is to pervert.</p><p>[8] By the fifth part also is signified as much as is sufficient in the following passages: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_5_16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_6_5.htm">6:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_22_14.htm">22:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_13.htm">27:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_5_6.htm">Num. 5:6-8</a>. The same is also signified by the fifths which Pharaoh took up from the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_41_34.htm">Genesis 41:34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_47_24.htm">47:24</a>). Again, the same is signified by Abner's smiting Asahel with the hinder end of his spear at the fifth [rib] (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_2_23.htm">2 Sam. 2:23</a>); at the fifth rib signifies as much as was sufficient for death; for the same number that signifies somewhat, and the all of one part, also signifies as much as is sufficient, when it is used of quantity, and so long as, when it is used of time.</p><p>[9] Since this number signifies some, and the all of one part, therefore it also signifies little and few, when a great quantity, which is also marked by numbers, follows or precedes; for then the all of one part is respectively few.<p>Thus in Isaiah:<p>"One thousand at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_17.htm">30:17</a>).<p>And in Moses it is said among the curses that five should chase a hundred, and a hundred, ten thousand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_26_8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>). And in the Evangelists it is stated that the Lord fed five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_14_15.htm">Matthew 14:15-22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_6_38.htm">Mark 6:38-43</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_13.htm">Luke 9:13-16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_9.htm">John 6:9-13</a>). The taking up of twelve baskets of the fragments on that occasion signifies fulness, thus fulness of instruction, and also full benediction.</p><p>[10] In Luke by five are signified few, where it is said,<p>"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9595.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9595</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9604.htm">9604</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 548</h4><p>548. But that they should torment them five months, signifies that the understanding would be darkened and drawn away by the falsities of evil from seeing truth, so long as they were in that state. This is evident from the signification of "to torment," as being to have the understanding darkened and withdrawn from seeing truth (of which presently); also from the signification of "five months," as being so long as they are in that state. "To torment" here signifies to have the understanding darkened and drawn away from seeing truth, because this is said of the locusts and their power to hurt like scorpions, and "locusts" mean the ultimate of man's life, which is called the sensual, and the power to hurt like scorpions signifies a persuasiveness that can take away from the understanding the light of truth and induce infernal darkness; therefore it now follows that "their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man," for a "scorpion" signifies such persuasiveness (See above, n. <a href="../ae/544.htm">544</a>). This is said "to torment," because it is said above that "the locusts should hurt men, but should not kill them;" and that which hurts but does not kill, torments; and the persuasiveness also, which is of the sensual man that is in the falsities of evil, hurts the understanding by darkening it and drawing it away from seeing truth, although it does not deprive it of the faculty to understand and perceive; and because it is compared with the pain from a scorpion "when it striketh a man," it is said "to torment."</p><p>[2] "Five months" signify so long as men are in that state, because a "month" signifies a state, and "five" signifies somewhat, and thus so long as "months" signify states, because all times in the Word, as "ages," "years," "weeks," "days," and "hours," signify the states of life (See in the work on <a href="../hh/162.htm">Heaven and Hell 162-169</a>), so likewise "months." That "five" signifies somewhat can be seen from the passages in the Word where that number occurs; for the numbers ten, one hundred, one thousand, signify much and all, therefore "five" signifies somewhat; for the numbers that signify much arise from the number five, which signifies somewhat, and composite and derived numbers take their signification from the simple numbers of which by multiplication they are composed, and from which they are derived (See above, n. <a href="../ae/429.htm">429</a>, <a href="../ae/430.htm">430</a>). "Five" also signifies so long as, because it is said "five months," and "months" here signify a state of duration. This signification of "five months" seems remote, because so long as man lives in the world he is in natural thought, and natural thought derives its ideas from spaces and times and also from numbers and measures; for these are proper to nature, because all things in nature are determined by them; while spiritual thought is without any determinate idea of space, time, number, and measure. For this reason it seems remote and strange to a man in the world, that "five months" should signify so long as that state, that is, a state of the persuasion of falsity continues, for so long the understanding is darkened and drawn away from seeing truth; but when the persuasion of falsity is removed man comes into the faculty to see truth if he wishes to see it, for every man has this faculty.</p><p>[3] That "five" signifies in the Word somewhat and some, likewise all such, and like things, can be seen from the following passages. In Matthew:<p>Jesus said that the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins, five of whom were prudent, and five foolish (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_2.htm">2</a>).<p>The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins, because "the kingdom of the heavens" signifies the church, as does a "virgin;" and "ten virgins" signify all who are of the church; it is said that "five were prudent and five foolish," because "five" signifies some of them, or all who are such on the one part. That a "virgin" signifies the church can be seen from many passages in the Word where mention is made of "the virgin of Zion," "the virgin of Jerusalem," "the virgin of Israel," by whom the church is signified.</p><p>[4] "Ten" and "five" have a like signification in the Lord's parable of the nobleman who gave to his servants pounds to trade with:<p>And one from a pound gained ten pounds; and another from a pound gained five pounds; and they were therefore to have authority over so many cities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_13.htm">Luke 19:13-20</a>).<p>The numbers "ten" and "five" are mentioned by the Lord, because "ten" signifies much, and "five" somewhat; while "their trading" signifies gaining or purchasing heavenly intelligence; and "authority over cities" signifies intelligence and wisdom, for "city" in the Word signifies doctrine, and "to have authority over it" signifies to be intelligent and wise; and "over ten cities" signifies much, and "over five" some.</p><p>[5] Again, some and all who are such, are signified by "five" in the Lord's parable of the rich man and Lazarus:<p>That the rich man told Abraham that he had five brethren, and asked that Lazarus might be sent to them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_27.htm">Luke 16:27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_28.htm">28</a>).<p>The rich man said that he had "five brethren" because "five" signifies all who are such. Likewise in the Lord's parable of those who were invited to the great supper:<p>That one excused himself because he had bought five yoke of oxen, and must go to prove them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_14_19.htm">Luke 14:19</a>).<p>"Oxen" signify in the Word natural affections, and "five yoke of oxen" signify all those affections or desires that lead away from heaven; heaven and the church in regard to spiritual nourishment or instruction are signified by "the great supper" to which they were invited. Who cannot see that the number "five" in these four parables involves an arcanum, since it was employed by the Lord?</p><p>[6] Likewise in Isaiah:<p>In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the lips of Canaan, and that swear to Jehovah of Hosts. In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt (<a href="../ae/223.htm">223</a>. So here it is said "five cities," to mean some at that time, and also some truths of doctrine.</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>There shall be left in it gleanings, as in the shaking of an olive-tree, two three berries in the top of the bough, four five in the branches of the fruitful one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_17_6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>Jesus said, From henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two, and two against three (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_52.htm">Luke 12:52</a>).<p>That in these passages "five" signifies some, and all who are such, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_22_1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>).<p>Here an "ox" means in the spiritual sense the good of the natural man; "to pay back five oxen for an ox" signifies that one should make sufficient amends for what he had perverted and extinguished; "to steal" means to take away, "to kill" to extinguish, and "to sell" to pervert.</p><p>[8] "The fifth part" also signifies as much as is sufficient, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_5_16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_6_5.htm">6:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_22_14.htm">22:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_13.htm">27:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_27_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_5_6.htm">Numbers 5:6-8</a>. Likewise:<p>The fifth part that Pharaoh took from the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_41_34.htm">Genesis 41:34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_47_24.htm">47:24</a>).<p>Likewise:<p>At the fifth [rib] at which Abner smote Asahel with the hinder end of his spear (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_2_23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>);<p>"at the fifth" signifying as much as was sufficient for death; for the same number that signifies somewhat, and all on the one part, signifies also as much as is sufficient, when it is predicated of quantity, and so long as, when it is predicated of time.</p><p>[9] As this number signifies somewhat, and all of one part, so it signifies also a little and a few whenever a great quantity that is also designated by numbers follows or precedes; for then all of one part is relatively a few. Thus in Isaiah:<p>One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_17.htm">Isaiah 30:17</a>).<p>And in Moses:<p>Among the curses it was said that five should chase an hundred, and an hundred, ten thousand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_26_8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>).<p>And in the Gospels:<p>That the Lord fed five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_14_15.htm">Matthew 14:15-22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_6_38.htm">Mark 6:38-43</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_13.htm">Luke 9:13-16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_9.htm">John 6:9-13</a>).<p>That they then took up "twelve baskets of fragments" signifies fullness, thus full instruction and full blessing.</p><p>[10] Again, "five" signifies few in Luke:<p>Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God. Fear not, therefore, ye are better than many sparrows (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9595.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9595</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9604.htm">9604</a>). </p>

Quod hoc per "menses quinque" significetur, apparet remotum, ex causa quia homo, quamdiu vivit in mundo, est in cogitatione naturali; et cogitatio naturalis trahit suas ideas ex spatiis et temporibus, et quoque ex numeris et mensuris; haec enim propria Naturae sunt, quia in Natura sunt omnia determinata per illa; spiritualis autem cogitatio est absque idea determinata spatii, temporis, numeri et mensurae: inde est quod appareat sicut remotum et alienum homini in mundo quod "menses quinque" significent quamdiu ille status est, hoc est, quamdiu status persuasionis falsi est; nam tamdiu intellectus caligat et abstrahitur a videndo verum; at cum persuasio falsi removetur, venit homo in facultatem videndi verum, si videre vult, quae facultas cuivis homini datur.<p>[3] Quod "quinque" in Verbo significent aliquid et aliquos, tum omnes tales, ac similia, constare potest a sequentibus locis:<p>- Apud Matthaeum,<p>Jesus dixit, quod regnum caelorum simile sit decem virginibus, quarum "quinque erant prudentes, quinque stultae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_1" target=_top>Matthaeum 25:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_2" target=_top>2</a>);<p>quod Dominus comparaverit regnum caelorum decem virginibus, est quia "regnum caelorum" significat ecclesiam, similiter "virgo"; et "decem virgines" significant omnes qui ab ecclesia: quod dixerit quod "quinque essent prudentes et quinque stultae", erat quia "quinque" significant quosdam ex illis, seu omnes qui tales ab una parte. <p>Quod "virgo" significet ecclesiam, constare potest ex pluribus locis in Verbo ubi dicitur "virgo Zion", "virgo Hierosolyma", "virgo Israel", per quas significatur ecclesia.<p>[4] Simile significatur per "decem" et "quinque" in parabola Domini<p>De homine nobili qui dedit minas servis suis ut negotiarentur, et quod unus ex mina acquisiverit decem minas, et quod alter ex mina acquisiverit quinque minas, et quod ideo potestatem habituri super tot urbes (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_19_13-20" target=_top>Luca 19:13-20</a>):<p>numerus decem et numerus quinque dicti sunt a Domino, quia "decem" significant multum, et "quinque" aliquid; per "negotiationem" autem illorum significatur acquisitio et comparatio intelligentiae caelestis; et per "potestatem super urbes" significatur intelligentia et sapientia, "urbs" enim in Verbo significat doctrinam, at potestatem super illam habere significat intelligens et sapiens esse, et "super decem urbes" significat multum, et "super quinque" aliquid.<p>  </p><p>[5] Etiam aliqui et omnes qui tales significantur per "quinque" in parabola Domini<p>De divite et Lazaro, quod dives dixerit Abrahamo se habere quinque fratres, et rogaverit ut Lazarus ad illos mitteretur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_27" target=_top>Luca 16:27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_28" target=_top>28</a>):<p>dixit dives quod haberet quinque fratres, quia per "quinque" significantur omnes qui tales sunt.
