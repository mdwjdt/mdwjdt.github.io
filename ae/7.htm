<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 7</h4><p>7. Things which must shortly come to pass. That this signifies, which will certainly take place, is evident from the signification of things which must come to pass, as being what will necessarily take place; and from the signification of shortly, as denoting what is certain and full (concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5284.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5284</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6783.htm">6783</a>). Those who view all things in the Word according to the sense of the letter, have no other idea than that shortly signifies shortly; that is, in the present case, that the things predicted in the Apocalypse were to take place shortly. Consequently they also wonder why so long a time should have elapsed before the accomplishment of the Last Judgment. But those who have a knowledge of the internal sense of the Word do not understand shortly as meaning shortly, but certainly. The reason why instead of shortly they understand certainly, is, because shortly implies time, and time is proper to nature; that is, shortly is a natural and not a spiritual expression, and all natural expressions, in the Word, signify spiritual things which correspond to them; for the Word internally is spiritual, but in the letter natural; this is why shortly signifies certainly. (That time is proper to nature, and, in the spiritual world, corresponds to state of life, may be seen in the work, Heaven and Hell, in the article concerning Time in Heaven, n. <a href="../hh/162.htm">162-169</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 7</h4><p>7. Things which must quickly come to pass, signifies which will certainly be. This is evident from the signification of "things which must come to pass," as being things that must needs be; and from the signification of "quickly," as meaning what is certain and full (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5284.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5284</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6783.htm">6783</a>). Those who look at all things in the Word according to the sense of the letter do not know otherwise than that "quickly" signifies quickly; thus here, that the things predicted in Revelation were to occur quickly; from which they are led to wonder that nevertheless so long a time has elapsed before the Last Judgment took place. But those who know the internal sense of the Word, do not understand "quickly," but certainly.<p>They see that "quickly" means certainly, because quickly involves time, and time is proper to nature; thus quickly is a natural, not a spiritual expression; and in the Word, all natural expressions signify the spiritual things that correspond to them; for the Word in its bosom is spiritual, while in the letter it is natural. Thence it is that "quickly" signifies what is certain. (That time is proper to nature, and, in the spiritual world, corresponds to state of life, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, in the chapter on Time in Heaven, n. <a href="../hh/162.htm">162-169</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 7 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>7. "Quae oportet fieri cito." - Quod significet quae certe futura, constat ex significatione "quae oportet fieri", quod sit quae necessario futura; et ex significatione "cito", quod sit certum et plenum (de qua n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_7/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5284" target=_top>5284</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_7/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6783" target=_top>6783</a>). Qui secundum sensum litterae omnia vident in Verbo, non aliter sciunt quam quod "cito" significet cito; ita hic quod illa quae in Apocalypsi praedicta sunt, cito futura sint; inde quoque miraturi quod usque tantum tempus, antequam ultimum judicium exstitit, praeterlapsum sit. Sed qui sciunt sensum internum Verbi, illi non intelligunt cito sed certum: causa quod pro "cito" intelligant certum, est quia cito involvit tempus, et tempus est proprium Naturae; ita cito est vox naturalis et non spiritualis, et omnes voces naturales in Verbo significant spiritualia quae illis correspondent; nam Verbum in sinu suo est spirituale, in littera autem naturale. Inde est, quod "cito" significet certum. (Quod tempus sit proprium Naturae, ac in spirituali mundo correspondeat statui vitae, videatur in opere De Caelo et Inferno, in articulo De Tempore in Caelo, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_7/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_162" target=_top>162-169</a>.) </p>
