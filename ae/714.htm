<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 714</h4><p>714. And, behold, a great red dragon.- That this signifies all who from the love of self are merely natural and sensual, and still have more or less knowledge from the Word, from doctrine therefrom, or from preaching, and who think that they will be saved by knowledge (scientia) alone without life, is evident from the signification of the dragon, as denoting the merely natural and sensual man, who has nevertheless a knowledge (scientia) of things in themselves spiritual, whether from the Word, from preaching, or from religion (concerning which we shall speak presently); and from the signification of great and red, as denoting to be in the love of self, and in its evils. For "great," in the Word, is used of good, and, in the opposite sense, of evil, as "much" is used of truths, and, in the opposite sense, of falsities (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/336.htm">336</a>, <a href="../ae/337.htm">337</a>, <a href="../ae/424.htm">424</a>); and "red" is used of love in each sense, namely, of celestial love, which is love to the Lord, and, in the opposite sense, of devilish love, which is the love of self (concerning which also see above, n. <a href="../ae/364.htm">364</a>). It is evident from these things that by "a great red dragon" are meant all those that are merely natural and sensual from the love of self, and still have more or less knowledge from the Word, either from doctrine therefrom, or from preaching, and who think they will be saved by knowledge alone without a life of charity. Such think they will be saved by knowledge alone without a life of charity, because all those who live for the body and the world, and not for God and heaven, become merely natural and sensual. For every one is formed interiorly according to his life; and to live for the body and the world is to live a natural and sensual life, and to live for God and heaven is to live a spiritual life.</p><p>[2] Every man is born sensual from his parents, and, by his life in the world, becomes more and more interiorly natural, that is to say, rational, according to moral and civil life, and the light (lumen) acquired therefrom; but he afterwards becomes a spiritual man by means of truths from the Word, or from doctrine from the Word, and by a life according to them. It is therefore evident that he who knows the things taught in the Word, or in doctrine or by a preacher, and does not live according to them, however learned and scholarly he may appear to be, is nevertheless not spiritual, but natural, in fact he is sensual, for knowledge (scientia) and ability to reason do not make man spiritual, but life itself. The reason of this is that knowledge and the consequent ability to reason are merely natural, and can therefore be enjoyed by the evil, indeed by the worst of men; but truths from the Word and a life according to them make man spiritual, for life means to will truths and to do them from a love for them, and this is not possible from the natural man alone, but from the spiritual, and from the influx of this into the natural. For to love truths, and from love to will them, and from such will to do them, is from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, and in its nature is heavenly and divine; this cannot flow in immediately into the natural mind, but mediately through the spiritual mind, which can be opened and formed for the reception of heavenly light and heat, that is to say for the reception of Divine Truth and Divine Good. These cannot flow immediately into the natural mind, because in this mind man's hereditary evils reside, which belong to the love of self and of the world; therefore the natural man, viewed in itself, loves only itself and the world, and from love wills, and from will does those evils, and these prevent anything from flowing out of heaven into the natural man and its reception there. It is therefore provided by the Lord that these evils may be removed, and thus a place given for the truths and goods of spiritual love, namely by the opening and formation of the spiritual mind, which is above the natural mind, and by means of the influx of heaven from the Lord through that mind into the natural mind.</p><p>[3] These things have been said, in order that it may be understood that to know the things of the Word, and of the doctrine of the church, does not make man spiritual, but a life according to those things which the Lord has commanded in the Word; consequently, that although men may know many things from the Word, they may yet remain natural and sensual. These are therefore those who are signified, in the Word, by the dragon. Such are signified by the dragon, because the dragon is a kind of serpent, which not only creeps upon the ground, but also flies, and thence (inde) it appears in heaven; and it is because of this flying and this appearance that those who are in the knowledge (scientia) of truths from the Word, and not in a life according to them, are meant by the dragon. For serpents in general signify the sensual things of man, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/581.htm">581</a>), and for this reason also the dragon is called the old serpent in the ninth verse of this chapter and in the second verse of the twentieth chapter.</p><p>[4] Since the dragon is treated of in the rest of this chapter, and also afterwards, it shall be stated who in general and particular are signified by it. In general it signifies those who are more or less natural, and who are yet in a knowledge of spiritual things from the Word. But in particular it signifies those who have confirmed themselves by doctrine and life, in faith separated from charity. These form the head of the dragon. But those who from their own intelligence have hatched for themselves dogmas from the Word are the body of the dragon; while those who study the Word without doctrine form the external parts of the dragon. All these also falsify and adulterate the Word, since they are in the love of self, and thus in the pride of their own intelligence, from which they become merely natural, and even sensual; and the sensual man cannot see the genuine truths of the Word, because of fallacies, obscurity of perception, and the evils of the body residing therein; for the Sensual clings to the body, whence such things come.</p><p>[5] (i) In the first place, the dragon means in general those who are more or less natural, and yet possess a knowledge of spiritual things from the Word, because serpents in general signify the sensual things of man, and thus sensual men; therefore the dragon, which is a flying serpent, signifies the sensual man, who nevertheless flies towards heaven, in that he speaks and thinks from the Word, or from doctrine from the Word. For the Word itself is spiritual, because in itself it is Divine, and is therefore in heaven. But it is not mere knowledge of spiritual things from the Word that makes man spiritual, but a life according to those things that are in the Word; therefore all those who have knowledge from the Word, and are not in a life according to that knowledge, are natural, indeed, sensual.</p><p>[6] The sensual, who are meant by the dragon, are those who see nothing from the light of heaven, but only from the light of the world, and who from this light alone are able to speak concerning Divine things, and also to reason with acuteness and readiness, when excited by the fire of the love of self and pride therefrom; but still they cannot see whether these things are true or not, declaring that to be the truth which from childhood they have imbibed from a master or preacher, and afterwards from doctrine, and which they have since confirmed by some passages of the Word not interiorly understood. Because these see nothing from the light of heaven, they do not see truths, but falsities in place of them, and these they call truths; for truths themselves can be seen only in the light of heaven, and not in the light of the world, unless the latter light be illuminated by the former. Because such is their character, they love no other than a corporeal and worldly life; and as the pleasures and lusts (concupiscentiae) of that life have their seat in the natural man, therefore the interiors of such are filthy and crowded with evils of every kind, which close up every entrance against the influx of the light and heat of heaven; consequently they are interiorly devils and satans, however much they may seem to be spiritual and Christians from their talk and simulated gestures. Such persons are utterly sensual, for outwardly they can talk about the holy things of the church, while inwardly they believe nothing; and those who think they believe, have a merely historical, and thus persuasive faith acquired from some teacher or from their own intelligence, which in itself is false; this they nevertheless hold, because it serves as a means to acquire fame, honour, and gain. Such in general are the dragons. But there are many that are signified in particular by the dragon, for there are some that have reference to the head, some to the body, and some to the external parts.</p><p>[7] (ii.) Those who have reference specifically to the head of the dragon are those who have confirmed themselves both in doctrine and life, in faith alone which is faith separated from charity. These have reference to the head of the dragon, because they are for the most part men of erudition and are believed to be learned; for they have confirmed themselves in the belief that they will be saved, by merely thinking about the things which the church teaches; and this they call believing. But the nature of their doctrine and their life shall be stated. Their doctrine is, that God the Father sent His Son, born from eternity, into the world, that He might become a man, fulfil all things of the law, bear the iniquities of all, and suffer the cross. That thereby God the Father was reconciled and moved to compassion, and that those who from confidence were in faith concerning these things, would be received into heaven; and that confidence in that faith, together with the Lord, would intercede and save. Consequently, that such a faith is given to mankind, who are separated from God the Father, as a medium of reception and salvation, because after Adam had eaten of the tree of knowledge (scientia) man was no longer in a state to do good of himself, having, with the image of God, thus lost his free will. Lastly, that the things above mentioned are the Lord's merit, by which alone man can be saved. These, as to doctrine, are the primary things of faith with those who are in faith alone. That no one can possibly perceive and thus believe any of these things from spiritual insight, which belongs to the understanding, but can know, and thus talk about them only from the memory, without understanding them, thus that there is nothing of intelligence in that doctrine, shall be explained and illustrated elsewhere, the Lord being willing.</p><p>[8] But what is the character of such as to life, shall also be explained. They teach that man is led of God by faith alone, even to the effort to do good, and that good itself in act contributes nothing to salvation, but faith only, and that then nothing of evil condemns him, because he is in grace, and is justified. They have also devised steps, which they call progressions of faith alone even to the last stage of justification. The first is information in such things as pertain to faith, especially in those mentioned above; the second is confirmation from the Word, or from preaching; the third is mental examination, whether it be so or not; and because doubt and consequent wavering - which is temptation - then flow in, confirmation from the Word concerning the operation of faith is necessary, whence a man has confidence and this is victory. They add that care must be taken that the understanding does not go beyond confirmations from the Word concerning justification by faith alone; and if it proceeds further, and is not kept under obedience to faith, the man succumbs. The fourth and last step is the effort to do good; this is an influx from God, and nothing of it is from man, being the fruit of faith; for they say that when a man is thus fully justified, nothing of evil afterwards condemns him, and nothing of good saves him, but faith alone. From these things the character of such persons as to life is evident, namely, that they live for themselves and not for God, and for the world and not for heaven; for this follows from the belief that evils do not condemn and that goods do not save. Nor do they know that faith without the life of charity is not faith, and that man ought to shun evils and do goods as of himself, nevertheless believing that it is from the Lord, and that otherwise evils cannot be shaken off, or goods appropriated. But more will be said on this subject elsewhere.</p><p>[9] Such is the doctrine and life with those who form the head of the dragon, who for the most part are learned dignitaries, with but few from among the common people; the reason is, that the former consider those things as secrets of theology which cannot be comprehended by the common people on account of their secular employments. These belong to the head of the dragon, because they also pervert and falsify all those things of the Word that teach love, charity, and life; for the Word, regarded in itself, is simply the doctrine of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbour, and in no case the doctrine of faith separated from charity. They falsify all things of the Word by calling them either faith, or a kind of fruit which they do not eat, because they give no thought to life; they are consequently not nourished by that fruit. Moreover they allow those principles to enter only as far as the memory, and from there to come into the thought nearest to it; this thought is sensual, in which there is nothing spiritual, and it does not examine whether a thing is true. Therefore they take care that nothing shall enter the interior sight which is of the understanding, being unwilling to know that all those things which we have stated concerning their faith are contrary to an enlightened understanding, as they are contrary to the genuine sense of the Word. It is for this reason that those who form the head of the dragon have no genuine truth, for from a false principle, such as that of faith alone, nothing but falsities in a continual series can proceed. Nor can there be any such thing as faith alone, for faith without charity is not faith, since charity is the soul of faith; therefore to speak of faith alone is to speak of that which is without a soul, and thus without life, a thing in itself dead.</p><p>[10] (iii) That those who, from their own intelligence, have hatched for themselves dogmas from the Word form the body of the dragon, is evident from this, that all those who study the Word and are in the love of self are also in the pride of their own intelligence; and all who are in this pride, and at the same time excel in cleverness from natural light (lumen) hatch dogmas for themselves therefrom. This is the origin of all the heresies and all the falsities in the Christian world. What intelligence from man's proprium is, and what that intelligence is which is not from his proprium, must be explained. The intelligence which is from a man's proprium is from himself, but the intelligence which is not from his proprium is from the Lord. All who are in the love of self have their intelligence from their proprium, for the love of self is the very proprium of man, and those are in the love of self who read the Word and collect dogmas from it for the sake of fame, glory, and honours. And as they are unable to see any truths, but can see falsities only, therefore they are in the body of the dragon; for they collect and hatch such things from the Word as favour their loves and the evils flowing from them; and such things as are contrary to their dogmas, which are truths from good, they either do not see, or they pervert. But all those who are in the spiritual affection for truth, that is, who love truth because it is truth, and because it is serviceable to eternal life, and to the life of the souls of men, have their intelligence from the Lord. It is said that their intelligence is not from their proprium, but from the Lord, because when they read the Word they are raised above their proprium, and even into the light of heaven, and are enlightened; in this light truth is evident from the truth itself, because the light of heaven is Divine Truth. But those who are in the love of self, and consequently in the pride of their own intelligence, cannot be raised up out of their own proprium, for they continually look to themselves, and they do this in everything. This is the reason why such place the whole duty of salvation in belief in their own dogmas, that is, in knowing and thinking, and not at the same time in the life, thus not at the same time in willing and doing. These, therefore, form the body of the dragon. The heart of this body is the love of self, and the breath (anima) of respiration, or his spirit is pride in [his] own intelligence; from these two the dragon is called a great red dragon, and the term red, in the original Greek text, is derived from fire-red, thus from love and pride.</p><p>[11] (iv.) Those who study the Word without doctrine, and who at the same time are in the love of self, form the externals of the dragon's body. Exteriors proceed from interiors, and involve, inclose, and contain them, like the skins, scales, and prominences on every part. Such form the externals of the body of the dragon, because they have no understanding of the spiritual things of the Word; for they know the Word only in the sense of the letter, which is of such a nature, that unless doctrine lights the way, it may lead into errors and falsities of every kind. Consequently, those who study the Word without doctrine are able to confirm as many heresies as they choose, and to embrace and also defend them by the loves of self and of the world, and the evils arising therefrom. For the sense of the letter of the Word is the ultimate sense of Divine Truth, and is therefore for the natural and sensual man, accommodated to its apprehension, and often so as to favour it; unless, therefore, it is read and viewed from doctrine, as from a lamp, it carries the mind away into darkness respecting many things pertaining to heaven and the church. And yet such believe themselves to be wise above all others, when, in fact, they are not wise at all.</p><p>[12] (v.) All those who form the dragon worship God the Father, and regard the Lord as a man like themselves, and not as God; and if they do regard Him as God, they place His Divine above His Human, and not within it. This will be made clear in what follows, where the combat of the dragon with Michael is treated of.</p><p>[13] (vi.) From this it is now evident that the tail of the dragon means the falsification and adulteration of the Word by those who form its head, its body, and its external parts; for its tail, as is the case with the tail of every animal, is a continuation of the spine (spinoe), which is an extension from the brains, and is therefore moved, bent, and lashed to and fro, according to the appetites, lusts, and pleasures of the head and body, which it, as it were, caresses. And as all those who form the dragon falsify and adulterate the Word because they are natural and sensual from the love of self, and are consequently proud of their own intelligence, it is therefore said that the dragon with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them unto the earth. The stars of heaven signify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, consequently truths from good therefrom; and to cast them unto the earth signifies to pervert and adulterate, and thus destroy them.</p><p>[14] That those above described form the dragon, and that the adulteration and destruction of the truths of the Word are meant by its tail, I have been permitted to see two or three times in the spiritual world; for all the things that appear in that world are representatives of spiritual things. When such persons were seen in the light of heaven, they were seen as dragons with a long tail, and when many such were seen, the tail appeared to be extended, from the south, through the west, into the north; and that tail was seen also to draw down, as it were, stars from heaven and cast them unto the earth.</p><p>[15] Since those above described are meant by the dragon, and the falsification and adulteration of the Word by its tail, therefore the habitation and bed of dragons, in the Word, signify where there is nothing but mere falsity and evil, as in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"The dry place shall become a pool, and the thirsty places springs of waters; in the habitation of dragons, its bed, grass instead of the reed and the rush" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_7.htm">35:7</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord's coming, and the establishment of a new church by Him among the nations; and these words mean that the truths and goods of the church will be where they were not before, even where there were falsities and evils. Where falsities and evils were before is signified by the dry and thirsty place, and by the habitation of dragons, also by the reed and rush; but the truths and goods which they will then have are signified by the pool, the springs of waters, the bed where dragons were before, and by the grass.</p><p>[16] In Jeremiah:<p>"I will make Jerusalem heaps, a habitation of dragons; and the cities of Judah will I reduce to a waste, that there be no inhabitant" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_11.htm">9:11</a>).<p>And in the same:<p>"The voice of a clamour, behold, a great tumult cometh from the land of the north, to reduce the cities of Judah to a waste, a habitation of dragons" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_22.htm">10:22</a>).<p>Jerusalem means the church as to doctrine; and the cities of Judah mean doctrinals, which are truths from the Word; the falsification of truth, and adulteration of good, from which mere falsities and evils arise, are signified by making Jerusalem heaps, and by reducing the cities of Judah to a waste, a habitation of dragons; for truth falsified is mere falsity, and good adulterated is mere evil. The voice of a clamour and a great tumult from the land of the north, signifies falsities fighting against truths, and evils against goods; the land of the north means where those are who are in falsities of evil.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>"Hazor shall become a habitation of dragons, a desolation even for an age; a man (vir) shall not dwell there, nor shall the son of man (homo) sojourn there" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a>).<p>Hazor signifies spiritual treasures, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word; the devastation of these even until they no longer exist, and falsities and evils take their place, is signified by "Hazor shall become a habitation of dragons, a desolation even for an age." That no truth of the church will remain is signified by "a man shall not dwell there, nor shall the son of man sojourn there," the son of man meaning the truth of the church.</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>"The thorn shall come up in her palaces, the thistle and bramble in her fortresses, that it may be a habitation of dragons, a court for the daughters of the owl" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_34_13.htm">34:13</a>).<p>This is said of Edom, and the nations, which mean those who are in falsities and evils; thorns, the thistle, and the bramble signify the falsities and evils in which they are; the dogmas defending them are signified by palaces and fortresses; while the devastation of all good and truth is signified by "a habitation of dragons," and "a court for the daughters of the owl," owls denoting those who see falsities as truths, and their daughters the lusts (concupiscentiae) of falsifying truths.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>"The Ijim shall answer in her palaces, and dragons in the temples" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_13_22.htm">13:22</a>).<p>This is said of Babel, which signifies the adulteration and profanation of good and truth; her palaces in which are the Ijim, and the temples where dragons are, signify the goods and truths of the Word and of the church, which are adulterated and profaned, the Ijim signifying adulterated and profaned truths, and dragons adulterated and profaned goods.</p><p>[20] In Micah:<p>"For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked, I will make a wailing like dragons, and a mourning like the daughters of the owl" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_8.htm">1:8</a>).<p>This treats of the vastation of Samaria, which signifies the spiritual church as to doctrine, in the present case that church vastated. To go stripped and naked signifies devastation as to truth and good; lamentation over it is signified by wailing and howling, lamentation over devastated good by making a wailing like dragons, and lamentation over devastated truth by making a mourning like the daughters of the owl. The wailing and mourning are said in a representative sense to be like that of dragons and daughters of the owl, also his going stripped and naked, stripped having a signification similar to that of the dragon, namely, to be destitute of goods, and naked, similar to that of the daughters of the owl, that is, to be destitute of truths.</p><p>[21] In Jeremiah:<p>"Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up as a sea-monster, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath driven me away. Let Babel be a heap, a habitation of dragons, a hissing and an astonishment, without inhabitant" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">51:34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_37.htm">37</a>).<p>Here also Babel and Nebuchadnezzar signify the adulteration and profanation of good and truth. He hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a sea-monster, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath driven me away, signifies the dispersion of all truth, and the destruction of all good therefrom. Sea-monster, signifies the same as dragon, both being denoted by the same word, in the original tongue. The devastation of all truth and good because of their adulteration and profanation is signified by Babel being a heap, a habitation of dragons, a hissing and an astonishment, without inhabitant, without inhabitant signifying good with no one.</p><p>[22] In Job:<p>"I walked darkened without the sun, I stood in the congregation, I cried out, I am become a brother to dragons, and a companion to daughters of the screech-owl (ululoe)" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_28.htm">30:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_29.htm">29</a>).<p>This is said of his state in temptations, in which man thinks himself condemned; therefore to walk darkened without the sun signifies to be like a devil, without the good of love; to stand in the congregation and cry out, signifies to be among truths and yet in falsities; to become a brother to dragons, and a companion to daughters of the screech-owl, signifies to be conjoined and to be one with those who are in evils without good and in falsities without truths, dragons denoting those who have adulterated goods and turned them into evils, and the daughters of the screech-owl those who do the same to truths.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>"Our heart is not turned back, neither hath our step declined from thy way, for thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_44_18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_44_19.htm">19</a>).<p>This also treats of temptations. That being thus shut off from influx out of heaven, as the sensual man is, he could not perceive what was good and true, is signified by God sore breaking him in the place of dragons, and covering him with the shadow of death, the place of dragons meaning the place in hell where those are who are dragons, that is, those who have destroyed all good in themselves; the falsity in which these are is called the shadow of death.</p><p>[24] Again:<p>"Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the asp, the lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot; because he hath set his desire upon me, I will deliver him, I will exalt him, because he hath known my name" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_14.htm">14</a>).<p>To destroy the interior and exterior falsities, which vastate the truths of the church, is signified by treading upon the lion and asp; and to destroy the interior and exterior falsities, which vastate the goods of the church, is signified by trampling under foot the lion and dragon. To lead away from falsities, and to lead to interior truths and goods him who is in doctrine from the Word, is signified by "I will deliver him, I will exalt him, because he hath known my name," to deliver meaning to lead away from falsities, to exalt, to lead to interior truths, and to know My name, to be in doctrine from the Word.</p><p>[25] In Malachi:<p>"Esau I hated, and I made his mountains a waste, and gave his heritage to the dragons of the wilderness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_1_3.htm">1:3</a>).<p>Esau means those who are in good as to the natural man, here those who are in evil as to the same; it is therefore said, "Esau I hated." That the goods of love of the natural man will be destroyed is signified by "I made his mountains a waste"; and that the truths of that good will be destroyed by the falsities of the sensual man is signified by I "gave his heritage to the dragons of the wilderness."</p><p>[26] Again in Ezekiel:<p>"Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon (or sea-monster) that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for my myself" (<a href="../ae/513.htm">513:5</a>).</p><p>[27] In Moses:<p>"Of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter, their wine is the venom of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps" (<a href="../ae/519.htm">519:7</a>), where it is shown that "their wine which is called the venom of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps," signifies that the truth of the church with the posterity of Jacob was external, in which interiorly there were infernal evils and falsities; dragons and asps signify sensual things which are the ultimates of the natural man, full of dreadful evils and of falsities confirming them. The reason of this is that the Natural then receives nothing from the Lord through the spiritual mind, consequently what it does receive is from hell.</p><p>[28] That the dragon signifies such things as have been stated above will be seen more fully from what follows in this chapter, namely, from his enmity against the woman about to bring forth, and fleeing into the wilderness; also from his combat with Michael; and still further in chaps. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_13.htm">16:13-15</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_2.htm">20:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_14.htm">14</a>, where it is said concerning him that he was bound for a thousand years, that afterwards, being loosed, he went forth to seduce the nations, and to gather Gog and Magog together to war against the saints, but that afterwards he was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone. It is evident from all these things that the dragon means those who do not possess any good of charity and love, because they do not acknowledge it to be a means serviceable for salvation, but regard it only as a kind of knowledge (scientificum) which from persuasion they call faith; and when the good of charity and love is not implanted by a man's life, evil takes its place, and where evil is there is falsity.</p><p>[29] Because serpents signify sensual things which are the ultimates of the natural man, and these are not evil except with those who are evil, and as in the Hebrew the same word <sup>1</sup>is used both for dragons and non-poisonous serpents, therefore dragons, when such serpents are meant by them, signify, in the Word, sensual things that are not evil, or, in regard to persons, sensual men who are not evil. That dragons and such serpents are expressed in Hebrew by the same word, is evident in Moses. When he was commanded out of the bush to cast his rod on the ground, and when it became a serpent (serpens) he took hold of it by the tail, and it became again a rod in his hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_3.htm">Exodus 4:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_4.htm">4</a>); and afterwards, Moses took the rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, when it became a serpent (dragon = draco), and the magicians did the like with their rods; but the rod of Moses then a serpent (dragon) - swallowed up the rods [or] serpents (dragons) of the magicians (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_7_9.htm">Exodus 7:9-12</a>). In the original the word rendered serpent in the former passage and the word so translated in the latter are different; in the former passage serpent (serpens) is the rendering of the word commonly employed for serpent in other parts of the Word, but in the latter place dragon (draco) represents the same word. This might also be translated thus, "When the rod of Moses was cast before Pharaoh it was changed into a dragon." It follows from this that the dragon, equally as the serpent, signifies, in a good sense, the Sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural man when not evil or not malignant.</p><p>[30] In this milder sense dragons are also mentioned in Isaiah:<p>"The wild beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the daughters of the owl, because I will give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_20.htm">43:20</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>"The hind brought forth in the field, but forsook it because there was no grass; and the wild asses stood upon the hills, they sniffed up the wind like dragons, their eyes were consumed because there was no herbage" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_6.htm">14:6</a>).<p>In these passages the word used for dragons is commonly used for serpents, and it is also applied to whales (ceti) in the sea, which also have the same signification, namely, the Natural of man in general, which is the Sensual, and therefore the last passage might be translated, "They sniffed up the wind like whales" (ceti). Similarly in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_4.htm">4</a>; and in David, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_14.htm">14</a>. There are also merely sensual men that are good.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;[Hebrew] </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 714</h4><p>714. And behold a great red dragon, signifies all who are merely natural and sensual from the love of self, and yet have more or less knowledge from the Word, from doctrine therefrom or from preaching, and think to be saved by knowledge alone apart from life. This is evident from the signification of "dragon," as being a man who is merely natural and sensual, and yet has a knowledge of things in themselves spiritual, whether from the Word or from preaching or from religion (of which presently); also from the signification of "great red," as meaning to be in the love of self and in its evils; for "great" is predicated in the Word of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, as "many" is predicated of truths, and in the contrary sense of falsities (See above, n. <a href="../ae/336.htm">336</a>, <a href="../ae/337.htm">337</a>, <a href="../ae/424.htm">424</a>), and "red" is predicated of love in both senses, namely, of celestial love, which is love to the Lord, and in the contrary sense of diabolical love, which is the love of self (of which also above, n. <a href="../ae/364.htm">364</a>). This shows that "a great red dragon" means all who are merely natural and sensual from the love of self, and yet have more or less knowledge from the Word or from doctrine therefrom or from preaching, and who think to be saved by knowledge alone without the life of charity. Such think to be saved by knowledge alone without the life of charity, because all who live for the body and the world, and not for God and heaven, become merely natural and sensual; for everyone is inwardly formed according to his life, and to live for the body and the world is to live a natural and sensual life, while to live for God and heaven is to live a spiritual life.</p><p>[2] Every man is born sensual from his parents; and by his life in the world becomes natural more and more interiorly, that is, rational, according to his moral and civil life and the lumen acquired therefrom; afterwards he becomes a spiritual man by means of truths from the Word or from doctrine from the Word, and by a life according to these truths. From this it can be seen that one who knows the things taught in the Word or in doctrine or by a preacher, and does not live according to them, however learned and erudite he may appear, is nevertheless not spiritual but natural, and even sensual, for knowledge [scientia] and the ability to reason do not make man spiritual, but the life itself.<p>This is so because knowledge and the faculty of reasoning are merely natural, and can therefore also be with evil men, even with the worst of men; but truths from the Word with a life according to them are what make man spiritual, for life is willing truths and doing them from a love of them; this is not possible to the natural man alone, but must come from the spiritual, and from its influx into the natural; for to love truths and from love to will them and from that will to do them is from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, and is in its nature celestial and Divine; this cannot flow in immediately into the natural mind, but only mediately through the spiritual mind, which is capable of being opened and formed for the reception of heavenly light and heat, that is, for the reception of Divine truth and Divine good. These cannot flow immediately into the natural mind, for the reason that man's hereditary evils, which belong to the love of self and the world, have their seat in that mind; therefore the natural man, viewed in itself, loves nothing but self and the world, and from love wills, and from will does those evils, and these block the way to the influx of anything out of heaven into the natural man, and its reception there; therefore it has been provided by the Lord that these evils can be removed, and for a place to be given for the truths and goods of spiritual love, namely, by the opening and formation of the spiritual mind which is above the natural mind, and by the influx of heaven from the Lord through that mind into the natural mind.</p><p>[3] This has been said that it may be known that to know the things that are of the Word and of the doctrine of the church does not make man spiritual, but a life according to those things that the Lord has commanded in the Word; therefore although such know many things from the Word they yet remain natural and sensual. Such are signified in the Word by "the dragon." They therefore are signified by "the dragon" because the dragon is a kind of serpent that not only creeps on the ground but also flies, and thence it appears in heaven; and it is because of this flying and appearing in heaven that the dragon means those who are in a knowledge of the truths from the Word, and not in a life according to them, "serpents" in general signifying the sensual things of man (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_2.htm">20:2</a>, is called "the old serpent."</p><p>[4] Since in the rest of this chapter and also afterwards "the dragon" is treated of, it shall be told what sort of persons, in general and in particular, it signifies. In general it signifies those who are more or less natural, and yet are in a knowledge of spiritual things from the Word. But in particular it signifies those who have confirmed themselves by doctrine and life in a faith separated from charity. These constitute the head of the dragon. But those who from self-intelligence hatch out for themselves dogmas from the Word constitute its body, while those who study the Word without doctrine constitute its external parts. All these also falsify and adulterate the Word, since they are in the love of self, and thence in the pride of self-intelligence, from which they become merely natural, yea, even sensual, and the sensual man is unable to see the genuine truths of the Word because of fallacies, obscurity of perception, and the evils of the body residing therein; for the sensual clings to the body, from which such things come.</p><p>[5] 1. In the first place, "the dragon" means in general those who are more or less natural, and yet are in a knowledge of spiritual things from the Word, because "serpents" signify in general the sensual things in man, and thence sensual men; therefore "the dragon," which is a flying serpent, signifies the sensual man who yet flies towards heaven in that he talks and thinks from the Word or from doctrine from the Word. For the Word itself is spiritual, because it is in itself Divine, and is therefore in heaven. But since the mere knowledge of spiritual things from the Word does not make man spiritual, but a life according to those things that are in the Word, therefore all of those who are in knowledge from the Word and are not in a life according to that knowledge are natural and even sensual.</p><p>[6] The sensual who are meant by "the dragon" are those who do not see anything from the light of heaven, but only from the light of the world, and who from that light alone, when excited by the fire of the love of self and pride therefrom are able to talk about Divine things, and to reason keenly and readily about them; but yet they are unable to see whether these things be truths or not, calling that truth which they have imbibed from childhood from a master or preacher, and then from doctrine, and which they have afterwards confirmed by some passages of the Word not interiorly understood. Because they see nothing from the light of heaven they do not see truths, but in place of them falsities, which they call truths; for truths themselves can be seen only in the light of heaven, and not in the light of the world unless that light is illuminated by the light of heaven. These being such love no other than a bodily and worldly life; and as the pleasures and lusts of that life have their seat in the natural man the interiors of such are filthy and crowded with evils of every kind, which close up every way for the influx of the light and heat of heaven; consequently they are inwardly devils and satans, however much they may appear to be spiritual and to be Christians by their talk and simulated gestures. Such are merely sensual, for while they are able to talk outwardly about the holy things of the church, inwardly they believe nothing; and those who think they believe have only a historical and thence a persuasive belief derived from some teacher or from self-intelligence, which in itself is false, but which they believe for the sake of fame, honor, or gain. Such are meant in general by "dragons." But there are many that are signified in particular by the dragon, for there are some that have reference to the head, some to the body, and some to the external parts.</p><p>[7] 2. Those that have reference in particular to the head of the dragon are those who have confirmed themselves both by doctrine and by life in faith alone, which is faith separated from charity. These refer to the head of the dragon because most of them are erudite and are believed to be learned; for they have confirmed themselves in the belief that they are saved by simply thinking what the church teaches, which they call believing. But what their doctrine is and what their life is shall be told. Their doctrine is, that God the Father sent His Son, born from eternity, into the world, that He might become man, might fulfill all things of the law, might bear the iniquities of all and suffer the cross; and that thereby God the Father was reconciled and moved to compassion; and that those who from confidence were in a faith respecting these things would be received into heaven; and that the confidence of that faith, together with the Lord, would intercede and save; consequently that such a faith is given to mankind, who are separated from God the Father, as a medium of reception and salvation, because when Adam had eaten of the tree of knowledge man was no longer in a state to do good of himself, for he had thus lost, with the image of God, his free will; lastly, that these things are the Lord's merit, by which alone man can be saved. These in respect to doctrine are the primary things of faith with those who are in faith alone. Elsewhere, the Lord willing, it shall be explained and illustrated that no one can, from any spiritual sight, which is of the understanding, perceive and thus believe anything of this; but such things can be known and talked about only from the memory, without any understanding, thus that in that doctrine there is nothing of intelligence.</p><p>[8] Of what quality such as these are in respect to life shall also be stated. They teach that man is led of God by faith alone, even to the endeavor to do good, and that good itself in act contributes nothing to salvation, but faith alone does this, and that then nothing of evil condemns him, because he is in grace and is justified. Moreover, they have thought out the steps, which they call the progressions of faith alone, even to the last step of justification; the first is information as to the things that pertain to faith, especially those above mentioned; the second is confirmation from the Word or from preaching; the third is mental investigation whether it be so or not; and as doubt and consequent wavering, which is temptation, then flow in, there must be confirmation from the Word respecting the operation of faith, from which comes confidence, which is victory. They add that heed must be taken that the understanding be not allowed to go further than to secure confirmations from the Word respecting justification by faith alone; if it goes beyond this and is not kept in obedience to faith the man is overcome. The fourth and last step is an endeavor to do good; and this is an influx from God and not at all from man, and is the fruit of faith; for they say that after a man has thus been fully justified nothing of evil condemns him and nothing of good saves him, but faith alone. From this it is clear what such are in respect to life, namely, that they live for themselves and not for God, and for the world and not for heaven; for this follows from the belief that evils do not condemn and that goods do not save. Nor do they know that faith without the life of charity is not faith, and that man ought to shun evils and do good as of himself, and yet to believe that it is from the Lord, and that otherwise evils cannot be shaken off, nor goods appropriated. But more will be said also about this elsewhere.</p><p>[9] Such is the doctrine and the life with those who form the head of the dragon, who for the most part are the erudite leaders, but few are from the common people; and for the reason that the leaders regard these things as secrets of theology that cannot be comprehended by the common people because of their secular employments. These belong to the head of the dragon for the reason also that they pervert and falsify all the things of the Word which teach love, charity, and life; for the Word, viewed in itself, is simply the doctrine of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor, and nowhere the doctrine of faith separate from charity. Such falsify the Word by calling them either faith or such fruit as is not eaten, because they give no thought to doing, and thus they are not nourished by that fruit. Moreover, they admit these principles no further than into the memory, and therefrom into the thought nearest to it, which is sensual thought, in which there is nothing spiritual, and this thought does not inquire whether a thing is true; therefore they guard against the entrance of anything into the interior sight which is of the understanding, being unwilling to know that all these things respecting their faith said above are contrary to an enlightened understanding, as they are contrary to the genuine sense of the Word. This is why those who constitute the head of the dragon have no genuine truth, for from a false principle, such as faith alone, nothing can flow forth except falsities in a continual series; nor indeed can there be any such thing as faith alone, for faith apart from charity is not faith, since charity is the soul of faith, therefore to speak of faith alone is to speak of what is without a soul, thus without life, which in itself is dead.</p><p>[10] 3. That those constitute the body of the dragon who have hatched out for themselves from self-intelligence dogmas from the Word can be seen from this, that all of such who study the Word and are in the love of self are also in the pride of self-intelligence, and all who are in this pride and at the same time excel in cleverness from natural lumen, hatch out dogmas therefrom for themselves; this is the origin of all the heresies and all the falsities in the Christian world. It shall be told what the intelligence is that is from man's own [proprium], and what the intelligence is that is not from man's own. Intelligence from man's own is from self, but intelligence not from man's own is from the Lord. All who are in the love of self have intelligence from what is their own, for love of self is man's very own [ipsum proprium]; and those are in the love of self who read the Word and gather up dogmas from it for the sake of fame, glory, and honor; and as such are unable to see any truths, but can see falsities only, they are in the body of the dragon; for they gather up and hatch out such things from the Word as favor their loves and the evils that flow from them, and such things as are contrary to their dogmas, which are truths from good, they either do not see or they pervert; but all who are in the spiritual affection of truth, that is, who love truth because it is truth and because it is serviceable to eternal life and to the life of men's souls, have intelligence from the Lord. It is said that their intelligence is not from their own [proprium] but from the Lord, because when such read the Word they are elevated above what is their own and even into the light of heaven, and are enlightened; in that light truth appears from truth itself, because the light of heaven is Divine truth. But they who are in the love of self and in the pride of self-intelligence therefrom cannot be elevated out of their own, for they look to self continually, thus in every least thing they do. Thence it is that they place everything of salvation in faith in their own dogmas, thus in knowing and thinking, and not at the same time in life, that is, not in willing and doing. These, therefore, constitute the body of the dragon. The heart of this body is the love of self, and the breath of its respiration, or of its spirit, is the pride of self-intelligence; from these two the dragon is called "great red," and the term "red" [rufus] in the original Greek text is from fiery-red, thus from love and pride.</p><p>[11] 4. Those who study the Word without doctrine and are at the same time in the love of self, constitute the externals of the draconic body. Externals are what proceed from the interiors, and involve, inclose, and contain them, like the skins, the scales, and the prominences on every part. Such constitute the externals of the dragon's body because they are without the intelligence of the spiritual things of the Word; for they only know the Word in respect to the sense of its letter, which is such that, unless doctrine lights the way, it may lead into errors and falsities of every kind; consequently those who study the Word without doctrine are able to confirm as many heresies as they will, and also to embrace them, and also to protect them by the loves of self and of the world and the evils arising therefrom. For the sense of the letter of the Word is the ultimate sense of Divine truth, thus it is for the natural and sensual man, adapted to its apprehension, and often so as to favor it; consequently unless it is read and viewed from doctrine, as from a lamp, it carries the mind away into darkness respecting many things that pertain to heaven and the church. And yet such believe themselves to be wise above all others, when in fact they are not wise at all.</p><p>[12] 5. All those who constitute the dragon adore God the Father, and look upon the Lord as a man like themselves, and not as God, or if as God they place His Divine above His Human, and not within it. This will be illustrated in what follows, where the combat of the dragon with Michael is treated of.</p><p>[13] 6. From this it can now be seen that the "tail" of the dragon means the falsification and adulteration of the Word by those who constitute its head, its body, and its extremities; for its tail, like the tail of every animal, is a continuation of the spine, which is an extension from the brain, and thus it is moved, bent, and vibrated, according to the appetites, lusts, and pleasures of the head and body, which it caresses, as it were. And inasmuch as all those that constitute the dragon falsify and adulterate the Word, because they are natural and sensual from the love of self and thence are in the pride of self-intelligence, therefore it is said that "the dragon with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them unto the earth;" "the stars of heaven" signify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, thence the truths from good therefrom, and "to cast them unto the earth" signifies to pervert and adulterate and thus destroy them.</p><p>[14] That those above described constitute the dragon, and that the adulteration and destruction of the truths of the Word are meant by "his tail," it has been given me to see in the spiritual world two or three times, for in that world all things that are seen are representative of things spiritual. When such persons are seen in the light of heaven they are seen as dragons with a long tail; and when many such are seen the tail appears extended from the south through the west into the north, and that tail is also seen to draw down as it were the stars from heaven and cast them unto the earth.</p><p>[15] As those above described are meant by "the dragon" and the falsification and adulteration of the Word by his "tail," the "habitation" and "bed" of dragons in the Word signify where there is nothing but falsity and evil, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>The dry place shall become a pool, and the thirsty place springs of waters; in the habitation of dragons, its den, there shall be grass instead of the reed and rush (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_35_7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord's coming and of the establishment of a New Church by Him with the Gentiles; and these words mean that the truths and goods of the church shall be where they were not before, even where there were falsities and evils; where falsities and evils were before is signified by "the dry and thirsty place," and by "the habitation of dragons," also by "the reed and rush;" but the truths and goods that they will then have are signified by the "pool," the "springs of waters," the "den" where dragons were before, and the "grass."</p><p>[16] In Jeremiah:<p>I will make Jerusalem heaps, the habitation of dragons; and the cities of Judah will I reduce to a waste that there may be no inhabitant (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_9_11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>).<p>The voice of a clamor, behold, a great tumult cometh from the land of the north, to reduce the cities of Judah to a waste, a habitation of dragons (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>).<p>"Jerusalem" means the church in respect to doctrine, and "the cities of Judah" doctrinals, which are truths from the Word; the falsification of truth and the adulteration of good, from which come mere falsities and evils, are signified by "making Jerusalem heaps," and by "reducing the cities of Judah to a waste, a habitation of dragons," for truth falsified is mere falsity, and good adulterated is mere evil; "the voice of a clamor and a great tumult from the land of the north" signifies falsities fighting against truths, and evils against goods; "the land of the north" means where those are who are in falsities of evil.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>Hazor shall become a habitation of dragons, a desolation even forever; a man shall not dwell there, nor shall the son of man abide there (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_33.htm">Jeremiah 49:33</a>).<p>"Hazor" signifies spiritual treasures, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word; their devastation even until they are no more, but falsities and evils in their place, is signified by "Hazor shall become a habitation of dragons, a desolation even forever;" that there will be no truth of the church remaining is signified by "a man shall not dwell there, nor shall the son of man abide in her," "son of man" meaning the truth of the church.</p><p>[18] In Isaiah:<p>The thorn shall come up in her palaces, the thistle and bramble in her fortresses; that she may be a habitation of dragons, a court for the daughters of the owl (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_34_13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>).<p>This is said of Edom and of the nations, which mean those who are in falsities and evils; "the thorns, the thistle, and the bramble," signify the falsities and evils in which these are; the dogmas by which they are defended are signified by "palaces and fortresses;" the devastation of all good and truth is signified by "a habitation of dragons, and a court for the daughters of the owl," "owls" meaning those who see falsities as truths, and "their daughters" the lusts of falsifying truths.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>The ijim shall answer in her palaces, and dragons in the temples (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_13_22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>).<p>This is said of Babylon, which signifies the adulteration and profanation of good and truth; "her palaces" in which are the ijim, and the "temples" in which are dragons, signify the goods and truths of the Word and of the church, which are adulterated and profaned, "ijim" signifying adulterated and profaned truths, and "dragons" adulterated and profaned goods.</p><p>[20] In Micah:<p>For this I will lament and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a lamentation like dragons, and a mourning like the daughters of the owl (Mic. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_1_8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>).<p>This treats of the vastation of Samaria, which signifies the spiritual church in respect to doctrine, here that church vastated; devastation in respect to truth and good is signified by "going stripped and naked;" lamentation over it is signified by "lamenting and howling," lamentation over devastated good by "making a lamentation like dragons," and lamentation over devastated truth by "making a mourning like the daughters of the owl." The lamentation and mourning are said to be like that of "dragons and the daughters of the owl" in a representative sense; also "his going stripped and naked," "stripped" signifying, the like as the dragon, to be destitute of goods, and "naked," the like as the daughters of the owl, to be destitute of truths.</p><p>[21] In Jeremiah:<p>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up as a whale, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath thrust me out. Let Babylon become a heap, a habitation of dragons, a hissing and an astonishment, without inhabitant (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_37.htm">37</a>). Here, too, "Babylon" and "Nebuchadnezzar" signify the adulteration and profanation of good and truth. The dispersion of all truth, and thence the destruction of all good, is signified by "he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up as a whale, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath thrust me out," "whale" having a similar signification as "dragon," the same word being used for both in the original tongue. The devastation of all truth and good by their adulteration and profanation is signified by "Babylon shall become a heap, a habitation of dragons, a hissing and an astonishment, without inhabitant," "without inhabitant" signifying no good in anyone.</p><p>[22] In Job:<p>I walked blackened without the sun, I stood in the assembly, I cried out, I am become a brother to dragons and a companion to the daughters of the screech owl (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_28.htm">Job 30:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_30_29.htm">29</a>).<p>This is said of his state in temptations, in which man thinks himself to be damned; therefore "to walk blackened without the sun" signifies to be like a devil, without the good of love; "to stand in the assembly and cry out" signifies to be among truths and yet in falsities; "to become a brother to dragons and a companion to the daughters of the screech owl" signifies to be conjoined with and to be one with those who are in evils without good and in falsities without truths, "dragons" meaning those who adulterate goods and pervert them into evils, and "the daughters of the screech owl" those who do the same to truths.</p><p>[23] In David:<p>Our heart is not turned away backward, neither hath our step declined from Thy way, though Thou hast crushed us in the place of dragons, and covered us over with the shadow of death (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_44_18.htm">Psalms 44:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_44_19.htm">19</a>).<p>This, too, treats of temptations. That being then shut off, like a sensual man, from influx out of heaven, he did not perceive what is good and what is true, is signified by "God hath crushed him in the place of dragons, and covered him over with the shadow of death," "the place of dragons" meaning where those who are dragons are in hell, that is, those who have destroyed every good in themselves; the falsity in which these are is called "the shadow of death."</p><p>[24] In the same:<p>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder, the lion and the dragon shall he trample <sup>1</sup>on; because he hath set his love upon Me I will rescue him, I will set him on high because he hath known My name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_13.htm">Psalms 91:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_14.htm">14</a>).<p>To destroy the interior and exterior falsities that vastate the truths of the church is signified by "treading upon the lion and adder;" and to destroy the interior and exterior falsities that vastate the goods of the church is signified by "trampling on the lion and dragon;" to lead away from falsities and to lead to interior truths and goods one who is in doctrine from the Word is signified by "I will rescue him, I will set him on high, who <sup>2</sup>hath known My name," "to rescue" meaning to lead away from falsities, "to set on high" to lead to interior truths, and "to know My name," to be in doctrine from the Word.</p><p>[25] In Malachi:<p>Esau I hated, and made his mountains a waste, and gave his heritage to the dragons of the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_1_3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>).<p>"Esau" means such as are in good in respect to the natural man, here such as are in evil in respect to the same, therefore it is said, "Esau I hated;" that the goods of love of the natural man will be destroyed is signified by "I made his mountains a waste;" and that the truths of that good will be destroyed by the falsities of the sensual man is signified by "I gave his heritage to the dragons of the wilderness."</p><p>[26] In Ezekiel:<p>Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon (or whale) that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made myself (<a href="../ae/513.htm">513</a>.</p><p>[27] In Moses:<p>Their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields <sup>3</sup>of Gomorrah; his grapes are grapes of gall, his <sup>4</sup>clusters of bitternesses. Their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel gall of asps (<a href="../ae/519.htm">519</a>. There, too, "their wine," which is called "the poison of dragons and the cruel gall of asps," signifies that the truth of the church with the posterity of Jacob was external, in which inwardly there were infernal evils and falsities; "dragons and asps" signify sensual things which are the ultimates of the natural man full of horrible evils and falsities confirming them, and for the reason that the natural then receives nothing through the spiritual mind from the Lord, consequently what it receives is from hell.</p><p>[28] That "the dragon" signifies such things as have been stated above can be seen more fully from what follows in this chapter, namely, from his enmity against the woman about to bring forth and fleeing into the wilderness; also from his combat with Michael; and still further in chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13-15</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_14.htm">14</a>, where it is said of him that "he was bound a thousand years, and afterwards being loosed he went forth to seduce the nations, and to gather Gog and Magog together to battle against the saints," and that afterwards "he was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone;" from all of which it can be seen that "the dragon" means those who possess no good of charity and love because they do not acknowledge it to be any medium serviceable to salvation, but make it a kind of knowledge [scientificum] which from persuasion they call faith; and when the good of charity and love is not implanted by the life of man there is evil in place of it, and where there is evil there is falsity.</p><p>[29] Because "serpents" signify sensual things, which are the ultimates of the natural man, and these are not evil except with those who are evil, and because the word in the Hebrew that means dragon [tannin] is the same as that which means serpents not venemous, so when such serpents are meant by "dragons" they signify in the Word sensual things not evil, or as applied to persons, sensual men who are not evil. That the same word in Hebrew means dragons and such serpents can be seen in Moses:<p>When he was commanded out of the bush to cast his rod to the earth, and when it was changed to a serpent, he took hold of its tail, and thereby it was changed again into a rod (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_3.htm">Exodus 4:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_4.htm">4</a>).<p>Moses took the rod and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it became a serpent [dragon], and the magicians did the like with their rods; but the rod of Moses, then a serpent [dragon], swallowed up the rods, the serpents [dragons], of the magicians (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_7_9.htm">Exodus 7:9-12</a>).<p>The word rendered serpent in the former passage and the one so rendered in the latter in the original language are different; in the former passage the word generally employed in other parts of the Word for serpent is used, but in the latter it is the same word as is translated "dragon;" thus it might also be rendered that when Moses' rod was cast before Pharaoh it was changed into a dragon. From this it follows that "dragon," the same as "serpent," signifies in a good sense the sensual which is the ultimate of the natural man when it is not evil or not wicked.</p><p>[30] It is in this milder sense that "dragons" are also mentioned in Isaiah:<p>The wild beast of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and the daughters of the owl, because I will give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the solitude, to give drink to My people, My chosen (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>The hind brought forth in the field, but forsook it, because there was no grass; and the wild asses stood upon the hills, they pant for wind like dragons, their eyes were consumed because there was no herb (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_5.htm">Jeremiah 14:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_14_6.htm">6</a>).<p>In these passages the word translated "dragons" is the same word commonly translated "serpents," and is also translated "whales" in the sea, and these have a similar signification, namely, man's natural in general which is the sensual; so the last passage might be translated, "they breathed out the wind like whales." (Likewise in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_29_4.htm">4</a>; and in David, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_13.htm">Psalms 74:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_14.htm">14</a>.) Moreover, there are men merely sensual who are good.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "shalt thou trample," as in <a href="../ae/632.htm">632</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;The Hebrew, as in text where first cited, has "because he."<br><br>3.&nbsp;The Latin has "waters" for "fields."<br><br>4.&nbsp;The Hebrew is "their," as found in <a href="../ae/519.htm">519</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2240.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2240</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 714 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>714. "Et ecce draco magnus rufus." - Quod significet omnes qui mere naturales et sensuales sunt ex amore sui, et usque sciunt plura aut pauciora ex Verbo, ex doctrina in de, aut ex praedicatione, ac putant per solam scientiam absque vita salvari, constat ex significatione "draconis", quod sit mere naturalis et sensualis homo, et tamen in scientia rerum in se spiritualium, sive haec sit ex Verbo, sive ex praedicatione, sive ex religione (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "magni rufi", quod sit esse in amore sui et in ejus malis, "magnum" enim in Verbo dicitur de bono, et in opposito sensu de malo, sicut "multum" de Veris, et in opposito sensu de falsis (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_336" target=_top>336</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337" target=_top>337</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_424" target=_top>424</a>); et "rufus" dicitur de amore in utroque sensu, nempe de amore caelesti, qui est amor in Dominum, et in opposito sensu de amore diabolico, qui est amor sui (de qua re etiam videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_364" target=_top>364</a>); ex his constare potest quod per "draconem magnum rufum" intelligantur omnes qui mere naturales et sensuales sunt ex amore sui, et usque sciunt plura et pauciora ex Verbo, vel ex doctrina inde, vel ex praedicatione, et putant per solam scientiam absque vita charitatis salvari; quod iidem putent se per solam scientiam absque vita charitatis salvari, est quia omnes illi fiunt mere naturales et sensuales qui vivunt corpori et mundo, et non Deo et caelo; nam quisque secundum vitam suam interius formatur, et vivere corpori et mundo est vivere naturalis et sensualis, at vivere Deo et caelo est vivere spiritualis.<p>[2] Unusquisque homo a parentibus nascitur sensualis, ac per vitam in mundo fit naturalis interius et interius, hoc est, rationalis, secundum vitam moralem et civilem, et inde comparatum lumen; at postea fit ille homo spiritualis per vera ex Verbo aut ex doctrina ex Verbo, ac per vitam secundum illa: inde constare potest quod qui scit illa quae Verbum, aut quae doctrina, aut quae praedicator docet, et non vivit secundum illa, utcunque doctus et eruditus appareat, non usque sit spiritualis, sed naturalis, immo sensualis; nam scientia et facultas ratiocinandi non facit spiritualem hominem, sed ipsa vita. Causa quod ita sit, est quia scientia et inde facultas ratiocinandi est modo naturalis; quare etiam dabilis est apud malos, immo apud pessimos; at vera ex Verbo una cum vita secundum illa faciunt hominem spiritualem, nam vita est velle vera ac facere illa ex amore illorum; hoc non dabile est ex solo naturali homine, sed ex spirituali, et ex hujus influxu in naturalem; nam amare vera, et ex amore velle illa, et ex e, a voluntate facere illa, est ex caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino, et est in sua natura caeleste et Divinum; hoc non influere potest immediate in mentem naturalem, sed mediate per mentem spiritualem, quae aperiri et formari potest ad receptionem lucis et caloris caelestis, hoc est, ad receptionem Divini Veri ac Divini Boni. Causa quod haec non immediate influere possint in mentem naturalem, est quia in hac mente resident mala hereditaria hominis, quae sunt amoris sui et mundi; inde naturalis homo in se spectatus non amat nisi semet et mundum, et ex amore vult illa, et ex velle facit illa; et haec sunt quae obstant quin e caelo illuc aliquid influere possit et ibi recipi; quapropter provisum est a Domino ut haec possint removeri, et sic possit. dari locus pro veris et bonis amoris spiritualis, nempe per aperitionem et formationem mentis spiritualis, quae supra mentem naturalem est, ac per influxum inde caeli a Domino per illam in mentem naturalem.<p>[3] Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quod scire illa quae Verbi sunt, ac quae doctrinae ecclesiae, non faciat hominem spiritualem, sed quod vita secundum illa quae Dominus in Verbo praecepit; proinde tametsi sciunt multa ex Verbo, quod usque naturales et sensuales maneant. Hi itaque sunt qui per "draconem" in Verbo significantur. Quod illi sint qui significantur per "draconem", est quia draco est genus serpentis, qui non modo repit humi, sed etiam volat, et inde apparet in caelo; ille volatus et haec apparentia est, ex quibus illi qui in scientia veritatum ex Verbo sunt, et non in vita secundum illas, intelligantur per "draconem": per "serpentes" enim in genere significantur sensualia hominis (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_581" target=_top>581</a>); inde quoque est quod draco (in hujus capitis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_9" target=_top>versu 9</a>, et quoque <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_714/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_2" target=_top>cap. 20 vers. 2</a>) dicatur "serpens antiquus."<p>[4] Quoniam in sequentibus hujus capitis, et quoque postea, agitur de "dracone", dicetur quinam in genere et in specie per illum significantur. In genere per illum significantur qui naturales sunt plus et minus, et usque in scientia rerum spiritualium ex Verbo sunt; in specie autem significantur qui se confirmaverunt in fide separata a charitate, doctrina et vita: hi caput ejus constituunt; qui autem ex propria intelligentia excluserunt sibi dogmata ex Verbo, hi corpus draconis faciunt; qui vero absque doctrina student Verbo, illi externa draconis formant. Hi omnes etiam falsificant et adulterant Verbum, quoniam in amore sui et inde in fastu propriae intelligentiae sunt, ex quo mere naturales, immo sensuales facti sunt; et sensualis homo non videre potest vera genuina Verbi, propter fallacias, propter obscurum perceptionis, et propter mala corporis ibi residentia; sensuale enim adhaeret corpori, unde talia sunt.<p>[5] (1) Quod primum, nempe quod per "draconem" in genere intelligantur qui naturales sunt magis et minus, et usque in scientia rerum spiritualium ex Verbo, est quia per "serpentes" in genere <sup>1</sup></p><p>significantur sensualia hominis, et inde sensuales homines; quare per "draconem", qui est serpens volans, significatur sensualis homo, qui usque versus caelum volat, per id quod loquatur et cogitet ex Verbo, aut ex doctrina e Verbo; ipsum Verbum enim est spirituale, quia est in se Divinum, et inde est in caelo: at quia sola scientia spiritualium ex Verbo non facit hominem spiritualem, sed vita secundum illa quae in Verbo sunt, inde omnes ex illis qui in scientia ex Verbo sunt, et non in vita secundum illam, naturales sunt, immo sensuales.<p>[6] Sensuales, qui per "draconem" intelliguntur, sunt illi qui nihil vident ex luce caeli, sed modo ex luce mundi, et qui ex hac sola luce possunt loqui de Divinis, et quoque acute et alacriter ratiocinari, excitante igne amoris sui ac inde fastu; sed usque non possunt videre num vera sint vel non vera, dicentes id verum esse quod ex pueritia hauserunt ex magistro aut praedicatore, et dein ex doctrina, ac postea confirmarunt ex aliquibus locis ex Verbo non interius intellectis. Hi quia nihil vident ex luce caeli, non vident vera, sed loco illorum falsa, quae vocant vera; nam ipsa vera non possunt videri nisi in luce caeli, et non in luce mundi, nisi haec illustrata sit ab illa. Illi, quia tales sunt, non aliam vitam amant quam corpoream et mundanam; et quia voluptates et concupiscentiae hujus vitae resident in naturali homine, inde interiora eorum sunt foeda, et omnis generis malis obstipata, quae claudunt omnem viam pro influxu lucis et caloris caeli; inde sunt interius diaboli et satanae, utcunque appareant ex loquelis ac simulatis gestibus sicut Spirituales et Christiani. Tales non sunt nisi quam sensuales; nam exterius loqui possunt de sanctis ecclesiae, et interius usque nihil credunt; et qui putant se credere, est historicum et inde persuasivum ex magistro aut ex propria intelligentia, in se falsum, quod creditur; cui tamen fides habetur quia inservit pro medio ad famam, honorem et lucrum. Tales in genere sunt dracones. Sunt autem plures in specie qui per "draconem" significantur; sunt enim qui referunt ejus caput, qui ejus corpus, et qui ejus externa.<p>[7] (2) Qui in specie referunt draconis caput sunt qui in sola fide, quae est fides separata a charitate, se confirmaverunt doctrina et vita; quod illi caput draconis referant, est quia plerique eorum sunt eruditi, et creduntur docti; confirmaverunt enim se quod per solum cogitare illa quae ecclesia docet, quod vocant credere, salventur: sed dicetur qualis est doctrina illorum, et qualis est vita illorum. Doctrina illorum est quod Deus Pater miserit Filium suum ab aeterno natum in mundum ut fieret homo, ut impleret omnia Legis, portaret omnium iniquitates, ac pateretur crucem; et quod per id Deus Pater reconciliaretur, et commoveretur misericordia, et quod reciperentur illi in caelum qui in fide de illis ex fiducia essent, et quod fiducia illius fidei una cum Domino intercederet et salvaret: proinde quod illa fides detur generi humano separato a Deo Patre, ut medium receptionis et salutis, quia homo postquam Adamus comederat ex arbore scientiae non amplius in statu faciendi bonum ex se esset, perdiderat enim inde cum imagine Dei liberum arbitrium; denique quod supradicta sint meritum Domini, per quod homo unice potest salvari. Haec sunt primaria fidei apud illos qui in fide sola sunt, quoad doctrinam. Quod nemo possit ex aliquo visu spirituali, qui est intellectus, quicquam ex illis percipere, et sic credere, sed modo talia ex memoria, absque intellectu, scire et inde loqui, sic ut illi doctrinae nihil intelligentiae insit, alibi, volente Domino, exponetur et illustrabitur.<p>[8] Quales autem iidem sunt quoad vitam, etiam dicetur. Docent quod homo per solam fidem ducatur a Deo usque ad conatum faciendi bonum, et quod ipsum bonum actu nihil faciat ad salutem, sed sola fides; et quod tunc nihil mali condemnet illum, quia est in gratia, ac justificatus. Excogitarunt etiam gradus, quos vocant progressiones solius fidei ad justificationis ultimum: primus est informatio in talibus quae fidei sunt, imprimis in illis quae supramemorata sunt: secundus est confirmatio ex Verbo, aut ex praedicatione: tertius est inquisitio mentalis, annon ita sit; et quia tunc influit dubitatio et inde vacillatio, quae est tentatio, quod confirmaturus sit se ex Verbo de fidei operatione, unde ei fit fiducia, quae est victoria; adjiciunt quod cavendum sit ne tunc intellectus ultra confirmationes ex Verbo de justificatione per solam fidem vadat; si ultra, et si intellectus non captivetur sub obedientia fidei, quod succumbat: quartus et ultimus gradus est conatus ad faciendum bonum, et quod is sit influxus a Deo, et nihil ab homine, et quod sit fructus fidei; dicentes quod, quando homo ita plene justificatus est, postea nihil mali condemnet illum, et nihil boni salvet, sed solum fides. Ex his constare potest quales illi sunt quoad vitam; quod nempe vivant sibi et non Deo, et mundo et non caelo; hoc enim sequitur ex fide quod mala non condemnent, et bona non salvent: nec sciunt quod fides absque vita charitatis non sit fides, et quod homo debeat mala fugere et bona facere sicut a se, et usque credere quod a Domino, et quod alioqui mala non queant discuti, nec bona appropriari: sed de his quoque alibi plura.<p>[9] Illa doctrina et haec vita est apud illos qui formant caput draconis, qui sunt quoad plurimam partem eruditi antistites, pauci autem ex vulgo: causa est quia illi reputant ea sicut abdita theologiae, quae a vulgo propter negotia non capi possunt. Quod illi sint dracones quoad caput, est quoque quia pervertunt et falsificant omnia Verbi, quae docent amorem, charitatem et vitam; nam Verbum in se spectatum est modo doctrina amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum, ac nullibi doctrina fidei separatae: falsificant illa per id, quod illa vocent vel fidem, vel fructum talem, quem, quia nihil cogitant de facere, non comedunt; proinde illo fructu se non nutriunt: praeterea nec admittunt illa principia ultra quam in memoriam, et inde in cogitationem ei proximam, quae est cogitatio sensualis, in qua nihil spirituale, quae cogitatio non explorat num verum sit; quare cavent ne aliquid intret visum interiorem, qui est intellectus; non volentes scire quod omnia illa quae de fide illorum dicta sunt, contra intellectum illustratum sint, sicut sunt contra genuinum sensum Verbi. Inde quoque est quod illis qui caput draconis constituunt, non aliquod genuinum verum sit; non enim ex falso principio, quod est sola fides, profluere possunt nisi falsa in continua serie; est enim sola fides non dabiliS, nam fides absque charitate non est fides; anima enim fidei est charitas; quare dicere solam fidem, est dicere quod absque anima, ita absque vita est, quod in se est mortuum.</p><p>[10] (3) Quod illi qui ex propria intelligentia excluserunt sibi dogmata ex Verbo corpus draconis constituant, constare potest ex eo, quod omnes ex illis, qui student Verbo ac in amore sui sunt, etiam in fastu propriae intelligentiae sint; et omnes qui in hoc fastu sunt, et simul ingenio ex naturali lumine pollent, illi excludunt sibi dogmata inde; ex hac origine sunt omnes haereses, et omnes falsitates in orbe Christiano. Dicendum est quid intelligentia ex proprio, et quid intelligentia ex non proprio. Intelligentia ex proprio est ex semet, at intelligentia ex non proprio est a Domino. Intelligentia ex proprio est omnibus illis qui in amore sui sunt, nam amor sui est ipsum proprium hominis, et illi in amore sui sunt qui legunt Verbum et inde colligunt dogmata propter famam, gloriam et honores; et quia illi non aliqua vera possunt videre, sed modo falsa, ideo in draconis corpore sunt; colligunt enim et excludunt talia ex Verbo quae favent amoribus illorum, ac inde scaturientibus malis; ac illa quae dogmatibus illorum contrariantur, quae sunt vera ex bono, vel non vident, vel pervertunt. Intelligentia autem ex Domino est omnibus illis qui in affectione veri spirituali sunt; hoc est, qui amant verum quia est verum, et quia inservit vitae aeternae, ac vitae animarum hominum. Dicitur quod intelligentia eorum non sit ex proprio sed ex Domino, quia hi elevantur a suo proprio dum legunt Verbum, et hoc usque in lucem caeli, ac illustrantur; in hac luce apparet verum ex ipso vero, quia lux caeli est Divinum Verum. At qui in amore sui sunt, et inde in fastu propriae intelligentiae, non elevari ex suo proprio possunt; spectant enim se continue, ita in singulis quae faciunt: inde quoque est, quod hi in fide suorum dogmatum ponant omne salutis, ita in scire et cogitare, et non simul in vita, ita non simul in velle et facere; ex his itaque est corpus draconis. Cor hujus corporis est amor sui; et anima respirationis, seu spiritus ejus, est fastus propriae intelligentiae: ex his duobus draco dictus est "magnus rufus", ac "rufus" in textu originali Graeco dicitur ex flammeo, ita ex amore et fastu.</p><p>[11] (4) Quod illi qui absque doctrina student Verbo, et simul in amore sui sunt, externa corporis draconiaci faciant. Externa sunt quae ab interioribus procedunt, et haec involvunt, claudunt et continent, ut sunt cutes, squamae, prominentiae ab undequaque: quod illi externa corporis draconis faciant, est quia absque intelligentia spiritualium Verbi sunt; sciunt enim Verbum quoad sensum litterae ejus, qui talis est ut, si non doctrina praeluceat, ducat in errores et falsa omnis generis; consequenter quod illi qui absque doctrina student Verbo, quotcunque volunt haereses, queant confirmare, et quoque amplecti, et quoque patrocinari amoribus sui et mundi, et inde oriundis malis: nam sensus litterae Verbi est ultimus sensus Divini Veri, ita pro naturali et sensuali homine, ad ejus captum, et saepe in ejus favorem; quare nisi ille legatur et spectetur ex doctrina, ut ex lucema, fert mentes in tenebras de multis quae caeli et ecclesiae sunt: et usque illi se .credunt prae omnibus sapere, cum tamen nihil sapiunt.</p><p>[12] (5) Quod omnes illi qui draconem constituunt, adorent Deum Patrem, et Dominum videant sicut hominem sui similem, et non ut Deum, si ut Deum, quod spectent Divinum Ipsius supra Humanum Ipsius, et non intra illud, in sequentibus, ubi agitur de pugna draconis cum Michaele, illustrabitur.</p><p>[13] (6) Ex his nunc constare potest quod per "caudam draconis" intelligatur falsificatio et adulteratio Verbi, ex illis qui caput ejus, qui corpus ejus, et qui <sup>2</sup></p><p>extrema ejus constituunt; cauda enim, sicut caudae cujusvis animalis, est continuatio spinae, quae protenditur a cerebris; et sic movetur, flectitur et vibratur secundum capitis et corporis appetitus, concupiscentias et voluptates, quibus quasi adblanditur: et quoniam omnes illi qui draconem constituunt, quia naturales et sensuales sunt ex amore sui, et inde in fastu propriae intelligentiae, falsificant et adulterant Verbum, ideo dicitur quod "draco cauda sua traxerit tertiam partem stellarum caeli, et projecerit illas in terram": per "stellas caeli" significantur cognitiones veri et boni ex Verbo, inde vera ex bono inde; et per "projicere in terram" significatur pervertere ac adulterare illa, et sic destruere.</p><p>[14] Quod illi qui supra memorati sunt constituant draconem, et quod adulteratio et destructio veritatum Verbi intelligatur per "caudam" ejus, bis et ter datum est mihi videre in mundo spirituali; in hoc enim mundo omnia quae apparent sunt repraesentativa spiritualium.
