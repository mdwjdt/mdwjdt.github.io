<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 556</h4><p>556. And their teeth were as the teeth of lions.- That this signifies that sensual things, which are the ultimates of the intellectual life, are to them apparently powerful over all things, is evident from the signification of teeth, which denote things sensual, which are the ultimates of the natural life as to the understanding, of which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of lions, which denote the truths of the church as to power, but which in this case, denote falsities destroying truths, thus also as to power, see above (n. <a href="../ae/278.htm">278</a>). Falsities are here denoted, because by the locusts are signified the corporeal sensual who are in the falsities of evil. The reason why they appear to themselves to be in understanding, and thence in power over all things, is, that the persuasive [power] itself, treated of above, resides in the Sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural life. For this [Sensual], or the sensual man, is in self-confidence, and in the belief that he is wiser than others, for he cannot weigh and explore himself, because he does not think interiorly; and when he is persuaded of this, then this confidence and belief are in every thing which he utters. Hence because the tone of his utterance is derived from these, it fascinates and infatuates the minds of others, for the tone of confidence and belief produces such an effect which is particularly manifest in the spiritual world, where a man speaks from his spirit. For the affection of self-confidence, and of the belief derived therefrom that a thing is so, is in the spirit of man, and the spirit of man speaks from affection. It is otherwise in the natural world, in which the spirit of man speaks by means of the body; and, on account of the world, brings forth such things as are not from the affection of his spirit, which he rarely manifests, lest the quality thereof should be known. This is the reason that it is not known in the world, that there exists a persuasive [power] of such an infatuating and suffocating quality as is in the spirit of the sensual man, who believes himself to be wise above others. From these things it is evident why by their teeth being like the teeth of lions is signified that sensual men appear to themselves to be as it were in understanding, and thence in power over all things. That teeth signify things sensual, which are the ultimates of the natural life as to knowledge (scientia), is evident from the correspondence of teeth, upon which see <a href="../hh/575.htm">Heaven and Hell 575</a>), and the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5565.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5565-5568</a>).</p><p>[2] That teeth have this signification is also evident from the following passages of the Word;<p>as in David:<p>"My soul, I lie down in the midst of lions; whose teeth are spear and darts, and their tongue a sharp sword" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>).<p>Lions signify those who by means of falsities destroy the truths of the church; their teeth, which are spear and darts, signify the scientifics (scientifica) which they apply to confirm falsities and evils, and so to destroy the truths and goods of the church. Their tongue a sharp sword, signifies crafty reasons from falsities, which are called a sharp sword, because a sword signifies falsity destroying truth.</p><p>[3] Again:<p>"O God, destroy their teeth, in their mouth; break out the jaw teeth of the young lions" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_58_6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>).<p>Their teeth in their mouth signify the scientifics from which they produce falsities; the jaw teeth of the young lions signify the truths of the Word falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and by means of which they are especially capable of destroying the truths of the church.</p><p>[4] So in Joel:<p>"A nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw teeth of a great lion. It reduces my vine to wasteness, and my fig-tree into foam" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4036.htm">4036</a>), where this is explained. The teeth of lions in these passages, signify the same things as the teeth as of lions here in the Apocalypse. Teeth properly signify those things which are in the memory only, and which are brought forth thence; for those things which are in the memory of the sensual man correspond to the bones and teeth.</p><p>[5] Again, in Daniel:<p>"A second beast like to a bear," came up from the sea, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it; and it was said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. Afterwards, a fourth beast came up, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and ground in pieces, and trampled the residue with the feet of it" (<a href="../ae/316.htm">316:15</a>).</p><p>[6] Again, in Moses:<p>"I will also send the tooth of beasts upon them, with the poison of the crawling things of the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_22_24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a>).<p>The Israelitish and Jewish people were threatened with this amongst many other evils, if they did not keep and do the statutes and commandments. By the tooth of beasts, are signified falsities from evils of every kind; and the poison of the crawling things of the earth, signifies those who kill, and altogether extinguish spiritual life. Beasts, in the Word, signify such things as pertain to the natural man, and crawling things of the earth, the things that pertain to the sensual man; and when these are separated from the spiritual man, they are simply falsities from evils, because they are such things as belong to the body only, to which they adhere, and to the world, to which they are closely related; and in spiritual things all thick darkness arises from the body and the world.</p><p>[7] Again, in David:<p>"Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God; for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheek; thou breakest the teeth of the ungodly" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_3_7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>).<p>Here, by smiting the enemies on the cheek, is signified the destruction of the interior falsities of those who are against the goods and truths of the church, such persons, with their falsities of evil, being meant by enemies in the Word. To break the teeth of the ungodly signifies to destroy exterior falsities, which are founded upon the fallacies of the senses, and confirmed by them.</p><p>[8] Since in David the expressions to smite the cheek, and break the teeth occur, and by them is signified to destroy interior and exterior falsities, the meaning of smiting on the cheek in Matthew is evident:<p>"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat (tunica = chiton), let him have thy robe (pallium = imation) also; and, whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to every one that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_38.htm">5:38-42</a>).<p>That these words are not to be understood according to the letter, is evident to every one. For who is bound by Christian love, to turn the left cheek to him who smites the right, and to give the robe to him who would take away the coat? In a word, who is there who is not allowed to resist evil? But because all things which the Lord uttered, were in themselves celestial Divine, it is evident that these words, as well as the rest which the Lord spoke, contain a celestial sense. The reason why the law was given to the sons of Israel, that they should give an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_23.htm">Exodus 21:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_19_21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>), was, that they were external men, and were consequently only in the representatives of things celestial, and not in celestial things themselves, and therefore they were not in charity, in mercy, in patience, or in any spiritual good, and hence were in the law of retaliation. For the heavenly law, and consequently the Christian law, which the Lord taught in the Evangelists, is:<p>"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; this is the law and the prophets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>).<p>Because this is the law in heaven, and from heaven in the church, therefore also every evil has with itself a corresponding punishment, called the punishment of evil, which is in the evil, as if conjoined with it. From this proceeds the punishment of retaliation, which was prescribed to the sons of Israel, because they were external and not internal men.<p>Internal men, as the angels of heaven are, do not desire to retaliate evil for evil, but from heavenly charity they forgive, for they know that the Lord defends against the evil all who are in good, that He defends according to the good which they possess, and that He would not defend, if, on account of the evil done to them, they were to be fired by enmity, hatred, and revenge, for these things turn protection aside. These, therefore, are the things involved in the above words of the Lord, but their signification shall be given in order.</p><p>[9] An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, signifies, that in the measure that one takes away from another the understanding of truth, and the sense of truth, in the same measure they are taken away from himself, the eye signifying the understanding of truth, and a tooth, the sense of truth, for the tooth denotes truth and falsity, as found in the sensual man. That he who is in Christian-good, will permit an evil person to take those things away as far as he can, is described in the reply which the Lord gives upon the same subject; the precept not to resist evil, signifies, that it is not to be resisted with violence, nor retaliated, for the angels do not fight with the evil, much less do they return evil for evil, but they permit them to do it, because they are defended by the Lord, and hence no evil from hell can possibly hurt them. But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also, signifies, that if any one shall desire to injure the perception and understanding of interior truth, it should be permitted so far as he makes the attempt, the cheek signifying the perception and understanding of interior truth, the right cheek the affection, and thence perception thereof, and the left, the understanding thereof, and because the cheek is mentioned, therefore also smiting is named, by which is meant to injure. For all things connected with the mouth, as the throat, the mouth itself, the lips, the cheek bones, the teeth, signify such things as pertain to the perception and understanding of truth, because they correspond to them, therefore they are used to express such things in the sense of the letter of the Word, which consists of pure correspondences. If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy robe also, signifies that, if any one desire to take away the interior truth in thee, that he shall be allowed also to take away exterior truth, the coat (tunica = chiton), signifying truth interior, and the robe (pallium = imation), truth exterior. This also the angels do when they are with the evil, for the evil cannot take away any thing of truth and good from the angels, but they can from those, who on that account burn with enmity, hatred and revenge, for these evils avert and reject the protection which is from the Lord. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain, signifies, if any one desire to lead away from truth to falsity, and from good to evil, that he shall not be opposed, because he is not able to accomplish it, a mile signifying the same as a way, namely, that which leads away and leads. Give to every one that asketh thee, signifies that it should be permitted; and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away, signifies, to instruct if any one desire to be instructed, for the evil desire this in order that they may pervert and deprive, which, however, they cannot do. This is the spiritual sense of the above words, wherein those things now explained lie deeply hidden, which are more especially for the angels, who perceive the Word only according to its spiritual sense; they are also for men in the world who are in good, when the evil try to seduce them. That the evil opposed to those whom the Lord defends are such, I have been permitted to know by much experience; for they have continually laboured with all their might, and in every possible way, to deprive me of truths and goods, but in vain.<p>From what has been stated, it may be in some degree evident that by a tooth is signified truth or falsity in the Sensual, which is the ultimate of the intellectual life of man. That this is signified by a tooth, is evident from the Lord's reply, where in the perception and understanding of truth are treated of, which the evil try to take away from the good.</p><p>[10] That teeth have this signification is further evident from the following passages; as in Jeremiah:<p>"In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten the wild grape, and the teeth of the sons are made blunt. But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man that eateth the wild grape, his teeth shall be made blunt" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_29.htm">31:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_30.htm">30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_4.htm">4</a>).<p>That this means that the sons and descendants shall not incur punishment for the evils of their parents, but every one for his own evil, is clear. By eating the wild grape is signified to appropriate to themselves the falsity of evil, for a wild grape, which is a bitter and bad grape, denotes the falsity of evil, and to eat, signifies to appropriate to oneself; and by the teeth being made blunt, is signified to be thence in the falsity of evil. For the teeth here, as above, signify falsities in ultimates, or in the sensual man, in which the evils of the parents, which are called hereditary, principally lie concealed with the children, and to be made blunt, signifies the appropriation of falsity from evil. For man is not punished on account of hereditary evils, but for his own, and if he causes hereditary evil to become actual evil in himself, wherefore it is said, "Every man shall die for his own iniquity; every man that eateth the wild grape, his teeth shall be made blunt."</p><p>[11] So in Job:<p>"All men abhor me; my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_19_19.htm">19:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_19_20.htm">20</a>).<p>These words, in the sense of the letter, mean, that he became both lank and lean; but the spiritual sense, signifies that temptations so suppressed the interiors of his mind, that he became sensual, and thought only in things most external, but still did not think falsities but truths; this is signified by escaping with the skin of his teeth, teeth without skin denoting falsities, but with skin, not falsities, because still in some degree clothed.</p><p>[12] So in Amos:<p>"I have given to you emptiness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_6.htm">4:6</a>).<p>By emptiness of teeth in cities, is denoted a scarcity of truth in doctrines; and by want of bread in [all] places, a scarcity of good from these in the life.</p><p> [13] So in Zechariah:<p>"I will take away her bloods out of her mouth, and her abominations from between her teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_7.htm">9:7</a>).<p>This is spoken concerning Tyre and Zidon, which signify the cognitions of truth and good, here, these falsified. By taking away bloods from the mouth is signified the falsifications of the cognitions of truth; and by abominations from between the teeth, are signified the adulterations of the cognitions of good; the cognitions of good are also truths, for to know good is from the understanding, and the understanding is of truth.</p><p>[14] So in David:<p>"The waters had overwhelmed us, the waters of the proud had gone over our soul. Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_124_4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_124_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_124_6.htm">6</a>).<p>By waters overwhelming, are signified the falsities which inundate, and, as it were, overwhelm man when he is in temptations; hence, it is said, "Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth," that is, to the hells which, by means of falsities, destroy truths, thus, to destroying falsities.</p><p>[15] Again, in Job:<p>"I brake the jaw teeth of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_29_17.htm">29:17</a>).<p>These words of Job are spoken concerning himself, and by his saying, "I brake the jaw teeth of the wicked," is signified that he fought against falsities, and conquered them, the jaw teeth of the wicked signifying scientifics from the sense of the letter of the Word, applied to confirm falsities by means of which truths are destroyed. His delivering others from falsities by instructing them, is signified by, I plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p><p>[16] Since the teeth signify falsities in things outermost, by gnashing of teeth is signified, to combat with vehemence and anger from falsities against truths, in the following passages.<p>Thus in Job:<p>"He teareth me in his wrath and hateth me; mine enemy gnasheth against me with his teeth; he sharpeneth his eyes against me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_16_9.htm">16:9</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"The lame whom I knew not are gathered together against me, they tear me, nor are they silent. They gnashed against me with their teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Again:<p>"The wicked plotteth evil against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_37_12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>).<p>Again:<p>"The wicked shall see, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_112_10.htm">Psalm 112:10</a>).<p>And in Micah:<p>"Against the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_3_5.htm">3:5</a>).<p>And in Lamentations:<p>"All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee," O daughter of Jerusalem; "they have hissed and gnashed with the tooth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_16.htm">2:16</a>).<p>And in Mark:<p>A certain one said to Jesus, "I have brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit; and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away; I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not." And Jesus said unto him, "Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_17.htm">9:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_25.htm">25</a>).<p>He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word, may suppose that it is said in the above passages that they gnashed their teeth, merely for the reason that they were angry and intended evil, because they then pressed their teeth together; but it is said that they gnashed their teeth because the endeavour to destroy and the act of destroying truths by means of falsities are meant; this is said in the Word because the teeth signify falsities in outermost things, and gnashing signifies eagerness in fighting on behalf of them. This effort and act are also from correspondence.</p><p>[17] Such also was the deaf and dumb spirit which the Lord cast out; for all spirits are from the human race, and this spirit was from that kind of men, who had fought eagerly for falsities against truths; for this reason he who was obsessed by him foamed, and gnashed with his teeth. He is called by the Lord deaf and dumb, because he did not wish to perceive and understand truth, for such are signified by the deaf and dumb. And being firm and obstinate against truths, and having confirmed himself in falsities, therefore that spirit could not be cast out by the disciples; for they could not dissipate the falsities for which he had fought, since they were not yet in the fitting state, therefore the disciples were on that account rebuked by the Lord. That this spirit was of such a nature, but not the one obsessed by him, is signified by the spirit tearing him, and by the obsessed pining away, and also by the fact that the Lord commanded the spirit to enter no more into him.</p><p>[18] From these considerations it is evident what is signified by gnashing of teeth, mentioned in <a href="../hh/575.htm">Heaven and Hell 575</a>).</p><p>[19] It is from this fact that the teeth of the evil correspond to falsities in the ultimates of their intellectual life, which are called corporeal sensual, that the spirits who are of such a nature appear deformed in the face, of which the teeth form a prominent part, standing out and extended like a grating in a kind of a gaping grin, and this because such grinning of teeth corresponds to the love and desire of fighting on behalf of falsities against truths.</p><p>[20] Teeth correspond to the ultimates of the intellectual life of man, which are called sensual, and these are in falsities of evil when they are separated from the truths of the interior understanding, which are called spiritual, but they correspond to truths of good in the Sensual when these are not separated, therefore, in the Word, they also signify ultimate truths, as in Job (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_19_19.htm">19:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_19_20.htm">20</a>); Amos (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_6.htm">4:6</a>), explained above.</p><p>[21] And because the Lord glorified His whole Human, that is, made it Divine, therefore it is said of Him, in Moses,<p>"Red in the eyes from wine, and white in the teeth from milk" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_12.htm">Genesis 49:12</a>).<p>By red in the eyes from wine, signifies that His Intellectual was Divine Truth from Divine Good; and by white in the teeth from milk, is signified that His Sensual similarly was Divine Truth from Divine Good; for by Shiloh in that chapter [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_5_10.htm">Genesis 5:10</a>] is meant the Lord.</p><p>[22] Because teeth correspond to the ultimates of the intellectual life, which are called sensual, therefore good spirits and angels have teeth equally as men, but with them they correspond to truths in the ultimate Sensual, for the Sensual with them is not separated from the truths of the interior understanding which are called spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 556</h4><p>556. And their teeth were as those of lions, signifies that sensual things, which are the ultimates of the intellectual life, seem to them to have power over all things. This is evident from the signification of "teeth," as being the sensual things which are the ultimates of the natural life in respect to the understanding (of which presently); and from the signification of "lions," as being the truths of the church in respect to power, but here falsities destroying truths, thus also these in respect to power (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/278.htm">278</a>). Here falsities are meant, because "locusts" signify the corporeal-sensual who are in the falsities of evil. These seem to themselves to have understanding, and thereby power over all things, because that persuasiveness which has been treated of above has its seat in the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural life; for this sensual, or the sensual man, is in self-confidence, and in the belief that he is wiser than all others, for he is unable to weigh and explore himself, because he does not think interiorly; and when he has persuaded himself of this, then such confidence and belief are in all things that he speaks. And because his speech takes its tone from these, it fascinates and infatuates the minds of others, for the tone of confidence and belief produces such an effect; and this is especially manifest in the spiritual world, where man speaks from his spirit; for the affection of self-confidence and of the consequent belief that a thing is so is in man's spirit, and a man's spirit speaks from his affection. In the natural world it is different. There man's spirit discourses by means of the body, and for the sake of the world brings forth such things as are not of the affection of his spirit, which he rarely exhibits, that its character may not be known. For this reason it is unknown in the world that there is such an infatuating and suffocating persuasiveness as exists in the spirit of the sensual man, who believes himself to be wiser than others. From this it can be seen why "their teeth were as those of lions" signifies that sensual men seem to themselves to have understanding, and thereby power over all things. That "teeth" signify sensual things, which are the ultimates of the natural life in respect to knowledge [scientia] can be seen from the correspondence of "teeth," as described in the work on Heaven and Hell (<a href="../hh/575.htm">n. 575</a>), and in the Arcana Coelestia (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5565.htm">n. 5565-5568</a>).</p><p>[2] That "teeth" have this signification can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In David:<p>My soul, I lie in the midst of lions; their teeth are spear and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalms 57:4</a>).<p>"Lions" signify those who by means of falsities destroy the truths of the church; "their teeth which are spear and arrows" signify the knowledges that are applied to confirm falsities and evils, and thus to destroy the truths and goods of the church; "their tongue a sharp sword" signifies crafty reasonings from falsities, which are called "a sharp sword" because a "sword" signifies falsity destroying truth.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>O God, break off their teeth in their mouth; remove <sup>1</sup>the jaw teeth of the young lions (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_58_6.htm">Psalms 58:6</a>).<p>"Teeth in their mouth" signify the knowledges from which they produce falsities; "the jaw teeth of the young lions," signify the truths of the Word falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and which are especially effective in destroying the truths of the church.</p><p>[4] In Joel:<p>A nation cometh up upon my land, vigorous and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it hath the jaw teeth of an immense lion. It maketh <sup>2</sup>my vine to a waste, and my fig tree to froth (<a href="../ae/403.htm">403</a>, where this is explained). The "teeth of lions" in these passages have a similar signification as "teeth as those of lions" here in Revelation. "Teeth" properly signify such things as are merely in the memory and are brought forth therefrom, for the things that are in the memory of the sensual man correspond to bones and teeth.</p><p>[5] In Daniel:<p>There came up out of the sea a second beast like to a bear; three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. After this there came up a fourth beast, dreadful, and terrible, and exceedingly strong, and it had great teeth of iron; it devoured and crushed, and trampled the remnant with its feet (<a href="../ae/316.htm">316</a>.)</p><p>[6] In Moses:<p>The tooth of beasts I will send upon them, with the poison of the creeping things of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>).<p>This evil, among others, was denounced upon the Israelitish and Jewish people if they did not keep and do the statutes and commandments; "the tooth of beasts" signifies falsities from evils of every kind, and "the poison of the creeping things of the earth" signifies the things that destroy and utterly extinguish spiritual life; "beasts" signify in the Word such things as belong to the natural man, and "the creeping things of the earth" the things belonging to the sensual man; both these when separated from the spiritual man are mere falsities from evils, because they are merely such things as belong to the body to which they adhere, and as belong to the world to which they stand nearest; and from the body and the world all thick darkness in spiritual things arises.</p><p>[7] In David:<p>Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God; for Thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheek; Thou breakest the teeth of the wicked (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_3_7.htm">Psalms 3:7</a>).<p>"To smite the enemies upon the cheek" signifies to destroy interior falsities with those who are opposed to the goods and truths of the church; such persons and their falsities of evil are meant in the Word by "enemies;" "to break the teeth of the wicked" signifies to destroy exterior falsities, which are such as are based on the fallacies of the senses and are confirmed by them.</p><p>[8] As the expressions in David, "to smite the cheek" and "to break the teeth" signify the destruction of interior and exterior falsities, it can be seen what is meant by "smiting on the cheek" in Matthew:<p>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also. And if any man wisheth to sue thee at the law and to take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also; and whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. Give to everyone that asketh thee, and from him that wisheth to borrow of thee turn not thou away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_38.htm">Matthew 5:38-42</a>).<p>That these words are not to be understood according to the letter is evident to everyone; for who is bound by Christian love to turn the left cheek to him who smites the right, or to give the cloak to him who would take away the coat? In a word, who is there to whom it is not allowable to resist evil? But as all things that the Lord said were in themselves Divine-celestial, it can be seen that these words, as well as the others which the Lord spoke, contain a heavenly sense. The sons of Israel had this law that they should give "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_23.htm">Exodus 21:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_24_20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_19_21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>), because they were external men, and thus were only in the representatives of heavenly things, and not in heavenly things themselves, thence not in charity, in mercy, in patience, nor in any spiritual good; consequently they were under the law of retaliation; for the heavenly law and thence the Christian law is that which the Lord taught in the Gospels:<p>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye to them; this is the Law and the Prophets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>).<p>Because this is the law in heaven, and from heaven in the church, therefore every evil carries with it a corresponding punishment, which is called the punishment of evil, and is in the evil as if joined with it; and from this springs the punishment of retaliation which was prescribed for the sons of Israel, because they were external and not internal men. Internal men, as the angels of heaven are, do not wish the retaliation of evil for evil, but from heavenly charity they forgive freely; for they know that the Lord protects from the evil all who are in good, and that He protects according to the good with them, and that He would not protect if on account of the evil done to them they should burn with enmity, hatred, and revenge, for these drive away protection.</p><p>[9] These things, therefore, are involved in what the Lord here said; but their signification shall be given in order: "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," signifies that so far as anyone takes away from another the understanding of truth and the sense of truth, so far are they taken away from him, the "eye" signifying the understanding of truth, and "tooth" the sense of truth, for a "tooth" means truth or falsity such as the sensual man has. That one who is in Christian good will permit an evil person to take these away as far as he can, is described by what the Lord says in reply on the same subject. "Resist not him that is in evil" signifies that there should be no fighting back of retaliation; for angels do not fight with the evil, much less do they return evil for evil, but they allow it to be done, since they are protected by the Lord, and therefore no evil from hell can do them harm. "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also" signifies if anyone wishes to do harm to the perception and understanding of interior truth, it may be allowed to the extent of the effort; "the cheek" signifies the perception and understanding of interior truth, the "right cheek" affection for it and consequent perception of it, and the "left cheek" understanding of it, and as the "cheek" is mentioned, so is "smiting," which means doing harm to; for all things pertaining to the mouth, as the throat, the mouth itself, the lips, the cheeks, the teeth, signify such things as belong to the perception and understanding of truth, because they correspond to them, therefore by these objects in the sense of the letter of the Word, which consists of pure correspondences, these things are expressed; "if any man wisheth to sue thee at the law and to take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also," signifies if anyone wishes to take away truth interiorly with thee, it may be allowed him to take away also exterior truth, "coat" signifying interior truth, and "cloak" exterior truth. This also is what angels do when they are with the evil, for the evil can take away nothing of good and truth from angels, but they can from those who on that account burn with enmity, hatred, and revenge, for these evils avert and repel protection by the Lord; "whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two," signifies whoever wishes to lead away from truth to falsity and from good to evil, since he cannot do it, may be left unopposed, a "mile" having a similar signification as a "way," namely, that which leads away or leads; "give to everyone that asketh thee" signifies that it is to be permitted; "and from him that wisheth to borrow of thee turn thou not away" signifies that if anyone wishes to be instructed he may be instructed, for the evil desire this that they may pervert and take away, and yet they cannot. This is the spiritual sense of these words, in which are stored up the hidden things that have now been said, which are especially for the angels; who perceive the Word only according to its spiritual sense; they are also for men in the world who are in good, when the evil are trying to lead them astray. That the opposition of the evil to those whom the Lord protects is such it has been granted me to know by much experience; for they have continually striven in every way and with all their might to take away from me truths and goods, but in vain. From what has been presented it can also in some degree be seen that a "tooth" signifies truth or falsity in the sensual, which is the ultimate of the intellectual life with man; that this is the signification of "tooth" is evident from the Lord's reply, in which the perception and understanding of truth are treated of, which the evil strive to take away from the good.</p><p>[10] That this is the signification of "teeth" can be seen further from the following passages. In Jeremiah:<p>In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge. But every man shall die in his own iniquity; every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_30.htm">30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_18_2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2-4</a>).<p>This involves evidently that the sons and descendants shall not incur punishment on account of the evils of parents, but everyone on account of his own evil; "to eat the sour grape" signifies to appropriate to oneself the falsity of evil, for a "sour grape," which is a bitter and bad grape, signifies the falsity of evil, and "to eat" signifies to appropriate to oneself; and "the teeth set on edge" signifies to be in the falsity of evil therefrom, for "teeth" here as above signify falsities in ultimates or in the sensual man, in which the evils of parents, which are called hereditary evils, especially lie hidden in children, and "to be set on edge" signifies the appropriation of falsity from evil; for a man is not punished on account of hereditary evils but on account of his own and so far as he makes hereditary evils actual in himself; therefore it is said that "everyone shall die in his own iniquity; and every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge."</p><p>[11] In Job:<p>All men abhor me; my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh; I have escaped with the skin of my teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_19_19.htm">Acts of the Apostles 19:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_19_20.htm">20</a>).<p>In the sense of the letter this means that he became thus lank and lean; but in the spiritual sense it signifies that temptations so suppressed the interiors of his mind that he became sensual, and thought only in things most external, and yet that he thought truths and not falsities; this is signified by "I have escaped with the skin of my teeth," "teeth" without skin signifying falsities, but with skin not falsities, since they are still in some degree clothed.</p><p>[12] In Amos:<p>I have given to you emptiness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_6.htm">Amos 4:6</a>).<p>"Emptiness of teeth in the cities" stands for a scarcity of truth in doctrines, and "want of bread in all places" for scarcity of good from doctrines in the life.</p><p> [13] In Zechariah:<p>I will take away his bloods out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a>).<p>This is said of Tyre and Sidon, which signify the knowledges of truth and good, here these falsified; "bloods out of the mouth" signify the falsifications of the knowledges of truths; and "the abominations from between the teeth" signify the adulterations of the knowledges of good; the knowledges of good are also truths, for to know goods is from the understanding, and the understanding is of truth.</p><p>[14] In David:<p>The waters had overwhelmed us, the presumptuous waters had passed over our soul. Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_124_4.htm">Psalms 124:4-6</a>).<p>The "waters that had overwhelmed" signify falsities that flow in, and as it were overwhelm man when he is in temptations; therefore it is said, "Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth," that is, to the hells that destroy truths by falsities, thus to destructive falsities.</p><p>[15] In Job:<p>I brake the jaw teeth of the wicked, and plucked the prey out of his teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_29_17.htm">Job 29:17</a>).<p>This Job says of himself. "I brake the jaw teeth of the wicked" signifies that he fought against falsities and conquered them, "jaw teeth" signifying knowledges [scientifica] from the sense of the letter of the Word, adapted to confirm the falsities by which truths are destroyed; and "I plucked the prey out of his teeth" signifies that he delivered others from falsities by instructing them.</p><p>[16] Because the "teeth" signify falsities in things most external, "gnashing of teeth" signifies to fight with vehemence and anger from falsities against truths, in the following passages. In Job:<p>He teareth me in his wrath, and hateth me; mine enemy gnasheth upon me with his teeth, he sharpeneth his eyes against me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_16_9.htm">Job 16:9</a>).<p>In David:<p>The halt whom I know not gather themselves together against me, they rend, nor are they silent. They gnash upon me with their teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_15.htm">Psalms 35:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_16.htm">16</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_37_12.htm">Psalms 37:12</a>).<p>In the same:<p>The wicked shall see and be provoked; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt <sup>3</sup>away (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_112_10.htm">Psalms 112:10</a>).<p>In Micah:<p>Against the prophets that lead the people astray, that bite with their teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_3_5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>).<p>In Lamentations:<p>All thine enemies opened their mouth against thee, O daughter of Jerusalem, they hissed and gnashed the teeth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_16.htm">Lamentations 2:16</a>).<p>In Mark:<p>One said to Jesus, I have brought unto thee my son, who hath an evil <sup>4</sup>spirit; and wheresoever it taketh him it teareth him; and he foameth and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away; and I spake to Thy disciples that they should cast it out, but they were not able. And Jesus said unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee come out of him, and enter no more into him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_17.htm">Mark 9:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_25.htm">25</a>).<p>One who is ignorant of the spiritual sense of the Word might suppose that they are said "to gnash the teeth" merely because they were angry and intent on evil, since men then press the teeth together; but they are said "to gnash the teeth" because the endeavor to destroy and the act of destroying truths by means of falsities are meant by it; this is said in the Word because "teeth" signify falsities in things most external, and "gnashing" signifies vehemence in fighting for them; this effort and act are also from correspondence.</p><p>[17] Moreover, such was the deaf and dumb spirit that the Lord cast out; for all spirits are from the human race; this spirit was from that kind of men who had vehemently fought for falsities against truths; consequently the one obsessed by him "foamed and gnashed his teeth." He is called by the Lord "deaf and dumb" because he was unwilling to perceive and understand the truth, for such are signified by "the deaf and the dumb." And because this spirit was determined and obstinate against truths, and had confirmed himself in falsities, the disciples were not able to cast him out, for the falsities for which he had fought they were not yet able to dispel because they had not yet reached the proper state, and it was for this also that the disciples were rebuked by the Lord. That this spirit was such, and the one obsessed by him was not such, is signified by "the spirit tearing him," and the obsessed "pining away;" and the Lord's commanding the spirit "to enter no more into him."</p><p>[18] All this makes clear what is signified by:<p>Gnashing of teeth (<a href="../hh/575.htm">Heaven and Hell 575</a>.)</p><p>[19] Because with the evil the teeth correspond to the falsities they have in the ultimates of their intellectual life, which are called corporeal-sensual, therefore the spirits who are such appear deformed in the face, the greater part of which is made up of the teeth standing widely apart like gratings, and in a broad grin, and this because such gaping of teeth corresponds to the love and eagerness for fighting for falsities against truths.</p><p>[20] Because the teeth correspond to the ultimates of man's intellectual life, which are called sensual, and these when separated from the truths of the interior understanding, which are called spiritual, are in the falsities of evil, but the same when not separated correspond to the truths of good in the sensual, so "teeth" in the Word signify also ultimate truths (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_19_19.htm">Job 19:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_19_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_4_6.htm">Amos 4:6</a>, which may be seen explained above).</p><p>[21] And because the Lord glorified His entire Human, that is, made it Divine, therefore it is said of Him in Moses:<p>His eyes shall be red with wine, and His teeth white with milk (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_12.htm">Genesis 49:12</a>).<p>"Eyes red with wine" signifies that His intellectual was Divine truth from Divine good; and "teeth white with milk" signifies that His sensual was likewise Divine truth from Divine good; for "Shiloh" here (verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>) means the Lord.</p><p>[22] Because "teeth" correspond to the ultimates of the intellectual life, which are called sensual, good spirits and angels have teeth the same as men, but with them the teeth correspond to truths in the ultimate sensual, for with them the sensual is not separated from the truths of the interior understanding which are called spiritual.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Latin has "remove," the Hebrew "tear out."<br><br>2.&nbsp;Latin has "maketh," the Hebrew "made," as also found in <a href="../ae/403.htm">AE 403</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5113.htm">AC 5113</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9052.htm">9052</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;Latin has "melteth," Hebrew "shall melt."<br><br>4.&nbsp;Latin has "evil," Greek "mute," as in <a href="../ae/815.htm">AE 815</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 556 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>556. "Et dentes illarum sicut leonum erant." - Quod significet quod sensualia quae sunt ultima vitae intellectualis sint illis apparenter sicut in potentia super omnia, constat ex significatione "dentium", quod sint sensualia, quae sunt ultima vitae naturalis quoad intellectum (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "leonum", quod sint vera ecclesiae quoad potentiam, hic autem falSa destruentia vera, ita quoque quoad potentiam (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_278" target=_top>278</a>); quod hic sint falsa, est quia per "locustas" significantur senSuales corporei qui in falsis mali sunt. Quod appareant sibi in intellectu et inde in potentia super omnia, est quia ipsum persuasivum, de quo supra actum est, residet in sensuali quod est ultimum vitae naturalis; hoc enim, seu homo sensualis, est in confidentia sui et in fide quod prae omnibus sapiat, non enim expendere et explorare se potest, quia non interius cogitat; et cum id sibi persuadet, tunc in omnibus quae loquitur est illa confidentia et fides. Inde loquela, quia ex illis sonat, fascinat et infatuat mentes aliorum; sonus enim confidentiae et fidei talem effectum edit, quod imprimis se manifestat in mundo spirituali, ubi homo ex spiritu suo loquitur; nam affectio confidentiae sui, et inde fidei quod ita sit, est in spiritu hominis, et spiritus hominis ex affectione loquitur: aliter in mundo naturali; in hoc spiritus hominis per corpus sermocinatur, et propter mundum producit talia quae non affectionis ejus spiritus sunt, quae raro propalat, ne sciatur qualis est: inde quoque est quod in mundo nesciatur quod detur persuasivum infatuans et suffocans, quale inest spiritui sensualis hominis, qui credit se prae aliis sapere. Ex his constare potest unde est quod per "dentes illarum sicut leonum" significetur quod sensuales homines appareant sibi sicut in intellectu et inde potentia esse super omnia. <p>Quod "dentes" significent sensualia quae sunt ultima vitae naturalis quoad scientiam, constare potest ex correspondentia dentium (de qua in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_575" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 575</a>; et in Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5565" target=_top>5565-5568</a>).<p>[2] Quod "dentes" illa significent constare potest ex sequentibus locis in Verbo:<p>- Apud Davidem,<p>"Anima mea in medio leonum cubo dentes eorum hasta et tela, et lingua eorum gladius acutus" (Psalms 57:5 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_57_4" target=_top>4</a>]):<p>per "leones" significantur qui per falsa destruunt vera ecclesiae; "dentes eorum" quae "hasta et tela", significant scientifica quae applicant ad confirmandum falsa et mala, et sic ad destruendum vera et bona ecclesiae; "lingua eorum gladius acutus" significat astuta ratiocinia ex falsis, quae vocantur "gladius acutus" quia "gladius significat falsum destruens verum.<p>[3] Apud eundem,<p>"Deus, destrue dentes eorum in ore eorum; molares leonum juvenum <sup>1</sup></p><p>averte" (Psalms 58:7 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_58_6" target=_top>6</a>]):<p>"dentes in ore eorum" significant scientifica ex quibus falsa producunt; "molares leonum juvenum" significant vera Verbi falsificata, quae in se sunt falsa, per quae maxime destruere valent vera ecclesiae.<p>[4] Apud Joelem,<p>"Gens ascendit super terram meam, robusta ei non numerus; dentes ejus dentes leonis, et molares leonis immanis illi; <sup>2</sup></p><p>redigit vitem meam in vastitatem, et ficum meam in spumam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_1_6" target=_top>1:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_556/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_1_7" target=_top>7</a>):<p>per "gentem" quae "ascendit super terram" significatur malum devastans ecclesiam ("gens" est malum, et "terra" est ecclesia); "robusta et non numerus" significat potens et multiplex ("robustum" praedicatur de potentia mali, et "non numerus " de potentia falsi); "dentes ejus dentes leonis" significant falsa destruentia; "molares leonis immanis" significant falsificata; " <sup>3</sup></p><p>redigit vitem in vastitatem, et ficum in spumam", significat destruens vera spiritualia et naturalia; vera spiritualia sunt illa quae sunt sensus spiritualis Verbi, et vera naturalia quae sunt sensus litterae ejus.

Per "dentes leonum" in his locis similia significantur quae per "dentes sicut leonum" hic in Apocalypsi.

Interni homines, ut sunt angeli caeli, non volunt retributionem mali pro malo, sed ex charitate caelesti condonant: sciunt enim quod Dominus tutetur omnes qui in bono sunt contra malos et quod tutetur secundum bonum apud illos; et quod non tutaretur, si, ex malo quod sibi faciunt, accenderentur inimicitia, odio et vindicta, haec enim avertunt tutelam.<p>[9] Haec itaque sunt quae involvunt illa quae Dominus dixit; quid autem significant, ordine dicetur. "Oculus pro oculo, et dens pro dente", significat quantum aliquis alteri aufert intellectum veri et sensum veri, tantum illi auferrentur; per "oculum" significatur intellectus veri, et per "dentem" sensus veri, nam "dens" significat verum et falsum quale est sensuali homini; quod ille qui in bono Christiano est, permittet ut malus illa auferat quantum potest, describitur per illa quae Dominus de eadem re respondit: "non resistendum esse malo" significat non repugnandum nec retribuendum illi; angeli enim non pugnant cum malis, minus retribuunt malum pro malo; sed permittunt ut faciant, quia tuti sunt a Domino, et inde non aliquod malum ab inferno illis damnum potest inferre: "quicunque tibi impegerit alapam in dextram tuam maxillam, obverte illi etiam alteram", significat, si quis damnum inferre vult perceptioni et intellectui veri interioris, ut permittatur quantum tentat; per "maxillam" significatur perceptio et intellectus veri interioris; per "maxillam dextram" affectio et inde perceptio ejus, et per "maxillam sinistram" intellectus ejus; et quia dicitur "maxilla", ideo etiam dicitur "alapam infligere", per quod intelligitur damnum inferre; omnia enim quae oris sunt, prout guttur, os, labia, maxillae, dentes, significant talia quae perceptionis et intellectus veri sunt, quia illis correspondent; quare per illa in sensu litterae Verbi, qui ex meris correspondentiis consistit, exprimuntur: "si quis velit te in jus trahere, et tunicam auferre, permitte etiam pallium", significat si quis auferre vult verum interius quod apud te, ut liceat etiam auferre verum exterius; "tunica" significat verum interius, et "pallium" verum exterius; hoc quoque faciunt angeli quando apud malos sunt, mali enim nihil veri et boni possunt angelis auferre, sed possunt illis qui propterea flagrant inimicitia, odio et vindicta, nam haec mala avertunt et rejiciunt tutationem a Domino: "quisquis te adegerit ad milliare unum, abito cum illo duo", significat qui vult abducere a vero ad falsum et a bono ad malum, ut non obstet, quia non potest; per "milliare" simile significatur quod per "viam", nempe id quod abducit et ducit: "omni a te petenti, dato" significat ut permittatur: "et cupienti mutuum accipere a te, ne averseris", significat si desiderat instrui, ut instruat; nam mali hoc desiderant ut pervertant et deprivent, sed usque non possunt. Hic est sensus spiritualis illorum verborum, in quibus recondita latent quae nunc dicta sunt, quae imprimis sunt pro angelis, qui Verbum modo secundum sensum ejus spiritualem percipiunt; sunt etiam pro hominibus in mundo qui in bono sunt, quando mali illos tentant seducere. Quod tales sint mali contra illos quos Dominus tutatur, ex pluri experientia scire datum est; continuo enim ac omni modo et nisu allaborarunt me deprivare veris et bonis, sed incassum. Ex allatis etiam aliquantum constare potest quod per "dentem" significetur verum aut falsum in sensuali, quod est ultimum vitae intellectualis apud hominem; quod id per "dentem" significetur, patet a responso Domini, in quo agitur de perceptione et intellectu veri, quae mali intentant bonis auferre.</p><p>[10] Quod per "dentes" illa significentur, adhuc constare potest a sequentibus:<p>- Apud Jeremiam,<p>"In diebus illis non dicent amplius, Patres comederunt labruscam, ac dentes filiorum hebetati sunt: sed quisque in iniquitate sua morietur;
