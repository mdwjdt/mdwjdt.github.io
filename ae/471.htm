<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 471</h4><p>471. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me.- That this signifies influx out of heaven from the Lord, and thence perception, is evident from the signification of answering and saying, when stated of the elders, who signify heaven where the Lord is, as denoting influx and perception, for "to answer" denotes influx, and "to say," perception; and from the signification of the elders, as denoting those who are in the second, or middle heaven, where those are who are in intelligence, and through whom responses are given; concerning this see above (n. <a href="../ae/462.htm">462</a>). And because all influx is from the Lord alone, although by means of angels, therefore these words signify influx and perception out of heaven from the Lord. That such a sense is contained in these words may seem strange; still, these words are in no other way understood in heaven. It appears strange, for the reason that this is as it were a historical statement, and matters of history conceal the spiritual sense more than those that are only prophetical; but all the historical parts of the Word contain also a spiritual sense, and still more the prophetical histories, which consist of those things which the prophets saw, and of those that were said to them when they were in the vision of the spirit; for all those things are representative and significative. For example that four-and-twenty elders and four animals were seen by John, is prophetical history, representing and signifying the angels of the higher heavens, as shown above. It follows therefore, that the speaking of one of the elders to him was also significative; for it signifies influx and perception out of heaven from the Lord.</p><p>[2] That answering does not here signify to answer in its ordinary meaning, is evident from this fact, that it is said without interrogation, and to answer, implies interrogation; here therefore it has reference to thought concerning those who were seen in white robes.<p>Moreover the expression "to answer," often occurs in the Word, and, when used in reference to the Lord, it signifies influx, inspiration, perception, and information, also mercy, and help; as in the following passages:<p>"In a time of good pleasure have I answered thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>).<p>In David:<p>"Save me, O Jehovah; let the king answer us in the day when we call" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_20_9.htm">Psalm 20:9</a>).<p>Again:<p>"Answer me when I call, O God of my justice" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_4_1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>).<p>Again:<p>"Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_13_3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>).<p>"I call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me O God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_17_6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a>).<p>Again:<p>"I sought Jehovah, and he answered me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_34_4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>).<p>Again:<p>"He calleth upon me, and I will answer him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a>).<p>And again:<p>"In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, and he answered me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_120_1.htm">120:1</a>, and elsewhere).<p>In these and in other passages, by answering is not meant, to answer, but to flow into the thought, to cause to perceive, and also to give help from mercy. Answers, therefore, that are said to come from the Lord, signify perceptions from influx. It is to be observed, that whatever comes into perception from the Lord is called influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 471</h4><p>471. Verse 13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, signifies influx out of heaven from the Lord, and perception therefrom. This is evident from the signification of "answering and saying," when predicated of the "elders," who signify heaven where the Lord is, as being influx and perception, "to answer" meaning influx, and "to say" perception; also from the signification of the "elders," as being those who are in the second or middle heaven, where those are who are in intelligence, and through whom answers come (of which above, n. <a href="../ae/462.htm">462</a>; and because all influx is from the Lord alone, although through the angels, these words signify influx and perception out of heaven from the Lord. That there is such a meaning in these words may seem strange; but in no other way are these words perceived in heaven. This seems strange because this is said as if it were historical, and historical things conceal the spiritual sense more than those purely prophetical; but all the historical parts of the Word also contain a spiritual meaning, and still more those that are historical-prophetical, which are such as appeared to and were said to the prophets when they were in the vision of the spirit; for all such things are representative and significative; as for instance, "the four and twenty elders" and "four animals" seen by John; this is historical-prophetical, representing and signifying the angels of the higher heavens, as has been shown above; so it follows that "one of the elders speaking to him" was likewise significative, signifying influx and perception out of heaven from the Lord.</p><p>[2] "He answered" does not signify here to answer in the ordinary sense, as can be seen from its being said when there is no question, for to answer implies a question; so here it has reference to thought respecting those who were seen in white robes. Moreover, the expression "to answer" frequently occurs in the Word, and it signifies, in reference to the Lord, influx, inspiration, perception, and information, likewise mercy and aid, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>In the time of My good pleasure have I answered thee, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>).<p>In David:<p>Save me, O Jehovah; let the king answer us in the day when we call (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_20_9.htm">Psalms 20:9</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Answer me when I shall call, O God of my righteousness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_4_1.htm">Psalms 4:1</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Look, answer me, O Jehovah, my God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_13_3.htm">Psalms 13:3</a>).<p>In the same:<p>I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_17_6.htm">Psalms 17:6</a>).<p>In the same:<p>I sought Jehovah and He answered me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_34_4.htm">Psalms 34:4</a>).<p>In the same:<p>He calleth <sup>1</sup>upon Me and I will answer him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_91_15.htm">Psalms 91:15</a>).<p>In the same:<p>In my distress I cried out unto Jehovah, and He answered me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_120_1.htm">Psalms 120:1</a>);<p>and elsewhere. In these and other passages, "to answer" means not to answer but to flow into the thought, to give perception, and to give help from compassion; from this it is that "answers," in reference to the Lord, signify perceptions from influx. It is to be noted that whatever comes from the Lord into the perception is called influx.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "call thou," the Hebrew "he calleth." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 471 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>471. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_7_13" target=_top>13</a>.] "Et respondit unus ex senioribus, dicens mihi." - Quod significet influxum e caelo a Domino, et inde perceptionem, constat ex significatione "respondere" et "dicere", cum ex senioribus, per quos significatur caelum ubi Dominus, quod sit influxus et perceptio, "respondere" influxus, et "dicere" perceptio; et ex significatione "seniorum", quod sint qui in secundo seu medio caelo, ubi sunt qui in intelligentia, et per quos fiunt responsa (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_462" target=_top>462</a>): et quia omnis influxus est a solo Domino, tametsi per angelos, per illa verba significatur influxus et perceptio e caelo a Domino. Quod is sensus illis verbis insit, apparet alienum; at usque non aliter percipiuntur illa verba in caelo: quod appareat alienum, est quia dicitur hoc sicut historicum, et historica occultant magis sensum spiritualem quam mere prophetica; verum omnia historica Verbi etiam sensum spiritualem continent; inde magis adhuc historica prophetica, quae sunt quae apparuerunt et quae dicta sunt prophetis cum fuerunt in visione spiritus, nam ea omnia repraesentativa et significativa sunt; ut quod visi fuerint Johanni "viginti et quatuor seniores", et "quatuor animalia", hoc historicum propheticum est, ac repraesentabat et significabat angelos superiorum caelorum, ut supra ostensum est; inde sequitur quod similiter significativum fuerit quod "unus ex senioribus locutus sit ad illum"; significat enim influxum et perceptionem e caelo a Domino.<p>[2] Quod "respondit" hic non significet respondere in vulgari sensu, patere potest ex eo quod dicatur absque interrogatione, et respondere est ad interrogationem; hic itaque ad cogitationem de illis qui visi sunt in stolis albis. Praeterea in Verbo saepius dicitur "respondere", et id, cum de Domino, significat influxum, inspirationem, perceptionem, et informationem, tum etiam misericordiam et opem, ut in sequentibus locis:<p>- Apud Esaiam,<p>"In tempore beneplaciti respondi tibi, et in die salutis adjuvi te" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_8" target=_top>49:8</a>);<p>apud Davidem,<p>"Jehovah, salva me, Rex respondeat nobis in die quo invocamus" (Psalms 20:10 [B.A. Psalms 20bbccc[9]);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Quum clamavero responde Mihi, Deus justitiae meae" (Psalms 4:2 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_4_1" target=_top>1</a>]);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Respice, responde mihi, Jehovah Deus mi" (Psalms 13:4 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_13_3" target=_top>3</a>]);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Ego invoco Te, quia respondes mihi, Deus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_17_6" target=_top>Psalms 17:6</a>);<p>apud eundem<p>"Quaesivi Jehovam, et respondit mihi" (Psalms 34:5 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_34_4" target=_top>4</a>]);<p>apud eundem,<p>" <sup>1</sup></p><p>Invocat Me, et respondebo illi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_91_15" target=_top>Psalms 91:15</a>):<p>apud eundem,<p>"Ad Jehovam, cum angustia mihi, clamavi, qui respondit mihi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_120_1" target=_top>Psalms 120:1</a>):<p>et alibi. In his et aliis locis per "respondere" non intelligitur respondere, sed influere in cogitationem, dare percipere, et quoque ferre opem ex misericordia: inde est quod responsa, quae dicuntur de Domino, significent perceptiones ex influxu. Sciendum est quod quicquid in perceptionem a Domino venit, dicatur influxus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
