<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1044</h4><p>1044. And pearls. That this signifies the appearance in externals as if they were in the knowledges of good and truth, although, in internals, they are in the knowledge of evil and falsity, is evident from the signification of pearls, as denoting the knowledges of good and truth, of which we shall speak presently. Hence, in the opposite sense, by pearls is signified the knowledge of evil and falsity, whence came their craftiness and malice.<p>That the Babylonian nation is such, namely, that they are desirous to appear holy, and thence to possess all good and truth, and the knowledges thereof, consequently, to be intelligent above all others in the world, although they have neither the good nor the truth, nor the knowledges thereof, and thence have no intelligence and wisdom in spiritual things. That they have not these, indeed, that they are insane as to these things, is plainly seen in the spiritual world, where the interiors of every man are opened and thence made manifest. These in the case of the monks, and even the Jesuits, who were reputed to be more intelligent than others, appeared so empty and void, that they did not know even a single truth that leads to heaven. They have been examined, and were found to be such.</p><p>[2] The reason why they appear in externals to be in goods, in true knowledges, intelligence and wisdom is, that they have subjected to their dominion all the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship; and because they consequently speak from authority with the common people, persuading them that the mysteries of heaven are in their hands, and that their Pope utters his edicts from inspiration just as the Prophets and Apostles did. And this, also, they can declare in a haughty manner, because they speak from the authority of dominion over souls, and over heaven and hell. And this also is believed by the common people from a belief in the sanctity of their instructors, without repugnance of heart, since they are kept, for that end, in gross darkness about spiritual things; in this darkness they impart to them spurious goods, and unmeaning truths, which they call Divine and heavenly. Indeed, so great is the darkness in which the common people are kept, that they are able to breathe into them diabolical and infernal evils and falsities, and cause such to believe them to be celestial and spiritual goods and truths. For in this and no other way could they be worshipped as deities, and subject the earth and the possessions thereof to their rule and disposal. Such are the things that lie concealed inwardly in them, while outwardly they appear to be clothed in crimson and scarlet, and decked with gold, precious stone, and pearls.</p><p>[3] That pearls signify the knowledges of good and truth, is evident from the following passages. In Matthew:<p>"The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchantman seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_45.htm">13:45</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_46.htm">46</a>).<p>By the kingdom of the heavens is meant both heaven and the church. By the merchant-man are meant those who procure to themselves the goods and truths, by which heaven and the church [may be attained]. By pearls are signified the knowledges of good and truth; for these are the truths of the natural man. By one precious pearl is meant knowledge concerning the Lord and concerning His Divine. And by his going and selling all that he had, and buying it, is signified that he put away the proprium in order to receive life from the Lord.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample on them with their feet, and turn again and rend you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_6.htm">7:6</a>).<p>By dogs are signified lusts and appetites. By swine are signified filthy loves, such as are those in the hells of adulterers. These being in the infernal marriage, which is that of falsity and evil, altogether reject goods and truths, and the knowledges thereof, and, moreover, treat them with ignominy and contempt. Therefore it is said, "Cast not your pearls before swine, lest they trample on them with their feet, and turn and rend you." To trample with the feet, denotes to reject altogether as dirt; and to turn and rend, denotes to treat with ignominy and contempt.</p><p>[5] By pearls are signified the knowledges of good and truth also in the following passages in the Apocalypse:<p>"The merchants of the earth shall weep and wail over Babylon, that no one buyeth their merchandise any more; merchandise of gold and silver, and of precious stones and pearls" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_11.htm">18:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_12.htm">12</a>).<p>Also:<p>"The twelve gates" of the wall of the New Jerusalem were "twelve pearls; each gate was one pearl" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_21.htm">21:21</a>).<p>Because by the gates for the New Jerusalem are signified those things pertaining to doctrine from the Word that introduce a man into the church, and these are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, therefore the gates were seen to be of pearls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1044</h4><p>1044. And pearls, signifies their appearance in externals to be in the cognitions [cognitiones] of good and truth, and yet in internals they are in the knowledge [scientia] of evil and falsity. This is evident from the signification of "pearls," as being the cognitions of good and truth (of which presently); therefore in the contrary sense "pearls" signify the knowledges of evil and falsity, which are the source of their craft and cunning. That the Babylonian nation is such, namely, that they wish to appear to be in sanctity, and thus in every good and truth and in the knowledges of these, and to appear in consequence to be intelligent above all others in the world, although in fact they are in no good or truth nor in any knowledges of these, and thus not in any intelligence or wisdom in spiritual things. That they are not in these, but are instead insane in respect to them, is clearly seen in the spiritual world, where the interiors of every man are laid bare and thus clearly appear. In the case of the monks, and especially the Jesuits, who from their cleverness were considered to be more intelligent than all others in the world, their interiors were found to be so empty and void that they did not know a single truth that leads to heaven. These have been explored, and have been found to be such.</p><p>[2] They appear in externals to be in goods, truths, knowledges, intelligence, and wisdom, because they have made subject to their dominion all the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, and therefore from dominion they speak with the common people, persuading them that they hold the mysteries of heaven, and that their Pope utters his edicts from inspiration, like that of the prophets and apostles; and this they can declare in a haughty manner, because they speak from the authority of dominion over souls, and over heaven and hell; and from a persuasion of their holiness it can be accepted by the common people with no repugnance of heart, since the common people are kept for this very purpose in dense thick darkness respecting spiritual things. And in that thick darkness they inspire spurious goods and foolish truths, which they call Divine and heavenly; and in such thick darkness in which the common people are kept, they are even able to inspire devilish and infernal evils and falsities, and to induce a faith in them as if they were celestial and spiritual goods and truths; for thus and not otherwise can they be adored as deities, and subject countries and possessions to their command and disposal. Such are the things that lie hidden inwardly in them, while outwardly they appear as if "arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold, precious stones, and pearls."</p><p>[3] That "pearls" signify the knowledges of good and truth can be seen from the following passages. In Matthew:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, going away sold all that he had and bought it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>).<p>"The kingdom of the heavens" means both heaven and the church; the "merchant" means those who acquire for themselves the goods and truths through which heaven and the church come; "pearls" signify the knowledges of good and truth, for these are the truths of the natural man; "the one precious pearl" means the knowledge respecting the Lord and His Divine; "going away he sold all that he had and bought it" signifies to reject what is one's own [proprium] in order to receive life from the Lord.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest they trample on them with their feet, and turn and rend you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>).<p>"Dogs" signify lusts and appetites; "swine" signify filthy loves, such as are those in the hells of adulterers. Because such are in the infernal marriage, which is the marriage of falsity and evil, they utterly reject goods and truths and the knowledges of these, and moreover treat them with scorn and scoffing; therefore it is said, "Cast not your pearls before the swine, lest they trample on them with their feet, and turn and rend you," "to trample with the feet" being to wholly reject as filth, and "to turn and rend" being to treat with scorn and scoffing.</p><p>[5] "Pearls" also signify the knowledges of good and truth in the following passages in Revelation:<p>The merchants of the earth shall weep and wail over Babylon, for no one buyeth their merchandise any more, merchandise of gold and silver, and of precious stone and pearl (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_11.htm">Revelation 18:11-12</a>).<p>Again:<p>The twelve gates of the wall of the New Jerusalem were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was one pearl (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<p>As "the gates to the New Jerusalem" signify such things of doctrine from the Word as introduce man into the church, and these are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, so the gates were seen to be "of pearls." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1044 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1044. "Et margaritis." - Quod significet apparentiam in externis sicut forent in cognitionibus boni et veri, cum tamen in internis sunt in scientia mali et falsi, constat ex significatione "margaritarum", quod sint cognitiones boni et veri (de qua sequitur); inde in opposito sensu per "margaritas" significatur scientia mali et falsi, ex qua illis est astutia et malitia. Quod gens Babylonica talis sit, nempe quod velint apparere in sancto, et inde sicut in omni bono et vero, inque cognitionibus illorum, proinde in intelligentia prae omnibus in mundo, cum tamen potius sunt in nullo bono et vero, nec in cognitionibus illorum, et inde non in aliqua intelligentia et sapientia in spiritualibus, – quod in illis non sint, immo quod insaniant in illis, – manifeste videtur in mundo spirituali, ubi interiora cujusvis hominis aperiuntur et inde patent; quae apud monachos, immo apud Jesuitas, qui intelligentes ex ingenio prae reliquis in mundo reputati sunt, tam vacua et inania apparuerunt ut ne quidem unum verum quod ducit ad caelum sciverint; explorati sunt, et visi tales.<p>[2] Quod in externis appareant quod in bonis, veris, cognitionibus, intelligentia et sapientia sint, est quia dominio suo subjecerunt omnia sancta Verbi, ecclesiae et cultus, et quia inde ex dominio loquuntur cum vulgo, persuadendo quod arcana caeli apud illos sint, et quod eorum Papa ex inspiratione, aeque ac Prophetae et Apostoli, enuntiata edat; et quoque hoc fastuose ab illis dici potest, quia ex auctoritate dominii super animas, superque caelum et infernum loquuntur, et quoque a vulgo credi potest ex persuasione sanctitatis illorum, absque repugnantia cordis, quoniam vulgus ob illum finem in densa caligine de rebus spiritualibus tenetur; in qua caligine inspirant bona spuria, et vera fatua, quae vocant Divina et caelestia; immo in tali caligine, in qua vulgus tenetur, inspirare possunt mala et falsa diabolica et infernalia, ac inducere fidem sicut forent bona et vera caelestia et spiritualia; sic enim et non aliter possunt adorari sicut numina, ac suo imperio et suae ditioni subjicere terras et possessiones: haec namque apud illos interius latent, dum exterius apparent sicut induti purpura et coccino, ac inaurati auro, lapide pretioso et margaritis.<p>[3] Quod "margaritae" significent cognitiones boni et veri, constat ex sequentibus:<p>– Apud Matthaeum,<p>"Simile est regnum caelorum negotiatori quaerenti pulchras margaritas, qui cum invenisset unam pretiosam margaritam, abiens vendidit omnia quae habuit, et emit illam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1044/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_45" target=_top>13:45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1044/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_46" target=_top>46</a>):<p>per "regnum caelorum" intelligitur et caelum et ecclesia; per "negotiatorem" intelliguntur qui comparant sibi bona et vera, per quae caelum et ecclesia; per "margaritas" significantur cognitiones boni et veri, sunt enim hae vera naturalis hominis; per "unam margaritam pretiosam" intelligitur cognitio de Domino, et de Ipsius Divino; quod "abiens vendiderit omnia quae habuit, et emerit illam", significat quod proprium rejiceret, ut vitam a Domino acciperet.<p>[4] Apud eundem,<p>"Non detis quod sanctum est canibus, ne projicite margaritas vestras ante porcos, ne forte conculcent eas pedibus, et versi lacerent vos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1044/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_6" target=_top>7:6</a>):<p>per "canes" significantur concupiscentiae et appetitus: per "porcos" sIgnificantur spurci amores, quales in infernis adulterorum sunt; hi quia in conjugio infernali, quod est falsi et mali, sunt, ideo vera et bona ac illorum cognitiones prorsus rejiciunt, ac insuper ignominia et contumeliis afficiunt; ideo dicitur, "Ne projicite margaritas vestras ante porcos, ne forte conculcent eas pedibus suis, et versi lacerent vos"; "conculcare pedibus" est prorsus rejicere sicut caenum, ac "versi lacerare" est ignominia et contumeliis afficere.<p>[5] Per "margaritas" significantur cognitiones boni et veri etiam in sequentibus in Apocalypsi,<p>"Mercatores terrae flebunt et plangent super" Babylone, "quod merces eorum nemo emat amplius, merces auri et argenti, et lapidis pretiosi, et margaritae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1044/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_11" target=_top>18:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1044/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_12" target=_top>12</a>):<p>Tum "duodecim portae" muri Novae Hierosolymae", duodecim margaritae, unaquaeque portarum erat margarita una" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1044/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_21" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:21</a>);<p>quoniam per "portas ad Novam Hierosolymam" significantur talia doctrinae ex Verbo quae introducunt hominem in ecclesiam, et illa sunt cognitiones veri et boni ex Verbo, ideo portae visae sunt "ex margaritis." </p>
