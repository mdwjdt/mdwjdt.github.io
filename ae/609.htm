<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 609</h4><p>609. Who created heaven, and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the sea, and the things that are therein.- That this signifies the Lord as to all things, interior and exterior, of heaven and the church, is evident from the signification of creating, as denoting not only to cause a thing to be, but also to give it perpetual existence, by holding it together and sustaining it by the proceeding Divine; for the heavens have existed, and do perpetually exist, that is subsist, by the Divine of the Lord, which is called the Divine Truth united to Divine Good, and this received by the angels makes heaven; for this reason when heaven is mentioned, the Lord is meant, because heaven, where the angels are, is heaven from the Lord, that is from the Divine which goes forth from Himself; this, then, is the signification here, of creating; that to create, when spoken of the church, and the men of the church, means to create anew, that is, to regenerate, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/294.htm">294</a>); and from the signification of heaven, the earth, and the sea, and the things which are in them, as denoting all things, interior and exterior, of heaven and the church. Heaven, the earth, and the sea, here signify specifically, the higher and lower heavens. Since in the spiritual world the appearance of things is similar to what it is, in the natural world, consequently, there are mountains, lands, and seas, and the mountains there are the higher heavens, because the angels of those heavens dwell upon mountains, and the land and sea there are the lower heavens, for the angels of these heavens dwell below the mountains upon the lands, and as it were in seas (see above, n. <a href="../ae/594.htm">594:18</a>). For this reason the angel who said these things, was seen to stand upon the earth and the sea. The reason why the earth, and the sea, and the things which are in them, also signify all things of the church, both interior and exterior, is, that in the church there are things interior and exterior, just as in the heavens there are things higher and lower, and the former correspond to the latter. That the sea and the earth signify the church as to its exteriors and interiors, may be seen above (600).<p>According to the sense of the letter, heaven, the earth, and the sea, mean the visible heaven, the habitable earth, and the navigable sea, and the things therein mean the birds, beasts, and fishes. But that these things are not meant by those words, is evident from this fact, that the angel was seen by John, when in the spirit, standing upon the sea and upon the earth. And what is seen in the spirit, is not seen in the natural world, but in the spiritual world, where also, as said above, there are lands and seas, and also angels and spirits therein. Concerning the appearance of seas in that world, and concerning those therein, see above (n. <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 609</h4><p>609. Who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, signifies the Lord in respect to all things of heaven and the church, interior and exterior. This is evident from the signification of "to create," as being not only to cause to be, but also to be perpetually, by holding it together and sustaining it by the Divine proceeding; for the heavens have had existence and perpetually have existence, that is, subsist by means of the Lord's Divine, which is called the Divine truth united to Divine good. This received by angels makes heaven. Thence it is that when heaven is mentioned the Lord is meant, because heaven, where the angels are, is heaven from the Lord, that is from the Divine proceeding from Him. This, therefore, is what is signified here by "to create." (That "to create," in reference to the church and to men of the church, means to create anew, that is, to regenerate, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/294.htm">294</a>.) The above is evident also from the signification of "heaven, earth, and sea, and the things that are in them," as being all things of heaven and the church, interior and exterior. "Heaven, earth, and sea," signify here in particular the higher and the lower heavens, since in the spiritual world the face of things is similar as in the natural world, that is, there are mountains, lands, and seas; the mountains there are the higher heavens, because the angels of those heavens dwell upon mountains, and the land and sea are the lower heavens, for the angels of these heavens dwell below the mountains upon the lands, and as it were in seas (See above, n. <a href="../ae/594.htm">594</a>). Thence it is that the angel who spoke these things was seen "standing upon the earth and the sea." "The earth and the sea and the things that are in them" signify also all things of the church, both interior and exterior, because there are in the church things interior and exterior, as there are in the heavens things higher and lower, and the former correspond to the latter. (That "the sea and the earth," signify the church in respect to its exteriors and interiors, may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/600.htm">600</a>.) According to the sense of the letter, "heaven, earth, and sea," mean the visible heaven, the habitable earth, and the navigable sea, and "the things therein" mean birds, beasts, and fishes; but that this is not the meaning of these words is evident from this, that John was "in the spirit" when he saw the angel "standing upon the sea and upon the earth;" and what is seen "in the spirit" is seen not in the natural world but in the spiritual world, where also, as has been said just above, there are earths and seas, and angels and spirits in them. But respecting the appearance of the seas in that world, and those who are in them, see above n. <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 609 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>609. "Qui creavit caelum et quae in eo, et terram et quae in ea, et mare et quae in eo." - Quod significet Dominum quoad omnia caeli et ecclesiae, interiora et exteriora, constat ex significatione "creare", quod non solum sit facere ut sit, sed etiam ut perpetuo sit, continendo et sustinendo per Divinum procedens; nam caeli exstiterunt et perpetuo existunt, hoc est, subsistunt, per Divinum Domini, quod vocatur Divinum Verum unitum Divino Bono: hoc receptum ab angelis facit caelum; inde est, cum dicitur caelum, quod intelligatur Dominus, quia caelum, ubi sunt angeli, est caelum ex Domino, hoc est, ex Divino ab Ipso procedente: hoc itaque hic significatur per "creare": (quod creare, cum de ecclesia, et de hominibus ecclesiae, sit e novo creare, hoc est, regenerare, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_609/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_294" target=_top>294</a> <sup>1</sup></p><p>): et ex significatione "caeli, terrae et maris, et quae in illis", quod sint omnia caeli et ecclesiae interiora et exteriora; per "caelum, terram et mare" in specie hic significantur caeli superiores et inferiores; quoniam in mundo spirituali similis facies rerum est quae in mundo naturali, nempe montes, terrae et maria; montes ibi sunt caeli superiores, quia angeli illorum caelorum super montibus habitant; ac terra et mare ibi sunt caeli inferiores, nam angeli horum caelorum infra montes super terris et sicut in maribus habitant (de qua re videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_609/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_594" target=_top>594</a> [d]); inde est quod angelus, qui haec locutus est, visus sit stare "super terra et mari." Quod per "terram et mare et quae in illis" etiam significentur omnia ecclesiae, tam interiora quam exteriora, est quia in ecclesia sunt interiora et exteriora, sicut in caelis sunt superiora et inferiora, et his illa correspondent. (Quod per "mare et terram" significetur ecclesia quoad exteriora et interiora ejus, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_609/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_600" target=_top>600</a>.) Secundum sensum litterae, per "caelum, terram et mare" intelliguntur caelum aspectabile, terra habitabilis et mare navigabile; et per "illa quae in illis" intelliguntur aves, bestiae et pisces: sed quod haec non intelligantur per illa verba, constare potest ex eo, quod angelus visus sit Johanni quando "in spiritu" fuit, stare super mari et super terra; et quod videtur in spiritu, hoc non videtur in mundo naturali, sed in mundo spirituali; ubi etiam, ut mox supra dictum est, sunt terrae et maria, et ibi sunt angeli et spiritus. Sed de apparentia marium in illo mundo, et de illis qui inibi sunt, videatur supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_609/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_342" target=_top>342</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;The editors made a correction or note here. </p>
