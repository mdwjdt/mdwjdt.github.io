<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1090</h4><p>1090. CHAPTER 18.<p>1.AND after these things, I saw [another] angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory.<p>2.And he cried out in strength with a great voice, saying. Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.<p>3.Because of the wine of the anger of her whoredom all nations have drunk, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her; and the merchants of the earth have waxed rich, through the power of her delicacies.<p>4.And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, lest ye become partakers of her sins, and lest ye receive of her plagues.<p>5.For her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her injustices.<p>6.Render unto her, even as she hath rendered unto you, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup with which she hath mixed, mix unto her double.<p>7.As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived delicately, so much give unto her torment and mourning, because she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am not a widow, and shall not see mourning.<p>8.For this, in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall be burned in the fire; for strong is the Lord God that judgeth her.<p>9.And the kings of the earth shall weep for her, and wail over her, who have committed whoredom with her and lived delicately, when they shall see the smoke of her burning.<p>10.Standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, that great city Babylon, that strong city; for in one hour thy judgment is come.<p>11.And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, because no one buyeth their merchandise any more;<p>12.Merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and crimson, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyme wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;<p>13.And cinnamon and incense, and ointment and frankincense, and wine and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts of burden and sheep, and horses and carriages, and slaves and souls of men.<p>14.And the fruits of the desire of thy soul have departed from thee, and all things fat and splendid have departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more.<p>15.The merchants of these, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;<p>16.And saying, Woe, woe, that great city, clothed in fine linen, and crimson and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stone, and pearls, for in one hour so great riches are devastated.<p>17.And every pilot, and all that are employed upon ships, and mariners, and as many as do work on the sea, stood afar off,<p>18.And cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like this great city?<p>19.And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness; because in one hour they are devastated.<p>20.Exult over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and ye prophets, because God hath judged your judgment concerning her.<p>21.And one strong angel took up a stone, as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon be cast down, that great city, and shall be found no more:<p>22.And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard in thee no more, and no craftsman of whatsoever craft shall be found in thee any more, and the voice of the mill shall be heard in thee no more:<p>23.And the light of a lamp shall shine in thee no more, and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard in thee no more; because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by thy sorcery have all the nations been seduced.<p>24.And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.<p>EXPLANATION.<p>Verse 1. And after these things I saw [another] angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory.<p>"After these things," signifies after the Last Judgment was accomplished upon those who are meant by the harlot; "I saw [another] angel coming down out of heaven," signifies the Divine proceeding from the Lord in heaven and in the world; "having great power," signifies to whom Omnipotence now belongs, both in the heavens and on earth; "and the earth was lightened with his glory," signifies the Church now in light from the influx and reception of Divine Truth. </p>

And after these things I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lightened by his glory.<p>2. And he cried out mightily with a great voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.<p>3. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the anger of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her; and the merchants of the earth have become rich from the abundance of her luxuries.<p>4. And I heard another voice from heaven saying, Come forth out of her, my people, that ye become not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.<p>5. For her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her injustices.<p>6. Render unto her even as she hath rendered unto you, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup that she hath mingled mingle to her double.<p>7. How much she hath glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so much torment and mourning give her, for in her heart she saith, I sit a queen, and a widow I am not, and mourning I shall not see.<p>8. For this reason in one day shall her plagues come, death and mourning and famine, and she shall be burned up in fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.<p>9. And the kings of the earth shall weep for her and wail over her, who have committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning;<p>10.

And cinnamon and incense, and ointment and frankincense, and wine and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts of burden and sheep, and horses and carriages, and slaves, and souls of men.<p>14. And the fruits of the desire of thy soul have departed from thee; and all fat and splendid things have departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more.<p>15. The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;<p>16. And saying, Woe, woe, that great city, arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold, precious stone and pearls; <sup>1</sup>for in one hour were devastated so great riches.<p>17. And every pilot, and all that are employed on ships, and sailors, and as many as work at sea, stood afar off,<p>18. And cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like this great city?<p>19. And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried out weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, that great city, wherein all that had ships in the sea were made rich by her costliness; for in one hour they were devastated.<p>20.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1090 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1090. CAPUT XVIII.<p>1. Et posthaec vidi [alium] angelum descendentem e caelo, habentem potestatem magnam, et terra illustrata est a gloria ejus.<p>2. Et exclamavit in virtute voce magna, dicens, Cecidit, cecidit Babylon magna, et facta est habitaculum daemoniorum, et custodia omnis spiritus immundi, et custodia omnis avis immundae et exosae.<p>3. Quia ex vino irae scortationis ejus biberunt omnes gentes, et reges terrae cum illa scortati sunt, et mercatores terrae ex facultatibus deliciarum ejus ditati sunt.<p>4. Et audivi aliam vocem e caelo dicentem, Exite ex illa, popule mi, ne participes fiatis peccatorum ejus, et ne recipiatis ex plagis ejus.<p>5. Quoniam pertigerunt ejus peccata usque ad caelum, et recordatus est Deus injustitiarum ejus.<p>6. Reddite illi quemadmodum illa reddidit vobis, et duplicate ei dupla secundum opera ejus, in poculo quo miscuit miscete illi duplum.<p>7. Quantum glorificavit se ipsam, et deliciata est, tantum date illi cruciatum et luctum, quia in corde suo dicit, Sedeo regina, et vidua non sum, et luctum non videbo.<p>8. Propter hoc in una die venient plagae ejus, mors et luctus et fames, et in igne comburetur, quia fortis Dominus Deus judicans illam.<p>9. Et deflebunt illam, et plangent super illa reges terrae, qui cum illa scortati sunt et deliciati, quando viderint fumum combustionis ejus;<p>10. E longinquo stantes propter timorem cruciatus ejus, dicentes, Vae, vae, urbs illa magna, Babylon, urbs illa valida, quia in una hora venit judicium tuum.<p>11. Et mercatores terrae flebunt et lugebunt super illa, quod merces eorum nemo emat amplius;<p>12. Merces auri et argenti, et lapidis pretiosi et margaritae, et byssi et purpurae, et serici et coccini, et omne lignum thyinum, et omne vas eburneum et omne vas ex ligno pretioso, et aere et ferro, et marmore;<p>13. Et cinnamomum et suffimenta, et unguentum et thus, et vinum et oleum, et similam et triticum, et jumenta et oves, et equos et rhedas, et mancipia et animas hominum.<p>14. Et fructus desiderii animae tuae abiverunt a te, et omnia pinguia et splendida abiverunt a te, et amplius non invenies illa.<p>15. Mercatores horum, qui divites facti ab illa, e longinquo stabunt propter timorem cruciatus ejus, flentes et lugentes;<p>16. Et dicentes, Vae, vae, urbs illa magna, circumamicta bysso et purpura et coccino, et inaurata auro, lapide pretioso et margaritis, [B.A. 17.] quia una hora devastatae sunt tantae divitiae.<p>17. Et omnis gubernator, et omnis super navibus versans, et nautae, et quotquot mare operantur, e longinquo steterunt,<p>18. Et clamaverunt, videntes fumum combustionis ejus, dicentes, Quae similis urbi isti magnae?<p>19. Et miserunt pulverem super capita sua, et clamaverunt flentes et lugentes, dicentes, Vae, vae, urbs illa magna, in qua ditati sunt omnes habentes naves in mari ex pretiositate ejus, quia una hora devastati sunt.<p>20. Exulta super ea caelum, et sancti apostoli et prophetae, quia judicavit Deus judicium vestrum de illa.<p>21. Et sustulit unus angelus robustus lapidem quasi molarem magnum, et projecit in mare, dicens, Sic impetu dejicietur Babylon, illa magna urbs, et non invenietur amplius.<p>22. Et vox citharaedorum et musicorum et tibicinum et buccinatorum non audietur in te amplius; et omnis artifex omnis artis non invenietur in te amplius, et vox molae non audietur in te amplius;<p>23. Et lux lucernae non lucebit in te amplius, et vox sponsi et sponsae non audietur in te amplius; quia mercatores tui erant magnates terrae, quia veneficio tuo seductae sunt omnes gentes.<p>24. Et in ea sanguis prophetarum et sanctorum inventus est, et omnium occisorum super terra.<p>EXPLICATIO.<p>VERSUS 1.<p>"Et posthaec vidi [alium] angelum descendentem e caelo, habentem potestatem magnum et terra illustrata est a gloria ejus." 1. "Posthaec", significat postquam ultimum judicium super illos qui per "meretricem" intelliguntur, factum est [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1090/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1091" target=_top>1091</a>] ; "vidi angelum descendentem a caelo", significat Divinum procedens a Domino in caelo et in mundo [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1090/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1092" target=_top>1092</a>] ; "habentem potestatem magnam, significat cui nunc omnipotentia sicut in caelis etiam in terris [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1090/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1093" target=_top>1093</a>] ; "et terra illustrata est a gloria ejus", significat ecclesiam nunc in luce ex influxu et receptione Divini Veri [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1090/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1094" target=_top>1094</a>] . </p>
