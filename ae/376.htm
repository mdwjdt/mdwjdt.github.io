<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 376</h4><p>376. Hitherto it has been shown that oil signifies celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord. It shall now also be shown that wine signifies spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and the good of faith; and because this good in its essence is truth, therefore it is said in the general explanation, "See thou hurt not the oil and the wine," which signifies that hurt should not be done to the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, either as to good or as to truth, or what is the same, that injury should not be offered to the goods and truths of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. The reason why the good of charity and the good of faith are in their essence truth, is because that good is implanted by the Lord in man's intellectual part by means of truths which are called the truths of faith, and when man lives according to them, then those truths become goods; for by truths a new will is formed in that part, and whatever proceeds from the will is called good. This will also is the same as conscience, and conscience is a conscience of truth, for it is formed by means of truths of every kind from the doctrine of the church, and from the sense of the letter of the Word. But on this subject see more in the <a href="../njhd/130.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 130-138</a>; and the extracts therein from the Arcana Coelestia. n, 139-141.) This now is why by wine is signified truth.</p><p>[2] Moreover, there are goods and truths internal and external; the internal goods and truths are signified by the oil and the wine which are not to be injured; but the external goods and truths are signified by the wheat and barley; external goods and truths are those in the sense of the letter of the Word, but internal goods and truths are those in the internal or spiritual sense of the Word; or, external goods and truths are such as are in the lower heavens, with the angels there, namely, in the ultimates of heaven, but internal goods and truths are such as are in the higher heavens, namely, in the third and second, with the angels there. The latter goods and truths are themselves genuine goods and truths, but the former are truths and goods which correspond, thus are correspondences; the former have immediate communication with the angels of heaven, whereas the latter have not an immediate but a mediate communication by correspondences. Hence it is that the Jews, because they were only in the sense of the letter, and not in the knowledge of the signification of things in the spiritual sense, could not injure the spiritual sense thereof either as to good or as to truth, consequently, they could not injure genuine goods and truths. This also is the case with the Christian Church at this day, which cannot injure the genuine goods and truths of the spiritual sense of the Word, for it is in ignorance of that sense, and, consequently, also ignorant of genuine goods and truths.</p><p>[3] The reason why the spiritual sense of the Word has not been made known to Christians, is, because the genuine goods and truths, such as are in the higher heavens, lie concealed in the spiritual sense of the Word; and so long as those goods and truths were not perceived and known, that sense could not be opened, for they could not be seen. The reason why genuine goods and truths have not been perceived and known in the Christian churches, is, because those churches have, in general, been divided into the papal and the evangelical; and in the papal church they are altogether ignorant of truths, because those who are therein do not depend upon the Word, thus upon the Lord, who is the Word, that is, the Divine truth, but upon the Pope, from whose mouth scarcely anything proceeds but what is from the love of ruling, and this love is from hell. Therefore, scarcely a single truth pertaining to the church exists with them; but in the evangelical churches faith alone has been assumed for the essential means of salvation, and thereby the good of love and charity has been rejected as not essential, and where good is rejected there no truth that is really truth can exist, all truth being from good. For the Lord flows into man's good, and by means of good enlightens him, and gives him light to perceive truths, therefore, without that light, which is the very spiritual life of man, there can be no truth. However it may sound like truth, because from the Word, it is truth falsified by the ideas which a man holds concerning it; for from faith separated from charity, or from truths without good, no other result can follow.<p>Hence then it is, that the spiritual sense of the Word could not be opened to the Christian churches; for if it had been opened, they would have falsified and perverted it by ideas from fallacies, and so would have profaned it. For this reason also no one will hereafter be admitted into the spiritual sense of the Word unless he is in genuine truths from good; and no one can be in genuine truths from good unless in his heart he acknowledges the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth, for from Him is every good and truth therefrom. The reason why the spiritual sense of the Word is, at this day, opened, and therewith also genuine truths and goods disclosed, is, because the Last Judgment has been accomplished by the Lord, and thus all things in the heavens and in the hells are reduced to order. And as a result it can be provided by the Lord that the genuine truths and goods, in the spiritual sense of the Word, shall not be injured, which could not have been provided for before (see the small work concerning the <a href="../lj/73.htm">Last Judgment 73</a>).</p><p>[4] That wine signifies spiritual good, or the good of charity and the good of faith, which in its essence is truth, is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah:<p>"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; buy wine and milk without money and without price" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_55_1.htm">55:1</a>).<p>Every one can see that it is not wine and milk, which they would buy without money; therefore by wine and milk are signified spiritual things, namely, by wine spiritual good, which in its essence is truth, as was said above, and by milk the good of that truth. That these are freely given by the Lord to such as are ignorant of truth and good, and yet desire them, is signified by "he that hath no money, come ye, buy, and eat, buy without money." To buy signifies to procure to oneself; and to eat to appropriate to oneself, which is done by application as of oneself. That those who are ignorant of truth and good, and yet desire them, are meant, is evident, for it is said, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters"; to thirst signifying to desire, and waters signifying truths, here the Word wherein they are contained.</p><p>[5] In Joel:<p>"It shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk; all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">3881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6363.htm">6363</a>). Hence by its rivers are signified the particulars thereof. (That by mountains is signified the good of love to the Lord, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/795.htm">795</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4210.htm">4210</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8327.htm">8327</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8758.htm">8758</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">10438</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10608.htm">10608</a>; and by hills the good of charity towards the neighbour, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">10438</a>; and this because in heaven those dwell on mountains who are in the good of love to the Lord, and, upon hills those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbour, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">10438</a>; and in the work concerning <a href="../hh/188.htm">Heaven and Hell 188</a>.)</p><p>[6] In Amos:<p>"Behold, the days come, that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop new wine, and all the hills shall melt. I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities; and they shall sit and plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. Then will I plant them upon their land" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9164.htm">9164</a>). By the waste cities, which they shall build, are signified the doctrinals of truth and good from the Word hitherto destroyed, and afterwards to be restored; by the vineyards which they shall plant, and of which they shall drink the wine, are signified all things of the church from which is intelligence, a vineyard signifying the spiritual church, whence by vineyards are signified all things of the church. By wine is signified the truth thereof in general; and by drinking it is signified to be instructed and become intelligent, thus intelligence; and by the gardens which they shall make, and of which they shall eat the fruit, is signified wisdom, gardens denoting all things of intelligence, and the fruit of them signifying goods of life; thus by eating their fruit is signified the appropriation of good, thus wisdom, for wisdom is formed when truths are committed to the life; and because these things are meant, it is therefore said of Israel, I will plant them upon their land.</p><p>[7] In Moses:<p>"He bindeth his ass's-colt to the vine, the son of his she-ass unto the choice vine; he washeth his raiment in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes; his eyes are red with wine, and his teeth white with milk" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6375.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6375-6381</a>.)</p><p>[8] In the same:<p>"Jacob brought of his venison to his father Isaac, and he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he drank. And Isaac blessed him, saying, God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatnesses of the earth, and plenty of corn and new wine" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3570.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3570</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3579.htm">3579</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3580.htm">3580</a>.)</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>If ye shall hearken unto my precepts, I will give rain to your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, and thou shalt gather in thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_14.htm">14</a>).<p>These blessings of the earth were promised to the sons of Israel if they would hear and do Jehovah's precepts, which also attended them, because with them the church was representative, and the things that were said and commanded by Jehovah corresponded to spiritual things, thus the blessings of the earth to the blessings of heaven. The blessings of heaven, to which the blessings of the earth correspond, have all reference to such things as belong to the good of love and the truth of faith; such blessings, therefore, are signified by the former and the latter rain, for rain specifically signifies the Divine truth flowing in out of heaven, from which all things of the church and heaven with man are born, grow, and are brought forth; wherefore by the corn, new wine, and oil, which they should gather, are signified every good and truth of the external and internal man.</p><p> [10] In the same:<p>"Thus Israel dwelt securely, solitary at the fountain of Jacob, in a land of corn and new wine; his heavens also dropped down dew" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>).<p>This was the conclusion of the blessings of the children of Israel by Moses, which were all prophetical; and every son and every tribe of Israel signified something of the church, as in Gen. xlix. Here Israel signifies the church itself; and by dwelling securely and solitary at the fountain of Jacob, is signified to live without infestation from evils and falsities, and to be led by the Lord alone by means of Divine truth; the fountain of Jacob denoting Divine truth and the Word. And by living in a land of corn and new wine, is signified in all the good and truth of the church; and by his heavens also shall drop down dew, is signified influx out of heaven.</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>"He made him ride upon the high places of the earth, and gave him butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs, and of rams of the sons of Bashan, and of goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the blood of the grape, pure wine" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_14.htm">14</a>).<p>These things are said of the Ancient Church, which was that before the Israelitish Church, and was in the good of charity and in the truths of faith. The goods of every kind, in which it was, are meant by those things, namely, by butter of the herd, milk of the flock, the fat of lambs, the fat of rams, the fat of goats, the fat of kidneys of wheat; and the spiritual truths by the blood of the grape and pure wine (merum).</p><p>[12] In Jeremiah:<p>"They shall come and sing in the height of Zion., and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, to the wheat, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the sons of the flock and of the herd" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_12.htm">31:12</a>).<p>By wheat, new wine, and oil, are signified goods and truths of every kind (what they mean specifically may be seen above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_8.htm">62:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_9.htm">9</a>).<p>These things are said concerning Jerusalem, by which is signified the church as to doctrine. By the corn, therefore, which shall no longer be given as food for the enemies, and by the new wine, which the sons of the stranger shall not drink, are signified in general the good and truth of the church, which shall no longer be consumed by evils and falsities; enemies here denoting evils; and the sons of the stranger, falsities; and eating or food, to be given unto them; and drinking denoting to consume. That goods and truths shall abide with those who receive them, and thence make use of them, is signified by, "they who gather it, shall eat it; and they who bring it together, shall drink it." The worship from these is signified by praising Jehovah, and drinking in the courts of holiness.</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>"Joy is taken away, and exultation from Carmel; and in the vineyards there is no singing, there is no shouting for joy; the treader treadeth not out the wine in the wine-press; I have made the vintage shouting to cease" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_16_10.htm">16:10</a>).<p>The taking away of heavenly delight from good and the truths thence, because good and truth itself, is thus described. The good of the church is meant by Carmel, and the truths thence by vineyards and by treading out the wine in the wine-presses; the delights thereof, which are taken away, by joy, exultation, singing, shouting, and vintage shouting; for it was customary to sing in the vineyards, and in the wine-presses, when the grape was trodden into wine, on account of the representation of the delights from truths, which were signified by wine.</p><p>[14] In Jeremiah:<p>"O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee above the weeping of Jazer; thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer; the spoiler is fallen upon thy fruits of autumn, and upon thy vintage. Whence is collected joy and gladness out of Carmel, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused the wine to fall in the wine-presses; none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_32.htm">48:32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_33.htm">33</a>).<p>Here also the removal of heavenly delight, from the good of love and the truths thence, is treated of, for all heavenly delight is in these and from these. Lamentation over it is meant by grievous weeping; the deprivation thereof, by which joy and gladness is collected out of Carmel, also by the spoiler falling upon them, by [the wine] failing, and the shouting being no shouting; the good which was taken away, for which there was lamentation, is meant by the fruits of autumn; and the truths of good which were taken away, by the vintage and by the wine in the wine-presses. That truths were banished, and that they perished by scientifics, is meant by the wine of Sibmah, and by the plants thereof having gone over the sea, even to the sea of Jazer, the sea signifying the scientific part.</p><p>[15] In Lamentations:<p>"The infant and the suckling faint in the streets of the city. They say to their mothers, Where is the corn and the wine? when they faint as one that is slain in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out upon the bosom of their mothers" (<a href="../hh/276.htm">Heaven and Hell 276-283</a>, <a href="../hh/285.htm">285</a>, <a href="../hh/288.htm">288</a>, <a href="../hh/341.htm">341</a>, <a href="../hh/382.htm">382</a>). By the streets of the city are signified truths of doctrine; by mothers are signified all things of the church; and by corn and wine are signified all the good and truth thereof in general. The reason why it is said that they faint as one slain in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out upon the bosom of their mothers, is, because one that is slain signifies those who perish spiritually through deprivation of truth, and by the soul is signified spiritual life. (That the streets of the city in which they faint signify truths of doctrine, may be seen, n. 2336; and that the mother, into whose bosom the soul is poured out, signifies the church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2691.htm">2691</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2717.htm">2717</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3703.htm">3703</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4257.htm">4257</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5581.htm">5581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8897.htm">8897</a>.)</p><p>[16] In Zephaniah:<p>"Their wealth shall be a prey, and their houses a waste: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_13.htm">1:13</a>).<p>By the wealth that shall be for a prey, is signified spiritual wealth, which is the knowledges of good and truth; by the houses becoming a waste are signified those things in man that pertain to the church; from which, when they are devastated, [men] then profit and receive nothing, although they hear them and see them in the Word, is signified by, building and not inhabiting, and planting vineyards, and not drinking the wine thereof; houses denoting the goods of the church, and vineyards together with wine denoting the truths thereof.</p><p>[17] Similar things are meant in Micah:<p>"Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olive, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil and new wine, but shalt not drink wine" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_15.htm">6:15</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>"Vineyards of desire shall ye plant, but ye shall not drink the wine of them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_11.htm">5:11</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>"The corn-floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall deceive them. They shall not make wine-offerings to Jehovah, and they shall not be pleasing unto him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_2.htm">9:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_4.htm">4</a>).<p>By the corn-floor and the wine-press are signified the same as by corn and wine, because in these places they are brought together; that they shall not profit from the things heard, is signified by, they "shall not feed them, and the new wine shall deceive them"; and hence their worship was not accepted, is signified by, "they shall not make wine-offerings to Jehovah, and they shall not be pleasing," namely, the libations, unto Him.</p><p>[18] In Joel:<p>"Awake ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine, which is cut off from your mouth. The field is wasted, the land mourned, for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth; the husbandmen were ashamed; the vinedressers howled" (<a href="../ae/374.htm">374</a>), where they are explained; and that by wine and new wine is meant the truth of the church, and by vinedressers those who are in truths and teach them; the subject here treated of being the devastated church, in which goods and truths have perished.</p><p>[19] In Ezekiel:<p>"Damascus was thy trader by the multitude of thy works, by the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and the wool of Zachar" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_18.htm">27:18</a>).<p>This is said of Tyre, by which is signified the church as to the knowledges of good and truth; and by Damascus, which was a city of Syria, is signified the scientific part concordant; and by the tradings, which are treated of in that chapter, are signified the acquisition and communication, and also the use, of them. Because Damascus signifies the scientific part concordant, it is therefore said, it was a trader by the multitude of all works and riches; and by works, from which uses are effected, are signified the knowledges of good, and by riches the knowledges of truth; and because the knowledges of truth and good are in the natural man, for therein is everything cognizable, perceptible, and knowable, it is therefore said, in the wine of Helbon, and the wool of Zachar; the wine of Helbon signifying natural truth, and the wool of Zachar natural good.</p><p>[20] In Isaiah:<p>"A curse shall devour the earth. The new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish, all the merry-hearted shall sigh. They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. The city of emptiness shall be broken; every house shall be shut up, that no man come in" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_6.htm">24:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_10.htm">10</a>).<p>By these words is described the perversion of the church, which is when falsity rules in the place of truth, whence there is no longer any good, for man has good by means of truths. By the earth which the curse shall devour, is signified the church; the curse denoting the perversion thereof; by the new wine mourning, and the vine languishing, is signified all the truth of the church, to mourn and to languish signifying its deprivation; that there shall no longer be any heavenly delight and blessing, is signified by, all the merry-hearted shall sigh, they shall not drink wine with a song; that they shall turn away from all things which agree with truths, is signified by, strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it, strong drink signifying the things that are from truths and agree with them; but that the doctrine of falsity shall be destroyed, is signified by, the city of emptiness shall be broken, a city denoting doctrine, and emptiness denoting falsity; and that good and wisdom shall be no longer with man, is signified by, every house shall be shut up, that no man come in, which takes place when there is no truth, but falsity only.</p><p>[21] In Amos:<p>"Who drink out of bowls of wine, and anoint themselves with the first-fruits of the oils; but they are not grieved for the breaking of Joseph" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1094.htm">1094</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1175.htm">1175</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7724.htm">7724</a>; that the Jews were formerly and are at the present time in external worship without internal, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1200.htm">1200</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8871.htm">8871</a>; that Joseph signifies the spiritual church, and hence also the spiritual of the church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6417.htm">6417</a>.)</p><p>[22] In Zechariah:<p>"I will render powerful the house of Judah, and I will keep the house of Joseph; hence they shall be as the powerful Ephraim, and their heart shall be glad as if with wine" (<a href="../hh/228.htm">Heaven and Hell 228-233</a>; and also above, n. <a href="../ae/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>; that Judah in the Word signifies the Lord's celestial kingdom, in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6363.htm">6363</a>; and Ephraim, the Intellectual of the church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6267.htm">6267</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6296.htm">6296</a>.)</p><p>[23] In Daniel:<p>"Belshazzar king of Babylon, and his princes, and his wives, and his concubines, drank wine out of the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, and they praised the gods [of gold,] silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone. Therefore there was written on the wall, numbered, weighed, divided. And he <sup>1</sup>was afterwards driven out from the sons of man, and his dwelling was with the wild asses" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_2.htm">5:2-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_21.htm">21</a>).<p>In the internal sense the profanation of good and truth is here described, which also Babel or Babylon denotes; for by drinking wine out of the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, is signified to imbibe the truths of the church from the Word, to drink wine denoting to imbibe truths, and the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem denoting those things that pertain to the doctrine of the church from the Word; and to praise the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone, signifies worship from the love of self and of the world; for by those gods is signified idolatrous worship of every kind, and profanation; that therefore it was written on the wall, numbered, weighed, divided, signifies separation from all things of heaven and the church. That he <sup>1</sup>was afterwards driven out from the sons of man, and had his dwelling with the wild asses, signifies separated from all truth, and the allotment of his life with the infernals; the sons of man denoting the truths of the church; wild asses denoting those who are in dire falsities, such as are in the hells; and dwelling denoting the lot which is of the life.</p><p>[24] In Joel:<p>"They have cast lots over my people; for they have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, which they drank" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_3.htm">3:3</a>).<p>By casting lots over the people, is signified to dissipate the truths of the church, to cast lots signifying to dissipate, and the people signifying the church as to truths, thus also the truths of the church; by giving a boy for a harlot, is signified to falsify truth, for a boy denotes the truth of the church, and a harlot denotes falsity; and by selling a girl for wine which they drank, is signified to pervert the good of the church by truth falsified, a girl denoting the good of the church, and wine denoting truth falsified.</p><p>[25] Because wine signified the truth of the church which is from good, therefore it was commanded that, with the sacrifices upon the altar, they should also offer a meat-offering and a drink-offering, and the meat-offering was bread, and the drink-offering wine, by which was signified the worship of the Lord from the good of love, and from the truths thence, all worship being from these. (Concerning the drink-offerings and the different portions of wine in them at the different sacrifices, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_29_40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_29_41.htm">41</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_23_13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Num. 6:1-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_4.htm">15:4-7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_28_7.htm">28:7-10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_28_24.htm">24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_28_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_6.htm">29:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_22.htm">22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_28.htm">28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_38.htm">38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_39.htm">39</a>; and in addition <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_35_14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>). Hence it is evident what is signified in Joel:<p>"The meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of Jehovah, the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, mourned" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_9.htm">1:9</a>).<p>This means, that worship from the good of love, and the truths thence, had perished. Who cannot see that the meat-offering and drink-offering, which were bread and wine, could not be pleasing to Jehovah in worship, unless they had signified such things as pertain to heaven and the church?</p><p>[26] From these considerations it is now evident what the bread and wine in the Holy Supper involve, namely, bread the good of love from the Lord to the Lord, and wine the good of faith which in its essence is truth. (But concerning the Holy Supper, and concerning the bread and wine therein, see the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>).<p>"I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>).<p>By the fruit of the vine, or the wine, which the Lord would drink new with them in His Father's kingdom, or when the kingdom of God should come, is meant that all Divine truth in heaven and the church would then proceed from His Divine Human; therefore He calls it new, and He calls it also the New Testament in His blood (verse 20); for the Lord's blood signifies the same as wine (see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_17.htm">4:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_7.htm">10:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_28.htm">12:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_28.htm">16:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_1.htm">9:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_33.htm">33</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_11.htm">9:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_60.htm">60</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_11.htm">10:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_16.htm">16:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_20.htm">17:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_42.htm">23:42</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_51.htm">51</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_36.htm">John 18:36</a>.<p>Because, now, as bread signifies the good of love, and wine the good of faith, which in its essence is truth from that good, and, in the highest sense, bread the Lord as to the Divine good, and wine the Lord as to the Divine truth; and because there is a correspondence between spiritual things and natural, and there is such a correspondence, so that, when man thinks of bread and wine, the angels think of the good of love and the good of faith; and because all things of heaven and the church have reference to the good of love and the good of faith, therefore, the Holy Supper was instituted by the Lord, that by it there might be a conjunction of the angels of heaven with the men of the church.</p><p>[27] Such things being meant by bread and wine in heaven, therefore<p>"Melchizedek king of Salem" going out to meet Abram, "brought forth bread and wine; and he was the priest of the most high God." And he blessed Abram (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_14_18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_14_19.htm">19</a>).<p>By Melchizedek is here represented the Lord as to the Divine good and Divine truth; by him as a priest the Divine good, and by him as a king the Divine truth; therefore he brought forth bread and wine, because by bread is signified the Divine good, and by wine is signified the Divine truth; or, applied to man, by bread is signified the good of love to the Lord, and by wine the good of faith, which is from the reception of Divine truth.<p>The same is signified by the Lord by wine in the following.</p><p>[28] In Matthew:<p>"They do not put new wine into old bottles; else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out; but they put [new] wine into new bottles, and both are preserved" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_17.htm">9:17</a>).<p>In Luke:<p>"And no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for he saith the old is better" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_39.htm">5:39</a>).<p>Because all comparisons in the Word are from correspondences, so also is this comparison; and by wine is signified truth, by old wine, the truth of the old or Jewish Church; and by bottles are signified those things that contain; by old bottles, the statutes and judgments of the Jewish Church, and by new bottles, the Lord's precepts and commandments. That the statutes and judgments of the Jewish Church, which especially concerned the sacrifices and representative worship, are not in agreement with the truths of the Christian Church, is meant by, "they do not put new wine into old bottles, else the bottles break and the wine runneth out, but they put [new] wine into new bottles, and both are preserved together." That those who were born and educated in the externals of the Jewish Church could not be led immediately into the internals of the Christian Church, is signified by, "no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for be saith the old is better."</p><p>[29] The same is signified by the water turned into wine in Cana of Galilee, concerning which it is thus written in John:<p>In the marriage in Cana of Galilee, when the wine failed, "there were set there six water-pots of stone, according to the purifying of the Jews. Jesus said, Fill the water-pots, which they filled to the brim. Then he said unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was made wine, he called the bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when they have had enough, that which is worse; thou hast kept the good wine until now" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7337.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7337</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9051.htm">9051</a>), this miracle similarly. By a marriage here, as elsewhere in the Word throughout, is signified the church; in Cana of Galilee that amongst the Gentiles; and by water is signified the truth of the external church, such as was the truth of the Jewish Church from the sense of the letter of the Word; and by wine is signified the truth of the internal church, such as is the truth of the Christian Church. Hence the Lord's making the water wine, signifies that He would make the truths of the external church truths of the internal church, by opening the internal things that lay concealed in them. By the six water-pots of stone, set after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, are signified all those things in the Word, and thence in the Jewish Church and its worship, all of which were representative and significative of things Divine in the Lord, and from the Lord, which contained things internal. Therefore also, there were six of stone, set for the purifying of the Jews, the number six signifying all, and being said of truths, stone signifies truth, and the purification of the Jews purification from sins, thus all things of the Jewish Church. For the church regards purification from sins as its all, for in proportion as any one is purified therefrom, in the same proportion he becomes a church. By the ruler of the feast are meant those who are in the knowledges of truth; his saying to the bridegroom, "Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have had enough, that which is worse; thou hast kept the good wine until now," signifies that every church commences by truths from good, but afterwards ends in truths not from good, and that still, at the end of the church, truth from good, or genuine truth, is given from the Lord.</p><p>[30] Because wine signifies the truth of the church, and oil the good thereof, therefore, the Lord says, in the parable of the man who was wounded by thieves,<p>That the Samaritan poured oil and wine into his wounds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_33.htm">Luke 10:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_34.htm">34</a>).<p>Here by the man wounded by thieves are meant those who are infested and wounded as to their conscience by evil men, who are robbers; and by the Samaritan are meant the Gentiles, who are in the good of charity; hence by pouring into his wounds oil and wine are signified the spiritual things that heal a man thus injured, oil denoting the good of love and wine the good of faith or truth. What the other particulars signify, namely, that he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and bade them take care of him, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_6.htm">25:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_36_17.htm">36:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_7_4.htm">Hos. 7:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_7_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_7_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_5.htm">14:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_7.htm">7</a>; Amos. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_15.htm">Zech. 9:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_15.htm">Psalms 104:15</a>).</p><p>[31] Because most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so also has wine, and in that sense it signifies truth falsified, and also falsity, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>"Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, to the flower of his decaying glory, which is upon the head of the valley of the fat ones confused with wine; the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under the feet; these stray through wine, and through strong drink they wander from the way; the priests and the prophets stray through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they wander from the way through wine, they stray among the seeing, they totter in judgment" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_28_1.htm">28:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_28_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_28_7.htm">7</a>).<p>These things are said of those who are insane in spiritual things, because they believe themselves to be intelligent from themselves, and, consequently, glory in it; the state of such is here described by pure correspondences. Those who are insane in spiritual things or in truths, are meant by drunkards, and those who thence believe themselves intelligent, by Ephraim; and the vaunting of their intelligence or erudition thence, by the crown of pride; for those who are in falsities of doctrine, and have confirmed themselves therein, when they are enlightened and see truths in the other life, become, as it were, drunkards. Such the learned become, who have confirmed themselves in falsities, and to confirm oneself in falsities is to do so from oneself and not from the Lord. Hence it is clear what is signified by, "Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim." By "the flower of decaying glory which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones confused with wine," is signified the truth of the church destroyed in its birth from the vaunting of man's own intelligence, which pertains to the natural man separated from the spiritual, who then sees falsity instead of truth. The flower of glory denotes truth in its birth falling or perishing, the head of the valley of the fat ones denotes the intelligence of the natural man; confused with wine denotes those who see falsity instead of truth; "the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under the feet," signifies that that intelligence shall entirely perish; "these stray through wine, and through strong drink they wander from the way," signifies by falsities and by such things as are therefrom; "the priest and the prophet stray through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they wander from the way through wine," signifies that those who ought to be in the doctrine of good and truth are of such a quality, and apart from persons, that their doctrine itself is of such a quality; "they stray among the seeing, they totter in judgment," signifies that they do not see the truths of intelligence. That such things are signified by these words no one can see except from the spiritual sense, without which it could not be known that the crown and the head signify intelligence; that drunkards signify those who are insane in things spiritual; that Ephraim signifies the understanding, here man's own or from himself; that valley signifies the lower things of the mind, which are natural and sensual, and that a priest and prophet signify the doctrine of good and truth.</p><p>[32] In the same:<p>"Pause, wonder, be astonished, and make a cry; they are drunken, and not with wine; they stagger, and not with strong drink. For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your heads, the seers hath he covered" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_9.htm">29:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_10.htm">10</a>).<p>These things are said of those who can see nothing of truth when they hear and read it from the Word; those who are such are called drunken, not with wine, and they stagger, and not with strong drink; wine signifying specifically the truth of the spiritual, and hence of the rational man, and strong drink the truth of the natural man thence. Because such are meant, it is, therefore, said, Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the spirit of sleep denoting no perception, and the closed eyes denoting no understanding. "The prophets and your heads hath he covered," signifies those who were in the doctrine of truth, and thence wise and intelligent; prophets signifying those who are in the doctrine of truth, and abstractedly the doctrine itself; the heads signifying the wise, and in the abstract wisdom; and the seers signifying the intelligent, and in the abstract intelligence. Wonder at the greatness of their stupidity, is described by, "Pause, wonder, be astonished," and lamentation over them by, "make a cry." Such are those who are in a life of evil, and are at the same time in principles of falsity, however learned they may be supposed to be; for by a life of evil the perception of good is shut out, from which thought has life and light, and by principles of falsity the understanding of truth is shut out, whence they see only from the sensual man, and not at all from the spiritual.</p><p>[33] In the same:<p>"Dogs obdurate in soul, they know not satiety; the same are the shepherds, they know not to understand; Come, I will take wine, and we will be drunk with strong drink" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_56_10.htm">Isaiah 56:10-12</a>).<p>These [words] are said of those who care for nothing but worldly and terrestrial things, by which the internal spiritual man is closed. From having no perception of good and no understanding of truth, they are called dogs obdurate in soul, which know not satiety, that is, who cannot receive good; to know here signifies to be able, and satiety the reception of good, for satiety is predicated of food, by which spiritual nourishment is signified. That neither have they any understanding of truth, is meant by, "the same are the shepherds, they know not to understand"; those being called shepherds who believe themselves able to instruct others, for to feed denotes to instruct; and because such love falsities and things falsified, it is therefore added, "Come, I will take wine, and we will be drunk with strong drink."</p><p>[34] In Jeremiah:<p>"Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine. Behold, I fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings thereof that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_13_12.htm">13:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_13_13.htm">13</a>).<p>Here also by wine is signified falsity, and by every bottle which shall be filled with wine is signified the mind [mens] of man, because that is a recipient of truth or falsity, as a bottle is of wine. By the kings thereof that sit upon the throne of David, are signified those who should otherwise be in Divine truths; by the priests, those who should be in Divine goods; by prophets, those who are in doctrine; by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all who belong to the church; and by the drunkenness with which they shall be filled is signified insanity in spiritual things.</p><p>[35] In the same:<p>"I am become as a drunkard, and as a man whom wine hath entered, because of Jehovah, and because of the word of his holiness. For the land is full of adulterers" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_9.htm">23:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_10.htm">10</a>).<p>This is a lamentation over the adulteration of good, and the falsification of truth in the church, which is signified by the land being full of adulterers; those things are signified by adulteries, and the church, by the land. Insanity in spiritual things through reasonings from evils against Divine goods, and from falsities against Divine truths, is signified by, I am become as a drunkard, and as a man whom wine hath entered, because of Jehovah, and because of the word of His holiness. To become as a drunkard and as a man whom wine hath entered, signifies perturbation of mind, and insanity from reasonings from evils and falsities; because of Jehovah, signifies because of Divine goods, and because of the word of His holiness, signifies because of Divine truths.</p><p>[36] In Isaiah:<p>"Hear this, thou afflicted and drunken, but not with wine" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_21.htm">51:21</a>).<p>By the drunken but not with wine, are here meant those who are in falsities from ignorance of the truth.<p>Noah drank of the wine, and was drunken, and hence lay naked in the midst of his tent (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>).<p>In the spiritual sense something altogether different is meant from what appears in the sense of the letter; similarly by,<p>Lot was made drunken by his daughters, and they then lay with him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_19_32.htm">Genesis 19:32-34</a>).<p>What is meant by the drunkenness of Noah, in the spiritual sense, may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_7.htm">51:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_5.htm">Joel 1:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_7.htm">7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_10_8.htm">Leviticus 10:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_10_9.htm">9</a>).</p><p>[37] That by wine, in an opposite sense, is signified falsity, also appears in Isaiah:<p>"Woe unto them that rise early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue unto twilight, till wine inflames them. But they regard not the work of Jehovah, and see not the work of his hands. Woe to the wise in their own eyes, and the intelligent before their own faces. Woe unto the heroes to drink wine, and the men of strength to mingle strong drink" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_11.htm">5:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_22.htm">22</a>).<p>These things are said of those who frame for themselves doctrinals from their own intelligence, and not from the Lord, or out of the Word from Him, whence they are mere falsities; therefore by, "Woe to them who, rising early in the morning, follow strong drink, to them that linger unto twilight, till wine inflames them. But they regard not the work of Jehovah, and see not the work of his hands," are signified the perverted states of those who believe themselves to be enlightened from themselves, whence they are in falsities of doctrine, and care not for the Word, from which they may know goods and truths of life and of doctrine. To rise early in the morning, and continue till twilight, signifies to be enlightened; and to follow strong drink, and to be inflamed with wine, signify to pour forth doctrinals from themselves; not to regard the work of Jehovah, and not to see the work of His hands, signifies not to care for the Word, and the goods of life and truths of doctrine there discovered; the work of Jehovah being said of goods of life, and the work of His hands of the truths of doctrine, both from the Word. Because such persons are meant, therefore, it is said, "Woe to the wise in their own eyes, and the intelligent before their own faces!" and by the wise in their own eyes are signified those who are so from their own intelligence; and by the intelligent before their own faces are signified those who are so from their own affection; the eyes signifying understanding, and the face, affection. And by, "Woe unto the heroes to drink wine, and the men of strength to mingle strong drink," are signified to such as aspire after great things, and are ingenious in confirming the falsities that favour the loves of self and their own principles; heroes denoting those who aspire to great things; men of strength, those who are ingenious, and seem to themselves to be intelligent. To drink wine denotes to imbibe falsities, and to mingle strong drink denotes to confirm them; such are all those who are in the love of self, and who seek after the fame of learning, for such are in their proprium, and cannot be raised above it; therefore their thought is in the corporeal Sensual, to which no truth appears, and by which no spiritual good is perceived; whereas those who are not in the love of self, and who seek intelligence for the sake of the uses of life, are raised by the Lord from the proprium into the light of heaven - they themselves not knowing - and are thereby enlightened.</p><p>[38] In Hosea:<p>"Whoredom and new wine have possessed the heart. My people interrogate wood, and their staff answereth them; for the spirit of whoredoms hath seduced them, and they have committed whoredom under their God. Ephraim is joined to idols; their wine hath departed; they commit whoredom continually" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_11.htm">4:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_18.htm">18</a>).<p>It is here treated of those who falsify truths, the falsification of truth being signified by whoredom, and the falsity thence by new wine; hence it is evident what is signified by, "whoredom and new wine have possessed the heart; the spirit of whoredoms hath seduced them, they have committed whoredom under their God, and the wine hath departed, they commit whoredom continually," namely, that they falsify Divine truths, and that, consequently, they have not any truth; to commit whoredom under their God, signifies to falsify Divine truths, and the wine hath departed, signifies that, consequently, they have not any truth. By Ephraim being joined to idols, are signified those who are in their own intelligence, and by the idols to which he is joined are signified the falsities of their religion. By, "My people interrogate wood, and their staff answereth them," is signified that they consult their self-love, and cherish it from their own intelligence; for wood, or an idol of wood, which they interrogate signifies self-love, and the staff which answers, signifies power, thus intelligence from the proprium.</p><p>[39] In the Apocalypse:<p>"Babylon is fallen, is fallen; that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. If any one worship the beast, he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, mixed pure in the cup of the wrath of God; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_8.htm">14:8-10</a>).<p>In another place:<p>"I will show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication; and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_1.htm">17:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_2.htm">2</a>).<p>And again:<p>"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_3.htm">18:3</a>).<p>By the wine of the wrath of God is signified the falsity of evil, and by the wine of fornication is signified truth falsified; what is meant by the other expressions will be seen in the explanation of them, likewise what by these words in the Apocalypse:<p>"Babylon the great came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of God's wrath" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_19.htm">16:19</a>).<p>What is signified by the wine of God's wrath is also signified by the chalice or cup of God's wrath.</p><p>[40] In Jeremiah:<p>"Babylon hath been a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making the whole earth drunken; the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"There is a cup in the hand of Jehovah, and he hath mixed wine in it; he hath filled it with mixture; and he hath poured it out; but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall suck out and drink" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_8.htm">Psalms 75:8</a>).<p>Because by the meat-offering and the drink-offering, which were bread and wine, are signified worship from the good of love and the truths of faith, hence in an opposite sense, by the meat- and drink-offering is signified worship from the evils of the love of evil, and from the falsities of faith; this was signified by the meat-offering and drink-offering that were offered to idols and other gods (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_6.htm">57:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">44:17-19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_38.htm">Deuteronomy 32:38</a>; and elsewhere). From the signification of wine it is evident what is signified in the Word by a vineyard, by a vine, by the branches thereof, and by the grapes; namely, that by a vineyard is signified the spiritual church, or the church that is in the truths and goods of doctrine from the Word; by the vine, the doctrine itself; by its branches the truths from which the doctrine is formed; and by the grapes, which are the fruit of the vineyards and vines, the goods of charity and the goods of faith; but of these it shall be treated elsewhere.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 376</h4><p>376. It has thus far been shown that "oil" signifies celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; it shall now be shown that "wine" signifies spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor and the good of faith; and as this good in its essence is truth, it is said in the general explanation that "the oil and the wine hurt not," which signifies that there must no harm be done to the internal or spiritual sense of the Word in respect either to good or to truth, or what is the same, that there must no harm be done to the goods and truths which are in the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. The good of charity and the good of faith in their essence are truth, because that good is implanted by the Lord in man's intellectual part by means of the truths that are called the truths of faith, and when man lives according to these truths they become goods; for by means of truths a new will is formed in that part, and whatever proceeds from the will is called good. This will, moreover, is the same as conscience, and conscience is a conscience of truth, for it is formed by truths of every kind from the doctrine of the church, and from the sense of the letter of the Word (but on this subject see further in <a href="../njhd/130.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 130-138</a>; and the extracts from the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/139.htm">Arcana Coelestia 139-141</a>). From this now it is that "wine" signifies truth.</p><p>[2] Furthermore, there are goods and truths internal and external; internal goods and truths are signified by "the oil and the wine" that must not be hurt; but external goods and truths are signified by "wheat and barley." External goods and truths are those that are in the sense of the letter of the Word, while internal goods and truths are those that are in the internal or spiritual sense of the Word; or external goods and truths are such as are in the lower heavens with the angels there, that is, in the ultimates of heaven, while internal goods and truths are such as are in the higher heavens with the angels there, that is, in the third and second heavens. These goods and truths are genuine goods and truths themselves, but the former are truths and goods because they correspond, thus are correspondences; internal goods and truths have immediate communication with the angels of heaven, while external goods and truths have not an immediate but a mediate communication through correspondences. This is why the Jews, because they were only in the sense of the letter and had no knowledge of the signification of things in the spiritual sense, were unable to do harm to the spiritual sense in respect either to good or to truth, and consequently were unable to do harm to genuine goods and truths. So the Christian Church at this day is unable to do harm to the genuine goods and truths which are in the spiritual sense of the Word, for it has been ignorant of that sense, and at the same time ignorant of genuine goods and truths.</p><p>[3] The spiritual sense of the Word was not disclosed to Christians, because genuine goods and truths, such as are in the higher heavens, lie concealed in the spiritual sense of the Word; and so long as these goods and truths were unperceived and unknown that sense could not be opened, since these goods and truths could not be seen. In the Christian churches genuine goods and truths have not been perceived and known for the reason that those churches have been divided, in general, into the Papal and the Evangelical; and those in the Papal Church are utterly ignorant of truths, because they do not depend upon the Word, thus upon the Lord who is the Word, that is, Divine truth, but upon the pope, from whose mouth scarcely anything proceeds except what is from the love of ruling, and that love is from hell; therefore with them scarcely a single truth of the church exists; while in the Evangelical churches faith alone has been assumed as the essential means of salvation, and as a consequence the good of love and charity has been rejected as nonessential, and where good is rejected no truth which is truth in itself can exist, since all truth is from good; for the Lord flows into man's good, and by means of good illustrates him and gives him the light to perceive truths, therefore without that light, which is man's very spiritual life, there is no truth, however much it may sound like truth because it is from the Word; it is truth falsified by the ideas that are held in respect to it; for from faith separate from charity, or from truths without good, no other result can follow. This is why the spiritual sense of the Word could not be disclosed to the Christian churches, for if it had been disclosed, they would have falsified and perverted it by ideas from fallacies, and thus would have profaned it. This also is why no one will ever hereafter be admitted into the spiritual sense of the Word unless he is in genuine truths from good, and no one can be in genuine truths from good unless in heart he acknowledges the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth, for from Him is every good and thence every truth. The spiritual sense of the Word is at this day opened, and therewith also genuine truths and goods are disclosed, because the Last Judgment has been accomplished by the Lord, and thus all things in the heavens and in the hells have been reduced to order; and for this reason it can be provided by the Lord that no harm can be done to genuine truths and goods, which are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and this could not have been provided before (See in the small work on <a href="../lj/73.htm">The Last Judgment 73</a>).</p><p>[4] That "wine" signifies spiritual good, or the good of charity and the good of faith, which in its essence is truth, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah:<p>Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and eat; buy wine and milk without silver and without price (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_55_1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p>Anyone can see that this does not mean that wine and milk may be bought without silver, "wine and milk" therefore signify things spiritual, namely, "wine" spiritual good, which in its essence is truth, as was said above, but "milk" the good of that truth. That these are given by the Lord freely to those who are ignorant of truth and good, and yet in a desire for these, is signified by "he that hath no silver, come ye, buy and eat; buy without silver;" "to buy" signifies to acquire for oneself, and "to eat" signifies to make one's own, which is done by application as from oneself. Those who are ignorant of truth and good, and yet are in a desire for them, are evidently meant, for it is said, "Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters," "to thirst" signifying to desire, and "waters" signifying truths, here the Word where truths are.</p><p>[5] In Joel:<p>It shall come to pass in that day, the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk; all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3881</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3881[1-11]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6363.htm">6363</a>; therefore "its water-courses" signify the particulars of the Word; that "mountains" signify the good of love to the Lord, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/795.htm">Arcana Coelestia 795</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4210.htm">4210</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8327.htm">8327</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8758.htm">8758</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">10438</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10608.htm">10608</a>; and "hills" the good of charity towards the neighbor, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">10438</a>; and this because in heaven those who are in the good of love to the Lord dwell upon mountains, and those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor dwell upon hills, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10438.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10438</a>, and Heaven and Hell, n. <a href="../hh/188.htm">188</a>.)</p><p>[6] In Amos:<p>Behold the days come, that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that draweth forth seed; and the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and all the hills shall dissolve. I will bring back the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities; and they shall inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof, and they shall make gardens and eat the fruit of them. Then will I plant them upon their ground (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9164.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9164</a>). "The waste cities that they shall build" signify the doctrinals of truth and good from the Word, before destroyed and at that time to be restored; "the vineyards which they shall plant," and "the wine of which they shall drink," signify all things of the church from which there is intelligence, "a vineyard" signifies the spiritual church, and therefore "vineyards" signify all things of the church; "wine" signifies the truth of the church in general, and "to drink it" signifies to be instructed and become intelligent, thus intelligence; and "the gardens which they shall make, and the fruit of which they shall eat," signifies wisdom, "gardens" meaning all things of intelligence, and their "fruit" signifying the goods of life, thus "to eat their fruit" signifies the appropriation of good, thus wisdom, for wisdom comes when truths are committed to the life; and because this is what is meant, therefore it is said of Israel, "I will plant them upon their ground."</p><p>[7] In Moses:<p>He bindeth his foal to the vine, the son of his she-ass unto the noble vine; he washeth his vesture in wine, and his covering in the blood of the grapes. His eyes are red with wine, and his teeth white with milk (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6375.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6375-6381</a>.)</p><p>[8] In the same:<p>Jacob brought of his venison to his father Isaac, and he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he drank. And Isaac blessed him, saying, God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatnesses of the earth, and plenty of corn and new wine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3570.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3570</a>), n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3579.htm">3579</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3580.htm">3580</a>.)</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>If ye shall harken to My commandments, I will give rain to your land in its time, the former rain and the latter rain; and thou shall gather in thy corn, and thy new wine, and thy fresh oil (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_11_13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-14</a>).<p>These blessings of the earth were promised to the sons of Israel if they would hear and do the commandments of Jehovah, and the blessings followed because with them the church was representative, and the things that were said and commanded by Jehovah corresponded to things spiritual, thus these blessings of the earth to the blessings of heaven. The blessings of heaven, to which the blessings of the earth correspond, all have reference to the things that are of the good of love and the truth of faith; these blessings therefore are signified by "the former rain and the latter rain," for "rain" in particular signifies Divine truth flowing in out of heaven, from which all things of the church and heaven with man are born, grow, and are brought forth; therefore "the corn, new wine, and oil, which they should gather in," signify every good and truth of the external and internal man.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Thus Israel dwelt securely, alone by the fountain of Jacob, in a land of corn and new wine; yea, his heavens shall drop down dew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>).<p>This was the conclusion of the blessings of the sons of Israel by Moses, which were all prophetical, and every son or every tribe of Israel signified something of the church (as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_49_1.htm">Genesis 49</a>); and here "Israel" signifies the church itself; and "to dwell securely, alone by the fountain of Jacob," signifies to live without infestation from evils and falsities, and to be led by the Lord alone through Divine truth, the "fountain of Jacob" meaning Divine truth and the Word; and "to live in a land of corn and new wine" signifies in every good and truth of the church; and "yea, his heavens shall drop down dew," signifies influx out of heaven.</p><p>[11] In the same:<p>He made him ride upon the high places of the earth, and gave him butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs, and of rams, the sons of Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and thou drinkest the blood of the grape, unmixed wine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13-14</a>).<p>These things are said of the Ancient Church, which was the church previous to the Israelitish Church, and was in the good of charity and in truths of faith. The goods of every kind, in which it was, are meant by these things, namely, the "butter of the herd," the "milk of the flock," "the fat of lambs," "the fat of rams," "the fat of goats," "the fat of the kidneys of wheat;" and spiritual truths are meant by "the blood of the grape" and "unmixed wine."</p><p>[12] In Jeremiah:<p>They shall come and sing aloud in the height of Zion, and shall flow together unto the good of Jehovah, to the corn, and to the new wine, and to the fresh oil, and to the sons of the flock and of the herd (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>).<p>"Corn," "new wine," and "fresh oil," signify goods and truth of every kind (what these mean in particular, see above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_62_8.htm">Isaiah 62:8-9</a>).<p>This is said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church in relation to doctrine; therefore "the corn that shall no longer be given as food for the enemies, and the new wine that the sons of the alien shall not drink" signify in general the good and truth of the church, which shall no longer be consumed by evils and falsities; "enemies" here meaning evils, and "the sons of the alien" falsities, and "to eat," or "to have food given them," and "to drink," mean to consume. That goods and truths will remain with those who receive them, and thence make use of them, is signified by "they that gather it shall eat it," and "they that bring it together shall drink it;" worship from these is signified by "praising Jehovah," and "drinking in the courts of holiness."</p><p>[13] In the same:<p>Gladness is taken away, and exultation from Carmel; and in the vineyards there is no singing aloud, no shouting for joy; the treader treadeth not out the wine in the wine-vats; I have made the vintage-shouting to cease (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_16_10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>).<p>This describes the taking away of the heavenly enjoyment that is from good and its truths, because good and truth itself is taken away; the good of the church is meant by "Carmel," and its truths by "vineyards" and by "treading out the wine in the wine-vats;" the enjoyments thereof that are taken away are meant by "gladness," "exultation," "singing aloud," "shouting," and "vintage-shouting," for it was a custom to sing in the vineyards, and in the winepresses when the grape was trodden into wine, that enjoyments from truths, which were signified by "wine," might be represented.</p><p>[14] In Jeremiah:<p>With more than the weeping of Jazer I will weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah; thy shoots are passed over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer; upon thy autumn fruits, and upon thy vintage the devastator is fallen. Whence gladness and exultation is gathered out of Carmel, and out of the land of Moab; and I have caused the wine to cease in the wine-vats; none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32-33</a>).<p>This also treats of the taking away of the heavenly enjoyment that is from the good of love and the truths thence, for all heavenly enjoyment is in these and from these. Lamentation over it is meant by "weeping" [flere fletum]; deprivation of it is meant by "gladness and exultation is gathered out of Carmel," likewise by "the devastator falling upon it," "the wine failing," and "the shouting being no shouting;" the good that was taken away, for which there was lamentation, is meant by "the autumn fruits;" and the truths of good that were taken away are meant by "the vintage," and by "the wine in the wine-vats." That truths were banished, and that they perished through knowledges [scientifica] is meant by "the vine of Sibmah," and by its "shoots that have gone over the sea, even to the sea of Jazer," "sea" signifying the knowing faculty [scientificum].</p><p>[15] In Lamentations:<p>The infant and the suckling faint in the broad places of the city. They say to their mothers, Where is the corn and the wine? when they faint as one pierced in the broad places of the city, when their soul is poured out upon their mother's bosom (<a href="../hh/276.htm">n. 276-283</a>, <a href="../hh/285.htm">285</a>, <a href="../hh/288.htm">288</a>, <a href="../hh/341.htm">341</a>, <a href="../hh/382.htm">382</a>). "The broad places of the city" signify the truths of doctrine; "mothers" all things of the church; "corn and wine" all the good and truth of the church in general. It is said that "they faint as one pierced in the broad places of the city, when their soul is poured out upon their mother's bosom," because "one pierced" signifies those who perish spiritually from the deprivation of truth, and "soul" signifies spiritual life. (That "the broad places of the city, in which they faint," signify the truths of doctrine, see Arcana Coelestia, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2336.htm">2336</a>; and that "the mother, into whose bosom the soul is poured out," signifies the church, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2691.htm">n. 2691</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2717.htm">2717</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3703.htm">3703</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4257.htm">4257</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5581.htm">5581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8897.htm">8897</a>)</p><p>[16] In Zephaniah:<p>Their wealth shall be for plunder, and their houses for a waste, that they may build houses but not inhabit them, and plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zephaniah_1_13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13</a>).<p>The "wealth that shall be for plunder" signifies spiritual wealth, which is the knowledges of good and truth; "the houses that shall be for devastation" signify the things of the church in man; that from these when devastated one profits nothing and receives nothing, even though he listens to them, and sees them in the Word, is signified by "building and not inhabiting, and planting vineyards and not drinking the wine thereof," "houses" meaning the goods of the church, and "vineyards" with "wine" its truths.</p><p>[17] Like things are meant in Micah:<p>Thou shalt sow but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olive but shalt not anoint thee with oil, and the new wine but shall not drink wine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_6_15.htm">Micah 6:15</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>Vineyards of desire shall ye plant, but ye shall not drink the wine of them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>).<p>And in Hosea:<p>The threshing-floor and the wine-vat shall not feed them, and the new wine shall dissemble unto them. They shall not pour forth wine to Jehovah, and these shall not be agreeable unto Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_9_4.htm">4</a>).<p>The "threshing-floor and the wine-vat" signify the same as "corn and wine," because corn and wine are there collected; that they will not profit by what they hear is signified by "they shall not feed them, and the new wine shall dissemble unto them;" and that thence their worship is not accepted is signified by "they shall not pour forth wine to Jehovah, and these (that is, the offerings) shall not be agreeable unto Him."</p><p>[18] In Joel:<p>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine which is cut off from your mouth. The field is devastated, the ground mourned, for the corn was devastated, the new wine was dried up, the fresh oil languisheth; the husbandmen were ashamed; the vine-dressers howled (<a href="../ae/374.htm">374</a>, where they are explained; "wine" and "sweet wine" meaning the truth of the church, and "vine-dressers" those who are in truths and teach them. This treats of a devastated church, in which goods and truths have perished.</p><p>[19] In Ezekiel:<p>Damascus was thy trader in the multitude of thy works, in the multitude of all riches, in the wine of Heshbon <sup>1</sup>and the wool of Zachar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>).<p>This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in relation to the knowledges of good and truth; and "Damascus," which was a city in Syria, signifies the concordant knowing faculty [scientificum]; and the "tradings" referred to in this chapter signify the acquisition and communication and also the use of these. Because "Damascus" signifies the concordant knowing faculty, it is called a "trader in the multitude of all works and riches," "works" by which uses are effected, signifying the knowledges of good, and "riches" the knowledges of truth; and as the knowledges of truth and good are in the natural man, for therein is everything pertaining to cognition and knowing that is perceptible, therefore it is said "in the wine of Heshbon and the wool of Zachar," the "wine of Heshbon" signifying natural truth, and the "wool of Zachar" natural good.</p><p>[20] In Isaiah:<p>A malediction shall devour the earth; the new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish, all the glad of heart shall sigh. They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. The city of voidness shall be broken down; every house shall be shut, that no one come in (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_6.htm">Isaiah 24:6-7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_24_9.htm">9-10</a>).<p>These words describe the perversion of the church, which takes place when falsity rules in place of truth, whence there is no longer any good; for man has good by means of truths. "The earth that the malediction will devour" signifies the church, "malediction" meaning its perversion; the "new wine that will mourn," and the "vine that will languish," signify all truth of the church, "to mourn" and "to languish" signifying deprivation of it; that there shall no longer be any heavenly enjoyment and blessedness is signified by "all the glad of heart shall sigh, they shall not drink wine with a song;" that they shall turn away from all things that agree with truths is signified by "strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it," "strong drink" signifying the things that are from truths and agree with them. But that the doctrine of falsity shall be destroyed is signified by "the city of voidness shall be broken down," "city" meaning doctrine, and "a void" falsity; and that there shall no longer be any good or wisdom with man is signified by "every house shall be shut, that no one come in," which takes place when there is no truth, but only falsity.</p><p>[21] In Amos:<p>Who drink out of bowls of wine, and anoint themselves with the firstfruits of the oils; but they are not grieved for the breach of Joseph (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1094.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1094</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1175.htm">1175</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7724.htm">7724</a>; that the Jews were formerly and still are in external worship without internal, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1200.htm">1200</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8871.htm">8871</a>; that "Joseph" signifies the spiritual church, thus also the spiritual of the church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3971.htm">3971</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4669.htm">4669</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6417.htm">6417</a>)</p><p>[22] In Zechariah:<p>I will render the house of Judah mighty and I will save the house of Joseph; on this account they shall be as the mighty Ephraim, and their heart shall be glad as if with wine (<a href="../hh/228.htm">Heaven and Hell 228-233</a>; and also above, n. <a href="../ae/209.htm">209</a>, <a href="../ae/333.htm">333</a>; that "Judah" in the Word signifies the Lord's celestial kingdom, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3881</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3881.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3881[1-11]</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6363.htm">6363</a>; and "Ephraim" the intellectual of the church, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6267.htm">6267</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6296.htm">6296</a>.)</p><p>[23] In Daniel:<p>Belshazzar king of Babylon, and his magnates, and his wives, and his concubines, drank wine out of vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, and praised the gods of silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone. Therefore there was written on the wall, Numbered, weighed, and divided. And then he [Nebuchadnezzar] was driven out from the sons of man, and his dwelling was with the wild asses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_2.htm">Daniel 5:2-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_21.htm">21</a>).<p>In the internal sense this describes the profanation of good and truth, which also is meant by "Babel" or "Babylon;" for "to drink wine out of the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem" signifies to draw the truths of the church from the Word, "to drink wine" meaning to draw truths, and "the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem" meaning the truths that belong to the doctrine of the church from the Word; and "to praise the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone" signifies worship from the love of self and the world; for these gods signify idolatrous worship of every kind, and profanation; that it was therefore written on the wall, "numbered, weighed, divided" signifies separation from all things of heaven and the church. That afterwards "the king was driven out from the sons of man, and his dwelling was with the wild asses" signifies separation from all truth, and the allotment of his life with the infernals, "sons of man" meaning the truths of the church, "wild asses" those who are in dire falsities like those in the hells, and "dwelling" meaning the allotment of the life.</p><p>[24] In Joel:<p>They have cast a lot upon My people; for they have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, which they drank (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_3_3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>).<p>"To cast lots upon the people" signifies to dissipate the truths of the church, "to cast a lot" signifying to dissipate, and "people" signifying the church in relation to truths, thus also the truths of the church; "to give a boy for a harlot" signifies to falsify truth, "boy" meaning the truth of the church, and "harlot" falsity; and "to sell a girl for wine, which they drank" signifies to pervert the good of the church by truth falsified, "girl" meaning the good of the church, and "wine" truth falsified.</p><p>[25] Because "wine" signified the truth of the church that is from good, it was commanded that, with the sacrifices upon the altar, a meal-offering and a drink-offering should be offered, and the meal-offering was bread, and the drink-offering wine; these signified worship of the Lord from the good of love, and from the truths therefrom; for all worship is from these. (On the drink-offerings, the portions of wine with them at the different sacrifices, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_29_40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_29_41.htm">41</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_23_13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_6_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_4.htm">15:4-7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_28_7.htm">28:7-10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_28_24.htm">24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_28_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_6.htm">29:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_22.htm">22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_28.htm">28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_38.htm">38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_29_39.htm">39</a>; and besides <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_35_14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>) This makes clear what is signified in Joel:<p>The meal-offering and the drink-offering was cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, the ministers (of the altar), mourned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>);<p>namely, that worship from the good of love, and from the truths therefrom, had perished. Who cannot see that the meal-offering and the drink-offering, which were bread and wine, were not pleasing to Jehovah in worship, unless they had signified such things as are of heaven and the church?</p><p>[26] From this it can now be seen what the bread and wine in the Holy Supper involve, namely, the bread, the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and the wine, the good of faith, which in its essence is truth. (But on the Holy Supper and the bread and wine of it, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>).<p>I say unto you, I will not drink of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>).<p>"The product of the vine," that is, "wine," which the Lord "would drink with them new in His Father's kingdom," or "when the kingdom of God should come," means that all Divine truth in heaven and the church would then be from His Divine Human; He therefore calls it "new," and also He calls it "the new testament in his blood" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>); for "the Lord's blood" has a like signification as "wine" (See above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_8.htm">4:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_7.htm">10:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_28.htm">12:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_28.htm">16:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_1.htm">9:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_33.htm">33</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_11.htm">9:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_27.htm">27</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_60.htm">60</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_11.htm">10:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_16.htm">16:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_20.htm">17:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_42.htm">23:42</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_51.htm">51</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_36.htm">John 18:36</a>. Now, because "bread" signifies the good of love, and "wine" the good of faith, which in its essence is the truth from that good, and in the highest sense, "bread" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine good, and "wine" the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and because there is a correspondence between spiritual things and natural, (and such a correspondence that when "bread" and "wine" are in man's thought, the good of love and the good of faith are in the angels' thoughts), and because all things of heaven and the church have reference to the good of love and the good of faith, therefore the Lord instituted the Holy Supper in order that by means of it there might be a conjunction of the angels of heaven with the men of the church.</p><p>[27] Because such things are meant by "bread and wine" in heaven, therefore:<p>Melchizedek, king of Salem, going out to meet Abram, brought out bread and wine; and he was a priest to God Most High. And he blessed Abram (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_14_18.htm">Genesis 14:18-19</a>).<p>"Melchizedek" here represents the Lord in relation to Divine good and in relation to Divine truth, as priest in relation to Divine good, and as king to Divine truth; therefore he "brought out bread and wine," "bread" signifying Divine good, and "wine" Divine truth; or when applied to man, "bread" signifying the good of love to the Lord, and "wine" the good of faith, which is from the reception of Divine truth.</p><p>[28] The "wine" spoken of by the Lord in the following passages has a like signification:<p>They do not put new wine into old wine-skins, else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled; but they put [new] wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_9_17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>).<p>And no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for he saith, The old is more useful (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_39.htm">Luke 5:39</a>).<p>This comparison, like all others in the Word, is from correspondences, "wine" signifying truth, "old wine" the truth of the old or Jewish Church, and "wine-skins" things that contain, "old wine-skins" the statutes and judgments of the Jewish Church, and "fresh wine-skins" the precepts and commandments of the Lord. That the statutes and judgments of the Jewish Church, which related especially to sacrifices and representative worship, are not in agreement with the truths of the Christian Church is meant by "they do not put new wine into old wine-skins, else the wine-skins burst and the wine is spilled; but they put [new] wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved together." That those who have been born and educated in the externals of the Jewish Church cannot be brought immediately into the internals belonging to the Christian Church is signified by "no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for he saith, "The old is more useful."</p><p>[29] The same is signified by "the water turned into wine at Cana of Galilee," thus described in John:<p>At the wedding in Cana of Galilee, when the wine failed, there were six water-pots of stone set there, according to the cleansing of the Jews. Jesus said, Fill the water-pots; and they filled them to the brim. Then he said unto them Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast; and they bare it. While the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was made wine, he calleth the bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when they have had enough, the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine until now (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7337.htm">Arcana Coelestia 7337</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9051.htm">9051</a>). So with this miracle; here, as elsewhere in the Word, "a wedding" signifies the church; "in Cana of Galilee" means among the Gentiles; "water" the truth of the external church, such as was the truth of the Jewish Church from the sense of the letter of the Word, and "wine" the truth of the internal church, such as is the truth of the Christian Church; therefore the Lord's "making the water wine" signifies that of the truths of the external church He will make truths of the internal church by opening the internal things that have lain concealed in them. "The six water-pots of stone, set there according to the cleansing of the Jews," signify all these truths in the Word, and thence in the Jewish Church and its worship; these were all representative and significative of things Divine in the Lord and from the Lord, which contained things eternal. For this reason there were "six water-pots of stone, set for the cleansing of the Jews;" the number "six" signifies all, and is predicated of truths; "stone" signifies truth, and "the cleansing of the Jews" purification from sins; thus all things of the Jewish Church are signified, since that church regards purification from sins as its all, for so far as anyone is purified from sins, so far he becomes a church. "The ruler of the feast" means those who are in the knowledges of truth; his saying to the bridegroom, "every man setteth on first the good wine; and when men have had enough, the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine until now," signifies that every church has its beginning in truths from good, but falls away into truths not of good, but that now, at the end of the church, truth from good, or genuine truth, is granted, namely by the Lord.</p><p>[30] It is because "wine" signifies the truth of the church, and "oil" the good of the church, that the Lord says, in the parable of the man who was wounded by thieves:<p>That the Samaritan poured oil and wine into his wounds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>);<p>where "the man wounded by thieves" means those who are infested and have their conscience hurt by evil men, who are "robbers;" and "the Samaritan" means the Gentiles that are in the good of charity; therefore "his pouring into his wounds oil and wine" signifies the spiritual things that heal a man thus injured, "oil" meaning the good of love, and "wine" the good of faith, or truth. What the rest signifies, namely, "that he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and told them to take care of him," may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_6.htm">25:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_36_17.htm">36:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_7_4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_7_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_7_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_14_5.htm">14:5-7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_2_8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_15.htm">Zechariah 9:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_14.htm">Psalms 104:14-16</a>).</p><p> [31] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so, too, has "wine," and in that sense it signifies truth falsified, and also falsity, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, to the flower of his fading adornment, which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones frenzied with wine; the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, they shall be trampled under the feet; these go astray through wine, and through strong drink they err; the priest and the prophet go astray through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they err through wine, <sup>2</sup>they go astray among the seeing, they waver in judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_28_1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_28_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_28_7.htm">7</a>).<p>This is said of those who are insane in things spiritual because they believe themselves to be intelligent of themselves, and glory in it; the state of such is here described by pure correspondences; those who are insane in things spiritual or in truths are meant by "the drunkards," and those who thence believe themselves intelligent by "Ephraim," and hence glorying in intelligence or learning is meant by the "crown of pride;" for those who are in falsities of doctrine and have confirmed themselves in them, when they are illustrated and see truths, in the other life become like drunkards. The learned who have confirmed themselves in falsities become such, and to confirm oneself in falsities is to confirm from oneself and not from the Lord. This makes clear what is signified by "woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim;" "the flower of the fading adornment that is on the head of the valley of the fat ones frenzied with wine" signifies the truth of the church destroyed even as it is born by the glorying of the self-intelligence that is of the natural man separated from the spiritual, when falsity is seen instead of truth, "the flower of the adornment" meaning truth as it is born declining or perished; "the head of the valley of the fat ones" means the intelligence of the natural man; "frenzied with wine" means those who see falsity in place of truth; "the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, they shall be trampled under the feet," signifies that this intelligence shall utterly perish; "these go astray through wine, and through strong drink they err," signifies through falsities and through such things as are from falsities; "the priest and the prophet go astray through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are gone astray through strong drink," signifies that such are those who ought to be in the doctrine of good and truth, and in a sense abstracted from persons that such is their doctrine itself; "they go astray among the seeing, they waver in judgment," signifies that they do not see the truths of intelligence. That these words have such a signification no one can see except from the spiritual sense; without that it could not be known that "crown" and "head" signify intelligence, that "drunkards" signify those who are insane in things spiritual, that "Ephraim" signifies here man's own understanding, or that which is from himself, that "valley" signifies the lower things of the mind, which are natural and sensual, and that "priest and prophet" signify the doctrine of good and truth.</p><p>[32] In the same:<p>Linger ye, wonder, be astounded, and cry out; they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink; for Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed up your eyes; the prophets and your heads, the seers hath He covered (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_9.htm">Isaiah 29:9-10</a>).<p>This is said of those who can see nothing of truth when they hear or read it from the Word; those who are such are called "drunken but not with wine," and "they stagger, but not with strong drink," "wine" signifying in particular the truth of the spiritual and thus of the rational man, and "strong drink" the truth of the natural man therefrom. Because such are meant it is said, "Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed up your eyes," "the spirit of deep sleep" meaning no perception, and the "eyes closed up" no understanding. "The prophets and your heads [the seers] hath He covered," signifies those who are in the doctrine of truth and were wise and intelligent thence; "prophets" signify those who are in the doctrine of truth, and in an abstract sense, doctrine itself, "heads" signify the wise, and in an abstract sense, wisdom, and "seers" signify the intelligent, and in an abstract sense, intelligence. Wonder at such gross stupidity is described by "Linger ye, wonder, be astounded," and lamentation over it by "cry out." Such are those who are in a life of evil, and at the same time in the principles of falsity, however learned they are believed to be; for a life of evil shuts out the perception of good by which thought has life and light, and the principles of falsity shut out the understanding of truth, on which account they see from the sensual man only, and not at all from the spiritual.</p><p>[33] In the same:<p>The dogs are strong of soul, they know not satiety; and they are shepherds who know not intelligence. Come, I will take wine and we will be drunk with strong drink (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_56_11.htm">Isaiah 56:11-12</a>).<p>This is said of those who care for nothing but worldly and earthly things, which close the internal spiritual man. These, from having no perception of good and no understanding of truth, are called "dogs strong of soul, they know not satiety," that is, they are unable to receive good, "to know" here signifies to be able, and "satiety" reception of good, for satiety is predicated of food, by which spiritual nourishment is signified. That they have no understanding of truth is meant by "they are shepherds who know not intelligence;" those are called "shepherds" who believe themselves able to instruct others, for "to feed" means to instruct; and because such persons love falsities and things falsified, it is added, "Come, I will take wine, and we will be drunk with strong drink."</p><p>[34] In Jeremiah:<p>Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine. Behold I fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings sitting for David upon his throne, and the priests and the prophets, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_13_12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12-13</a>).<p>Here, too, "wine" signifies falsity, and "every bottle that shall be filled with wine" signifies the mind of man, since the mind is a recipient of truth or of falsity, as a bottle is of wine; "the kings sitting for David upon his throne" signify those who would otherwise be in Divine truths, "priests" those who would be in Divine goods, "prophets," those who would be in doctrine, "the inhabitants of Jerusalem" all who are of the church; and "the drunkenness with which they shall be filled" signifies insanity in spiritual things.</p><p>[35] In the same:<p>I am become like a drunkard, and like a man into whom wine hath passed, because of Jehovah, and because of the words of His Holiness. For the land is full of adulterers (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_23_9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9-10</a>).<p>This is a lamentation over the adulteration of good and falsification of truth in the church, which is signified by "the land is full of adulterers;" these are meant by "adulteries," and the church by "land." Insanity in spiritual things through reasonings from evils against Divine goods and from falsities against Divine truth is signified by, "I am become like a drunkard, and like a man into whom wine has passed, because of Jehovah, and because of the words of His Holiness;" "to become like a drunkard and like a man into whom wine hath passed" signifies confusion of mind and insanity by reasoning from evils and falsities; "because of Jehovah" signifies because of Divine goods, and "because of the words of his holiness" signifies because of Divine truths.</p><p>[36] In Isaiah:<p>Hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken but not with wine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_51_21.htm">Isaiah 51:21</a>).<p>The "drunken but not with wine," mean here those who are in falsities from ignorance of truth. That:<p>Noah drank of the wine and was drunken, and therefore lay naked in the midst of his tent (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>);<p>means in the spiritual sense, something entirely different from the meaning in the letter; likewise:<p>Lot's being made drunken by his daughters, and their then lying with him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_19_32.htm">Genesis 19:32-34</a>).<p>What is meant by the drunkenness of Noah in the spiritual sense may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_5.htm">Joel 1:5-7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_10_8.htm">Leviticus 10:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_10_9.htm">9</a>).</p><p>[37] That "wine" in a contrary sense signifies falsity, is also evident from Isaiah:<p>Woe unto them that rise early in the morning, that follow strong drink; to them that delay until twilight till wine inflames them. But they do not look upon the work of Jehovah, and they see not the working of His hands. Woe to the wise in their own eyes, and the intelligent before their own faces. Woe unto the mighty in drinking wine, and to men of strength to mingle strong drink (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_11.htm">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_21.htm">21-22</a>).<p>This is said of those who frame for themselves doctrinals from self-intelligence not from the Lord, or from Him out of the Word, which consequently are mere falsities. "Woe unto them who rise early in the morning, who follow strong drink, to them who delay until twilight till wine inflame them; but they do not look upon the work of Jehovah, and they see not the working of His hands" signifies therefore the perverted states of those who believe that they are illustrated of themselves, whence they are in falsities of doctrine, and care not for the Word, from which they might know goods and truths of life and of doctrine. "To rise early in the morning," and "to delay until twilight" signifies to be illustrated; and "to follow strong drink," and "to be inflamed with wine" signifies to hatch out doctrinals of themselves; "not to look upon the work of Jehovah," and "not to see the working of His hands" signifies not to care for the Word, or the goods of life and the truths of doctrine there disclosed; "the work of Jehovah" is predicated of the goods of life, and "the working of His hands" of the truths of doctrine, both from the Word; because such persons are meant, therefore it is said, "Woe to the wise in their own eyes, and the intelligent before their own faces;" "the wise in their own eyes" signifying those who are wise from their own intelligence, and "the intelligent before their own faces" signifying those who are intelligent from their own affection, "eyes" signifying the understanding, and "face" affection. And "woe unto the mighty in drinking wine, and to men of strength to mingle strong drink," signifies unto such as aspire after great things, and are ingenious in confirming the falsities that favor the loves of self and their own principles; "the mighty" are those who aspire to great things; "men of strength" those who are ingenious, and seem to themselves to be intelligent; "to drink wine" means to imbibe falsities, and "to mingle strong drink" means to confirm them. Such are all those who are in the love of self, and who seek after the reputation for learning, for such are in what is their own, and cannot be elevated above it; therefore their own thought is in the corporeal sensual, by which no truth is seen, and no spiritual good is perceived. But those who are not in the love of self, and who seek intelligence for the sake of the uses of life, are elevated by the Lord from what is their own into the light of heaven, and though not themselves aware of it, are illustrated.</p><p>[38] In Hosea:<p>Whoredom and new wine have taken up the heart. My people ask the wood, and their rod answereth them; for the spirit of whoredom hath led them astray, and they have committed whoredom under their God. Ephraim is joined to idols; their wine is gone; in whoring they commit whoredom (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_11.htm">Hosea 4:11-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_17.htm">17-18</a>).<p>This treats of those who falsify truths; the falsification of truth is signified by "whoredom," and the falsity therefrom by "new wine." This makes clear what is signified by "whoredom and new wine have taken up the heart; the spirit of whoredoms hath seduced them, they have committed whoredom under their God, and the wine hath departed, in whoring they commit whoredom," namely, that such falsify Divine truths, and consequently have no truth at all, "to commit whoredom under their God" signifies to falsify Divine truths, and "the wine hath departed" signifies that consequently they have no truth at all; "Ephraim, who is joined to idols" signifies those who are in self-intelligence, and the "idols to which he is joined" signify the falsities of religion. "My people ask the wood, and their rod answereth them" signifies that they consult their self-love, and favor it from self-intelligence; for "wood" or an idol of wood, which they ask, signifies self-love, and "the rod that answers" signifies power from what is one's own, thus intelligence.</p><p>[39] In Revelation:<p>Babylon is fallen is fallen, the great city, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she hath made all nations to drink. If anyone worshipeth the beast he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which hath been mingled unmixed in the cup of the anger [of God]; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_8.htm">Revelation 14:8-10</a>);<p>I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunk from the wine of her whoredom (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_1.htm">Revelation 17:1-2</a>).<p>For of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all nations drunk, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>).<p>"The wine of the anger of God" signifies the falsity of evil, and "the wine of whoredom" signifies truth falsified; what the rest means will appear in the explanation of it, likewise what these words mean in Revelation:<p>Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the wrath of God's anger (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>);<p>"The wine of God's anger" having the same meaning as "the chalice, or cup, of God's anger."</p><p>[40] In Jeremiah:<p>Babylon hath been a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making the whole earth drunken; the nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are mad (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>).<p>And in David:<p>There is a cup in the hand of Jehovah, and He hath mingled the wine, hath filled it with mixture, and hath poured out; but the lees of it all the wicked of the earth shall suck out and drink (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_75_8.htm">Psalms 75:8</a>).<p>As the "meal-offering" and the "drink-offering," which were bread and wine, signify worship from the good of love and the truths of faith, so in a contrary sense, the "meal-offering" and "drink-offering" signify worship from the evils that are of the love of evil, and from the falsities of faith; this was signified by the "meal-offering" and "drink-offering" that were offered to idols and to the gods (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_57_6.htm">Isaiah 57:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_11.htm">65:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">44:17-19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_32_38.htm">Deuteronomy 32:38</a>). From the signification of "wine" it can be seen what "vineyard," "vine," its "branches," and "grapes" signify in the Word, namely, that "a vineyard" signifies the spiritual church, that is, the church that is in the truths and goods of doctrine from the Lord, "a vine" the doctrine itself, its "branches" truths from which doctrine is formed, and "the grapes" which are the fruit of vineyards and of vines, the goods of charity and the goods of faith (but of these elsewhere).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Hebrew has "Helbon.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 376 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>376. Hactenus ostensum est quod "oleum" significet bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum; nunc etiam ostendetur quod "vinum" significet bonum spirituale, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum et bonum fidei; et quia hoc bonum in sua essentia est verum, ideo in communi explicatione dictum est quod "oleum et vinum ne laeseris" significet quod non damnum inferendum sit sensui interno seu spirituali Verbi nec quoad bonum nec quoad verum; seu quod idem, quod non damnum inferendum sit bonis et veris quae in sensu interno seu spirituali Verbi. Quod bonum charitatis et bonum fidei in sua essentia sit verum, est quia id bonum implantatur a Domino parti intellectuali hominis per vera quae fidei vocantur; et cum homo vivit secundum illa tunc vera illa fiunt bona, nam per vera in illa parte formatur nova voluntas, et quicquid ex voluntate procedit hoc vocatur bonum. Haec voluntas etiam eadem est cum conscientia; et conscientia est conscientia veri quia formatur per vera omnis generis, quae ex doctrina ecclesiae et ex Verbi sensu litterae (sed de hac re videantur plura in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_376/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_130" target=_top>130-138</a>; et (in collectis) ex Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_376/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_139" target=_top>139-141</a>).<p>[2] Inde nunc est quod per "vinum" significetur verum. Praeterea sunt bona et vera interna et externa; bona et vera interna significantur per "oleum et vinum" quae non laedenda sunt; at bona et vera externa significantur per "triticum et hordeum." Bona et vera externa sunt quae in sensu litterae Verbi sunt, at bona et vera interna sunt quae in sensu interno seu spirituali Verbi sunt; seu bona et vera externa sunt qualia in inferioribus caelis apud angelos ibi, nempe in ultimis caeli; at bona et vera interna sunt qualia in caelis superioribus apud angelos ibi, nempe in tertio et secundo; haec bona et vera sunt ipsa bona et vera genuina, at illa sunt vera et bona quia correspondent, ita correspondentiae; illa communicationem immediatam habent cum angelis caeli, haec autem non immediatam sed mediatam per correspondentias. Inde est quod Judaei, quia solum in sensu litterae fuerunt, et non in cognitione de significatione rerum in sensu spirituali, non potuerint damnum inferre sensui spirituali ejus, nec quoad bonum nec quoad verum, consequenter nec genuinis bonis et veris: similiter Ecclesia Christiana hodie nec potuit damnum inferre bonis et veris genuinis quae sunt in sensu spirituali Verbi, nam ignoravit eum sensum, et cum illo etiam ignoravit genuina bona et vera.<p>[3] Quod Christianis non detectus fuerit sensus spiritualis Verbi, est causa quia genuina bona et vera, qualia sunt in caelis superioribus, latent in sensu Verbi Spirituali; et quamdiu illa bona et vera non percepta et nota fuerunt nec potuit ille sensus aperiri, non enim videri potuerunt: quod genuina bona et vera in Christianis Ecclesiis non percepta et nota fuerint, est causa quia Ecclesiae illae divisae fuerunt, in genere in Pontificiam et in Evangelicam; et in Pontificia prorsus ignorantur vera, quia illi qui in illa non pendent ex Verbo, ita ex Domino qui est Verbum, hoc est Divinum Verum, Sed ex Pontifice, ex cujus ore vix aliquid procedit nisi quod est ex amore imperandi, et is amor est ex inferno; quare etiam vix unum verum, quod est ecclesiae, apud illos datur; in Evangelicis autem Ecclesiis est sola fides assumpta pro essentiali medio salutis, et per id est bonum amoris et charitatis rejectum sicut non essentiale, et ubi bonum est rejectum, ibi nec dari potest aliquod verum quod in se est verum; omne enim verum est ex bono, nam influit Dominus in bonum hominis, et per bonum illustrat eum, et dat lucem ut percipiat vera; quare absque illa luce, quae est ipsa vita spiritualis hominis, non est verum, utcunque sonat ut verum quia ex Verbo; est verum falsificatum per ideas quas de eo habet; nam ex fide separata a charitate, seu ex veris absque bono, non aliud resultat. Inde nunc est quod Ecclesiis Christianis non patefieri potuerit sensus spiritualis Verbi; nam Si patefactus, falsificavissent et pervertissent illum per ideas ex fallaciis, et sic profanavissent. Inde quoque est quod nusquam aliquis, etiam posthac, admittatur in sensum spiritualem Verbi, nisi in genuinis veris ex bono sit; et nullus in genuinis veris ex bono esse potest nisi corde agnoscat solum Dominum pro Deo caeli et terrae, ab Ipso enim est omne bonum et inde verum. Quod sensus spiritualis Verbi hodie patefactus sit, et cum illo etiam genuina vera et bona detecta, est causa quia ultimum judicium a Domino peractum est, et sic omnia in caelis et in infernis in ordinem redacta sunt; et per id provideri a Domino potest ne genuinis veris et bonis, quae in sensu spirituali Verbi sunt, aliquod damnum inferatur, quod prius non potuit (videatur in opusculo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_376/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_73" target=_top>De Ultimo Judicio 73</a>).<p>[4] Quod "vinum" significet bonum spirituale, seu bonum charitatis et bonum fidei, quod in sua essentia est verum, constare potest ex sequentibus locis in Verbo:<p>Apud Esaiam,<p>"Omnis sitiens ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite, emite, et comedite emite sine argento et sine pretio vinum et lac" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_376/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_55_1" target=_top>55:1</a>):<p>quod hic non vinum et lac, quae sine argento emerent, intelligantur, quisque videre potest: quare per "vinum et lac" significantur spiritualia, nempe per "vinum" spirituale bonum, quod in sua essentia est verum, ut supra dictum est, per "lac" autem bonum illius veri; quod illa gratis dentur a Domino illis qui in ignorantia veri et boni sunt, et tamen in desiderio illorum, significatur per "cui non argentum, ite, emite, et comedite; emite sine argento"; "emere" significat sibi comparare, et "comedere" sibi appropriare, quod fit per applicationem sicut ex se; quod illi qui in ignorantia veri et boni et usque in desiderio illorum sunt, intelligantur, patet, nam dicitur "Omnis sitiens ite ad aquas"; "sitire" significat desiderare, et "aquae" significant vera, hic Verbum ubi sunt.<p>[5] Apud Joelem,<p>"Fiet in die illo, stillabunt montes mustum, et colles fluent lacte, omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis" (4 [B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_376/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_18" target=_top>3:18</a>) 18):<p>agitur ibi de adventu Domini, et de novo caelo et nova ecclesia ab Ipso; quod tunc non in terra Canaane seu in Judaea montes stillaverint mustum, nec colles fluxerint lacte, et quod nec tunc prae tempore priori rivi Jehudae fluxerint aquis, notum est; quare per illa verba intelliguntur alia quam mustum, lac et aquae, tum quam montes, colles, rivi; nempe quod per "montes stillabunt mustum" seu vinum, intelligitur quod ex bono amoris in Dominum omne genuinum verum; per quod "colles fluent lacte" intelligitur quod ex bono charitatis erga proximum vita spiritualis; et per quod "omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis" intelligitur quod ex singulis Verbi vera.
