<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1028</h4><p>1028. For the plague thereof was exceeding great. That this signifies the total destruction of genuine truth, is evident from the signification of the plague of the hail, as denoting the falsification of the Word, according to what was said above. Hence by the plague thereof being exceeding great is signified a more grievous falsification, which is, that the Word is falsified, even to the destruction of all genuine truth. How the Word is falsified even to the destruction of genuine truth, and heaven thereby closed against man, may be seen (n. <a href="../ae/719.htm">719</a>, <a href="../ae/778.htm">778</a>, <a href="../ae/888.htm">888</a>, <a href="../ae/914.htm">914</a>, <a href="../ae/916.htm">916</a>, <a href="../ae/950.htm">950</a>).<p>Concerning the Precepts of the Decalogue in general:-</p><p>[2] It is said by some, that he who sins against one precept of the Decalogue sins also against the rest, thus that he who is guilty of one is guilty of all. But how this agrees with the truth shall be explained. He who transgresses one precept, by assuring himself that it is not a sin, and thus commits it without fear of God, rejects the fear of God, because he is not afraid to transgress the rest of the precepts, although he may not do so in act.</p><p>[3] As, for example, whoever does not account frauds and illicit gains, which in themselves are thefts, as sins, neither regards as sins the committing of adultery with the wife of another, the hating of a man even to murder, the lying against him, the coveting his house, and other things belonging to him. For he denies that anything is a sin, when in one precept he casts out the fear of God from his heart. Hence he is in communion with those who similarly transgress the rest of the precepts. He is as an infernal spirit who is in the hell of thieves; and although he is not an adulterer, a murderer, or a false witness, yet he is in communion with such, and may be persuaded by them to believe that such things are not evils, and may also be led to commit them. For he who becomes an infernal spirit by the transgression of one precept, no longer believes it to be a sin to do anything against God, or anything against his neighbour.</p><p>[4] But the contrary is the case with those who abstain from the evil of one precept, and shun, and afterwards turn away from it, as a sin against God. Because such fear God, they come into communion with the angels of heaven, and are led by the Lord to abstain from the evils of the other precepts, and to shun them, and at length to turn away from them as sins. And if they happen to have sinned against them, still they repent, and thus by degrees are withdrawn from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 1028</h4><p>1028. For the plague thereof was exceeding great, signifies the total destruction of genuine truth. This is evident from the signification of "the plague of the hail," as being the falsification of the Word (as above); therefore "the plague thereof was exceeding great" signifies more grievous falsification, which is that the Word is falsified even to the destruction of all genuine truth. How the Word is falsified even to the destruction of genuine truth, and heaven is thereby closed against man, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/719.htm">719</a>, <a href="../ae/778.htm">778</a>, <a href="../ae/888.htm">888</a>, <a href="../ae/914.htm">914</a>, <a href="../ae/916.htm">916</a>, <a href="../ae/950.htm">950</a>).<p>(Continuation: The Commandments in general)</p><p>[2] It is said by some that he who sins against one commandment of the Decalogue sins also against the rest, thus that he who is guilty of one is guilty of all. It shall be told how far this is in harmony with the truth. When a man transgresses one commandment, by confirming with himself that it is not a sin, thus without fear of God, he commits it; because he has thus rejected the fear of God he does not fear to transgress the rest of the commandments, although he may not do this in act.</p><p>[3] For example, when one does not regard frauds and illicit gains, which in themselves are thefts, as sins, neither does he regard as a sin adultery with the wife of another, hating a man even to murder, lying about him, coveting his house and other things belonging to him; for when he rejects from his heart in any one commandment the fear of God he denies that anything is a sin; consequently he is in communion with those who in like manner transgress the other commandments. He is like an infernal spirit who is in a hell of thieves; and although he is not an adulterer, nor a murderer, nor a false witness, yet he is in communion with such, and can be persuaded by them to believe that such things are not evils, and can be led to do them. For he who has become an infernal spirit through the transgression of one commandment, no longer believes it to be a sin to do anything against God or anything against the neighbor.</p><p>[4] But the opposite is true of those who abstain from the evil forbidden in one commandment, and who shun and afterwards turn away from it as a sin against God. Because such fear God, they come into communion with the angels of heaven, and are led by the Lord to abstain from the evils forbidden in the other commandments and to shun them, and finally to turn away from them as sins; and if perchance they have sinned against them, yet they repent and thus by degrees are withdrawn from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 1028 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>1028. "Quia magna erat plaga ejus valde." - Quod significet destructionem genuini veri totalem, constat ex significatione "plagae grandinis", quod sit falsificatio Verbi (de qua mox supra): inde per quod "magna erat plaga ejus valde", significatur gravior falsificatio, quae est, quod Verbum falsificatum sit usque ad destructionem omnis genuini Veri. Quomodo Verbum usque ad destructionem genuini Veri falsificatur, et quod caelum per id praecludatur homini, videatur (supra) (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1028/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_719" target=_top>719</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1028/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_778" target=_top>778</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1028/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_888" target=_top>888</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1028/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_914" target=_top>914</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1028/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_916" target=_top>916</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_1028/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_950" target=_top>950</a>).<p>[2] (De Praeceptis Decalogi in genere.)<p>Dicitur a quibusdam quod qui contra unum praeceptum decalogi peccat etiam contra reliqua peccet, ita quod reus sit omnium qui est reus unius; sed quomodo hoc cum veritate cohaeret, dicetur. Qui transcendit unum praeceptum, confirmando apud se quod hoc non sit peccatum, et sic absque timore Dei id committit, is quia rejecit timorem Dei, nec timet transcendere praecepta reliqua, tametsi non actualiter illa transcendit.<p>[3] Ut pro exemplo: qui fraudes et illicitas lucrationes, quae in se sunt furta, non pro peccatis reputat, is nec pro peccatis reputat adulterari cum uxore alterius, hominem odio habere usque ad necem, mentiri in illum, concupiscere domum ejus, et plura quae ejus sunt; negat enim quod aliquid sit peccatum, dum in uno praecepto rejicit e corde timorem Dei; inde in communione est cum illis qui reliqua praecepta similiter transcendunt: est sicut infernalis spiritus, qui in inferno furum est; is tametsi non est adulter, nec homicida, nec falsus testis, usque in communione est cum illis, et potest ab illis persuaderi ad credendum quod non mala sint, et quoque adduci ad faciendum illa; nam qui infernalis spiritus per transgressionem unius praecepti factus est, is amplius non credit peccatum esse facere aliquid contra Deum, nec facere aliquid contra proximum.<p>[4] Contrarium fit illis qui abstinent a malo unius praecepti, et illud ut peccatum contra Deum fugiunt et dein aversantur; ii, quia timent Deum, in communionem veniunt cum angelis caeli, ac ducuntur a Domino ad abstinendum a malis reliquorum praeceptorum, et ad fugiendum illa, et tandem ad aversandum illa, ut peccata; et si forte peccaverint contra illa, usque paenitentiam agunt, et sic per gradus abducuntur ab illis. </p>
