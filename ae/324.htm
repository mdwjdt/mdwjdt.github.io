<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 324</h4><p>324. And golden vials full of incense. That this signifies confession from spiritual goods, is evident from the signification of golden vials which are also called censers, as denoting truths from good; for vials, like all containing vessels, signify truths, and the gold of which they were made signifies good, hence golden vials denote truths from good (that vessels signify truths because they serve good for recipient and containing vessels, may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3079.htm">3079</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3316.htm">3316</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3318.htm">3318</a>; and also the vessels of the altars, of the burnt-offering, and the incense, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9723.htm">9723</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9724.htm">9724</a>; and that gold signifies good, see above, n. <a href="../ae/242.htm">242</a>); and from the signification of incense, as denoting those things of worship that are done from spiritual good, or from the good of charity, and thence are pleasurably perceived. Such things are signified by incense, because all things instituted in the Israelitish nation were representative of celestial and spiritual things, whence also odorous things, which were of a pleasant smell, represented pleasant perception, but those of an unpleasant smell, an unpleasant perception. It was on this account that incense was made of fragrant spices, with myrrh, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense. Moreover, there is a correspondence of odour with perception, which is evident from this fact, that in the spiritual world, where all things perceived by the senses are correspondences, the perceptivity of good and truth is perceived by the senses as fragrance from pleasant smells, and vice versa (concerning which fact see what is shown from experience in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1514.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1514</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1517.htm">1517-1519</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1631.htm">1631</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4626.htm">4626</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4628.htm">4628</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4630.htm">4630</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4631.htm">4631</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5711.htm">5711-5717</a>). Hence it is, that, in common discourse, to smell signifies to perceive; for such expressions, and many others, came into human speech from correspondence; for a man's spirit is actually in the spiritual world, although a man does not know it. Also a man's perceptive faculty is the cause of his bodily sense of smell, and this also is from correspondence. But this is an arcanum which is believed with difficulty, because hitherto unknown. It should be known that the good of love and of charity produces that sweet smelling or fragrance, but by truth, but not from itself without truth, still less by truth which is called that of faith without good; for good without truth has nothing perceptive, neither has truth without good.</p><p>[2] Incense signifies those things of worship which are done from spiritual good, because spiritual good derives its origin and existence from celestial good, and this good is the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and hence it is the very good of heaven. For that good is directly from the Lord, and the Lord is in that good with the angels as in His own, even to such a degree that whether you say that the Lord is in them, and they in the Lord, or you say that the Lord is with them in that good, and they in the Lord when in that good, it is the same thing. Spiritual good, which derives its origin and existence from celestial good, is the good of charity towards the neighbour;<p>the worship from this good is signified by incense. Because all worship of the Lord is effected from good, although by means of truths, and because there are two universal goods that make the heavens, and distinguish them into two kingdoms, namely celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour, therefore with the children of Israel there were two altars, one for the burnt-offerings, the other for the incense; and by the altar of burnt-offering was signified worship from the good of celestial love, and by the altar of incense, worship from the good of spiritual love; hence it is evident what was represented by incense.</p><p>[3] That this is the case is evident from the passages in the Word where it is mentioned. As in Moses:<p>"Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon; and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and thou shalt put it before the veil that is upon the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat. And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of spices every morning; in trimming the lamps he shall burn it, and in making the lamps to ascend at even he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations. Ye shall make no strange incense to ascend thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat-offering, nor drink-offering" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9457.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9457</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9485.htm">9485</a>, concerning the tent, where was the table upon which was the bread of faces, also where the altar of incense and the candlestick were; and from what is shown concerning the ark, in which was the testimony, and upon which was the mercy-seat (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9485.htm">9485</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10545.htm">10545</a>). Hence it is clear, that by the things that were in the tent without the veil, namely, the candlestick, the altar of incense, the table for the bread, were signified such things as pertain to the spiritual kingdom, all which have reference to spiritual good, and to its truth. By the table, upon which was the bread of faces, was signified the reception of celestial good in spiritual good (as may be seen, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9527.htm">9527</a>). By the candlestick with the lamps was signified the Spiritual itself of that kingdom (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9551.htm">9551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9556.htm">9556</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9561.htm">9561</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9572.htm">9572</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9783.htm">9783</a>). And by the altar of incense was signified worship from spiritual good; and because worship from spiritual good was signified by the burning of incense upon that altar, and by the candlestick the Spiritual itself, therefore it was commanded that Aaron should burn the incense upon it every morning and evening, when he trimmed the lamps; but these things are more fully explained in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10176.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10176-10213</a>, where they are treated of as to each particular.</p><p>[4] Because spiritual good derives its origin and existence from celestial good, as has been said above, therefore that altar was not only placed near the veil which was upon the ark, but it was also commanded that when Aaron should make atonement for himself and for his house, he should bring the incense within the veil, by which is signified the influx, communication, and conjunction of celestial good and spiritual good. Concerning this it is thus written in Moses:<p>"And Aaron shall make an atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering; and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of incense of spices, and he shall bring it within the veil, so that he may put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah; and the cloud of the incense shall cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not " (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4489.htm">4489</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9714.htm">9714</a>, and elsewhere). On this account it was that the fire for burning the incense was taken only from the altar of burnt-offering. The reason why Aaron, when he made atonement for himself and his house, burned the incense within the veil, was, because Aaron as chief priest represented the Lord as to the good of love, and by his functions he represented those things that proceed from that good, all of which have reference to spiritual good. Unless spiritual good is from celestial good, it is not good, therefore neither would its function be from the Divine, nor would it represent anything of the Divine; therefore death was threatened to him unless he did so.</p><p>[5] This is why Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, were consumed by fire from heaven, because they burnt incense from other fire than the fire of the altar of burnt-offering, consequently they performed worship from another love than that of love to the Lord. Concerning this circumstance, it is thus written in Moses:<p>"Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer and put strange fire therein, and put incense thereon; therefore fire went out from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died, and afterwards they were borne out of the camp" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4236.htm">4236</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10038.htm">10038</a>).</p><p>[6] The reason why Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company, were swallowed up by the earth, although they took the fire from the altar and burnt incense, was, because by their murmuring against Moses and Aaron profanation of the good of celestial love was signified; for Moses and Aaron represented the Lord; and to murmur, that is, to rebel against the Lord, and engage in holy offices, is profanation; but because they took the fire from the altar, that fire was cast out and their censers were made into a covering for the altar. Concerning this fact, it is thus written:<p>"Moses said unto them that they should take fire, and put it into their censers; which also was done, but they were swallowed up" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_1.htm">Num. 16:1</a> to end).<p>But afterwards it was commanded<p>"That they should collect the censers, and scatter the fire towards this place; and of the censers which were of brass, they should make broad plates, a covering to the altar, because they were hallowed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_37.htm">Num. 16:37</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_38.htm">38</a>).<p>They were sanctified by the fire of the altar, which signified Divine celestial love.</p><p>[7] Because spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour, derives its essence and soul from celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, therefore also the frankincense, by which spiritual good is signified, was put upon the bread of faces, by which was signified celestial good; as is evident from these words in Moses:<p>"Frankincense shall also be put upon the bread of faces, which is upon the table in the tent of the assembly, that the bread may be for a memorial" (<a href="../hh/390.htm">Heaven and Hell 390</a>, <a href="../hh/484.htm">484</a>, <a href="../hh/529.htm">529</a>, <a href="../hh/530.htm">530-535</a>, and the <a href="../njhd/84.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 84-107</a>). This therefore is spiritual good; and celestial good is to look to the Lord, and [to acknowledge] that all good and truth are from Him, and that from man, or his proprium, there is nothing, but evil.</p><p>[8] That the incense was burned from no other fire than that of the altar of burnt-offering, by which was signified celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, appears also from other passages; as in Moses<p>"When the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, and they were attacked by the plague, then Aaron took fire from the altar, and [put it] in a censer, and put incense in it, and he ran into the midst of them; and the plague was stayed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_41.htm">Num. 16:41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_46.htm">46-48</a>, and also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_3.htm">Rev. 8:3-5</a>).</p><p>[9] That incense and frankincense signify spiritual good, and the burning thereof the worship that is grateful from that good, and therefore hearing and reception by the Lord, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>"A troop of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense; and they shall show forth the praises of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1171.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1171</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3240.htm">3240</a>). By the gold and frankincense which they shall bring, is signified worship from spiritual good, that is from celestial good; gold signifying celestial good, and frankincense spiritual good. Because worship from these is signified, it is therefore said, "and they shall show forth the praises of Jehovah"; by showing forth the praises of Jehovah is signified the preaching of the gospel concerning the Lord, and the worship of Him.</p><p>[10] In Matthew:<p>The wise men from the east opened their treasures, and presented to the new-born Lord gifts, "gold, frankincense, and myrrh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3249.htm">3249</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3762.htm">3762</a>), for knowledge of correspondences still remained with them; wherefore that they might testify the joy of their heart, they offered such things as signified every good from first to last; and this is what was prophesied in Isaiah, that they should come from Sheba and bring gold and frankincense, and show forth the praises of Jehovah, concerning which we have treated just above.</p><p>[11] In Malachi:<p>"From the rising of the sun even unto the setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a clean meat-offering" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10079.htm">10079</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10137.htm">10137</a>.)</p><p>[12] The same is signified by incense and meat-offering in David:<p>"Give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. Let my prayers be accepted as incense before thee; and the lifting up of my hands as the meat-offering of the evening" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_141_1.htm">Ps 141:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_141_2.htm">2</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"Thou hast not brought to me the cattle of thy burnt-offerings, and thou hast not honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not made thee to serve by a meat-offering, nor wearied thee by frankincense" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_23.htm">43:23</a>).<p>Because all worship of the Lord is done from spiritual good, which is from celestial good, therefore both the meat-offering and frankincense are mentioned in the letter separately, which, notwithstanding, in the internal or spiritual sense are conjointly understood, but the one from the other.</p><p>[13] Similarly in Jeremiah:<p>"They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the circuits of Jerusalem, bringing burnt-offering and sacrifice, and meat-offering and frankincense" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_17_26.htm">17:26</a>).<p>By Judah and Jerusalem here are not meant Judah and Jerusalem, but the Lord's church which is in the good of love and in the doctrine of charity therefrom, worship from these is signified by burnt-offering and sacrifice, also by meat-offering and frankincense.</p><p>[14] Because meat-offering signified the good of celestial love, and frankincense the good of spiritual love, therefore upon the meat-offering of fine flour were put oil and frankincense; as appears in Moses:<p>"When the soul willeth to offer a gift of meat-offering unto Jehovah, fine flour shall be the gift thereof, upon which he shall pour oil, and shall put upon it frankincense; and the priest shall take a handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, together with all the frankincense thereof, and he shall burn it for a memorial upon the altar" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_2_1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_2_2.htm">2</a>).<p>The reason why this meat-offering was instituted, was, because fine flour signifies genuine truth (as may be seen, n. 9995), because this is from good, namely, from celestial good, and thence from spiritual good, therefore oil and frankincense were put upon it; oil signifying the good of celestial love, and frankincense the good of spiritual love; in the internal sense, the one from the other. There were also other kinds of meat-offering, which were prepared with oil, by which similar things were signified.</p><p>[15] In Ezekiel:<p>"Thou hast taken the garments of thy embroidery, and hast covered images of a male, with which thou didst commit whoredom; and my oil and my incense thou hast given before them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_18.htm">16:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_19.htm">19</a>).<p>These things are said concerning Jerusalem, which signifies the church as to doctrine, here as to doctrine entirely perverted. The images of a male which she covered with the garments of her embroidery, and with which she committed whoredom, signify the falsities which, by perverse interpretation, they made to appear as truths, thus falsified truths. Embroidered garments denote the knowledges of truth from the Word; and to commit whoredom denotes to falsify. To give my oil and my incense before them, signifies to adulterate both the good of celestial love and the good of spiritual love, which are adulterated when the Word is applied to the loves of self and of the world.</p><p>[16] In Moses:<p>"They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense to thy nose, and burnt sacrifice upon thine altar" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p>This is the prophecy of Moses concerning Levi, by whom is signified the priesthood. And because the priesthood was representative of the Lord as to the good of love, both celestial and spiritual, therefore it is said, "they shall put incense to thy nose, and burnt sacrifice upon thine altar." By incense is signified worship from spiritual good, and by the burnt sacrifice upon the altar is signified worship from celestial good; to the nose, signifies, to the perception.</p><p>[17] In David:<p>"I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay my vows unto thee. I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, rams together with incense" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_13.htm">Psalms 66:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_15.htm">15</a>).<p>To offer burnt-offerings of fatlings, signifies worship from the good of celestial love; to offer rams together with incense, signifies worship from the good of spiritual love; incense and also a ram signify that good.</p><p>[18] In the Apocalypse:<p>"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, ascended up out of the angel's hand to the sight of God. Afterwards, the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_3.htm">Revelation 8:3-5</a>).<p>The signification of these things will be stated in the explanation of those words in the following [verses]; here only that, incense signifies worship from spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour. That worship is also signified by the prayers of the saints; therefore it is said, "there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with the prayers of the saints"; and after that, the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, ascended up in the sight of God. That the prayers of the saints signify worship from spiritual good, will be seen in the article immediately following, likewise what is meant by worship from spiritual good or from the good of charity.</p><p>[19] In Isaiah:<p>"A people that provoke me to anger continually before my faces; that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon the sides " (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4552.htm">4552</a>.</p><p>[20] In Hosea:<p>"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under the oak, and the poplar, and the elm, because the shadow thereof is good; therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_13.htm">4:13</a>).<p>By these words is described worship from the love of self and from the love of the world, and thence from falsities of doctrine; worship from the love of self, by sacrificing upon the tops of the mountains; worship from the love of the world, by burning incense upon the hills; and worship from falsities of doctrine, by sacrificing and burning incense under the oak, the poplar, and the elm. The top of the mountains signifies celestial love, here the love of self; hills signify spiritual love, here the love of the world; for the love of self is the opposite of celestial love, and the love of the world is the opposite of spiritual love. The oak, the poplar, and the elm, signify the lowest goods of truth and truths of good of the natural man, here his evils of falsity and falsities of evil. "Because the shadow thereof is good," signifies complacence; the falsifications of spiritual good thence are signified by, "therefore your daughters commit whoredom," and the adulteration of celestial good by, "therefore your daughters-in-law commit adultery."</p><p>[21] In Jeremiah:<p>"The number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and even as the number [of the streets] of Jerusalem have ye set up altars, altars to burn incense unto Baal" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_13.htm">11:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_17.htm">17</a>).<p>By cities here are not signified cities, nor by gods, gods, neither by the streets of Jerusalem streets there; but by cities are signified the doctrinals of falsity by gods, the falsities themselves; and by the streets of Jerusalem, the falsities of the doctrine of the church. By setting up altars, altars to burn incense unto Baal, is signified worship from the love of self and from the love of the world (as above). This nation did set up altars, and burn incense to Baal; but because all things of their worship were representative, those things which were done according to the statutes were representative of things celestial and spiritual; therefore those things which were done contrary to the statutes were representative of infernal things; consequently, by the altars set up to [their] gods, and by the incense given to Baal, are signified things opposite.</p><p>[22] In the same:<p>"I will speak judgments with them upon all their wickedness, that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and have bowed themselves down to the works of their own hands" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_1_16.htm">1:16</a>).<p>To burn incense to other gods, and to bow themselves down to the works of their own hands, signify worship from falsities which are from man's own intelligence; other gods denoting falsities, and the works of [their own] hands denoting the things that are from man's own intelligence.</p><p>[23] The same is signified by burning incense to gods, in Jeremiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_12.htm">11:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_3.htm">44:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_18.htm">18</a>); also by burning incense to graven images, in Hosea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_11_2.htm">11:2</a>); and by burning incense to vanity, in Jeremiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_15.htm">18:15</a>). The same also as above by burning incense to Baal, in Jeremiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">7:9</a>); and in Hosea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_2_13.htm">2:13</a>); and in like manner by burning incense to Melecheth or the queen of the heavens, in Jeremiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">44:17-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_25.htm">25</a>). Melecheth of the heavens signifies falsities in the aggregate.</p><p>[24] Further, the burning of incense signifies those things of worship which are perceived as grateful, and incense spiritual good, because all things that were instituted in the Israelitish nation were representative of celestial and spiritual things; for the church with them was not internal, as the church at this day, but external; and externals represented and thence signified the internals of the church, such as were unfolded by the Lord in the Word of the New Testament; hence their church was called a representative church. The externals of this church consisted of such things in the world of nature as corresponded to the affections of good and truth in the spiritual world; hence it was that when those who belonged to that church were in externals as to worship, those who were in the spiritual world or in heaven, were in internals, and conjoined themselves with those who were in externals; in this manner, at that time, heaven made one with the men of the earth.</p><p>[25] From these things it is evident why there was a table in the tent of the assembly for the bread, why there was the candlestick with the lamps, and the altar of incense. For the bread represented, and thence signified, the good of love proceeding from the Lord, or celestial good, the candlestick with the lamps represented, and thence signified, spiritual good and truth; and the incense represented, and thence signified, worship; and because all Divine worship that is gratefully perceived is from spiritual good, therefore that good was signified by the incense. In order that what is grateful might be represented, the incense was made from fragrant spices, and this also from correspondence; for fragrant odours correspond to the pleasures and delights that inhere in the thoughts and perceptions from the delight of spiritual love, consequently, the incense corresponded to such things as are gratefully received by the Lord, and as are perceived gratefully by the angels. This grateful quality is entirely from spiritual good, or from the good of charity towards the neighbour; for this good is celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord in effect, for celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, is fixed in effect solely by spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour; therefore to be in this good and to exercise it, is to love and worship the Lord. The nature of charity towards the neighbour, and its exercise, may be seen in the <a href="../njhd/84.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 84-107</a>.</p><p>[26] Because the oil by which anointings were performed signified celestial good, or the good of love to the Lord, and the incense signified spiritual good, or the good of charity towards the neighbour, and because the latter is from the former (as has been said above), therefore in Exodus (xxx.) the preparation of the anointing oil is first treated of, and the preparation of the incense immediately afterwards; the preparation of the anointing oil from verse 23-33, and the preparation of the incense from verse 34-38. And as incense is here treated of, I will here adduce what is there commanded concerning the preparation of the incense, namely:<p>"Take unto thee fragrant spices, myrrh, onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices, with pure frankincense, shall be of equal weight. And thou shalt make it a perfume, an unguent the work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy; and thou shalt beat of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the assembly, where I will meet thee; it shall be unto you the holy of holies. And the perfume which thou makest unto yourselves ye shall not make after the quality thereof; it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah. The man who shall make like unto that, to make an odour to him, shall be cut off from his people" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>).<p>But what each of these particulars signifies may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_23.htm">Exodus 30:23-33</a>). Hence it is evident why frankincense signifies the same as incense in the compound, namely, spiritual good.</p><p>[27] Because the fragrances belonging to odour correspond to spiritual pleasantnesses, or to the pleasantnesses arising from spiritual good, therefore also the most grateful reception by the Lord is called an odour of rest (<a href="../ae/288.htm">288</a>). (That the olive also signifies that good, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9277.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9277</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10261.htm">10261</a>; that odour signifies the perceptive faculty of what is grateful according to the quality of love and faith, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1514.htm">1514-1519</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3577.htm">3577</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4624.htm">4624-4634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4748.htm">4748</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5621.htm">5621</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10292.htm">10292</a>; that an odour of rest signifies the perceptive faculty of peace, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/925.htm">925</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10054.htm">10054</a>; the nature of the perceptive faculty of peace may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/284.htm">Heaven and Hell 284-290</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 324</h4><p>324. And golden bowls full of incense, signifies confession from spiritual goods. This is evident from the signification of "golden bowls," which are also called "censers," and "incense pans," as being truths from good; for "bowls," like all containing vessels, signify truths, and "gold," of which they were made, signifies good, therefore "golden bowls" are truths from good. (That "vessels" signify truths, because truths serve good as recipient and containing vessels, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3068.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3068</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3079.htm">3079</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3316.htm">3316</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3318.htm">3318</a>; also "the vessels of the altars," "of burnt offering," and "of incense," n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9723.htm">9723</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9724.htm">9724</a>; and that "gold" signifies good, above, n. <a href="../ae/242.htm">242</a> It is evident also from the signification of "incense," as being those things of worship that are done from spiritual good, or from the good of charity, and are therefore gratefully perceived. Such things are signified by "incense," because all things that are instituted in the Israelitish nation were representative of celestial and spiritual things; so also were the things relating to odor; things of pleasant odor represented pleasant perception, but those of unpleasant odor unpleasant perception. On this account incense was made of fragrant spices, myrrh, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense. Moreover, there is a correspondence between odor and perception, as can be seen from this, that in the spiritual world, where all things perceived by the senses correspond, the perceptive of good and truth is made sensible as fragrance from pleasant odors, and vice versa (respecting this see what is shown from experience, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1514.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1514</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1517.htm">1517-1519</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1631.htm">1631</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4626.htm">4626</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4628.htm">4628</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4630.htm">4630</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4631.htm">4631</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5711.htm">5711-5717</a>). From this it is that also in the common language of men, to smell means to perceive; for such expressions, like many others, have come into human discourse from correspondence; for the spirit of man is actually in the spiritual world, although man is not conscious of it. Moreover, the faculty of perception that man has, is what produces in his body the sense of smell, and this too from correspondence. But this is an arcanum that can with difficulty be credited, because it has been hitherto unknown. It is to be noted that this sweet smell or fragrance is produced by the good of love and charity, but by means of truth, not by good itself without truth, still less by means of the truth that is called truth of faith without good; for good without truth has nothing perceptive, neither has truth without good.</p><p>[2] "Incense" signifies those things of worship that are done from spiritual good, because spiritual good has its origin and existence from celestial good, which good is the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and is therefore the very good of heaven, for that good is immediately from the Lord, and the Lord is with angels in that good as in what is His. This is even so far true that whether you say that the Lord is in them and they in the Lord, or that the Lord is with them in that good and they are in the Lord when in that good, it is the same. Spiritual good, which has its origin and existence from celestial good, is the good of charity towards the neighbor; worship from this good is what is signified by "incense." As all worship of the Lord comes from good, although through truths, and as there are two universal goods that make the heavens and distinguish them into two kingdoms, namely, celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, therefore with the sons of Israel there were two altars, one for burnt offerings, the other for incense-offerings; the altar of burnt offering signifying worship from the good of celestial love, and the altar of incense worship from the good of spiritual love; thence it is clear what was represented by "incense."</p><p>[3] That this is so can be seen from passages in the Word where the two are mentioned. As in Moses:<p>Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon; and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and thou shalt put it before the veil that is over the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy-seat. And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of spices every morning, when dressing the lamps he shall burn it, and in making the lamps to ascend between the evenings he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah in your generations. Ye shall make no strange incense to ascend thereon, nor burnt-sacrifice, nor meal-offering, nor drink-offering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9457.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9457</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9485.htm">9485</a>) respecting the tent, in which was the table for the bread of faces, and in which was the altar of incense and the lampstand, also respecting the ark, in which was the Testimony, and upon which was the mercy-seat (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9485.htm">9485</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10545.htm">10545</a>). It is there shown that the things that were in the tent without the veil, namely, the lamp stand, the altar of incense, and the table for the bread, signified such things as are of the spiritual kingdom, all of which have reference to spiritual good and its truth. The "table, upon which was the bread of faces," signified the reception of celestial good in spiritual good (See n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9527.htm">9527</a>); the "lampstand" with the "lamps" signified the spiritual itself of that kingdom (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9551.htm">9551</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9556.htm">9556</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9561.htm">9561</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9572.htm">9572</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9783.htm">9783</a>); the "altar of incense" signified worship from spiritual good; and because worship from spiritual good was signified by burning incense upon that altar, and the spiritual itself by the "lampstand," it was commanded that Aaron should burn incense upon it every morning and evening, when he dressed the lamps. (But these things are more fully explained in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10176.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10176-10213</a>, where these particulars are treated of.)</p><p>[4] And because spiritual good has its origin and existence from celestial good (as was said above), not only was that altar placed near the veil that was over the ark, but it was also commanded that when Aaron should make atonement for himself and for his house, he should bring the incense within the veil, which signified the influx, communication, and conjunction of celestial good and spiritual good. Of this it is written in Moses:<p>When Aaron shall make an atonement for himself and for his house he shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering; and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of the incense of spices, and he shall bring it within the veil, that he may put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah; and the cloud of the incense shall cover the mercy-seat that is upon the Testimony, that he die not (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4489.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4489</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9714.htm">9714</a>, and elsewhere). This is why the fire for burning incense was not taken from anywhere else than from the altar of burnt-offering. When Aaron made atonement for himself and his house he was to burn the incense within the veil because Aaron as chief priest represented the Lord in respect to the good of love, and by his functions he represented the things that proceed from that good, all of which relate to spiritual good; spiritual good, unless it is from celestial good, is not good; except for this Aaron's function could not have been from the Divine, or could not have represented anything of the Divine; and this is why Aaron was threatened with death unless he did as he was commanded.</p><p>[5] For the same reason also Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, were consumed by fire from heaven because they burnt incense from other fire than the fire of the altar of burnt-offering, which is offering worship from a love other than love to the Lord; respecting which it is thus written in Moses:<p>Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer and put strange fire therein, and laid incense thereon. Therefore fire went out from before Jehovah and devoured them, and they died, afterwards they were carried without the camp (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4236.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4236</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10038.htm">10038</a>).</p><p>[6] Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company, were swallowed up by the earth, although they took fire from the altar and burnt incense, because "their murmuring against Moses and Aaron" signified the profanation of the good of celestial love; for "Moses" and "Aaron" represented the Lord and "to murmur" (that is, to rebel) against the Lord and at the same time to perform holy offices, is profanation; but as they took the fire from the altar, that fire was cast out, and their censers were made into a covering for the altar; respecting which it is thus written in Moses:<p>Moses said to them that they should take fire and put it into their censers which was also done; but they were swallowed up (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_1.htm">Numbers 16</a>).<p>But afterwards it was commanded:<p>That they should gather up the censers, and scatter the fire hitherwards; and of the censers, which were of brass, they should make broad plates, a covering to the altar, because they had been sanctified (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_37.htm">Numbers 16:37-38</a>).<p>The censers had been sanctified by the "fire of the altar," which signified Divine celestial love.</p><p>[7] Because spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, derives its essence and soul from celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, therefore also "frankincense," which signifies spiritual good, was put upon the "bread of faces," which signified celestial good; as can be seen from these words in Moses:<p>And frankincense shall be put upon the bread of faces which is upon the table in the tent of meeting, that the bread may be for a memorial (<a href="../hh/390.htm">Heaven and Hell 390</a>, <a href="../hh/484.htm">484</a>, <a href="../hh/530.htm">530-535</a>; and <a href="../njhd/84.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 84-107</a>), this, therefore, is spiritual good; while celestial good is looking to the Lord and acknowledging that every good and truth is from Him, and that from man, or from what is man's own, there is nothing but evil.</p><p>[8] That the incense was to be burned from no other fire than the fire of the altar of burnt-offering, which signified celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, is also evident from other passages, as in Moses:<p>When the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, and were attacked by the plague, then Aaron took fire from the altar, and put it in a censer, and placed incense on it, and he ran into the midst of them; and the plague was stayed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_41.htm">Numbers 16:41</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_16_46.htm">46-48</a>, and also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_3.htm">Revelation 8:3-5</a>).</p><p>[9] That "incense" and "frankincense" signify spiritual good, and "burning incense" worship acceptable because of that good, and therefore hearing and reception by the Lord, can be seen from the following.<p>In Isaiah:<p>A troop of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and of Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense; and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1171.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1171</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3240.htm">3240</a>); "gold and frankincense," which they shall bring, signify worship from spiritual good that is from celestial good; "gold" signifying celestial good, and "frankincense" spiritual good. Because worship from these is signified it is said, "and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah;" "proclaiming the praises of Jehovah" signifying the proclamation of good tidings respecting the Lord, and worship of Him.</p><p>[10] In Matthew:<p>The wise men from the east opened their treasures, and offered gifts to the newborn Lord, gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3249.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3249</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3762.htm">3762</a>), for the knowledge of correspondences had remained among them; therefore that they might testify their joy of heart they offered such things as signified every good from first to last; and this is what was predicted in Isaiah, that they "were to come from Sheba, and bring gold and frankincense, and proclaim the praises of Jehovah" (of which just above).</p><p>[11] In Malachi:<p>From the rising of the sun even unto its going down My name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a clean meal offering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4581.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4581</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10079.htm">10079</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1.htm">1</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10137.htm">10137</a>)</p><p>[12] "Incense" and "meal-offering" have a like signification in David:<p>Give ear unto my voice when I call unto Thee. Let my prayers be accepted as incense before Thee; the lifting up of my hands as the evening meal-offering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_141_1.htm">Psalms 141:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_141_2.htm">2</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>Thou hast brought to Me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings, and thou hast not honored Me with thy sacrifices. I have not made thee to serve by a meal-offering, nor wearied thee by frankincense (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>).<p>As all worship of the Lord comes from spiritual good that is from celestial good, therefore the two, "meal-offering" and "frankincense" are mentioned separately in the letter, yet in the internal or spiritual sense they are to be understood conjointly, but the one from the other.</p><p>[13] So in Jeremiah:<p>They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the circuits of Jerusalem, bringing burnt-offering and sacrifice, and meal-offering and frankincense (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_17_26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>).<p>Here "Judah" and "Jerusalem" do not mean Judah and Jerusalem, but the Lord's church, which is in the good of love and in the doctrine of charity therefrom; worship from these is signified by "burnt-offering and sacrifice," also by "meal-offering and frankincense."</p><p>[14] Because "meal-offering" signified the good of celestial love, and "frankincense" the good of spiritual love, upon the meal-offering of fine flour were put oil and frankincense, as appears in Moses:<p>When a soul would offer the offering of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, fine flour shall be his offering, upon which he shall pour oil, and shall put upon it frankincense; and the priest shall take out of it his handful of the fine flour and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof, and he shall burn it for a memorial upon the altar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9995.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9995</a>); and since this truth is from good, namely, from celestial good, and from consequent spiritual good, "oil and frankincense" were put upon it; "oil" signifying the good of celestial love, and "frankincense" the good of spiritual love; in the internal sense, the one from the other. There were also other kinds of meal-offerings that were prepared with oil that had a like signification.</p><p>[15] In Ezekiel:<p>Thou hast taken the garments of thy embroidery, and hast covered the images of the male, with which thou didst commit whoredom; and didst set My oil and My incense before them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_16_18.htm">Ezekiel 16:18-19</a>).<p>This is said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church in respect to doctrine, here doctrine altogether perverted. The "images of the male," which "she covered with the garments of her embroidery, and with which she committed whoredom," signify the falsities that they made, by perverse interpretations, to appear as truths, thus they signify falsified truths, "garments of embroidery" meaning the knowledges of truth from the Word, and "to commit whoredom" meaning to falsify; to set My oil and My incense before them" signifies to adulterate both the good of celestial love and the good of spiritual love; and these are adulterated when the Word is applied to the loves of self and of the world.</p><p>[16] In Moses:<p>They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law; they shall put incense in Thy nostrils, and a burnt-offering upon Thine altar (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p>This is the prophecy of Moses respecting Levi, by whom the priesthood is signified, and because the priesthood was representative of the Lord in respect to the good of love, both celestial and spiritual, therefore it is said, "they shall put incense in Thy nostrils, and a burnt-offering upon Thine altar;" "incense" signifying worship from spiritual good, and "burnt offering upon the altar" worship from celestial good; "in the nostrils" signifying to the perception.</p><p>[17] In David:<p>I will go into Thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay my vows unto Thee. I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, rams with incense (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_13.htm">Psalms 66:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_66_15.htm">15</a>).<p>"To offer burnt-offerings of fatlings" signifies worship from the good of celestial love; "to offer rams with incense" signifies worship from the good of spiritual love; "incense" and "ram" signifying that good.</p><p>[18] In Revelation:<p>Another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up out of the angel's hand before God. Afterwards the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it into the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_8_3.htm">Revelation 8:3-5</a>).<p>What this means will be told in the explanation of these words in what follows; here it need merely be said that "incense" signifies worship from spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor. Such worship is signified also by "the prayers of the saints;" it is therefore said "that there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with prayers of the saints;" and then that "the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God." That the "prayers of the saints" signify worship from spiritual good will be seen in the next paragraph, so also what is meant by worship from spiritual good, or from the good of charity.</p><p>[19] In Isaiah:<p>A people that provoke Me to anger continually before My faces; that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon bricks (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4552.htm">4552</a>)</p><p>[20] In Hosea:<p>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under the oak, and the poplar, and the terebinth, because the shadow thereof is good, therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_4_13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>This describes worship from the love of self and from the love of the world, and from the falsities of doctrine therefrom; worship from the love of self is meant by "sacrificing upon the tops of the mountains;" worship from the love of the world, by "burning incense upon the hills;" and worship from the falsities of doctrine, by "sacrificing and burning incense under the oak, the poplar, and the terebinth;" the "top of the mountains" signifying celestial love, here the love of self; "hills" spiritual love, here, the love of the world; for the love of self is the contrary of celestial love, and the love of the world is the contrary of spiritual love; "the oak, the poplar, and the terebinth," signify the lowest goods of truth and truths of good of the natural man, here the evils of falsity and the falsities of its evil; "because the shadow thereof is good" signifies complacence; the falsifications of spiritual good therefrom are signified by "therefore your daughters commit whoredom," and the adulteration of celestial good by "your daughters-in-law commit adultery."</p><p>[21] In Jeremiah:<p>[According to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number [of the streets] of Jerusalem have ye set up altars, altars to burn incense unto Baal (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_17.htm">17</a>).<p>"Cities" here do not mean cities, nor "gods" gods, nor the "streets of Jerusalem" streets there; but "cities" signify the doctrinals of falsity; "gods" the falsities themselves; and the streets of Jerusalem the falsities of the doctrine of the church. "To set up altars, altars to burn incense unto Baal," signifies worship from the love of self and from the love of the world (as above). This nation did set up altars and burn incense to Baal; but as all things of their worship were representative, the things that were done according to the statutes were representative of things celestial and spiritual; consequently the things that were done contrary to the statutes were representative of things infernal; therefore by "altars set up to the gods," and by "incense offered to Baal," these contrary things are signified.</p><p>[22] In the same:<p>I will speak with them judgments upon all their evil, in that they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods, and have bowed themselves down to the works of their own hands (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_1_16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>).<p>"To burn incense to other gods," and "to bow themselves down to the works of their own hands," signifies worship from the falsities that are from self-intelligence; "other gods" meaning falsities, and the "works of their own hands" what is from self-intelligence.</p><p>[23] The like is signified by:<p>Burning incense to gods (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_11_12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_3.htm">44:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_18.htm">18</a>);<p>Likewise burning incense to graven images (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_11_2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>);<p>And burning incense to vanity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_18_15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a>);<p>The like as above is signified by burning incense to Baal (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_2_13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>);<p>Likewise by burning incense to Melecheth, or the queen of the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_44_25.htm">25</a>).<p>"Melecheth of the heavens" signifies falsities in the whole complex.</p><p>[24] Moreover, "burning incense" signifies those things of worship that are perceived as grateful, and "incense" signifies spiritual good, because all things that were instituted in the Israelitish nation were representative of things celestial and spiritual; for the church with them was not as the church at this day, which is internal, but it was external; and the externals represented and thus signified the internal things of the church, such as were disclosed by the Lord in the Word of the New Testament; for this reason their church was called a representative church. The externals of that church consisted of such things in the world of nature as corresponded to the affections of good and truth in the spiritual world; consequently when those who were of that church were in externals in respect to worship, those who were in the spiritual world, that is, in heaven, were in the internals, and conjoined themselves with those who were in externals; it was in this way that heaven at that time made one with the men on the earth.</p><p>[25] From this it can be seen why there was a table for the bread in the tent of meeting, and why there was a lampstand with lamps, and an altar for incense. For "bread" represented and thence signified the good of love proceeding from the Lord, or celestial good; the "lampstand with lamps" represented and thence signified spiritual good and truth; and "incense" represented and thence signified worship; and because all Divine worship that is perceived as grateful is from spiritual good, therefore that good was signified by "incense." In order that this gratification might be represented the incense was made from fragrant spices, and this also from correspondence; for fragrant odors correspond to the pleasantnesses and delights that are in the thoughts and perceptions from the joy of spiritual love. For this reason incense corresponded to such things as are received as grateful by the Lord and perceived as grateful by angels. This gratification is solely from spiritual good, or from the good of charity towards the neighbor; for this good is celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord in effect; for celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, is brought into effect solely through spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor; consequently to be in this good and to exercise it is to love and worship the Lord. (What charity toward the neighbor is, and what it is to exercise it, see in <a href="../njhd/84.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 84-107</a>.)</p><p>[26] As the "oil" by which anointings were made signified celestial good or the good of love to the Lord, and "incense" signified spiritual good, or the good of charity towards the neighbor, and as the latter is from the former (as was said above), therefore in Exodus (chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_1.htm">30</a>) the preparation of the anointing oil is first treated of, and immediately afterwards the preparation of the incense; the preparation of the anointing oil from verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_23.htm">23</a> to <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_33.htm">33</a>, and the preparation of the incense from verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_34.htm">34</a> to <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_38.htm">38</a>. And as the incense-offering is here treated of I will quote what is there commanded regarding the preparation of incense, namely:<p>Take unto thee fragrant spices, stacte, onycha, and galbanum; fragrant spices and pure frankincense, like quantity with like quantity shall it be. And thou shalt make it an incense, a perfume the work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy; and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the Testimony of the Tent of meeting, where I will meet thee; it shall be unto you the holy of holies. And the incense that thou makest ye shall not make in its quality for yourselves; it shall be unto thee holy to Jehovah. The man who shall make like unto it to smell thereof shall be cut off from his peoples (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>).<p>(But what these particulars signify, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_30_23.htm">Exodus 30:23-33</a>). From this it is clear why frankincense has the same signification as incense when compounded, namely spiritual good.</p><p>[27] As the fragrances pertaining to odor correspond to spiritual pleasantnesses, or to the pleasantnesses arising from spiritual good, so also what is received by the Lord as most grateful is called an:<p>Odor of rest (<a href="../ae/288.htm">288</a>; that the "olive" also signifies that good, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9277.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9277</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10261.htm">10261</a>; that "odor" signifies what is perceived as grateful according to the quality of love and faith, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1514.htm">1514-1519</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3577.htm">3577</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4624.htm">4624-4634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4748.htm">4748</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5621.htm">5621</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10292.htm">10292</a>; that the "odor of rest" signifies the perceptive of peace, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/925.htm">925</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10054.htm">10054</a>; what this is see in the work on <a href="../hh/284.htm">Heaven and Hell 284-290</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 324 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>324. "Et phialas aureas plenas suffitibus." - Quod significet confessionem ex bonis spiritualibus, constat ex significatione "phialarum aurearum", quae etiam "thuribula" et "acerrae" vocantur, quod sint vera ex bono: "phialae" enim, sicut omnia vasa continentia, significant vera; et "aurum", ex quo, significat bonum; inde "phialae aureae" sunt vera ex bono; (quod "vasa" significent vera, quoniam inserviunt bono pro vasis recipientibus et continentibus, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3068" target=_top>3068</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3079" target=_top>3079</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3316" target=_top>3316</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3318" target=_top>3318</a>; et quoque "vasa altarium", "holocausti" et "suffitus", n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9723" target=_top>9723</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9724" target=_top>9724</a>; et quod "aurum" significet bonum, supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_242" target=_top>242</a> (a, d, e);) et ex significatione "suffituum", quod sint illa cultus quae fiunt ex bono spirituali seu ex bono charitatis, et inde grate percipiuntur. Causa quod illa per "suffitus" significentur, est quia omnia quae apud gentem Israeliticam instituta fuerunt, repraesentativa caelestium et spiritualium erant: inde quoque illa quae erant odoris; quae grati odoris erant, repraesentabant perceptionem gratam, at quae ingrati odoris perceptionem ingratam; unde erat, quod suffimentum factum sit ex aromatibus fragrantibus, stacte, onyche, galbano, et thure. Praeterea correspondentia odoris est cum perceptione; quod constare potest ex eo, quod in mundo spirituali, ubi omnia quae appercipiuntur sensibus correspondent, perceptivum boni et veri sentiatur sicut fragrans ex gratis odoribus, et vice versa (de qua re ab experientia videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_1514" target=_top>1514</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_1517" target=_top>1517-1519</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_1631" target=_top>1631</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4626" target=_top>4626</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4628" target=_top>4628</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4630" target=_top>4630</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4631" target=_top>4631</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5711" target=_top>5711-5717</a>). Inde est, quod "odorari" significet percipere, etiam in communi sermone apud homines; talia enim in sermonem humanum venerunt ex correspondentia, ut multa alia; spiritus enim hominis est actualiter in mundo spirituali, tametsi homo id nescit: etiam perceptivum quod est apud hominem producit sensum odoratus in ejus corpore, et hoc quoque ex correspondentia; sed hoc arcanum est quod aegre creditur, quia hactenus ignotum est. Sciendum est quod bonum amoris et charitatis producat illam suaveolentiam seu fragrantiam, sed per verum, non autem ex se absque vero; minus verum quod vocatur fidei absque bono; nam bonum absque vero non habet aliquod perceptivum, nec verum absque bono.<p>[2] Quod "suffitus" significent illa cultus quae fiunt ex bono spirituali, est quia bonum spirituale trahit originem et existentiam ex bono caelesti, et hoc bonum est bonum amoris in Dominum a Domino, et inde est ipsum bonum caeli, est enim id bonum immediate ex Domino, et est Dominus in illo bono ut in suo apud angelos; usque adeo, ut sive dicas Dominum esse in illis et illos in Domino, aut si dicas Dominum esse apud illos in eo bono, et illos in Domino cum in illo bono, idem sit: bonum spirituale, quod trahit originem et existentiam ex bono caelesti, est bonum charitatis erga proximum; cultus ex hoc bono est quisignificatur per "suffitum." Quia omnis cultus Domini fit ex bono, tametsi per vera, et duo bona universalia sunt quae faciunt caelos, et distinguunt illos in duo regna, nempe bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum, et bonum spirituale, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum, ideo duo altaria apud filios Israelis erant, unum pro holocaustis, alterum pro suffitionibus; et per "altare holocausti" significabatur cultus ex bono amoris caelestis, et "per altare suffitus" cultus ex bono amoris spiritualis. Inde patet quid per suffitus repraesentabatur.<p>[3] Quod ita sit, constare potest ex locis in Verbo, ubi memorantur:<p>-Ut apud Mosen,<p>"Facies altare suffitionis suffimenti, .... et obduces illud auro puro, .... et dabis illud ante velum quod super arca testimonii ante propitiatorium; .... et suffiet super illo Aharon suffimentum aromatum quovis mane, in adornando lucernas suffiet illud; et in ascendere faciendo lucernas inter vesperas suffiet illud; suffimentum juge coram Jehovah in generationes vestras: nec ascendere facietis suffimentum alienum et holocaustum et mincham et libamen super eo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_1-10" target=_top>Exodus 30:1-10</a>);<p>quod per hoc "altare" et per "suffitiones" super eo significatus sit cultus qui ex bono spirituali, constare potest ex eo quod hoc positum fuerit in Tentorio conventus extra velum, ubi etiam lucernae, et per "Tentorium" significatum est regnum spirituale Domini, at per illam partem Tentorii quae erat intra velum significatum est regnum caeleste Domini, ut constare potest ex illis quae de Tentorio, ubi mensa super qua panes facierum, ac ubi altare suffitus, ac ubi candelabrum erant, in Arcanis Caelestibus (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9457" target=_top>9457</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9481" target=_top>9481</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9485" target=_top>9485</a>) ostensa sunt; et ex illis quae de arca, in qua testimonium, et super qua propitiatorium (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9457" target=_top>9457</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9481" target=_top>9481</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9485" target=_top>9485</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10545" target=_top>10545</a>): inde patet quod per illa quae in Tentorio extra velum erant, quae fuerunt candelabrum, altare suffitus, et mensa pro panibus, significata sint talia quae regni spiritualis sunt, quae omnia se referunt ad bonum spirituale et ad verum ejus: per "mensam", super qua panes facierum, significata est receptio boni caelestis in bono spirituali (videatur. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9527" target=_top>9527</a>); per "candelabrum" cum lucernis significatum est ipsum spirituale illius regni (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9548" target=_top>9548</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9551" target=_top>9551</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9556" target=_top>9556</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9561" target=_top>9561</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9572" target=_top>9572</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9783" target=_top>9783</a>); et per "altare suffitus" significatus est cultus ex bono spirituali; et quia cultus ex bono spirituali per "suffitionem" super illo altari significatus est, et per "candelabrum" ipsum spirituale, ideo mandatum est ut Aharon quovis mane et vespere, quando adornaret lucernas, etiam super illo suffiret. (sed haec plenius explicata sunt in Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_324/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10176" target=_top>10176-10213</a>, ubi de singulis actum est.)<p>[4] Et quia bonum spirituale suam originem et existentiam trahit ex bono caelesti, ut supra dictum est, ideo altare illud non modo positum erat juxta velum quod super arcam, sed etiam mandatum est, ut cum Aharon expiaret pro se et pro sua domo, inferret suffimentum intra velum, per quod significatur influxus, communicatio et conjunctio boni caelestis et boni spiritualis; de qua re ita apud Mosen:<p>"Cum Aharon .... expiabit pro se et pro sua domo, mactabit juvencum peccati, .... et accipiet plenitudinem thuribuli, prunas ignis desuper altari coram Jehovah, et plenitudinem pugnorum suorum suffimentum aromatum, et inferet intra velum, ita ut det suffimentum super ignem coram Jehovah;

bonum spirituale nisi sit ex bono caelesti, non est bonum; quapropter nec functio ejus fuisset ex Divino, seu aliquid Divini repraesentavisset; ideo denuntiata est illi mors nisi ita fecisset.<p>[5] Inde quoque est quod Nadab et Abihu, filii Aharonis, igne e caelo consumpti fuerint, quia suffiverunt ex alio igne quam ex igne altaris holocausti; ita cultum fecerunt ex alio amore quam ex amore in Dominum; de qua re ita apud Mosen:<p>"Sumpserunt filii Aharonis Nadab et Abihu quisque thuribulum suum, ac dederunt in ea ignem alienum, super quem dederunt suffimentum;
