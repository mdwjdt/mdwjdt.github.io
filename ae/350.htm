<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 350</h4><p>350. CHAPTER 6.<p>1. AND I saw when the Lamb had opened the first of the seals, and I heard one of the four animals saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.<p>2. And I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering and to conquer.<p>3. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second animal saying, Come and see.<p>4. And there went out another horse that was red, and it was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another; and there was given unto him a great sword.<p>5. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third animal saying, Come and see. And I saw, and lo, a black horse; and he that sat thereon had a pair of balances in his hand.<p>6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals, saying, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and hurt not the oil and the wine.<p>7. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth animal saying, Come and see.<p>8. And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat upon him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.<p>9. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar, the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held.<p>10. And they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Lord, who art holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?<p>11. And white robes were given unto every one; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet a little time, until both their fellow-servants and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.<p>12. And I beheld when he opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.<p>13. And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.<p>14. And the heaven departed as a book when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.<p>15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man, hid themselves in the caverns, and in the rocks of the mountains.<p>16. And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb.<p>17. For the great day of his anger is come; and who is able to stand?<p>THE EXPLANATION.<p>VERSES 1, 2. And I saw when the Lamb had opened the first of the seals, and I heard one of the four animals saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering and to conquer.<p>"And I saw," signifies the manifestation of the states of those who belong to the church where the Word is; "when the Lamb had opened the first of the seals," signifies the first manifestation from the Lord; "and I heard one of the four animals saying as with a voice of thunder," signifies out of the inmost heaven from the Lord; "Come and see," signifies attention and perception.<p>"And I saw and behold a white horse," signifies the understanding of truth from the Word; "and he that sat upon him had a bow," signifies the doctrine of charity and faith, by which combat is maintained against evils and falsities, and [by which] they are dissipated; "and a crown was given unto him," signifies life eternal, which is the reward of victory; "and he went forth conquering and to conquer," signifies the removal of evils and thence of falsities at the end of life, and afterwards to eternity. </p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 350 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>350. CAPUT VI.<p>1. Et vidi cum aperuisset Agnus primum ex sigillis, et audivi unum ex quatuor animalibus, dicens tanquam voce tonitrui, Veni et aspice.<p>2. Et vidi, et ecce equus albus; et sedens super illo habens arcum, et data ei corona, et exivit vincens et ut vinceret.<p>3. Et cum aperuisset secundum sigillum, audivi secundum animal dicens, Veni et aspice.<p>4. Et exivit alius equus rufus; et sedenti super illo datum ei tollere pacem de terra, ut alii alios occiderent; et data ei machaera magna.<p>5. Et cum aperuisset tertium sigillum, audivi tertium animal dicens, Veni et aspice: et vidi, et ecce equus niger; et sedens super illo habens stateram in manu sua.<p>6. Et audivi vocem in medio quatuor animalium dicentem, Choenix tritici denario, et tres choenices hordei denario, et oleum et vinum ne laeseris.<p>7. Et cum aperuisset sigillum quartum, audivi vocem quarti animalis dicentem, Veni et aspice.<p>8. Et vidi, et ecce equus pallidus, et sedens super illo, nomen illi mors, et infernus sequebatur cum illo, et data illis potestas interficiendi super quartam partem terrae in romphaea et in fame et in morte et a bestiis terrae.<p>9. Et cum aperuisset quintum sigillum, vidi subter altari animas occisorum propter Verbum Dei, et propter testimonium quod habebant.<p>10. Et clamabant voce magna, dicentes, Usque quo, Domine, qui Sanctus et Verus, non judicas et vindicas sanguinem nostrum de habitantibus super terra?<p>11. Et datae singulis stolae albae; et dictum eis, ut requiescerent adhuc tempus parvum, usque dum complentur et conservi eorum et fratres eorum, qui futuri occidi sicut et illi.<p>12. Et vidi quum aperuisset sigillum sextum, et ecce terrae motus magnus factus est, et sol factus est niger tanquam saccus cilicinus, et luna facta est tanquam sanguis.<p>13. Et stellae caeli ceciderunt in terram, sicut ficus dejicit grossos suos a magno vento concussa.<p>14. Et caelum abscessit tanquam liber convolutus; et omnis mons et insula e locis suis emota sunt.<p>15. Et reges terrae, et magnates et divites, et chiliarchi et potentes, et omnis servus et omnis liber, absconderunt se ipsos in speluncis et in petris montium.<p>16. Et dicebant montibus et petris, Cadite super nos, et abscondite nos a facie Sedentis super throno, et ab ira Agni.<p>17. Quia venit dies magnus irae Ejus, et quis potest consistere?<p>EXPLICATIO.<p>VERSUS <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_350/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_1" target=_top>1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_350/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_2" target=_top>2</a>.<p>"Et vidi eum aperuisset Agnus primum ex sigillis, et audivi unum ex quatuor animalibus dicens tanquam voce tonitrui, Veni et aspice.
