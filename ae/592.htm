<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 592</h4><p>592. CHAPTER 10.<p>1. AND I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven encompassed with a cloud and the rainbow over his head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.<p>2. And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth.<p>3. And he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth. And when he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.<p>4. And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; and I heard a voice out of heaven, saying unto me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.<p>5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven.<p>6. And sware by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, who created heaven, and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there should be time no longer.<p>7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God shall be consummated, as he hath declared in good tidings to his servants the prophets.<p>8. And the voice which I heard out of heaven, spake unto me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.<p>9. And I went unto the angel and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.<p>10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.<p>11. And he said to me, Thou must prophesy again over peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.<p>EXPLANATION.<p>Verse 1. AND I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, encompassed with a cloud and the rainbow upon his head and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. "And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven," signifies the Lord as to the Word, in this case, as to its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter; "encompassed with a cloud," signifies the ultimate of the Word; "and a rainbow over his head," signifies the interior things of the Word; "and his face as the sun," signifies the Divine Love of the Lord, from which is all Divine Truth which is the Word in heaven and in the church; "and his feet as pillars of fire," signifies Divine Truth, or the Word in ultimates, sustaining interior things therein, also full of the good of love. </p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 592 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>592. CAPUT X.<p>1. Et vidi alium angelum fortem descendentem e caelo, circumdatum nube, et iris supra caput, et facies ejus sicut sol, et pedes ejus sicut columnae ignis.<p>2. Et habebat in manu sua libellum apertum, et posuit pedem suum dextrum super mare, et sinistrum super terram.<p>3. Et clamavit voce magna, sicut leo rugit, et cum clamavit locuta sunt septem Tonitrua suas voces.<p>4. Et cum locuta sunt septem tonitrua voces suas, futurus sum scribere; et audivi vocem e caelo dicentem mihi, Obsigna quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua, et ne illa scribas.<p>5. Et angelus, quem vidi stantem super mari et super terra, sustulit manum suam ad caelum.<p>6. Et juravit per Viventem in saecula saeculorum, qui creavit caelum et quae in eo, et terram et quae in ea, et mare et quae in eo, quod tempus non erit amplius.<p>7. Sed in diebus vocis septimi angeli, quando futurus clangere, et consummabitur mysterium Dei, sicut evangelizavit suis servis prophetis.<p>8. Et vox quam audivi e caelo, iterum loquens cum me, et dicens, Abi, accipe libellum apertum in manu angeli stantis super mari et super terra.<p>9. Et abivi ad angelum, dicens ei, Da mihi libellum; et dixit mihi, Accipe et devora illum, et amaricabit tuum ventrem, sed in ore tuo erit dulcis sicut mel.<p>10. Et accepi libellum e manu angeli, et devoravi illum, et erat in ore meo sicut mel dulcis; et cum devoravi illum amaricatus est venter meus.<p>11. Et dixit mihi, Oportet te iterum prophetare super populos et gentes et linguas et reges multos.<p>EXPLICATO.<p>VERSUS 1.<p>"Et vidi alium angelum fortem descendentem e caelo, cirumdatum nube, et iris supra caput, et facies ejus sicut sol, et pedes ejus sicut columnae ignis."<p>1. "Et vidi alium angelum fortem descendentem e caelo", significat Dominum quoad Verbum, hic quoad sensum ejus ultimum, qui vocatur sensus litterae [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_592/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_593" target=_top>593</a>] ; "circumdatum nube", significat ultimum Verbi [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_592/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_594" target=_top>594</a>] ; "et iris supra caput", significat interiora Verbi [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_592/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_595" target=_top>595</a>] ; "et facies ejus sicut sol", significat Divinum Amorem Domini ex quo omne Divinum Verum, quod in caelo et in ecclesia est Verbum [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_592/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_596" target=_top>596</a>] ; "et pedes ejus sicut columnae ignis", significat Divinum Verum seu, Verbum in ultimis sustentans interiora ibi, etiam, plenum bono amoris [n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_592/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_597" target=_top>597</a>] . </p>
