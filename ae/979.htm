<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 979</h4><p>979. Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments. That this signifies that these things take place, because from Divine Good and Divine truth are all essence, life, and power, is evident from the signification of Lord God, as denoting the Lord as to Divine Good and as to Divine truth. For the Lord is called Lord from Divine good, and God from Divine truth; and from the signification of Almighty, as denoting to be, to live, and to be able from Himself (see n. <a href="../ae/43.htm">43</a>, <a href="../ae/689.htm">689</a>, <a href="../ae/939.htm">939</a>); hence also denoting that He is the Esse, the Life, and the power of all; for these things are the Lord from Himself, but are man from the Lord; and from the signification of Thy judgments, as denoting things accomplished, namely, those that are mentioned above in verse 6. That this is meant by judgments, is evident from verse 5, where it is said, Thou art just, O Lord, and holy, because Thou hast judged these things. These judgments are called true from the Divine truth, and are called just from the Divine Good; from these two all things are effected. That just is said of the Divine Good may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/972.htm">972</a>).<p>These words, "Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments," involve the same as the words in verse 5, namely, "Thou art just, O Lord, who is, and who was, and art holy, because thou hast judged these things." The only difference is, that the latter were spoken from the Lord's spiritual kingdom, but the former, from His celestial kingdom. "Even so," is an expression confirmative of the statements from the spiritual kingdom; that they involve the same things, see above (n. <a href="../ae/972.htm">972</a>, <a href="../ae/973.htm">973</a>, <a href="../ae/974.htm">974</a>).<p>Continuation concerning the Fifth Precept:-</p><p>[2] From what has been said above, it is now evident what is meant in the Word by good works, that is, all works that are done by man while evils are being removed as sins. For the works afterwards done are not done by man otherwise than as of himself, for they are done from the Lord. And the works done from the Lord are all good, and are called the goods of life, the goods of charity, and good works. For example: all the judgments of a judge who regards justice as the end, and venerates and loves it as Divine, and who also detests, as infamous, judgments given for the sake of rewards, friendship, or favour. In acting in this way he consults the good of his country by causing justice and judgment to reign therein as in heaven; and thus he consults the peace of all harmless citizens, and guards them from the violence of evil-doers; all these are good works. Also the various offices of administrators, and the dealings of merchants are all good works, when they shun unlawful gains as sins against the Divine laws.<p>When a man shuns evils as sins, he then daily learns what a good work is, and the love of doing good and the love of knowing truths for the sake of good grow with him. For so far as he knows truths, so far he can perform works more fully and more wisely, whence his works become more truly good.<p>Cease therefore to inquire in thyself, "What are the good works that I shall do, or what good shall I do that I may receive life eternal?" Only abstain from evils as sins, and look to the Lord, and the Lord will teach and lead thee. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 979</h4><p>979. Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are Thy judgments, signifies that these things are done because all things have their essence, life and power from the Divine good and the Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of "Lord God," as being the Lord as to the Divine good and the Divine truth; for the Lord is called "Lord" from the Divine good, and "God" from the Divine truth. Also from the signification of "Almighty," as being to be, to live, and to have power from Himself (See n. <a href="../ae/43.htm">43</a>, <a href="../ae/689.htm">689</a>, <a href="../ae/939.htm">939</a>); so also that He is being, life, and power to all things; for the Lord is all this from Himself, but man is all this from the Lord. Also from the signification of "Thy judgments," as being those things that are being done, namely, those mentioned above in the sixth verse. That this is what is meant by "judgments" is evident from the fifth verse, where it is said, "Just art Thou, O Lord, and holy, because Thou hast judged these things." These judgments are called "true" from the Divine truth, and "just" from the Divine good, from which two all things are effected. (That "just" is predicated of the Divine good may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/972.htm">972</a>.) The same things are involved in these words, "Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are Thy judgments," as in the words of the fifth verse, "Thou art just, O Lord, who art and who wast, and art holy, because Thou hast judged these things." The only difference is that the latter were said from the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the former from His celestial kingdom. "Yea" is here an expression confirmative of the statements from the spiritual kingdom. That the same things are involved see above (n. <a href="../ae/972.htm">972-974</a>), and compare.<p>(Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment)</p><p>[2] From what has been said above, what is meant in the Word by good works can now be seen, namely, that they are all works done by man when evils have been removed as sins. For the works done after this are done from man only as if from him; for they are done from the Lord, and all works done from the Lord are good, and are called the goods of life, the goods of charity, and good works; as for instance, all the judgments of a judge who has justice as his end, and who venerates and loves it as Divine, and who detests as infamous decisions made for the sake of rewards or friendship, or from favor. Thus he consults the good of his country by causing justice and judgment to reign therein as in heaven; and thus he consults the peace of every innocent citizen and protects him from the violence of evildoers. All these are good works. So all services of managers and dealings of merchants are good works when they shun unlawful gains as sins against the Divine laws. When a man shuns evils as sins he daily learns what a good work is, and the affection of doing good grows with him, and the affection of knowing truths for the sake of good; for so far as he knows truths he can perform works more fully and more wisely, and thus his works become more truly good. Cease, therefore, from asking in thyself, "What are the good works that I must do, or what good must I do to receive eternal life?" Only cease from evils as sins and look to the Lord, and the Lord will teach and lead you. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 979 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>979. "Etiam Domine Deus omnipotens, vera et justa judicia tua." - Quod significet quod haec fiant, quia ex Divino Bono ac Divino Vero est omnis essentia, vita et potentia, constat ex significatione "Domini Dei", quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum et quoad Divinum Verum; Dominus enim vocatur "Dominus" ex Divino Bono, ac "Deus" ex Divino Vero; ex significatione "omnipotentis", quod sit esse, vivere et posse ex Se Ipso (de qua [supra] , n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_979/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_43" target=_top>43</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_979/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_689" target=_top>689</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_979/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_939" target=_top>939</a>); inde etiam quod sit omnium esse, vivere et posse; nam Dominus ex Se Ipso illa sunt, homo autem a Domino: ex significatione "judiciorum tuorum", quod sint quae fiunt, nempe illa quae supra (versu 6) dicta sunt; quod hoc intelligatur per quae "judicia", patet a versu quinto, ubi dicitur, "Justus Domine es et sanctus, quia haec judicasti": judicia illa dicuntur "vera" ex Divino Vero, et dicuntur "justa" ex Divino Bono, ex quibus duobus omnia fiunt. <p>(Quod "justum" dicatur de Divino Bono, videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_979/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_972" target=_top>972</a>.) Haec verba, nempe, "Etiam Domine Deus omnipotens, vera et justa judicia tua", involvunt eadem quae verba in versu quinto, nempe, "Justus, Domine, es, qui est et qui erat, et sanctus, quia haec judicasti"; differentia solum est, quod haec dicta sint e regno spirituali Domini, illa autem e regno caelesti Ipsius, "etiam" hic est vox confirmativa dictorum e regno spirituali. Quod eadem involvant, vide supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_979/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_972" target=_top>972-974</a>), et confer.<p>[2] (Continuatio de Quinto Praecepto.)<p>Ex supra dictis nunc constare potest quid per "bona opera" in Verbo intelligitur; nempe, omnia opera quae ab homine fiunt, dum remota sunt mala ut peccata: nam opera quae deinde fiunt, non ab homine aliter quam sicut ab illo fiunt; fiunt enim a Domino; et quae a Domino, omnia bona sunt, et vocantur bona vitae, bona charitatis, et bona opera: sicut omnia judicia judicis, qui pro fine justitiam habet, et hanc ut Divinam veneratur et amat, ac judicationes propter munera, pro amicitia, et ex favore, ut flagitia detestatur; sic enim consulit bono patriae, efficiendo ut judicium et justitia ibi sicut in caelo regnent; et sic consulit paci cujusvis civis insontis, et custodit a violentia maleficorum; quae omnia sunt bona opera: sunt etiam administratorum officia, et mercatorum negotia omnia bona opera, quando quaestus illicitos ut peccata contra leges Divinas fugiunt. Dum homo fugit mala ut peccata, tunc discit indies quid bonum opus, et apud illum crescit affectio faciendi bonum, et affectio sciendi vera propter bonum; nam quantum scit vera, tantum potest opera plenius et sapientius facere; inde opera fiunt verius bona. Desistas itaque in te quaerere, "Quae sunt bona opera quae faciam, aut quid boni faciam ut vitam aeternam accipiam?" Abstine modo a malis ut peccatis, et specta ad Dominum, ac Dominus docebit et ducet. </p>
