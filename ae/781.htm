<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 781</h4><p>781. And his feet were as those of a bear. This signifies reasonings from natural things which are fallacies, is evident from the signification of feet, as denoting things natural (concerning which see above; (n. <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>, <a href="../ae/600.htm">600</a>, <a href="../ae/632.htm">632</a>, <a href="../ae/666.htm">666</a>). Also from the signification of a bear, as denoting those who are in power from the natural sense of the Word, both the good and the evil, concerning which we shall speak presently. The reason why by the feet of the beast which, as to the body, was like a leopard, and as to the feet like a bear, are signified fallacies is, because by the leopard are signified reasonings which are discordant, and yet appear to be coherent (concerning which see just above, n. <a href="../ae/780.htm">780</a>). And those reasonings, so far as they are from the ultimate Natural, which is the Sensual, are fallacies, these being signified by the feet of the bear.</p><p>[2] Beasts, both clean and unclean, are frequently mentioned in the Word, and signify various things pertaining either to heaven or hell, the clean and useful beasts signifying such things as pertain to heaven, and the unclean and useless, such as pertain to hell. But what those signify that pertain to heaven and hell cannot be better known than from representatives in the spiritual world, where also beasts appear; all of which are appearances representing the thoughts of angels and spirits arising from their affections, inclinations, appetites, pleasures, and desires. For in the spiritual world these things are set forth before the eyes in various forms, in the form of gardens, forests, fields, plains, and also fountains; also palaces and houses, and chambers therein, in which are various decorations and articles. Tables upon which are various kinds of food there are seen also. Moreover, these things are shown in the forms of animals of the earth, fowls of the heaven, and reptiles, in an infinite variety; and not only forms like those on our earth, but in various composite forms, such as exist nowhere on earth, several of which it has been granted me to see. And when such things appear, it is known immediately from what spiritual origin they are, and thus what they signify. But those animals and fowls immediately disappear, as soon as the spirit or angel ceases from his thought and meditation.</p><p>[3] That such things do appear in the spiritual world, is evident from similar things seen by the prophets; as, for example, the Lord appeared like a lamb; cherubs were seen with faces like a lion, an ox, and an eagle, in Ezekiel; horses were seen going forth out of the book of life, when the Lamb opened its seals; also a white horse, and several white horses, upon which they rode in heaven, in the Apocalypse; and also white, bay, red, black, and grisled horses, in Zechariah; also a red dragon which had several heads and horns was seen; and now here was seen a beast like a leopard, with the feet of a bear, the mouth of a lion, as also another beast which had two horns like a lamb; and afterwards a scarlet beast upon which sat a woman. There also appeared to Daniel four beasts coming up out of the sea, the first of which was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle, the other like a bear, the third like a leopard, which had four wings, and the fourth terrible. It is evident, therefore, not only that such beasts appear in the spiritual world, but also that they are significative. It can therefore be seen that all the beasts, and also all the birds, mentioned in the Word, are significative of such things as are represented by beasts in the spiritual world. The signification of the bear will be shown in what follows.</p><p>[4] But before demonstrating from the Word, we will illustrate by some examples what is meant by the fallacies that are here signified by the feet as those of a bear. Several things are called fallacies which man reasons and forms conclusions about from the natural man without spiritual light, that is, without the light of the understanding enlightened by the Lord. For the natural man takes the ideas of his thought from earthly, corporeal, and worldly objects, which in themselves are material; and when the thought of a man is not raised above these, he thinks materially about things spiritual. And material thought without spiritual light derives all its quality from the loves of the natural man and from their delights, these being contrary to heavenly loves and to their delights. For this reason, conclusions and reasonings from the natural man alone, and his foolish light (lumen), are fallacies. But this shall be illustrated by examples. It is a fallacy that faith which is merely a matter of the thought saves, when, notwithstanding, a man is such as the quality of his life.</p><p>[5] It is a fallacy that faith which is merely a matter of the thought is spiritual, when, notwithstanding, to love the Lord above all things, and the neighbour as oneself, is what is really spiritual; and to love is to will and do. It is a fallacy that faith is also given instantaneously, when, notwithstanding, a man must be purified from evils and from the falsities therefrom, and be regenerated by the Lord, which is a process of long continuance; and in proportion only as he is purified and regenerated does he receive spiritual faith. It is a fallacy that man can receive faith and be saved at the hour of death, whatever his life has been, when, notwithstanding, the life of a man remains, and he is judged according to his deeds and works. It is a fallacy that faith is communicated to children by baptism, when, notwithstanding, faith must be procured by the knowledges of truth and good, and by a life according to them. It is a fallacy that by faith alone the church exists in man, when, notwithstanding, it is by the faith of charity that the church exists in him; and charity pertains to the life, and not to faith separate from the life.</p><p>[6] It is a fallacy that man is justified by faith alone, and that, when he is justified, the Lord's merit is thereby imputed to him, and that afterwards nothing can condemn him, when, notwithstanding, faith without the life of faith, which is charity, is sometimes said to be living without a soul, but which, in itself, is dead; for charity is the soul of faith, because it is the life thereof. Therefore a man is not justified by a dead faith, much less is the Lord's merit thereby imputed and salvation effected; and where there is no salvation, there is condemnation. It is a fallacy that love and charity are implanted in faith alone, when, notwithstanding, love and charity are to will and do; for what a man loves, this he not only thinks, but also wills and does. It is a fallacy that where doing is spoken of in the Word, and where deeds and works are mentioned, is meant thereby to have faith, because these are implanted in faith, when, notwithstanding, they are distinct like thought and will; for a man can think many things which he does not will, whereas what he wills this he thinks when left to himself; and to will is to do. The will also and thought therefrom is the real man, and not the thought separate from the will; and deeds and works belong to the will and thence to the thought but faith alone belongs to the thought, separate from deeds and works, which belong to the will.</p><p>[7] It is a fallacy that faith must be separated from good works because a man cannot do good of himself, and if he does good that he places merit therein, when, notwithstanding, man does not do good from himself, but from the Lord, when he does it from the Word, because the Lord is in the Word, and also is the Word; and a man does not do good of himself when he does it as of himself, and yet believes that it is from the Lord because from the Word. Also because he believes that the good which he does is from the Lord, he cannot place merit in acts.</p><p>[8] It is a fallacy that the understanding must be held captive under obedience to faith, and that faith seen in the understanding is not spiritual faith, when, nevertheless, it is the understanding which is enlightened in the things of faith when the Word is read; and the understanding shut out from enlightenment does not know whether a thing be true or false; consequently faith in such a case does not become a man's own, but the faith of another in him; and this is a mere historical faith, which can see falsities as truths and truths as falsities. Hence comes the faith characterising heresies of all kinds.</p><p>[9] It is a fallacy that the confidence which is called saving faith, conceived without understanding, is spiritual confidence, when, nevertheless, confidence without understanding is the result of persuasion by another, or of confirmation by passages scattered here and there in the Word, which are collected together, and by reasonings from the natural man applied to a false principle. Such confidence is a blind faith, which, because it does not consider whether what it conceives be true or false, is merely natural. Moreover, all truth desires to be seen, because it is of the light of heaven; but the truth which is not seen may be falsified by various means; and truth falsified is falsity.</p><p>[10] Such are the fallacies connected merely with faith separate from good works. There are still various others, which have reference not only to faith, but also to good works, to charity, and to the neighbour; and especially to their conjunctions with faith, which are artfully devised by the learned.<p>The reason why such fallacies are signified by the feet of a bear is, that by a bear are signified those who are in power from the natural sense of the Word, as well the upright as the wicked. And because by feet are signified natural things, therefore by the feet of the bear are signified the fallacies from which, by reasonings, they falsify the sense of the letter of the Word, and into which they turn the appearance of truth pertaining to that sense.</p><p>[11] That a bear signifies power from the natural sense of the Word, both with the upright and the wicked, is evident from the following passages. In 2 Kings:<p>"When Elisha went up to Bethel, as he was going in the way, there came boys out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up thou bald head, go up thou bald head; and he looked back behind him, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah; and there came two bears out of the forest, and tore in pieces forty-two children of them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_24.htm">24</a>).<p>Why the boys were cursed by Elisha and therefore torn in pieces by two bears, because they called him bald head, cannot be known, unless it be known what Elisha represented, and what a bald head signifies, and also what is signified by the bears. That this was not done by Elisha from immoderate anger and an unjust reason, is evident from this, that he could not be so cruel because the little boys merely said, "Go up thou bald head." It was indeed an insult to the prophet, but not a sufficient reason for them to be torn in pieces by bears. But this occurred because Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word, thus the Word, which is from the Lord. By bald head was signified the Word deprived of the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter; and by the bears out of the wood is signified the power from the natural or literal sense of the Word, as was said above; and by the boys were signified those who blaspheme the Word because its natural sense is such as it is. By forty-two is signified blasphemy. It is now evident, therefore, that by those things was represented, and thence signified, punishment for blaspheming the Word.<p>For all the power and sanctity of the Word is contained in the sense of the letter; for if this sense did not exist, there would be no Word; since without it the Word would be like a house without a foundation, which would tremble, fall to pieces, and be destroyed. It would be also like a man without a skin, which covers and keeps the enclosed viscera in their place and order. And because baldness has this signification, and Elisha represented the Word, therefore the children were torn in pieces by bears, by which was signified the power from the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, both with the upright and the wicked. From these things also it is evident, that the historical parts of the Word, equally with its prophetical parts, contain a spiritual sense.</p><p>[12] The signification of the bear which David smote is similar, concerning which it is written as follows in 1 Samuel:<p>"David said unto Saul, Thy servant was feeding his father's flock, and there came a lion and a bear, and took away a sheep of the flock; I went out after him, and smote him, and when he arose against me, I took hold of his beard and smote him, and slew him; thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; therefore this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, because he hath opprobriously defied the forces of the living God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_34.htm">17:34-37</a>).<p>The reason why power was given to David to smite the lion and the bear which took away the sheep from the flock, was, that David represented the Lord as to Divine truth, by which those who belong to His church are instructed; and by the lion is signified the power of spiritual Divine truth, and in the opposite sense, as in this case, the power of infernal falsity against Divine truth; and by the bear is signified the power of natural Divine truth, and in the opposite sense, the power of falsity against that truth; but by the sheep from the flock are signified those who belong to the Lord's church. And because these things are represented, therefore power was given to David to smite the bear and the lion, in order that by this might be represented and signified the Lord's power of defending His own in the church by means of His Divine truth, from the falsities of evil which are from hell. That David took hold of the beard of the bear, involves a mystery, which may indeed be opened up, but can scarcely be comprehended. The beard signifies Divine truth in the ultimates, in which its very power consists. This truth even the evil, who are in falsities, do indeed confess with their mouth, but they misuse it in order to destroy it; when, however, it is taken away they have no longer any power; hence he slew the bear, and smote the lion. But this will be further explained elsewhere.<p>By Goliath, who was a Philistine, and thence uncircumcised, are signified those who are in truths without good; and truths without good are truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities. "Uncircumcised" signifies those who are in unclean corporeal loves; for the foreskin corresponds to those loves. It is evident, therefore, what the victory of David over Goliath represented.</p><p>[13] From these considerations it is evident why David is compared by Hushai to a bear bereaved in the field (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_17_8.htm">2 Sam. 17:8</a>).<p>In Daniel:<p>"Another beast ascending out of the sea, like to a bear, and it raised up itself upon its side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">7:5</a>).<p>By the four beasts ascending out of the sea, is described the successive states of the church, even to the devastation which is its end; and by this other beast, which was like a bear, is signified the falsification of the truth of the Word, the power thereof still remaining in the sense of the letter. The desire to falsify its goods is signified by its raising itself up on one side. By the three ribs in the mouth between the teeth, are signified the knowledges of truth from the Word in abundance, which are perverted by reasonings from fallacies; and by eating much flesh, is signified the destruction of good by falsities; also the appropriation of evil.</p><p>[14] In Hosea:<p>"I am become to them as a lion, as a leopard will I watch by the way; I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved, and there will I devour as a fierce lion; the wild beast of the field shall rend them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_7.htm">13:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_13_8.htm">8</a>).<p>The signification of "I am become to them as a lion, as a leopard will I watch by the way," was explained in the preceding article. By meeting them as a bear that is bereaved, is signified the falsification of the sense of the letter of the Word. By devouring as a fierce lion, is signified the destruction and devastation of every truth of the Word, and consequently of the church. The wild beast of the field shall rend them, signifies that they will perish by falsities from evil.</p><p>[15] In Lamentations:<p>"Although I cry and shout, he obstructeth my prayers, he hath fenced the ways with hewn stone, he hath overturned my paths; a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places, he hath turned aside my ways, he hath made me desolate" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_3_8.htm">3:8-11</a>).<p>This is a lamentation from God concerning the desolation of truth in the church. And that they cannot be heard because of falsities is signified by, although I cry and shout, he obstructeth my prayers. That falsities from man's own intelligence turn aside and reject the influx of truth is signified by, he hath fenced about the ways with hewn stone, he hath overturned my paths. By the ways and paths of God are signified truths leading to good, and by hewn stone are signified those things that are from man's own intelligence. Because these things are signified by hewn stone it was forbidden to construct an altar of hewn stones, and similarly with regard to the temple of Jerusalem. A bear lying in wait for me, signifies the natural man perverting the sense of the letter of the Word. A lion in secret places, signifies that the interior natural man, from the evils in him, perverts the entire meaning of the truth of the Word, and consequently of the church; whence come falsities. He hath turned aside my ways, he has made me desolate, signifies the devastation of the truth of the church.</p><p>[16] Again, in Amos:<p>"Woe to them that desire the day of Jehovah! What is the day of Jehovah to you? A day of darkness and not of light; as he who fleeth from a lion meeteth a bear, or who cometh to a house and leaneth his hand upon the wall, and a serpent biteth him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_18.htm">5:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_19.htm">19</a>).<p>By the day of Jehovah is meant the Coming of the Lord, who is the Messiah whom they expected. And because they believed that He would deliver them from earthly enemies, and exalt them in glory above all nations, therefore they desired Him. But as the Lord did not come for the sake of any kingdom on earth, but for the sake of a kingdom in heaven; and because the Jewish nation was in the falsities of evil, which were then made manifest, therefore it is said, "Woe to them that desire the day of Jehovah; What is the day of Jehovah to you? A day of darkness, not of light." Darkness and not light denotes the falsities in which they were. As he who fleeth from a lion meeteth a bear, signifies fear on account of the dominion of falsity, in seeking truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, which they cannot but falsify. For he is said to flee from a lion and to meet with a bear, who is interiorly in falsity from evil, and is led to the knowledge of truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, which, because of the interior dominion of falsity from evil, he, in that case, cannot but pervert. He who cometh to a house, and leaneth his hand upon a wall, and a serpent biteth him, signifies that while, being of such a nature, he consults the Word in the sense of the letter, seeking what is good, he does not see that evils pervert it; the bite of the serpent here signifying the falsification which arises from the interior dominion of falsity from evil.</p><p>[17] Again, in Isaiah:<p>"The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard with the kid; the calf shall lie down, and the young lion and fatling together, and a little boy shall lead them; and the heifer and the bear shall feed, and their young shall lie down together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_6.htm">11:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_7.htm">7</a>).<p>What is signified by the wolf dwelling with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling lying down together, and a little boy leading them, was explained in the preceding article. By the heifer and the bear feeding, and their young lying down together, is signified that the power and desire of the natural man to falsify the truths of the Word, shall not hurt the good of the natural man and the affection thereof; the heifer denoting the affection of good and truth pertaining to the natural man; and the bear, the power and desire of the natural man to falsify the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. The lion shall eat straw like an ox, signifies that infernal falsity, which burns to destroy the truths of the church, shall not hurt the affection of good pertaining to the natural man, either in the case of man in himself or of men among each other; and that neither shall it hurt the Word. Straw signifies the Word in the letter, which is perverted by infernal falsity, but cannot be perverted by those who are in truths from good.</p><p>[18] Again in the same prophet:<p>"We feel for the wall as the blind, we grope as they that have no eyes; we stumble at noon-day as in the twilight; among the living as dead. We roar as bears, and moaning we moan as doves; we look for judgment but there is none, salvation is far from us; for our prevarications are multiplied before thee, and our sins answer against us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_10.htm">59:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_12.htm">12</a>).<p>We feel for the wall as the blind, and we grope as they that have no eyes, signifies that there is not any understanding of truth. We stumble at noon-day as in the twilight, signifies a falling into errors, although they are in the church where is the Word, by means of which they might come into the light of truth. Among the living as dead, signifies that they might be in spiritual life by the Word, and yet are not, because they are in falsities. We roar as bears, and moaning we moan as doves, signifies the grief of the natural man, and thence of the spiritual man. We look for judgment but there is none, salvation is far from us, signifies the hope of the enlightenment of the understanding, and thence of salvation, but in vain. Our prevarications before thee, are multiplied, and our sins answer against us, signifies, by reason of falsities from evil.</p><p>[19] From these considerations it is now evident, that by a bear is signified the natural man as to power from the sense of the letter of the Word, in both senses; also as to the desire of falsifying that sense. That such things are signified by a bear, has been made evident to me from bears seen in the spiritual world, in whose forms were represented the thoughts of those who were natural, and who studied the Word, while by knowledge therefrom they desired to prevail. There were also seen bears which had ribs between their teeth, like that described in Daniel; and it was permitted to be understood that by the ribs were represented the knowledges which, while in the world, they drew from the Word. White bears were seen also, which represented the power of the spiritual-natural man through the Word. Moreover, in that world there are seen animals compounded from bears, panthers, wolves, oxen, and also the same furnished with wings, which all are significative of such persons, whilst they pass along in meditation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 781</h4><p>781. And his feet were as of a bear, signifies from natural things which are fallacies. This is evident from the signification of "feet," as being natural things (See above, n. <a href="../ae/69.htm">69</a>, <a href="../ae/600.htm">600</a>, <a href="../ae/632.htm">632</a>, <a href="../ae/666.htm">666</a>); also from the signification of a "bear," as being those who are in power from the natural sense of the Word, both the good and the evil (of which presently). The "feet" of the beast whose body was like a leopard's and whose feet were like a bear's signifies fallacies, because a "leopard" signifies reasonings which are discordant and yet appear to be coherent (See just above, n. <a href="../ae/780.htm">780</a>, and so far as such reasonings are from the lowest natural, which is the sensual, they are fallacies, which are signified by "the feet of a bear."</p><p>[2] Beasts, both clean and unclean, are mentioned in many passages in the Word, and they signify various things pertaining either to heaven or to hell; clean and useful beasts signify such things as pertain to heaven, unclean and useless beasts such things as pertain to hell. But what pertaining to heaven or to hell is signified can be best known from representatives in the spiritual world, where also beasts appear, all of which are appearances representing such things as angels or spirits are thinking from their affections, inclinations, appetites, pleasures, and desires. These things are presented before their eyes in various forms, as gardens, forests, fields, plains, and also fountains; likewise palaces and houses, and chambers therein, in which are decorative and useful things; also tables are seen upon which are various kinds of food. They are also exhibited in the forms of animals of the earth, the flying things of heaven, and creeping things, in an infinite variety; not only in the forms of such animals and flying things as are upon our earth, but in forms composite from several forms, which nowhere exist on earth, many of which it has been granted me to see. When these appear, their spiritual origin and thus what they signify is at once known. But as soon as the spirit or angel ceases from his thought and meditation these animals and birds instantly vanish.</p><p>[3] That such things are seen in the spiritual world is clearly evident from like things seen by the prophets as that the Lord appeared like a Lamb; cherubs were seen with faces like a lion, an ox, and an eagle (described in Ezekiel); horses were seen going forth out of the book of life when the Lamb opened its seals, also a white horse, and also many white horses upon which those in heaven rode (in John); also white, bay, red, black, and grisled horses (in Zechariah); there was also seen a red dragon having many heads and horns; and now here was seen a beast like a leopard, with the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion; also another beast having two horns like a lamb, and afterwards a scarlet beast upon which sat a woman. Again, to Daniel four beasts coming up out of the sea appeared, the first of which appeared like a lion with wings of an eagle, the second like a bear, the third like a leopard which had four wings, and the fourth terrible. From this it is clear not only that such beasts appear in the spiritual world, but also that they are significative; and from this it can also be seen that all the beasts as well as all the birds mentioned in the Word are significative of such things as are represented by beasts in the spiritual world. But what is signified by "the bear" will be told in what follows.</p><p>[4] Before this is shown from the Word I will illustrate by some examples what is meant by the fallacies that are here signified by "the feet as of a bear." The many things that man reasons and forms conclusions about from the natural man without spiritual light, that is, without the light of the understanding enlightened by the Lord, are called fallacies, for the natural man takes the ideas of his thought from earthly, corporeal, and worldly things, which in themselves are material; and when a man's thought is not elevated above these he thinks materially about things spiritual; and material thought without spiritual light derives everything from the loves of the natural man and from their delights, which are contrary to heavenly loves and their delights. This is why conclusions and reasonings from the natural man alone and its delusive lumen are fallacies. But let this be illustrated by examples.</p><p>[5] It is a fallacy that cogitative faith saves, since man is such as his life is. It is a fallacy that cogitative faith is spiritual, since to love the Lord above all things and the neighbor as oneself is the spiritual itself, and to love is to will and do. It is a fallacy that faith can also be given in a moment, since man must be purified from evils and from falsities therefrom and be regenerated by the Lord, and this is a long-continued process, and only so far as man is purified and regenerated does he receive spiritual faith. It is a fallacy that man can receive faith and be saved at the hour of death whatever his life may have been, since a man's life remains and he is judged according to his deeds and works.</p><p>[6] It is a fallacy that little children also have faith through baptism, since faith must be acquired through the knowledges of truth and good, and by a life in accordance with them. It is a fallacy that through faith alone the church exists with man, since it is through the faith of charity that the church exists with him; and charity is of the life, and not of faith separated from the life. It is a fallacy that man is justified by faith alone, and that the merit of the Lord is thereby imputed to him when he is justified, and that afterwards nothing condemns him, since faith without the life of faith, which is charity, is like something that is said to be living but has no soul, which in itself is dead; for charity is the soul of faith, because it is its life; consequently man is not justified by a dead faith, much less is the merit of the Lord imputed and salvation effected by it; and where there is no salvation there is condemnation.</p><p>[7] It is a fallacy that in faith alone, there is love and charity, since love and charity are willing and doing, for what a man loves he not only thinks but also wills and does. It is a fallacy that where "doing" and "deeds" and "works" are mentioned in the Word to have faith is meant, because these are present in faith, since these are as distinct as thought and will are; for a man can think many things that he does not will, while what he wills he thinks when left alone to himself; and to will is to do. Moreover, the will and the thought therefrom are the man himself, and not the thought separate; and deeds and works are of the will and of the thought therefrom; while faith alone is of the thought separate from deeds and works, which are of the will.</p><p>[8] It is a fallacy that faith is to be separated from good works because man is unable to do good of himself, and if he does good he places merit in it, since man when he does good from the Word does not do it from himself but from the Lord, because the Lord is in the Word and is the Word; and man then does not do good of himself, when he does it as of himself and yet believes that he does it from the Lord, because from the Word; moreover, when a man believes that the good that he does is from the Lord he cannot place merit in the deeds. It is a fallacy that the understanding must be held bound under obedience to faith, and that faith seen by the understanding is not spiritual faith; when yet it is the understanding that is enlightened in the things of faith when the Word is read; and when enlightenment is excluded the understanding does not know whether a thing is true or false; and in that case faith does not become a man's own faith but the faith of another in him, and this is a historical faith, and when it is confirmed it becomes a persuasive faith, which can see falsities as truths and truths as falsities. This is the source of all heretical beliefs.</p><p>[9] It is a fallacy that the confidence that is called saving faith, accepted without understanding, is spiritual confidence, since confidence apart from understanding is a persuasion from another, or from confirmation by passages gathered up here and there from the Word, and applied by reasonings from the natural man to a false principle. Such confidence is a blind faith, which is merely natural because it does not see whether a thing is true or false. Moreover, all truth wishes to be seen because it belongs to the light of heaven; but truth that is not seen may be falsified in many ways; and falsified truth is falsity.</p><p>[10] Such are the fallacies that pertain merely to such faith as is separated from good works. There are yet many others that pertain not only to faith but also to good works, to charity, and to the neighbor, and especially to such conjunctions of these with faith as are skillfully adjusted by the learned. Such fallacies are signified by "the feet of a bear," because a "bear" signifies those, both the well-disposed and the evil, who have power from the natural sense of the Word. And as "feet" signify things natural, "the feet of the bear" signify the fallacies from which the sense of the letter of the Word is falsified by reasonings, and into which the appearances of truth of that sense are changed.</p><p>[11] That a "bear" signifies power from the natural sense of the Word, both with the well-disposed and with the evil, can be seen from the following passages. In the second book of Kings:<p>When Elisha went up to Bethel, as he was going up in the way there came forth boys out of the city and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up thou baldhead, go up thou baldhead. And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah; and there came forth two she-bears out of the forest, and tare in pieces forty-two boys (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_24.htm">24</a>).<p>Why the boys were cursed by Elisha and in consequence were torn by two bears because they called him "baldhead," cannot be known except by knowing what "Elisha" represented, and what a "baldhead" signifies, and what "bears" signify. This evidently was not done by Elisha from unrestrained anger and without just cause, for he could not have been so cruel merely because the little boys said, "Go up thou baldhead." This was indeed, an insult to the prophet, but not a sufficient reason for their being therefore torn to pieces by bears. But this was done because Elisha represented the Lord in respect to the Word, thus the Word that is from the Lord. "Baldhead" signified the Word deprived of the natural sense, which is the sense of its letter; and "bears out of the forest" signified power from the natural sense or sense of the letter of the Word, as has been said above; and these "boys" signified such as blaspheme the Word because its natural sense is such as it is; and "forty-two" signifies blasphemy. From this it is clear that this represented and thence signified the punishment for blaspheming the Word. For all the power and sanctity of the Word are gathered up and have their seat in the sense of its letter; for without this sense the Word could not exist, since without it the Word would be like a house without a foundation, which would be shaken by the wind, and thus be overthrown and fall to pieces. The Word would also be like a man without a skin, which surrounds and holds the enclosed viscera in their position and order. And as this is the signification of "baldness," and "Elisha" represented the Word, the boys were torn in pieces by bears which signifies the power from the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, both with the well-disposed and with the evil. From this it is clear that the historical things of the Word, as well as its prophecies, contain a spiritual sense.</p><p>[12] The bear that David smote has a like signification; this is described in the first book of Samuel:<p>David said unto Saul, Thy servant was pasturing his father's flock, and there came a lion and a bear and took away a sheep from the flock; I went out after him and smote him; and when he arose against me I took hold of his beard and smote him and killed him. Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear. Therefore this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, because he hath reproached the ranks of the living God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>).<p>Power was given to David to smite the lion and the bear that took away the sheep from the flock, because "David" represented the Lord in reference to Divine truth in which those who are of His church are instructed; and a "lion" signifies the power of spiritual Divine truth, and in the contrary sense, as here, the power of infernal falsity against Divine truth; while a "bear" signifies the power of natural Divine truth, and in the contrary sense the power of falsity against that truth. But "a sheep from the flock" signifies those who are of the Lord's church. And as this was represented, the power was given to David to smite the bear and the lion, to represent and signify the Lord's power to defend by His Divine truth His own in the church from the falsities of evil that are from hell. David's taking hold of the beard of the bear involves an arcanum that may be disclosed, indeed, but can scarcely be comprehended. The "beard" signifies the Divine truth in ultimates, in which its essential power rests. This truth also the evil who are in falsities carry indeed in the mouth but they misuse it to destroy; but when it is taken away they no longer have any power. This is why he killed the bear and smote the lion. But this will be further explained elsewhere. But "Goliath," who was a Philistine and was therefore called "uncircumcised," signifies such as are in truths without good; and truths without good are truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities. "The uncircumcised" signifies those who are in filthy corporeal loves; for the foreskin corresponds to those loves. From this it is clear what the victory of David over Goliath represented. From this it can be seen why:<p>David is compared by Hushai to a bear bereaved in the field (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_17_8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>).</p><p>[13] In Daniel:<p>Another beast coming up out of the sea was like to a bear, and it raised itself upon its side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>).<p>The four beasts coming up out of the sea depict the successive states of the church, even to its devastation, which is its end. This second beast, which was "like to a bear," signifies the falsification of the truth of the Word, the power of which still remains in the sense of the letter. The eagerness to falsify its goods is signified by "raising itself upon one side." The "three ribs in the mouth between the teeth" signify the knowledges of truth from the Word in abundance, which are perverted by reasonings from fallacies; and "to devour much flesh" signifies the destruction of good by falsities, and the appropriation of evil.</p><p>[14] In Hosea:<p>I am become to them as a lion, as a leopard will I watch over the way; I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved; and there I will devour as a huge lion; the wild beast of the field shall rend them (Hosea 3:7, 8).<p>The signification of the words, "I am become to them as a lion, as a leopard will I watch over the way," was explained in the preceding article. "To meet them as a bear that is bereaved" signifies the falsification of the sense of the letter of the Word; "to devour as a huge lion" signifies the destruction and devastation of every truth of the Word, and thence of the church; "the wild beast of the field shall rend them" signifies that they will be destroyed by the falsities from evil.</p><p>[15] In Lamentations:<p>Although I cry out and shout he shutteth out my prayers, he hath hedged about my ways with hewn stone, he hath overturned my footpaths; a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places, he hath perverted my ways, he hath made me desolate (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_3_8.htm">Lamentations 3:8-11</a>).<p>This is a lamentation from God respecting the desolation of truth in the church; and that they cannot be heard by reason of falsities is signified by "Although I cry out and shout he shutteth out my prayers." That falsities from self-intelligence turn away and reject the influx of truth is signified by "he hath hedged about my ways with hewn stone, he hath overturned my footpaths;" God's "ways and footpaths" signifying truths leading to good, and "hewn stone" what belongs to self-intelligence. Because this was the signification of "hewn stone" it was forbidden to build an altar of hewn stones, and likewise the temple at Jerusalem. "A bear lying in wait for me" signifies the natural man perverting the sense of the letter of the Word; "a lion in secret places" signifies the interior natural man from the evils in him perverting every sense of the truth of the Word and thence of the church, which is the source of falsities; "he hath perverted my ways, he hath made me desolate," signifies the devastation of the truth of the church.</p><p>[16] In Amos:<p>Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah. What to you is the day of Jehovah? It is a day of darkness and not of light; as one who fleeth from a lion and meeteth a bear, or who cometh to a house and leaneth with his hand upon the wall and a serpent biteth him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_5_19.htm">19</a>).<p>"The day of Jehovah" means the coming of the Lord, who is the Messiah whom they expected; and as they believed that He would deliver them from the enemies of the land, and would exalt them in glory above all the nations, they desired Him. But as the Lord came into the world not for the sake of any kingdom on earth but for the sake of a kingdom in heaven, and as the Jewish nation was in the falsities of evil, and these were at that time manifested, it is said, "Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah. What to you is the day of Jehovah? It is a day of darkness and not of light," "darkness and not light" meaning the falsities in which they were; "as one who fleeth from a lion meeteth a bear" signifies fear because of the dominion of falsity when truths are sought from the sense of the letter of the Word, which they cannot but falsify; for one is said "to flee from a lion and to meet a bear" when he is interiorly in falsity from evil, and is led to investigate truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, which he then, because of the interior dominion of falsity from evil, cannot but pervert; "who cometh to a house and leaneth with his hand upon a wall and a serpent biteth him" signifies that when such a man in seeking goods consults the Word from the sense of the letter he does not see that evils pervert it; "the bite of a serpent" signifying falsification, here the falsification that arises from the interior dominion of falsity from evil.</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard with the kid; the calf shall lie down, and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little boy shall lead them; and the heifer and the bear shall feed, and their young ones shall lie down together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_7.htm">7</a>).<p>The signification of "the wolf dwelling with [the lamb, and the leopard with] the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling lying down together, and a little boy leading them," has been explained in the preceding article. "The heifer and the bear shall feed, and their young ones shall lie down together," signifies the power and eagerness of the natural man to falsify the truths of the Word, and that these shall do no harm to the good of the natural man and its affection, "heifer" meaning the affection for good and truth of the natural man, and "bear" the power and eagerness of the natural man to falsify the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word; "the lion shall eat straw like an ox" signifies that infernal falsity burning to destroy the truths of the church shall do no harm to the affection of good of the natural man, either as to the individual man in himself or as to men in relation to one another, nor shall it do harm to the Word, "straw" signifying the Word in the letter which is perverted by infernal falsity, but cannot be perverted by those who are in truths from good.</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>We grope for the wall as the blind, and we grope as they that have no eyes, we stumble in the noonday as in the twilight; among the living we are as dead; we growl like bears, and moaning we moan like doves; we wait for judgment but there is none, for salvation but it is far from us; for our transgressions before Thee are multiplied, and our sins answer against us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_10.htm">Isaiah 59:10-12</a>).<p>"We grope for the wall as the blind, and we grope as they that have no eyes," signifies that there is no understanding of truth; "we stumble in the noonday as in the twilight" signifies a falling into errors, although they are in the church where the Word is, by which they might come into the light of truth; "among the living we are as dead," signifies that they might be in spiritual life through the Word, and yet are not, because they are in falsities; "we growl like bears, and moaning we moan like doves," signifies the grief of the natural man, and the grief of the spiritual man therefrom; "we wait for judgment but there is none, for salvation but it is far from us," signifies a hope for the enlightenment of the understanding, and consequent salvation, but in vain; "our transgressions before <sup>1</sup>Thee are multiplied, and our sins answer against us," signifies by reason of falsities from evil.</p><p>[19] From this it can now be seen that a "bear" signifies the natural man in respect to its power from the sense of the letter of the Word, in both senses, also in respect to the eagerness to falsify that sense. That this is what a "bear" signifies has been made evident to me by the bears seen in the spiritual world, in whose form the thoughts of those were represented who had been natural, and had studied the Word, and had wished to prevail by means of knowledge therefrom. Bears were also seen that had ribs between their teeth, like the bear described in the passage cited above from Daniel; and it was given to understand that the ribs represented the knowledges that they had drawn from the Word while in the world. White bears also appear there, which represent the power of the spiritual-natural man through the Word. Furthermore, composite beasts appear there of bears, panthers, wolves, and oxen, also the same furnished with wings, which are all significative of persons of such character when they are passing along in meditation.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;the Latin has "before" for "against." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 781 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>781. "Et pedes ejus sicut ursi."

Haec sistuntur coram oculis eorum in variis formis, sicut in hortis, in silvis, in agris, in campis, et quoque in fontibus; tum in palatiis, domibus, et inibi conclavibus, in quibus decoramenta et utensilia; sistuntur etiam mensae, super quibus varii generis cibi: praeterea sistuntur illa in formis animalium terrae, volatilium caeli, et reptilium, infinita varietate; non modo in formis animalium et volatilium, qualia sunt super nostra tellure, sed etiam composita ex pluribus, quae nullibi in terris dantur, ex quibus mihi datum est videre plura: et cum illa apparent, noscitur statim ex qua origine spirituali sunt, ita quid significant: sed animalia et volatilia illa illico evanescunt, ut primum spiritus aut angelus desistit a cogitatione et meditatione sua.<p>[3] Quod talia in mundo spirituali appareant, manifeste constare potest a similibus visis a prophetis; ut quod Dominus apparuerit sicut Agnus; quod cherubi visi sint quoad facies sicut leo, sicut bos, et sicut aquila (de quibus apud Ezechielem); quod equi visi sint exeuntes ex Libro vitae, cum Agnus aperuit sigilla; tum Equus albus, ut et plures equi albi super quibus in caelo equitabant (apud Johannem); et quoque equi albi, <sup>1</sup></p><p>badii, rufi, nigri, grandinati (apud Sachariam); tum quoque quod visus sit draco rufus, cui plura capita et cornua; et hic nunc visa est bestia similis pardo, cum pedibus ursi, cui os leonis; ut et alia bestia, cui duo cornua similia agno; et, postea bestia coccinea super qua sedit mulier: visae etiam sunt Danieli quatuor bestiae ex mari ascendentes, quarum prima apparuit sicut leo cui alae aquilae, altera similis urso, tertia similis pardo, cui quatuor alae, et quarta terribilis. Ex quibus constare potest non modo quod tales bestiae in mundo spirituali appareant, sed etiam quod significent. Inde quoque videri potest quod omnes "bestiae", et quoque omnes "aves", quae memorantur in Verbo, significativae talium sint quae per bestias in mundo spirituali repraesentantur. Quid autem "ursus" significat, in sequentibus dicetur.<p>[4] Antequam in Verbo ostenditur quid significatur per "ursum", velim aliquot exemplis illustrare quid intelligitur per fallacias, quae per "pedes sicut ursi" hic significantur. Fallaciae dicuntur plura quae homo ratiocinatur et concludit ex naturali homine absque luce spirituali, quae est lux intellectus illustrati a Domino; naturalis enim homo suae cogitationis ideas capit ex terrestribus, corporeis et mundanis, quae in se sunt materiales; et quando cogitatio hominis non supra illas elevatur, materialiter cogitat de spiritualibus; et materialis cogitatio absque luce spirituali omne suum trahit ex amoribus naturalis hominis et ex eorum jucundis, quae contra amores caelestes et contra eorum jucunda sunt: inde est quod conclusa et ratiocinia ex solo naturali homine, et ejus fatuo lumine, sint fallaciae. Sed exempla illustrent.<p>[5] Fallacia est, Quod fides cogitativa salvet; cum tamen homo talis est qualis ejus vita est. Fallacia est, Quod fides cogitativa sit spiritualis; cum tamen amare Dominum super omnia, et proximum sicut se ipsum, sit ipsum spirituale; et amare est velle et facere. Fallacia est, Quod fides etiam momentanea detur; cum tamen homo purificandus est a malis et inde falsis, et regenerandus a Domino, quod diu perstat, et [sciendum est] quod sicut purificatur et regeneratur fidem spiritualem accipiat. Fallacia est, Quod homo possit recipere fidem et salvari in hora mortis, utcunque ejus vita fuerat; cum tamen vita hominem manet, et homo judicatur secundum facta et opera.<p>[6] Fallacia est, Quod fides per baptismum etiam sit infantibus; cum tamen fides comparanda est per cognitiones veri et boni, et per vitam secundum illas. Fallacia est, Quod per solam fidem ecclesia apud hominem; cum tamen per fidem charitatis est ecclesia apud illum, et charitas est vitae et non fidei separatae. Fallacia est, Quod homo per solam fidem justificetur, et quod justificato per illam meritum Domini imputetur, et quod postea illum nihil condemnet; cum tamen fides absque vita fidei, quae est charitas, est quasi dicatur vivum absque anima, quod in se est mortuum, nam charitas est anima fidei, quia est vita ejus; quare non justificatur homo per fidem mortuam; minus per illam imputatur meritum Domini, et fit salvatio; et ubi non salvatio, est condemnatio.<p>[7] Fallacia est, Quod soli fidei amor et charitas insit; cum tamen amor et charitas est velle et facere; quod enim homo amat, hoc non solum cogitat, sed etiam vult et facit. Fallacia est, Quod ubi legitur "facere" in Verbo, et ubi dicuntur "facta" et "opera", intelligatur fidem habere, quia fidei insunt; cum tamen distincta sunt sicut cogitatio et voluntas; potest enim homo cogitare multa quae non vult, et quod vult hoc cogitat cum sibi soli relictus est, ac velle est facere: voluntas etiam et inde cogitatio est ipse homo, et non cogitatio separata; ac facta et opera sunt voluntatis et inde cogitationis, at sola fides est cogitationis separatae a factis et operibus quae sunt voluntatis.<p>[8] Fallacia est, Quod fides separanda sit a bonis operibus, quia homo bonum a se non potest facere, et si; faciat quod ponat in eo meritum; cum tamen homo non bonum facit a se, sed ex Domino, cum ex Verbo, quia in Verbo est Dominus, et quoque Dominus est Verbum; et tunc homo non bonum facit a se, cum facit sicut a se, et usque credit quod ex Domino, quia ex Verbo; et quia credit quod bonum quod facit sit a Domino, non potest in factis meritum ponere. Fallacia est, Quod intellectus captivandus sit sub obedientia fidei, et quod fides visa intellectu non sit fides spiritualis; cum tamen intellectus est qui illustratur in rebus fidei cum legitur Verbum, et intellectus ab illustratione seclusus non scit num verum sit vel num falsum: inde fides nec fit fides ipsius, sed fides alterius in se; quae fides est fides historica, et cum confirmatur fit fides persuasiva, quae potest videre falsa ut vera, ac vera ut falsa; inde est fides omnium haeresium.<p>[9] Fallacia est, Quod fiducia, quae vocatur fides salvans, capta absque intellectu, sit fiducia spiritualis; cum tamen fiducia absque intellectu est persuasio ex alio, aut ex confirmatione per loca Verbi hic et ibi sparsim collecta, et per ratiocinia ex naturali homine falso principio applicata; talis fiducia caeca fides est, quae quia non videt num verum sit aut falsum, est mere naturalis: praeterea omne verum vult videri, quia est lucis caeli; at verum quod non videtur, potest multis falsificari, et verum falsificatum est falsum.</p><p>[10] Tales sunt fallaciae solummodo quoad fidem separatam a bonis operibus. Sunt adhuc plures, non modo quoad fidem, sed etiam quoad bona opera, quoad charitatem et quoad proximum, imprimis quoad conjunctiones illorum cum fide ab eruditis artificiose concinnatas. Quod tales fallaciae significentur per "pedes ursi", est quia per "ursum" significantur illi qui in potentia ex naturali sensu Verbi sunt, tam probi quam mali; et quia per "pedes" significantur naturalia, ideo per "pedes ursi" significantur fallaciae, ex quibus per ratiocinia falsificant sensum litterae Verbi, et in quas vertunt apparentias veri illius sensus.</p><p>[11] Quod "ursus" significet potentiam ex naturali sensu Verbi, tam apud probos quam apud malos, constare potest ex sequentibus: In Libro secundo Regum,<p>"Cum..Elisaeus ascenderet..Bethelem, ille ascendens in via, cum pueri exiverunt ex urbe, et illuserunt illi, et dixerunt illi, Ascende calve, ascende calve; et respexit post se, et vidit eos, et maledixit illis in nomine Jehovae; et exiverunt duae ursae e silva, et discerpserunt de iis quadraginta et duos pueros" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_781/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_2_23" target=_top>2:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_781/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_2_24" target=_top>24</a>):<p>cur pueri maledicti sunt ab Elisaeo, et ideo a binis ursis discerpti, quia vocarunt illum "calvum", non sciri potest nisi sciatur quid repraesentavit Elisaeus, et quid significat "calvus", tum quid significant "ursi." Quod non factum sit ab Elisaeo ex immoderata ira et injusta causa, constare potest ex eo, quod ille non tam immanis potuerit esse solum quia pueri parvi dixerunt, "Ascende calve"; erat quidem convitium in prophetam, sed non tale ut propterea ab ursis discerperentur. Sed ita factum est quia Elisaeus repraesentabat Dominum quoad Verbum, ita Verbum quod a Domino; per "calvum "significabatur Verbum orbatum sensu naturali, qui est sensus litterae ejus, et per "ursas e silva" significabatur potentia ex sensu naturali seu litterae Verbi, ut supra dictum est; et per "pueros" illos significabantur illi qui Verbum blasphemant propter sensum ejus naturalem, quia talis; per "quadraginta duo" significatur blasphematio. Inde nunc patet quod per illa repraesentata et inde significata sit poena blasphemationis Verbi. Omnis enim potentia et sanctitas Verbi residet collecta in ejus sensu litterae; si enim hic non foret, nec foret Verbum; nam sine eo foret Verbum sicut domus absque fundamento, quae vibraretur in aere, ac inde concideretur et dilaberetur; et foret Verbum sicut homo absque cute, quae circumtegit et continet viscera inclusa in suo situ et ordine; et quia tale significatur per "calvum", et per Elisaeum repraesentabatur Verbum, ideo pueri discerpti sunt ab ursis, per quas significabatur potentia ex naturali sensu Verbi, qui est sensus litterae, tam apud probos quam apud malos.

Quod David "apprehenderit barbam ursi", involvit arcanum, quod quidem aperiri potest, sed vix comprehendi: "barba" significat Divinum Verum in ultimis, in quo ipsa potentia ejus consistit; quod verum etiam mali qui in falsis sunt ore quidem ferunt, sed illo abutuntur ad destruendum; quo tamen ablato, non amplius illis aliqua potentia est; quare ursum occidit et leonem percussit; sed de hac re alibi plura. Per Goliathum autem, qui erat Philisthaeus, et inde vocatur "praeputiatus", significantur illi qui in veris absque bono sunt; et vera absque bono, sunt vera falsificata, quae in se falsa sunt: "praeputiatus" significat illos qui in spurcis amoribus corporeis sunt, nam praeputium illis amoribus correspondet; inde patet quid victoria Davidis super Goliathum repraesentabat.
