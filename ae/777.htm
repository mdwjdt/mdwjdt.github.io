<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 777</h4><p>777. And upon his horns ten diadems. That this signifies that power from the appearances of truth in abundance, is evident from the signification of horns, as denoting power, of which we have just above treated; and from the signification of ten, as denoting much, thus also abundance; concerning which see above (n. <a href="../ae/675.htm">675</a>); and from the signification of diadems, as denoting truths in the last degree of order, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word; concerning which also see above (n. <a href="../ae/717.htm">717</a>). They also denote the appearances of truth, because the truths of the letter of the Word are, for the most part, appearances of truth; and the power of those who are meant by the beast is therefrom. These are they who, by reasonings, confirm the separation of faith from life. For the truths of the letter of the Word - which are appearances of truth, which they also connect by reasonings so as to appear like genuine truths - are what are here signified by diadems. But when those truths are connected together by reasonings from falsities and fallacies, they are no longer truths in appearance, but truths falsified, and thus falsities; according to what was shown above (n. <a href="../ae/719.htm">719</a>), and illustrated by the apparent progression of the sun.<p>The reason why upon the heads of the dragon there appeared seven diadems, but upon the horns of the beast ten diadems is, that by the head of the dragon is signified a knowledge of the holy things of the Word, which are falsified and adulterated, thus truths in appearance, which are the truths of the letter of the Word; but by the horns are signified their great power when the same are connected together and confirmed by reasonings from the natural man. This great power, however, is not from reasonings, but by means of reasonings from the truths of the letter of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 777</h4><p>777. And upon his horns ten diadems, signifies power from appearances of truth in abundance. This is evident from the signification of "horns," as being power (of which just above); also from the signification of "ten," as being much, thus also abundance (See above, n. <a href="../ae/675.htm">675</a>); also from the signification of "diadems," as being truths in the ultimate of order, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word (See above, n. <a href="../ae/717.htm">717</a>). Appearances of truth are also meant, because the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are for the most part appearances of truth; and by means of these apparent truths of the Word those who are meant by this "beast" have their power. These are such as confirm by reasonings the separation of faith from life. For the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, which are appearances of truth, and which they connect by reasonings so as to make them to appear like genuine truths, are what are here signified by "diadems." But when these have been connected by reasonings from falsities and fallacies they are no longer apparent truths but truths falsified, and thus falsities; according to what was illustrated above (n. <a href="../ae/719.htm">719</a>) from the apparent progression of the sun. Upon the heads of the dragon there appeared seven diadems, but upon the horns of the beast ten diadems, because "the head of the dragon" signifies the knowledge [scientia] of the holy things of the Word which are falsified and adulterated, thus apparent truths which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word; while the "horns" signify their much power when these are connected and confirmed by reasonings from the natural man. Yet this much power is not from the reasonings, but through the reasonings from the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 777 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>777. "Et super cornibus suis decem diademata." Quod significet illam ex apparentiis veri in copia, constat ex significatione "cornuum", quod sint potentia (de qua mox supra); ex significatione "decem", quod sint multum, ita quoque copia (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_777/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_675" target=_top>675</a>); et ex significatione "diadematum", quod sint vera in ultimo ordinis, quae sunt vera sensus litterae Verbi (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_777/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_717" target=_top>717</a>): quod etiam sint apparentiae veri, est quia vera sensus litterae Verbi pleraque sunt apparentiae veri, et per illas Verbi est potentia illis qui per "bestiam" hanc intelliguntur, qui sunt qui per ratiocinia confirmant separationem fidei a vita; sunt enim vera sensus litterae Verbi, quae sunt apparentiae veri, quae per ratiocinia connectunt, ut appareant sicut genuina vera, quae per "diademata" hic significantur: sed quando illa connexa sunt per ratiocinia ex falsis et fallaciis, non amplius sunt vera apparentia, sed vera falsificata, ita falsa, secundum illa quae supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_777/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_719" target=_top>719</a>), ex solis apparente progressione, illustrata sunt. Quod, super capitibus draconis apparuerint "septem diademata", at super cornibus bestiae "decem diademata", est quia per "caput draconis" significatur scientia sanctorum Verbi, quae falsificata et adulterata sunt, ita vera apparentia quae sunt vera sensus litterae Verbi; at per "cornua" significatur eorum multa potentia, quando eadem per ratiocinia ex naturali homine connexa et confirmata sunt; at multa illa potentia non est ex ratiociniis, sed per ratiocinia ex veris sensus litterae Verbi. </p>
