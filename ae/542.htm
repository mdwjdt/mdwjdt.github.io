<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 542</h4><p>542. Verses 3-12. And out of the smoke came forth locusts [upon the earth]; and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was said to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but those men only which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should torment them five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man. And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. And the likenesses of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and on their heads as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails; and their power was to hurt men five months. And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss, his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he hath the name Apollyon. One woe is past; behold, there come two woes more hereafter.<p>"And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth," signifies, that from infernal falsities they became corporeal sensual in the church; "and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power," signifies their persuasiveness, and its effect and power. "And it was said to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree," signifies, that they should not hurt any true and living scientific from the sense of the letter of the Word, nor any cognitions of truth and good therein; "but those men only which have not the seal of God in their foreheads," signifies, but only the understanding of truth and perception of good with those who are not in truths from good from the Lord. "And to them it was given that they should not kill them," signifies, that they should not be deprived of the faculty of understanding truth and perceiving good; "but that they should torment them five months," signifies, that by the falsities of evil the understanding should be darkened and drawn away from seeing the truth so long as they are in that state; "and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man," signifies that the darkening and hindering from seeing the truth is from the persuasion with which the mind is infatuated. "And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not find it," signifies, that in such case they desire to destroy the power to understand truth, but that still they cannot; "and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them," signifies that they desire to destroy the power to perceive good, which belongs to spiritual life, but in vain. "And the likenesses of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war," signifies that man having become sensual reasons as though from understanding of truth; "and on their heads as it were crowns like gold," signifies that they seem to themselves, when they reason, to be wise and victorious; "and their faces were as the faces of men," signifies that they seem to themselves to be spiritual affections for truth. "And they had hair as the hair of women," signifies that they also seem to themselves to be natural affections for truth; "and their teeth were, as the teeth of lions," signifies that sensual things, which are the ultimates of the intellectual life, are to them apparently powerful over all things. "And they had breast-plates as it were breast-plates of iron," signifies the persuasions with which they gird themselves for combats, against which the truths of the spiritual rational man do not prevail; "and the voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to battle," signifies reasonings as though from truths of doctrine understood from the Word, for which they must zealously fight. "And they had tails like unto scorpions," signifies sensual scientifics which are persuasive; "and there were stings in their tails," signifies the craftiness of deceiving by means of them; "and their power was to hurt men five months," signifies that they would induce stupor as to the understanding of truth, and the perception of good, so long as they are in that state. "And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss," signifies that they received influx from the hell where are those who are in the falsities of evil and are purely sensual; "whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he hath the name Apollyon," signifies its quality, which is destructive of all truth and good. "One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter," signifies one lamentation over the devastation of the church, and that lamentation over its further devastation follows. </p>
