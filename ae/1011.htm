<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 1011</h4><p>1011. Verses 17, 18. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air, and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, out of the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and lightnings, and thunders, and a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake.<p>"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air," signifies the state of the church manifested as to all things of thought; "and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, out of the throne, saying, It is done," signifies manifestation out of heaven from the Lord that it is consummated, and thus that the Last Judgment is at hand.<p>"And there were voices, and lightnings, and thunders," signifies reasonings, darkening of the understanding, and the conclusions formed from falsities from evils; "and a great earthquake," signifies the state of the church entirely changed; "such as was not since men were on the earth," signifies that it was more inverted than hitherto in the countries, where the church is; "so great an earthquake," signifies so that the church was no more. </p>
