<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 637</h4><p>637. Clothed in sackcloth.- That this signifies in mourning because of the non-reception of Divine Good and Divine Truth, is evident from the signification of being clothed with sackcloth, as denoting mourning because of the vastation and desolation of Divine Good and Divine Truth, in this case, because they are not received. For the witnesses were seen clothed in sackcloth, and by the witnesses are signified the Divine Good, which is the source of all the good of love and of charity, and the Divine Truth, which is the source of all the truth of doctrine and of faith, and these appear in mourning when not received, but in joy when received.</p><p>[2] Similar expressions are used concerning the sun and the moon, which also signify the good of love and the truth of faith, as that<p>"The sun became black as a sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood" (<a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>). Not that the Sun in the angelic heaven, which is the Lord, ever becomes black, but that it appears to do so to those who do not receive any light from it.</p><p>[3] In ancient times, when the externals of the church consisted of pure correspondences, and thence representatives of spiritual things, mourning was represented by various significative actions; as sitting and lying on the ground, rolling themselves in the dust, putting ashes on the head, rending the garments, and putting on sackcloth. Rending the garments and putting on sackcloth signified mourning on account of the desolation of truth and good in the church, and on account of their non-reception. For garments in general signified the truths of the church, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/64.htm">64</a>, <a href="../ae/65.htm">65</a>, <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/271.htm">271</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>, <a href="../ae/475.htm">475:1</a>, <a href="../ae/476.htm">476</a>), and therefore the rending of the garments signified grief on account of injury to the truths of the church, and because they were rent asunder, as it were, by falsities. The putting on of sackcloth signified mourning on account of the deprivation of good and truth, and the consequent vastation of the church;</p><p>[4] therefore when Hezekiah the king heard the words of Tartan, the captain of the king of Assyria,<p>"He rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and came to the house of Jehovah; and he sent Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_19_1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_19_2.htm">2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_2.htm">2</a>).<p>This was done because the king of Assyria signifies there the perverted Rational, or the Rational which perverts the truths and goods of the church and destroys them by falsities, all the words of Tartan, the captain of the king of Assyria, involving such things. And because the desolation and vastation of the church was seen to be so imminent, therefore, in order to testify mourning and grief on account of it, they rent their garments and covered themselves with sackcloth.</p><p>[5] Similarly when Benhadad the king of Assyria besieged Samaria, and there came a great famine, "the king rent his garments, and as he passed by upon the wall, the people saw, that behold sackcloth was upon his flesh within" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_6_30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>). The signification is the same here as above, namely, imminent desolation and devastation of the church, therefore the king rent his garments, and had sackcloth upon his flesh, these being representative signs of mourning and grief.</p><p>[6] Mourning, for similar reasons, is also signified by what is written in other places. As for example, Jacob, when he believed that Joseph was torn to pieces, rent his garments, put sackcloth upon his loins, and, mourned over his son many days (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_37_34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>). Ahab, after he had taken away the vineyard of Naboth, by the advice of Jezebel his wife, and heard the severe words of the prophet concerning that matter, rent his garments, placed sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_21_27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>). Again, the king of Nineveh, after he had heard the words of Jonah, rose up from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth, sat upon ashes, and proclaimed a fast, and that man and beast should be covered with sackcloth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_3_5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_3_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_3_8.htm">8</a>). Also, Daniel set his face to the Lord God, to seek by supplication and prayer, in fasting, in sackcloth and ashes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_3.htm">Dan. 9:3</a>). And after Abner was slain, David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, that they should rend their garments and cover themselves with sackcloth, and lament before Abner; and David himself walked behind the bier (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_3_31.htm">2 Sam. 3:31</a>). From these passages it is evident that in the Jewish and Israelitish church mourning was represented by the rending of the garments and the putting on of sackcloth; and for the reason that grief of mind and mourning of heart, being interior, were at that time represented by external things, which were significative on account of their correspondence with spiritual things.</p><p>[7] That the representation of mourning by sackcloth especially signified mourning on account of the desolation of truth and the vastation of good in the church, and also, in particular, repentance, and then mourning of heart on account of evils, is further evident from the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"The Lord Jehovih Zebaoth shall call in that day to weeping and to wailing and to baldness, and to the putting on of sackcloth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_22_12.htm">22:12</a>).<p>The subject treated of in that chapter is the vastation of the church as to Divine Truth, and mourning on account of it is described by baldness and the putting on of sackcloth.</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>"The lion is gone up out of the thicket, and the destroyer of the nations is on his way, he hath gone forth out of his place to reduce the land to wasteness; thy cities shall be destroyed, that there shall be no inhabitant, for this gird ye with sackcloth, wail, howl" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_7.htm">4:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_8.htm">8</a>).<p>The lion out of the thicket signifies the falsity of evil destroying the truths of the church, and the destroyer of the nations signifies the evil of falsity destroying the good of the church; the land which they shall reduce to wasteness signifies the church, and by the cities which shall be destroyed are signified the truths of doctrine. By girding with sackcloth is signified mourning on account thereof, and therefore it is also added, wail and bowl.</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>"O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and roll thee in ashes; make to thee the mourning of an only son, a wailing of bitterness, for the vastator will come suddenly upon us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_26.htm">6:26</a>).<p>By the daughter of my people is meant the church; by girding herself with sackcloth and rolling herself in ashes is signified mourning on account of the destruction of the good and truth of the church; the destruction of these, or the vastation of the church, is meant by the vastator coming suddenly. That great mourning and grief on account of the destruction of the good and truth of the church is signified by girding with sackcloth and rolling in ashes, is evident, for it is added, "make to thee the mourning of an only son, a wailing of bitterness."</p><p>[10] Again:<p>"Howl, O Heshbon, because Ai is devastated; cry out, O daughters of Rabbah; gird ye with sackcloth, wail, and wander among the fences; because their king is gone into exile, his priests and princes together" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>).<p>These things are said concerning the sons of Ammon, who signify those who are in natural good and falsify the truths of the church. Those in the church who are of such a character are described by "the daughters of Rabbah." Gird ye with sackcloth, wail, wander amongst the fences, signifies mourning on account of the destruction of truth by falsifications, fences denoting truths falsified. Because their king is gone into exile, signifies that the truth of the church consequently perished, king denoting the truth of the church, and to go into exile signifying to be destroyed; that also the goods of the church, and thence all truths perished, is signified by the priests and the princes together, priests denoting the goods of the church, and princes truths thence.</p><p>[11] In Lamentations:<p>"They sit upon the earth, the elders of the daughter of Zion keep silence, they have cast up dust upon their head, they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem have hung down their heads to the earth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_10.htm">2:10</a>).<p>To sit upon the earth, to keep silence, to cast up dust upon the head, and to hang down the head to the earth, were all signs representative of mourning and grief on account of the vastation of the church by evils and falsities. The elders of the daughter of Zion signify the wise and intelligent in the church, and, in the abstract, wisdom and intelligence. The daughters of Zion and the virgins of Jerusalem signify those in the church who are in the affection for good and truth, and, in the abstract, those affections themselves.</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>The shipmasters "shall make themselves bald for thee, and shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and they shall weep over thee with bitterness of soul, with a bitter wailing" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_1.htm">1</a>).<p>These words refer to Tyre, which signifies the church as to the knowledges of truth and good, consequently also the knowledges of truth and good that pertain to the church. Here mourning is described because those knowledges are lost. The shipmasters signify all those who bring and communicate those knowledges. To make bald signifies mourning because every thing pertaining to intelligence is destroyed; to gird with sackcloth signifies mourning because the cognition of truth also is destroyed. Because mourning is that which is described, it is therefore added, "they shall weep over thee with bitterness of soul, with bitter wailing."</p><p>[13] In the Evangelists:<p>Wo to thee, Chorazin, wo to thee, Bethsaida, for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in You, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_13.htm">Luke 10:13</a>).<p>To repent in sackcloth and ashes means to grieve and mourn on account of the non-reception of Divine Truth, and on account of the falsities and evils which oppose.</p><p>[14] In Joel:<p>"Howl as a virgin girded with sackcloth over the bridegroom of her youth; gird yourselves about and wail, ye priests, howl ye ministers of the altar; come, pass the night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God, because the meat-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_8.htm">1:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_13.htm">13</a>).<p>Here also to be girded with sackcloth, and to pass the night in sackcloth, signifies mourning because the good and truth of the church are destroyed, for the meat-offering signifies the good of the church, and the drink-offering its truth.</p><p>[15] In Amos:<p>"I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head, and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and its end as a bitter day" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_10.htm">8:10</a>).<p>Sackcloth upon the loins signifies mourning because the good of love is destroyed, for this is signified by the loins; and baldness upon the head signifies mourning because the understanding of truth is destroyed.</p><p>[16] In Isaiah:<p>Upon all the heads" of Moab "baldness, every beard shaven in the streets thereof they have girded themselves with sackcloth; upon the roofs thereof, and in the streets thereof, he shall howl, going down into weeping" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_2.htm">15:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_3.htm">3</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Every head baldness, and every beard shaven; upon all hands ashes, and upon the loins sackcloth; upon all the roofs of Moab, and in the streets thereof, mourning everywhere" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_37.htm">48:37</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_38.htm">38</a>).<p>By Moab are signified those who are in natural good and adulterate the goods of the church. That they have no understanding of truth, nor knowledge of truth, is signified by baldness upon all the heads of Moab, and by every beard shaven, also by howling and mourning upon the roofs and in the streets. Ashes upon all hands signify things falsified; mourning on account of this is signified by girding on sackcloth, also by howling and going down into weeping.</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>"It shall come to pass, instead of spices, shall be corruption, and instead of a girdle, a rent, and instead of braided work, baldness, and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth, burning instead of beauty; thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy strength in the war" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_24.htm">3:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_25.htm">25</a>).<p>These things are said of the daughters of Zion, who signify the church as to the affections for celestial good, consequently by the daughters of Zion are signified the affections for good pertaining to the celestial church. The loss and dissipation of these through the pride of [man's] own intelligence is there described by the various things with which those daughters adorn themselves. Instead of spices shall be corruption, instead of a girdle, a rent, instead of braided work, baldness, instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth, and instead of beauty, burning, signifies the changing of their affections into those of a contrary and unbeautiful kind. By corruption is signified the perishing of what is vital. By a rent instead of a girdle is signified the dissipation of the perceptions of truth, instead of the union of them; by baldness instead of braided work is signified foolishness instead of knowledge; by burning instead of beauty is signified folly instead of intelligence, burning denoting the insanity that arises from pride in [one's] own intelligence, which is folly, while beauty denotes intelligence. Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy strength in the war signifies that the truths of the understanding would perish by means of falsities, until there would be no resistance against evils, the sword denoting falsity destroying the truth.</p><p>[18] Sackcloth signifies the same in the following passages; as in Ezekiel:<p>"All hands are let down, all knees go into waters, whence they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and terror shall cover them, and upon all faces shall be shame, and upon all heads baldness" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_17.htm">7:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_18.htm">18</a>).<p>In David:<p>"I, when they were sick, made my garment sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with hunger" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>).<p>Again:<p>"When I wept in the fast of my soul, it became to me a reproach; when I made sackcloth my garment, I became a byword to them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_69_10.htm">Psalm 69:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_69_11.htm">11</a>).<p>In Job:<p>"I sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and put tiny horn in the dust; my face was troubled through weeping" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_16_15.htm">16:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/acts-of-the-apostles_16_16.htm">16</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_50_3.htm">50:3</a>).<p>And in David:<p>"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing, thou hast opened my sackcloth, and hast girded me with joy" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_30_11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>).<p>In these passages also sackcloth signifies mourning and to gird sackcloth upon the body instead of a garment signifies mourning because the truth of the church is destroyed; and to gird sackcloth upon the loins and upon the flesh signifies mourning because the good of the church is destroyed. For a garment signifies the truth of the church, and the loins and flesh signify the good of the church.</p><p>[19] That to gird on sackcloth was merely representative and thence significative of mourning and repentance, but was not itself either mourning or repentance, is evident in Isaiah:<p>"Is it such a fast as this that I shall choose, a day for a man to afflict his soul, to bow down his head as a rush, and to lie down in sackcloth and ashes; wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah? Is not this the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of wickedness, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to bring the afflicted exiles to thy house, and when thou seest the naked that thou cover him?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_58_5.htm">58:5-7</a>).<p>In Joel:<p>"Turn ye unto me with your whole heart, and in fasting, and in weeping, and in wailing; and rend your heart, and not your garments" (ii.<p>[12,] 13). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 637</h4><p>637. Clothed in sackcloth, signifies in mourning because of the non-reception of Divine good and Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of "clothed in sackcloth," as being mourning because of the vastation and desolation of Divine good and Divine truth, here because of their non-reception; for the witnesses were seen clothed in sackcloth, and they signify the Divine good, from which is every good of love and charity, and the Divine truth, from which is every truth of doctrine and faith; these appear to be in mourning when they are not received, but in joy when they are received.</p><p>[2] Likewise it is said of the sun and moon, which also signify the good of love and the truth of faith, that:<p>The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood (<a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>); not that the sun in the angelic heaven, which is the Lord, ever becomes black, but that it so appears to those who receive no light from it.</p><p>[3] In ancient times, when the externals of the church consisted of mere correspondences and thence of representatives of things spiritual, mourning was represented by many things that are significative; as by sitting and lying on the ground, rolling themselves in the dust, by putting ashes on the head, rending the garments, and putting on sackcloth. "Rending the garments and putting on sackcloth" signified mourning because of the desolation of truth and good in the church, and because of the nonreception of them; for "garments" in general signified the truths of the church (See above, n. <a href="../ae/64.htm">64</a>, <a href="../ae/65.htm">65</a>, <a href="../ae/195.htm">195</a>, <a href="../ae/271.htm">271</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>, <a href="../ae/475.htm">475</a>, <a href="../ae/476.htm">476</a>); therefore "rending the garments" signified grief because the truths of the church are hurt and as it were rent asunder by falsities; and "to be clothed in sackcloth" signifies mourning because of the deprivation of good and truth, and the consequent vastation of the church.</p><p>[4] For this reason:<p>When Hezekiah the king heard the words of Tartan the captain of the king of Assyria, he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and came to the house of Jehovah; and he sent Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_19_1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_19_2.htm">2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_2.htm">2</a>).<p>This was done because the "king of Assyria" here signifies the perverted rational, or the rational that perverts the truths and goods of the church and destroys them by falsities; all the words of Tartan the captain of the king of Assyria, involve such things; and because the desolation and vastation of the church was seen to be imminent, to exhibit mourning and grief on this account they rent their garments and covered themselves with sackcloth.</p><p>[5] Likewise:<p>When Benhadad the king of Syria besieged Samaria, and there came a great famine, the king rent his clothes, and as he passed by upon the wall the people saw that, behold, sackcloth was upon his flesh within (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_6_30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>).<p>This has a similar signification as above, namely, the imminent desolation and devastation of the church; for this reason the king rent his garments and had sackcloth upon his flesh, which was a representative sign of mourning and grief.</p><p>[6] Mourning for like reasons is signified also by the following:<p>Jacob, when he believed that Joseph was torn to pieces, rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_37_34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>).<p>So when Ahab, by the advice of Jezebel his wife, had taken away the vineyard of Naboth, and had heard the hard words of the prophet respecting that matter, he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, yea, he lay in sackcloth, and went softly (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_21_27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>).<p>The king of Nineveh also, when he heard the words of Jonah, arose up from his throne, and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth, and sat upon ashes, and proclaimed a fast, and that man and beast should be covered with sackcloth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_3_5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_3_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jonah_3_8.htm">8</a>).<p>So also Daniel set his face to the Lord God, to seek by supplication and prayer in fasting, sackcloth, and ashes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>).<p>When Abner was slain, David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him, that they should rend their clothes and gird them with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner; and David himself walked behind the bier (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_3_31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>).<p>This makes clear that in the Jewish and Israelitish church mourning was represented by "rending the clothes and being clothed in sackcloth;" and this because grief of mind and mourning of heart, which were interior things, were represented at that time by external things, which because of their correspondences with spiritual things were significative.</p><p>[7] That the representation of mourning by sackcloth signified especially mourning because of the desolation of truth and vastation of good in the church, and also, in particular, repentance, with mourning of heart on account of evils, can be seen further from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>In that day will the Lord Jehovih of hosts call to weeping and to lamenting, and to baldness, and to girding on sackcloth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_22_12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>).<p>This chapter treats of the vastation of the church in respect to Divine truth; its mourning is described by "baldness" and by "putting on sackcloth."</p><p>[8] In Jeremiah:<p>The lion is gone up from the thicket, and the destroyer of nations journeyeth; he hath gone forth out of his place to make the land a waste; thy cities shall be destroyed, that there shall be no inhabitant; for this gird ye with sackcloth, lament, howl (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_4_8.htm">8</a>).<p>"The lion from the thicket" signifies the falsity of evil destroying the truths of the church; and "the destroyer of nations" signifies the evil of falsity destroying the good of the church; the "land that they will make a waste" signifies the church, and the "cities that shall be destroyed" signify the truths of doctrine; "to gird with sackcloth" signifies mourning on this account, therefore it is added "lament and howl."</p><p>[9] In the same:<p>O daughter of My people, gird thee with sackcloth and roll thee in ashes; make thee mourning for an only one, a lamentation of bitterness, for the waster shall suddenly come upon us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_6_26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>).<p>"Daughter of the people" means the church; "to gird herself with sackcloth and roll herself in ashes" signifies mourning because of the destruction of the good and truth of the church; the destruction of these or the vastation of the church is meant by "the waster shall suddenly come." Evidently grievous mourning and grief because of the destruction of good and truth is signified by "gird thee with sackcloth and roll thee in ashes," for it is added "make thee mourning for an only one, a lamentation of bitterness."</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry out, ye daughters of Rabbah; gird ye with sackcloth, lament, and wander among the walls; for their king is gone into exile, his priests and princes together (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_49_3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>).<p>This is said of the sons of Ammon, who signify such as are in natural good and falsify the truths of the church; those who are such in the church are meant by "the daughters of Rabbah;" mourning because of the destruction of truth by falsifications is signified by "Gird ye with sackcloth, lament, wander among the walls," "walls" signifying truths falsified; that the truth of the church perished in consequence is signified by "their king is gone into exile," "king" signifying the truth of the church, and "to go into exile" signifying to be destroyed. That the goods of the church and all truths therefrom likewise perished, is signified by "priests and princes together," "priests" signifying the goods of the church, and "princes" the truths therefrom.</p><p>[11] In Lamentations:<p>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the earth, they keep silence, they have cast up dust upon their head, they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem bend their head down to the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/lamentations_2_10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>).<p>"To sit upon the earth," "to keep silence," "to cast up dust upon the head," and "to make the head to bend down to the earth," were all signs representative of mourning and grief because of the vastation of the church by evils and falsities. "The elders of the daughter of Zion" signify those that are wise and intelligent in the church, and in an abstract sense wisdom and intelligence; "daughters of Zion and the virgins of Jerusalem" signify those in the church who are in the affection of good and truth, and in an abstract sense these affections themselves.</p><p>[12] In Ezekiel:<p>The shipmasters shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep over thee in bitterness of soul, with bitter lamentation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_27_31.htm">Ezekiel 27:31</a>).<p>This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and therefore also the knowledges of truth and good which belong to the church; here mourning on account of the destruction of these is described. "Shipmasters" signify all who bring and communicate these knowledges; "to make bald" signifies mourning on account of the destruction of all things of intelligence; "to gird with sackcloth" signifies mourning because the ability to know truth is also destroyed. Because mourning is what is described, it is added, "they shall weep over thee in bitterness of soul, with bitter lamentation. "</p><p>[13] In the Gospels:<p>Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida, for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_13.htm">Luke 10:13</a>).<p>"To repent in sackcloth and ashes" means to grieve and mourn because of the nonreception of Divine truth, and because of the falsities and evils that obstruct.</p><p>[14] In Joel:<p>Howl as a virgin girded with sackcloth for the bridegroom of her youth; gird ye and lament, ye priests; howl, ye ministers of the altar; come, pass the night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God, for the meal offering and the drink offering are withholden from the house of your God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_1_13.htm">13</a>).<p>Here "to be girded with sackcloth" and "to pass the night in sackcloth" signify mourning because the good and truth of the church are destroyed, for the "meal offering" signifies the good of the church, and the "drink offering" its truth.</p><p>[15] In Amos:<p>I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head, and I will make it as a mourning for an only one, and its latter end as a bitter day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_8_10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>).<p>"Sackcloth upon the loins" signifies mourning because the good of love is destroyed, for this is signified by the "loins;" and "baldness upon the head" signifies mourning because the understanding of truth is destroyed.</p><p>[16] In Isaiah:<p>Upon all the heads of Moab is baldness, every beard shaven; in its streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl, flowing down in weeping (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_15_3.htm">3</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Every head baldness, and every beard shaven; upon all hands gashes, and upon the loins sackcloth; upon all the roofs of Moab and in its streets mourning everywhere (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_38.htm">38</a>).<p>"Moab" signifies those who are in natural good and who adulterate the goods of the church; that such have no understanding of truth or knowledge of truth is signified by "upon all the heads of Moab baldness, and every beard shaven," also by "upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl" and "there shall be mourning;" "upon all hands gashes" signifies things falsified; mourning because of these things is signified by "to gird with sackcloth," and "to howl," and "to flow down in weeping."</p><p>[17] In Isaiah:<p>It shall come to pass in place of spices there shall be rottenness, and in place of a girdle tatters, and in place of braided work baldness, and in place of a robe a girding of sackcloth, in place of beauty burning; thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy might in the war (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_3_25.htm">25</a>).<p>This is said of "the daughters of Zion," by whom the church in respect to the affections of celestial good is signified, therefore "the daughters of Zion" signify the affections of good that belong to the celestial church. The loss and dissipation of these through the pride of self-intelligence is here described by the various things with which these daughters adorn themselves; the change of these affections into opposite and unbeautiful affections is signified by "in place of spices there shall be rottenness, in place of a girdle tatters, in place of braided work baldness, in place of a robe a girding of sackcloth, and in place of beauty burning;" "rottenness" signifies the vital perishing; "in place of a girdle tatters" signifies the dissipation of perceptions of truth instead of their union; "in place of braided work baldness" signifies imbecility instead of knowledge [scientia]; "in place of beauty burning" signifies foolishness instead of intelligence, "burning" signifying insanity from the pride of self-intelligence, which is foolishness, and "beauty" signifying intelligence. That the truths of the understanding will perish by falsities, even till there is no resistance against evils, is signified by "thy men shall fall by the sword and thy might in the war," "sword" meaning falsity destroying the truth.</p><p>[18] "Sackcloth" has a similar meaning in the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>All hands are relaxed, all knees go into waters, whence they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and terror shall cover them, and upon all faces shall be shame, and upon all heads baldness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_7_18.htm">18</a>).<p>In David:<p>I, when they were sick, made sackcloth my vesture, I afflicted my soul with hunger (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_13.htm">Psalms 35:13</a>).<p>When I wept in the fast of my soul it became to me a reproach; when I made sackcloth my garment I became a byword to them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_69_10.htm">Psalms 69:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_69_11.htm">11</a>).<p>In Job:<p>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have put my horn in the dust; my face has been soiled by weeping (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_16_15.htm">Job 16:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_16_16.htm">16</a>).<p>In Isaiah:<p>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_50_3.htm">Isaiah 50:3</a>).<p>And in David:<p>Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing, thou hast loosed my sackcloth and hast girded me with joy (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_30_11.htm">Psalms 30:11</a>).<p>In these passages, too, "sackcloth" signifies mourning; and "to gird sackcloth over the body instead of the vesture" signifies mourning because of the destruction of the truth of the church; and "to gird sackcloth upon the loins and upon the flesh" signifies mourning because of the destruction of the good of the church; for "the vesture" signifies the truth of the church, and "loins and flesh" signify the good of the church.</p><p>[19] That "girding with sackcloth" was merely representative and thus significative of mourning and repentance, but was not in itself mourning and repentance, is evident in Isaiah:<p>Is such the fast that I shall choose, the day for a man to afflict his soul, to bow down his head as a rush, and to lie down in sackcloth and ashes; wilt thou call this a fast, and the day of Jehovah's good pleasure? Is not this the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of wickedness, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to bring the afflicted exiles to the home, and when thou seest the naked that thou cover him? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_58_5.htm">Isaiah 58:5-7</a>)<p>And in Joel:<p>Turn ye back unto me with your whole heart, and in fasting and in weeping and in lamentation, and rend your heart and not your garments (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joel_2_13.htm">13</a>). </p>

"Circuminduti saccis." - Quod significet in luctu propter non receptionem Divini Boni ac Divini Veri, constat ex significatione "indui saccis", quod sit luctus propter vastationem et desolationem Divini Boni et Divini Veri; hic propter non receptionem eorum, nam "testes" visi sunt induti saccis, et per illos significatur Divinum Bonum ex quo omne bonum amoris et charitatis, ac Divinum Verum ex quo omne verum doctrinae et fidei;

sicut per quod sederent et jacerent humi, quod volverent se in pulvere, quod cinerem imponerent capiti, quod discinderent vestes, et quod induerent saccos: quod "disciderint vestes et induerint saccos" significabat luctum propter desolationem veri et boni in ecclesia, et propter non receptionem eorum;

"et calvities super caput" significat luctum ob deperditum intellectum veri.</p><p>[16] Apud Esaiam,<p>#"In omnibus capitibus" Moabi "calvities, omnis barba rasa, in plateis ejus accinxerunt saccum, super tectis ejus et in plateis ejus ejulabit, descendens in fletum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_15_2" target=_top>15:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_15_3" target=_top>3</a>);<p>apud Jeremiam,<p>#Omne caput calvities, et omnis barba rasa, super omnibus manibus incisiones, et super lumbis saccus, super omnibus tectis Moabi, et in plateis ejus totus luctus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_48_37" target=_top>48:37</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_48_38" target=_top>38</a>):<p>per "Moabum" significantur illi qui in bono naturali sunt, et adulterant bona ecclesiae; quod intellectus veri illis nullus sit, nec scientia veri, significatur per quod "in omnibus capitibus Moabi calvities, et omnis barba rasa", tum per quod "in tectis ejus et in plateis ejus ejulabit" et "erit luctus": "incisiones super omnibus manibus" significant falsificata; luctus propterea significatur per "accingere saccum", tum per "ejulare" et "descendere in fletum."</p><p>[17] Apud Esaiam,<p>#"Fiet, loco aromatis tabes erit, et loco cinguli discissio, et loco operis implexi calvities, et loco togae cinctura sacci, adustio loco pulchritudinis;

proinde per "filias Zionis significantur affectiones boni quae sunt ecclesiae caelestis: jactura et dissipatio illarum per fastum propriae intelligentiae describitur ibi per varia quibus filiae illae se exornant; mutatio illarum affectionum in contrarias et impulchras significatur per quod "loco aromatis tabes, loco cinguli discissio, loco operis implexi calvities, loco togae cinctura sacci, et loco pulchritudinis adustio"; per "tabem" significatur periens vitale; per "discissionem loco cinguli" significatur dissipatio perceptionum veri loco connexionis illarum; per "calvitiem loco operis implexi" significatur fatuitas loco scientiae; per "adustionem loco pulchritudinis" significatur stultitia loco intelligentiae ("adustio" significat insaniam ex fastu propriae intelligentiae quae est stultitia, et "pulchritudo" significat intelligentiam): quod vera intellectus peritura sint per falsa, usque ut nulla resistentia sit contra mala, significatur per quod "homines tui gladio cadent, et robur tuum in bello"; "gladius" est falsum destruens verum.</p><p>[18] Similia per "saccum" significantur in his sequentibus :<p>Apud Ezechielem,<p>#"Omnes manus remissae, omnia genua abeunt in aquas, unde accingent saccos, et colliget eos terror, et super omnibus faciebus pudor, et in omnibus capitibus..calvities" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_7_17" target=_top>7:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_7_18" target=_top>18</a>);<p>apud Davidem,<p>#Ego, cum illi aegrotarent, vestis mea saccus, afflixi fame animam meam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_637/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_35_13" target=_top>Psalms 35:13</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>#"Cum flevi in jejunio animae meae, factum mihi est in opprobria;
