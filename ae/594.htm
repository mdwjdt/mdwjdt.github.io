<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 594</h4><p>594. Encompassed with a cloud.- That this signifies the ultimate of the Word, is evident from the signification of being encompassed, as denoting what is outside of one, for that which is around is also outside, since it is beyond in the circumference; in this case therefore it denotes the ultimate; and from the signification of a cloud, as denoting Divine Truth in the ultimates, consequently the Word in the sense of the letter. This signification of cloud is evident from appearances in the spiritual world; also from the Word, where clouds are mentioned. From appearances in the spiritual world, as follows; the whole angelic heaven consists solely of the Divine Truth which proceeds from the Lord, the reception of which makes angels. In the highest heaven this truth appears like the pure aura which is called ether; in the lower heaven, as less pure, almost like the atmosphere, which is called air; in the lowest heaven it appears like a thin watery element, upon which vapour rests like a cloud. Such is the appearance of Divine Truth according to degrees in descent. A similar appearance is seen when the angels of the higher heavens speak concerning Divine truths, their discourse, in such case, appearing to the sight of those who are in the lowest heaven under the aspect of a cloud, which flies hither and thither, while the more intelligent among them know from its motion, brightness, and form, what the angels of the higher heavens are mutually discoursing about. The reason why a cloud signifies Divine Truth in ultimates is therefore evident. Because many expressions in the Word are chosen from appearances in the spiritual world, and consequently have a similar signification, therefore this is the case also with respect to clouds.</p><p>[2] That a cloud signifies in the Word the sense of the letter, which is Divine Truth in ultimates, is evident from the following passages.<p>Thus in Matthew:<p>"Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John up to a high mountain, and was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. While Peter "was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, hear ye him" (<a href="../njhd/303.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 303</a>, <a href="../njhd/304.htm">304</a>, <a href="../njhd/305.htm">305</a>, <a href="../njhd/306.htm">306</a>), and that the Lord is the Word (n. <a href="../njhd/263.htm">263</a>). For this reason all the circumstances of the transfiguration of the Lord, signify Divine Truth proceeding from the Divine Good of the Lord. The Divine Good of the Divine Love, which was in Him, and from which was the Divine Truth in His Human, was represented by His face shining as the sun, for the face represents the interiors, therefore these shine forth through the face, and the sun signifies the Divine Love; see above (n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401:3</a>, 412:1-10). The Divine Truth was represented by the Lord's garments which were like the light. Garments in the Word signify truths, and the garments of the Lord the Divine Truth; see above (n. <a href="../ae/64.htm">64</a>, <a href="../ae/271.htm">271</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>); on this account also they appeared like the light; for Divine Truth is the cause of light in the angelic heaven, and is therefore signified by light in the Word; concerning which more may be seen in <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>). Because the Word, which is the Divine Truth, was represented, therefore Moses and Elias were seen speaking with him, Moses and Elias signifying the Word, Moses the historical, and Elias the prophetical Word; but the Word in the letter was represented by the cloud which overshadowed the disciples, and into which they entered. For the disciples, in the Word, represented the church, which, at that time and afterwards, was only in truths from the sense of the letter. And because revelation and responses are given by means of the Divine Truth in ultimates, as stated in the article above, and this truth is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, therefore a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him," denoting that He is the Divine Truth, or the Word.</p><p>[3] He who does not know that a cloud in the spiritual sense of the Word means the Word in the letter, cannot know the interior truth involved in these words; That in the consummation of the age "they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory" (<a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a>); and the revelation itself of the spiritual sense, in the White Horse; the Son of man also signifies the Lord as to Divine Truth, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>, <a href="../ae/151.htm">151</a>).</p><p>[4] That a cloud signifies the Divine Truth in ultimates, consequently the Word in the sense of the letter, is still further evident from the following passages.<p>Thus in Isaiah:<p>"Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, and cometh into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt are put in commotion before Him, and the heart of the Egyptian melteth in the midst of him " (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">19:1</a>).<p>By Egypt in these words is not meant Egypt, but the natural man separated from the spiritual, which is then in falsities and evils, and by means of these perverts all the truths and goods of the church. That those falsities and evils destroy it, when truth from good flows in from the Lord, is described by these words of the prophet understood in the internal sense. Jehovah riding upon a light cloud, signifies the Lord enlightening the understanding with truths, to ride, when used in reference to Jehovah, or the Lord, denoting to enlighten the understanding, and a light cloud denoting truth; that then the idols of Egypt are put in commotion, and the heart of the Egyptian melteth, signifies, that the evils and falsities of the natural man separated from the spiritual, then destroy him, idols denoting falsities, the heart denoting evils, and Egypt, the natural man.</p><p>[5] So in Moses:<p>"There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth in heaven and in his magnificence upon the clouds, the dwelling-place of the God of antiquity, and underneath (are) the arms of the world" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_27.htm">27</a>).<p>Here also by riding in the heaven on the clouds, is signified to enlighten the understanding by the influx of spiritual truth into natural truth, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word. Because the Divine Truth in the heavens is spiritual, and the Divine Truth in the earths (terris) is natural, and the latter is enlightened by the former, therefore it is said, "and in his magnificence upon the clouds." "The dwelling-place of the God of antiquity," denotes the Divine Truth with the angels, while the expression "the arms of the world" denotes truths with men; the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are meant by the arms of the world, for that sense is the very strength of Divine Truth, arms signifying strength. That the strength of Divine Truth is in the sense of the letter of the Word may be seen in the article above.</p><p>[6] So in David:<p>God "rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea he was carried upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his hiding-place; his pavilion round about him, darkness of waters, clouds of the heavens. At the brightness before him the clouds passed" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalm 18:10-12</a>).<p>Here also the enlightenment of the Word is described, and thence the enlightenment of the church. Enlightenment by the influx of Divine Truth out of the heavens is signified by, he rode upon a cherub, and did fly. Divine truth in ultimates, which is enlightened, is signified by the wings of the wind, darkness of waters, and clouds of the heavens; the various degrees of the understanding which receives enlightenment are signified by those things. That the obscurities of the ultimate sense are consequently removed, is meant by, at the brightness before him the clouds passed.</p><p>[7] So again:<p>"Sing unto God, praise his name; extol him that rideth upon the clouds" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a>).<p>By Him that rideth upon the clouds, is here also meant the Lord as to enlightenment. Clouds denote truths in the ultimates, which are enlightened, and this enlightenment takes place by the influx of light, which is Divine Truth, out of the spiritual world or heaven.</p><p>[8] So in Nahum:<p>"The way of Jehovah is in storms and tempest, and the clouds are the dust of his feet" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_3.htm">1:3</a>).<p>Truth in ultimates, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, is called the clouds, the dust of the feet of Jehovah, because it is the natural and lowest [truth], in which the Divine Truth in heaven, which is spiritual, terminates, and upon which also it subsists. Divine Truth in ultimates, because little understood unless it be enlightened out of heaven, and therefore a ground of disputation and controversy, is meant by the storm and the tempest, in which is the way of Jehovah, spiritual storm and tempest denoting disputation concerning the genuine sense [of the Word], which nevertheless the Lord enlightens by influx in the case of those who desire the truth.</p><p>[9] So in David:<p>"His seed shall be for ever, and his throne as the sun before thee. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in the clouds" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_36.htm">89:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_37.htm">37</a>).<p>These things are said of the Lord, and by the seed which shall endure for ever, is signified the Divine Truth from Him. His throne which shall be as the sun, and as the moon, signifies heaven and the church, as to the good of love, and as to the truth of faith; throne signifies heaven and the church, "as the sun" signifies as to the good of love, and "as the moon" signifies as to the truth of faith. A faithful witness in the clouds, signifies that He is the Divine Truth; for "witness," when used in reference to the Lord, signifies that which goes forth from Him, and this bears witness concerning Him because it is of Him.</p><p>[10] Again:<p>Jehovah "layeth his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind" (<a href="../ae/71.htm">71</a>, <a href="../ae/483.htm">483</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>, <a href="../ae/537.htm">537</a>, <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>).</p><p>[11] So in Isaiah:<p>"I will lay" my vineyard "waste; I will even command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_5.htm">5:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_6.htm">6</a>).<p>These words mean that then there shall be no understanding of Divine Truth or the Word in the church; the vineyard denotes the church, clouds denote the Word in the letter, and by their raining no rain, is meant that there shall be no understanding of Divine Truth from the Word.</p><p>[12] Again, in David:<p>Jehovah, "who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>).<p>To cover the heavens with clouds, signifies to defend and keep together the spiritual things of the Word which are in the heavens, by natural truths such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word. Who prepareth rain for the earth, signifies instruction thence for the church; who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains, signifies nourishment by means of it for those who are in the good of love.</p><p>[13] The same is signified by the following words in Isaiah:<p>"Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds pour down with justice; let the earth open, and bring forth salvation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_8.htm">45:8</a>).<p>And in Judges:<p>"Jehovah, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedest out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens also dropped, the clouds also dropped waters" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_4.htm">5:4</a>).<p>Going forth out of Seir, and marching out of the field of Edom, signifies in reference to Jehovah, the enlightenment of the Gentiles by the Lord, when He assumed the Human. By the earth trembling, is signified the completely changed state of the church at that time. By the heavens dropping, and the clouds dropping waters, are signified instruction, influx, and the perception of Divine Truth; to drop signifies instruction and influx, water denotes truths, the heavens denote the interior things of truth, and clouds, the exterior, such as they are in the sense of the letter of the Word.</p><p>[14] Again, in David:<p>"The clouds dropped waters; the skies uttered a voice, thy darts also went forth" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_17.htm">Psalms 77:17</a>).<p>By the clouds dropping waters, is signified that genuine truths are from the sense of the letter of the Word; by the skies uttering a voice is signified influx from the heavens; by thy darts also went forth, are signified Divine Truths therefrom.<p>So in Job:<p>God "bindeth up the waters in his clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. He spreadeth his cloud upon" his throne (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_26_8.htm">26:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_26_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Here, also, clouds denote ultimate truths in order, and because these contain in themselves and include spiritual truths, so that they may not be dissipated, this is expressed and signified by God binding up the waters in His clouds, and by the cloud not being rent. Because exterior truths which are called natural, also encompass and enclose interior truths, which are called spiritual, and are proper to the angels of the heavens, this fact is expressed and signified by, "He spreadeth his cloud upon his throne."</p><p>[15] And in Isaiah:<p>"Jehovah said, I will take my rest, and I will behold in my dwelling-place as a clear heat upon light, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_18_4.htm">18:4</a>).<p>A cloud of dew signifies truth fructifying from good.<p>Again, in the same prophet:<p>"Jehovah will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon all her assemblies, a cloud by day, and the smoke and shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">4:5</a>).<p>Here the dwelling-place of Mount Zion signifies the good of the celestial church, and her assemblies signify the truths of that good; its defence, lest it should be injured from too much light or from too much shade, is signified by the cloud by day, and the smoke and shining of a flaming fire by night. And since all spiritual good and truth are preserved by natural good and truth from being injured, it is therefore said that upon all the glory shall be a covering, glory denoting spiritual good and truth.</p><p>[16] The same is signified by, "The cloud upon the tabernacle by day and the fire by night" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_9_15.htm">Num. 9:15-17</a> to end; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_11.htm">10:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_14.htm">14:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_1_33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>). Also by Jehovah going before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_13_21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), and by the pillar of a cloud that stood between the camp of the sons of Israel and the camp of the Egyptians (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_19.htm">Exodus 14:19-21</a>).<p>And in David:<p>God led them in a cloud by day, and all the night in the light of fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_14.htm">Psalm 78:14</a>).<p>And again:<p>"Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them fell upon them. He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give them light in the night" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_38.htm">Psalm 105:38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_39.htm">39</a>).<p>The reason why a cloud was upon the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, was, that the tabernacle represented heaven and the church, the cloud, the presence of the Lord by means of Divine Truth, and the fire, His presence by means of Divine Good, which is called the good of faith, each ultimate in order, therefore they were as coverings for the tabernacle; on this account it is said in the passages adduced above from David and Isaiah: "Over all the glory shall be a covering and, "be spread a cloud for a covering."<p>The same is signified by the cloud which covered Mount Horeb, and into which Moses entered; also by the cloud in which Jehovah descended on Mount Sinai, and by the pillar of a cloud which stood at the door of the tent of Moses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_15.htm">Exodus 24:15-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_16.htm">19:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_34_5.htm">34:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_9.htm">33:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_10.htm">10</a>).</p><p>[17] This is also the signification of the cloud in the following passages in Ezekiel:<p>"I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_4.htm">1:4</a>).<p>And again:<p>"The cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. Then the glory of Jehovah went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_3.htm">10:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_4.htm">4</a>).<p>The cherubim here signify the Lord's care, that he may not be approached except through the good of love; hence cherubim signify the heavens, particularly, the inmost or third heaven, because the angels of that heaven receive Divine Truth in the good of love, therefore it is Divine Truth that defends, which, in its essence, is the good of love. This Divine Truth, as it descends out of the inmost heaven into the lower heavens, and at length into the world where men are, from being pure becomes gradually denser. This is the reason why it appears in the lowest degree like a cloud, which signifies the Divine Truth accommodated to the apprehension of the angels in the lowest heaven, who are spiritual-natural, and, lastly, to the apprehension of men in the natural world. And because the Divine Truth in this degree is similar to the Divine Truth as it is in the sense of the letter of the Word, therefore a cloud signifies the Word as to the sense of the letter. This Divine Truth is that which filled the court like a cloud, and lastly the house, at the right side of which the cherubim stood. And because this Divine Truth is interiorly spiritual, and shines from celestial light, therefore it is called glory, and it is said that the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of Jehovah. Hence also it is said in Job:<p>"When" "God causeth the light of his cloud to shine?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_36_15.htm">Job 36:15</a>).</p><p>[18] Since the higher heavens appear to the eyes of those who are in the lower heavens as though covered over with a thin bright cloud, because the lower angels cannot behold the higher or interior Divine except according to their quality, therefore also the Divine Truth in the higher heavens, or what is the same thing, the higher heavens themselves, are in some passages of the Word meant by clouds. For whether we say Divine Truth, or the heavens, it is the same thing, since the heavens are heavens from the Divine Truth, and the angels there are angels from the reception of it. In this sense clouds are mentioned in Isaiah:<p>Lucifer, "thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud; I will become like the Most High" (<a href="../ae/7.htm">7</a>, <a href="../ae/483.htm">483</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>).</p><p>[19] Since there are clouds of a thinner and brighter quality, and also of a denser and darker kind, and because the thinner and brighter appear beneath the heavens, but the denser and darker about many of the hells, it is therefore evident that, in the opposite sense, clouds also signify the falsities of evil, which are contrary to truths from good; as in the following passages.<p>Thus in Ezekiel:<p>As for Egypt, "a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1861.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1861</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8814.htm">8814</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8819.htm">8819</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9434.htm">9434</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10551.htm">10551</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 594</h4><p>594. Encompassed with a cloud, signifies the ultimate of the Word. This is evident from the signification of "encompassed," as being by what is outside of one, for that which is round about is also without, for it is more remote in the circumference; so here it means the ultimate. Also from the signification of a "cloud," as being Divine truth in ultimates, consequently the Word in the sense of the letter. This signification of "cloud" is evident from appearances in the spiritual world; also from the Word wherever "clouds" are mentioned. From appearances in the spiritual world, as follows: the universal angelic heaven consists solely of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; the reception of this constitutes angels. In the highest heaven this truth appears like a pure aura which is called ether; in the next lower heaven as less pure, almost like the atmosphere that is called air; in the lowest heaven it appears like something thinly aqueous over which is a vapor like a cloud; such is the appearance of Divine truth according to degrees in its descent. There is a like appearance when angels of the higher heavens speak about Divine truths; what they say is then presented to the view of those who are in the lowest heaven under the appearance of a cloud that floats hither and thither; the more intelligent of them know from its movement and brightness and form what the angels of the higher heavens are speaking about with each other. This makes evident why a "cloud" signifies Divine truth in ultimates. As most things in the Word were taken from the appearances in the spiritual world, and thence have a like significance as they have there, so is it with "clouds."</p><p>[2] That a "cloud" signifies in the Word the sense of the letter, which is Divine truth in ultimates, can be seen from the following passages. In the Gospels:<p>Jesus took Peter, James, and John into a high mountain; and He was transfigured before them; and His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became as the light. And behold, there appeared Moses and Elijah speaking with Him. While Peter was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him (<a href="../njhd/303.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 303-306</a>; and that the Lord is the Word, n. <a href="../njhd/263.htm">263</a>.) Consequently the particular things that were seen when He was transfigured signify the proceeding of Divine truth from the Lord's Divine good. The Divine good of Divine love which was in Him, and from which He had Divine truth in His Human, was represented by "His face did shine as the sun;" for the "face" represents the interiors, since these shine forth through the face; and the "sun" signifies the Divine love (See above, n. <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>, <a href="../ae/412.htm">412</a>). The Divine truth was represented by the "garments" which became as the light; "garments" in the Word signify truths, and "the Lord's garments" Divine truth (See also above, n. <a href="../ae/64.htm">64</a>, <a href="../ae/271.htm">271</a>, <a href="../ae/395.htm">395</a>); this is why they appeared "as the light;" for Divine truth makes the light in the angelic heaven, and is therefore signified by "light" in the Word (respecting which see in the work on <a href="../hh/126.htm">Heaven and Hell 126-140</a>). Because it was the Word, which is Divine truth, that was represented, therefore "there appeared Moses and Elijah speaking with Him;" "Moses and Elijah" signifying the Word; "Moses" the historical Word, and "Elijah" the prophetical Word. The Word in the letter was represented by the "cloud that overshadowed the disciples, and into which they entered;" for the "disciples" represented in the Word the church, which at that time and afterwards was only in truths from the sense of the letter; and because, as has been said in the article above, revelations and responses are made by Divine truth in ultimates, and because this truth is such as is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, it came to pass that "a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him," meaning that He is Divine truth, or the Word.</p><p>[3] He who does not know that a "cloud" in the spiritual sense of the Word means the Word in the letter, cannot know what arcanum is involved in this:<p>That in the consummation of the age they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory (<a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a>), also the revelation itself of the spiritual sense (in the small work on The White Horse); "Son of man" also signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth (as may be seen above, n. <a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>, <a href="../ae/151.htm">151</a>).</p><p>[4] That a "cloud" signifies Divine truth in ultimates, consequently the Word in the sense of the letter, can be seen further from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, and cometh into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt are moved before Him, and the heart of the Egyptian melteth in the midst of him (19 <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>"Egypt" here does not mean Egypt, but the natural man when separated from the spiritual, which is then in falsities and evils, and through these perverts all the truths and goods of the church; that the natural man is destroyed by these falsities and evils when truth from good flows in from the Lord is described by these words of the prophet understood in the internal sense. Jehovah is said "to ride upon a light cloud" to signify that the Lord enlightens the understanding with truths; "to ride" in reference to Jehovah or the Lord, signifying to enlighten the understanding, and "a light cloud" signifying truth; that then "the idols of Egypt are moved, and the heart of the Egyptian melteth," signifies that the evils and falsities of the natural man, separated from the spiritual, then destroy the natural man; "idols" meaning falsities, the "heart" evils, and "Egypt" the natural man.</p><p>[5] In Moses:<p>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth in heaven and in His magnificence upon the clouds, the abode of the God of antiquity, and underneath are the arms of the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_27.htm">27</a>).<p>Here, too, "riding in heaven upon the clouds" signifies to enlighten the understanding by the influx of spiritual truth into natural truth, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word. Because Divine truth in the heavens is spiritual, and Divine truth on the earth is natural, and the latter is enlightened by the former, therefore it is said, "and in His magnificence upon the clouds;" "the abode of the God of antiquity" means Divine truth with the angels, and "the arms of the world," mean Divine truths with men; the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are what are meant by "the arms of the world," for that sense is the very strength of Divine truth, "arms" signifying strength. (That the strength of Divine truth is in the sense of the letter can be seen in the article just above.)</p><p>[6] In David:<p>God rode upon a cherub and did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness His hiding place; His tent round about Him the darkness of waters, the clouds of the heavens. At the brightness before Him the clouds passed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-12</a>).<p>This, too, describes the enlightenment of the Word, and thus of the church; enlightenment by the influx of Divine truth from the heavens is signified by "God rode upon a cherub and did fly;" Divine truth in ultimates which is enlightened is signified by "the wings of the wind," "the darkness of waters," and "the clouds of the heavens," these signifying the various degrees of the understanding receiving enlightenment; that the obscurities of the ultimate sense are thereby dissipated is meant by "at the brightness before Him the clouds passed."</p><p>[7] In the same:<p>Sing unto God, praise His name; extol Him that rideth upon the clouds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>).<p>Here, too, "Him that rideth upon the clouds" means the Lord as to enlightenment; "clouds" meaning truths in ultimates, which are enlightened, and these are enlightened by the influx of light, which is Divine truth, from the spiritual world or heaven.</p><p>[8] In Nahum:<p>Jehovah hath His way in the storm and in the tempest, and the clouds are the dust of His feet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/nahum_1_3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p>Truth in ultimates, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, is called "clouds, the dust of the feet of Jehovah," because it is the natural and lowest truth, into which Divine truth in heaven, which is spiritual, closes, and upon which it subsists. Divine truth in ultimates, because it is but little understood unless there is enlightenment from heaven, is a subject of discussion and controversy, and this is meant by "storm and tempest in which Jehovah hath His way," spiritual "storm and tempest" meaning discussion concerning the genuine sense, which nevertheless, with those who desire truth, the Lord enlightens by means of influx.</p><p>[9] In David:<p>His seed shall be to eternity, and His throne as the sun before Thee. <sup>1</sup>It shall be established as the moon to eternity, and as a faithful witness in the clouds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_36.htm">Psalms 89:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_37.htm">37</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord, and the "seed that shall be to eternity" signifies Divine truth which is from Him. The "throne that shall be as the sun and as the moon" signifies heaven and the church as to the good of love and as to the truth of faith; "throne" signifying heaven and the church; "as the sun" in respect to the good of love, and "as the moon" in respect to the truth of faith. "A faithful witness in the clouds" signifies that He is Divine truth, for "witness" in reference to the Lord, signifies that which proceeds from Him, and as that is His, it witnesses respecting Him.</p><p>[10] In the same:<p>Jehovah layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters; He maketh the cloud <sup>2</sup>His chariot; He walketh upon the wings of the wind (<a href="../ae/71.htm">71</a>, <a href="../ae/483.htm">483</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>, <a href="../ae/537.htm">537</a>, <a href="../ae/538.htm">538</a>.)</p><p>[11] In Isaiah:<p>I will lay waste My vineyard, I will even command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>).<p>This means that the church shall have no understanding of Divine truth or of the Word; "vineyard" signifying the church, "clouds" the Word in the letter, and "their raining no rain," that there shall be no understanding of Divine truth from the Word.</p><p>[12] In David:<p>Jehovah who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_147_8.htm">Psalms 147:8</a>).<p>"To cover the heavens with clouds" signifies to defend and preserve the spiritual things of the Word which are in the heavens, by means of natural truths such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; "who prepareth rain for the earth" signifies instruction therefrom for the church; "who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains" signifies nourishment thereby for those who are in the good of love.</p><p>[13] The like is signified by the following words in Isaiah:<p>Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds stream down with righteousness; let the earth open and bring forth the fruit of salvation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>).<p>And in Judges:<p>Jehovah, when Thou didst go forth out of Seir, when Thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yea, the clouds dropped waters (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_5_4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>).<p>"To go forth out of Seir, and to march out of the field of Edom," signifies, in reference to Jehovah, the enlightenment of the Gentiles by the Lord when He assumed the Human; "the earth trembling" signifies the state of the church then changed; "the heavens dropped, and the clouds dropped waters," signifies instruction, influx, and perception of Divine truth; "to drop" signifying instruction and influx; "waters" truths; "the heavens" the interior things of truth, and "clouds," the exterior, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word.</p><p>[14] In David:<p>The clouds poured out waters; the skies gave forth a voice, and Thine arrows went forth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_17.htm">Psalms 77:17</a>).<p>"The clouds poured out waters" signifies that there are genuine truths from the sense of the letter of the Word; "the skies gave forth a voice" signifies influx from the heavens; "Thine arrows went forth" signifies Divine truths therefrom. In Job:<p>God bindeth up the waters in His clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them. He spreadeth His cloud upon His throne (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_26_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Here, too, "clouds" stand for truths ultimate in order, and because these contain in themselves and enclose spiritual truths that they may not be dispersed, this is described and signified by "God bindeth up the waters in His clouds, and the cloud is not rent;" because exterior truths, which are called natural, also encompass and enclose interior truths, which are called spiritual, and are proper to the angels of the heavens, this is described and signified by "He spreadeth His cloud upon His throne."</p><p>[15] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah said, I will be quiet, and I will behold in My dwelling place like clear heat upon light, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_18_4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>);<p>a "cloud of dew" signifying truth bringing forth fruit from good. In the same:<p>Jehovah will create over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon her convocations a cloud by day, and a smoke and the brightness of a flame of fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>).<p>"The dwelling place of Mount Zion" signifies the good of the celestial church, and "her convocations" signify the truths of that good; protection lest it should be hurt by too much light or too much shade is signified by "a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night," and as every spiritual good and truth is preserved from harm by natural good and truth, it is said that "upon all the glory shall be a covering," "glory" meaning spiritual good and truth.</p><p>[16] The same is signified by:<p>The cloud that was upon the tabernacle by day, and the fire by night (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_40_36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_9_15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>to the end;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_10_34.htm">34</a>;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_14.htm">14:14</a>;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_1_33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>).<p>Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_13_21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>).<p>The pillar of the cloud stood between the camp of the sons of Israel and the camp of the Egyptians (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_19.htm">Exodus 14:19-21</a>).<p>In David:<p>God led them in the daytime in a cloud, and all the night in the light of fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_14.htm">Psalms 78:14</a>).<p>And elsewhere in the same:<p>Egypt was glad when they went forth, for the dread of them had fallen upon them. He spread out a cloud for a covering, and fire to make light the night (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_38.htm">Psalms 105:38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_105_39.htm">39</a>).<p>"There was a cloud upon the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night," because the "tabernacle" represented heaven and the church, the "cloud" the Lord's presence through Divine truth, and the "fire" His presence through Divine good, which is called the good of faith, each ultimate in order; therefore they were as coverings over the tabernacle; for this reason it is said in the passages cited above from Isaiah and David, "over all the glory shall be a covering," and "He spread out a cloud for a covering."<p>The like is signified by:<p>The cloud that covered Mount Horeb, into which cloud Moses entered (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_24_15.htm">Exodus 24:15-18</a>).<p>And the like by:<p>The cloud in which Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_19_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_34_5.htm">34:5</a>).<p>And the like by:<p>The pillar of cloud that stood at the door of Moses' tent (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_33_10.htm">10</a>).</p><p>[17] So again of the "cloud" in Ezekiel:<p>I looked, and behold a wind of a tempest came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself in itself, and a brightness round about it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>).<p>And in the same:<p>The cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man entered in; and the cloud filled the inner court; and the glory of Jehovah mounted up from above the cherub upon the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_4.htm">4</a>).<p>The "cherubim" signify the Lord in respect to guarding, that there be no approach except through the good of love; so, too, the "cherubim" signify the heavens, in particular the inmost or third heaven, because the angels who are there receive Divine truth in the good of love, therefore it is Divine truth, which is in its essence the good of love, that guards. This Divine truth, as it comes down out of the inmost heaven into the lower heavens, and at length into the world where men are, from being pure becomes thus by degrees more dense, consequently in the lowest degree it appears like a cloud; this is why it signifies Divine truth accommodated to the apprehension of the angels who are in the lowest heaven, who are spiritual-natural, and finally to the apprehension of men in the natural world. Moreover, as Divine truth in this degree is similar to the Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word, "cloud" signifies the Word as to the sense of the letter. It was this Divine truth that filled the court like a cloud, and at length the house, at the right side of which stood the cherubim; and as this Divine truth is inwardly the spiritual that shines from heavenly light, therefore it is called "glory," and it is said that "the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory." Also in Job:<p>When God maketh the light of His cloud to be bright (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/job_37_15.htm">Job 37:15</a>).</p><p>[18] Because the higher heavens appear before the eyes of those who are in the lower heavens as covered by a light and bright cloud (for the reason that the lower angels are unable to see the higher or interior Divine otherwise than in accordance with their own quality), therefore also Divine truth in the higher heavens, or what is the same thing, the higher heavens themselves, are meant in some passages in the Word by "clouds;" for whether you say Divine truth or the heavens it is the same, since the heavens are heavens from Divine truth, and the angels there are angels from the reception of Divine truth. It is in this sense that "clouds" are mentioned in Isaiah:<p>Lucifer, thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud; I will become like the Most High (<a href="../ae/71.htm">71</a>, <a href="../ae/483.htm">483</a>, <a href="../ae/518.htm">518</a>).</p><p>[19] As there are clouds that are lighter and brighter, also clouds that are denser and blacker, and lighter and brighter clouds appear beneath the heavens, but dense and black clouds are seen about many of the hells, it is evident that "clouds" in the contrary sense signify the falsities of evil which are contrary to truths from good, as in the following passages. In Ezekiel:<p>Egypt a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1861.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1861</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8814.htm">8814</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8819.htm">8819</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9434.htm">9434</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10551.htm">10551</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Latin has "Thee," the Hebrew "Me," as found also in <a href="../ae/205.htm">AE 205</a>, <a href="../ae/401.htm">401</a>, <a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>, <a href="../ae/768.htm">768</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Latin has "cloud," the Hebrew "clouds," as found in <a href="../ae/26.htm">AE 26</a>, <a href="../ae/283.htm">283</a>, <a href="../ae/319.htm">319</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 594 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>594. "Circumdatum nube." - Quod significet ultimum Verbi, constat ex significatione "circumdari", quod sit ab extra illum esse; nam quod circum est hoc quoque est extra, est enim ulterius in circumferentia, hic itaque ultimum: et ex significatione "nubis", quod sit Divinum Verum in ultimis, proinde Verbum in sensu litterae: quod "nubes" id significet, patet ex apparentiis in mundo spirituali, tum ex Verbo ubi "nubes" dicitur. Ex apparentiis in mundo spirituali: - Universum caelum angelicum unice consistit ex Divino Vero quod procedit a Domino; receptio ejus facit angelos. Illud in supremo caelo apparet sicut aura pura quae vocatur aether; in inferiori caelo sicut minus pura, paene sicut atmosphaera quae vocatur aer; in infimo caelo apparet illud sicut tenue aqueum, super quo vapor sicut nubes: talis apparentia est Divini Veri secundum gradus in descensu. Simile apparet quando angeli superiorum caelorum loquuntur de Divinis veris; tunc loquela illorum, apud illos qui in infimo caelo sunt, sistitur sub aspectu nubis, quae huc illuc volat; angeli intelligentiores ibi norunt ex lapsu, candore et forma, quid inter se angeli superiorum caelorum loquuntur; inde constare potest, unde est quod "nubes" significet Divinum Verum in ultimis. Quoniam pleraque in Verbo ex apparentiis in mundo spirituali desumpta sunt, et inde similia quae ibi significant, ideo etiam "nubes."<p>[2] Quod "nubes" in Verbo significet sensum litterae, qui est Divinum Verum in ultimis, constare potest ex sequentibus:<p>- Apud Evangelistas,<p>"Jesus assumpsit Petrum, Jacobum et Johannem.... in montem altum.., et transformatus coram iis, splenduit facies Ipsius sicut sol, vestimenta Ipsius facta sicut lux; et ecce visi sunt Moses et Elias cum Ipso loquentes." ....

Hoc Divinum Verum est quod sicut nubes implebat atrium, et denique domum, a cujus dextra steterunt cherubi: et quia hoc Divinum Verum interius est spirituale, quod splendet a luce caelesti, ideo vocatur "gloria", et dicitur quod "atrium plenum esset splendore gloriae Jehovae." Et apud Hiobum,<p>"cum" Deus "splendere facit lucem nubis suae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_594/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_37_15" target=_top>37:15</a>).</p><p>[18] Quoniam caeli superiores apparent coram oculis eorum qui in caelis inferioribus sunt sicut circumtecti tenui et candida nube, (ex causa quia angeli inferiores non aliter Divinum superius seu interius spectare possunt quam secundum quale eorum, ) ideo etiam Divinum Verum in caelis superioribus aliquibus in locis in Verbo intelligitur per "nubes"; seu quod idem, quod caeli superiores per "nubem" intelligantur: sive enim dicas Divinum Verum sive dicas caelos, idem est; nam caeli sunt caeli ex Divino Vero, et angeli ibi sunt angeli ex receptione ejus.
