<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 706</h4><p>706. And a great sign was seen in heaven.- That this signifies Divine testification concerning the future church, and the reception of its doctrine, and as to those by whom it will be assaulted, is evident from the signification of a great sign in heaven, as denoting Divine manifestation and testification. That this refers to the church, and the reception of its doctrine, and also assault upon it, is evident from what follows, for the woman means the church, her male child, doctrine, while the dragon and his angels, and afterwards the beasts, mean those who will assault the church and its doctrine. This vision is called a great sign, because a sign means Divine manifestation concerning things to come, also testification, here concerning the future church and its doctrine, and also concerning assault upon it by those who are meant by the dragon and the beasts. This is called a sign, because it manifests and testifies. The terms sign and miracle are frequently used in the Word, sign meaning that which points out, witnesses, and persuades in regard to the subject of inquiry; but miracle means that which arouses, strikes dumb and fills with amazement. Thus a sign moves the understanding and faith, and a miracle the will and its affection; for the will with its affection is what is aroused, stricken dumb and filled with amazement, while it is understanding and its faith that are persuaded by signs and testifications.</p><p>[2] That there is a difference between a sign and a miracle is evident from this fact, that although the Jews saw so many miracles performed by the Lord still they asked signs of Him; and also from this fact, that the prodigies wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness are sometimes called signs, sometimes miracles, and sometimes also both. And it is further evident from this, that in every part of the Word there is a marriage of truth and good, thus also of the understanding and will, for truth pertains to the understanding and good to the will, consequently signs there have reference to things pertaining to truth, thus to those of faith and the understanding, and miracles to things pertaining to good, thus to those of affection and the will. What is the specific meaning of signs and miracles, when both are mentioned in the Word, is now plain, as in the following passages.<p>In Moses:<p>"I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, that I may multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt" (<a href="../ae/624.htm">624:5</a>, <a href="../ae/684.htm">684:7</a>).</p><p>[3] In Moses:<p>"If there shall arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, who shall give thee a sign or a miracle, and the sign or miracle come to pass which he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go unto other gods, thou shalt not obey" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>).<p>Here a prophet, and a dreamer of dreams, also a sign and miracle are mentioned, because a sign refers to a prophet, and a miracle to a dreamer of dreams; for a prophet means one who teaches truths, and, in the abstract sense, the doctrine of truth, and a dreamer [of dreams] means one who stirs up (another) to do a thing, and, in the abstract sense, the act of stirring up, from which a thing is done; this also pertains to a miracle as the former does to a sign. For prophets were instructed by a living voice from the Lord, and dreamers by representatives arousing to action, which flowed into the affection of the dreamer, and from that into the sight of the thought; for when a man dreams, his natural understanding is laid asleep, and his spiritual sight which derives its all from the affection is opened. But in this passage, the sight which derives its all from an evil affection is meant, for it is spoken of the prophets who teach falsities and who dream vain things, for by other gods are meant the falsities and vain things that such heard and saw.</p><p>[4] That signs signify testifications, which point out and persuade to the belief that a thing is so, is evident from the following passages.<p>In Moses:<p>"If they will not believe thee, nor hear the voice of the first sign, yet they will believe the voice of the latter sign; and if they will not believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice, thou shalt take of the waters of the river, and they shall become blood" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_8.htm">Exodus 4:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_9.htm">9</a>).<p>This is said of the miracles wrought by Moses, when the Lord appeared to him in the bush, which are called signs, because they were to testify and persuade them to believe that Moses was sent to lead them out of Egypt. It is therefore three times said "that they may believe," and also "that they may hear his voice."</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>"Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people not believe in me, for all the signs which I have done in the midst of them; none of the men who have seen my glory, and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, shall see the land" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_22.htm">22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_23.htm">23</a>).<p>Similarly here likewise miracles are called signs, because mention is made of believing; for, as has been said, miracles are called signs because they persuade and induce faith; and as signs did not induce faith, with those who, by reason of fear, were not willing to enter into the land of Canaan, therefore it is said concerning them that they should not see the land. Similar things are signified by signs in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_14_17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_2.htm">2</a>.</p><p>[6] In the Evangelists:<p>The Scribes and Pharisees said, "Master, we desire to see from thee a sign; and he answering, said, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign, but no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; as Jonah was in the belly of the whale (cetus) three days and three nights, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_38.htm">Matthew 12:38-40</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_30.htm">30</a>).<p>That a sign here means testification that they would be persuaded and believe that the Lord was the Messiah and the Son of God who was to come, is plain; for the miracles which the Lord wrought in great numbers, and which they saw, were no signs to them, because miracles, as said above, are signs only to the good. Jonah was in the belly of the whale (cetus) three days and three nights, and this was taken for a sign, because it signified the burial and resurrection of the Lord, thus the complete glorification of His Human, three days and three nights signifying completeness.</p><p>[7] In Matthew:<p>The Pharisees and the Sadducees, tempting, asked Jesus "to show them a sign from the heavens. He answering, said, When it is evening, ye say, it will be fair weather, for the heaven is red; and in the morning, it will be tempestuous to-day, for the heaven is red and gloomy. Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of the heaven, but ye cannot the signs of the times. An evil and adulterous nation requireth a sign, but no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_1.htm">16:1-4</a>).<p>The sign which they asked from heaven here also means testification, that they would be persuaded and believe that the Lord was the Son of God, although miracles were performed, which they did not call signs. The Lord at that time spoke of evening and morning, because "evening and morning" signifies the Lord's coming; here it means, when the church with the Jews was devastated, for then they had "fair weather," because they knew not the Lord, and lived securely in falsities from evil; this is the evening. But when they knew Him, and, because of falsities from evils in which they were, denied and assaulted Him, then this state is signified by the morning when it is tempestuous. This is why the Lord said, "Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of the heaven, but the signs of the times ye cannot," that is, the Lord's coming; because they were an evil and adulterous nation, that is, one that adulterated the Word, therefore He said that a sign should not be given them.</p><p>[8] So again in Mark:<p>"The Pharisees began to dispute with 'Jesus,' seeking of him a sign from heaven; and he, sighing in his spirit, said, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily, I say unto you, A sign shall not be given unto this generation" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_11.htm">8:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_12.htm">12</a>).<p>That here a sign signifies testification, from which they might plainly know, acknowledge, and believe that the Lord was the Messiah and the Son of God whom they expected through the predictions in the prophets, is evident from the fact that Jesus sighed in spirit, and said, "Why doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily, I say unto you, A sign shall not be given unto this generation." The reason of this was, that if it had been plainly revealed or told them from heaven, and if so persuaded they had acknowledged and believed, nevertheless they would have afterwards rejected it, and to reject after acknowledgment and faith is to profane, and the lot of profaners in hell is the worst of all.</p><p>[9] That for this reason plain testification was not given them from heaven, is clear from these words in John:<p>"He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and should turn themselves, and I should heal them" (<a href="../njhd/172.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 172</a>).</p><p>[10] In John:<p>The disciples said unto Jesus, "What sign doest thou, that we may see and believe thee? what workest thou? Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven; for the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven and giveth life to the world" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_30.htm">6:30-33</a>).<p>Here also the disciples desired a sign; that this signifies testification that they might believe, is clear from their saying, "That we may see and believe, what workest thou?" They then spoke of manna, and the Lord answered concerning bread from heaven, because bread signifies all the good and truth that nourishes the soul, and, in the highest sense, the Lord Himself, from whom are everything of doctrine and everything of spiritual nourishment, by means of which He testified that they might see and believe. Nevertheless testification, which is a sign from heaven, was given to the three disciples, Peter, James, and John, as is evident from the transfiguration of the Lord, for then they saw His glory, and also heard a voice out of heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>).</p><p>[11] In John:<p>When Jesus cast out of the temple them that sold therein, the Jews said, "What sign showest thou, that thou doest these things? Jesus answered, and said to them, destroy this temple, yet in three days I will raise it up" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_16.htm">2:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_19.htm">19</a>).<p>That here to show a sign signifies to testify by something wonderful, or by a voice from heaven, is plain. But because such testification would have condemned rather than saved them, as has been said just above, therefore He answered them concerning the temple - by which He meant His body - that this should be dissolved (solveretur), that is, should die, and rise again glorified on the third day. This also is what the Lord meant by the sign of Jonah in the belly of the whale (cetus) three days and three nights. That the temple in the highest sense signifies the Lord's body, may be seen in John (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_21.htm">2:21</a>).</p><p>[12] In Luke:<p>"The angel said to the shepherds, There is born to you this day, in the city of David, a Saviour who is Christ the Lord; and this is the sign unto you, ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_11.htm">2:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Since a sign meant testification that they might believe that the Saviour of the world was born, it is therefore said that they should find Him lying in a manger, wrapped in swaddling clothes; but that this was a testification no one can know until it is known what is meant by a manger, and by swaddling clothes. A manger means doctrine of truth from the Word, because horses signify the understanding of the Word, as is evident from what has been shown above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_11.htm">22:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_14.htm">Mark 14:14</a>; and elsewhere. And this was the case with the Jews, who were then in mere falsities, through adulteration of the Word. This therefore is what is signified by there being no place in the inn. For if it had pleased the Lord, He might have been born in the most splendid palace, and been laid in a bed adorned with precious stones, but this would have been among such as were in no doctrine of truth, and there would have been no heavenly representation. He is also said to have been wrapped in swaddling clothes, because swaddling clothes signify primary truths, which are truths of innocence, and also truths of Divine Love; for nakedness when said in reference to a babe, signifies the deprivation of truth. From this it is evident why it was said by the angels, "This is the sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."</p><p>[13] In the Evangelists: the disciples said to Jesus,<p>"What shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the age?" (<a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a>); further explanation is therefore unnecessary.</p><p>[14] In Mark: Jesus said unto the disciples,<p>"These signs shall follow them that believe: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be restored. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them by signs following" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_17.htm">16:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_20.htm">20</a>).<p>Although these were miracles, yet they are called signs, because they testified of the Divine power of the Lord who performed them; therefore it is said, the Lord working with them by these signs. If these had been performed by the evil they would have been called miracles, for with them such things cause only amazement, and make an impression on the mind, and yet produce no conviction; but it is otherwise, with the good, for with them, these same things are testifications which induce belief, they are therefore also called signs, and it is said "these signs shall follow them that believe." But how these signs could produce conviction, shall also be briefly stated. Those miraculous signs - that they should cast out demons, speak with new tongues, take up serpents, that if they drank any deadly thing it should not hurt them, and that the sick should be restored by the laying on of hands - were spiritual in their essence and origin, from which these flowed forth and came forth as effects; for they were correspondences, which derive their all from the spiritual world by influx from the Lord. For example, that they should cast out demons in the name of the Lord, derived its effect from this circumstance, that the name of the Lord spiritually understood means everything of doctrine out of the Word from the Lord, and that demons are falsities of every kind; and these are thus cast out, that is, removed by means of doctrine out of the Word from the Lord. That they should speak with new tongues, derived its effect from this, that new tongues signify doctrinals for the new church; they should take up serpents because serpents signify the hells as to wickedness (malitia), and thus they would be safe from its infestation. They should not be hurt if they drank a deadly thing, denotes that the wickedness (malitia) of the hells should not infect them. That the sick should be restored by the laying on of hands means through communication and conjunction with heaven, thus with the Lord, to be restored to health from spiritual diseases, which are called iniquities and sins; the laying on of the disciples' hands, corresponding to communication and conjunction with the Lord, thus to the removal of iniquities by His Divine power.</p><p>[15] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah said unto Ahaz, "Ask thee a sign of Jehovah; direct [it] into the deep, or lift [it] up above; the Lord giveth you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son, and shall call his name God with us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_11.htm">7:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">14</a>).<p>These things were said to Ahaz, king of Judah, because the king of Syria and the king of Israel made war against him, even unto Jerusalem, on whose side also was the tribe of Ephraim; but still they did not prevail, for the reason that the king of Syria here represented the External or Natural of the church, the king of Israel its Internal or Spiritual, and Ephraim the Intellectual; here, however, those three, namely, the Natural, the Spiritual, and the Intellectual perverted, and these wished to attack the doctrine of truth, signified by the king of Judah and by Jerusalem, therefore they did not succeed. But in order that Ahaz might be assured that their attempt would be vain, he was told to ask a sign, that is, a testification that he might be assured, and the choice was given him, whether it should be from heaven or from hell; this was signified by "direct [it] into the deep, or lift [it] up above"; for the king was evil. But because Jerusalem, which signifies the doctrine of truth from the Word, was not to be destroyed by such before the Lord's coming, therefore a miraculous sign was given to him testifying concerning that subject, namely, that "a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son, whose name shall be God with us." That this church would subsequently be destroyed, is shown further on in that chapter.</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>"This shall be a sign to thee from with Jehovah, behold, I will bring back the shadow of the steps <sup>1</sup>which is gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun, ten steps backward, that the sun may return ten steps on the steps which it has gone down" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_7.htm">38:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_8.htm">8</a>).<p>This sign was given to king Hezekiah as a testification that the Lord would defend him and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria - as said in verse 6 of that chapter, - that king signifying the perverted Rational destroying all things of the church; therefore this sign similarly represented a new church, to be established by the Lord, but here, that the time would be extended beyond that which was told to Ahaz just above. Bringing back the shadow that had gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun, signifies holding back the time when it should take place, the steps of Ahaz signifying time, here until the Lord's coming, and the shadow signifying the progression of time from the rising to the setting. Its being brought back ten steps signifies the extension of the time as yet for several years, ten signifying several, and the sun which should go back signifying the Lord's coming. But this shall be further illustrated. The Lord's coming took place when the Jewish church was at an end, that is, when there was no good and truth left in it. This is meant by the words, when iniquity was consummated, and also by the fulness of times, in which the Lord was to come. The entire period of the duration of the Jewish church was represented by the steps of Ahaz, its beginning by the first step there, which is when the sun is in its rising, and its end by the last step in its setting. It is therefore plain that by the bringing back of the shadow from the setting towards the rising, means the extension of that time. This would take place on the steps of Ahaz, because Ahaz was a wicked king, and profaned the holy things of the church, therefore, if his successors had acted in a similar manner, the end of that church would have come quickly, but as Hezekiah was an upright king the time was extended; for on that account the iniquity of that nation was not so soon to arrive at its consummation, that is, its end.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>Say ye unto the king Hezekiah, "This shall be a sign to thee, in this year ye shall eat that which springeth up of itself, and in the second year that which further groweth; but in the third year sow ye, reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>).<p>This was said to king Hezekiah, when Sennacherib, king of Assyria, made war against him, and spoke proudly of himself, and insolently of God and of Israel; and in consequence one hundred and eighty-five thousand were smitten in his camp, and he himself was slain by his sons. This was done, because Assyria signifies the Rational, and the king of Assyria the same, while Judea signifies the Celestial of the church, and its king the Spiritual; but here the king of Assyria signifies the perverted Rational, which destroys by false reasonings all the celestial and spiritual things of the church, which are its goods and truths. And because by Judea and its king are signified the Celestial and Spiritual of the church which will be from the Lord when He comes into the world, therefore these things are said, which describe the regeneration of those who will be of that church. Consequently the sign, that they should eat in the first year that which springeth up of itself, signifies the celestial good which the Lord will implant in them; that which further groweth in the second year, signifies the truth of that good which shall come from it. To sow, to reap, to plant vineyards, and to eat the fruit of them, signify all the goods and truths which flow forth therefrom; to sow and reap, signifies the implantation of good and its reception; to plant vineyards, the implantation of truth and its reception. To eat the fruit of them, signifies the enjoyment which the regenerate man has of goods and of the things therefrom that give satisfaction. These things are called a sign, because they are testifications concerning the celestial church with those who are meant in the spiritual sense by Judah, whose regeneration is effected from the Lord by means of the implantation of celestial good, afterwards by means of the implantation of spiritual good, which in its essence is the truth of celestial good, and, lastly, by multiplication and fructification in the natural man.</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>"Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Former; they asked of me signs concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands they command me; I have raised him up in justice, and I will make straight all his ways. He shall build my city and let go my captivity, not for price, or for reward" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_13.htm">13</a>).<p>This also treats of the Lord's coming, and of the establishment of a church by Him. The Lord is meant by Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and His Former. He is called the Holy One of Israel from Divine Truth, and His Former from the establishment of a church by its means, and Israel denotes the church; therefore His sons, concerning whom they asked signs, mean those who are in truths from the Lord, while the work of His hands means their formation and the establishment of the church among them. I have raised Him up in justice, and all His ways will I make straight, signifies that Divine Good and Divine Truth are His; for justice, in the Word, is used in reference to good, and ways signify truths, leading, in this case, Divine truths, because they are spoken of the Lord. He shall build my city, and let go my captivity, signifies that He will restore the doctrine of truth, and liberate those who are in falsities from ignorance, a city signifying the doctrine of truth, and captivity the falsities of ignorance in which the nations were, and through which they were in spiritual captivity. Not for price, or for reward, signifies freely given from Divine Love.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>"Let them relate to you the things which shall happen, declare ye those former things, that we may set our heart, and may know the latter end of them; or cause us to hear things to come, declare to us a sign for the future, that we may know that ye are gods" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_23.htm">23</a>).<p>That to tell things past and to come belongs to the Lord alone, and not to any man or spirit, is expressed by "declare a sign for the future, that we may know that ye are gods"; this concludes that which precedes, therefore to declare a sign is to testify by persuading to believe.<p>In Ezekiel:<p>"Take to thee a pan of iron, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city, and thou shalt set thy faces against it, that it may be for a siege, and thou shalt lay siege to it; this shall be a sign to the house of Israel" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_3.htm">4:3</a>).</p><p>[20] These and the rest of the things in this chapter are representative of the state of the church with the Jewish nation, signifying that they had no truth that was not falsified and adulterated, which in itself is falsity. Such truth is signified by the pan of iron which he was to set for a wall between himself and the city; and because this is hard, like iron, excluding and not admitting any genuine truth, it is said, "that it may be for a siege, and thou shalt lay siege to it." That this sign should be a witness concerning the church as being such is signified by"this shall be a sign to the house of Israel," a sign denoting testification, and the house of Israel the church.</p><p>[21] In David:<p>"The enemy hath destroyed all things in the sanctuary; the enemies roared in the midst of thy feast; they have set their signs for signs. We see not our signs; there is no more a prophet" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_9.htm">9</a>).<p>The enemy hath destroyed all things in the sanctuary, signifies that evil has destroyed the holy things of the church; the enemies have roared in the midst of thy feast, signifies that falsities have destroyed all things of worship; they have set their signs for signs, signifies that they have testified and persuaded by every means. We see not our signs, signifies that no testifications of truth were accepted in the church; there is no more a prophet,signifies no doctrine of truth.</p><p>[22] In the same:<p>Jehovah, "make me a sign for good, that they that hate me may see and be ashamed, that thou, Jehovah, hast helped me, and consoled me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_86_17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>).<p>To make a sign for good, signifies testification that Jehovah will help and console him, as is said afterwards, for this is the good for which Jehovah makes a sign; because a sign is testification of this, therefore it is said, "that they that hate me may see and be ashamed."</p><p>[23] In the same:<p>God, "who setteth fast the mountains by his strength, is girded with power; who maketh the tumult of the seas to cease, the tumult of the waves thereof and the noise of the peoples, that the inhabitants of the uttermost parts may fear because of thy signs" (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>). The tumult of the seas and the tumult of the waves, mean the disputations and reasonings of those who are beneath the heavens, and who are natural and sensual. That seas signify the things of the natural man, thus those who are natural, and that therefore their tumults and waves signify their disputations and reasonings, may also be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>). The noise of the peoples means contradictions from falsities, for peoples signify those who are in truths, and, in the opposite sense, those who are in falsities, as may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>). That the inhabitants of the uttermost parts may fear because of Thy signs, signifies holy worship from faith concerning the Divine Power with those who are in the ultimates of heaven and of the church. That to fear denotes to worship the Lord from charity and faith, may be seen above (n. <a href="../ae/696.htm">696</a>); and that the inhabitants of the uttermost parts denote those who are in the ultimates of heaven and of the church, and are in the faith of charity there, is evident from this, that the uttermost parts are the ultimates of heaven and of the church. From these things it is evident that signs here signify testifications concerning the Lord's Divine Power.</p><p>[24] In Jeremiah:<p>"This shall be a sign unto you, that I will visit upon you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall stand upon you for evil; behold, I give the king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his soul" (<a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>). This is called a sign, because it is a testification that this will come to pass. Therefore it is said, that ye may know that My words shall stand upon you for evil.</p><p>[25] That a sign means testification concerning the certainty of a thing, is evident also from the following passages.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I shall go up into the house of Jehovah?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_22.htm">38:22</a>).<p>In the book of Judges:<p>Gideon said unto the angel of Jehovah, "Show me a sign that thou art he who speaketh to me;" and the sign was this, when he touched with the staff the flesh and unleavened cakes, which Gideon offered, a fire went up out of the rock, and consumed them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_6_17.htm">6:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_6_21.htm">21</a>).<p>In the First Book of Samuel:<p>"This shall be a sign unto thee, which shall come upon thy two sons; in one day they shall both die" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_2_34.htm">2:34</a>).<p>In the same book:<p>"If the Philistines say, Come up unto us, then will we go up, because Jehovah hath given them into our hand; this shall be the sign unto us" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_14_10.htm">14:10</a>).<p>Almost similar things are signified by the "Signs of the covenant" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_17_11.htm">17:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_20.htm">20</a>; and elsewhere), namely, testifications concerning conjunction. Testifications are also signified by the signs performed by the evil which appeared like miracles, in the following passages.</p><p>[26] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah "rendereth vain the signs of the liars, he rendereth the diviners insane, turning the wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_25.htm">44:25</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Jehovah hath said, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them; the statutes of the nations are vanity" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">3</a>).<p>In the Apocalypse:<p>The beast coming up out of the earth "made great signs, so that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, and seduceth them that worship upon the earth, on account of the signs which were given him to do" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_13.htm">13:13</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_14.htm">14</a>).<p>Again:<p>"They are the spirits of demons, making signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth, to gather them together to the war of that great day" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_14.htm">16:14</a>).<p>And again:<p>"The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who made signs before them, by which he seduced them that had received the mark of the beast" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a>).<p>But what is meant by signs upon the hand and in the forehead, may be seen above (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_10.htm">11:10-12</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Set thee up signs, make thee pillars, set thy heart to the highway, the way thou goest" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">31:21</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Announce among the nations, and cause it to be heard, and lift up a sign, Babel is taken" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_2.htm">50:2</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Against the walls of Babel lift up a sign, keep custody, appoint guards; lift up a sign in the land, sound the trumpet among the nations" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_12.htm">51:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_17.htm">17</a>);<p>and elsewhere, especially in the historical parts of the Word. From all that has been quoted from the Word, it is evident that a great sign seen in heaven signifies Divine manifestation and testification, as also in the third verse of this chapter, and afterwards in chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15:1</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Heb. ; Latin, gradus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 706</h4><p>706. Verse <a href="../hh/1.htm">1</a>. And a great sign was seen in heaven, signifies Divine attestation respecting the coming church and the reception of its doctrine, and by whom it will be assaulted. This is evident from the signification of "a great sign in heaven," as being Divine manifestation and attestation; that it has reference to the church and the reception of its doctrine, and also to assault upon it, is evident from what follows, for the "woman" means the church, her "son a male" doctrine, and "the dragon and his angels" and afterwards "the beasts," mean those who will assault the church and its doctrine. This vision is called "a great sign" because a "sign" means Divine manifestation respecting things to come, and attestation, here respecting the coming church and its doctrine, and also the assault upon it by those who are meant by "the dragon" and "the beasts." This is called a "sign," because it manifests and attests. "Sign" and "wonder" are mentioned in many passages in the Word, "sign" meaning that which indicates, witnesses, and persuades respecting the subject of inquiry, and "wonder" meaning that which stirs up, strikes dumb, and fills with amazement; thus a sign moves the understanding and faith, but a wonder the will and its affection, for the will and its affection are what are stirred up, stricken dumb, and filled with amazement, while the understanding and its faith are what are persuaded and moved by indications and proofs.</p><p>[2] That there is a difference between a sign and a wonder is evident from the fact that the Jews, although they had seen so many wonders performed by the Lord, still sought signs from Him; and also from the fact that the prodigies wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness are sometimes called "signs" and sometimes "wonders," and sometimes both. It is further evident from this, that in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of truth and good, and thus also of the understanding and will, for truth is of the understanding and good of the will, consequently "signs" there have reference to things pertaining to truth, and to faith and the understanding, and "wonders" to the things pertaining to good, and to affection and the will. Thence is clear the meaning of "signs" and of "wonders," where they are both mentioned in the Word, as in the following passages. In Moses:<p>I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_7_3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jehovah gave signs and wonders great and evil upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his men <sup>1</sup>(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Hath Jehovah tried to come to take to Him a nation out of the midst of a nation, by wonders, by signs, and by prodigies? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_4_34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>)<p>In David:<p>They remembered not the day in which Jehovah set His signs in Egypt, and His prodigies in the field of Zoan (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_42.htm">Psalms 78:42</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_43.htm">43</a>).<p>In the same:<p>They set among them the words of their <sup>2</sup>signs and wonders in the land of Ham (<a href="../ae/624.htm">624</a>, <a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>).</p><p>[3] In Moses:<p>If there shall arise in the midst of thee a prophet or a dreamer of dreams who shall give thee a sign or a wonder, and if the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, thou shalt not obey (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_13_1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>).<p>Here a "prophet" and a "dreamer of dreams," also "sign" and "wonder" are mentioned, because a "sign" has reference to a prophet, and a "wonder" to a dreamer of dreams, because a "prophet" means one who teaches truths, and in the abstract sense the doctrine of truth, and a "dreamer" means one who stirs up to doing, and in the abstract sense the stirring up from which a thing is done; this, too, pertains to a "wonder," and the former to a "sign;" for prophets were instructed by a living voice from the Lord, and "dreamers" by representatives exciting to doing, which flowed into the affection of the dreamer, and from that into the sight of the thought, for when a man dreams his natural understanding is laid asleep and his spiritual sight is opened, which draws its all from the affection. But in this passage the sight that draws its all from an evil affection is meant, for it treats of prophets who teach falsities and who dream vain things, for "other gods" mean the falsities and vain things that such heard and saw.</p><p>[4] That "signs" signify attestations which indicate and persuade to the belief that a thing is so, is evident from the following passages. In Moses:<p>If they will not believe thee nor hear the voice of the first sign, yet they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And if they will not believe these two signs nor hear thy voice, thou shalt take of the waters of the river and they shall become blood (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_8.htm">Exodus 4:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_9.htm">9</a>).<p>This is said of the wonders wrought by Moses, when the Lord appeared to him in the bush, which are called "signs" because they were to attest and persuade that Moses was sent to lead them out of Egypt; this is why it is three times said "that they may believe," and also "that they may hear his voice."</p><p>[5] In the same:<p>Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will the people not believe in Me for all the signs which I have done in the midst of them? All the men that have seen My glory and the signs which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, they shall not see the land (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_22.htm">22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_14_23.htm">23</a>).<p>These miracles, too, are called "signs," because mention is made of believing; for as has been said, miracles are called "signs" because they persuade and induce faith; and as signs did not induce faith with those who were unwilling on account of fear to enter into the land of Canaan, therefore it is said of them that "they should not see the land." "Signs" have a like signification in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_4_17.htm">Exodus 4:17</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_1.htm">Jeremiah 10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_2.htm">2</a>.</p><p>[6] In the Gospels:<p>The Scribes and Pharisees said, Master, we would see a sign from Thee. But He answering, said, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, but no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the belly <sup>3</sup>of the earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_38.htm">Matthew 12:38-40</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_11_30.htm">30</a>).<p>A "sign" plainly means attestation that they may be persuaded and believe that the Lord was the Messiah and the Son of God who was to come, for the miracles that the Lord wrought in abundance, and that they saw, were no signs to them, because miracles, as has been said above, are signs only with the good. "Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale," and this was taken for a "sign," because it signified the burial and resurrection of the Lord, thus the complete glorification of His Human, "three days and three nights" also signifying completeness.</p><p>[7] In Matthew:<p>The Pharisees and the Sadducees, tempting, asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven. He answering, said to them, When it is evening ye say, It will be fair weather, for the heaven is red. And in the morning, There will be storm today, for the heaven is red and gloomy. Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of heaven, but not the signs of the times. A wicked and adulterous nation requireth a sign, but no sign shall be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a>).<p>Here, too, the "sign" asked from heaven means attestation that they might be persuaded and might believe that the Lord was the Son of God, although miracles were wrought that they did not call signs. The Lord then spoke of evening and of morning because "evening and morning" signifies the Lord's coming; here it means when the church with the Jews was laid waste, who then had "fair weather," because they had no knowledge of the Lord, and lived securely in falsities from evil; this is the "evening;" but when they knew Him, and because of falsities from evils in which they were denied and assaulted Him, this is signified by "the morning when there is a storm." This is why the Lord said, "Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of heaven, but not the signs of the times," that is, the Lord's coming; and because they were "a wicked and adulterous nation," that is, one that adulterated the Word, He said that "no sign should be given unto them."</p><p>[8] So again in Mark:<p>The Pharisees began to dispute with Jesus, seeking of Him a sign from heaven; and He, sighing in His spirit, said, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_11.htm">Mark 8:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_12.htm">12</a>).<p>That a "sign" here signifies attestation by which they might plainly know, acknowledge, and believe, that the Lord was the Messiah and Son of God whom they expected from the predictions in the prophets, is evident from this, that "sighing in spirit, He said, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation;" and this was because if this had been plainly revealed or told them from heaven, and if thus persuaded they had acknowledged and believed it, they would nevertheless have rejected it afterwards, and to reject after acknowledgment and faith is to profane, and the lot of profaners in hell is the worst of all.</p><p>[9] That for this reason plain attestation was not given them from heaven is evident from these words in John:<p>He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and should turn themselves, and I should heal them (<a href="../njhd/172.htm">172</a>.)</p><p>[10] In John:<p>The disciples <sup>4</sup>said unto Jesus, What doest Thou for a sign, that we may see and believe Thee, what workest Thou? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven; for the bread of God is He who cometh down out of heaven and giveth life unto the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_30.htm">John 6:30-33</a>).<p>Here also the disciples <sup>4</sup>desired a sign; that this signifies attestation that they might believe is clear from their saying, "That we may see and believe, what workest Thou?" They then spoke of "manna," and the Lord answered respecting "bread from heaven," because "bread" signifies all good and truth that nourishes the soul, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself, from whom is everything of doctrine and everything of spiritual nourishment, whereby he gave attestation that they might see and believe. Nevertheless attestation, that is, a sign from heaven, was given to the three disciples, Peter, James, and John, as can be seen from the Lord's transfiguration, for they then saw His glory, and heard a voice out of heaven saying, "This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>).</p><p>[11] In John:<p>When Jesus cast out of the temple them that sold therein, the Jews said, What sign showest Thou, that Thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, yet in three days I will raise it up (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_16.htm">John 2:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_19.htm">19</a>).<p>Here evidently "to show a sign" signifies to give attestation by something wonderful, or by a voice out of heaven. But because such an attestation would have damned rather than saved them, as has been said just above, He answered them concerning "the temple," by which He meant His body, that this should be destroyed, that is, should die, and should rise again glorified on the third day. This too is what the Lord meant by "the sign of Jonah in the belly of the whale three days and three nights." (That "temple" in the highest sense signifies the Lord's body, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_21.htm">John 2:21</a>.)</p><p>[12] In Luke:<p>The angels said to the shepherds, There is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord; and this is a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Since a "sign" means attestation that they might believe that the Savior of the world was born, it is said that "they should find Him lying in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes;" but that this was an attestation no one can know until it is known what is meant by a "manger" and by "swaddling clothes." "A manger" means the doctrine of truth from the Word, because "horses" signify the understanding of the Word (as can be seen from what has been shown above, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_11.htm">22:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_14.htm">Mark 14:14</a>; and elsewhere.)<p>Because this was the state with the Jews, who were then in mere falsities, through the adulteration of the Word, this was signified by "there was no place in the inn;" for if it had pleased the Lord He might have been born in a most splendid palace, and have been laid in a bed adorned with precious stones; but He would thus have been with such as were in no doctrine of truth, and there would have been no heavenly representation. He is also said to have been "wrapped in swaddling clothes," because "swaddling clothes" signify first truths, which are truths of innocence, and which are also truths of the Divine love; for "nakedness," in reference to a babe, signifies deprivation of truth. From this it is clear why it was said by the angels, "This is a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger."</p><p>[13] In the Gospels:<p>The disciples said to Jesus, What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age? (<a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a>), therefore further explanation is unnecessary.</p><p>[14] In Mark:<p>Jesus said unto the disciples, These signs shall follow them that believe, In My name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the infirm and they shall be well. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them by signs following (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_17.htm">Mark 16:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_16_20.htm">20</a>).<p>These were miracles, yet still they are called "signs" because they were attestations of the Divine power of the Lord who wrought them; therefore it is said, "The Lord working with them by those signs." If these had been applied to the evil they would have been called "wonders," for with the evil such things only fill with amazement and strike the mind, and still do not persuade to belief; but with the good it is otherwise, for with them the same things are attestations that persuade to belief, and therefore they are called "signs," and it is said "these signs shall follow them that believe." But how these signs can persuade to belief shall be briefly told. These miraculous signs, as that "they should cast out demons," "should speak with new tongues," "should take up serpents," "if they drank any deadly thing it should not hurt them," and "they should become well by the laying on of hands," were in their essence and in their origin spiritual, from which these flowed forth and came forth as effects; for they were correspondences that derived their all from the spiritual world by influx from the Lord. For instance, that "they should cast out demons in the name of the Lord" derived its effect from this, that the name of the Lord understood spiritually means everything of doctrine out of the Word from the Lord, and that "demons" mean falsities of every kind, and these are thus cast out, that is, taken away, by the doctrine out of the Word from the Lord; that "they should speak with new tongues" derives its effect from this, that "new tongues" mean doctrinals for the New Church; "they should take up serpents" was because "serpents" signify the hells in respect to malice, and thus they would be safe from infestation by it; "they would not be hurt if they drank any deadly thing" meant that they would not be contaminated by the malice of the hells; and "the infirm would become well by the laying on of hands" meant to be healed of spiritual diseases, which are called iniquities and sins, by communication and conjunction with heaven, thus with the Lord; the laying on of the hands of the disciples corresponding to communication and conjunction with the Lord, and thus to the removal of iniquities by His Divine power.</p><p>[15] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah said unto Ahaz, Ask thee a sign of Jehovah, direct it into the deep, or lift it up on high. The Lord giveth you a sign, Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son, and shall call His name God-with-us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">14</a>).<p>This was said to Ahaz king of Judah, because the king of Syria and the king of Israel made war against him, even to Jerusalem, and they also had on their side the tribe of Ephraim, and yet they did not prevail, for the reason that "the king of Syria" here represented the external or natural of the church, "the king of Israel" its internal or spiritual, and "Ephraim" its intellectual; but here these three, the natural, the spiritual, and the intellectual, perverted, and these wished to attack the doctrine of truth, signified by "the king of Judah" and by "Jerusalem," wherefore they did not succeed. Nevertheless, in order that Ahaz might be assured of the frustration of their attempt he was told "to ask a sign," that is, an attestation that he might be assured, and the choice was granted him whether it should be from heaven or from hell; this was signified by "direct it into the deep, or lift it up on high," for the king was evil. But because "Jerusalem," which signifies the doctrine of truth from the Word, was not to be destroyed by such before the Lord's coming, there was given him, as an attestation of this, a miraculous sign, namely, that "a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son, whose name shall be God-with-us." That this church would subsequently be destroyed is indicated further on in the same chapter.</p><p>[16] In the same:<p>This shall be a sign to thee from with Jehovah, behold, I will bring back the shadow of the steps which is gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun, ten steps backward, that the sun may return ten steps on the steps which it has gone down (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_7.htm">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>).<p>This sign was given to King Hezekiah as an attestation that the Lord would defend him and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria (as is said in the sixth verse of that chapter), <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_6.htm">Isaiah 38:6</a> that king signifying the perverted rational destroying all things of the church; therefore this sign represented also a New Church that was to be established by the Lord, but here that the time would be protracted beyond that indicated to Ahaz just above; "bringing back the shadow that had gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun" signifies a drawing back of the time before this should be done, "steps of Ahaz" signifying a time, here even until the coming of the Lord, and the "shadow" signifying the progress of time from the rising to the setting; that the shadow "should be drawn backwards ten degrees" signifies the prolongation of the time for many years still, "ten" signifying many, and the "sun" which should go back signifying the Lord's coming.<p>But this shall be further illustrated. The Lord's coming took place when the Jewish Church was at an end, that is, when there was no good or truth left in it; this is meant by "when iniquity was consummated," also by "the fullness of times," in which the Lord was to come. The entire period of the duration of the Jewish Church was represented by "the steps of Ahaz," its beginning by the first step there, which is when the sun is in its rising, and its end by the last when it is at its setting. This makes evident that by "the drawing back of the shadow" from the setting towards the rising means the prolongation of the time. This should take place "in the steps of Ahaz," because Ahaz was a wicked king, and profaned the holy things of the church, consequently if his successors had done the same, the end of that church would have quickly come; but as Hezekiah was an upright king the time was prolonged, for on that account the iniquity of that nation was not so soon to reach its consummation, that is, its end.</p><p>[17] In the same:<p>Say to King Hezekiah, This shall be the sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year that which springeth up of itself, and in the second year that which groweth of its own accord; but in the third year sow ye, reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>).<p>This was said to King Hezekiah when Sennacherib, king of Assyria, made war against him, and spoke proudly of himself and insolently of God and of Israel; in consequence of which also one hundred and eighty <sup>5</sup>thousand were smitten in his camp, and he was himself killed by his sons. This was done because "Assyria" signifies the rational, and "the king of Assyria" the like, and "Judea" the celestial of the church, and "its king" the spiritual of the church; but here "the king of Assyria" signifies the perverted rational, which destroys by false reasonings all the celestial and spiritual things of the church, which are its goods and truths. And as "Judea and its king" signify the celestial and spiritual of the church which will be from the Lord when He comes into the world, therefore these things are said by which is described the regeneration of those who will be of that church. So the sign that the first year "they shall eat that which springeth up of itself" signifies celestial good that the Lord will implant in them; "in the second year that which groweth of its own accord," signifies the truth of that good which shall come from it; "to sow, to reap, to plant vineyards, and to eat the fruit thereof," signifies all the goods and truths that flow forth therefrom, "to sow and reap" signifying the implantation of good and its reception; "to plant vineyards" the implantation of truth and its reception; and "to eat the fruits thereof" the enjoyment of good and joyous things therefrom which the regenerate man has. These things are called "a sign" because they are attestations of a celestial church with those who are meant in the spiritual sense by "Judah," whose regeneration is effected by the Lord by the implantation of celestial good, afterwards by the implantation of spiritual good, which in its essence is the truth of celestial good, and finally by multiplication and fructification in the natural man.</p><p>[18] In the same:<p>Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel and his Former, They have asked Me signs respecting My sons, and respecting the work of My hands they command Me. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways. He shall build My city, and he shall send forth My captivity, not for price nor reward (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_45_13.htm">13</a>).<p>This also treats of the Lord's coming and of the establishment of a church by Him. The Lord is meant by "Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Former," who is called "the Holy One of Israel" from Divine truth, and his "Former" from the establishment of the church by means of truth; and "Israel" means the church; therefore "His sons, respecting whom they asked signs," mean those who are in truths from the Lord, and "the work of His hands" means their formation, and the establishment of a church among them. "I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all His ways" signifies that Divine good and Divine truth are the Lord's, for "righteousness" is predicated in the Word of good, and "ways" signify truths that lead, here Divine truths, because they are predicated of the Lord; "he shall build My city, and he shall send forth My captivity" signifies that He will restore the doctrine of truth, and that He will deliver those who are in falsities from ignorance, "city" signifying the doctrine of truth, and "captivity" the falsities of ignorance in which the Gentiles were, and through which they were in spiritual captivity; "not for price nor reward" signifies freely given from Divine love.</p><p>[19] In the same:<p>Let them declare to you <sup>6</sup>the things that shall happen, declare ye the former things, that we may set our heart and may know the latter end of them; or make us to hear things to come, declare to us a sign for the future, that we may know that ye are gods (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_23.htm">23</a>).<p>That to tell things past and to come belongs to the Lord alone, and not to any man or any spirit, is expressed by "declare a sign for the future, that we may know that ye are gods;" this concludes what precedes, therefore "to declare a sign" means to testify by persuading to believe.</p><p>[20] In Ezekiel:<p>Take to thee a pan of iron, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and thou shalt set thy faces against it, that it may be for a siege, and thou shalt lay siege to it; this shall be a sign to the house of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_4_3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a>).<p>These and the rest of the things in this chapter are representatives of the state of the church with the Jewish nation, signifying that they had no truth that was not falsified and adulterated, which in itself is falsity. Such truth is signified by "the pan of iron" that he should set for a wall between him and the city; and because this, like iron, is hard, shutting out and not admitting any genuine truth, it is said, "that it may be for a siege, and thou shalt lay siege to it;" that this sign should be a witness that the church is such is signified by "this shall be a sign to the house of Israel," "sign" meaning an attestation, and "house of Israel" the church.</p><p>[21] In David:<p>The adversary hath destroyed all things in the sanctuary; the adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy feast; they have set up their own signs for signs. We see not our signs; there is no more a prophet (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_3.htm">Psalms 74:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_74_9.htm">9</a>).<p>"The adversary hath destroyed all things in the sanctuary" signifies that evil has destroyed the holy things of the church; "the adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy feast" signifies that falsities have destroyed all things of worship; "they have set up their own signs for signs" signifies that they have given attestation and persuaded by every means; "we see not our signs" signifies that no attestations of truth were accepted in the church; "there is no more a prophet" signifies no doctrine of truth.</p><p>[22] In the same:<p>Jehovah make a sign with me for good, that they that hate me may see and be ashamed, because Thou, O Jehovah, hast helped me and comforted me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_86_17.htm">Psalms 86:17</a>).<p>"To make a sign for good" signifies attestation that Jehovah will help and comfort him, as follows, for this is the good for which Jehovah makes a sign; and because a sign is an attestation of this it is said "that they that hate me may see and be ashamed."</p><p>[23] In the same:<p>God who setteth fast the mountains by His power is girded with might; He maketh the tumult of the seas to cease, the tumult of its waves and the noise of the peoples, that the dwellers in the uttermost parts may fear because of Thy signs (<a href="../ae/405.htm">405</a>; "the tumult of the seas" and "the tumult of the waves" mean the disputations and reasonings of those who are beneath the heavens, and who are natural and sensual; that "seas" signify the things of the natural man, thus those who are natural, therefore their tumults and waves signify disputations and reasonings, may be seen also above n. <a href="../ae/342.htm">342</a>. "The noise of the peoples" mean contradictions from falsities, for "peoples" signify those who are in truths, and in the contrary sense those who are in falsities (See above, n. <a href="../ae/175.htm">175</a>, <a href="../ae/331.htm">331</a>, <a href="../ae/625.htm">625</a>). "That the dwellers in the uttermost parts may fear because of Thy signs" signifies holy worship from faith in regard to Divine power with those who are in the ultimates of heaven and the church; that "to fear" means to worship the Lord from charity and faith may be seen above n. <a href="../ae/696.htm">696</a>; and that "dwellers in the uttermost parts" mean those who are in the ultimates of heaven and the church, and are in the faith of charity there, is evident, since "the uttermost parts" mean the ultimates of heaven and the church. From this it is clear that "signs" here signify attestations respecting the Lord's Divine power.</p><p>[24] In Jeremiah:<p>This shall be the sign unto you that I will visit upon you in this place, that ye may know that My words shall stand against you for evil. Behold, I give the king of Egypt into the hand of his adversaries and into the hand of them that seek his soul (<a href="../ae/654.htm">654</a>.<p>This is called a "sign," because it is an attestation that this will be done; therefore it is added, "that ye may know that my words shall stand against you for evil."</p><p>[25] That a "sign" means attestation of certainty is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I am to go up into the house of Jehovah? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a>)<p>In the book of Judges:<p>Gideon said to the angel of Jehovah, Show me a sign that it is thou that speakest to me; and the sign was, that when he touched with the staff the flesh and unleavened bread which Gideon had offered, a fire went up out of the rock and consumed them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_6_17.htm">Judges 6:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/judges_6_21.htm">21</a>).<p>In the first book of Samuel:<p>This shall be the sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons, in one day they shall die, both of them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_2_34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>).<p>If the Philistines say, Come up unto us, then will we go up, for Jehovah hath given them into our hand; this shall be the sign unto us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_14_10.htm">1 Samuel 14:10</a>).<p>Nearly the same is signified by:<p>The signs of the covenant (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_17_11.htm">17:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_20_20.htm">20</a>; and elsewhere);<p>namely, attestations respecting conjunction.</p><p>[26] Attestations are signified also by "signs" wrought by the evil that appeared like miracles, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah maketh void the signs of the liars, He rendereth the diviners mad, He turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge stupid (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah hath said, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them. The statutes of the nations <sup>7</sup>are vanity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">3</a>).<p>In Revelation:<p>The beast coming up out of the earth did great signs, so that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, and seduceth them that worship <sup>8</sup>upon the earth, because of the signs that were given him to do (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_14.htm">14</a>).<p>They are the spirits of demons doing signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth, to gather them together unto the war of that great day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>).<p>And again:<p>The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that did signs before him, by which he seduced them that had received the mark of the beast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>).<p>But what is meant by "signs upon the hand and in the forehead" may be seen above n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_10.htm">Isaiah 11:10-12</a>).<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Set thee up signs, place for thee columns, set thine heart to the highway, the way thou mayest go (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Declare ye among the nations, and make to be heard, and lift up an ensign; Babylon is taken (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_50_2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a>).<p>Lift up an ensign against the walls of Babylon, keep the watch, set the watchmen.

From all these passages quoted from the Word it is clear that "a great sign seen in heaven" signifies Divine manifestation and attestation (as also in the third verse of this chapter, an (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>) d afterwards in chap. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_15_1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "house."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "His," as found in <a href="../ar/598.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 598</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;The Greek has "heart," as also found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2798.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2798</a>.<p>4.&nbsp;The context would seem to show that we should read "The people."<br><br>5.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "185,000," as found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4236.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4236</a>.<p>6.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "to us."<br><br>7.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "peoples."<br><br>8.&nbsp;The Greek has "dwell," as found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/826.htm">Arcana Coelestia 826</a>; <a href="../ar/600.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 600</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 706 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>706. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_1" target=_top>1</a>.] "Et signum magnum visum est in caelo." Quod significet testificationem Divinam de futura ecclesia, et de receptione doctrinae ejus, et a quibus impugnabitur, constat ex significatione "signi magni in caelo", quod sit manifestatio et testificatio Divina; quod sit de ecclesia et de receptione doctrinae ejus, tum de impugnatione ejus, constat ex sequentibus: per "mulierem" enim intelligitur ecclesia, per "filium ejus masculum" doctrina, ac per "draconem et angelos", et dein per "bestias", intelliguntur qui ecclesiam et doctrinam ejus impugnaturi sunt. Quod visio illa dicatur "signum magnum" est quia per "signum", intelligitur manifestatio Divina de futuris et testificatio, hic de futura ecclesia et ejus doctrina, et quoque de impugnatione ejus ab illis qui per "draconem" et per "bestias" intelliguntur; haec vocatur "signum" ex eo, quia manifestat et intestatur. In Verbo multis in locis dicitur "signum" et "miraculum"; et per "signum" intelligitur id quod indicat, testatur et persuadet de re quaesita, at per "miraculum" intelligitur id quod excitat, percellit et stuporem inducit; ita signum intellectum et fidem movet, et miraculum voluntatem et ejus affectionem; nam voluntas et ejus affectio est quae excitatur, percellitur et obstupet, ac intellectus et ejus fides est quae persuadetur, cui indicatur, et pro qua testificatio fit.<p>[2] Quod signum et miraculum differant, constare potest ex eo, quod Judaei, tametsi tot miracula a Domino facta viderunt, usque ab Ipso petierint signa; et quoque ex eo, quod prodigia facta in Aegypto et in deserto dicantur nunc "signa" nunc "miracula", et quoque utrumque; ac praeterea constat ex eo, quod in Verbi singulis sit conjugium veri et boni, proinde etiam intellectus et voluntatis, nam verum est intellectus et bonum est voluntatis, et inde quoque signa ibi se referunt ad illa quae veri, ita quae fidei et intellectus sunt, ac miracula ad illa quae boni, ita quae affectionis et voluntatis sunt; inde nunc patet quid per "signa" et quid per "miracula", ubi utraque nominantur in Verbo, in specie intelligitur, ut in sequentibus locis:<p>- Apud Mosen,<p>"Obdurabo cor Pharaonis, ut multiplicem signa mea et miracula mea in tetra Aegypti" (Exod. <sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>2</sup></p><p>domo ejus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_6_22" target=_top>Deuteronomius 6:22</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>Tentavit "Jehovah venire ad accipiendum Sibi gentem e medio gentis per miracula, per signa, et per stupenda" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_4_34" target=_top>Deuteronomius 4:34</a>);<p>apud Davidem,<p>"Non meminerunt... diei, .... quo Jehovah posuit in Aegypto signa.., et prodigia.. in agro Zoanis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_42" target=_top>Psalms 78:42</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_43" target=_top>43</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Posuerunt inter eos verba signorum <sup>3</sup></p><p>Ipsius, et miracula in terra chami" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_105_27" target=_top>Psalms 105:27</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Misit signa et miracula in medium tui, Aegypte, in Pharaonem, et omnes servos ejus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_135_9" target=_top>Psalms 135:9</a>);<p>apud Jeremiam,<p>"Qui posuisti signa et miracula in terra Aegypti, et usque ad diem hunc, etiam in Israele, atque in hominibus, .... et eduxisti populum tuum Israelem e terra Aegypti, per signa et per miracula" ( <sup>4</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_32_20" target=_top>32:20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_32_21" target=_top>21</a>).<p>ex his patet quod prodigia facta in Aegypto, et postea apud filios Israelis, dicantur "signa et "miracula", "signa" quia testificata sunt et persuaserunt, "miracula" quia excitaverunt et stuporem induxerunt; conveniunt tamen in eo, quod quae excitant et stuporem inducunt etiam testificentur et persuadeant, sicut illa quae excitant voluntatem etiam persuadent intellectui, aut sicut illa quae movent affectionem etiam movent cogitationem perSuadendo.

Quod hoc fieret "in gradibus Achasi", erat quia Achasus rex erat malus, et profanavit sancta ecclesiae; quare si successores ejus similiter fecissent, finis illius ecclesiae brevi affuturus esset; at quia Hiskias rex probus erat, prolongatum est tempus, nam iniquitas gentis istius per id non tam cito perventura erat ad consummationem, hoc est, ad finem suum.</p><p>[17] Apud eundem,<p>Dicite ad Hiskiam regem, "Hoc tibi signum; comedere hoc anno sponte nascens, et anno secundo ultro crescens; at in anno tertio serite, metite et plantate vineas, et comedite fructum earum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_706/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_37_30" target=_top>37:30</a>):<p>hoc dictum est ad Hiskiam regem, cum Sancheribus rex Assyriae bellum ei intulit, ac fastuose locutus est de se, et contumeliose de Deo et de Israele; quare etiam percussi sunt in castris ejus <sup>11</sup></p><p>centum et octoginta et quinque millia, et ipse a filiis ejus occisus est.
