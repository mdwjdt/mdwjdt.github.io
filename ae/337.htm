<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 337</h4><p>337. (<a href="../ae/293.htm">293</a>, <a href="../ae/303.htm">303</a>). Here, therefore, It signifies that He procured to Himself everything Divine, from His own power, thus, from merit, and so from justice everything Divine pertains to Him. That this is meant by He is worthy, is clear from what immediately follows, namely, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and honour, and glory, and blessing; by which, in the aggregate, is signified everything Divine; from the signification of lamb, as denoting the Lord as to the Divine Human (concerning which also see above, n. <a href="../ae/314.htm">314</a>); and from the signification of being slain, as denoting His not being acknowledged, and by many denied (concerning which see also above, n. <a href="../ae/315.htm">315</a>, <a href="../ae/328.htm">328</a>). From these considerations it is evident, that by "Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain," is signified acknowledgment from the heart, that everything Divine is from the Lord's Divine Human not acknowledged, and by many denied. That the whole Divine is in the Lord's Human, and from it in heaven and on earth, has been shown in many places, and will be seen confirmed at the end of this work. That to say with a great voice, denotes acknowledgment from the heart, here that it is as has now been stated, is evident from what precedes and follows in a series; moreover, a voice signifies all those things that are afterwards mentioned, and a great voice signifies that they are from the heart. There are two expressions that often occur in the Word, namely great and much, and great is there predicated of good, and much of truths (whence this is, see just above, n. <a href="../ae/336.htm">336</a>); and because what proceeds from good proceeds from the heart, therefore here, by saying with a great voice is signified acknowledgment from the heart; the heart also from correspondence signifies the good of love (see the work concerning <a href="../hh/95.htm">Heaven and Hell 95</a>, <a href="../hh/447.htm">447</a>; and above, n. <a href="../ae/167.htm">167</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 337</h4><p>337. Verse 12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, signifies the acknowledgment from the heart that everything Divine is from the Lord's Divine Human unacknowledged and by many denied. This is evident from the signification of "saying with a great voice," as being the acknowledgment from the heart (of which presently); also from the signification of "worthy," as being, in reference to the Lord, merit and justice (respecting which see above, n. <a href="../ae/293.htm">293</a>, <a href="../ae/303.htm">303</a>); here therefore it signifies that from His own power, thus from merit, He acquired for Himself everything Divine, and so from justice everything Divine is His. That this is meant by "He is worthy," is evident from what immediately follows, namely, "to receive the power and riches and wisdom and honor and glory and blessing;" which in the complex signifies everything Divine. This is evident also from the signification of "the Lamb," as being the Lord in respect to the Divine Human (of which also above, n. <a href="../ae/314.htm">314</a>; also from the signification of "was slain," as meaning unacknowledged and by many denied (of which also above, n. <a href="../ae/315.htm">315</a>, <a href="../ae/328.htm">328</a>). From this it is clear that "Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain," signifies the acknowledgment from the heart that everything Divine is from the Lord's Divine Human unacknowledged and by many denied. That everything Divine is in the Lord's Human, and from it, in heaven and on earth, has been shown in many places, and will be seen confirmed at the end of this work. That "saying with a great voice" means the acknowledgment from the heart, here that it means what has now been stated, can be seen from what precedes and what follows, in series; moreover, "voice" signifies all the things that are afterward said, and "a great voice" signifies that these things are from the heart. There are two words that often occur in the Word, namely, "great" and "many," and "great" is there predicated of good, and "many" of truths (for the reason see just above, n. <a href="../ae/336.htm">336</a>); and as what proceeds from good proceeds from the heart, here "saying with a great voice" signifies the acknowledgment from the heart; moreover, "heart" from correspondence signifies the good of love (See in the work on <a href="../hh/95.htm">Heaven and Hell 95</a>, <a href="../hh/447.htm">447</a>; and above, n. <a href="../ae/167.htm">167</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 337 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>337. [Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_5_12" target=_top>12</a>.] "Dicentes voce magna, Dignus est Agnus occisus." - Quod significet agnitionem corde quod omne Divinum sit ex Divino Humano Domini non agnito et a multis negato, constat ex significatione "dicere voce magna", quod sit agnitio corde (de qua sequitur); ex significatione "digni", cum de Domino, quod sit meritum et justitia (de qua supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_293" target=_top>293</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_303" target=_top>303</a>); hic itaque quod omne Divinum Sibi ex propria potentia, ita ex merito, comparaverit, et sic quod ex justitia omne Divinum Ipsi sit; (quod hoc per "dignus est" intelligatur, constat ex illis quae mox sequuntur, nempe "accipere potestatem et divitias et sapientiam, et honorem et gloriam et benedictionem", per quae in complexu significatur omne Divinum;) ex significatione "Agni", quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_314" target=_top>314</a>); et ex significatione "occisi", quod sit non agniti et a multis negati (de qua etiam supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_315" target=_top>315</a> [a] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_328" target=_top>328</a> [a]): ex his patet quod per "dicentes voce magna, Dignus est Agnus occisus", significetur agnitio corde quod omne Divinum sit ex Divino Humano Domini non agnito et a multis negato. Quod omne Divinum sit in Humano Domini et ex Illo in caelo et in terra, pluribus in locis est ostensum, et id confirmatum videbitur ad finem hujus operis. <p>Quod "dicere voce magna" sit agnitio corde, hic quod ita sit prout nunc dictum est, constare potest ab antecedentibus et sequentibus in serie; praeterea "vox" significat omnia illa quae postea dicuntur, et "vox magna", illa ex corde. Sunt binae voces quae saepius in Verbo occurrunt, nempe "magnum" et "multum", ac "magnum" ibi praedicatur de bono, et "multum" de veris; unde id, videas mox supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_336" target=_top>336</a> [a]); et quia quod procedit ex bono, hoc procedit ex corde, ideo hic per "dicere voce magna" significatur agnitio corde; "cor" etiam ex correspondentia significat bonum amoris (videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_95" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 95</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_447" target=_top>447</a>; et supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_337/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_167" target=_top>167</a>). </p>
