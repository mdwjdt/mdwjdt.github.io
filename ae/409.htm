<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 409</h4><p>409. And every bondman, and every freeman. That this signifies the natural man and the spiritual man, is plain from the signification of bondservant, as denoting the natural man, concerning which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of a freeman, as denoting the spiritual man. The reason why the spiritual man is meant by a freeman, and the natural man by a bondservant, is, that the spiritual man is led by the Lord out of heaven, and to be led by the Lord is freedom, and the natural man obeys and serves it, for it executes what the spiritual man wills and thinks. Bondservant is mentioned in many passages in the Word, and he who does not know that by bondservant therein is meant what is subservient to, and effective of, those things that the spiritual man wills and thinks, may suppose that by a bondservant there is meant one who is in servitude, thus according to the common acceptation of bondservant; but that it is subserving and effecting which is meant, will be evident from the passages in the Word which shall presently be adduced. When servant is mentioned in the Word in this sense, then the natural man, which is meant, is no otherwise a servant than the body is the servant to its soul. And because subserving and effecting are meant by a servant, therefore also servant is not only said of the natural man respectively to the spiritual, but also of men who perform service for others, and of angels who execute God's commands, indeed of the Lord Himself, as to His Divine Human when He was in the world; it is also used of truths from good, because good acts and effects by means of truths, and because truths perform the service to good which [good] wills, and which it loves, and so forth. Moreover, servant is said of the natural man from obedience and effect, although with the regenerate the natural man is equally free and spiritual, since they act as one, like principal and instrumental; but nevertheless the natural man, with respect to the spiritual, is called a servant, because, as stated, the natural man serves the spiritual for effecting. But with those in whom the spiritual man is closed and only the natural man open, the whole man is a servant in a general sense, although, as to appearance, he is as it were free. For the outer natural man is subservient to the evils and falsities which the inner wills and thinks, for thus he is led by hell, and to be led by hell is to be altogether a servant; and such a man also becomes altogether a servant and vile slave in hell after death, for after death, the delights of every one's life are changed into corresponding [things], and the delights of evil into bondage and hideous things (as may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/485.htm">Heaven and Hell 485-490</a>). In this sense also servant is mentioned in the Word; but here it shall principally be shown, that by servant therein is meant what subserves and effects, and this in every respect.</p><p>[2] That by servant is meant what subserves and effects, is plainly evident from this consideration, that the Lord as to His Divine Human is called servant and minister, as in the following passages.<p>In Isaiah<p>"Behold my servant, on whom I recline; mine elect, in whom my soul is well pleased; I have put my spirit upon him; [he shall bring forth judgment to the nations]. Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf as my angel that I send? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the servant of Jehovah?" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_1.htm">42:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_19.htm">19</a>).<p>These words [are spoken] of the Lord, who is treated of in the whole of that chapter, and the Lord is there called a Servant as to Divine Human, because He served His Father by doing His will, as He frequently declares, by which is meant that He reduced to order all things in the spiritual world, and at the same time taught men the way to heaven. It is, therefore, the Divine Human which is meant by, "My servant on whom I recline, and by, mine elect, in whom my soul is well pleased." It is called a servant from the Divine truth, by means of which it accomplished [those things], and Elect from Divine good. That He had Divine truth by means of which He effected [all things], is meant by, "I have put my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the nations." The spirit of Jehovah is the Divine truth, and to bring forth judgment to the nations denotes to instruct. The reason why He is called blind and deaf, is, that the Lord is as if He did not see and perceive the sins of men, for He leads men gently, bending and not breaking them, thus withdrawing them from evils, and leading them to good; therefore neither does He chastise and punish, as if He saw and perceived. This is meant by, "who is blind, but my servant? or deaf as my angel?" He is called blind and hence a servant from the Divine truth, and deaf and hence an angel from the Divine good; for blindness has reference to the understanding and the perception thence, and deafness to perception and the will thence; therefore here that He is as if He did not see, although He possesses the Divine truth from which He understands all things, and as if He did not will according to what He perceives, although He has the Divine good, from which He is able [to effect] all things.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>"He shall see of the labour of his soul, he shall be satisfied; by his knowledge my just servant shall justify many; therefore he hath borne their iniquities" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_11.htm">53:11</a>).<p>These things are also spoken concerning the Lord, who is manifestly treated of in the whole chapter, and indeed concerning His Divine Human. His combats with the hells and His subjugation of them are signified by the labour of His soul, and by, "He hath borne their iniquities," by bearing their iniquities is not meant that He transferred them unto Himself, but that He admitted into Himself the evils which are from the hells, that He might subdue them; this therefore is meant by bearing iniquities. The consequent salvation of those who are in spiritual faith, which is [the faith] of charity, is meant by, "by his knowledge my just servant hath justified many"; knowledge signifying Divine truth, and Divine wisdom and intelligence thence; and many signifying all those who receive; for many, in the Word, is said of truths, but great of good, hence many denote all those who are in truths from good from the Lord. It is said that He hath justified them, because to justify signifies to save from the Divine good, whence also He is called just; because [the Lord] performed and carried out those things from His Divine Human, He is called the Servant of Jehovah; hence it is clear that Jehovah calls His Divine Human His servant, from its subserving and effecting.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>Behold my servant shall act prudently, he shall be extolled and exalted, and shall be greatly praised" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_13.htm">52:13</a>).<p>These also [are spoken of] the Lord, whose Divine Human is called a servant, for the same reason as was mentioned just above; the glorification of His Human is meant by, He shall be extolled, exalted, and shall be greatly praised.<p>In the same:<p>"Ye are my witnesses, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_43_10.htm">43:10</a>).<p>By servant, here, is also meant the Lord as to His Divine Human. That the Lord Himself calls Himself a minister from His serving, is evident in the Evangelists:<p>"Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be first, let him be your servant, even as the Son of Man came not that he might be ministered unto, but that he might minister" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_42.htm">Mark 10:42-44</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the work concerning <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_37.htm">12:37</a>).</p><p>[5] Because by David in the Word is meant the Lord as to Divine truth, and Divine truth serves, therefore David, where the Lord also is meant by him, is everywhere called a servant; as in Ezekiel:<p>"I Jehovah will be their God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4826.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4826</a>; and that the Stone of Israel denotes the Lord as to Divine truth, n. 6426, there.</p><p>[6] Because the Lord as to Divine truth from its serving, is, in the Word, called a servant, therefore they are called servants there who are in Divine truth from the Lord, and thereby serve others, as the prophets in these passages.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_4.htm">25:4</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>"He hath revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_3_7.htm">3:7</a>).<p>In Daniel:<p>"He hath set [his laws] before us by the hand of his servants the prophets" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_10.htm">9:10</a>).<p>Hence also Moses is called,<p>"The servant of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_4_4.htm">Mal. 4:4</a>).<p>And also Isaiah in his prophecy (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_3.htm">20:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_13.htm">52:13</a>). For by the prophets is signified the doctrine of Divine truth, thus the Divine truth as to doctrine (see n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_16.htm">Psalms 119:16</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_65.htm">65</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_124.htm">124</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_125.htm">125</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_135.htm">135</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_176.htm">176</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Guard my soul; for I am holy; save thy servant, for I trust in Thee. Rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. Give strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_86_2.htm">Psalms 86:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_86_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_86_16.htm">16</a>; besides elsewhere, as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_27_9.htm">Psalms 27:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_31_16.htm">31:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_35_27.htm">35:27</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_116_16.htm">116:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>).<p>Because the Lord as to Divine truth is meant by David in the passages adduced above, and because by David is thence meant the Divine truth, the same as by the prophets, therefore, by servant also in these passages, is meant, in the spiritual sense, what is subservient. He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word may suppose that not only David, but also others who are spoken of in the Word, called themselves servants, because all are the servants of God, whereas when servants are mentioned in the Word, what is subservient and efficient is meant thereby in the spiritual sense. It is also for this reason that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is called "the servant of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_43_10.htm">43:10</a>). But specifically by servant and servants, in the Word, are meant those who receive the Divine truth and who teach it, because the Divine truth serves, and Divine good acts by its means. Hence it is that servants and chosen are everywhere mentioned together; servants [denoting] those who receive the Divine truth and teach it, and the chosen those who receive the Divine good and lead [thereto]; as in Isaiah:<p>"I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; that my chosen may possess it, and my servants may dwell there" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_65_9.htm">65:9</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Thou, Israel, art my servant, and Jacob whom I have chosen " (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_41_8.htm">41:8</a>).<p>In the same:<p>"Hear, O Jacob, my servant; Israel, whom I have chosen. Fear not, O Jacob, my servant, and thou Jeshurun, Whom I have chosen" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_1.htm">44:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_2.htm">2</a>).<p>That they are called the chosen who are in the life of charity, may be seen, n. 3755 at the end, 3900.</p><p>[7] Now since servants in the Word are spoken of from subserving and effecting, consequently, those who serve and effect, hence it is that the natural man is called a servant, for this serves the spiritual to carry out what it wills; and hence also the spiritual man is called a free man, and also a master. This also is meant by servant and master in Luke:<p>"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will esteem the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_13.htm">16:13</a>).<p>This is not to be understood of servants in the world, because they can serve two masters, and yet not hate and despise one [of them]; but of servants in the spiritual sense, who are those that desire to love the Lord and themselves equally, also heaven and the world in the same manner. They are like those who wish to look with one eye upwards, and with the other downwards, or with one eye to heaven, and with the other to hell, and so to hang between both; when yet there will be more of one love than of the other; and where this is the case, that which opposes, when it does oppose, will be hated and despised; for the love of self and of the world is opposed to love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. Hence it is, that those who are in heavenly love would be willing rather to die, and be deprived of honours and wealth in the world, than be withdrawn from the Lord and heaven by their means; for they consider the latter to be everything, because it is eternal, but the former respectively nothing, because it ends with life in the world. On the contrary, however, those who love themselves and the world above all things hold the Lord and heaven in no esteem, indeed they even deny them, and when they see them in opposition to them, they hate; this clearly appears to be the case with all such in the other life. With those who love the Lord and heaven above all things, the internal or spiritual man is opened, and the external or natural man serves it; the latter then is a servant because it serves, and the former is a master because it wills; but with those who love themselves and the world above all things, the internal or spiritual man is closed, and the external or natural man open, and when the latter is open, and the former closed, [a man] then loves one master, that is, himself and the world, and hates the other, namely, the Lord and heaven. I can also testify to the same from experience; for all who have lived for themselves and the world, and not, as they ought, for God and heaven, in the other life, hate the Lord, and persecute those who are His, however they may have spoken in the world, of heaven, and also of the Lord; from which it is evident how impossible it is to serve two masters. That those words of the Lord are to be understood spiritually, is evident from the words of the Lord Himself, for He says, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon."</p><p>[8] In Matthew:<p>"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_24.htm">10:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_25.htm">25</a>).<p>By this, in its universal sense, is meant, that man shall not compare himself to the Lord, and that it is sufficient for him that all that he has, he has from the Lord, and then the disciple is as his Master, and the servant as the Lord, for then the Lord is in him, and causes him to will good, and to think truth; he is called a disciple from good, and a servant from truth. It is the same in a particular sense, namely, with every man who is led by the Lord; the external or natural man with him is a disciple and servant, and the internal and spiritual man is a master and lord. When the external or natural man serves the internal or spiritual by obeying and doing, then it is also as its master and lord, for they act as one, as it is said of the principal and instrumental cause, that they act as one cause. This particular sense coincides with the universal in this, that when the spiritual and natural man act as one, then the Lord Himself acts, for the spiritual man does nothing of itself, but what it does it does solely from the Lord; for in proportion as the spiritual man is opened (for it is opened into heaven), in the same proportion [a man] does not act from himself but from the Lord; this spiritual man is the spiritual man in its proper sense.</p><p>[9] In John:<p>"Ye shall know the truth; the truth maketh you free. The Jews answered, We are Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man; how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. The servant abideth not in the house for ever; the son abideth ever. If the son therefore maketh you free, ye shall be free indeed" (<a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>, <a href="../ae/151.htm">151</a>, <a href="../ae/166.htm">166</a>; and to abide in the house denotes [to abide] in heaven. That to be led by hell is to be a servant, is taught by these words, "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." Sin is hell, because from hell.</p><p>[10] That to receive the Divine truth from the Lord in doctrine and in life is to be free, the Lord also teaches in John:<p>"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. I no longer call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; I rather call you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, and ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8973.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8973-9005</a>). From what has been so far adduced, it is evident that those are called servants in the Word who serve and execute, and that hence the natural man is meant by a servant, because this serves its spiritual man to carry out what it wills and thinks; also that those are called free, who act from the love of truth and good, thus who act from the Lord, from whom [comes] the love of truth and good. Moreover, by servants in the Word are also meant those who are led by self and the world, and thence by evils and falsities, consequently, who [are led] by the natural man, and not at the same time by the spiritual. But concerning these servants, the Lord willing, it shall be explained elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 409</h4><p>409. And every servant, and every freeman, signifies the natural man and the spiritual man. This is evident from the signification of "servant," as meaning the natural man (of which presently); and from the signification of "freeman," as meaning the spiritual man. The spiritual man is meant by "freeman" and the natural man by "servant" because the spiritual man is led by the Lord from heaven, and to be led by the Lord is freedom; while the natural man obeys and serves the spiritual, for it executes what the spiritual man wills and thinks. "Servant" is mentioned in many passages in the Word; and one who does not know that in these "servant" means what does service and effects the things the spiritual man wills and thinks, might suppose that "servant" there means one who is in servitude, thus he might understand it in its ordinary sense, but it will be plain from the passages in the Word that will presently be cited that it means what does service and effects. When "servant" is mentioned in the Word in this sense, the natural man is meant by it, which is "a servant" in the same sense as the body is a servant to its soul.<p>As what does service and effects is meant by "servant," so "servant" is predicated not only of the natural man in its relation to the spiritual, but also of men who perform service for others and of the angels who execute God's commands, yea, of the Lord Himself as to His Divine Human when He was in the world; it is also predicated of truths from good, because good acts and produces effects by means of truths, and truths perform the service to good which good wills and loves, and so forth. Moreover, "servant" is predicated of the natural man with regard to obedience and effect, although with the regenerate the natural man is just as free as the spiritual, for they act as one, like principal and instrumental; and yet the natural man, in relation to the spiritual, is called "a servant," because, as was said, the natural man is of service to the spiritual in producing effects. But with those with whom the spiritual man is closed and the natural man only open, the whole man in a general sense is a servant, although in appearance it is like a freeman; for the exterior natural man is subservient to the evils and falsities which the interior wills and thinks, and is thus led by hell, and to be led by hell is to be altogether a servant, and after death such a man also becomes altogether a servant and vile slave in hell; for after death the delights of everyone's life are changed into things that correspond, and the delights of evil are changed into servitude and into loathsome things (See in the work on <a href="../hh/485.htm">Heaven and Hell 485-490</a>). In this sense also "servant" is mentioned in the Word. But here it shall be shown especially that "servant" means what is of service and what effects, and this in every respect.</p><p>[2] That "servant" means what is of service and effects is plainly evident from this, that the Lord in relation to His Divine Human is called "servant" and "minister," as in the following passages. In Isaiah:<p>Behold My servant, on whom I lean, My chosen, in whom My soul is well pleased; I have given My spirit upon Him. [He shall bring forth judgment to the nations]. Who is blind but My servant? or deaf as My angel that I send? Who is blind as He that is perfect, and blind as My <sup>1</sup>servant? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_19.htm">19</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord, who is treated of in the whole of this chapter, and the Lord in respect to His Divine Human is here called "a servant," because He served his Father by doing His will, as He frequently declares; and this means that He reduced to order all things in the spiritual world, and at the same time taught men the way to heaven. Therefore by "My servant on whom I lean," and by "My chosen, in whom My soul is well pleased," the Divine Human is meant; and this is called "a servant" from the Divine truth by which it produced effects, and "chosen" from the Divine good. That it was by means of the Divine truth which belonged to Him that the Lord produced effects is meant by "I have given My spirit upon Him, He shall bring forth judgment to the nations;" "the spirit of Jehovah" meaning the Divine truth, and "to bring forth judgment to the nations" meaning to instruct. He is called "blind" and "deaf" because the Lord is as if He did not see and perceive the sins of men, for He leads men gently, bending and not breaking, thus leading away from evils, and leading to good; therefore He does not chastise and punish, like one who sees and perceives. This is meant by "who is blind but My servant? or deaf as My angel?" He is called "blind" and hence "a servant" from the Divine truth, and "deaf" and hence "an angel" from the Divine good; for "blindness" has reference to the understanding and thence to the perception, and "deafness" to the perception and thence to the will; it is therefore here meant that He as it were does not see, although He possesses the Divine truth from which He understands all things, and that He does not will according to what He perceives, although He has the Divine good, from which He is able to effect all things.</p><p>[3] In the same:<p>He shall see out of the labor of His soul, He shall be satisfied; by His knowledge My just servant shall justify many, in that He hath borne their iniquities (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>).<p>This, too is said of the Lord, of whom the whole chapter evidently treats, and indeed of His Divine Human. His combats with the hells and His subjugation of them are signified by "the labor of His soul," and "He hath borne their iniquities;" "bearing their iniquities" means not that He transferred them unto Himself, but that He admitted into Himself evils from the hells that He might subdue them; this therefore is what is meant by "bearing iniquities." The consequent salvation of those who are in spiritual faith, which is the faith of charity, is meant by the words, "by His knowledge My just servant shall justify many;" "knowledge" signifying Divine truth, and thence Divine wisdom and intelligence, and "many" signifying all who receive; for "many" in the Word is predicated of truths, but "great" of good, therefore "many" means all who are in truths from good from the Lord.<p>It is said that "He shall justify" these, because "to justify" signifies to save by Divine good, and from Divine good He is also called "just." Because the Lord accomplished and effected these things by His Divine Human, He is called "the servant of Jehovah;" this makes clear that Jehovah calls His Divine Human "His servant," because of its serving and effecting.</p><p>[4] In the same:<p>Behold My servant shall act prudently, He shall be exalted, and lifted up, and made exceeding high (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_52_13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>).<p>This, too is said of the Lord, whose Divine Human is called "a servant," for the same reason as was mentioned just above; the glorification of His Human is meant by "He shall be exalted, and lifted up, and made exceeding high." In the same:<p>Ye are My witnesses, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_43_10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>).<p>Here, too, "servant" means the Lord in respect to His Divine Human. That the Lord Himself calls Himself "a minister" from serving is clear in the Gospels:<p>Whosoever will become great among you must be your minister, and whosoever will be first must be your servant, as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_42.htm">Mark 10:42-44</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>).<p>This may be seen explained in the work on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>).</p><p>[5] Since "David" in the Word means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and Divine truth serves, so David also, where the Lord is meant by him, is in many places called "a servant," as in Ezekiel:<p>I Jehovah will be their God, and My servant David a prince in the midst of them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a>).<p>In the same:<p>My servant David shall be king over them, that they all may have one shepherd (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>).<p>This was said of David after his times, when he was never again to be raised up to be a prince in the midst of them, or a king over them. In Isaiah:<p>For I will defend this city to save it for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_37_35.htm">Isaiah 37:35</a>).<p>In David:<p>I <sup>2</sup>have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant, even to eternity will I establish thy seed. I have found David My servant; with the oil of My holiness have I anointed him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4286.htm">Arcana Coelestia 4286</a>; and that "the Stone of Israel," means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6426.htm">6426</a>.)</p><p>[6] Since the Lord in respect to Divine truth is called in the Word "a servant" from serving, so those who are in Divine truth from the Lord and thereby serve others are there called "servants," as the prophets are in these passages. In Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah sent unto you all His servants the prophets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>).<p>In Amos:<p>He hath revealed His secret unto His servants the prophets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_3_7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>In Daniel:<p>He hath set [His laws] before us <sup>3</sup>by the hand of His servants the prophets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_10.htm">Daniel 9:10</a>).<p>So too:<p>Moses is called The servant of Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_4_4.htm">Malachi 4:4</a>).<p>And also Isaiah, in his prophecy (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_20_3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_50_10.htm">50:10</a>).<p>For "prophets" in the Word signify the doctrine of Divine truth, thus Divine truth in respect to doctrine (See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_16.htm">Psalms 119:16-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_65.htm">65</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_124.htm">124-125</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_135.htm">135</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_119_176.htm">176</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Keep my soul, for I am holy; save Thy servant, for I trust <sup>4</sup>in Thee. Gladden the soul of Thy servant; for unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up My soul. Give strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaid (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3755.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3755</a>), n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3755.htm">3755</a> near the end, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3900.htm">3900</a>.)</p><p>[7] Now as "servants" have reference in the Word to what is of service and effects, consequently to such as serve and produce effects, therefore the natural man is called "a servant," since this serves the spiritual in effecting what it wills; and for this reason the spiritual man is also called "a freeman" and "master." This, too, is meant by "servant" and "master" in Luke:<p>No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will prefer the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>).<p>This must be understood as referring, not to servants in the world, for such can serve two masters, and yet not hate and despise one of them, but to servants in a spiritual sense, who are such as desire to love the Lord and themselves equally, or heaven and the world equally. These are like those who wish to look with one eye upwards, and with the other downwards, that is, with one eye to heaven, and with the other to hell, and thus to hang between the two; and yet there must be a predominance of one of these loves over the other; and where there is a predominance, that which opposes will be hated and despised when it offers opposition. For the love of self and of the world is the opposite of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor. For this reason, those who are in the heavenly love would rather die or be deprived of honors and wealth in the world than be drawn away by them from the Lord and from heaven; for this they regard as the all, because it is eternal, but the former as relatively nothing, because it comes to an end with life in the world. On the other hand, however, those who love themselves and the world above all things, regard the Lord and heaven as relatively of no account, and even deny them, and so far as they see that they are opposed to self and the world they hate them; this becomes clearly manifest with all such in the other life. With those who love the Lord and heaven above all things, the internal or spiritual man is open, and the external or natural man serves it; then the latter is a servant because it serves, and the former is a master because it exercises its will; but with those who love themselves and the world above all things, the internal or spiritual man is closed, and the external or natural man is open; and when the latter is open and the former closed, the man loves the one master, namely, himself and the world, and hates the other, namely, the Lord and heaven. To this I am able to bear witness from experience; for all who have lived for self and the world, and not, as they ought, for God and heaven, in the other life hate the Lord and persecute those who are His, however in the world they may have talked about heaven and also about the Lord. From this it can be seen how impossible it is to serve two masters. That these words of the Lord must be understood spiritually is clear from the Lord's own words; for He says, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon. "</p><p>[8] In Matthew:<p>The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_10_26.htm">26</a>).<p>This in the most general sense means that man must not make himself equal to the Lord, and that it is sufficient for him that all that he has he has from the Lord, and then the disciple is as the Teacher, and the servant as the Lord, for then the Lord is in him, and causes him to will good and to think truth. The term "disciple" is used in reference to good and "servant" in reference to truth. It is similar in a particular sense, namely, with each individual who is led by the Lord, the external or natural man with him is "a disciple" and "a servant," and the internal and spiritual man is "a teacher" and "a lord." When the external or natural man serves the internal or spiritual by obeying and carrying into effect, then it also is "as its teacher" and "as its lord," for they act as one, as is said of the principal cause and the instrumental, that they act as one cause. This particular sense coincides with the most general in this, that when the spiritual and natural man act as one, the Lord Himself acts, for the spiritual man does nothing of itself, but what it does comes solely from the Lord; so far, indeed, as the spiritual man has been opened (for this opens into heaven), so far man acts not of himself but from the Lord; this spiritual man is the spiritual man in its proper sense.</p><p>[9] In John:<p>Ye shall know the truth; the truth maketh you free. The Jews answered, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man; how sayest Thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, everyone that committeth sin is a servant of sin. The servant abideth not in the house forever; the Son abideth forever. If the Son therefore make you free ye shall be free indeed (<a href="../ae/63.htm">63</a>, <a href="../ae/151.htm">151</a>, <a href="../ae/166.htm">166</a>), and "to abide in the house" meaning to abide in heaven. That to be led by hell is slavery is taught by these words, "everyone that committeth sin is a servant of sin," "sin" is hell because it is from hell.</p><p>[10] That to receive Divine truth from the Lord in doctrine and in life is to, be free the Lord teaches also in John:<p>Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you. No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; I rather call you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known unto you. Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and appointed you that ye may go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit may abide (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8973.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8973</a>-<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9005.htm">9005</a>.)<p>From what has been thus far set forth it can be seen that those are called "servants" in the Word who serve and bring into effect, and that therefore "servant" means the natural man, because this serves its spiritual man by bringing into effect what it wills and thinks; also that those are called "freemen" who act from the love of truth and good, thus who act from the Lord, from whom is the love of truth and good. Moreover, "servants" in the Word mean also those who are led by self and the world, and thence by evils and falsities, consequently who are led by the natural man and not at the same time by the spiritual. But respecting these servants, the Lord willing, it shall be told elsewhere.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "My," but Hebrew has "of Jehovah," as also found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2159.htm">AC 2159</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "He hath made," but Hebrew has "I have made," as also in <a href="../ae/205.htm">AE 205</a>, <a href="../ae/608.htm">608</a>, <a href="../ae/684.htm">684</a>, <a href="../ae/701.htm">701</a>, etc.<p>3.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "you;" for Hebrew "us."<br><br>4.&nbsp;The photolithograph has "for I trust;" Hebrew "that trusteth." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 409 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>409. "Et omnis servus et omnis liber." Quod significet hominem naturalem et hominem spiritualem, constat ex significatione "servi", quod sit homo naturalis (de qua sequitur); et ex significatione "liberi", quod sit homo spiritualis. Quod homo spiritualis intelligatur per "liberum", et homo naturalis per "servum", est quia homo spiritualis ducitur e caelo a Domino, et duci a Domino est liberum, ac homo naturalis ei obedit et inservit, praestat enim illa quae spiritualis homo vult et cogitat. In Verbo in pluribus locis dicitur "servus"; et qui non scit quod in illis per "servum" intelligatur inserviens et efficiens illa quae spiritualis homo vult et cogitat, opinari potest quod per "servum" ibi intelligatur servus qui in servitute est, ita secundum communem notionem de servo; sed quod sit inserviens et efficiens qui intelligitur, patebit ex locis in Verbo, quae mox adducentur. Cum "servus" in hoc sensu in Verbo dicitur, tunc homo naturalis, qui per illum intelligitur, non aliter est servus quam sicut corpus est servus suae animae; et quia inserviens ac efficiens intelligitur per "servum", ideo etiam "servus" dicitur non solum de naturali homine respective ad spiritualem, sed etiam de hominibus qui aliis operam praestant, deque angelis qui efficiunt mandata Dei, immo de Ipso Domino quoad Divinum Humanum Ipsius cum fuit in mundo; et quoque dicitur de veris ex bono, quia bonum per vera agit et efficit, ac quia vera praestant operam bono quod vult et quod amat, et sic porro. Praeterea "servus" dicitur de naturali homine ex obedientia et effectu, tametsi homo naturalis apud regeneratum aeque est liber et spiritualis, quoniam unum agunt sicut principale et instrumentale; sed usque naturalis homo respective ad spiritualem vocatur "servus", ex causa, quae dicta est, quod naturalis inserviat spirituali efficiendo: at vero apud illos apud quos spiritualis homo occlusus est, et modo naturalis homo apertus, est totus homo servus in communi sensu, tametsi quoad apparentiam est sicut liber; inservit enim exterior naturalis homo malis et falsis quae interior vult et cogitat, sic enim ducitur ab inferno, et duci ab inferno est prorsus servum, et quoque talis homo fit prorsus servus et vile mancipium in inferno post mortem; post mortem enim jucunda vitae cujusvis vertuntur in correspondentia, et jucunda mali in servitia et in tetra (videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_485" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 485-490</a>) in hoc sensu etiam nominatur "servus" in Verbo. Sed hic praecipue ostendetur quod per "servum" ibi intelligatur inserviens et efficiens, et hoc in omni respectu.<p>[2] Quod per "servum" intelligatur inserviens et efficiens, patet manifeste ex eo, quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum suum dicatur "Servus" et "Minister", ut in sequentibus his locis:<p>Apud Esaiam,<p>"Ecce Servus meus in quem incumbo, Electus meus beneplacitum habet anima mea; dedi Spiritum meum super Illum (, judicium gentibus proferet). ...Quis caecus nisi Servus meus, aut surdus sicut Angelus meus quem mitto? quis caecus sicut consummatus, et caecus sicut Servus <sup>1</sup></p><p>Jehovae?"

Est itaque Divinum Humanum quod intelligitur per "Servum meum in quem incumbo", et per "Electum meum in quo beneplacitum habet anima mea." "Servus" dicitur ex Divino Vero per quod effecit, et "Electus" ex Divino Bono. Quod Ipsi fuerit Divinum Verum, per quod effecit, intelligitur per "Dedi Spiritum meum super Illum, judicium gentibus proferet"; "Spiritus Jehovae" est Divinum Verum, et "judicium proferre gentibus" est instruere; quod dicatur "caecus" et "surdus", est quia Dominus est sicut non videat et percipiat peccata hominum; ducit enim homines leniter, nam flectit et non frangit, sic abducendo a malis et ducendo ad bonum; quare nec castigat et punit sicut qui videns est et percipiens; hoc intelligitur per "Quis caecus nisi Servus meus, aut surdus sicut Angelus meus?" "Caecus" dicitur et inde "servus" ex Divino Vero, et "surdus" et inde "Angelus" ex Divino Bono, nam "caecus" se refert ad intellectum et inde perceptionem, ac "surdus" ad perceptionem et inde voluntatem; ibi itaque quod sicut non videat tametsi Ipsi Divinum Verum e quo intelligit omnia, et non secundum quod percipit velit, tametsi Ipsi Divinum Bonum e quo omnia potest.<p>[3] Apud eundem,<p>"Ex labore animae suae videbit, saturabitur, per scientiam suam justificabit justus Servus meus multos, eo quod iniquitates eorum Ipse portaverit" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_53_11" target=_top>Esaiam 53:11</a>);<p>haec quoque de Domino, de quo in toto capite manifeste agitur, et quidem de Divino Humano Ipsius: pugnae Ipsius cum infernis et subjugatio eorum significatur per "laborem animae Ipsius", et per quod "iniquitates eorum portaverit"; per "iniquitates eorum portare" non intelligitur quod in Se transtulerit eas, sed quod admiserit in Se mala quae ab infernis ut subjugaret illa; hoc itaque intelligitur per "portare iniquitates": salvatio inde eorum qui in fide spirituali, quae est charitatis, sunt, intelligitur per quod "per scientiam suam justificaverit justus Servus meus multos"; "scientia" significat Divinum Verum, et inde Divinam sapientiam et intelligentiam, et "multi" significant omnes qui recipiunt; nam "multum" in Verbo dicitur de veris, "magnum" autem de bono; inde "multi" sunt omnes qui in veris ex bono ab Ipso sunt: quod hos "justificaverit" dicitur, quia "justificare" significat salvare ex Divino Bono, ex quo etiam dicitur "justus"; quia illa ex Divino Humano suo peregit et effecit, dicitur "Servus Jehovae": inde patet quod Jehovah Divinum Humanum suum vocet "Servum suum" ex inserviendo et efficiendo.<p>[4] Apud eundem,<p>"Ecce prudenter aget Servus meus, extolletur et exaltabitur et evehetur valde" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_52_13" target=_top>52:13</a>):<p>etiam haec de Domino, cujus Divinum Humanum vocatur "Servus", ex eadem causa de qua mox supra; glorificatio Humani Ipsius intelligitur per "extolletur, exaltabitur et evehetur valde."

Qui non scit sensum spiritualem Verbi, credere potest quod non solum David, sed etiam reliqui de quibus in Verbo, se dixerint "servos" ex causa quia omnes sunt servi Dei; at usque ubi in Verbo nominantur "servi", in spirituali sensu intelliguntur inservientes et efficientes. Ex qua causa etiam<p>Nebuchadnezar Rex Babelis vocatur "servus Jehovae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_25_9" target=_top>Jeremias 25:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_43_10" target=_top>43:10</a>).<p>At in specie per "servum" et "servos" in Verbo intelliguntur illi qui recipiunt Divinum Verum, ac qui docent illud, quoniam Divinum Verum inservit, et per id Divinum Bonum efficit. Inde est quod passim dicantur "servi" et simul "electi"; "servi" qui recipiunt Divinum Verum et docent, ac "electi" qui recipiunt Divinum Bonum et ducunt:<p>Ut apud Esaiam,<p>"Producam ex Jacobo semen, et ex Jehudah heredem montium meorum, ut possideant eum electi mei, et servi mei habitent ibi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_65_9" target=_top>65:9</a>):<p>apud eundem,<p>"Tu Israel servus meus, et Jacobus quem elegi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_41_8" target=_top>41:8</a>);<p>apud eundem,<p>"Audi, Jacob serve mi, Israel quem elegi;... ne time, serve mi Jacob, et Jeschurun quem elegi" ( <sup>10</sup></p><p><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_44_1" target=_top>44:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_44_2" target=_top>2</a>).<p>(Quod "electi" dicantur qui in vita charitatis sunt, videatur n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3755" target=_top>3755</a> fin. , <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3900" target=_top>3900</a>.)<p>[7] Quia nunc "servi" in Verbo dicuntur ex inserviendo et efficiendo, proinde illi qui inserviunt et efficiunt, inde est quod naturalis homo dicatur "servus", is enim inservit spirituali efficiendo quod vult; et inde quoque spiritualis homo dicitur "liber", ut et "dominus." Hoc quoque intelligitur per "servum" et "dominum" apud Lucam,<p>"Nullus servus potest duobus dominis servire, aut enim unum odio habebit et alterum amabit, aut unum praeferet et alterum contemnet; non potestis Deo servire et mammonae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_13" target=_top>16:13</a>):<p>hoc non intelligendum est de servis in mundo (quoniam illi possunt servire duobus dominis, et usque non odio habere et contemnere unum), sed de servis in spirituali sensu, qui sunt qui volunt amare Dominum et aeque semet, ac caelum et aeque mundum. Illi sunt sicut qui uno oculo volunt spectare sursum et altero deorsum, seu uno oculo ad caelum et altero ad infernum, et sic pendere inter utrumque; cum tamen praedominium erit amorum, unius prae altero; et ubi praedominium est, ibi odio habetur et contemnitur quod se opponit, et cum se opponit. Nam amor sui et mundi est oppositus amori in Dominum et amori erga proximum: inde est quod qui in amore caelesti sunt, potius velint mori, ac deprivari honoribus et facultatibus in mundo, quam ut per illa abstrahantur a Domino et a caelo, hoc enim considerant ut omne quia est aeternum, at illud ut nihili respective quia finem cum vita in mundo habet: vicissim autem illi qui se et mundum super omnia amant, vilipendunt respective Dominum et caelum, immo etiam negant, et quando oppositum in illis vident odio habent; hoc manifeste apparet apud omnes tales in altera vita.<p>Apud illos qui Dominum et caelum super omnia amant, est internus seu spiritualis homo apertus, et ei inservit externus seu naturalis homo; hic tunc est servus quia inserviens, et ille est dominus quia volens; at apud illos qui se et mundum super omnia amant, est internus seu spiritualis homo occlusus, et externus seu naturalis homo apertus; et quando hic apertus et ille occlusus est, tunc amat unum dominum, nempe se et mundum, ac odio habet alterum, nempe Dominum et caelum; idem quoque testari possum ab experientia, omnes enim qui sibi et mundo vixerunt, et non, sicut oportet, Deo et caelo, in altera vita Dominum odio habent, et illos qui Ipsius sunt persequuntur, qualitercunque in mundo locuti sunt de caelo et quoque de Domino: ex quibus constare potest quod impossibile sit duobus dominis servire. Quod illa Domini verba spiritualiter intelligenda sint, patet ab Ipsius Domini verbis, nam dicit, "Non potestis Deo servire et mammonae."<p>[8] Apud Matthaeum,<p>"Non est discipulus supra magistrum, neque servus supra dominum; sufficiens est discipulo ut sit sicut magister suus, et servo sicut dominus suus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_10_24" target=_top>10:24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_10_25" target=_top>25</a>):<p>per hoc in universali sensu intelligitur quod homo non aequiparabit se Domino, et quod sufficiat ei quod omne suum ab Ipso habeat; et tunc est discipulus sicut magister, et servus sicut Dominus, nam tunc est Dominus in illo, ac facit eum velle bonum et cogitare verum; "discipulus" dicitur ex bono, et "servus" ex vero. Simile est in sensu Singulari, nempe apud unumquemque hominem, qui ducitur a Domino: externus seu naturalis homo apud illum est "discipulus" et "servus", ac internus et spiritualis homo est "magister" et "dominus"; quando externus seu naturalis homo inservit interno seu spirituali, obediendo et efficiendo, tunc est is etiam "sicut magister" et "sicut dominus", unum enim agunt, sicut dicitur de causa principali et instrumentali quod unam causam agant. Singularis hic sensus coincidit in eo cum universali, quod, cum spiritualis et naturalis homo unum agunt, tunc Ipse Dominus agat; nam spiritualis homo nihil ex se agit, sed quod agit unice agat ex Domino: quantum enim spiritualis homo apertus est (hic enim aperitur in caelum), tantum non agit ex se sed a Domino; hic spiritualis homo est in proprio sensu spiritualis homo.<p>[9] Apud Johannem,<p>"Cognoscetis veritatem, veritas vos liberos facit: responderunt" Judaei, "Semen Abrahami sumus, et nemini servi fuimus unquam; quomodo Tu dicis quod liberi fietis? Respondit illis Jesus, Amen amen dico vobis, quod omnis faciens peccatum est servus peccati; servus non manet in domo in perpetuum, filius manet in perpetuum; si ergo Filius vos liberos facit, Vere liberi eritis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_32-36" target=_top>8:32-36</a>):<p>per haec intelligitur quod liberum sit duci a Domino, et quod servum sit duci ab inferno: per "veritatem", quae liberum facit, intelligitur Divinum Verum quod a Domino; qui enim id recipit doctrina et vita, is liber est, quia spiritualis fit, et ducitur a Domino; quare etiam dicitur quod "filius maneat in domo in perpetuum; si Filius vos liberos facit, vere liberi eritis", per "Filium" intelligitur Dominus, et quoque veritas (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_63" target=_top>63</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_151" target=_top>151</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_166" target=_top>166</a>); et "manere in domo" est in caelo: quod duci ab inferno sit servum, docetur per haec verba, "Omnis faciens peccatum servus est peccati"; "peccatum" est infernum quia ab inferno.</p><p>[10] Quod recipere Divinum Verum a Domino doctrina et vita sit liber esse, etiam Dominus docet apud Johannem,<p>"Vos amici mei estis si feceritis quaecumque mando vobis; non amplius vos dico servos, quia servus non scit quid ejus Dominus facit; vos potius dico amicos, quia omnia quae audivi a Patre meo nota feci vobis; non vos elegistis Me, sed Ego elegi vos, et posui vos ut vos abeatis et fructum feratis, et fructus vester maneat" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_14-16" target=_top>15:14-16</a>):<p>per "amicos" hic intelliguntur liberi, quoniam "amici" ibi opponuntur "servis": quod illi non Servi sint sed amici seu liberi qui recipiunt Divinum Verum doctrina et vita a Domino, docetur per haec verba, "Si feceritis quaecunque mando vobis, non amplius vos dico servos sed amicos"; tum per haec, "Omnia quae audivi a Patre meo nota feci vobis, ut vos abeatis et fructum feratis"; "mandare" et "nota facere" est doctrinae, ac "fructum ferre" est vitae; quod haec a Domino, docetur ita, "Non vos elegistis Me, sed Ego elegi vos, et posui vos."<p>Simile paene per servos Hebraeos, qui anno septimo et anno Jubilaei in libertatem missi sunt, repraesentatum est (De quibus <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_21_2" target=_top>Exodus 21:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_21_3" target=_top>3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_25_39-41" target=_top>Leviticus 25:39-41</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_15_12" target=_top>Deuteronomius 15:12</a>, seq.; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_34_9" target=_top>Jerem. 34:9</a> <sup>11</sup></p><p>, seq.).<p>(Sed de his videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_409/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8973" target=_top>8973-9005</a>.)
