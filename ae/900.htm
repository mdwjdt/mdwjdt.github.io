<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Tansley translation 1923) 900</h4><p>900. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours. That this signifies, that they shall have to fight no longer against evils and falsities, nor suffer infestation from them, is evident from the signification of, saith the Spirit, as denoting asseveration that it is true. For by "angel" is signified truth from the Lord; the same also is meant by "spirit"; and from the signification of labours, as denoting combats against evils and falsities, and also infestation from them, thus, temptations; of which we shall speak presently. Hence to rest from them, signifies, that they shall no longer be in them. It is evident, therefore, that by the Spirit saying, that they may rest from their labours, is signified, that it is true that they shall have to fight no longer against evils and falsities, nor suffer infestation from them.<p>In the preceding verse, the subject treated of is the temptations of those who live according to the Lord's precepts, and who acknowledge His Divine; therefore in this verse the consolations which follow spiritual temptations, are treated of. For, as was said above (n. <a href="../ae/897.htm">897</a>), joys come into being after all spiritual temptations.</p><p> [2] The reason why by labours are meant temptations is, that temptations are labours of the soul, or spiritual labours. They are also meant by labour in Isaiah:<p>"Jehovah willed to bruise him, he weakened him; if he shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the will of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand; he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied" (<a href="../ae/629.htm">629</a>); and days signify states. And the will of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand, signifies that thus all things in general and particular, in the heavens and on the earth, shall be kept in Divine Order. Of the labour of his soul, signifies by temptations. He shall see, and shall be satisfied, signifies glorification. These things are signified by these words, in the highest sense, in which the Lord is treated of. But, in the relative sense, by the same words, the salvation of the human race, for which the Lord fought from Divine Love is described. It is said, if he shall make his soul an offering for sin, as if it were a matter of doubt that he would so make it.</p><p>[3] But this involves the same as that which He Himself says in John:<p>"I lay down my soul, and I take it again; no one taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from my Father" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_17.htm">10:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_18.htm">18</a>).<p>The mystery that lies hid in these words, only he can see who knows the nature of the temptations by which man is regenerated. For a man therein is preserved in his own freedom, from which it appears to him as if he fought from himself. In fact, in temptations a man has spiritual freedom more strongly than when not in them; for it is more interior. Unless he fought from it in temptations, he could not become spiritual; for all freedom is of love; a man therefore then fights from the love of truth, and consequently from the love of life everlasting. Thus and no otherwise is the internal opened, and a man regenerated. From these few things, it may in some degree be seen what these words of the Lord involve, that is, that He fought from His own freedom, and at last laid down His soul, in order that He might do all things from His own proper power, and consequently might become righteousness, from Himself; this He could not have become except by virtue of His freedom. Hence it is said, "I lay down my soul of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command have I received from my Father."</p><p>[4] Those who do not know this mystery, interpret these words like the Arians, saying that the Lord was not the actual, but the adopted, Son of God; thus, that He was adopted because He was willing to lay down His life, or undergo the death of the cross. They do not know that those words involve that He, by His own power, fought from His Human against the hells and overcame them, and by His own proper power glorified His Human, that is, united it to the very Divine in Himself, and by that means made it Divine; and this, had he not been left to Himself in absolute freedom as to the Human, could not have been accomplished. From these things it is now evident why it is said in Isaiah, "If he shall make his soul an offering for sin."<p>That freedom is that which belongs to the love and the will, and thence to the life of man, and that this appears to be, as it were, his own, may be seen in the <a href="../njhd/141.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem 141</a>, <a href="../njhd/145.htm">145</a>). That a man must be in a state of freedom in order to be regenerated, may be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1937.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1937</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2876.htm">2876</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2881.htm">2881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3145.htm">3145</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3158.htm">3158</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4031.htm">4031</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8700.htm">8700</a>). That otherwise the love of good and truth cannot be implanted in man, and appear to be appropriated to him as his own (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2877.htm">2877</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2879.htm">2879</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2880.htm">2880</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8700.htm">8700</a>). That nothing that is done from compulsion can be conjoined to a man (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2875.htm">2875</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8700.htm">8700</a>). That to compel oneself, is from freedom; but not to be compelled (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2881.htm">2881</a>). That in all temptation there is freedom, but that this freedom is more interiorly within a man from the Lord; this is why he fights and desires to conquer, and not to be conquered, which without freedom he would not do (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2881.htm">2881</a>). That the Lord alone fought against all the hells, and from His own proper power, and overcame them (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1692.htm">1692</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2826.htm">2826</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8273.htm">8273</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9937.htm">9937</a>). That hence the Lord was made righteousness, from Himself alone (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2027.htm">2027</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10019.htm">10019</a>). That the Lord's last temptation was in Gethsemane and upon the cross, when He obtained complete victory, by means of which He subjugated the hells, and at the same time glorified His Human (n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2276.htm">2276</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2814.htm">2814</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10655.htm">10655</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10659.htm">10659</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10828.htm">10828</a>). All these things are from the Arcana Coelestia, still more may be seen collected from the same work in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, where man's freedom is treated of (n. <a href="../ae/148.htm">148</a>, <a href="../ae/149.htm">149</a>); concerning temptations in general (n. <a href="../njhd/196.htm">196-200</a>); and concerning the Lord's temptations (n. <a href="../njhd/201.htm">201</a>, <a href="../njhd/302.htm">302</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Explained (Whitehead translation 1912) 900</h4><p>900. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, signifies that such will henceforth be free from combat against evils and falsities, and from infestation by them. This is evident from the signification of "saith the Spirit," as being assertion that it is true, for "angel," likewise "Spirit," signifies truth from the Lord. Also from the signification of "labors," as being combats against evils and falsities and infestations by them, thus temptations (of which presently), therefore "to rest from them" signifies that they will henceforth be free from them. This makes evident that "the Spirit saith, that they may rest from their labors," signifies that it is true that they will henceforth be free from combat against evils and falsities, and from infestation by them. The preceding verse treats of the temptations of those who live according to the Lord's commandments and who acknowledge His Divine, therefore this verse treats of the consolations that follow spiritual temptations; for, as has been said above n. <a href="../ae/897.htm">897</a>, after all spiritual temptations joys come forth.</p><p>[2] "Labors" mean temptations, because temptations are labors of the soul or spiritual labors; and these are meant by "labor" in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah hath willed to bruise him, He hath weakened him; if He hath made his soul a guilt-offering, he shall see seed, he shall prolong days, and the will of Jehovah shall prosper by his hand; he shall see of the labor of his soul and shall be satisfied (<a href="../ae/629.htm">629</a>), and "days" signifying states. "And the will of Jehovah shall prosper by his hand" signifies that thus all things and each thing in the heavens and in the earths shall be kept in Divine order; "of the labor of his soul" signifies by temptations; "he shall see and shall be satisfied" signifies glorification. This is the signification of these words in the highest sense, which treats of the Lord. But in a relative sense they describe the salvation of the human race, for which the Lord fought from Divine love.</p><p>[3] It is said, "If he hath made his soul a guilt-offering," as if it were a matter of doubt whether he would so make it. But the same truth is involved in this as in what He Himself says in John:<p>I lay down My soul that I may take it again; no man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from My Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_17.htm">John 10:17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_18.htm">18</a>).<p>The arcanum that is concealed in these words no one can see unless he knows what the temptations are by which man is regenerated. For in these man is kept in his freedom; from which it appears to him as if he fought from himself. In fact, man has in temptations a more potent spiritual freedom than when he is not in them, for it is more interior. Unless man fought from this freedom in temptations he could not become spiritual; for all freedom is of the love, therefore man then fights from the love of truth, and thus from the love of eternal life; and in this and in no other way is the internal opened and man regenerated. From these few things it can be seen in some degree what is involved in these words of the Lord, namely, that he fought from His own freedom and finally laid down His soul that He might do all things from His own power, and thus might become righteousness from Himself, which He could not have become except from His freedom; and this is why it is said, "I lay down My soul of Myself; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from My Father."</p><p>[4] Those to whom this arcanum is unknown interpret these words as the Arians do, that the Lord was the adopted not the actual Son of God; thus that He was adopted because He was willing to lay down His life, or endure the death of the cross; not knowing that these words involve that from His own power He fought against the hells from His Human and overcame them, and from His own power He glorified His Human, that is, united it to the very Divine in Himself, and thus made it Divine; and that this could by no means have been done if absolute freedom had not been left to Him as to the Human. All this makes clear why it is said in Isaiah, "If He hath made his soul a guilt-offering."<p>(That freedom is that which is of the love and of the will and thus of the life of man, and that it appears as if it were his own [proprium], can be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. <a href="../njhd/141.htm">141</a>, <a href="../njhd/145.htm">145</a>).<p>That man must have freedom in order to be regenerated can be seen in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1937.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1937</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2876.htm">2876</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2881.htm">2881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3145.htm">3145</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3158.htm">3158</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4031.htm">4031</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8700.htm">8700</a>.<p>That in no other way can the love of good and truth be implanted in man and be appropriated to him, apparently as his own, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2877.htm">2877</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2879.htm">2879</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2880.htm">2880</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8700.htm">8700</a>.<p>That nothing is conjoined to man that is done by compulsion, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2875.htm">2875</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8700.htm">8700</a>.<p>That to compel oneself is from freedom, but not to be compelled, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2881.htm">2881</a>.<p>That in all temptation there is freedom, but this freedom is more interiorly in man from the Lord, and for this reason he fights and wishes to conquer and not to be conquered, which he would not do without freedom, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2881.htm">2881</a>.<p>That the Lord fought alone and from His own power against all the hells, and overcame them, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1692.htm">1692</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2816.htm">2816</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8273.htm">8273</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9937.htm">9937</a>.<p>That thus the Lord became righteousness from Himself alone, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2025.htm">2025-2027</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10019.htm">10019</a>.<p>That the Lord's last temptation was in Gethsemane and upon the cross, when He gained a complete victory, by which He subjugated the hells, and at the same time glorified His Human, n. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2814.htm">2814</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10655.htm">10655</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10659.htm">10659</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10828.htm">10828</a>.<p>All these are from the Arcana Coelestia, from which still more may be seen collected in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, under the heads,<p>The Freedom of Man, n. <a href="../njhd/148.htm">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine 148</a>, <a href="../njhd/149.htm">149</a>;<p>Temptations in General, n. <a href="../njhd/196.htm">196-200</a>;<p>The Lord's Temptations, n. <a href="../njhd/201.htm">201</a>, <a href="../njhd/302.htm">302</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Explicata 900 (original Latin 1759)</h4><p>900. "Immo dicit Spiritus, ut requiescant a laboribus suis." Quod significet quod illis non amplius pugna contra mala et falsa, ac infestatio ab illis, constat ex significatione "dicit Spiritus", quod sit asseveratio quod verum sit, per "angelum" enim significatur verum a Domino, similiter per "Spiritum"; ex significatione "laborum", quod sint pugnae contra mala et falsa, ac infestationes ab illis, ita tentationes (de qua sequitur); inde "requiescere ab illis" significat quod non amplius in illis erunt; inde patet quod per "Dicit Spiritus, ut requiescant a laboribus suis", significetur quod verum sit quod illis non amplius pugna contra mala et falsa, ac infestatio ab illis. In praecedente versu agitur de tentationibus illorum qui vivunt secundum praecepta Domini, et qui agnoscunt Divinum Ipsius; quare in hoc versu agitur de consolationibus, quae tentationes spirituales sequuntur; nam ut supra (n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_900/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_897" target=_top>897</a>) dictum est, gaudia post omnes tentationes spirituales existunt. Quod per "labores" intelligantur tentationes, est quia tentationes sunt labores animae, seu labores spirituales.<p>[2] Illae etiam per "laborem" intelliguntur apud Esaiam,<p>"Jehovah voluit conterere Ipsum, infirmavit; si posuerit reatum animam suam, videbit semen, prolongabit dies, et voluntas Jehovae per manum Ipsius prosperabitur: ex labore animae suae videbit, saturabitur" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_900/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_53_10" target=_top>53:10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_900/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_53_11" target=_top>11</a>):<p>haec de Domino <sup>1</sup></p><p>de quo in toto illo capite agitur; tentationes Domini quae gravissimae fuerunt, quia contra inferna, describuntur, per quod "Jehovah voluerit conterere Ipsum, infirmavit; nam per tentationes amores proprii infringuntur, ita corpus conteritur ac infirmatur; "si posuerit reatum animam suam", significat, si tentationes usque ad mortem subiverit; "videbit semen", significat quod Divinum Verum procedet ab Ipso ("semen" est verum, et ubi de Domino, Divinum Verum); "prolongabit dies", significat Divinum Bonum, quod etiam procedet ab Ipso; ("longum" et inde "prolongare" dicitur de bono (videatur supra, n. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_900/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_629" target=_top>629</a> [a]), et "dies" significant status;) "et voluntas Jehovae per manum Ipsius prosperabitur", significat quod sic omnia et singula in caelis et in terris in Divino ordine tenebuntur; "ex labore animae suae", significat per tentationes; "videbit, saturabitur", significat glorificationem: haec per illa verba in sensu supremo, in quo de Domino, significantur; in sensu autem respectivo per eadem describitur salvatio generis humani, pro quo Dominus ex Divino Amore pugnavit.<p>[3] Dicitur, "Si posuerit reatum animam suam", sicut foret dubium quod positurus sit; sed hoc involvit simile quod Ipse dicit apud Johannem,<p>"Ego pono animam meam, ut rursus accipiam illam; nemo tollit eam a Me, sed Ego pono a Me Ipso: potestatem Ego habeo ponendi eam, et potestatem habeo recipiendi eam: hoc praeceptum accepi a Patre meo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_900/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_17" target=_top>10:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_900/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_18" target=_top>18</a>):<p>arcanum quod in his verbis latet, non quisquam videre potest, nisi qui scit quales sunt tentationes, per quas homo regeneratur; homo enim in illis tenetur in suo libero, ex quo apparet illi sicut ex se pugnet; immo in tentationibus est homini liberum spirituale fortius quam extra illas, est enim interius: nisi homo ex eo pugnaret in tentationibus, non poterit spiritualis fieri; omne enim liberum est amoris, quare homo tunc ex amore veri et inde ex amore vitae aeternae pugnat; ita non aliter aperitur internum, et homo regeneratur. Ex his paucis aliquatenus videri potest quid illa verba Domini involvunt, nempe quod ex suo libero pugnaverit, et demum posuerit animam suam, ex causa ut omnia ex propria potentia faceret, et inde ex Semet Ipso Justitia fieret, quod non potuit fieri nisi ex libero Ipsius; inde dicitur, "Ego pono animam a Me Ipso; potestatem habeo ponendi illam, et potestatem habeo recipiendi illam; hoc praeceptum accepi a Patre meo."<p>[4] Qui hoc arcanum non sciunt, illi interpretantur illa verba quemadmodum Ariani, quod non actualis sed adoptivus Filius Dei fuerit; ita quod adoptatus sit quia voluit animam suam ponere, seu mortem crucis subire: non scientes quod illa verba involvant quod ex propria potentia contra inferna ex Humano suo pugnaverit, et illa vicerit, et quod ex propria potentia Humanum suum glorificaverit, hoc est, univerit illud ipsi Divino in Se, et sic illud Divinum fecerit, quod absque absoluto libero relicto Ipsi quoad Humanum nequaquam fieri potuit. Ex his nunc patet cur apud Esaiam dicitur, "Si posuerit reatum animam suam."
