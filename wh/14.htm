<h4 align="center"></h4>
<h4 align="center">十、主就是圣言</h4><p>WH14.圣言的至内在意义唯独论述主，描述祂人身的荣耀，也就是祂与神性本身合一的一切状态，还有祂征服地狱，使那里的一切事物，以及天堂都恢复秩序所处的一切状态（<a href="../ac/2249.htm">2249</a>，<a href="../ac/7014.htm">7014</a>节）。因此，至内在的意义描述了主在世上的整个一生，主通过圣言不断与天使同在（<a href="../ac/2523.htm">2523</a>节）。因此，唯独主在圣言的至内在部分，圣言的神性与神圣来源于此（<a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>，<a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>节）。主说，经上凡指着祂的话都应验了，这句话表示包含在至内在意义中的一切事物都应验了（<a href="../ac/7933.htm">7933</a>节）。</p><p>圣言表示神性真理（<a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>，<a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>，<a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>节）。主就是圣言，因为祂是神性真理（<a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>节）。主是圣言，还因为圣言来自祂，关乎祂（<a href="../ac/2859.htm">2859</a>节），圣言的至内在意义唯独涉及主；因此，主自己就在其中（<a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>，<a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>节）。由于圣言的每一个部分里面都有神性良善和神性真理的婚姻，所以该婚姻唯独在主里面（<a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="../ac/3005.htm">3005</a>，<a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="../ac/4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="../ac/5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="../ac/5502.htm">5502</a>，<a href="../ac/6343.htm">6343</a>，<a href="../ac/7945.htm">7945</a>，<a href="../ac/8339.htm">8339</a>，<a href="../ac/9263.htm">9263</a>，<a href="../ac/9314.htm">9314</a>节）。神性真理是唯一的现实存在，它在来自神性的唯一物质中（<a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>，<a href="../ac/6880.htm">6880</a>，<a href="../ac/7004.htm">7004</a>，<a href="../ac/8200.htm">8200</a>节）。由于从显为天堂太阳的主发出的神性真理是天堂的光，神性良善是天堂的热；由于天堂里的一切事物靠这些存在，正如世上的一切事物靠光和热存在，这些光和热也在它们自己的物质中，并通过它们起作用；又由于自然界通过天堂或灵界存在；所以显然，被造的一切事物都是从神性真理，因而从圣言被造的，正如约翰福音所说的：</p><p>太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神。凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。圣言成了肉身。约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">1:1-3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="../ac/2803.htm"2803</a>，<a href="../ac/2884.htm"2884</a>，<a href="../ac/5272.htm"5272</a>，<a href="../ac/7830.htm"7830</a>节）</p><p>一切事物都是从神性真理，因而从主创造的，关于这一点，详情可参看《天堂与地狱》一书（HH<a href="../hh/137.htm">137</a>节）；这一点在讨论天堂太阳的地方说得更详细，那里说明，这太阳就是主，是祂的神性之爱（HH<a href="../hh/116.htm">116</a>-<a href="../hh/125.htm">125</a>节）；神性真理是光，神性良善是热，二者都来自天堂的太阳（HH<a href="../hh/126.htm">126</a>-<a href="../hh/140.htm">140</a>节）。主与人的结合是通过圣言、凭借它的内义实现的（<a href="../ac/10375.htm">10375</a>节）。这种结合是通过圣言的每一个细节实现的，因此，与其它一切作品相比，圣言是妙不可言的（<a href="../ac/10632.htm">10632</a>-<a href="../ac/10634.htm">10634</a>节）。一旦圣言被写出来，主就通过圣言向人们说话（<a href="../ac/10290.htm">10290</a>节）。另外，关于天堂通过圣言与人的结合，可参看《天堂与地狱》一书（HH<a href="../hh/303.htm">303</a>-<a href="../hh/310.htm">310</a>节）所举的事实。</p>

<h4 align="center">The White Horse (New Century Edition 2020) 14</h4><p>14. <i>The Lord is the Word.</i> The sole subject of the deepest meaning of the Word is the Lord, and it describes all the phases of the glorification of his human nature (that is, of its union with the divine nature itself), as well as all the phases of his taking control of the hells and setting in order everything there and in the heavens: <a href="../ac/2249.htm">2249</a>, <a href="../ac/7014.htm">7014</a>. So in this meaning there is a description of the Lord’s whole life in our world, and by means of this there is a constant presence of the Lord with the angels: <a href="../ac/2523.htm">2523</a>. At the very center of the Word there is only the Lord, and this is the source of what is divine and holy in the Word: <a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>. The Lord’s saying that the Scripture about him was fulfilled [<a href="3927/luke_18_31.htm">Luke 18:31</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">24:44</a>] was referring to everything in the deepest meaning of the Word: <a href="../ac/7933.htm">7933</a>.<p>“The Word” means divine truth: <a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>. The Lord is the Word because he is divine truth: <a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>. The Lord is the Word also because the Word comes from him and is about him (<a href="../ac/2859.htm">2859</a>); and in its deepest meaning is about no one but the Lord, so the Lord himself is there (<a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>); and also because there is a marriage of divine goodness and divine truth throughout the Word and in its every detail, a marriage found only in the Lord (<a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004</a>, <a href="../ac/3005.htm">3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/4137.htm">4137</a>, <a href="../ac/5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="../ac/5502.htm">5502</a>, <a href="../ac/6343.htm">6343</a>, <a href="../ac/7945.htm">7945</a>, <a href="../ac/8339.htm">8339</a>, <a href="../ac/9263.htm">9263</a>, <a href="../ac/9314.htm">9314</a>). Divine truth coming from divine goodness is the sole reality, and only what it dwells in—which comes from what is divine—is substantial: <sup>1</sup><a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/6880.htm">6880</a>, <a href="../ac/7004.htm">7004</a>, <a href="../ac/8200.htm">8200</a>. And because divine truth emanating from the Lord as the sun in heaven is heaven’s light and divine goodness is its warmth, and because everything there comes into being from that light and warmth the way everything in this world comes into being from earthly light and warmth (which are also present in earthly substances and work through them), and because this earthly world as a whole comes into being by means of heaven or the spiritual world, we can see that everything that has been created has been created from divine truth—that is, from the Word, just as it says in John: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things that were made were made through him. And the Word became flesh” (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>): <a href="../ac/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="../ac/2894.htm">2894</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/7678.htm">7678</a>. (See <a href="../hh/137.htm">Heaven and Hell 137</a> for more on the creation of everything by divine truth and therefore by the Lord; §§<a href="../hh/116.htm">116</a>–<a href="../hh/125.htm">125</a> for more about the fact that the sun in heaven is the Lord and that it is his divine love; and §§<a href="../hh/126.htm">126</a>–<a href="../hh/140.htm">140</a> on divine truth being light and divine goodness being warmth, both from that sun in heaven.)<p>A joining together of the Lord and us is accomplished through the Word, by means of its inner meaning: <a href="../ac/10375.htm">10375</a>. Absolutely everything in the Word is a means to this joining together, and this is why the Word is more wondrous than anything else that has been written: <a href="../ac/10632.htm">10632</a>, <a href="../ac/10633.htm">10633</a>, <a href="../ac/10634.htm">10634</a>. Now that the Word has been written, the Lord speaks to us through it: <a href="../ac/10290.htm">10290</a>. (See also the information presented in <a href="../hh/303.htm">Heaven and Hell 303</a>–<a href="../hh/310.htm">310</a> about the union of heaven with us by means of the Word.)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;On the meaning of “substantial” in this passage, see note 1 in <a href="../njhd/263.htm">New Jerusalem 263</a>. [Editors] </p>
<h4 align="center">White Horse (Ryder translation 2007) 14</h4><p>14. The Lord is the Word. <p>In the innermost sense of the Word the only consideration is the Lord Himself, and all the states of the glorification of His human form are described; that is, of His union with the Divine Itself; and all the states in which He was bringing hell into subjection to Himself, imposing order on everything there, and in heaven also: <a href="../ac/2249.htm">2249</a>, <a href="../ac/7014.htm">7014</a>. So, the whole life of the Lord in the world is described in that sense, and through the Word the presence of the Lord with the angels is continuous: <a href="../ac/2523.htm">2523</a>. Therefore the Lord alone is in the innermost part of the Word, and the divinity and sanctity of the Word derive from that: <a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>. The Lord's saying that the Scripture concerning Himself has been fulfilled means the fulfilment of all things in its innermost sense: <a href="../ac/7933.htm">7933</a>. <p>The Word means divine truth: <a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>. The Lord is the Word because He is the divine truth: <a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>. The Lord is also the Word because it comes from Him and is about Him, see <a href="../ac/2859.htm">Arcana Caelestia 2859</a>, and about the Lord alone in the innermost sense, and thus the Lord Himself is there: <a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>. And because in every single part of the Word there is the marriage of divine good and divine truth, that marriage is in the Lord alone: <a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004-3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/4138.htm">4138</a>, <a href="../ac/5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="../ac/5502.htm">5502</a>, <a href="../ac/6343.htm">6343</a>, <a href="../ac/7945.htm">7945</a>, <a href="../ac/8339.htm">8339</a>, <a href="../ac/9263.htm">9263</a>, <a href="../ac/9314.htm">9314</a>. The divine Word is the one and only reality, and that in which it is, which is from what is divine, is the only true essence: <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/6880.htm">6880</a>, <a href="../ac/7004.htm">7004</a>, <a href="../ac/8200.htm">8200</a>. And because the divine truth proceeding from the Lord, as from the sun in heaven, is the light there, and the divine good is the warmth there; and because all things there exist from these, just as everything in the world exists from light and warmth, which are also in their own essential substances and act through them; and because the natural world comes into being through heaven or the spiritual world; it is clear that all things which have been created were created from the divine truth, and so from the Word, according to these words from John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and through it <sup>1</sup>all things were made that were made; and THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH; <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="../ac/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="../ac/2894.htm">2894</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/7850.htm">7850</a>. More about the creation of all things from the divine truth, and thus from the Lord, may be seen in the work <a href="../hh/137.htm">Heaven and Hell 137</a>, and more fully in the section where there is a discussion of the sun in heaven, which is the Lord, and which is His divine love: <a href="../hh/116.htm">116-125</a>. And the divine truth is light, and the divine good is warmth from that same sun in heaven: <a href="../hh/126.htm">126-140</a>. <p>The linking of the Lord with man comes through the Word by means of its internal sense: <a href="../ac/10375.htm">10375</a>. This linking comes about through every single detail of the Word, and for this reason the Word is wonderful compared with everything ever written: <a href="../ac/10632.htm">10632-10634</a>. Once the Word was written, the Lord spoke through it to people: <a href="../ac/10290.htm">10290</a>. In addition there may also be seen ideas raised in the work Heaven and Hell concerning the linking of heaven with people through the Word: <a href="../hh/303.htm">303-310</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Nearly always, if not always, Swedenborg renders <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">John 1:3</a> Omnia per Ipsum' (the Revd John Elliott), rather than the 'per illud' used here. The form ipsum may be either masculine or neuter, enabling through Him as a translation. The current Swedenborg Society editions of De Equo Albo and De Nova Hierosolyma, however, have 'illud' (it, neuter), and that is the form I have translated. </p>
<h4 align="center">White Horse (Willmott translation 1955) 14</h4><p>14. THE LORD IS THE WORD. <p>In the inmost sense of the Word the Lord alone is treated of, and all the states of the glorification of His Human are described; that is, of His union with the Divine Itself; and also all the states involved in the subjugation of the hells, and of the bringing into order of all things therein, as well as in the heavens, (<a href="../ac/2249.htm">2249</a>, <a href="../ac/7014.htm">7014</a>). So that the Lord's whole life in the world is described in that sense, and by means of that sense the Lord's presence with the angels is continuous, (<a href="../ac/2523.htm">2523</a>). Accordingly in the inmost of the Word there is the Lord alone, and the Divinity and holiness of the Word have their origin thence, (<a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>). The Lord's saying that the Scripture concerning Himself was fulfilled, means that all things contained in the inmost sense were fulfilled, (<a href="../ac/7933.htm">7933</a>). <p>The Word means the Divine Truth, (<a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>). The Lord is the Word because He is the Divine Truth, (<a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>). The Lord is also the Word because the Word is from Him, and concerning Him, (<a href="../ac/2859.htm">2859</a>), and in its inmost sense concerning the Lord alone; thus the Lord Himself is therein, (<a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>); and because in each and all things of the Word there is the marriage of Divine Good and Divine Truth, which marriage is in the Lord alone, (<a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004</a>, <a href="../ac/3005.htm">3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/4137.htm">4137</a>, <a href="../ac/5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="../ac/5502.htm">5502</a>, <a href="../ac/6343.htm">6343</a>, <a href="../ac/7945.htm">7945</a>, <a href="../ac/8339.htm">8339</a>, <a href="../ac/9263.htm">9263</a>, <a href="../ac/9314.htm">9314</a>), [<a href="../ac/5138.htm">5138</a>]. Divine Truth is the sole Reality, and that in which it is, which is from the Divine, is the sole Substantiality, (<a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/6880.htm">6880</a>, <a href="../ac/7004.htm">7004</a>, <a href="../ac/8200.htm">8200</a>). Since the Divine Truth, proceeding from the Lord as the Sun in heaven, is light there, and the Divine Good is heat there; and because all things therein come into being from these, just as all things in the world come into being from light and heat, which are also in their own substances, and act by means of them; and because the natural world exists by means of heaven or the spiritual world; it is clear that all things which were created, were created from the Divine Truth and thus from the Word, according to these words in John, <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and by it were all things made that were made; and THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH. <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>(<a href="../ac/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="../ac/2894.htm">2894</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/6880.htm">6880</a>). Further particulars concerning the creation of all things from Divine Truth, thus by the Lord, may be seen in <a href="../hh/137.htm">137</a>; and more fully in the passage concerning the Sun in heaven, where it is shown that it is the Lord, and that it is His Divine Love, (<a href="../hh/116.htm">116-125</a>); and that Divine Truth is the light, and Divine Good is the heat from that Sun in heaven, (<a href="../hh/126.htm">126-140</a>). <p>The Lord's conjunction with man is through the Word, by means of the internal sense, (<a href="../ac/10375.htm">10375</a>). Each and all things of the Word effect this conjunction, and hence the Word is wonderful beyond comparison with every other writing, (<a href="../ac/10632.htm">10632</a>, <a href="../ac/10633.htm">10633</a>, <a href="../ac/10634.htm">10634</a>). Since the writing of the Word it is by this means that the Lord speaks with men, (<a href="../ac/10290.htm">10290</a>). See, in addition, the facts adduced in the work on Heaven and Hell, concerning the conjunction of heaven with man by means of the Word, (<a href="../hh/303.htm">303-310</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">White Horse (Whitehead translation 1892) 14</h4><p>14. The Lord is the Word. The Word in its inmost sense treats solely of the Lord, describing all the states of the glorification of His Human, that is, of its union with the Divine itself, and likewise all the states of the subjugation of the hells, and the reducing to order of all things therein, and in the heavens (<a href="../ac/2249.htm">2249</a>, <a href="../ac/7014.htm">7014</a>). Thus the inmost sense describes the Lord's whole life in the world, and thereby the Lord is continually present with the angels (<a href="../ac/2523.htm">2523</a>).

The Lord's saying, that the Scripture was fulfilled concerning Him, signifies, that all things were fulfilled which are contained in the inmost sense (<a href="../ac/7933.htm">7933</a>). <p>The Word signifies the Divine truth (<a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>).

And because it treats of the Lord alone in its inmost sense; thus the Lord Himself is therein (<a href="../ac/1873.htm">1873</a>, <a href="../ac/9357.htm">9357</a>). And because in each and all things of the Word there is a marriage of the Divine good and the Divine truth, which marriage is in the Lord alone (<a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004, 3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/4158.htm">4158</a>, <a href="../ac/5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="../ac/5502.htm">5502</a>, <a href="../ac/6343.htm">6343</a>, <a href="../ac/7945.htm">7945</a>, <a href="../ac/8339.htm">8339</a>, <a href="../ac/9263.htm">9263</a>, <a href="../ac/9314.htm">9314</a>).

And because the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as the sun in heaven is light there, and the Divine good is heat there; and inasmuch as all things in heaven derive their existence therefrom, as all things in the world derive their existence from light and heat, which are also in their own substances, and act by means thereof; and inasmuch as the natural world exists by means of heaven or the spiritual world; it is plain that all things which were created <sup>1</sup>were created from the Divine truth, thus from the Word, according to these words in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word, and by it all things were made that were made; and the Word was made flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="../ac/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="../ac/2884.htm">2884</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/7830.htm">7830</a>). <p>Further particulars concerning the creation of all things from the Divine truth, consequently by the Lord, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (<a href="../hh/137.htm">137</a>); and more fully in the article concerning the Sun in Heaven, where it is shown that the Lord is that Sun, and that it is His Divine love (<a href="../hh/116.htm">116-125</a>). And that the Divine truth is Light, and the Divine good is Heat, proceeding from that sun in heaven (<a href="../hh/126.htm">126-140</a>). <p>The conjunction of the Lord with man is effected by the Word, by means of the internal sense (<a href="../ac/10375.htm">10375</a>). This conjunction is effected by each and all things of the Word, and herein the Word is more wonderful than all other writings (<a href="../ac/10632.htm">10632-10634</a>). Since the time of writing the Word, the Lord thereby speaks with men (<a href="../ac/10290.htm">10290</a>). For further particulars respecting the Conjunction of Heaven with man by means of the Word, see the work on Heaven and Hell (<a href="../hh/303.htm">303-310</a>). <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The phrase "which were created" is omitted by the translator, but appears in the Latin. </p>
