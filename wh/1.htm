<h4 align="center"></h4>
<h4 align="center">一、启示录19章提到的白马</h4><p>WH1.在启示录19章，约翰用这些话来描述圣言的灵义或内义：</p><p>我看见天开了。见有一匹白马，骑在马上的称为忠信真实，祂审判、争战都按着公义。祂的眼睛如火焰，祂头上戴着许多冠冕，又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道。祂穿着溅了血的衣服，祂的名称为神的圣言。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着，万王之王，万主之主。启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11-14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>若不通过内义，没有人能知道这些话的每个细节表示什么。显然，每句话都在某个方面具有代表性和意义，如：“天开了”；有一匹“白马”；“骑在马上的”；“祂审判、争战都按着公义”；“祂的眼睛如火焰”；“祂头上戴着许多冠冕”；“祂有除了祂自己没有人知道的名字”；“祂穿着溅了血的衣服”；“天上的众军骑着白马跟随祂”；“他们穿着细麻衣、又白又洁”；“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着”。经上公开声明：此处描述的是“圣言”（即道），主就是圣言；因为经上说“祂的名称为神的圣言”；然后又说“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着，万王之王，万主之主”。从每句话的含义明显可知，这段经文描述的是灵义或内义上的圣言。“天开了”代表并表示圣言的内义在天堂被看到，并由此被那些天堂向自己打开的世人看到。“白马”代表并表示对圣言内在事物的理解；稍后会说明，这就是“白马”的含义。“骑在马上的”是指圣言方面的主，因而是指圣言，这是显而易见的，因为经上说“祂的名称为神的圣言”；神凭良善而被称为“忠信并按着公义审判”；凭真理而被称为“真实并按着公义争战”；因为主自己就是公义。“祂的眼睛如火焰”表示来自其神性之爱的神性良善的神性真理。“祂头上戴着许多冠冕”表示信之一切良善与真理。“又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道”表示除了祂自己和祂所揭示给的人外，没有人知道圣言在内义上具有这种性质。“祂穿着溅了血的衣服”表示被施暴的字面上的圣言。“天上的众军骑着白马跟随祂”表示那些理解圣言内层的人。“他们穿着细麻衣、又白又洁”表示这些人处于源于良善的真理。“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着”表示真理和良善，以及它们的品质。从这些细节，以及上下文明显可知，此处预言了圣言的灵义或内义将在教会末期被揭开；那里启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.17.htm">19:17-21</a>）还描述了届时将要发生的事。没有必要在此证明这些话表示这类事物，因为它们在《属天的奥秘》一书有详细的解释，那里说明：主就是圣言，因为祂是神性真理（<a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>，<a href="../ac/2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="../ac/2894.htm">2894</a>，<a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>，<a href="../ac/8535.htm">8535</a>节）。圣言是神性真理（<a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>，<a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>，<a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>节）。由于主是公义，所以经上说“骑在马上的审判、争战，都按着公义”；主因祂凭自己的能力拯救人类而被称为“公义”（<a href="../ac/1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="../ac/2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="../ac/2026.htm">2026</a>，<a

href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>，<a href="../ac/9979.htm">9979</a>节）。“祂的眼睛如火焰”表示来自神性之爱的神性良善的神性真理，这是因为“眼睛”表示理解力和信之真理（<a href="../ac/2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="../ac/4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="../ac/4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="../ac/4534.htm">4534</a>，<a href="../ac/6923.htm">6923</a>，<a href="../ac/9051.htm">9051</a>，<a href="../ac/10569.htm">10569</a>节）；“火焰”表示爱之良善（<a href="../ac/934.htm">934</a>，<a href="../ac/4906.htm">4906</a>，<a href="../ac/5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="../ac/6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="../ac/6832.htm">6832</a>节）。“祂头上戴着许多冠冕”表示信之一切良善与真理（<a href="../ac/114.htm">114</a>，<a href="../ac/3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="../ac/6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="../ac/6640.htm">6640</a>，<a

href="../ac/9905.htm">9905</a>节）。“又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道”表示除了祂自己和祂所揭示给的人外，没有人看到圣言在内义上具有这种性质；这是因为“名”表示事物的性质（<a href="../ac/144.htm">144</a>，<a href="../ac/145.htm">145</a>，<a href="../ac/1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="../ac/1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="../ac/2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="../ac/2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="../ac/3006.htm">3006</a>，<a

href="../ac/1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="../ac/2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>，<a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>，<a href="../ac/5954.htm">5954</a>，<a

href="../ac/6918.htm">6918</a>，<a href="../ac/9158.htm">9158</a>，<a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>节）；因为“血”表示通过虚假对真理所施的暴行（<a href="../ac/374.htm">374</a>，<a href="../ac/1005.htm">1005</a>，<a href="../ac/4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="../ac/5476.htm">5476</a>，<a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>节）。“骑着白马跟随祂的天上众军”表示那些理解圣言内层的人，这是因为“众军”表示那些处于天堂和教会的真理和良善之人（<a href="../ac/3448.htm">3448</a>，<a href="../ac/7236.htm">7236</a>，<a href="../ac/7988.htm">7988</a>，<a href="../ac/8019.htm">8019</a>节）；“马”表示理解力（<a href="../ac/3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="../ac/6125.htm">6125</a>，<a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>，<a href="../ac/6531.htm">6531</a>，<a href="../ac/6534.htm">6534</a>，<a href="../ac/7024.htm">7024</a>，<a href="../ac/8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="../ac/8381.htm">8381</a>节）；“白”表示在天堂之光中的真理，因而表示内层真理（<a href="../ac/3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="../ac/3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="../ac/4007.htm">4007</a>，<a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>节）。“穿着细麻衣，又白又洁”表示这些人处于源于良善的真理，这是因为“细麻”或“麻”表示来自一个属天源头的真理，也就是源于良善的真理（<a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>，<a href="../ac/9469.htm">9469</a>节）。“在衣服和大腿上有名写着”表示真理和良善，以及它们的品质，这是因为如前所述，“衣服”表示真理，“名”表示事物的性质，“大腿”表示爱之良善（<a href="../ac/3021.htm">3021</a>，<a href="../ac/4277.htm">4277</a>，<a href="../ac/4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="../ac/9961.htm">9961</a>，<a href="../ac/10488.htm">10488</a>节）。“万王之王，万主之主”是指神性真理和神性良善方面的主；主因其神性真理而被称为“王”（<a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="../ac/5068.htm">5068</a>，<a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>节）；因其神性良善而被称为“主”（<a href="../ac/4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="../ac/9167.htm">9167</a>，<a href="../ac/9194.htm">9194</a>节）。由此明显可知，圣言在灵义或内义上是何性质，其中没有一句话不表示与天堂和教会有关的某种属灵事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">The White Horse (New Century Edition 2020) 1</h4><p>1. IN the Book of Revelation, this is how John describes the Word <sup>1</sup>in regard to its spiritual or inner meaning <sup>2</sup>:<p>"I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And the one who sat on it was called faithful and true, and with justice he judges and makes war. His eyes were a flame of fire, and on his head were many gems. He had a name written that no one knew except him. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. The armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed him on white horses. He has on his robe and on his thigh a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords." (<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">16</a>)<p>Only from the inner meaning can anyone know what these particular details involve. It is obvious that each one represents and means something — the heaven that is opened; the horse that is white; the one who sat on it; his judging and making war justly; his eyes being a flame of fire; his having many gems on his head; his having a name that no one knew except him; his being clothed with a robe dipped in blood; the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, following him on white horses; and his having a name written on his robe and on his thigh. It says plainly that this is the Word and that it is the Lord <sup>3</sup>who is the Word, since it says “his name is called the Word of God” and then says “he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.”<p>[2] If we interpret the individual words, we can see that this is describing the spiritual or inner meaning of the Word. Heaven being opened represents and means that the inner meaning of the Word is seen in heaven and therefore is seen by people in this world to whom heaven has been opened. <sup>4</sup>The horse that is white represents and means an understanding of the Word in regard to its deeper contents (the reason for this meaning of the white horse will become clear in what follows). Unquestionably, the one who sat on the horse is the Lord as the Word and is therefore the Word, since it says “his name is called the Word of God.” He is described as faithful and judging justly because he is good, and he is described as true and making war justly because he is true, since the Lord himself is justice. His eyes being a flame of fire means the divine truth that comes from the divine goodness of his divine love. His having many gems on his head means all the types of goodness and truth that belong to faith. His having a name written that no one knew except him means that what the Word is like in its inner meaning is seen by no one except him and those to whom he reveals it. His being clothed with a robe dipped in blood means the Word in its literal meaning, which has suffered violence. The armies in heaven that followed him on white horses mean the people who have an understanding of the deeper contents of the Word. Their being clothed in fine linen, white and clean, means that these people have an awareness of truth that comes from doing good. His having a name written on his robe and on his thigh means what is true and what is good, and what that truth and goodness are like.<p>[3] We can see from this and from what precedes and follows [this passage in the Word] that we have here a prediction that around the last time of the church <sup>5</sup>the spiritual or inner meaning of the Word will be opened. What will happen then is described in verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_21.htm">21</a>.<p>There is no need to demonstrate here that this is the meaning of these words, since the details have been explained in Secrets of Heaven <sup>6</sup>as follows:<p>The Lord is the Word because he is divine truth: <a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>, <a href="../ac/2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="../ac/2894.htm">2894</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/8535.htm">8535</a>. The Word is divine truth: <a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>. It says that the one who sat on the horse judges and makes war justly because the Lord is justice; the Lord is called “justice” because he saved the human race by his own power: <a href="../ac/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="../ac/2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="../ac/2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="../ac/2027.htm">2027</a>, <a href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="../ac/10019.htm">10019</a>, <a href="../ac/10152.htm">10152</a>. Justice is a form of merit that belongs to the Lord alone: <a href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="../ac/9979.htm">9979</a>. His eyes being a flame of fire means divine truth that comes from the divine goodness of his divine love, because eyes mean understanding and mean the truth that belongs to faith: <a href="../ac/2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403</a>–<a href="../ac/4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="../ac/4523.htm">4523</a>–<a href="../ac/4534.htm">4534</a>, <a href="../ac/6923.htm">6923</a>, <a href="../ac/9051.htm">9051</a>, <a href="../ac/10569.htm">10569</a>; and a flame of fire means the goodness of love: <a href="../ac/934.htm">934</a>, <a href="../ac/4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="../ac/5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="../ac/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="../ac/6832.htm">6832</a>. The gems on his head mean all the types of goodness and truth that belong to faith: <a href="../ac/114.htm">114</a>, <a href="../ac/3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="../ac/6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="../ac/6640.htm">6640</a>, <a href="../ac/9863.htm">9863</a>, <a href="../ac/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="../ac/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="../ac/9873.htm">9873</a>, <a href="../ac/9905.htm">9905</a>. His having a name written that no one knew except him means that no one sees what the Word is like in its inner meaning except him and those to whom he reveals it, because the name means what the named thing is really like: <a href="../ac/144.htm">144</a>, <a href="../ac/145.htm">145</a>, <a href="../ac/1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="../ac/1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="../ac/2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="../ac/2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="../ac/3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="../ac/3237.htm">3237</a>, <a href="../ac/3421.htm">3421</a>, <a href="../ac/6674.htm">6674</a>, <a href="../ac/9310.htm">9310</a>. His being clothed with a robe dipped in blood means the Word in its literal meaning, which has suffered violence, because a garment means truth since truth clothes what is good: <a href="../ac/1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="../ac/2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="../ac/5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="../ac/9216.htm">9216</a>, <a href="../ac/9952.htm">9952</a>, <a href="../ac/10536.htm">10536</a> (and this has particular reference to the most external forms of truth and therefore to the Word in its letter: <a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="../ac/6918.htm">6918</a>, <a href="../ac/9158.htm">9158</a>, <a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>); and because blood means the violence inflicted on what is true by what is false: <a href="../ac/374.htm">374</a>, <a href="../ac/1005.htm">1005</a>, <a href="../ac/4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="../ac/5476.htm">5476</a>, <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>. The armies in heaven that followed him on white horses mean the people who have an understanding of the deeper contents of the Word, because armies mean people who have the understanding of truth and the love for doing good that are characteristic of heaven and the church: <a href="../ac/3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="../ac/7236.htm">7236</a>, <a href="../ac/7988.htm">7988</a>, <a href="../ac/8019.htm">8019</a>; a horse means understanding: <a href="../ac/3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="../ac/6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>, <a href="../ac/6534.htm">6534</a>, <a href="../ac/6534.htm">6534</a>, <a href="../ac/7024.htm">7024</a>, <a href="../ac/8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="../ac/8381.htm">8381</a>; and white means truth that is in heaven’s light <sup>7</sup>and therefore means deeper truth: <a href="../ac/3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="../ac/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="../ac/4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>. Their being clothed in fine linen, white and clean, means that these people have an awareness of truth that comes from doing good, because linen or fine linen means truth of a heavenly origin, which is truth arising from what is good: <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="../ac/9469.htm">9469</a>. His having a name written on his robe and on his thigh means what is true and what is good, and what that truth and goodness are like, because a robe means what is true and a name means what that truth is like (as noted above), and the thigh means goodness that comes from love: <a href="../ac/3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="../ac/4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="../ac/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="../ac/9961.htm">9961</a>, <a href="../ac/10488.htm">10488</a>. King of Kings and Lord of Lords is the Lord in respect to divine truth and in respect to divine goodness. The Lord is called “King” because of his divine truth: <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/5068.htm">5068</a>, <a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>. He is called “Lord” because of his divine goodness: <a href="../ac/4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="../ac/9167.htm">9167</a>, <a href="../ac/9194.htm">9194</a>.<p>We can see from this what the Word is like in its spiritual or inner meaning and that there is not a word in it that does not mean something spiritual, something about heaven and the church.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;On Swedenborg’s use of the term “the Word” for biblical material, see note 7 in <a href="../njhd/1.htm">New Jerusalem 1</a>, as well as his list of books contained in the Word in <a href="16.htm">White Horse 16</a>. [Editors]<p>2.&nbsp;On the use of the terms “spiritual meaning” and “inner meaning” in Swedenborg’s exegesis of the Bible, see White Horse 9, and also note 1 in <a href="../njhd/107.htm">New Jerusalem 107</a>. See also the fuller description of inner meaning in the later part of note 7 in <a href="../njhd/1.htm">New Jerusalem 1</a>. [Editors]<p>3.&nbsp;On Swedenborg’s use of the term “the Lord” to refer to Jesus Christ as God, see note 10 in <a href="../njhd/1.htm">New Jerusalem 1</a>. [Editors]<p>4.&nbsp;In Swedenborg’s usage, the notion of heaven’s being open to an individual has two distinct but nonexclusive meanings. It can be applied to those who have had their spiritual senses opened so that they can actually see and hear what takes place in heaven. It can also be applied to “people who love and therefore believe in the Lord” (<a href="../ac/2760.htm">Secrets of Heaven 2760:2</a>), and more generally to “people who devote themselves to the goodness and truth that come from [heaven]” (<a href="../ac/2851.htm">Secrets of Heaven 2851:2</a>). To put the latter meaning more simply, heaven is opened to those who are living spiritually rather than materialistically. In the present passage, the latter meaning seems to be intended more than the former, though the former is not excluded.

<h4 align="center">White Horse (Ryder translation 2007) 1</h4><p>1. CONCERNING THE WHITE HORSE as described in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 19.<p>In the writings of John, in the Book of Revelation, the following is a description of the Word in its spiritual sense, in other words the sense contained within it, or its 'inner meaning:' <p>I saw heaven standing open, and behold, a White Horse. And the one sitting on the White Horse was called faithful and true, judging and fighting in righteousness. His eyes were a flame of fire, and on His head were many jewels. He had a name inscribed that no one knew but He Himself. And He was dressed in a garment dyed with blood, and His name is called the Word of God. The armies that followed Him in heaven were on white horses, they themselves dressed in clean white linen. On His garment and on His thigh was written a name, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">16</a>. <p>No one can have a clear idea of what each of the details in this description entails except by way of its 'inner meaning." It is obvious that each particular detail must represent or signify something, as follows: <p>Heaven which was standing open; a horse which was white; the one seated on it was called faithful and true, <sup>1</sup>judging and fighting in righteousness; His eyes a flame of fire; and many jewels <sup>2</sup>on His head; having a name inscribed that no one knew but He Himself; and dressed in a garment dyed with blood; and the armies that followed Him in heaven were on white horses, they themselves dressed in clean white linen; <sup>3</sup>on His garment and on His thigh He has written a name. <p>It is stated plainly that the one seated on the White Horse is the Word, and He is the Lord who is the Word, for what is said is that His name is called The Word of God; and then, He has written on His garment and on His thigh the title King of Kings and Lord of Lords. <p>From the interpretation of each individual phrase or statement it is clear that all this serves to describe the spiritual sense or internal meaning of the Word. The phrase heaven which was standing open' represents and signifies that the inner meaning of the Word is seen by those in heaven, and consequently also by those on earth for whom heaven stands open. 'A horse which was white' represents and signifies an understanding of the Word as regards its inner meanings. <sup>4</sup>That the 'white horse' means what I have said will be clear from what follows. <p>It is clear that 'the one seated on it' means the Lord in His capacity as the Word, and thus means the Word itself, for it is stated that 'His name is called the Word of God;' and he is called 'faithful' and 'judging in righteousness' because of His goodness; and 'true' and 'fighting in righteousness' because of His truth, for the Lord Himself is righteousness. 'His eyes a flame of fire' signify divine truth radiating from the divine good flowing from His divine love. The 'many jewels on His head' signify all the good and true properties of faith. Having a 'name written which no one knew other than He Himself' signifies that no one sees what is the nature of the Word in its inner meaning except Himself, and one to whom He reveals it. <p>Dressed in a garment dyed with blood' signifies the violence done to the Word in its literal meaning. <sup>5</sup>'The armies in heaven which followed Him on white horses' signifies those who understand the Word as regards its inner meanings.' 'Those dressed in clean white linen' signifies the same people who are endued with truth arising from what is good. 'On His garment and on His thigh a name written <sup>6</sup>' signifies what is true and what is good and their specific qualities. <p>From all these verses, and from those which come before and after them, it is clear that they serve to foretell that the spiritual or internal sense of the Word will be laid open at around the final time of the Church; and what will happen at that time is also described there, <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-21</a>.

<h4 align="center">White Horse (Willmott translation 1955) 1</h4><p>1. CONCERNING THE WHITE HORSE in THE APOCALYPSE Chapter 19<p>The Word as to its spiritual or internal sense is described by John in Revelation in these words: <p>I saw heaven opened; and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in justice [A.V. righteousness] He doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns; and He had a name written, that no man knew, but He Himself. And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and His name is called THE WORD OF GOD. And the armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">16</a>. <p>It is not possible for any one to have a clear idea of what each of these particular things implies, except from the internal sense. It is clear that each single thing is something representative and significative as heaven being opened; a horse which was white; He that sat upon him, in justice judging and making war; His eyes being as a flame of fire; many crowns being on his head; that He had a name that no man knew but He Himself; His being clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and that the armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white horses; that they were clothed in fine linen, white and clean; and that on His vesture and on His thigh He had a name written. It is stated openly that He is the Word, and that it is the Lord Who is THE WORD; for it is said, "His name is called THE WORD OF GOD," and later, "He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." From the meaning of each particular expression, it is evident that in this passage the Word is described as to its spiritual or internal sense. Heaven being opened represents and signifies that the internal sense of the Word can be seen in heaven and thence by those in the world to whom heaven is opened. The horse which was white represents and signifies the understanding of the Word as to interior things. It will be evident from what follows that this is the meaning of a white horse. That He that sat upon him is the Lord as to the Word, and thus the Word, is established, for it is stated, "His name is called the Word of God." He is called Faithful, and is said to judge in justice, from Good. And He is called True, and is said to make war in justice, from Truth, for the Lord Himself is justice. His eyes being as a flame of fire denote the Divine Truth from the Divine Good of His Divine Love. The many crowns upon His head signify all goods and truths of faith. His having a Name written that no man knew but He Himself, means that no one but Himself, and he to whom He reveals it, sees that the Word is of such a quality in the internal sense. Clothed in a vesture dipped in blood signifies the Word in the letter to which violence has been offered. The armies in the heavens which followed Him upon white horses denote those who are in the understanding of the Word as to its interiors. Clothed in fine linen clean and white signifies the same persons in truth from good. A Name written on His vesture and on His thigh signifies truth and good and their quality. From these things, as from those which precede and those which follow, it is evident that therein it is foretold, that about the last time of the Church the spiritual or internal sense of the Word will be disclosed. And what will come to pass at that time is even described there, in <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-21</a>.<p>It is unnecessary to show here that such things are signified by these words, seeing that they are shown in detail in Arcana Coelestia, as for example that: The Lord is the Word because He is the Divine Truth, (<a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>, <a href="../ac/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="../ac/2894.htm">2894</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/7835.htm">7835</a>): The Word is Divine Truth, (<a href="../ac/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="../ac/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="../ac/9987.htm">9987</a>). He is described as sitting upon the horse, judging and making war in justice, because the Lord is Justice; the Lord is called Justice by reason of His having of His own proper power saved the human race, (<a href="../ac/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="../ac/2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="../ac/2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="../ac/2027.htm">2027</a>, <a href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="../ac/10019.htm">10019</a>, <a href="../ac/10152.htm">10152</a>). And justice is merit which belongs to the Lord alone, (<a href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="../ac/9979.htm">9979</a>). His eyes as a flame of fire signify Divine Truth from the Divine Good of the Divine Love; this is because eyes signify the understanding and the truth of faith, (<a href="../ac/2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403-4421</a>, <a href="../ac/4523.htm">4523-4534</a>, <a href="../ac/6923.htm">6923</a>, <a href="../ac/9051.htm">9051</a>, <a href="../ac/10569.htm">10569</a>), and a flame of fire, the good of love, (<a href="../ac/934.htm">934</a>, <a href="../ac/4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="../ac/5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="../ac/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="../ac/6832.htm">6832</a>).

His having a Name written which no man knew but He Himself, means that no one but He Himself, and he to whom He reveals it, sees that the Word is of such a quality in the internal sense; this is because a name denotes a thing's quality, (<a href="../ac/144.htm">144-145</a>, <a href="../ac/1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="../ac/1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="../ac/2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="../ac/2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="../ac/3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="../ac/3237.htm">3237</a>, <a href="../ac/3421.htm">3421</a>, <a href="../ac/6674.htm">6674</a>, <a href="../ac/9310.htm">9310</a>). Being clothed in a vesture dipped in blood, signifies the Word in the letter to which violence has been done this is because vesture means truth, since truth clothes what is good, (<a href="../ac/1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="../ac/2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="../ac/5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="../ac/9216.htm">9216</a>, <a href="../ac/9952.htm">9952</a>, <a href="../ac/10536.htm">10536</a>), especially truth in its most external form, and so the Word in the letter, (<a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="../ac/6918.htm">6918</a>, <a href="../ac/9158.htm">9158</a>, <a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>) and because blood means the violence done to truth by what is false, (<a href="../ac/374.htm">374</a>, <a href="../ac/1005.htm">1005</a>, <a href="../ac/4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="../ac/5476.htm">5476</a>, <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>). The armies in the heavens which followed Him on white horses signify those who are in the understanding of the Word as to its interiors: this is because armies signify those who are in the truths and goods of heaven and the Church, (<a href="../ac/3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="../ac/7236.htm">7236</a>, <a href="../ac/7988.htm">7988</a>, <a href="../ac/8019.htm">8019</a>) and a horse signifies the understanding, (<a href="../ac/3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="../ac/6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>, <a href="../ac/6531.htm">6531</a>, <a href="../ac/6534.htm">6534</a>, <a href="../ac/7024.htm">7024</a>, <a href="../ac/8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="../ac/8381.htm">8381</a>); and white means truth which is in the light of heaven, thus interior truth, (<a href="../ac/3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="../ac/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="../ac/4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>). It is because linen or fine linen signifies truth from a celestial origin, which is truth from good, that being clothed in fine linen white and clean means these same persons in truth from good, (<a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="../ac/9469.htm">9469</a>). That a Name written on the vesture and on the thigh, means truth and good, and their quality, is because vesture means truth, and a name means quality, as above, and thigh signifies the good of love, (<a href="../ac/3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="../ac/4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="../ac/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="../ac/9961.htm">9961</a>, <a href="../ac/10488.htm">10488</a>). King of kings and Lord of lords is the Lord as to Divine Truth and as to Divine Good. The Lord is called King from Divine Truth, (<a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/5068.htm">5068</a>, <a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>), and He is called Lord from Divine Good, (<a href="../ac/4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="../ac/9167.htm">9167</a>, <a href="../ac/9194.htm">9194</a>). From these things the quality of the Word in its spiritual or internal sense is manifest, and that there is not a word in it that does not mean something spiritual relating to heaven and the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">White Horse (Whitehead translation 1892) 1</h4><p>1. THE WHITE HORSE mentioned in THE APOCALYPSE CHAPTER 19 <p>In the Apocalypse of John the Word is thus described as to its spiritual or internal sense: <p>I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in justice He doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire; and upon His head were many diadems; and He hath a name written that no one knew but He Himself. And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God. And the armies which were in the heavens followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean. And He hath upon His vesture and upon His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords (<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">19:11-14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">16</a>). <p>No one can know what each of these expressions involves, except from the internal sense. It is manifest that every expression is in some respect representative and significative: as when it is said, that "heaven was opened;" that there was "a white horse;" that "there was One sitting upon him;" that "in justice He doth judge and make war;" that "His eyes were as a flame of fire;" that "on His head were many diadems;" that "He had a name that no man knew but He Himself;" that "He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood;" that "the armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white horses;" that "they were clothed in fine linen white and clean;" and that "on His vesture and on His thigh He had a name written." It is expressly said, that it is "the Word" which is here described, and the Lord who is the Word; for it is said, "His name is called the Word of God;" and afterwards, "He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords." From the interpretation of each expression it evidently appears, that the Word is here described as to its spiritual or internal sense. By "heaven being opened" is represented and signified, that the internal sense of the Word is seen in heaven, and thence by those in the world to whom heaven is opened. "The horse," which was white, represents and signifies the understanding of the Word as to its interiors; that this is the signification of "a white horse," will be shown presently. That "He that sat upon him" is the Lord as to the Word, thus the Word, is manifest, for it is said, "His name is called the Word of God;" who, from good, is called "faithful and judging in justice;" and from truth, is called "true, and who maketh war in justice;" for the Lord Himself is justice. "His eyes, as a flame of fire," signify the Divine truth, from the Divine good of His Divine love. "The many diadems upon His head," signify all the goods and truths of faith. "Having a name written that no one knew but He Himself," signifies that the quality of the Word in the internal sense is seen by no one but Himself, and those to whom He reveals it. "Clothed in a vesture dipped in blood," signifies the Word in the letter, to which violence has been offered. "The armies in the heavens which followed Him upon white horses," signify those who are in the understanding of the Word as to its interiors. "Clothed in fine linen, white and clean," signify the same persons in truth from good. "Upon His vesture and upon his thigh a name written" signifies truth and good, and their quality. From these particulars, and from those which precede and follow in that chapter, it is evident, that therein is predicted, that about the last time of the church the spiritual or internal sense of the Word would be opened; but what would come to pass at that time, is also described there (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">17-21</a>). That this is the signification of the words mentioned, it is unnecessary to prove in this place, as they are particularly explained in The Arcana Coelestia; where it is shown, That the Lord is the Word, because He is the Divine truth (<a href="../ac/2533.htm">2533</a>, <a href="../ac/2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="../ac/2884.htm">2884</a>, <a href="../ac/5272.htm">5272</a>, <a href="../ac/7835.htm">7835</a>).

That because the Lord is justice, therefore it is said, that "He who sat upon the horse in justice doth judge and make war;" and that the Lord is called "justice" for this reason, because of His own power He has saved the human race (<a href="../ac/1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="../ac/2025.htm">2025-2027</a>, <a href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="../ac/10019.htm">10019</a>, <a href="../ac/10152.htm">10152</a>). And that "justice" is the merit which belongs to the Lord alone (<a href="../ac/9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="../ac/9979.htm">9979</a>). That "His eyes, as a flame of fire," signify the Divine truth from the Divine good of the Divine love, is, because "the eyes" signify the understanding and the truth of faith (<a href="../ac/2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="../ac/4403.htm">4403-4421</a>, <a href="../ac/4523.htm">4523-4534</a>, <a href="../ac/6923.htm">6923</a>, <a href="../ac/9051.htm">9051</a>, <a href="../ac/10569.htm">10569</a>); and "a flame of fire" signifies the good of love (<a href="../ac/934.htm">934</a>, <a href="../ac/4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="../ac/5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="../ac/6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="../ac/6832.htm">6832</a>). That "the diadems which were upon His head" signify all the goods and truths of faith (<a href="../ac/114.htm">114</a>, <a href="../ac/3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="../ac/6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="../ac/6640.htm">6640</a>, <a href="../ac/9863.htm">9863</a>, <a href="../ac/9865.htm">9865</a>, <a href="../ac/9868.htm">9868</a>, <a href="../ac/9873.htm">9873</a>, <a href="../ac/9905.htm">9905</a>). That "He hath a name written which no one knew but He Himself," signifies that the quality of the Word in the internal sense is seen by no one but Himself, and those to whom He reveals it, is because "a name" signifies the quality of a thing (<a href="../ac/144.htm">144, 145</a>, <a href="../ac/1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="../ac/1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="../ac/2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="../ac/2724.htm">2724[1-3]</a>, <a href="../ac/3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="../ac/3237.htm">3237</a>, <a href="../ac/3421.htm">3421</a>, <a href="../ac/6674.htm">6674</a>, <a href="../ac/9310.htm">9310</a>). That "clothed in a vesture dipped in blood," signifies the Word in the letter, to which violence has been offered, is because "a vesture" signifies truth because it clothes good (<a href="../ac/1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="../ac/2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="../ac/5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="../ac/9216.htm">9216</a>, <a href="../ac/9952.htm">9952</a>, <a href="../ac/10536.htm">10536</a>); especially truth in the ultimates, thus the Word in the letter (<a href="../ac/5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="../ac/6918.htm">6918</a>, <a href="../ac/9158.htm">9158</a>, <a href="../ac/9212.htm">9212</a>); and because "blood" signifies violence offered to truth by falsity (<a href="../ac/374.htm">374</a>, <a href="../ac/1005.htm">1005</a>, <a href="../ac/4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="../ac/5476.htm">5476</a>, <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>). That "the armies in heaven followed Him upon white horses," signify those who are in the understanding of the Word as to its interiors, is because "armies" signify those who are in the truths and goods of heaven and the church (<a href="../ac/3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="../ac/7236.htm">7236</a>, <a href="../ac/7988.htm">7988</a>, <a href="../ac/8019.htm">8019</a>). And "a horse" signifies the understanding (<a href="../ac/3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="../ac/6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>, <a href="../ac/6531.htm">6531</a>, <a href="../ac/6534.htm">6534</a>, <a href="../ac/7024.htm">7024</a>, <a href="../ac/8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="../ac/8318.htm">8318</a>). And "white" signifies truth which is in the light of heaven, consequently interior truth (<a href="../ac/3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="../ac/3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="../ac/4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>). That "clothed in fine linen white and clean," signifies the same persons in truth from good, is because "fine linen," or "linen," signifies truth from a celestial origin, which is truth from good (<a href="../ac/5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="../ac/9469.htm">9469</a>). That "a name written upon the vesture and upon the thigh," signifies truth and good, and their quality, is because "a vesture" signifies truth, and "a name" quality, as observed above, and "the thigh" signifies the good of love (<a href="../ac/3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="../ac/4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="../ac/4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="../ac/9961.htm">9961</a>, <a href="../ac/10485.htm">10485</a>). "King of kings, and Lord of lords," is the Lord as to the Divine truth and as to the Divine good; the Lord is called "King" from the Divine truth (<a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="../ac/5068.htm">5068</a>, <a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>). And He is called "Lord" from the Divine good (<a href="../ac/4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="../ac/9167.htm">9167</a>, <a href="../ac/9194.htm">9194</a>). Hence it appears what is the quality of the Word in its spiritual or internal sense, and that there is no expression therein which does not signify something spiritual, that is, something of heaven and the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Equo Albo 1 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>1. DE EQUO ALBO DE QUO IN APOCALYPSI, CAP. 19 <p>Apud Johannem in Apocalypsi ita describitur Verbum quoad Sensum spiritualem seu internum, "Vidi Caelum apertum, et ecce Equus Albus, qui Sedens super illo vocabatur fidelis et verus, et in Justitia judicat et pugnat: Oculi Ipsius flamma ignis; et super Capite Ipsius diademata multa; habens Nomen scriptum, quod nemo novit nisi Ipse: et circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine, et vocatur Nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei. Et Exercitus qui in Caelis, sequebantur Ipsum super equis albis, induti byssino albo mundo: et habet super vestimento et super femore suo Nomen scriptum, Rex Regum et Dominus Dominorum," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_11-14" target=_top>Apocalypsis 19:11-14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_16" target=_top>16</a>. Quid singula haec involvunt, nemo scire potest nisi ex sensu interno manifestum est, quod unumquodvis aliquod repraesentativum et significativum sit, nempe Coelum quod apertum, Equus qui albus, Sedens super illo, quod in Justitia judicans et pugnans, quod oculi Ipsius flamma ignis, quod super capite diademata multa, quod Nomen haberet quod nemo novit nisi ipse, quod circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine, quod Exercitus qui in Coelis sequerentur Ipsum super equis albis, quod illi induti byssino albo mundo, et quod super vestimento et super femore haberet Nomen scriptum; aperte dicitur quod sit Verbum, et quod sit Dominus qui Verbum, nam dicitur, "Vocatur Nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei;" et dein, "Habet super vestimento et super femore suo Nomen scriptum, Rex Regum et Dominus Dominorum." Ex interpretatione singularum vocum patet, quod hic describatur Verbum quoad Sensum spiritualem seu internum; quod Coelum sit apertum, repraesentat et significat, quod internus sensus Verbi videatur in Coelo, et inde ab illis in Mundo quibus Coelum est apertum; Equus qui albus repraesentat et significat intellectum Verbi quoad interiora ejus, quod Equus albus id significet, patebit a sequentibus; Sedens super illo, quod sit Dominus quoad Verbum, ita Verbum, constat, nam dicitur, vocatur Nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei; Qui Fidelis et in Justitia judicans vocatur ex Bono, ac Verus et in Justitia pugnans vocatur ex Vero, nam Ipse Dominus est Justitia; Oculi ejus flamma ignis, significant divinum Verum ex divino Bono divini Amoris Ipsius; super capite Ipsius diademata multa, significant omnia bona et vera fidei; Habens Nomen scriptum quod nemo novit nisi Ipse, significat quod quale est Verbum in sensu interno nemo videat quam Ipse, et cui Ipse revelat; circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine, significat Verbum in litera cui violentia illata; Exercitus in Coelis qui sequebantur Ipsum super equis albis, significant illos qui in intellectu Verbi quoad interiora sunt; Induti byssino albo mundo, significat eosdem in vero ex bono; super vestimento et super femore suo Nomen scriptum, significat verum et bonum et eorum quale. Ex his et ex illis quae praecedunt et sequuntur, patet, quod ibi praedicatur, quod circa ultimum tempus Ecclesiae Sensus spiritualis seu internus Verbi aperietur; sed quid tunc eveniet, etiam describitur ibi, Vers: 17-21. Quod illa significentur per ea verba, non opus est ut hic ostendatur, quoniam singula ostensa sunt in Arcanis Caelestibus, ut quod Dominus sit Verbum, quia est divinum Verum, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2533" target=_top>2533</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2803" target=_top>2803</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2884" target=_top>2884</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5272" target=_top>5272</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_1/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_7835" target=_top>7835</a>.
