<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p>WH2.在圣言的预言部分，经上多次提到马，但迄今为止，没有人知道“马”表示理解力，“骑马的”表示一个去理解的人；这或许是因为“马”在灵义上，因而在圣言中表示这种事物，显得既奇怪又不同寻常。然而，事实就是如此，这一点可从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，我在此只引用少许。以色列的预言论到但说：</p><p>但必作道上的蛇，路中的箭蛇，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的向后坠落。创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.17.htm">49:17</a>，18） </p><p>没有人能知道论到以色列支派中的一支的这个预言表示什么，除非他知道“蛇”、“马”和“骑马的”分别表示什么；然而，谁都知道其中隐含着某种属灵事物；至于每一个事物表示什么，可参看《属天的奥秘》一书（<a href="../ac/6398.htm">6398</a>，<a href="../ac/6399.htm">6399</a>，<a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>，<a href="../ac/6401.htm">6401</a>节），那里解释了这个预言。哈巴谷书：</p><p>神啊，你乘在马上，你的战车是拯救。你乘马践踏海。哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.8.htm">3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.15.htm">15</a>） </p><p>显然，在这段经文中，“马”表示某种属灵事物，因为这些话是指着神说的。否则，神“乘在马上”，并“乘马践踏海”会是什么意思呢？撒迦利亚书：</p><p>当那日，马的铃铛上必有归耶和华为圣。撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.20.htm">14:20</a>）</p><p>同一先知书：</p><p>耶和华说，到那日，我必使一切马匹惊惶，使骑马的颠狂；我必张开眼睛看顾犹大家，使万民的一切马匹瞎眼。撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.4.htm">12:4-5</a>）</p><p>这段经文论述了教会的荒凉，当不再明白任何真理时，这种情况就会发生。这种状态通过马匹和骑马的来描述；否则，“我必使一切马匹惊惶”、“使万民的一切马匹瞎眼”会是什么意思呢？这与教会能有什么关系呢？约伯记：</p><p>神使她忘记智慧，也没有把聪明赐给她；她几时把自己举到高处，就嗤笑马和骑马的人。约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯39.17.htm">39:17-19ff</a>）</p><p>“马”在此表示理解力，这是显而易见的。同样在诗篇，经上说神：</p><p>乘驾真理的话。诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.4.htm">45:4</a>）</p><p>另外还有其它许多经文。此外，若不知道“战车”表示什么，“以利亚和以利沙”代表什么，谁能知道以利亚和以利沙为何被称为“以色列的战车马兵”？又为何“少年人以利沙看见满山有火车火马”？因为以利沙对以利亚说：</p><p>我父啊，我父啊，以色列的战车马兵啊。列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.11.htm">2:11-12</a>）</p><p>约阿施王对以利沙说：</p><p>我父啊，我父啊，以色列的战车马兵啊。列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下13.14.htm">13:14</a>）</p><p>论到少年人以利沙时，经上说：</p><p>耶和华开了少年人以利沙的眼目，就看见了，看哪，满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下6.17.htm">6:17</a>） </p><p>以利亚和以利沙之所以被称为“以色列的战车马兵”，是因为他们两人都代表圣言方面的主，“战车”表示取自圣言的教义，“马兵”表示聪明。关于“以利亚”和“以利沙”代表圣言方面的主，可参看《属天的奥秘》一书（<a href="../ac/5247.htm">5247</a>，<a href="../ac/7643.htm">7643</a>，<a href="../ac/8029.htm">8029</a>，<a href="../ac/9372.htm">9372</a>节）；“战车”表示取自圣言的教义（<a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="../ac/8215.htm">8215</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The White Horse (New Century Edition 2020) 2</h4><p>2. Horses are often mentioned in the prophetic books of the Word, <sup>1</sup>but until now no one has been aware that a horse means understanding and its rider means someone who is intelligent. This is perhaps because it seems strange and bewildering to say that a horse has this kind of meaning when spiritually understood, and therefore has this kind of meaning in the Word. There is support for this, however, in many passages in the Word, of which I should like here to cite only a few. <p>In Israel’s prophecy about Dan:<p>Dan will be a serpent on the way, a darting serpent on the path, that bites the horse’s heels, and its rider falls backward. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_49_18.htm">18</a>)<p>No one will understand the meaning of this prophecy about one of the tribes of Israel who does not know the meaning of a serpent and of a horse and a rider. No one can fail to know, though, that something spiritual is involved. You may see what these particular things mean in <a href="../ac/6398.htm">Secrets of Heaven 6398</a>, <a href="../ac/6399.htm">6399</a>, <a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>, <a href="../ac/6401.htm">6401</a>, where this prophecy is explained.<p>In Habakkuk:<p>God, you are riding on your horses; your chariots are salvation. You walked through the sea with your horses. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">15</a>)<p>We can see that horses here mean something spiritual because these things are being said of God. Otherwise, what would be involved in God riding on his horses and walking through the sea with his horses?<p>The same holds true for <a href="3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>: “On that day ‘Holiness belongs to Jehovah’ will be engraved on the bells of the horses”; and for <a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_5.htm">5</a>: “‘On that day,’ says Jehovah, ‘I will strike every horse with confusion and its rider with madness. I will open my eyes on the house of Judah and strike every horse of the people with blindness.’” This is about the purging of the church that happens when there is no longer any understanding of what is true, so it is described in terms of horse and rider. Otherwise, what would be involved in striking every horse with confusion and striking every horse of the people with blindness? What does this have to do with the church? <p>In Job:<p>[Because] God deprived [the ostrich] of wisdom and did not endow her with understanding, when she lifts herself up on high, she scorns the horse and its rider. (<a href="3927/job_39_17.htm">Job 39:17</a>, <a href="3927/job_39_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/job_39_19.htm">19</a>, and following)<p>Here it is obvious that the horse means understanding. This is also the case in David when it speaks of “riding on the word of truth” (Psalms 45:4) and in many other passages.<p>Further, who would know why Elijah and Elisha were called “the chariot of Israel and its cavalry” and why Elisha’s servant saw the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire if they did not know what a chariot and a cavalry mean and what Elijah and Elisha represent? For Elisha said to Elijah, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its cavalry” (<a href="3927/2-kings_2_11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>, <a href="3927/2-kings_2_12.htm">12</a>); and King Joash said to Elisha, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its cavalry” (<a href="3927/2-kings_13_14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>); and it says of Elisha’s servant, “Jehovah opened the eyes of Elisha’s servant, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>The reason Elijah and Elisha were called the chariot of Israel and its cavalry is that both represent the Lord as the Word, the chariot meaning a body of teaching drawn from the Word and the cavalry meaning understanding. On Elijah and Elisha as representing the Lord as the Word, see <a href="../ac/5247.htm">Secrets of Heaven 5247</a>, <a href="../ac/7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="../ac/8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="../ac/9372.htm">9372</a>; and on a chariot as meaning a body of teaching drawn from the Word see §§<a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="../ac/8215.htm">8215</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;On the prophetic books of the Word, see note 4 in <a href="../njhd/260.htm">New Jerusalem 260</a>.

<h4 align="center">White Horse (Ryder translation 2007) 2</h4><p>2. In the prophetical parts of the Word a horse is mentioned very often, <sup>1</sup>but until now no one has known 'horse' means understanding, and 'horseman' one who understands, perhaps because it seems extraordinary and astonishing that that is what is meant by 'horse' in a spiritual sense, and consequently in the Word. But that it constantly means this can be agreed from very many instances in the Word, from which I should like to refer to only a few at this point. <p>In Israel's prophetic utterance <sup>2</sup>about Dan we find: <p>Dan will be a serpent on the road, a darting snake <sup>3</sup>on the path, that will bite the horse's heels, and the horseman will fall backwards. <a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17-18</a>.<p>What this prophetic statement about one of the tribes of Israel means no one is going to understand unless he knows what 'serpent' signifies, and also 'horse' and 'horseman." Yet is there anyone who does not see that it holds something spiritual within it? This being so, what the individual details signify may be seen in <a href="../ac/6398.htm">Arcana Caelestia 6398-6401</a>, where this prophetical utterance is explained. <p>In Habakkuk we find: <p>O Lord [...] You ride on Your horses and Your chariots are salvation [...] You caused Your horses to tread in the sea. <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">15</a>.<p>It is obvious that 'horses' here signify something spiritual, because these things are being said about God. What else would it be, 'God rode on [his] horses, and caused [his] horses to tread in the sea?' <p>In Zechariah we find, with a similar significance: <p>'On that day, HOLY TO THE LORD will be on the horse-bells', <a href="3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>. <sup>4</sup><p>In the same authority: <p>On that day I will strike every horse with bewilderment and the horseman with madness, declares the Lord, I will open my gaze on the house of Judah, and I will strike with blindness every horse of the peoples. <a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4-5</a>.<p>What is being talked about here is the Church when it has been laid waste, which happens when there is no longer an understanding of anything true. This is what is being indicated by 'horse' and 'horseman;' what else would it be, [...] every horse about to be struck with bewilderment [...] and the horse of the peoples with blindness?' What, otherwise, would this have to do with the Church? <p>In Job we find: <p>'Because God has made her <sup>5</sup>forget wisdom, neither has He imparted to her understanding; having raised herself on high, she mocks the horse and its rider' <a href="3927/job_39_17.htm">Job 39:17-19</a>. <p>That understanding is signified here by 'horse' is manifestly obvious; similarly in David, where the expression 'to ride upon the word of truth' is used, <a href="3927/psalms_45_5.htm">Psalms 45:5</a>; and besides in very many other places. <p>Moreover, who is likely to know why it is that Elijah and Elisha were called 'the chariots of Israel and its horsemen;' and why there appeared to Elisha's servant a mountain full of horses and fiery chariots, unless it is known what 'chariots' and horsemen' signify, and what Elijah and Elisha represented? For Elisha said to Elijah, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen,' <a href="3927/2-kings_2_11.htm">2 Kings 2:11-12</a>; and King Joash said to Elisha, 'My father, my father [...] the chariots of Israel and its horsemen,' <a href="3927/2-kings_13_14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>. <p>Concerning the servant of Elisha we read: <p>'The Lord opened the eyes of Elisha's servant, and he looked and saw the mountain full of horses and fiery chariots all around Elisha' <a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>.<p>Elijah and Elisha were called the chariots of Israel and its horsemen because each represented the Lord in his capacity as the Word. 'Chariots' represent doctrine derived from the Word, and 'horsemen' represent understanding. That Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in this capacity may be seen in <a href="../ac/5247.htm">Arcana Caelestia: 5247</a>, <a href="../ac/7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="../ac/8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="../ac/9327.htm">9327</a>, and that 'chariots' signify doctrine derived from the Word: <a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="../ac/8215.htm">8215</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The text has simply equus (horse) at this point, but there is a 'parallel passage' in <a href="../ac/2761.htm">Arcana Caelestia 2761</a>, stating equus et eques (horse and horseman): the sense of what follows in the current passage suggests that Swedenborg intends equus et eques here. <p>2.&nbsp;The Revd John Elliott points out that 'Israel here of course means the patriarch Jacob."<br><br>3.&nbsp;Biblical translations are based on the Schmidt Latin translation (1696) as apparently used by Swedenborg, though here, as sometimes elsewhere, Swedenborg does misquote (in this case inserting jaculus after the second serpens). Lewis and Shorts Latin Dictionary, always an interesting source, glosses jaculus as follows: 'sc. serpens, a serpent that darts from a tree on its prey." <br><br>4.&nbsp;The Revd John Elliott: As I understand it, this is not a statement on the horse-bells to the effect that the bells are holy but that they ring out the holiness of things attributable to the Lord. (A bit like the bells rung in a catholic mass which draw the worshippers' attention to the just-consecrated host or wine that is being elevated.)' <br><br>5.&nbsp;Her: The Hebrew pronoun in <a href="3927/job_39_17.htm">Job 39:17-18</a>, which refers to a bird, is feminine. Although Swedenborg rendered it eum (him) in <a href="../ac/2762.htm">2762</a> and here in De Equo Albo, eam (her) occurs in other places of his works where this verse is quoted. </p>
<h4 align="center">White Horse (Willmott translation 1955) 2</h4><p>2. A horse is mentioned many times in the prophetical parts of the Word, but that a horse means the understanding, and its rider one who understands, has hitherto been recognised by no one; and this, perhaps, for the reason that it appears strange and unusual that such a thing should be understood, in the spiritual sense, and thence in the Word, by a horse. Yet that it is always so can be confirmed from very many passages in the Word, only some of which I would quote here. In Israel's prophecy concerning Dan: <p>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an arrowsnake [A.V. adder] in the path, that biteth the horse's heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. <a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17-18</a>.<p>No one can understand what this prophecy concerning one of the tribes of Israel means, unless he knows what is meant by a serpent, and also by a horse, and its rider. There is no one who does not recognise that something spiritual is thereby implied. What, therefore, each individual thing means may be seen in <a href="../ac/6398.htm">6398</a>, <a href="../ac/6399.htm">6399</a>, <a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400</a>, <a href="../ac/6401.htm">6401</a>), where this prophecy is explained. <p>In Habakkuk: <p>O God Thou didst ride upon Thine horses, Thy chariots were [A.V. of] salvation.... Thou didst make Thy horses tread in the sea [A.V. walk through the sea with thine horses]. <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">15</a>. <p>It is evident that in this passage horses mean something spiritual, because these things are said concerning God. What otherwise would be meant by God riding upon His horses, and making His horses tread upon the sea? <p>In Zechariah: <p>In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD. <a href="3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>, where in like manner a spiritual meaning is implied. <p>Again in the same prophet: <p>In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. <a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>.<p>That passage treats of the vastation of the Church, which comes about when there is no longer the understanding of any truth. This state is thus described by a horse and its rider. What otherwise would be the meaning of every horse being smitten with astonishment, and of every horse of the people being smitten with blindness? What could this have to do with the Church? In Job:<p>God hath deprived her of wisdom, and hath not imparted to her understanding. What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. <a href="3927/job_39_17.htm">Job 39:17-19</a> et seq.. <p>It is clearly evident that here the understanding is signified by horse. Similarly in David, where [God] is said <p>To ride upon the Word of truth, <a href="3927/psalms_45_4.htm">Psalm 45:4</a>, in addition to many other passages. <p>Moreover, who would be able to know why it is that Elijah and Elisha were called the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof; and why by Elisha's servant the mountain was seen full of horses and chariots of fire; unless it were known what chariots and horsemen signify, and what Elijah and Elisha represented? For Elisha said to Elijah:<p>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. <a href="3927/2-kings_2_11.htm">2 Kings 2:11-12</a>.<p>And Joash the king said to Elisha: <p>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. <a href="3927/2-kings_13_14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>.<p>And, of Elisha's servant: <p>Jehovah opened the eyes of Elisha's servant, [A.V. the young man]; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. <a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>.<p>Elijah and Elisha were called the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof, because each of them represented the Lord as to the Word, and because by chariot is meant doctrine from the Word, and by horsemen, intelligence. That Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word, may be seen in <a href="../ac/5247.htm">5247</a>, <a href="../ac/7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="../ac/8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="../ac/9372.htm">9372</a>), and that chariots signify doctrine from the Word, (<a href="../ac/5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="../ac/8215.htm">8215</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">White Horse (Whitehead translation 1892) 2</h4><p>2. In the prophetical parts of the Word mention is very often made of the horse, but heretofore no one has known that "a horse" signifies the understanding, and his "rider" one who is intelligent; and this possibly, because it seems strange and wonderful, that by "a horse" such a thing should be meant in the spiritual sense, and thence in the Word. But nevertheless that it is so, may evidently appear from many passages therein; some of which only I will here adduce. In the prophecy of Israel, it is said of Dan: <p>Dan is a serpent upon the way, an arrow-snake upon the highway, that biteth the horse's heels, so that his rider shall fall backward (<a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17-18</a>). <p>No one can understand what this prophecy concerning one of the tribes of Israel signifies unless he knows what is signified by "a serpent," and what by "a horse" and his "rider;" everyone, however, knows that there is something spiritual involved therein; what therefore each expression signifies, may be seen in The Arcana Coelestia (<a href="../ac/6398.htm">6398-6399</a>, <a href="../ac/6400.htm">6400-6401</a>), where this prophecy is explained. In Habakkuk: <p>O God, Thou didst ride upon Thy horses. Thy chariots are salvation. Thou didst tread in the sea with Thy horses (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">3:8</a>, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_16.htm">16</a>). <p>That "horses" here signify what is spiritual, is evident, for they are said concerning God; in any other sense, what could be meant by saying, that "God rides upon His horses, and that He treads upon the sea with horses?" In like manner in Zechariah: <p>In that day, there shall be upon the bells of the horses, holiness unto Jehovah (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>). <p>In the same: <p>In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness; and I will open Mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>). <p>It treats there of the vastation of the church, which takes place when there no longer remains the understanding of any truth; and which is described thus by "the horse and his rider;" what else could be the meaning of "smiting every horse with astonishment," and of "smiting the horse of the people with blindness"? What has this to do with the church? In Job: <p>God hath caused her to forget wisdom, neither hath He imparted to her intelligence: what time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider (<a href="3927/job_39_17.htm">Job 39:17-18</a>, <a href="3927/job_39_19.htm">19</a>) That "the horse" here signifies the understanding, is manifestly evident. In like manner in David, where it is said: <p>He rideth upon the word of truth (<a href="3927/psalms_45_4.htm">Psalm 45:4</a>). <p>And in many other passages. Moreover, who can know the reason why Elijah and Elisha were called "the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof;" and why "the boy of Elisha saw the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire;" except it be known what is signified by "chariots," and what was represented by "Elijah and Elisha"? For Elisha said to Elijah: <p>My father, my father, the chariot and horsemen <sup>1</sup>of Israel and the horsemen thereof (<a href="3927/2-kings_2_11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>, <a href="3927/2-kings_2_12.htm">12</a>). <p>And Joash the king said to Elisha: <p>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof (<a href="3927/2-kings_13_14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>). <p>And, speaking of the boy of Elisha, it is said: <p>Jehovah opened the eyes of the boy of Elisha, and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). <p>The reason why Elijah and Elisha were called "the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof," is because they both represented the Lord as to the Word, and "a chariot" signifies doctrine from the Word, and "horsemen" intelligence. That "Elijah" and "Elisha" represented the Lord as to the Word, may be seen in The Arcana Coelestia (<a href="../ac/5247.htm">5247</a>, <a href="../ac/7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="../ac/8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="../ac/9327.htm">9327</a>).

In Prophetia Israelis de Dane, "Dan serpens super via, serpens jaculus super semita, mordens calcaneos Equi, et cadet Eques ejus retrorsum," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_17-18" target=_top>Genesis 49:17-18</a>; quid hoc Propheticum de una Tribu Israelis significat, nemo intellecturus est, nisi sciat quid significat serpens, tum quid Equus et Eques; quod spirituale sit quod involvitur, nemo non scit; quid itaque singula significant, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6398" target=_top>Arcanis Caelestibus 6398</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6399" target=_top>6399</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6400" target=_top>6400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6401" target=_top>6401</a>, ubi explicatur hoc Propheticum. Apud Habakuk, "Deus equitas super Equis tuis, Currus tui salus, calcare fecisti in mari Equos tuos; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_3_8" target=_top>Habakuk 3:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_3_15" target=_top>15</a>; quod Equi hic, significent spirituale, patet, quia illa dicuntur de Deo; quid alioquin foret, quod Deus equitaret super Equis suis, et quod calcare faceret super mari Equos suos. Apud Sachariam, "In die illo erit super tintinnabulis Equi Sanctitas Jehovae," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_14_20" target=_top>Sachariam 14:20</a>, similiter. Apud Eundem, "In die illo, dictum Jehovae, percutiam omnem Equum stupore, et Equitem amentia, et super domum Jehudae aperiam oculos meos, et omnem Equum populorum percutiam caecitate," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_12_4-5" target=_top>Sachariam 12:4-5</a>; agitur ibi de Ecclesiae vastatione, quae fit quando non amplius alicujus veri intellectus; hoc describitur ita per Equum et Equitem; quid alioquin foret quod omnis Equus percuteretur stupore, et quod Equus populorum percuteretur caecitate, quid hoc ad Ecclesiam. Apud Hiobum, "Oblivisci fecit Deus eum Sapientiam, et non impertitus est ei Intelligentiam, juxta tempus in altum elevavit se, deridet Equum et Equitem illius," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_39_17-19" target=_top>Hiobum 39:17-19</a> seq: quod hic per Equum significetur Intellectus, manifeste patet; similiter apud Davidem, ubi dicitur Equitare super verbum veritatis, Psalm 45:5 [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_45_4" target=_top>Psalm 45:4</a>]; praeter plurimis aliis in locis. Praeterea quis sciturus est, unde est, quod Elias et Elisaeus dicti fuerint Currus Israelis et Equites ejus; et cur puero Elisaei visus fuerit mons plenus Equis et Curribus igneis, nisi sciatur quid significant Currus et Equites, et quid repraesentaverunt Elias et Elisaeus; nam Elisaeus dixit ad Eliam, "Pater mi, Pater mi, Currus Israelis et Equites ejus," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_2_11-12" target=_top>2 Regum 2:11-12</a>: Et Joas Rex ad Elisaeum, Pater mi, Pater mi, Currus Israelis et Equites ejus," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_13_14" target=_top>2 Regum 13:14</a>. Et de puero Elisaei, "Aperuit Jehovah oculos pueri Elisaei, et vidit et ecce Mons plenus Equis et Curribus igneis circumcirca Elisaeum," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_6_17" target=_top>2 Regum 6:17</a>. Quod Elias et Elisaeus dicti fuerint Currus Israelis et Equites ejus, est quia uterque repraesentavit Dominum quoad Verbum, et per Currus significatur Doctrina e Verbo, et per Equites intelligentia: quod Elias et Elisaeus repraesentaverint Dominum quoad Verbum, videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5247" target=_top>5247</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_7643" target=_top>7643</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8029" target=_top>8029</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9327" target=_top>9327</a>, et quod Currus significent Doctrinam e Verbo, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5321" target=_top>5321</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-equo-albo_2/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8215" target=_top>8215</a>. </p>
