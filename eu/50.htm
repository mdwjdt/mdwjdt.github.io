<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第50节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>50、与木星灵长时间的来往清楚向我显明，他们比大多数星球的灵人更正直。他们到来的方式、与我的同住，及其那时的流注如此温柔和甜蜜，以至于无法形容。在来世，每个灵人的秉性都通过流注，也就是其情感的交流而显现；正直就显现为温柔和甜蜜；显现为温柔，是因为他害怕造成伤害；显现为甜蜜，是因为他喜欢行善。我能从我们地球的善灵所发的流注那里很清楚地辨别出木星灵所发流注的温柔和甜蜜。他们说，当他们之间产生细微的分歧时，就会看见一种细细的光芒，就像闪电，或像充满闪烁和游荡星星的小条带。不过，他们当中的一切分歧很快就得到解决。闪烁同时又游荡的星星表示虚假；而闪烁又固定的星星表示真理；因此，前者表示分歧。在圣言中，星星表示对良善与真理的认知，因而表示真理(AC 2495, 2849, 4697)。在来世，真理由固定的星星来代表，而虚假则由游荡的星星来代表(AC 1128)。</p>

<p>50. Spending a lot of time with spirits from Jupiter gradually made it plain to me that they are more upright than the spirits of many other planets. Their quiet approach <sup>1</sup>as they came to me, their presence, and the inflow <sup>2</sup>from them that ensued, was so sweet and gentle that there are no words to describe it. In the other life, the character of all spirits is quite evident because there is an inflow from them that communicates their feelings. Uprightness comes across as gentleness and sweetness, gentleness because the upright fear doing harm, and sweetness because they love doing good. I could tell very clearly how the type of gentleness and sweetness flowing in from good spirits of our planet differed from the type flowing in from theirs.
<p>They said that when some slight difference of opinion arises among them, they see a kind of thin white streak of light like a bolt of lightning, or else they see a narrow band of twinkling wandering stars; but the difficulties between them are soon resolved. Twinkling stars that wander mean something that is false, <sup>3</sup>while twinkling stars that are fixed mean something that is true; so the wandering stars were a reflection of their disagreement. <sup>4</sup>

<p>50. My long continued association with the spirits of Jupiter proved to me that they are more upright than the spirits of many other worlds. When they arrived, their coming, their stay and the influence they exerted were so gentle and sweet as to defy expression. In the next life the character of each spirit reveals itself in his influence, which is a sharing of his affection. Uprightness is revealed by gentleness and sweetness, by gentleness because he is fearful of doing harm, and by sweetness because he loves to do good. I could very clearly tell apart the gentleness and sweetness of good spirits from our world from that of theirs. They said that when any mild dispute arises between them, there is to be seen a kind of thin shaft of light, such as lightning often produces, or a band filled with flashing and moving stars. But a dispute among them is quickly settled. Stars which flash and at the same time move indicate falsity; flashing stars which are fixed indicate truth. So the former type indicates a dispute. <sup>1</sup>

<p>1.&nbsp;Stars in the Word mean cognitions of good and truth, that is, truths (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2495.htm">Arcana Caelestia 2495</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4697.htm">4697</a>). In the next life truths are represented by fixed stars, but falsities by wandering stars (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1128.htm">Arcana Caelestia 1128</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 50</h4><p>50. By long conversation with the spirits of the earth Jupiter, it was made manifest to me that they were more upright than the spirits of most other earths. The manner of their approach to me, their abode with me, and their influx at that time, was inexpressibly gentle and sweet. In the other life the quality of every spirit manifests itself by an influx, which is the communication of his affection; uprightness by gentleness and sweetness; by gentleness, in that he fears to do hurt, and by sweetness, because he loves to do good. I could clearly distinguish a difference between the gentleness and the sweetness of the influx proceeding from the spirits of Jupiter and of that which proceeds from the good spirits of our earth. When any slight disagreement exists among them, they said that there appears a sort of slender bright irradiation, like that of lightning, or like the little swath encompassing glittering and wandering stars; but all disagreements among them are soon adjusted. Glittering stars, which are at the same time wandering, signify what is false; but glittering and fixed stars signify what is true; thus the former signify disagreement. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Stars in the word signify the knowledges of good and truth, consequently truths (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2495.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2495</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4697.htm">4697</a>). And in the other life truths are represented by fixed stars, but falsities by wandering stars (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1128.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1128</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 50 (original Latin)</h4><p>50. Per diutinam conversationem cum Spiritibus Telluris Jovis, constabat mihi quod probiores essent spiritibus plurium aliarum Tellurum; allapsus eorum cum veniebant, commoratio et influxus tunc erat tam lenis et suavis, ut exprimi nequeat; qualitas cujusvis spiritus per influxum, qui est communicatio ejus affectionis, in altera vita se manifestat, probitas per lenitudinem et suavitatem, per lenitudinem quia timet nocere, et per suavitatem quia amat facere bonum: lenitudinem et suavitatem influxus a spiritibus bonis nostrae telluris ab illorum perclare distinguere potui. Dicebant, quando leve aliquod dissidium inter illos existit, quod appareat sicut tenuis radius candidus, qualis solet esse fulguris, vel fasciola in qua stellae coruscantes et erratiles; sed dissidium inter illos cito resarcitur: stellae coruscantes et simul erraticae significant falsum, at stellae coruscantes et fixae significant verum, ita illae dissidium. <sup>1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Quod stellae in Verbo significent cognitiones boni et veri, ita vera, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_50/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2495" target=_top>Arcana Coelestia 2495</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_50/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2849" target=_top>2849</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_50/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_4697" target=_top>4697</a>.
