<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第175节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>175、后来，我又问了这些灵人有关他们所来自的星球的各种问题，先问的是他们的神性敬拜和启示。关于敬拜，他们说，各民族及其家族每三十天聚在一个地方听讲道。这时，讲道者走上稍高出地面的一个讲坛，教导他们带来生活良善的神性真理。关于启示，他们说，启示发生在清晨，就在他们半睡半醒之间；那时，他们仍享有未被身体感官和世俗事物所打断的内在之光。在这种时候，他们从天堂听见天使谈论神性真理，以及如何照之生活。当他们完全醒来时，只见一位身穿白衣的天使站在他们床边，然后突然从他们的视线消失。他们由此知道他们所听到的话来自天堂。他们以这种方式区分神性异象和非神性异象，因为在非神性异象中是看不到天使出现的。他们补充说，他们的讲道人便以这种方式经历启示，其他人有时也经历这种启示。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 175</h4>
<p>175. Later I asked those spirits about various things on the planet they came from, first about their worship of God and about revelation. On the subject of their worship, they said that the peoples and their families gathered in a particular place every thirty days and listened to sermons. They said that at those times the preacher, from a pulpit raised up a bit from the ground, taught them divine truths that were conducive to leading a good life.
<p>On the subject of revelation, they stated that this comes to them in the morning, in a state between sleeping and waking, when they are in an inner light that has not yet been interrupted by physical and worldly sensory input. <sup>1</sup>At such times they hear angels of heaven talking about divine truths and about how to live by them; and later when they become fully awake, an angel dressed in white appears beside their bed, and then suddenly disappears from their sight. This is how they know that what they have heard comes from heaven. So they can tell the difference between visions from God and visions that are not from God: when the visions are not from God they do not see an angel. They added that revelations happen this way especially for their preachers, but sometimes for others as well.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;This “state between sleeping and waking” is also known as the hypnagogic state or the hypnopompic state, depending on whether it occurs while one is falling asleep or while one is waking up, respectively. Swedenborg describes it thus: “When we are in this state, it seems exactly as though we were awake; all our senses are as alert as they are when we are fully awake physically-sight, hearing, and strange to say, touch, which is then more exquisitely keen than it can ever be during physical wakefulness. This is the state in which people have seen spirits and angels most vividly. . . . It is the state described as being taken out of the body and not knowing whether one is in the body or outside it” (<a href="../hh/440.htm">Heaven and Hell 440</a>; emphasis in the original). In present-day literature, this phenomenon is sometimes also equated with the out-of-body experience, on which see Monroe 1971. [RS] </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 175</h4>
<p>175. Later I asked those spirits various questions about the world they came from, starting with questions on their worship of God and revelation. On the subject of worship they stated that clans assemble their families in one place every thirty days to listen to preaching. Then the preacher goes up into a pulpit raised a little off the ground and teaches them divine truths, which lead to goodness of life. On the subject of revelation they asserted that this takes place in the early morning when they are half-way between sleep and waking, while they are still enjoying inner light uninterrupted by bodily senses and worldly concerns. At this time they hear angels from heaven speaking about divine truths and how to live in accordance with them. When they reach full wakefulness, they see an angel dressed in white standing at their bedside, who then suddenly disappears from sight. This shows them that what they have heard is from heaven, and they can in this way tell apart a divine vision from one of another origin, for in this case the angel is not seen. They added that their preachers experience revelations in this manner, and so occasionally do others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 175</h4><p>175. I afterward questioned those spirits about various things on the earth from which they were, and first about their Divine worship and revelation. In regard to worship they said that the nations with their families assemble at one place every thirtieth day, and hear preaching; and that the preacher then, from a pulpit raised a little above the earth, teaches them Divine truths, which lead to the good of life. Concerning revelation they said that it came in the early morning, in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, when they are in interior light not yet interrupted by the bodily senses and by worldly things. And that they then hear angels of heaven speaking of Divine truths, and of a life according to them; that when they awaken, an angel in a white garment appears to them by the bed, who then suddenly disappears from their sight; and that from this they know that what they have heard is from heaven. In this way Divine vision is distinguished from vision not Divine; for in vision not Divine no angel appears. They added that revelations are made in this manner to their preachers, also sometimes to others. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 175 (original Latin)</h4><p>175. Postea interrogabam Spiritus illos de variis quae in Tellure, e qua erant; primum de Cultu eorum divino, et de Revelatione; de Cultu dicebant, quod Gentes cum familiis suis quovis trigesimo die ad unum locum conveniant, et audiant praedicationes; et quod Praedicator tunc e Pulpito aliquantum e terra elevato doceat illos Vera divina, quae ducunt ad bonum vitae. De Revelatione ajebant, quod illa fiat tempore matutino in statu medio inter somnum et vigiliam, quando in luce interiore nondum interpolata a sensibus corporeis et a mundanis sunt; et quod tunc audiant Angelos Coeli loquentes de Veris divinis, ac de vita secundum illa; et quod cum in vigiliam veniunt, appareat illis Angelus in veste alba ad lectum, qui tunc subito ab oculis illorum disparatur; et quod inde sciant, quod ex Coelo sint quae audiverunt: ita internoscitur Visio divina a visione non divina, nam in visione non divina Angelus non apparet: addebant quod tali modo Revelationes fiant apud Praedicatores eorum, quandoque etiam apud alios. </p>
