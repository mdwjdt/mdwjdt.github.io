<p>113. Why the Lord Wanted to Be Born on Our Planet and Not on Some Other
<p>There are many reasons why it pleased the Lord to be born and take on a human nature on our planet and not on some other, reasons about which I have been informed by a heavenly source. The main reason was for the sake of the Word, which was able to be written on our planet, and what was written was then able to be published throughout the whole planet; and once published, it was able to be preserved for all generations; and in this way it could become clear even to everyone in the other life that God had become a human. </p>

<p>113. VIII. THE REASONS WHY THE LORD CHOSE TO BE BORN IN OUR WORLD AND NOT IN ANOTHER 
<p>There are many reasons, as I was informed from heaven, why the Lord was pleased to be born and take on human nature in our world and not in another. THE CHIEF CAUSE was for the sake of the Word, which could thus be written in our world; and having been written, could be circulated throughout the world; and once circulated, could be preserved for all posterity, thus enabling it to be made plain that God became man, even to all in the next life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 113</h4><p>113. THE REASONS WHY THE LORD WAS WILLING TO BE BORN ON OUR EARTH, AND NOT ON ANOTHER. <p>There are many reasons, concerning which I had information from heaven, why it pleased the Lord to be born and to assume the human on our earth, and not on another. The PRINCIPLE REASON was because of the Word, in that it might be written on our earth; and when written be afterwards published throughout the whole earth; and when once published be preserved to all posterity; and that thus it might be made manifest, even to all in the other life, that God became Man. </p>

CAUSAE CUR DOMINUS IN NOSTRA TELLURE, et NON IN ALIA, NASCI VOLUIT<p>Quod Domino placuerit nasci, et Humanum assumere in nostra Tellure, et non in alia, sunt plures causae, de quibus e coelo informatus sum. CAUSA PRINCIPALIS fuit propter Verbum, quod hoc in nostra Tellure potuerit conscribi; et scriptum dein per universam Tellurem vulgari; et semel vulgatum conservari in omnem posteritatem; et quod sic manifestari potuerit, quod Deus Homo factus sit, etiam omnibus in altera vita. </p>
