<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第133节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>133、我向他们询问有关他们照亮其星球的星系太阳的情况，他们说，这太阳在那里看似火焰。当我向他们描绘我们地球太阳的大小时，他们声称，他们的太阳比我们的要小；在我们的眼中，他们的太阳就是一颗星星。我从天使那里听说，它是更小的恒星之一。他们还说，从他们的星球也能看到星空，比其它星星更大的星在他们看来朝向西方。我从天上被告知，这颗大星就是我们的太阳。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 133</h4>
<p>133. When I asked them about the sun of their solar system, which gives light to their planet, they said that the sun there looks fiery. When I showed them the size of the sun of our planet they stated that their sun was smaller. (Of course, to our eyes their sun is a star.) From angels as well I heard that their star is one of the smaller ones.
<p>They added that from their planet they too see a star-studded sky and that there is a star larger than the rest that they see toward the west. I was told by a heavenly source that it is our sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 133</h4>
<p>133. I asked them about the sun of their system which gives light to their world. They said that the sun there looks flame-coloured. When I pictured to them the size of the sun of our world, they declared that theirs was smaller; for their sun is to our eyes a star. I heard from angels that it is one of the smaller stars. They also said that the starry sky was visible from their world too, and a star larger than the rest is to be seen to the west of them. I was told from heaven that this is our sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 133</h4><p>133. They were asked about the sun of their system, which illumines their earth. They said that the sun there appears flamy; and when I represented the size of the sun of our earth, they said that theirs is smaller; for their sun to our eyes is a star, and I was told by angels that it is among the smaller stars. They also said that the starry heaven is likewise seen from their earth, and that a star larger than the rest appears to them toward the west. I was told from heaven that this is our sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 133 (original Latin)</h4><p>133. Interrogati sunt de Sole mundi eorum, qui illuminat Tellurem eorum, dicebant quod Sol ibi appareat flammeus; et cum magnitudinem Solis nostrae Telluris repraesentarem, ajebant, quod minor sit; nam Sol illis est coram nostris oculis Stella; et ab angelis audivi, quod esset Stella inter minores. Dicebant etiam, quod e tellure sua quoque coelum stelliferum videatur: quod Stella reliquis major appareat illis versus occidentem; dictum e coelo, quod illa sit noster Sol. </p>
