<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 1</h4>
<p>The Planets in the Universe
<p>The Earthlike Bodies Called Planets in Our Solar System and in Deep Space, Their Inhabitants, and the Spirits and Angels There, Drawn from Things Heard and Seen
<p>1. By the Lord’s <sup>1</sup>divine mercy the deeper levels within me, which belong to my spirit, have been opened, enabling me to talk with spirits and angels <sup>2</sup>-not only those near our world, but also those close to other planets. Because I have had a longing to know whether there are other worlds, what they are like, and what their inhabitants are like, the Lord has granted me opportunities to talk and interact with spirits and angels from other planets. With some of them I spent all day, with others a full week, and with still others months on end. I learned from them about the planets they came from and are close to now, about the life, customs, and worship of the inhabitants of those planets, and various other noteworthy details about them. Since it has been granted to me to know such things in this way, I am in a position to offer descriptions based on things I myself have heard and seen. <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>[2] It is important to know that all spirits and angels are human <sup>4</sup>and that they remain close to their planet of origin. <sup>5</sup>They know what is happening on that planet; and any people whose deeper levels have been opened to the point where they can talk and interact with spirits and angels can learn such things from those spirits and angels. After all, in our essence we too are spirits; <sup>6</sup>and in our deeper levels we are already among other spirits. <sup>7</sup>So anyone whose deeper levels have been opened by the Lord can talk with spirits and angels the way people talk with each other. <sup>8</sup>For twelve years now, this has been granted to me daily. <sup>9</sup>

<p>3.&nbsp;The Latin words here translated “based on things I myself have heard and seen” are ex auditis et visis, literally, “from things heard and seen.” It repeats a phrase that appears in the full Latin title of Other Planets. For more on the significance of this phrase, see note 2 in <a href="../lj/17.htm">Last Judgment 17</a>. [Editors]

<p>5.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] The spirits from each planet remain close to that planet, because they once lived there themselves, they have a nature similar to that of the current inhabitants, and the inhabitants need their help: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9968.htm">9968</a>.
<p>6.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] The soul that lives after death is our spirit, which is the essential person within us; in the other life it appears in a perfect human form: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/322.htm">322</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1880.htm">1880</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1881.htm">1881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3633.htm">3633</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4622.htm">4622</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6054.htm">6054</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6605.htm">6605</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6626.htm">6626</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7021.htm">7021</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10594.htm">10594</a>.
<p>7.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] Even while we are in this world, in our deeper levels, meaning our spirit or soul, we are surrounded by spirits and angels whose character is like our own: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2379.htm">2379</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3644.htm">3644</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4067.htm">4067</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4073.htm">4073</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4077.htm">4077</a>.
<p>8.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] It is possible for us to talk with spirits and angels; the early people on our planet did this frequently: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/67.htm">67</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/68.htm">68</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/69.htm">69</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/784.htm">784</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1634.htm">1634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1636.htm">1636</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7802.htm">7802</a>. These days, however, it is dangerous to talk with them unless we have true faith and are being led by the Lord: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/784.htm">784</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9438.htm">9438</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10751.htm">10751</a>.
<p>9.&nbsp;On the commencement of Swedenborg’s spiritual experiences, see note 2 in <a href="../lj/15.htm">Last Judgment 15</a>, and compare <a href="124.htm">Other Planets 124</a>. It may be noted that while this passage in Other Planets reports the length of Swedenborg’s spiritual experiences as twelve years, <a href="../hh/1.htm">Heaven and Hell 1</a> reports thirteen years, though both books were published in 1758. The simplest explanation for this discrepancy is that Other Planets was written before Heaven and Hell. On the order in which the works published in 1758 were actually written, see the editors’ preface, pages 29-33. [Editors] </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 1</h4>
<p>1. I. THE WORLDS IN SPACE 
<p>By the Lord's Divine mercy I have had my interior faculties, which belong to my spirit, opened, so that I have been enabled to talk with spirits and angels, not only those in the vicinity of our earth, but also with those near other worlds. Since therefore I was desirous of knowing whether there were other inhabited worlds, and what they and their inhabitants were like, I was allowed by the Lord to talk and mix with spirits and angels from other worlds. With some this lasted a day, with others a week, with yet others for months. I was informed by them about the worlds they came from and in the vicinity of which they were, about the life, behaviour and religious practices of their inhabitants, and other matters worth relating about them. Since I was allowed to gain my knowledge in this fashion, I can describe them from what I have heard and seen.</p>
<p>[2] It needs to be known that all spirits and angels are from the human race; <sup>1</sup>they are near their own world, <sup>2</sup>and know what happens there; and they can inform someone whose interior faculties are open sufficiently to be able to talk and mix with them. A human being is in essence a spirit, <sup>3</sup>and associates with spirits at the interior level. <sup>4</sup>Consequently anyone whose interior faculties are opened by the Lord can talk with them, exactly as a man can with another man. <sup>5</sup>I have been permitted to do this daily for the last twelve years.

<p>2.&nbsp;The spirits of each world are in the vicinity of their world, because they come from its inhabitants and share their character. It is also so that they can be of service to them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9968.htm">Arcana Caelestia 9968</a>). 
<p>3.&nbsp;The soul which lives on after death is a person's spirit, which is his real personality; in the next life it appears in a completely human form (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/322.htm">Arcana Caelestia 322</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1880.htm">1880-1881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3633.htm">3633</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4622.htm">4622</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6054.htm">6054</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6605.htm">6605</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6626.htm">6626</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7021.htm">7021</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10594.htm">10594</a>).

<p>5.&nbsp;A person can talk with spirits and angels; in ancient times people in our world often did so (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/67.htm">Arcana Caelestia 67-69</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/784.htm">784</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1634.htm">1634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1636.htm">1636</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7802.htm">7802</a>).

<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 1</h4><p>1. Since, from the Divine mercy of the Lord, the interiors, which are of my spirit, have been opened to me, and thereby it has been granted me to speak with spirits and angels, not only with those who are near our earth, but also with those who are near other earths; because I had a desire to know whether there are other earths, and what their nature is, and the quality of their inhabitants, therefore it has been granted me by the Lord to speak and converse with spirits and angels who are from other earths, with some for a day, with some for a week, and with some for months; and to be instructed by them concerning the earths, from which and near which they were; and concerning the lives, customs, and worship of the inhabitants thereof, and of various other things worthy to be related: and because in this manner it has been granted me to know these things, it is permitted to describe them from what has been heard and seen. It is to be known that all spirits and angels are from the human race; <sup>1</sup>and that they are near their own earths; <sup>2</sup>and that they know what is there; and that by them man may be instructed, if his interiors are so far opened that he can speak and converse with them; for man in his essence is a spirit, <sup>3</sup>and he is together with spirits as to his interiors; <sup>4</sup>wherefore he whose interiors are opened by the Lord, may speak with them as man with man; <sup>5</sup>which has been granted me now for twelve years daily. <p>FROM THE ARCANA COELESTIA; WHERE THESE AND THE FOLLOWING NOTES ARE EXPLAINED AND SHOWN. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There are no spirits and angels who are not from the human race (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1880.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1880</a>). <p>2.&nbsp;The spirits of every earth are near to their own earth, because they are from the inhabitants of that earth, and of a similar genius; and they are serviceable to those inhabitants (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9968.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9968</a>). <p>3.&nbsp;The soul, which lives after death, is the spirit of man, which is the real man in him, and also appears in the other life in a perfect human form (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/322.htm">Arcana Coelestia 322</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1880.htm">1880</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1881.htm">1881</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3633.htm">3633</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4622.htm">4622</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6054.htm">6054</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6605.htm">6605</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6626.htm">6626</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7021.htm">7021</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10594.htm">10594</a>). <p>4.&nbsp;Man, even when he is in the world, as to his interiors, thus as to his spirit or soul, is in the midst of spirits and angels, of a quality such as he is himself (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2379.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2379</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3645.htm">3645</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4067.htm">4067</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4073.htm">4073</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4077.htm">4077</a>).<p>5.&nbsp;Man can speak with spirits and angels, and the ancients on our earth frequently spoke with them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/67.htm">Arcana Coelestia 67-69</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/784.htm">784</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1634.htm">1634</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1636.htm">1636</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7802.htm">7802</a>).
