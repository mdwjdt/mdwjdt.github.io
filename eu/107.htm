<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第107节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>107、一些出现在金星这一侧，温和而有人性的人来拜访我；他们映入眼帘，就在我头上；我与他们谈论了各种话题。除此之外，他们还说，他们在世时就承认，并且现在因成了灵人而更承认我们的主是他们的独一神。他们声称，他们曾在他们星球上看见过祂，还向我描绘了主如何向他们显现。在巨人里面，这些灵人与物质事物的记忆有关；这记忆与非物质事物的记忆是一致的，水星灵便与非物质事物的记忆有关。因此，水星灵与这些金星灵最为和谐一致。所以，当他们在一起时，来自他们的流注在我头脑里激起一种显著的变化和强有力的活动（参看43节）。 </p>

<p>107. Some of the spirits who appear on the other side of that planet, the gentle and humane ones, came to me and stood where I could see them, just above my head. I talked with them about various subjects. They said, among other things, that when they were in the physical world they had acknowledged our Lord as their only God and that now their acknowledgment was even greater. They insisted that they had seen him on their planet and even represented for me how they had seen him.
<p>In the universal human, these spirits relate to a type of memory of matter-based concepts that harmonizes with the memory of non-matter-based concepts <sup>1</sup>to which the spirits from Mercury relate. Because of this, spirits from Mercury are very much in harmony with spirits from Venus; so when they were together, I felt a distinct change in my brain and strong activity within it as a result of an inflow from them (see <a href="43.htm">43</a> above).
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;“The memory of matter-based concepts” refers to the memory of people, places, things, and events in the material world, and of any other material or scientific subjects. It also includes knowledge learned in the material world about abstract, philosophical, and spiritual matters to the extent that these are simply facts or data stored in the memory. For more on the memory of matter-based concepts in comparison with the memory of non-matter-based concepts, which are spiritual and heavenly realities, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/608.htm">Secrets of Heaven 608</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1639.htm">1639</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2469.htm">2469-2494</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4901.htm">4901:3</a>; <a href="../hh/461.htm">Heaven and Hell 461-469</a>; Spiritual Experiences (= Swedenborg 1998-2013) 353, 1050-1051, 1077-1079, 1662, 1983-1984, 4342. On the correlation of memory with a particular locale in the human body and thus in the universal human of heaven, see note 1 in <a href="10.htm">Other Planets 10</a>. [LSW] </p>

<p>107. Some of those who are to be seen on the other side of the planet, those who are gentle and humane, came to visit me; they came into view above my head and I had conversations with them on various subjects. Amongst other things they said that when they were in the world they had acknowledged, and now did so more than ever, our Lord as their one and only God. They declared that they had seen Him in their world, and pictured to me how He had appeared to them. These spirits answer in the Grand Man to the memory of material things which is in agreement with the memory of immaterial things; this last is what the spirits of Mercury answer to. As a result the spirits of Mercury are very much in harmony with these spirits from Venus. So when they were together, the influence from them provoked a notable change and strong action on my brain (see <a href="43.htm">43</a> above). </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 107</h4><p>107. Some of those who appear on the further side of the planet, and who are mild and humane, came to me and were presented visibly above the head, and I spoke with them on various subjects. Amongst other things, they said that during their abode in the world, and more so since they were become spirits, they acknowledged our Lord as their only God. They added that on their earth they had seen Him, and they represented also how they had seen Him. These spirits in the Greatest Man have relation to the memory of things material, agreeing with the memory of things immaterial, to which the spirits of Mercury have relation: wherefore the spirits of Mercury have the fullest agreement with these spirits of Venus, and on this account, when they were together, a remarkable change, and a powerful operation in my brain, was perceivable from their influx; see above (<a href="43.htm">43</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 107 (original Latin)</h4><p>107. Quidam ex illis, qui ab altera parte Planetae apparent, et sunt mites et humani, ad me veniebant, et sistebantur mihi videndi supra caput, cum quibus varia loquutus sum; inter alia dicebant, quod, cum in mundo fuerunt, agnoverint, et quod magis nunc agnoscant Dominum nostrum pro suo unico Deo; ajebant, quod in Tellure sua viderint Ipsum, et quoque quomodo Ipsum viderant, repraesentabant. Hi Spiritus in maximo Homine referunt Memoriam rerum materialium concordantem cum Memoria rerum immaterialium, quam spiritus Mercurii referunt: quapropter spiritus Mercurii, cum his spiritibus Veneris maximopere concordant; ideo cum simul erant, sentita est ex influxu inde mutatio insignis, et operatio fortis in meo cerebro (videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_107/swedenborg_de-telluribus_43" target=_top>43</a>). </p>
