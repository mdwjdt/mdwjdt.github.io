<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>122、除上述原因外，需要补充的是，在巨人里面，我们地球的居民和灵人与属世和外在的感官有关；这种感官是生命的内层终结并作为它们的共同基础而止于其上的终点。文字上的神性真理，就是我们所说的圣言也一样，它也是为了这个原因被赋予这个星球而非其它星球。由于主就是圣言，是其首先的和末后的，所以为叫一切事物都照次序存在，祂选择在这个星球出生，并变成圣言，正如约翰福音所写的那样：</p><p>太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。道成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音1:1-4,14,18）</p><p>圣言是神性真理方面的主，因而是出自主的神性真理。不过，这是一个很少有人理解的奥秘。圣言在字义上是属世的(AC 8783)。这是因为属世层是属灵和属天层止于其上的最低层，可以说是其它各层建于其上的根基。圣言的内在意义或属灵意义若离了外在意义或属世意义，就如同没有地基的房屋(AC 9430, 9433, 9824, 10044, 10436)。圣言是神性真理方面的主，因而是出自主的神性真理(AC 2859, 4692, 5075, 9987)。万物都是藉着神性真理被创造和做成的(AC 2803, 2894 [原文2884], 5272, 7835 [或7678])。</p>

<p>122. In addition to the reasons just given, there is this: In the universal human the inhabitants and spirits of our planet relate to the external, physical senses, <sup>1</sup>and these senses are the outermost limit, in which the deeper planes of life find completion, and on which they come to rest as their shared foundation. It is much the same with the presence of divine truth in the writing that we call the Word, which for this reason too was given on this planet rather than on any other. <sup>2</sup>Since the Lord is the Word and is the first and the last of it, <sup>3</sup>he chose to be born and to become the Word on this planet so that everything would be done in accord with the divine design. This aligns with the following statements in John:
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and nothing that was made came about without him. And the Word became flesh and lived among us; and we saw his glory, glory like that of the only-begotten child of the Father. No one has ever seen God. The only-begotten Son, who is close to the Father’s heart, has made him visible. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>)
<p>The Word is the Lord as divine truth, so it is divine truth from the Lord. <sup>4</sup>This, though, is a mystery that only a few will grasp.

<p>1.&nbsp;The “external, physical senses” mentioned here could be any of the five senses: hearing, sight, and so on. See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4404.htm">Secrets of Heaven 4404</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5077.htm">5077</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/7038.htm">7038:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10236.htm">10236:2</a>; <a href="../dlw/41.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 41</a>; <a href="../tcr/461.htm">True Christianity 461:5</a>. However, Spiritual Experiences (= Swedenborg 1998-2013) <a href="../se/1741.htm">1741</a> suggests that the external sensory function that most of the spirits from our planet are associated with is the sensory function of the various skins membranes of the body. See also note <a href="../se/1.htm">1</a> in <a href="10.htm">Other Planets 10</a> on the association of mental functions with specific locations in the body. [LSW]
<p>2.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] In its literal meaning, the Word is earthly: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8783.htm">8783</a>. This is because what is earthly is the outermost limit, in which spiritual and heavenly realities find completion and on which they stand as on their foundation; and because otherwise the Word’s inner or spiritual meaning, lacking an outer or earthly meaning, would be like a house without a foundation: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9430.htm">9430</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9433.htm">9433</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9824.htm">9824</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10044.htm">10044</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10436.htm">10436</a>.
<p>3.&nbsp;The statement that “the Lord is the Word” draws on <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. Christ is referred to as the First and the Last in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>. Compare <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>. For further discussion of why the Lord is considered “the first and the last” of the Word, see <a href="../ss/98.htm">Sacred Scripture 98</a>; there the Lord is said to be the “first” of the Word because he was the Word on the innermost level, and its “last” because he became flesh and in so doing became the Word on the outermost level. [SS, LSW]
<p>4.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] The Word is the Lord as divine truth, so it is divine truth from the Lord: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2859.htm">2859</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9987.htm">9987</a>.

<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 122</h4>
<p>122. In addition to the reasons already noted, the inhabitants and spirits of our world answer in the Grand Man to the natural and external sense. This sense is the ultimate point at which the interiors of life come to an end, and in which they come to rest as on their common base. Divine truth in the letter, which we call the Word, is similar; and it was for this reason that it was given in this world and not in another. <sup>1</sup>And because the Lord is the Word, and its First and Last, it was so that everything should come into being in proper order that He chose to be born in this world, and to become the Word. This is in agreement with John's words: 
<p>In the beginning there was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made by His means, and nothing that was made was made without Him. And the Word was made flesh, and lived among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only son of the Father. No one has ever seen God, but the only son, who is in the Father's bosom, He has explained Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>. 
<p>The Word is the Lord in respect of Divine truth, and so Divine truth coming from the Lord. <sup>2</sup>But this is a mystery which few can understand. 
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;The Word is natural in its literal sense (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8783.htm">Arcana Caelestia 8783</a>). This is because the natural is the lowest level on which the spiritual and celestial levels rest, and as it were the foundation on which the others are built. Otherwise the inner or spiritual sense of the Word, if devoid of an outer or natural sense, would be like a house without foundations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9430.htm">Arcana Caelestia 9430</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9433.htm">9433</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9824.htm">9824</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10044.htm">10044</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10436.htm">10436</a>). 
<p>2.&nbsp;The Word is the Lord as regards Divine truth, and thus Divine truth coming from the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2859.htm">Arcana Caelestia 2859</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9987.htm">9987</a>).

<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 122</h4><p>122. To the reasons above adduced, may be added, that the inhabitants and spirits of our earth, in the Greatest Man, have relation to the natural and external sense, which sense is the ultimate wherein the interiors of life close, and rest as on their common basis. The case is similar in regard to the Divine truth in the letter, which is called the Word, and which for this reason also was given on this earth, and not on any other: <sup>1</sup>and because the Lord is the Word, and is the First and the Last thereof, therefore, that all things might exist according to order, He was willing to be born on this earth, and be made the Word, according to what is written in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made which was made. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father. No one has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath brought Him forth to view (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John1:1-14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>). <p>The Word is the Lord as to the Divine truth, thus the Divine truth from the Lord. <sup>2</sup>But this is an arcanum which falls within the understanding of only a few. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Word in the sense of the letter is natural (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8783.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8783</a>). By reason that what is natural is the ultimate, wherein spiritual and celestial things close, and on which they subsist as on their foundation, and that otherwise the internal or spiritual sense of the Word without the external or natural sense, would be as a house without a foundation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9430.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9430</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9433.htm">9433</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9824.htm">9824</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10044.htm">10044</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10436.htm">10436</a>). <p>2.&nbsp;The Word is the Lord as to the Divine truth, thus the Divine truth from the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/2859.htm">Arcana Coelestia 2859</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/5075.htm">5075</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9987.htm">9987</a>).
