<p>145. When I asked them about their sun, which to our eyes on Earth is a star, they said that it looked fiery and appeared no larger than a human head. I was told by angels that the star that is their sun is one of the smaller stars and is not far from the celestial equator. <sup>1</sup>
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;The celestial equator is a projection of the earth’s equator onto the sphere of the heavens. As a result of the earth’s tilt, the celestial equator stands at an angle of 23.5 degrees to the ecliptic, which is the path that the sun appears to trace in the sky during the course of a year.

<p>145. When asked about their sun, which is a star visible from our world, they said it has a fiery aspect, appearing no larger than a man's head. I was told by angels that the star which is their sun is one of the smaller ones, not far from the celestial equator. </p>

They were asked about their sun, which is seen as a star from our earth, and they said that it appears fiery; not larger to the sight than a man's head. I was told by angels that the star which is their sun is among the smaller stars, not far distant from the celestial equator. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 145 (original Latin)</h4><p>145. Interrogati sunt de Sole suo, qui est Stella coram oculis ex nostra Tellure; dicebant quod ille appareat igneus, ad visum non major quam Caput hominis: ab angelis mihi dicebatur, quod Stella, quae illis Sol, inter minores esset, non procul distans ab Aequatore coeli. </p>
