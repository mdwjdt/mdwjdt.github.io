<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第71节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>71、灵人与木星居民说话，并教导他们，以及若他们作恶，就严惩他们，这在木星是很平常的事。对此，他们的天使告诉我大量细节，所以我想依次讲述这些经历。灵人之所以能与木星人交谈，是因为他们花大量时间思想天堂和死后的生命，相对来说，很少关心世上的生活。他们知道，他们死后会继续活着；到那时，其状态的幸福取决于他们在世时所形成的内在人的状态。在地球的上古时代，与灵人并天使交谈也是平常事，原因是一样的，即：他们大量思想天堂，很少思想世界。但随着时间推移，与天堂的直接交流中断了，因为世人从内在变得外在，或也可说，他开始大量思想世界，很少思想天堂。当他不再相信天堂与地狱的存在，或人本身是一个死后仍活着的灵时，更是如此。因为当今时代，人们都以为身体凭自己拥有生命，也就是说，靠自己活着，而不是靠它的灵活着。因此，如今人们若不信带着身体复活，就根本不信有复活这回事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 71</h4>
<p>71. It is quite common on that planet for spirits to talk with the inhabitants, to teach them, and also to punish them if they have done evil things. Their angels have told me many things about this, so I would like to lay out some of them here.
<p>The reason spirits talk with the inhabitants there is that the inhabitants give a great deal of thought to heaven and life after death and are not as concerned with their life in the world. They know that they are going to continue living after they die and that they will be in a happy state in accord with the state of their inner self that has taken shape in the world.
<p>In ancient times, on our planet too talking with spirits and angels was normal, for the same reason-because people then were thinking a lot about heaven and not much about the world; but that living communication with heaven was later closed off when we turned from being internal to being external, or (which is the same thing) began to give a great deal of thought to this world and little to heaven. This was even more the case when we no longer believed in the existence of heaven and hell or saw ourselves as essentially spirits who would go on living after death. In fact, nowadays people believe that the body has a life of its own and no longer think it is sustained by its spirit. So the only kind of resurrection they can believe in is that they will be resurrected in their bodies. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 71</h4>
<p>71. It is a common event in that world for spirits to talk with its inhabitants, teaching them, and chastising them if they have misbehaved. Since I was told a great deal about this by their angels, I should like to report these experiences in order. The reason why spirits talk with people there is that they spend a lot of time thinking about heaven and life after death, and are relatively little concerned about life in the world. They know they will go on living when they die, and that the happiness of their state then depends upon the state of their internal man, which was formed in the world. Talking with spirits and angels was also a common event in this world in ancient times for the same reason: they thought much about heaven and little about the world. But in course of time that direct communication with heaven was cut off, as man became external instead of internal, or, which is the same thing, he began to think much about the world and little about heaven. This was even more the case when he no longer believed in the existence of heaven and hell, or in his possession of a personal spirit to live on after death. For at the present time the body is believed to have a life of its own instead of one coming from its spirit. If people therefore did not now have a belief in resurrection with a body, they would have no belief in resurrection at all. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 71</h4><p>71. It is common on that earth for spirits to speak with the inhabitants and to instruct them, and also to chastise them if they have done evil, in regard to which since many things have been related to me by their angels, I wish to repeat them in order. The reason why spirits speak with the men there, is that they think much about heaven and about the life after death, and have comparatively little solicitude about life in the world; for they know that they are to live after death, and in a state happy according to the state of their internal man, formed in the world. To speak with spirits and angels was also common on this earth in ancient times, and for the same reason, namely, because they then thought much of heaven and little of the world. But that living communication with heaven in process of time was closed, as man from internal became external, or what is the same, as he began to think much about the world and little about heaven; and still more when he no longer believed that there is a heaven or a hell, nor that man in himself is a spirit which lives after death; for at this day it is believed that the body lives from itself, and not from its spirit; wherefore unless man now believed that he will rise again with the body, he would have no belief in the resurrection. </p> 
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 71 (original Latin)</h4><p>71. Commune est in illa Tellure, quod Spiritus loquantur cum incolis, et instruant eos, et quoque castigent si male egerant; de qua re quia plura mihi ab Angelis eorum relata sunt, velim ordine illa memorare. Quod Spiritus ibi cum hominibus loquantur, est causa quia multum cogitant de coelo, et de vita post mortem; et quod de vita mundi respective parum solliciti sint; sciunt enim quod victuri cum obeunt, et in statu felici secundum statum interni sui hominis formatum in mundo. Loqui cum Spiritibus et Angelis etiam commune fuit in hac Tellure antiquis temporibus, ex simili causa, quod nempe cogitaverint de coelo et parum de mundo: sed communicatio illa viva cum coelo tempore clausa est, sicut homo ab Interno factus est Externus, sive quod idem, sicut cogitare coepit multum de mundo, et parum de coelo; et magis cum non amplius crederet dari coelum nec infernum, nec in se esse hominem spiritum qui vivat post mortem: hodie enim creditur quod corpus vivat ex se, et non ex suo spiritu; quare nisi homo nunc fidem haberet, quod cum corpore resurrecturus esset, nullam de resurrectione fidem haberet. </p>
