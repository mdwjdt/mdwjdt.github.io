<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>129、穿越这道巨大的鸿沟后，我终于到了能停下来的地方。然后，一些灵人出现在我头顶上，我能与他们交谈。从他们的言语，以及理解并解释问题的方式，我能清楚发觉他们来自另一个星球，因为他们与我们太阳系的灵人迥然不同。他们从我的言语也发觉我来自远方。</p>

<p>129. After being taken across that vast abyss I finally reached a place where I could stop for a while. Some spirits then appeared above me, and I was able to talk with them. From their manner of speaking and their unique way of perceiving things and expressing their views I could clearly tell that they were from an extrasolar planet, since they were completely different from the spirits of our solar system. They could also tell from my speech that I was from far away. </p>

<p>129. After travelling through that great gap, I finally reached a place where I could stop. Then some spirits appeared to me overhead, and I was able to talk with them. From their speech and from the way they grasped matters and set them forth, I could clearly observe that they came from another world, for they were quite different from the spirits of our solar system. They too could tell from my speech that I came from a great distance. </p>

Afterwards I was carried along through that great chasm, and at length I arrived at a place where I stopped; and there then appeared to me spirits overhead with whom it was given me to speak. From their speech, and from their genius of apprehending and explaining things, I clearly perceived that they were from another earth for they were quite different from the spirits of our solar system. They also perceived from my speech that I was from afar. </p>

Postquam per magnum illum Hiatum translatus fui, tandem perveni ad locum ubi morabar; et tunc apparebant mihi Spiritus superne, cum quibus loqui datum est: ex loquela eorum, et ex genio appercipiendi res et exponendi illas, clare animadverti quod essent ex alia Tellure, nam prorsus differebant a spiritibus mundi nostri Solis: illi etiam ex mea loquela appercipiebant, quod e longinquo essem. </p>
