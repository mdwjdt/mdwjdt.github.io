<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 97</h4>
<p>97. The spirits from that planet, like the planet itself, appear out in front at a considerable distance, down on a level with the knees. When one looks in that direction, a whole crowd of spirits comes into view, all of them from that planet. They are observed on the near side of that planet, toward the right.
<p>I have been allowed to talk with them and from our conversation to learn what they are like in comparison to others. They are upright and modest; and since they think little of themselves, in the other life they actually look small as well. </p>

<p>97. V. ON THE WORLD OR PLANET OF SATURN, AND ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS 
<p>The spirits from that world are to be seen in front at a considerable distance, lower down on a level with the knees; and this is where that world too appears. When the gaze is turned in that direction, a great number of spirits, all from that world, comes into view. They are to be seen on this side of that world, and to the right of it. I was allowed to talk with them too, and so to discover what they are like as compared with others. They are upright and restrained; and because they have a low opinion of themselves, they also appear small in the next life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 97</h4><p>97. THE EARTH OR PLANET SATURN, ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS. <p>The spirits from the earth Saturn appear in front at a considerable distance, beneath in the plane of the knees, where the earth itself is; and when the eye is opened to see thither, a multitude of spirits come into view who are all from that earth. They are seen on this part of that earth, and to the right of it. It has also been granted to speak with them, and thereby to know their quality in comparison with others. They are upright and modest, and inasmuch as they esteem themselves little, therefore they also appear small in the other life. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 97 (original Latin)</h4><p>97. DE TELLURE SEU PLANETA SATURNI, DEQUE EJUS SPIRITIBUS et INCOLIS<p>Spiritus ex illa Tellure, ubi ipsa Tellus, apparent antrorsum ad insignem distantiam, inferius in plano genuum: et cum aperitur illuc oculus, in conspectum venit multitudo spirituum, qui omnes sunt ex illa Tellure: conspiciuntur ab hac Telluris illius parte, et ad dextrum ejus. Datum est quoque cum illis loqui, et inde cognoscere, quales sunt respective ad alios: sunt probi, et sunt modesti; et quia se parvos aestimant, ideo quoque in altera vita apparent parvi. </p>
