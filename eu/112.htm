<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第112节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>112、灵人和天使都知道月球上有居民，围绕木星和土星旋转的卫星上同样有居民。那些即使没有见过那里的灵人并与其交谈的人仍毫不怀疑这些卫星上也有人，因为它们同样是星球；哪里有星球，哪里就有人。事实上，每个星球都是为了人类而被造的；并且至高无上的造物主无论造什么东西，都是有目的的。人类是创造的目的，以便天堂能由人类形成；凡理性稍稍被启示的人都能肯定这一点。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 112</h4>
<p>112. Spirits and angels know that there are people living on the Moon just as there are on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Even the spirits who have not seen and talked with spirits from these moons have no doubt that there are people there because the moons are planets, too, and where there is a planet there are people. Humanity is, after all, the purpose for which planets exist, and the Supreme Creator has done nothing without a purpose. Anyone who thinks with even slightly enlightened reason can conclude that creation came about so that heaven could arise from humankind. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 112</h4>
<p>112. Spirits and angels know that there are inhabitants on the moon too, and equally on the moons or satellites around the planets Jupiter and Saturn. Those who have not seen spirits from there and talked with them are still in no doubt that there are people on these moons, because they are just as much worlds; and where there is a world, man is to be found. Man is the purpose for which a world exists, and the supreme Creator made nothing without a purpose. Anyone whose reason is at all enlightened can be sure that the purpose of creation is the human race, so that heaven can be formed from it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 112</h4><p>112. That there are also inhabitants on the Moon, spirits and angels know, and in like manner that there are inhabitants on the moons or satellites which revolve about the earths Jupiter and Saturn. They who have not seen and spoken with spirits therefrom, still do not doubt but that there are also men upon them, because they are equally earths; and where there is an earth, there are men; for man is the end for which every earth was created, and nothing was made by the Great Creator without an end. That the human race is the end of creation, that from it there may be a heaven, may appear to every one who thinks from a somewhat enlightened reason. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 112 (original Latin)</h4><p>112. Quod etiam in Luna sint Incolae, sciunt spiritus et angeli, pariter quod in Lunis seu Satellitibus circum tellurem Jovis, et tellurem Saturni. Qui non spiritus inde viderunt, ac cum illis loquuti sunt, usque non dubitant, quin etiam super illis homines sint, quia aeque sunt tellures; et ubi tellus ibi est homo; homo enim est finis propter quem tellus, et a summo Creatore nihil sine fine factum est: quod finis creationis sit humanum genus, ut ex eo Coelum, cuivis, qui ex ratione aliquantum illustrata cogitat, constare potest. </p>
