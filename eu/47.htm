<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第47节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>47、灵人和天使看不见木星；因为灵界居民看不到一个星球，只有从那里来的灵人和天使才能看到。来自木星的灵人出现在左前方很长一段距离处，并始终保持在这个位置(参看42节)。他们的星球也在那里。每个星球的灵人都在他们自己的星球附近，因为他们出自其居民。事实上，每个人死后都会成为一个灵人。由于具有相似的秉性，所以他们也能与这些居民在一起，并服务于他们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 47</h4>
<p>47. The actual planet Jupiter is in no way visible to spirits and angels because there is no way for any planet to be visible to people in the spiritual world-only the spirits and angels who come from that planet are visible. The ones from the planet Jupiter can be seen toward the front on the left at a fair distance, and this location is constant (see <a href="42.htm">42</a> above). That is where spirits and angels visualize the planet as being, too. The spirits from each planet are near their planet because they were originally among that planet’s inhabitants (since everyone becomes a spirit after death) and also because their character is similar to that of the inhabitants and therefore they can be with them and be of service to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 47</h4>
<p>47. The world or planet of Jupiter is not visible to spirits and angels. No one there can ever see a planet, only the spirits and angels who came from it. Those from Jupiter are to be seen in front to the left at a considerable distance, and they constantly keep this position (see <a href="42.htm">42</a> above). Their planet too is there. The spirits of each world are in the vicinity of their own planet, because they come from its inhabitants. (Every person after death becomes a spirit.) Being of similar character, they are able to associate with the inhabitants and be of service to them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 47</h4><p>47. The earth itself or planet Jupiter does not indeed appear to spirits and angels: for to the inhabitants of the spiritual world no earth is visible, but only the spirits and angels who come thence. They who are from the planet Jupiter appear in front to the left, at a considerable distance, and this constantly, see above (n. <a href="42.htm">42</a>); there also is the planet. The spirits of every earth are near their earth, because they are from its inhabitants, for every man after death becomes a spirit, and because they are thus of a similar genius, and can be with the inhabitants, and serve them. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 47 (original Latin)</h4><p>47. Ipsa Tellus seu Planeta Jovis non quidem apparet Spiritibus et Angelis; nam nusquam aliquibus ibi apparet aliqua Tellus, sed modo spiritus et angeli qui inde sunt: qui e Planeta Jovis sunt, apparent antrorsum ad sinistrum ad aliqualem distantiam, et hoc constanter (vide supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_47/swedenborg_de-telluribus_42" target=_top>42</a>), ibi quoque est Planeta; sunt spiritus cujusvis telluris juxta suam tellurem, ex causa quia ex incolis sunt, (nam omnis homo post mortem fit spiritus) et quia sic simili genio sunt, et possunt apud incolas esse, et illis inservire. </p>
