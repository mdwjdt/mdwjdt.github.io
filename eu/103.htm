<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第103节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>103、土星灵进一步告诉我有关土星居民的事，透露他们的社会性质，以及其它细节。他们说，他们分为各个家庭生活，每户家庭都与其它家庭分开。所以一个丈夫和他的妻子，以及他们的子女形成一个家庭。当子女结婚时，他们就离开父母的家，不再关心它。因此，土星灵都是成双成对出现。他们不太讲究衣食，靠他们星球出产的果实和蔬菜生活。他们穿得很薄，因为他们外面裹有可以御寒的厚皮衣或外套。此外，他们告诉我，在他们星球，所有人都知道自己死后会活着；所以他们根本不在意身体，只要存活即可，也就是说，仅关心照他们所说，要留下来事奉主的那生命。正因如此，他们也不埋葬死者的尸体，而是把它们扔出去，用森林里的树枝盖住它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 103</h4>
<p>103. Spirits from that planet have also given me information about the social structures of the people who live there, among other things. They said that the inhabitants live divided into families, each family separate by itself, just a husband and wife with their children. When they marry they leave the home of their parents and are no longer concerned with it; therefore the spirits from that planet are seen in twos.
<p>They do not make much fuss about food and clothing. They eat the fruits and vegetables that their land yields and their clothing is simple-they wrap themselves in a thick pelt or cloak that protects them from the cold.
<p>Further, all the people on that planet know that they will go on living after death, so they attach little importance to their bodies-only as much as is necessary for living, which they call continuing to serve the Lord. For the same reason, too, they do not bury the bodies of their dead but discard them and cover them with tree branches from the forest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 103</h4>
<p>103. I was given further information by the spirits of that world about its inhabitants, revealing amongst other things the nature of their society. They said that they live grouped into families, each one separate from others. So a husband and wife with their children form a group. When the children marry, they leave their parents' home and take no further interest in it. As a result the spirits of that world are to be seen in pairs. They do not bother much about food and clothing. They live on the fruits and vegetables their world produces. They wear light clothing, since they are protected by a thick skin or coating, which keeps out the cold. Moreover, they told me that all the people in their world know that they will live on after death, so they pay no attention to their bodies, except so far as to keep alive. Life they say will continue, and serve the Lord. It is for the same reason too they do not bury the bodies of the dead, but throw them out, covering them with branches from the trees of the forest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 103</h4><p>103. I was further informed by the spirits of that earth respecting the inhabitants, what their consociations are, with several other particulars. They said that they live distinguished into families, every family apart by itself; each family consisting of a man and his wife with their children; and the children, when they enter the married state, are separated from the parental house, and have no further care about it. Wherefore the spirits from that earth appear two and two. They are little solicitous about food and raiment, they feed on the fruits and legumes their earth produces; and they are clothed slightly, being encompassed with a coarse skin or coat, which repels the cold. Moreover, all on that earth know that they will live after death; and that on this account also they make light of their bodies, only so far as regards that life, which they say is to remain and serve the Lord. It is for this reason likewise that they do not bury the bodies of the dead, but cast them forth, and cover them with branches of forest trees. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 103 (original Latin)</h4><p>103. Porro a spiritibus illius Telluris informabar de Incolis, quales illorum consociationes sunt, praeter alia; dicebant, quod vivant distincti in familias, unaquaevis familia separata ab alia; ita vir et uxor, cum suis liberis; et quod hi, cum conjugia jungunt, separentur a domo parentum, nec eam amplius curent: quapropter Spiritus ex illa Tellure apparent bini et bini. Quod de Victu et Amictu parum solliciti sint; quod vescantur fructibus et leguminibus, quae Tellus eorum producit; et quod vestiantur leviter, quoniam crassa cute seu tunica, quae repellit frigus, cincti sunt. Praeterea, quod omnes in sua Tellure sciant, quod victuri sint post mortem; et quod ideo etiam corpora sua nihili faciant, modo quantum propter vitam, quam dicunt permansuram et servituram Domino; quod ideo quoque corpora mortuorum non sepeliant, sed projiciant, et tegant ramis arborum e sylva. </p>
