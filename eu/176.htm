<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第176节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>176、当被问及他们所住的房屋时，他们说，这些房屋都很低矮，是木质结构的，屋顶是平的，被倾斜而下的带子所围绕。丈夫和妻子住在前面，孩子住在隔壁，男女仆人住在后面。关于他们的食物，他们说，他们将牛奶和水掺在一起喝；牛奶是从奶牛获得的，这些奶牛毛茸茸的，就像我们的绵羊。关于他们的生活，他们说，他们赤身行走，并不因赤身而感到羞耻。他们的来往仅限于同一个家族中的人当中。</p>

<p>176. When we asked about their homes, they said that they were low and made of wood, with a flat roof surrounded by a downward sloping rim. The husband and wife live in the front part of the home, their children in an adjacent room, and servants, female and male, at the back.
<p>As for their food, they said that they drink milk with water and that the milk comes from cows that have wool like sheep. As for the way they live, they go naked and their nakedness is not a matter of shame to them. They limit their interactions to people within their extended families. </p>

<p>176. When asked about the houses they lived in, they said that these were low wooden constructions, with a flat roof surrounded by a band sloping downwards. The front part is occupied by husband and wife, the next adjacent room by the children, the rear by male and female servants. On the subject of food, they said they drank a mixture of milk and water. The milk came from cows, which had fleeces like our sheep. Asked how they lived, they said they go about naked and feel no shame at their nakedness. They restrict their contacts to those within the same family. </p>

To an inquiry concerning their houses, they said that they are low, of wood, with a flat roof, around which project caves sloping downward; and that in the front part dwell the husband and wife, in the next adjoining part the children, and after them the maid-servants and men-servants. Of their food they said that they drink milk with water, and that they have the milk from cows, which are woolly like sheep. Of their life they said that they walk naked, and that to them nakedness is not a cause of shame; also that their social interaction is with those who are within their families. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 176 (original Latin)</h4><p>176. Ad interrogationem de domibus eorum, dicebant, quod illae humiles sint, ex lignis, cum tecto plano, circum quod limbus obliquatus deorsum; et quod anterius ibi habitent Maritus et Uxor, in contiguo proximo liberi, post ancillae et famuli. De Cibo dicebant, quod bibant lac cum aqua; et quod lac illis sit ex vaccis, quae lanigerae sicut oves. De vita eorum dicebant, quod ambulent nudi, et quod nuditas illis non pudori sit: tum quod conversationes illorum sint cum illis qui intra familias. </p>
