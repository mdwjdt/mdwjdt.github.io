<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第146节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>146、我看见相貌和在世为人时一样的灵人。他们的脸和我们地球人的脸没什么区别，只是眼睛和鼻子都很小。这在我看来相当丑，有点畸形；可他们声称，对他们来说，小眼睛、小鼻子是美丽的标志。我看见一个女人，她身穿带有各种颜色玫瑰图案的长袍。于是，我问在这个星球，他们用什么材料制作衣服。他们回答说，他们从植物中搜集可以纺成线的材料，然后把线并排铺成两层和三层，并用一种粘液湿润，使其具有黏稠度，然后用草药染料上色。他们还向我演示他们如何纺线：女人们斜向后坐在地上，用脚趾头拧线；线一拧，她们就拉过来，用手把线拧完。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 146</h4>
<p>146. I saw some spirits from that planet who looked the same way they had during their lives there. Their faces are not all that different from the faces of people on our planet except that their eyes and noses are small. This made their faces look distorted to me, but they explained that they consider small eyes and a small nose to be most beautiful.
<p>I saw a woman wearing a robe that had on it roses of various colors. I asked what they make their clothing from, and they replied that they take plant material and make it into threads, then place the threads together in double or triple layers and moisten them with an adhesive fluid so that they hold together. They then color the fabric with vegetable dyes.
<p>I was also shown how they make their thread. They sit half-reclined in a chair and twist the thread with their toes, then pull the twisted thread toward themselves and work it with their hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 146</h4>
<p>146. I saw spirits who looked as they had done when they were living in their world. Their faces were not unlike those of people in our world, except that their eyes were small, and so were their noses. This seemed to me rather ugly, but they said that small eyes and noses are a mark of beauty to them.
<p>I saw a woman wearing a gown patterned with roses of different colours. So I asked where in that world they got their clothes. They replied that they gather from plants material which they spin into thread, and they arrange the threads in layers <sup>1</sup>of double or triple thickness, wetting the cloth with a sticky liquid to give it consistency, and subsequently colouring the woven cloth with herbal dyes. I was given a demonstration of how they make thread. The women sit half-lying <sup>2</sup>on the ground and use their toes to twist it, and when twisted they pull it towards themselves and work it up with their hands.

<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 146</h4><p>146. Spirits were seen, in a similar appearance to what they had when they were men on their earth. They had a face not unlike that of the men of our earth, except that the eyes and nose were smaller. As this seemed to me somewhat of a deformity, they said that to them small eyes and a small nose are marks of beauty. A woman was seen, dressed in a gown on which were roses of various colors. I inquired of what materials they make their garments on that earth. They answered that from plants they gather such things as they can spin into threads, and that they then lay the threads side by side in double and triple layers, and moisten them with a glutinous liquid, and so give it consistency, coloring it afterward with juices from herbs. I was likewise shown how they prepare the threads: they sit leaning back on a seat, and twist the thread with the toes; and when it is twisted, they draw it to them, and finish it with the hands. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 146 (original Latin)</h4><p>146. Visi sunt spiritus, qui similes sibi cum homines in sua tellure fuerunt; erant facie non absimili faciei hominum nostrae Telluris, praeter quod Oculi eorum parvi essent, et quoque Nasus parvus: hoc quia videbatur mihi ut aliquantum deforme, dicebant quod parvi oculi et parvus nasus illis pulchritudo sint. Foemina visa est, induta toga, in qua rosae varii coloris: quaerebam unde in tellure illa sibi parant vestes, respondebant, quod legant ex herbis talia quae contexunt in fila; et quod fila dein statim componant duplici ac triplici ordine, ac humectent aqua glutinosa, et sic consistentiam inducant, colorando illam telam postea ex succis herbaceis. Ostensum quoque est, quomodo parant fila; sedent desupinatae in solio, et per digitos pedum convolvunt illa, et convoluta trahunt ad se, et subigunt per manus. </p>
