<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>166、此外，我还看到他们在这个星球上的居所。这些居所是长长的矮房子，照着所划分房间的数量而在两侧各有窗户。屋顶呈拱形，尽头两边各有一扇门。他们说，这些房屋是用泥土建的，屋顶铺有草皮。窗户是用草线制成的，这些草钱被编织起来，以便光能照进来。我还看到一些孩子。他们说，他们的邻居来拜访他们，尤其为了自己的孩子，以便这些孩子能与其他孩子在其父母的视线和看顾之下做伴。田地也出现了，它们因庄稼快要成熟了而正在发白。我还被指示这种庄稼的种子或谷粒，它们类似中国的小麦。我们又看到由这种谷粒做成的面包，尺寸很小，呈四方形。那里也有长满青草的平原，里面有鲜花，以及果实像石榴的树木；灌木也有，但不是葡萄树，所结的浆果可以酿酒。</p>

<p>166. I also saw their homes on that planet. They were long low houses, with windows on the sides corresponding to the number of rooms into which they were divided. The roof was rounded, and there were doors at each end. I was told that these were homes made of earth, with sod roofs and windows made of fine grass woven together in such a way that light could shine through. <sup>1</sup>
<p>I saw children, too; the spirits said that neighbors would come to visit especially for the sake of the children, so that they could play with other children under the watchful eye of the parents.
<p>I also saw fields that were turning white with grain almost ready for harvest. I was shown some seeds or grains of that harvest, which were like the grains of Chinese wheat. <sup>2</sup>I was also shown some bread made from it, which was small, in square pieces.
<p>In addition to this, I saw grassy fields with flowers there, as well as trees with fruits like pomegranates, and also bushes they had instead of grapevines that bore berries from which they made wine.

<p>1.&nbsp;For the rough sketch Swedenborg made of one of these houses in <a href="../se/4832.htm">Spiritual Experiences 4832:9</a>, see figure 4. Lang 2004, 35-36, points out the similarity between the drawing and an Algonquin longhouse. In <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10769.htm">Secrets of Heaven 10769</a>, Swedenborg adds the information that these houses are “in the form of the tents common among ancient peoples.” [SS]
<p>2.&nbsp;Swedenborg had a keen interest in the flora of other lands (Sigstedt 1981, 237-242) and may well have been acquainted with some of the varieties of wheat developed in China by his era. If such is his reference here, the distinctive nature of the grain may not be ascertainable. A conjecture can be made that he means rice; and if so, the description of the grain as “Chinese” is historically correct: most experts agree that the domestication of rice occurred in China over eight thousand years ago. However, rice was known in the ancient Mediterranean world, and there was a perfectly good Greek and Latin word for it, oryza, which Swedenborg could have used here if that was what he intended. Indeed, his failure to use it goes far toward ruling out the conjecture, particularly considering his thorough command of classical Latin and Neo-Latin vocabulary. Another conjecture is that he intended wheat that has been “puffed” by any of various processes. Puffed wheat is associated with China in certain Swedish names for such products today, but it is not clear how far back that association extends. [SÅH, SS, RS] </p>

<p>166. In addition I saw in that world their homes, which were low, long houses, with windows in the sides corresponding to the number of apartments or rooms into which they were divided. The roof was rounded, and there was a door at either end. They said that they were built of earth and roofed with turf. The windows were made of grass thread, so woven as to admit light. I also saw some children. They said their neighbours visited them, especially because of their children, so that they could enjoy the company of other children under the eyes and protection of their parents. 
<p>There were also fields to be seen which were turning white as the crop was almost ripe. I was shown the seeds or grain of that crop, which resembled the grains of Chinese wheat. <sup>1</sup>I was also shown loaves made from this, which were small, breaking up into four pieces. Grassy plains with flowers were also to be seen there, as well as trees with fruits like pomegranates. There were shrubs which, though not vines, bore berries from which they prepared wine.

<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 166</h4><p>166. Moreover, their dwellings on that earth were seen by me, and were long low houses, with windows on the sides according to the number of rooms or chambers into which they were divided. The roof was arched, and there was a door on each side at the end. They said that they were built of earth and roofed with sods, and the windows of threads of grass, so woven together that the light shone through. Children were also seen. And they said that their neighbors visited them, especially for the sake of their children, that they might be in company with other children, under the sight and auspices of their parents. There also appeared fields then whitening with the nearly ripened harvest. The seeds or grains of this harvest were shown, and they were like the grains of Chinese wheat. We were shown also loaves made of the grain, which were small in size and square in form. Moreover there also appeared grassy plains, with flowers therein, and trees with fruits similar to pomegranates; also shrubs, which were not vines, yet bearing berries from which wine is prepared. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 166 (original Latin)</h4><p>166. Praeterea in Tellure illa visa sunt eorum habitacula, quae erant Domus humiles in longum productae, cum fenestris a lateribus secundum numerum mansionum seu camerarum in quas erant divisae; tectum erat rotundum; et janua utrinque in extremitate; dicebant quod exstructae essent ex humo, et tectae cespitibus; et quod fenestrae ex filis gramineis, ita contextae, ut lux transpareret. Infantes quoque visi sunt; dicebant quod vicini ad illos veniant, imprimis propter infantes, ut in consortio sint cum infantibus aliis sub conspectu et auspicio parentum. Apparebant etiam agri tunc albescentes ex messe paene matura; ostensa sunt semina seu grana istius messis, quae similia erant granis tritici Chinensis: ostensi etiam sunt panes ex illis, qui parvi in frustis quadratis. Praeterea etiam apparebant campi graminei cum floribus ibi; et quoque arbores cum fructibus qui similes malogranatis; tum arbusta, quae non vites, sed usque ferentia baccas, ex quibus vinum praeparant. </p>
