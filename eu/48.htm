<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>48、他们说，他们在世时所住的星球人口众多，和这个星球所能供养的一样多。土地肥沃，出产丰富。但除了生活必需品外，人们并没有过多的欲求。他们看不到非必需品有什么用处，这就是为何木星人口如此众多。他们说，他们主要关心孩子的教育，并给予他们最温柔的爱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 48</h4>
<p>48. They told me that in the region of the planet where they had lived their earthly lives there were a great many people, as many as the land could feed. They said that the land was fertile and abundant in every way. In their world people desired no more than they needed for the necessities of life, and they saw no use in having more than that. That was why so great a population could be sustained there.
<p>They said that their greatest concern was for the raising of their children and that they loved their children most tenderly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 48</h4>
<p>48. They related that in the region of the planet where they lived while in the world there was a large population, as large as the planet could feed. The land was fertile and abounded in all kinds of produce. But people there did not wish for more than was necessary to live. They could not see the use of what was not necessary, and this was why the population was so large. They said that their chief concern was the bringing up of children, whom they loved most tenderly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 48</h4><p>48. They related that in the region of the earth where they had lived while in the world, the multitude of men therein was as great as the earth could support; that the earth was fertile, and it abounded in all things; and that there they did not desire more than the necessaries of life; that they accounted nothing useful but so far as it was necessary; and that hence the multitude of men was so great. They said that the education of their children was their greatest concern, and that they loved them most tenderly. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 48 (original Latin)</h4><p>48. Narrabant, quod in regione Telluris ubi illi vixerunt dum in mundo, magna multitudo hominum esset, quantam Tellus posset nutrire; quodque fertilis esset, et omnibus abundaret; et quod ibi non plus cuperent quam quantum ad necessitates vitae; et quae non ad necessitates, nec ad utilitates referrent; et quod inde multitudo hominum tam magna. Dicebant, quod cura illorum maxima esset educatio infantum, et quod illos tenerrime amarent. </p>
