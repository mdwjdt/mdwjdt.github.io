<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第51节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>51、我不仅能凭木星灵的靠近和流注的温柔和甜蜜，还能凭以下事实认出他们的同在：他们的流注尽可能地施加在我脸上，使我笑容满面、开朗愉快，并且在他们同在期间一直这样。他们说，当他们造访他们星球的居民，以这种方式想要赋予他们安宁和衷心的喜悦时，就会把这种愉快的表情传给他们。我能感觉到他们所赋予的安宁和喜悦充满我的胸腔和内心。它将造成干扰和烦忧，并使头脑充满各种情绪的对未来的欲望和焦虑一扫而空。我通过这种方式能确定木星居民过得是哪种生活。各个星球居民的性质从来自那里的灵人的性质就能得知，因为每个人死后都会保留自己的生活方式；当他成为一个灵人时，仍继续过着同样的生活。我发现，他们拥有祝福的状态，甚至拥有一种更为内在的幸福。我通过觉察到他们的内层没有向天堂关闭，而是打开而发现这一点；内层越向天堂打开，他们就越容易接受神的良善，这良善伴随着祝福和内在的幸福。那些不按天堂的次序生活的人则截然不同，他们的内层关闭，他们的外层则向尘世打开。</p>

<p>51. I could tell that spirits from Jupiter were present not only from the sweetness and gentleness of their approach and of their inflow but also from the fact that they flowed particularly into my face, making it cheerful and smiling the whole time they were with me. They said that they had this effect on the faces of the inhabitants of their planet when they visited them, to inspire a sense of peace and delight in their hearts. They inspired me with peace and delight as well; I could feel it filling my chest and my heart. It took away my cravings and my worries about the future, along with the restlessness and misery and emotional upheaval those feelings cause.
<p>This made it possible for me to see what life was like for the inhabitants of Jupiter. One can get to know the nature of a planet’s inhabitants from the spirits from that planet because we all bring with us the life we led in the physical world and go on living that same kind of life when we become spirits.
<p>I became aware that their state was one of blessedness, meaning profound inner happiness. I observed this because I was able to tell that their deeper levels were not closed off but were open toward heaven. The more open our deeper levels are toward heaven, the more open we are to receiving divine goodness; and blessedness and profound happiness come with that goodness. It is totally different for people who are not living within the design of heaven; <sup>1</sup>their deeper levels are closed, and their outer levels are open to this world.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;The Latin phrase ordo caelestis-literally, “heavenly order,” here translated “design of heaven”-is essentially synonymous with the simple term ordo, “order,” as well as with the term divinus ordo, “divine order,” both often translated “divine design.” These terms are used by Swedenborg to indicate the order of things established as proper by the Lord; that is, the order that will lead to the fulfillment of the Lord’s divine purposes. Examples of ordo caelestis in particular include <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/689.htm">Secrets of Heaven 689</a>, in which the phrase is used of the balance maintained by divine providence that effects the spontaneous punishment of evil; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3703#subsection.htm">Secrets of Heaven 3703:18</a>, in which it is used of a pattern of society found among those who live in heaven; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4302.htm">Secrets of Heaven 4302:3</a>, in which it is defined in a complex manner as the patterns taken by interrelated truth and goodness. For more on the divine design, see notes 4 in <a href="9.htm">9</a> and 1 in <a href="51.htm">51</a>. [SS] </p>

<p>51. I could recognise the presence of spirits from Jupiter not only by the gentleness and sweetness with which they arrived and made their influence felt, but also by the fact that their influence was exerted as much as possible on my face, making me look cheerful and smiling, for as long as they were present. They said that they do the same to the faces of the inhabitants of their world, when they visit them, wishing by this means to impart tranquillity and hearty joy. The tranquillity and joy they gave me I could feel filling my chest and heart. It took away the desires and anxieties about the future which cause disturbance and worry and fill the mind with varied emotions. 
<p>By this means I was able to establish what kind of life the inhabitants of Jupiter lead. The nature of the inhabitants can be known from that of the spirits, for each takes his own way of life with him from the world, and when he becomes a spirit lives in the same way. I noticed that they had a state of blessedness, an even more inward happiness. I noticed this by perceiving that their interiors were not closed to heaven, but open; and the more open to heaven one's interiors are, the easier it is for them to receive the goodness of God, which is accompanied by blessedness and inward happiness. It is quite different with those whose lives are not in accord with heaven's order, but have their interiors closed, and their exteriors open to the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 51</h4><p>51. I could distinguish the presence of the spirits of Jupiter, not only by the gentleness and sweetness of their approach and influx, but also from this, that for the most part their influx was into the face, and made it smiling and cheerful, and this continually during their presence. They said that they communicate a like cheerfulness of countenance to the inhabitants of their earth, when they come to them, being desirous thus to inspire them with tranquillity and delight of heart. That tranquillity and delight with which they inspired me filled my breast and heart very sensibly; at the same time cupidities and anxieties concerning things to come were removed, which cause unrest and undelightfulness, and excite various commotions in the mind. Hence it was evident to me what was the nature and quality of the life of the inhabitants of the earth Jupiter; for the disposition of the inhabitants of any earth may be known by the spirits who come thence, inasmuch as every one retains his own life after death, and continues to live it when he becomes a spirit. It was observed that they had a state of blessedness or happiness still more interior, which was manifest from this circumstance, that their interiors were perceived not to be closed, but open to heaven; for in proportion as the interiors are more open to heaven, in the same proportion they are the more susceptible of receiving Divine good, and with it blessedness and interior happiness. The case is altogether otherwise with those who do not live in the order of heaven: the interiors with such are closed, and the exteriors open to the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 51 (original Latin)</h4><p>51. Praesentiam Spirituum Jovialium non modo cognoscere potui ex allapsus et influxus lenitudine et suavitate, sed etiam ex eo quod influerent quam maxime in faciem, et illam disponerent hilarem et ridentem, et id continue dum aderant: dicebant, quod ita disponant facies incolarum telluris suae, cum ad illos veniunt, volentes sic eis inspirare tranquillitatem et jucunditatem cordis: tranquillitas et jucunditas illa, quae ab illis mihi inspirabatur, implebat sensibiliter thoracem et cor; removebantur tunc cupiditates et sollicitudines de futuris, quae intranquillum et injucundum inducunt, et animum in varios motus excitant. Inde constare mihi potuit, qualis vita Incolarum Telluris Jovis esset; ex spiritibus enim cognoscitur indoles incolarum, nam unusquisque vitam suam secum habet e mundo, ac vivit illam cum fit spiritus. Animadversum est quod illis esset status beatitudinis seu felicitatis adhuc interioris; hoc animadversum est per quod perceptum quod interiora eorum non clausa essent sed aperta ad coelum; quo enim apertiora ad coelum sunt interiora, eo sunt susceptibiliora recipiendi divinum Bonum, et cum illo beatitudinem ac interiorem felicitatem: aliter prorsus apud illos, qui non in ordine coeli vivunt, apud eos interiora clausa sunt, et exteriora aperta ad mundum. </p>
