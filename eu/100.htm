<p>100. They said that there are some people on their planet who refer to the light they have at night (which is bright) as “the Lord,” but these people are kept apart from the other inhabitants and are not tolerated by them. The light at night there comes from the great ring that surrounds their planet at some distance and from the satellites that are called Saturn’s moons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 100</h4>
<p>100. They said there were some people in their world who call their nocturnal luminary, which is vast, the Lord. But these are kept apart from the rest and are not tolerated by them. Their nocturnal illumination comes from the great ring which surrounds their world at a distance, and from the moons we know as the satellites of Saturn. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 100</h4><p>100. They said that on their earth there are also some who call the nocturnal light, which is great, the Lord; but that they are separated from the rest, and are not tolerated by them. That nocturnal light comes from the great belt, which at a distance encompasses that earth, and from the moons which are called Saturn's satellites. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 100 (original Latin)</h4><p>100. Dicebant quod in Tellure sua etiam sint, qui Lumen nocturnum, quod magnum est, vocant Dominum, sed quod illi separentur a reliquis, et ab illis non tolerentur. Lumen illud nocturnum venit a magno illo Cingulo, quod ad distantiam ambit Tellurem illam, et a Lunis, quae satellites Saturni vocantur. </p>
