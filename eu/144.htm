<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第144节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>144、当进一步被问及他们的星球时，他们说，他们有草地、花园、满是果树的树林，以及湖泊，湖里有鱼；还有带金翅膀的蓝鸟，大大小小的动物。在小型动物当中，他们提到了一种背部隆起的动物，很像我们地球上的骆驼。然而，他们不吃这些动物的肉，只吃鱼肉，以及树上的果实和地上的蔬菜。他们继续说，他们不住在建成的房子里，而是住在小树林里；他们在那里用树叶做屋顶，以遮雨避暑。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 144</h4>
<p>144. In response to further questions about their planet, they said that they had meadows, flower gardens, woods full of fruit trees, and lakes with fish in them; also blue-colored birds with golden wings, and animals large and small. They mentioned that one of their smaller animals is humpbacked, like the camels on our planet. The only meat they eat, however, is fish. They also eat fruit from their trees and vegetables from their soil.
<p>They said they did not live in human-built houses but in groves where they made roofs for themselves among the branches as protection from the rain and from the heat of the sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 144</h4>
<p>144. Asked further about their world they said it contained meadows, flower-gardens and woods full of fruit-bearing trees, as well as lakes with fish in them. There are blue-coloured birds with golden feathers, and animals both large and small. Among the smaller ones they mentioned some which have a raised back like camels in our world. However, they did not eat their flesh, but only that of fish, together with fruit from the trees and vegetables from the earth. They went on to say that they did not build houses to live in, but lived in woodland, where they made roofs among the leaves to shelter from rain and the heat of the sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 144</h4><p>144. Being questioned further about their earth, they said that they have meadows, flower gardens, woods full of fruit trees, and also lakes in which are fish; and that they have birds of a blue color with golden wings, and animals of various sizes. Among the smaller they mentioned one kind which had the back humped, like the camels on our earth. They do not, however, eat the flesh of these animals, but only the flesh of fishes, and also the fruits of trees and leguminous plants of the earth. They said further that they do not dwell in built houses, but in groves, in which they make a shelter for themselves among the foliage against rain and the heat of the sun. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 144 (original Latin)</h4><p>144. Porro interrogati de Tellure sua dicebant, quod illis prata sint, floreta, sylvae plenae arboribus fructiferis, et quoque lacus in quibus pisces; quodque aves coloris caerulei cum aureis pennis; et quod animalia majora et minora; inter minora memorabant, quae dorsum elevatum instar camelorum in nostra Tellure haberent; et tamen quod non vescantur carne eorum sed solum carne piscium; et praeterea fructibus ex arboribus, et leguminibus ex terra. Dicebant porro, quod non habitent in exstructis domibus, sed in Lucis, in quibus inter frondes faciunt sibi tecta pro imbre et pro aestu solis. </p>
