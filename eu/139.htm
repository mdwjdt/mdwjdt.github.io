<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第139节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>139、我到了那里后，没有看见这个星球，只看到来自该星球的灵人。如前所述，每个星球的灵人都出现在他们自己星球的附近，因为他们与生活在那里的居民秉性相似。他们来自这些居民，在那里能为他们提供服务。只见这些灵人在我头顶上相当高的地方，他们从那里俯视我的到来。要知道，在来世，站在高处的人能看见在他们之下的人；他们越高，其视野就越宽广。他们不仅能看到他们，还能与他们交谈。他们从自己的位置发现我并非来自他们的星球，而是来自某个遥远的地方。于是，他们从那里向我说话，询问各种事；对于他们的问题，我都可以回答。除此之外，我还告诉他们我来自哪个星球，该星球是何性质。后来，我与他们谈论我们太阳系中的其它星球，还告诉他们有关水星灵的情况，他们如何到众多星球旅行，以便获得各种各样的知识。闻听此言，他们说，在一次造访中，他们也见过这些灵人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 139</h4>
<p>139. When I got there I did not see the planet itself, but I did see some spirits from it, since as already noted [<a href="127.htm">127</a>] the spirits of any planet can be seen in its vicinity. This is because they have a nature similar to that of the planet’s inhabitants, they once lived there themselves, and the current inhabitants need their help.
<p>I saw these spirits fairly high above my head, and from there they saw me clearly as I arrived. It is important to know that in the other life people who are located on high can clearly see people who are below them, and the higher they are, the wider their view; and they can not only see people but communicate with them as well.
<p>They observed that I was not from their planet but from somewhere quite remote; so they addressed me from where they were, asking me various questions to which I was allowed to respond. I told them among other things what planet I was from and what it was like; and later I told them about other planets in our solar system. I included a mention of the spirits from Mercury who travel around to many other planets gaining knowledge for themselves about various things. When they heard this, they said that they too had been visited by them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 139</h4>
<p>139. On my arrival there I did not see the world, but I saw spirits from it. For, as I said before, the spirits of each world are to be seen around their own world, because their characters resemble those of the people who live there. They have come from them, and are there to be of service to them. These spirits were seen very high overhead, and from that position they could watch my arrival. It should be known that in the next life those who stand on high can watch those below them; and the higher they are the wider their field of vision. They can not only watch them, but also talk with them. 
<p>They noticed from their position that I was not from their world, but from some distant place. So they spoke to me from there, asking about various matters; and I was able to reply to their questions. Amongst other things I told them which world I was from and what it was like. Afterwards I told them about the planets in our solar system. I also told them about the spirits of the world or planet of Mercury, and how they travel to many worlds in order to acquire knowledge of various matters. On hearing this they said that they too had seen them on a visit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 139</h4><p>139. When I arrived thither, the earth was not seen, but only the spirits who were from that earth; for, as also was said above, the spirits of every earth appear about their own earth, by reason that they are of a genius similar to that of the inhabitants, for they are from them, and in order that they may serve them. Those spirits were seen at a considerable height above my head whence they observed me as I approached. It is to be known that they who stand on high in the other life can look at those who are beneath them, and the higher they are the greater is the extent of their vision; and they can not only look at them, but likewise can speak with them. From their state of elevation they observed that I was not from their earth, but from another afar off; wherefore they addressed me inquiring concerning various things, to which it was given me to reply; and among other things I related to them from what earth I was, and what kind of earth it was. Afterwards I spoke to them concerning the other earths in our solar system; and at the same time also concerning the spirits of the earth or planet Mercury, that they wander about to many earths for the purpose of procuring for themselves knowledges of various matters. On hearing this, they said that they had likewise seen those spirits with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 139 (original Latin)</h4><p>139. Quando illuc perventum est, non visa est Tellus, sed visi Spiritus ex illa Tellure; nam, ut prius quoque dictum, Spiritus cujusvis Telluris apparent circa suam Tellurem, ex causa quia simili genio sunt cum indigenis, nam ex illis sunt, utque inserviant illis. Visi sunt spiritus illi admodum alte supra caput, et inde me pervenientem perspexerunt: sciendum, quod qui in altera vita in alto stant, perspicere possint illos qui infra sunt, et quo in altiori, eo latius, et quod non modo possint perspicere illos, sed etiam loqui cum illis. Observabant inde, quod non ex eorum Tellure essem, sed e longinquo aliunde; quapropter me inde alloquuti sunt, interrogando de variis, ad quae etiam respondere datum est; et inter alia narrabam illis ex qua Tellure essem, et qualis ea esset: et postea dicebam de Telluribus in Mundo nostro solari: et tunc quoque de spiritibus Telluris seu Planetae Mercurii, quod illi pervagentur ad plures Tellures ad comparandas sibi cognitiones rerum variarum; cum id audiebant, dicebant quod etiam illos apud se viderint. </p>
