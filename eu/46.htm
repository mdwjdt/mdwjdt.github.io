<p>46. The Planet Jupiter and Its Spirits and Inhabitants
<p>I have been allowed to interact with the spirits and angels from Jupiter over a longer period than with spirits and angels from other planets, so I can report more about their state of life and the state of their planet’s inhabitants. There have been a number of indications that this is where these spirits came from, and I have been told so by a heavenly source as well. </p>

<p>46. III. ON THE WORLD OR PLANET JUPITER, AND ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS 
<p>I was allowed to associate for a longer period with the spirits and angels of the planet Jupiter than with those from the other planets. I have therefore more to report about the way they and the inhabitants of that planet live. I had many indications, and it was told me from heaven, that these spirits were from that place. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 46</h4><p>46. THE EARTH OR PLANET JUPITER, ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS. <p>It was granted me to enjoy longer interaction with the spirits and angels of the planet Jupiter, than with the spirits and angels from the rest of the planets; wherefore I am at liberty to relate more concerning the state of their life, and of the inhabitants of that planet. That those spirits were from that planet was evident from many things, and it was also declared from heaven. </p>

DE TELLURE SEU PLANETA JOVIS, DEQUE EJUS SPIRITIBUS et INCOLIS.<p>Cum Spiritibus et Angelis Planetae Jovis diutius sociare commercium datum est, quam cum Spiritibus et Angelis qui ex reliquis Planetis, quapropter de statu vitae illorum ac incolarum illius Planetae plura memorare licet. Quod inde Spiritus illi fuerint, patuit a multis, et quoque dictum e coelo. </p>
