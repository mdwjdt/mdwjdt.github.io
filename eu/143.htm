<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第143节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>143、出现在高处的灵人被问及在他们的星球，人们是否受君王或国王的统治。对此，他们的答复是，他们不知道什么是国王，而是自我管理，分成民族、家族和家庭。当被问及这样生活是否安全时，他们说，他们很安全，因为这个家庭从来不嫉妒那个家庭，或想从他们那里得到什么。他们对这样的问题感到恼火，好像暗示他们当中有仇敌，需要采取防范措施对付强盗。他们问，除了衣食，因而在自我管理之下知足、平安地生活外，人还需要什么？</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 143</h4>
<p>143. I asked the spirits overhead whether on their planet they lived under the dominion of rulers and monarchs. They replied that they did not even know what that meant. They live on their own, distinguished into peoples, extended families, and individual households. Asked whether it was safe for them to live that way, they said that it was, because there was nothing one extended family had that another family envied or wanted to take away. In fact, it bothered them that I asked, as though I were implying they were hostile to each other or needed protection from thieves. What more did they need, they insisted, than to have food and clothing and to live quietly and contentedly on their own? </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 143</h4>
<p>143. The spirits who were seen at a height were asked whether in their world people lived under the rule of princes or kings. Their reply to this was that they did not know what kingdoms were, but that they lived under their own government, divided into clans, families and households. Asked whether they were safe living like that, they said they were, since one family never envied another or wanted to take anything from them. They were annoyed at such questions, as if they were being accused of having enemies or taking precautions against robbers. What more does anyone need, they asked, than to have food and clothing, and so to live contented and in peace under one's own government? </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 143</h4><p>143. The spirits who were seen on high were asked whether on their earth they live under the rule of princes and kings; to which they answered that they do not know what such rule is; and that they live under themselves, distinguished into nations, families, and houses. They were asked whether they are secure in this way. They said that they are, since one family does not envy another, nor wish to take anything away from it. They were indignant at being asked such questions, which seemed to imply that there was hostility among them, or need of protection against robbers. What more is needed, they said, than to have food and clothing, and so to dwell contented and quiet under themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 143 (original Latin)</h4><p>143. Quaerebantur spiritus, qui ex alto visi sunt, num in Tellure vivant sub imperiis Principum aut Regum; ad haec respondebant, quod nesciant quid imperia, et quod vivant sub se, distincti in gentes, familias, et domos: quaerebantur, num sic securi, dicebant quod securi, quoniam una familia alteri nihil invidet, et nihil derogare vult; indignati quod talia quaererentur, sicut insimularentur hostilitatis, aut alicujus tutelae contra praedones; quid magis opus est, ajebant, quam habere victum et amictum, et sic contenti et quieti sub se habitare. </p>
