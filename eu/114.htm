<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第114节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>114、主要原因是为了圣言。这是因为圣言是神性真理本身，神性真理教导我们有一位神，一个天堂和一个地狱，以及死后的生命；还教导我们当如何生活、当相信什么才能使我们进入天堂，从而进入永恒的幸福。若没有一个启示，因而在这个星球没有圣言，所有这些事完全不为人知。然而，人如此被造，以致就其内在而言，他不可能死亡。仅凭属世之光，无从知道有关主、天堂与地狱、人死后的生活方式，以及作为人获得属灵和永恒生命手段的神性真理的任何事(AC 8944, 10318-10320)。这一点可从以下事实被证实：许多人，包括有学问的人，都不相信它们，尽管他们出生在有圣言的地方，并且在那里通过圣言接受过有关这些事的教导(AC 10319)。因此，有必要从天上得到启示，因为人类生来注定上天堂(AC 1775)。</p>

<p>114. The main reason was for the sake of the Word because the Word is the divine truth itself that teaches humankind that God exists, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death. It also teaches how we must live and what we must believe if we are to come into heaven and live in happiness forever. All this would have been utterly unknown if there had been no revelation-which means, in the case of our planet, if there had been no Word-and yet with respect to our inner natures we have been created in such a way that we cannot die. <sup>1</sup>
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;[Swedenborg note] From earthly light alone, we know nothing about the Lord, heaven and hell, our life after death, or the divine truths that are essential for our spiritual and eternal life: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8944.htm">8944</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10318.htm">10318</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10319.htm">10319</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10320.htm">10320</a>. Evidence for this is the fact that many people, including scholars, do not believe in these things even though they were born where the Word is present and have been taught from it about these matters: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10319.htm">10319</a>. That is why it became necessary for there to be a revelation from heaven, since we are born for heaven: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1775.htm">1775</a>. </p>

<p>114. The chief cause was for the sake of the Word. This is because the Word is Divine truth itself, which teaches us that there is a God, a heaven and a hell, and life after death; it also teaches us how to live and what to believe, to enable us to reach heaven and so to be happy for ever. All of these points would be totally unknown without a revelation, which in this world means without the Word. Yet man was created in such a way that he could not die, as far as his interiors are concerned. <sup>1</sup>

<p>1.&nbsp;Natural light by itself cannot yield any knowledge about the Lord, heaven and hell, how people live after death, or about Divine truths, which are a person's means of achieving spiritual and everlasting life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8944.htm">Arcana Caelestia 8944</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10318.htm">10318-10320</a>). This can be established from the fact that many people, including the educated, do not believe in them, despite being born where the Word is known, and having been taught by it about these subjects (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10319.htm">Arcana Caelestia 10319</a>). It was therefore necessary for a revelation to be made from heaven, since human beings are by birth destined for heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1775.htm">Arcana Caelestia 1775</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 114</h4><p>114. That the principal reason was because of the Word, is because the Word is the Divine truth itself, which teaches man that there is a God, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death; and teaches moreover how man ought to live and believe, in order to come into heaven, and thus into eternal happiness. All these things would have been altogether unknown without a revelation, thus on this earth without the Word; and yet man is so created that, as to his interiors, he cannot die. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;From natural light alone nothing is known concerning the Lord, concerning heaven and hell, concerning the life of man after death, and concerning Divine truths, by which man has spiritual and eternal life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8944.htm">Arcana Coelestia 8944</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10318.htm">10318-10320</a>). This may appear from this, that many, and among them the learned, do not believe those things, although they are born where the Word is, and where there is instruction by the Word concerning those things (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/10319.htm">Arcana Coelestia 10319</a>). Therefore it was necessary there should be a revelation from heaven, because man was born for heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1775.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1775</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 114 (original Latin)</h4><p>114. Quod Causa principalis fuerit propter Verbum, est quia Verbum est ipsum divinum Verum, quod docet hominem, quod Deus sit, quod Coelum sit et quod Infernum, quod vita post mortem; et insuper docet, quomodo vivet et credet, ut in coelum veniat, et sic in aeternum felix sit. Haec omnia absque Revelatione, ita in hac Tellure absque Verbo, prorsus ignota fuissent, et tamen homo ita creatus est, ut quoad interiora sua non mori possit. <sup>1</sup><p> <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Quod ex solo lumine naturali nihil sciatur de Domino, de Coelo et Inferno, de vita hominis post mortem, ac de divinis Veris, per quae homini vita spiritualiset aeterna, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_114/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_8944" target=_top>Arcana Coelestia 8944</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_114/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10318" target=_top>10318</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_114/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10319" target=_top>10319</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-telluribus_114/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_10320" target=_top>10320</a>.
