<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第99节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>99、他们说，有时我们地球灵也会造访他们，并问他们拜的是什么神。他们的答复是，问这个问题的人一定是疯了，没有比问某人拜的是什么神更疯狂的了，因为对所有人来说，宇宙之中只有一位独一神；不承认主是那独一神，祂掌管整个天堂，并由此掌管整个世界的人甚至更疯狂。事实上，掌管天堂者，也必掌管世界，因为世界是通过天堂来掌管的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 99</h4>
<p>99. They said that sometimes spirits from our planet come to them and ask what God they worship. They reply that the ones posing this question must be crazy. There could be nothing more insane than to ask what God someone worships when there is only one God for everyone in the universe; and they are even more insane for not saying that the Lord is that only God. He rules the whole heaven and therefore also rules the whole world; whoever rules heaven also rules the world because the world is ruled through heaven. <sup>1</sup>

<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 99</h4>
<p>99. They related that sometimes they are visited by spirits from our world, who ask them what God they worship. Their reply is that their questioners must be mad, and there can be no greater madness than to ask what God anyone worships, seeing that there is one sole God for all in the universe; and it is even more madness not to say that the Lord is that sole God, who controls the whole heaven and so the whole world. For the controller of heaven is also the controller of the world, since the world is controlled by means of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 99</h4><p>99. They said that sometimes spirits from our earth come to them, and ask them what God they worship; to whom they reply, that they are insane, and that there cannot be a greater proof of insanity than to ask what God any one worships, when there is but one only God for all in the universe; and that they are still more insane in this, that they do not acknowledge the Lord to be that one only God, and that He rules the entire heaven, and thereby the whole world; for whosoever rules heaven also rules the world, inasmuch as the world is ruled through heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 99 (original Latin)</h4><p>99. Dicebant, quod aliquoties ad illos veniant spiritus a nostra Tellure, qui eos quaerunt, quem Deum colunt, quibus respondent, quod insaniant, et quod major insania non possit esse quam quaerere quem Deum aliquis colit, cum tamen est unicus Deus omnibus in universo, et quod adhuc magis insaniant in eo, quod non dicant Dominum esse unicum illum Deum; et quod is regat universum coelum, et inde universum mundum; nam qui regit coelum, etiam regit mundum, quia mundus regitur per coelum. </p>
