<p>138. A Second Extrasolar Planet and Its Spirits and Inhabitants
<p>Later on, I was taken by the Lord to a planet out in space that was farther from our planet than the first one, the one just discussed. I could tell it was farther away because it took my spirit two whole days to be led there. This planet was to the left, while the former one was to the right.
<p>As I said before [<a href="125.htm">125</a>, <a href="127.htm">127</a>, <a href="135.htm">135</a>], remoteness in the spiritual world arises not from distance between locations but from a difference in state. Therefore I could tell from the slowness of my trip there-two days-that the inner state of its spirits (the state of their feelings and consequent thoughts) was significantly different from the inner state of the spirits of our planet.
<p>Since I was taken there in spirit by changes in my inner state, I had a chance to observe the actual changes as they followed one another until I arrived. This happened while I was awake. </p>

<p>138. XI. THE SECOND WORLD IN THE STARRY SKY, AND ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS 
<p>Afterwards I was brought by the Lord to a world in space, which was even further away from our world than the first one I have described. It became plain that it was more distant, because the journey to it in my spirit lasted two days. This world lay to the left, the previous one to the right. Remoteness in the spiritual world does not depend on spatial distance, but on difference of state, as was said above. I was therefore able to deduce from the time the journey to it took, two whole days, that the state of the interiors affecting people there, that is, the state of their affections and consequently of their thoughts, is so very different from those affecting spirits from our world. Since I was transported there by changes of interior state, I was able to observe the successive changes as they happened up to my arrival. This took place while I was awake. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 138</h4><p>138. A SECOND EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN, ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS. <p>I was afterwards led by the Lord to an earth in the universe which was further distant from our earth than the foregoing of which we have been just speaking. That it was further distant was plain from this, that I was two days in being led thither as to my spirit. This earth was to the left, whereas the former was to the right. Inasmuch as remoteness in the spiritual world does not arise from distance of place, but from difference of state, as was said above, therefore from the slowness of my progression thither, which lasted two days, I might conclude that the state of the interiors with them, which is the state of the affections and thence of the thoughts, differed proportionately from the state of the interiors with spirits from our earth. Being conveyed thither as to the spirit by changes of the state of the interiors, I was enabled to observe the successive changes themselves before I arrived thither. This was done whilst I was awake. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 138 (original Latin)</h4><p>138. DE SECUNDA TELLURE IN COELO ASTRIFERO, et DE EJUS SPIRITIBUS et INCOLIS<p>Postea ductus sum a Domino ad Tellurem in Universo, quae distabat a nostra Tellure longinquius quam prima illa, de qua nunc actum est; quod distaret longinquius, patescebat ex eo, quod illuc quoad spiritum meum perductus sim per binos dies: erat illa Tellus ad sinistrum, prior autem ad dextrum. Quia longinquitas in mundo spirituali non est ex distantia loci, sed ex differentia status, ut supra dictum est, quapropter ex mora progressionis illuc, quae erat duorum dierum, concludere potui, quod status interiorum apud illos, qui est status affectionum et inde cogitationum, tantum differret a statu interiorum, qui est apud spiritus e nostra Tellure. Quoniam perlatus sum illuc quoad spiritum per mutationes status interiorum, datum est observare ipsas mutationes successivas, antequam illuc perventum est. Factum est hoc cum vigil eram. </p>
