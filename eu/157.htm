<p>157. A Fourth Extrasolar Planet and Its Spirits and Inhabitants
<p>I was taken to yet another planet out in space beyond our solar system, a journey accomplished by changes in the state of my mind and therefore with regard to my spirit. As I have already said several times [125, 127, 135], the only way spirits can be taken from place to place is by changes in their inner state. To the spirits themselves, these changes look exactly like going from place to place, like traveling. I experienced changes like this steadily for about ten hours until I had left behind my own state of life and had come into theirs, meaning that I arrived there in spirit.
<p>Along the way I was taken eastward, toward the left, and seemed to be gradually lifted up above the horizontal plane. I was also able to observe quite clearly a progress and motion away from my former location, even to the point that I could no longer see the people I had left behind. While this was going on, some spirits were accompanying me, and I talked with them about various matters.
<p>One of the spirits who was with us had been a church leader during his earthly life, and also a deeply moving preacher and writer. My companion spirits gathered from my own image of him that he was at heart more of a Christian than others, since in the world we form our image of others and judge them on the basis of what they preach and write and not on the basis of how they live their life, if this is not known to us. But even if something in their life were to seem inconsistent with their message, we would overlook it anyway. This is because our image of others, what we already think and feel about them, always colors any new information we receive about them. </p>

<p>157. XIII. THE FOURTH WORLD IN THE STARRY SKY AND ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS 
<p>I was taken to yet another world in space outside the solar system; this was brought about by changes in my mental state, changes, that is, affecting my spirit. For, as I have said several times before, a spirit is taken from place to place by nothing but changes in his inner state. These changes seem to him exactly like movement from one place to another or travelling. It took around ten hours of continuous changes for me to reach their state of life from my own, so for me to travel there in my spirit. I was travelling eastwards, towards the left, and I seemed to be gradually climbing above the horizontal plane. I was also able to watch clearly my progress and advance from my previous position, until at length those I had left behind disappeared from view. Meanwhile I conversed on various subjects with the spirits accompanying me. 
<p>We had with us a certain spirit who during his life in the world had been a most impassioned prelate and preacher as well as writer. My spirit companions thought from my idea of him that he must be an outstanding Christian at heart. For in the world an idea is formed and a judgment made based on a person's preaching and writings, rather than on his life, if this is not manifest; and if there seems to be anything discordant in his life, excuses are offered. For the idea formed, one's thought and perception about anyone, puts a favourable gloss on everything about him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 157</h4><p>157. A FOURTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN, ITS SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS. <p>I was conducted to still another earth in the universe beyond our solar system, which was effected by changes of the state of my mind, and thus as to the spirit. For, as has been sometimes said before, the spirit is conducted from place to place in no other way than by changes of the state of its interiors, which changes appear to it altogether like movements from place to place, or like journeyings. These changes lasted continuously for about ten hours, before from the state of my life I arrived at the state of their life; thus before I was brought thither as to my spirit. I was borne toward the east to the left, and I seemed to be sensibly elevated above the plane of the horizon. It was also given me to observe very clearly the progression and advance from the place where I had been before, until at length those from whom I departed were no longer in sight. Meanwhile I spoke on various subjects with the spirits who went with me. A certain spirit was also with us, who when he lived in the world had been a primate and a preacher, and likewise a very pathetic writer. From my idea of him the accompanying spirits supposed that in heart he must be eminently a Christian. For in the world an idea is received and a judgment formed from one's preaching and writings, and not from his life, unless this is conspicuous; and if there appears anything inconsistent in his life, still it is excused; for the idea, or the thought and perception concerning any one, draws everything to its own side. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 157 (original Latin)</h4><p>157. DE QUARTA TELLURE IN COELO ASTRIFERO, DEQUE EJUS SPIRITIBUS et INCOLIS<p>Perductus sum adhuc ad aliam Tellurem quae in Universo extra Mundum nostrum Solarem, quod factum est per mutationes status mentis meae, ita quoad spiritum; nam, ut prius aliquoties dictum est, spiritus non aliter perducitur e loco in locum quam per mutationes status interiorum ejus, quae mutationes apparent ei prorsus sicut promotiones e loco in locum seu sicut profectiones: perstabant illae mutationes continue per decem horas circiter, antequam pervenirem a statu vitae meae ad statum vitae illorum; ita antequam quoad spiritum meum illuc productus sum. Ferebar versus orientem, sinistrorsum, et videbar sensim elevari a plano horizontali: etiam observare dabatur perspicue progressionem et promotionem a priori loco, usque tandem ut non apparerent amplius illi a quibus discessi: ac interea cum spiritibus, qui una mecum erant, de variis loquutus sum. Quidam Spiritus etiam nobiscum erat, qui dum in mundo vixit, Antistes et Praedicator fuerat, et quoque Scriptor valde patheticus: ex idea de illo in me putabant spiritus comites, illum fore Christianum corde prae reliquis; nam in mundo capitur idea, et judicatur ex praedicatione et scriptis, et non ex vita si haec non exstat, et si aliquid vitae non concordantis apparet, usque excusatur; nam idea seu cogitatio et perceptio de aliquo trahit omnia in partes sui. </p>
