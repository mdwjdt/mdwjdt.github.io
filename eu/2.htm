<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第2节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>2、有许多星球上面有人类居住，并且有些灵人和天使就出自他们，这在来世是众所周知的事。因为在来世，凡其渴望出于对真理、因而对功用的热爱之人都被允许与来自其它星球的灵人交谈，由此确认世界的多样化。他以此方式获知：人类并非仅仅来自一个星球，而是来自无数星球；还能获知这些人的秉性、生活方式，以及他们的神性敬拜。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 2</h4>
<p>2. In the other life it is common knowledge that there are many planets with people on them and consequently spirits and angels from them. If a love of truth and therefore some useful reason prompts people there to want to talk with spirits from other worlds, they are all allowed to do so. This assures them that there is indeed a plurality of worlds and informs them that humankind exists on not just one earth but countless planets. It teaches them also about the character and life of these people, and about their worship of God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 2</h4>
<p>2. It is a very well-known fact in the next life that there are many worlds inhabited by human beings, and there are spirits and angels who have come from them. Anyone there, whose desire springs from a love of truth and the purpose it can serve, is permitted to talk with spirits from other worlds, so as to get proof of the multiplicity of worlds. He can thus learn that the human race does not come from only one world, but from countless worlds; and moreover what these peoples' character is and how they live, and what sort of religious worship they practise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 2</h4><p>2. That there are many earths, and men upon them, and spirits and angels thence, is well known in the other life, for it is there granted to every one who desires it from a love of truth, and thence of use, to speak with the spirits of other earths, and thereby to be confirmed concerning a plurality of worlds, and to be informed that the human race is not from one earth only, but from innumerable earths; and moreover to be informed what is their genius, manner of life, and their Divine worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 2 (original Latin)</h4><p>2. Quod plures Tellures sint, et super illis homines, et inde spiritus et angeli, notissimum est in altera vita, nam cuivis ibi, qui ex amore veri et inde usus desiderat, cum spiritibus aliarum Tellurum loqui conceditur, et inde confirmari de pluralitate mundorum, ac informari, quod Genus humanum non solum ex una Tellure sit, sed ex innumeris; et insuper quali genio et vita sunt; et qualis cultus eorum divinus. </p>
