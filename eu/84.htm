<h3 align="center" class="ired">《宇宙星球》 第84节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>84、我看到一个秃头，不过只看到它的顶部，就是头顶骨；我听说，那些一年内就要死去的人就会看到这种异象，于是他们便做好准备。木星人并不害怕死亡，只怕离开妻子，孩子或父母；因为他们知道自己死后仍继续活着。他们知道自己不会丧命，因为他们就要上天堂了。所以，他们不将其称为死去，而是称为变成天堂。在木星，那些生活在真正的婚姻之爱中，并如父母所应该的那样照顾自己的孩子之人不会死于疾病，而是平平安安，好像睡着了；就这样从这个世界转到天堂。</p><p>按我们地球上的年龄来算的话，木星人死亡时的年龄是三十岁。他们在这么短的时间内死去，是出于主的旨意，以免人口增长过多，超出这个星球所能承受的。他们到了这个年龄后，就不肯像那些还没有到这个年龄的人那样被灵人和天使引导；因此，灵人和天使很少靠近那些年纪大的人。他们发育成熟的速度远比我们地球人快得多，并且在刚成年，即青春萌动时就结婚。然后，他们的快乐就是爱自己的妻子或丈夫，照顾自己的孩子。诚然，他们也将其它快乐称为快乐，但相对来说都是外在的快乐。</p>

<h4 align="center">Other Planets (New Century Edition 2020) 84</h4>
<p>84. I saw a vision of a bald head, but only the top of it, which was bony; and I was told that the people on Jupiter who were going to die within a year saw a vision of this kind and then made their preparations. They have no fear of death there except as it involves leaving their spouses or children or parents, because they know that they will go on living after death; they are not leaving life, they are going to heaven. So they do not call dying “dying,” but “being heavenized.” <sup>1</sup>As for the ones from that planet who have lived in true marriage love and have cared for their children as parents should, they do not die of illnesses but die peacefully, as if they were merely falling asleep. That is how they cross over from the world into heaven.</p>
<p>[2] Their usual lifespan is thirty years, going by our years. In the Lord’s providence, they die after this short time to prevent the number of people there from rising beyond what that planet can support. Another reason is that once they have reached that age they no longer allow themselves to be led by spirits and angels the way the younger inhabitants do. As a result spirits and angels are rarely present with the older inhabitants. Then too, the people there mature more quickly than people on our planet do. They get married in the first flower of youth, and then their greatest joy is to love their spouse and care for their children. There are other things they call joys, but these are superficial by comparison.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;The Latin word here translated “being heavenized” is coelificari, a nonce combination of the words for “heaven” (coelum) and “to make” (facere). [GFD] </p>
<h4 align="center">Worlds in Space (Chadwick translation 1997) 84</h4>
<p>84. I saw a bald head, but only its upper, bony part; and I was told that those who are due to die within a year see such a vision, and they then prepare themselves. The people there are not afraid of dying, apart from having to leave their wife, children or parents, because they know they will go on living after death. They know they are not leaving life, because they are going to heaven; so they do not call it dying, but becoming heavenly. If in that world they have lived in a state of truly conjugial love and have taken care of their children as parents should, they do not die of disease, but peacefully as if in sleep; and so they pass from that world to heaven.</p>
<p>[2] The average age of people there at death is thirty, counting by the years of this world. The reason why they die within such a short span of time is that the Lord's Providence ensures that the population does not exceed the numbers who can be supported by that world. It is also because after reaching that age, they resist the guidance of spirits and angels, which those who have not yet reached that age accept, so that spirits and angels rarely approach those who are older. They reach maturity more quickly than people in our world, and get married in the first flush of youth. Their delights then are to love their wife or husband, and to take care of their children. Their other delights they admittedly call delights, but comparatively external ones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 84</h4><p>84. There appeared to me a bald head, but only the top of it, which was bony; and it was said that those who are to die within a year see such a one, and that they then prepare themselves. They do not fear death there, except on account of leaving the consort, children or parents; for they know that they will live after death, and that they are not going out of life, because they are going into heaven. Therefore they do not call it dying, but being heaven-made. Those who have lived in love truly conjugial on that earth, and have taken care of their children as becomes parents, do not die of diseases, but tranquilly as in sleep; and thus they migrate from the world into heaven. The age of men there is usually thirty years, according to the years of our earth. The cause of their dying in so short a time is of the Lord's providence, lest the multitude of men should increase beyond what can be sustained by that earth; and because after they have fulfilled those years, they do not suffer themselves to be led by spirits and angels as those do who have not yet fulfilled them; for which reason spirits and angels rarely go to the more mature. They come to maturity also more quickly than on our earth. Even in the first flower of youth they form marriages, and then their delights are to love the consort, and to take care of their children. Other delights they indeed call delights, but respectively external. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 84 (original Latin)</h4><p>84. Visum est mihi Calvitium, sed modo suprema ejus pars, quae ossea; et dicebatur, quod tale videant illi, qui intra annum morituri sunt, et quod tunc se praeparent. Ibi mortem non timent, nisi propter quod relinquant conjugem, liberos, aut parentes, nam sciunt quod post mortem victuri sint; et quod e vita non abeant quia in coelum; quapropter mori non vocant mori, sed coelificari. Qui in illa tellure vixerunt in amore vere conjugiali, et curam liberorum, sicut parentes decet, habuerunt, illi non moriuntur per morbos, sed tranquille sicut in somno; ac ita transmigrant e mundo in coelum. Aetas hominum ibi ut plurimum est triginta annorum, secundum annos nostrae telluris: causa quod intra spatium temporis tam breve moriantur, est ex Providentia Domini, ne copia hominum ibi crescat ultra numerum quam qui a tellure illa sustentari possit; et quia postquam impleverunt illos annos, non patiuntur se duci per spiritus et angelos, sicut qui nondum impleverunt, quapropter spiritus et angeli raro adultiores adeant; maturescunt etiam citius quam in nostra tellure; etiam in primo flore juventutis sociant conjugia; et tunc illorum delitiae sunt amare conjugem, et curam liberorum habere; caeteras delitias quidem delitias vocant, sed respective externas. </p>
