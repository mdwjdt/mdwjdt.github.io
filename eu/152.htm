<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>152、他们继续说，其星球的居民并不住在高处，而是住在地上的矮屋里。这是因为高的地方留给天上的主，而低的地方留给世上的人。我还看到他们的矮屋，它们呈长方形，里面有一张床；这张床沿着墙围成一圈，当中没有间隙；他们躺在上面时，一个挨着一个。对面的入口处有一个半圆形的凹室，凹室前面有一张桌子，后面有一个壁炉。这壁炉照亮了整个房间。壁炉里没有燃烧的火，却有发光的木头，它发出的光和木火的火焰一样多。他们说，晚上，这些木头就像燃烧的煤火。</p>

<p>152. They went on to say that the inhabitants do not make their dwellings in lofty places, though, but instead in lowly huts on the ground, because lofty places are for the Lord who is in heaven and lowly places are appropriate for people in the physical world. They showed me their huts. They were rectangular. Inside, there was a long bed along the wall where they lay head to toe. Opposite the door was a circular area with a table at the front and a fireplace at the back that lit up the whole room. <sup>1</sup>No flames burned on the hearth, though; instead there was some luminous wood that gave as much light as the fire on any hearth. They said that in the evening these logs look as though they have burning embers within them.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;Swedenborg drew a floor plan of one of these houses in <a href="../se/1679.htm">Spiritual Experiences 1679</a>. For a reproduction, see figure 3. Although the sketch is very rough, it indicates the rounded end of the building, the hearth there, and a dotted line that apparently corresponds to the long bed against the wall. [SS] </p>

<p>152. They went on to say that the inhabitants of that world do not live high up, but at ground level in low huts. This is because heights are for the Lord who is in heaven, low dwellings for people on earth. I was also shown their huts. They were rectangular, having inside a bed running without a break round the walls, in which they sleep one next to another. On the side opposite the entrance there is a round recess with a table in front, and a hearth behind. This provides light for the whole room. They do not have a fire burning on the hearth, but some glowing wood which emits as much light as the flame of a fire. They said that towards eveningtime these logs look as if they had embers of fire in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 152</h4><p>152. They said, further, that the inhabitants do not live in high places, but on the earth in low cottages, for the reason that high places are for the Lord, who is in heaven, and low places for men, who are on earth. Their cottages were also shown to me. They were oblong, having within along the walls a continuous couch, on which they lie one after another. On the side opposite the door is a semicircular recess, before which is a table, and behind this a fireplace, by which the whole room is lighted. In the fireplace there is not a burning fire, but luminous wood which gives out as much light as the flame of a wood fire. They said that those pieces of wood appear in the evening like a fire of burning coals. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 152 (original Latin)</h4><p>152. Dicebant porro, quod incolae non habitent in altis, sed super terra in humilibus casis, ex causa quoniam alta sunt pro Domino qui in Coelo, et humilia pro hominibus qui in terra: etiam casae eorum mihi ostensae sunt; erant oblongae, intus juxta parietes Lectus continuus, in quo cubant unus post alterum; in parte opposita ostio est locus sinuatus in rotundum, ante quem mensa, ac post illam focus, ex quo illuminatur tota illa camera: in foco illo non est ignis ardens, sed est lignum luminosum, quod ex se tantum luminis effundit, quantum flamma focalis; ajebant quod ligna illa ad vesperas appareant sicut in illis esset ignis prunosus. </p>
