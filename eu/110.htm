<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>110、然而，他们当中那些能得救的人住在消磨的地方，这些人在那里陷入彻底的绝望。因为没有别的办法能制服并除去这类邪恶与虚假。当陷入绝望状态时，他们喊着说：我们是野兽，是可憎的，令人恨恶，因而受到诅咒。当处于这种状态时，他们当中一些人甚至对着天堂叫嚷。不过，他们是值得原谅的，因为这是从绝望发出来的。主抑制他们的咒骂，因此，他们只能在一定限度内发泄出来。经历极端的痛苦后，这些人最终得救，因为他们的肉体部分差不多死去了。我还被告知，这些人活在世上时就信某个至高的造物主，无需任何中保；但得救后，被指教唯独主是神，救主和中保。我曾看见他们当中一些人在经历了极端的痛苦后被提入天堂；当他们在天堂被接纳时，我从他们身上感受到一种如此温柔的喜悦，以致我的眼泪夺眶而出。</p>

<p>110. If they are capable of being saved, though, these spirits are taken to places set aside for the process of devastation <sup>1</sup>and there they are reduced to utter despair. This is because there is no other way that evil and falsity of this kind can be brought under control and put aside. When they are in a state of despair, they cry out that they are beasts, that they are loathsome, hateful, and therefore damned. Some of them even cry out against heaven when they are in this state, but this is overlooked in them because it is only an expression of their despair. The Lord makes sure, though, that their railing does not transgress certain limits.
<p>When they have suffered the furthest extreme of the process, their self-centered, carnal appetites die, so to speak, and they are finally saved.
<p>I was told concerning them that when they lived on their planet they believed in a Supreme Creator but without a mediator. <sup>2</sup>As they are being saved, though, they are taught that the Lord is the only God, Savior, and Mediator.
<p>I saw some of them, after they had suffered the worst, being carried up into heaven, and when they were accepted there I felt from them such a tender happiness that it brought tears to my eyes.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;The Latin here translated “devastation” is vastationis, traditionally translated “vastation.” On this concept, see note 2 in <a href="../lj/35.htm">Last Judgment 35</a>, and compare also note 1 in <a href="../njhd/158.htm">New Jerusalem 158</a>. [Editors]
<p>2.&nbsp;The parallel passage in Spiritual Experiences (= Swedenborg 1998-2013) 1449 states more clearly that the lack of belief in a “mediator” refers to a lack of belief in the Lord. Compare <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-timothy_2_5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_8_1.htm">Hebrews 8:1-7</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_9_11.htm">9:11-15</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hebrews_12_24.htm">12:24</a>, which gave rise to the Christian tradition of “Christ as mediator.” On the meaning of “mediator” and “mediation” in Swedenborg’s works, which, especially when used with reference to events before the Incarnation, also involves God becoming present through heaven and through angels and spirits, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4211.htm">Secrets of Heaven 4211:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/4724.htm">4724</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6804.htm">6804:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/6996.htm">6996</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8705.htm">8705</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/8864.htm">8864:2</a>; <a href="../ss/99.htm">Sacred Scripture 99</a>; <a href="../dlw/150.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 150</a>; <a href="../ar/484.htm">Revelation Unveiled 484:3</a>; <a href="../tcr/135.htm">True Christianity 135</a>. The concept of a mediating element between any extremes is very important in Swedenborg’s thinking as early as his scientific works. In secular Western thought it goes back in part to Aristotle’s insistence that in logic “a deduction cannot be drawn without a middle term” (Prior Analytics 66a27-28 [= Aristotle 1984, 105]); from there the secular theme merged with the notion that divine order requires continuity and connection between all parts of a universal hierarchy-a very old model of the world sometimes referred to as the Great Chain of Being. For Swedenborg’s discussion of the necessity of contiguity and connection in natural philosophy, see Basic Principles of Nature part 1, chapter 1 (= Swedenborg [1734] 1988, 1:20-25); on the mediating element, or nexus, with specific reference to Christ as the nexus, see The Infinite chapter 1, 9 (= Swedenborg [1734] 1965, 99-103). On the Great Chain of Being, see the classic study Lovejoy 1960b. [LSW, SS] </p>

<p>110. However, those of them who are such as can be saved are in places of vastation, where they are reduced to the uttermost despair. There is no other way that evils and falsities of that sort can be subdued and taken away. When they are in a state of desperation, they cry out that they are beasts, abominations, hateful, and therefore damned. When in that state, some of them even cry out against heaven; but they are forgiven for this because it is due to their despair. The Lord restrains them from going beyond fixed limits in calling down curses. After extremes of suffering, because their bodily parts are virtually dead, these are eventually saved. I was also told that, when these people lived in their world, they believed in some supreme Creator without any Mediator; but when saved, they are taught that the Lord is alone God, Saviour and Mediator. I saw some of them after extremes of suffering taken up into heaven; and when they were received there, I felt such a happy tenderness as to wring tears from my eyes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Earths in the Universe (Whitehead translation 1892) 110</h4><p>110. Such, however, amongst them, as can be saved, are in places of vastation, and are there reduced to the last state of desperation; for there is no other method whereby evils and false persuasions of that kind can be subdued and removed. When they are in a state of desperation, they cry out that they are beasts, that they are abominations; that they are hatreds, and that thus they are damned. Some of them, when they are in this state, exclaim even against heaven; but as this proceeds from desperation, it is forgiven them. The Lord moderates that in their vituperations, they may not pour them forth except to certain limits. These, when they have passed through extreme suffering, are finally saved, inasmuch as corporeal things with them are as if dead. It was further declared concerning these spirits, that during their life on their earth they believed in a certain Supreme Creator without a Mediator; but when they are saved, they are also instructed that the Lord alone is God, the Savior and Mediator. I have seen some of them, after they have passed through extreme suffering, taken up into heaven; and when they were received there, I have perceived such a tenderness of joy from them as drew tears from my eyes. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 110 (original Latin)</h4><p>110. Qui autem tales sunt, ut salvari possint, sunt in locis vastationis, ac ibi ad ultimum desperationis rediguntur; nam illius generis mala et falsa non aliter possunt domari et removeri: cum in statu desperationis sunt, clamant quod bestiae sint, quod abominationes, quod odia, et sic quod damnati: quidam eorum, cum in tali statu sunt, etiam contra coelum clamant; sed hoc illis ignoscitur, quia ex desperatione; Dominus moderatur, ne in vituperia se effundant nisi ad statos limites. Hi cum extrema passi sunt, quia corporea tunc apud illos quasi mortua sunt, demum salvantur. De his quoque dictum est, quod, cum in sua Tellure vixerunt, crediderint in quendam summum Creatorem absque Mediatore, sed cum salvantur, etiam instruuntur, quod Dominus sit solus Deus, Salvator et Mediator. Vidi quosdam ex illis, postquam extrema passi sunt, sublatos in coelum, et cum ibi recepti sunt, appercepi teneritudinem laetitiae ab illis talem, ut exprimeret lachrymas ex oculis meis. </p>
