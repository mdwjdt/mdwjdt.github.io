<h4 align="center">（本 2020）</h4><p>81、后来，我与天使谈论了我们地球上一些值得一提的事，尤其谈到印刷术、圣言和教会取自圣言的各种教义。我告诉他们说，圣言和教义都已出版，并被传播。他们感到非常惊讶的是，这类事物居然能通过书籍和印刷来出版。</p>

<p>81. Afterward I talked with these angels about things that are noteworthy on our planet, especially about our printing, about the Word, and about the various theological publications of the church based on the Word, saying that people here learn the Word and theological teachings because they are available in published form. The angels were utterly amazed that matters of this sort could be published in writing and in printed form. </p>

<p>81. Later I talked with the angels about experiences in our world, especially about printing here, the Word and various of the church's teachings drawn from the Word. I told them that the Word and religious teachings are published and so disseminated. They were very surprised that such matters could be published by books and printing. </p>

I afterward spoke with these angels about some notable things on our earth, especially about the art of printing, about the Word, and about the various doctrines of the church from the Word; and I said that the Word and the doctrines are published, and so are learned. They wondered exceedingly that such things could be published by writing and by types. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari 81 (original Latin)</h4><p>81. Postea loquebar cum angelis de memorabilibus in nostra Tellure, praecipue de Typis hic, de Verbo, de Doctrinalibus Ecclesiae ex Verbo variis, et dicebam, quod Verbum et Doctrinalia exstent vulgata et sic discantur; mirabantur valde, quod talia vulgari possent per scripta et per typos. </p>
