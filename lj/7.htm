<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第7节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>7.有许多证据可以证明，人类的繁衍将永远持续下去；其中一些证据在《天堂与地狱》一书已经说明，尤其是这些：
<p>⑴人类是天堂得以建立的基础。
<p>⑵人类是天堂的苗床。
<p>⑶为天使而存在的天堂，其整个范围如此之大，以致它永远无法填满。
<p>⑷目前，组成天堂的人相对较少。
<p>⑸天堂的完美随着它的居民数量增加而增加。
<p>⑹一切神性工作都关注无限和永恒。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Last Judgment (New Century Edition 2020) 7 </h4>
<p>7. Many points provide support for the idea that the reproduction of humankind is going to continue forever. Some of these have been presented in my book about heaven. <sup>1</sup>The following points are the most relevant: <sup>2</sup>
<p>1.	Humankind is the foundation on which heaven rests.
<p>2.	Humankind is the seedbed of heaven.
<p>3.	The full extent of heaven, which exists for the sake of angels, is so vast that it cannot be filled to eternity.
<p>4.	So far, heaven is made up of relatively few people.
<p>5.	Heaven's perfection increases as the number of its inhabitants increases.
<p>6.	And every divine work aims at what is infinite and eternal.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;The reference here is to Heaven and Hell, relevant passages of which are cited more specifically in the discussion that follows. [Editors]<br><br>2.&nbsp;On the geometrical style of argumentation, in which pithy statements are first presented without support in list form, and then taken up one by one and discussed, illustrated, and corroborated, see note 2 in <a href="../njhd/20.htm">New Jerusalem 20</a>. [JSR] </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1992) 7 </h4>
<p>7. There are very many proofs that the reproduction of the human race will continue for ever; some of these were demonstrated in my book HEAVEN AND HELL, especially these:
<p>1. The human race is the foundation upon which heaven is built.
<p>2. The human race is the seed-bed of heaven.
<p>3. The extent of the heaven for the angels is so immense that it cannot be filled to all eternity.
<p>4. The numbers in heaven so far are comparatively small.
<p>5. The perfection of heaven increases as its numbers grow.
<p>6. Every work of God reflects infinity and eternity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1892) 7 </h4>
<p>7. That the procreations of the human race will endure to eternity, is plain from many considerations, of which some are shown in the work on Heaven, especially from the following: 
<p>I. The human race is the basis on which heaven is founded. 
<p>II. The human race is the seminary of heaven. 
<p>III. The extension of heaven, which is for angels, is so immense that it cannot be filled to eternity. 
<p>IV. They are but few respectively, of whom heaven at present is formed. 
<p>V. The perfection of heaven increases according to its numbers. 
<p>VI. And every Divine work has respect to infinity and eternity. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Ultimo Judicio 7 (original Latin 1758)</h4>
<p>7. Quod procreationes generis humani in aeternum permansurae sint, constare potest ex pluribus, quorum aliqua in opere De Caelo ostensa sunt, imprimis ex his:- 
<p>(i.) Quod Genus Humanum sit basis, super quo fundatur Caelum. 
<p>(ii.) Quod Genus Humanum sit Seminarium Caeli. 
<p>(iii.) Quod Extensio Caeli, quod pro Angelis, tam immensa sit, ut in aeternum non impleri possit. 
<p>(iv.) Quod pauci sint respective, ex quibus adhuc Caelum. 
<p>(v.) Quod perfectio Caeli crescat secundum Pluralitatem. 
<p>(vi.) Et quod omne opus Divinum spectet infinitum et Aeternum. </p>
