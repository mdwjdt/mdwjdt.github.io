<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第49节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>49.在圣言中，四个方位被称为“四风”，聚集被称为“从四风招聚而来”，如马太福音中论述最后审判的地方所说的：
<p>祂要差遣祂的使者，用号筒的大声，将祂的选民从四风，从天这边到天那边，都招聚了来。（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">马太福音24:31</a>）
<p>别处：
<p>万族都要聚集在人子面前；祂要把他们彼此分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊、山羊一般。把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_32.htm">马太福音25:32-33</a>）
<p>这表示那时主要将那些处于真理，同时处于良善的人与那些处于真理，但未处于良善的人分开；因为就圣言的灵义而言，“右”表示良善，“左”表示真理，“绵羊”和“山羊”所表相同。审判只临到这些人身上；未处于真理的恶人早就在地狱中了；因为所有从心里否认神性的存在，弃绝对教会真理的一切信仰之人死后，因而在审判之前就被扔进地狱。过去的“先前的天”由那些处于真理，但未处于良善的人构成，“新天”由那些处于真理，同时处于良善的人形成。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Last Judgment (New Century Edition 2020) 49 </h4>
<p>49. In the Word the four quarters [of the spiritual world] are referred to as “the four winds,” and the gathering of people from them is referred to as “a gathering from the four winds,” as in Matthew where it speaks of the Last Judgment:
<p>He will send out his angels, and they will gather his chosen people from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>)
<p>Elsewhere in Matthew we read,
<p>All nations will be gathered before the Son of Humanity, and he will separate one from another the way a shepherd separates sheep from goats; and he will set the sheep on his right and the goats on the left. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a>)
<p>This means that the Lord is going to separate the people who are both seeking truth and doing good from the ones who are seeking truth but not doing good, since in the spiritual meaning of the Word “the right” and “sheep” mean goodness, and “the left” and “goats” mean truth. The judgment was not carried out on any others, since the evil who had no interest in truth were long since in hell. All the evil who at heart deny the existence of the Divine and reject all belief in the church's truths are cast into hell after they die. Therefore [such people were already in hell] before the judgment occurred.
<p>The first heaven that passed away was made up of people who were seeking truth but were not interested in doing good; and the new heaven was formed from the ones who were devoted to seeking truth and to doing good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1992) 49 </h4>
<p>49. The four quarters are called in the Word the four winds, and their being gathered is a gathering from the four winds; as in Matthew, dealing with the Last Judgment:
<p>He will send his angels, and they will gather the chosen from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.
<p>And elsewhere:
<p>There will be gathered before the Son of Man all nations, and he will separate one group from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and he will place the sheep to the right and the goats to the left. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a>.
<p>This means that the Lord will separate those who possess truths and also good from those who possess truths without good; for in the spiritual sense of the Word, right means good and left means truth, and much the same is meant by sheep and goats. Nor was judgment carried out on any others; for the wicked who possessed no truths were long since in the hells. That is where all the wicked are cast after death, without waiting for a judgment, who in their hearts deny the Divine and reject any belief in the church's truths. The former heaven which passed away was composed of those who possessed truths without good; and the new heaven was formed from those who possess truths and at the same time good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1892) 49 </h4>
<p>49. In the Word, the four quarters are called "the four winds," and a gathering is called "a gathering from the four winds;" as where the Last Judgment is the subject treated of in Matthew: 
<p>He shall send His angels, and they shall gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_31.htm">24:31</a>); and elsewhere: 
<p>All nations shall be gathered together before the Son of man, and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and He shall set the sheep on the right and the goats on the left (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31, 32</a>). This signifies that the Lord will then separate those who are in truths and at the same time in good, from those who are in truths and not in good; for in the spiritual sense of the Word, "the right" signifies good, and "the left" truth, and "sheep" and "goats" the same. The judgment was effected upon these alone; the evil who were in no truths being in the hells already; for all the evil in heart who have denied the Divine, and have rejected the truths of the church from their belief are cast thither after death, and therefore before the judgment. "The first heaven" which passed away, consisted of those who were in truths, and not in good, and "the new heaven" was formed of those who were in truths, and at the same time in good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Ultimo Judicio 49 (original Latin 1758)</h4>
<p>49. Quatuor plagae in Verbo vocantur "quatuor venti," et congregatio eorum "congregatio a quatuor ventis;" ut apud Matthaeum, ubi agitur de ultimo judicio, 
<p>"Mittet angelos suos,... et congregabunt electos,... a quatuor ventis, a caelorum extremo ad eorum extremum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_49/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_31" target=_top>Matthaeum 24:31</a>); 
<p>Et alibi, 
<p>"Congregabuntur" ante Filium hominis "omnes gentes, et separabit illos unum ab altero, sicut separat pastor oves ab hircis; et statuet oves ad dextrum, et hircos ad sinistrum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_49/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_32-33" target=_top>Matthaeum 25:32-33</a> <sup>1</sup>), 
<p>Significat quod Dominus separaturus sit illos qui in veris sunt et simul in bono, ab illis qui in veris sunt et non in bono, nam in Verbi sensu spirituali per "dextrum" significatur bonum, et per "sinistrum" verum; similiter per "oves" et per "hircos:" super alios nec factum est judicium; nam mali qui in nullis veris, jam pridem in infernis erant, illuc enim conjiciuntur omnes mali post mortem, ita ante judicium, qui corde negant Divinum et a fide rejiciunt ecclesiae vera. Ex illis qui in veris et non in bono fuerunt, exstitit "prius caelum" quod transivit; et ab illis qui in veris sunt et simul in bono formatum est "novum caelum."
