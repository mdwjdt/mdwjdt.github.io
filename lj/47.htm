<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第47节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>47.这本薄书无法详细描述此次最后的审判是如何发生的，不过《揭秘启示录》一书将予以详述。本次审判的对象不仅包括基督教会的所有人，还包括称为伊斯兰教徒的所有人和全世界所有的外邦人或异教徒。审判的顺序如下：首先是天主教徒，然后是伊斯兰教徒，再后是异教徒，最后是新教徒。对天主教徒的审判将在论述被毁的巴比伦那一章予以说明；对新教徒的审判已在论述过去的先前的天那一章说明（<a href="65.htm">65-72节</a>）；本章将说一说对伊斯兰教徒和异教徒的审判</p>

<h4 align="center">The Last Judgment (New Century Edition 2020) 47 </h4>
<p>47. In this booklet I cannot give the full details about how that Last Judgment was carried out-there are too many-but they will be set out in the explanation of the Book of Revelation. <sup>1</sup>In fact, that judgment was carried out not only on all the people from the Christian church but also on all the people called Muslims and also on all those of the other religions <sup>2</sup>on our planet; and it was done in the following sequence: first it was carried out on the people of the Catholic religion, then on the Muslims, then on the people of other religions, and finally on the Protestants. <sup>3</sup>
<p>For the judgment on the people of the Catholic religion, see the following chapter on the destruction of Babylon [<a href="53.htm">53-64</a>]. For the judgment on Protestants, see the chapter on the first heaven that passed away [<a href="65.htm">65-72</a>]. For the judgment on Muslims and the people of other religions, see this chapter [<a href="50.htm">50-51</a>].
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;On the work of exegesis referred to here, Revelation Explained, see note 1 in <a href="42.htm">Last Judgment 42</a>. On the promise of a more detailed description of the Last Judgment on Catholics and Protestants, see the notes in <a href="60.htm">Last Judgment 60</a> and <a href="72.htm">Last Judgment 72</a>, respectively. [Editors]
<p>2.&nbsp;The Latin word here translated “those of the other religions” is gentes, on which see note 2 in <a href="../njhd/3.htm">New Jerusalem 3</a> above. [Editors]
<p>3.&nbsp;The Latin word here translated “Protestants” is Reformatos, literally, “the Reformed.” The usage of the term “Reformed” in <a href="48.htm">Last Judgment 48</a> suggests that Swedenborg intends it here to refer to the churches that arose during the Reformation, that is, to Protestants in general, including those of the Lutheran tradition, rather than in the more specific sense of the churches inspired by the theology of John Calvin (see note 1 in <a href="../njhd/8.htm">New Jerusalem 8</a>). This usage is occasionally found in other authors as well. [RS, SS] </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1992) 47 </h4>
<p>47. The full story of how the Last Judgment took place is too long to tell in this short work, but it will be given in my Explanation of the book of Revelation. <sup>1</sup>The judgment was carried out not only on all from the Christian church, but also on all those known as Mohammedans, as well as all the heathen on this earth. It took place in the following order: first on those of the Roman Catholic religion, then on the Mohammedans, afterwards on the heathen, and lastly on the Reformed. The judgment on those of the Roman Catholic religion will be described in the next chapter on the destruction of Babylon; the judgment on the Reformed <sup>2</sup>in the chapter on the former heaven which passed away [<a href="65.htm">65-72</a>]. On the judgment on the Mohammedans and the heathen some remarks will be made in this chapter.
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong>
<p>1.&nbsp;[Although Swedenborg wrote a very detailed commentary on Revelation down to Chapter 19, he never completed it, but he published instead in 1766 a shortened version under the title THE APOCALYPSE REVEALED.]<br><br>2.&nbsp;[i.e. those belonging to the Reformed churches.] </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1892) 47 </h4>
<p>47. How this Last Judgment was effected cannot be described in all its details in this little work, for they are many, but shall be described in the Explanation of the Apocalypse. For the judgment was accomplished not only upon all the men of the Christian church, but also upon all who are called Mohammedans, and, moreover, upon all the Gentiles in the whole world. And it was effected in this order: first upon those of the Papal religion; then upon the Mohammedans; afterwards upon the Gentiles; and lastly upon the Reformed. The judgment upon those who were of the Papal religion shall be shown in the following article, on Babylon which has been destroyed; the judgment upon the Reformed in the article, on the first heaven which passed away; but something shall be said in this article, on the judgment upon the Mohammedans and Gentiles. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Ultimo Judicio 47 (original Latin 1758)</h4>
<p>47. Quomodo hoc ultimum judicium factum est, non potest in hoc opusculo in specie describi, quia plura sunt; sed describentur in Explicatione super Apocalypsin. Judicium enim non solum peractum est super omnes qui ab Ecclesia Christiana fuerunt, sed etiam super omnes qui vocantur Mahumedani, et quoque super omnes gentes in hoc terrarum orbe: et factum est hoc ordine; primum super illos qui a Pontificia religione fuerunt; dein super Mahumedanos, postea super Gentes, et ultimo super Reformatos. De judicio super illos qui a Pontificia religione fuerunt, videbitur in sequente articulo de Babylonia destructa; de judicio super Reformatos in articulo de priori caelo quod transivit; de judicio autem super Mahumedanos et super Gentes aliqua in hoc articulo dicentur. </p>
