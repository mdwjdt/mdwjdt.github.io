<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第29节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>29.最后的审判必发生在灵界，而非自然界或地上，这一点从前两章和接下来的几章可推知。前两章已说明：天堂和地狱皆来自人类（14-22节）；自创世之初以来，所有曾生而为人且已离世者，要么在天堂，要么在地狱，因此，他们全部集中在灵界（23-27节）。接下来的几章将说明：最后的审判已经完成（45-52，53-64节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Last Judgment (New Century Edition 2020) 29 </h4>
<p>29. On the point that the Last Judgment must take place in the spiritual world and not on earth or in the physical world, this follows from the two preceding chapters, as well as from chapters yet to come. The two preceding chapters explained that heaven and hell come from humankind [<a href="14.htm">14-22</a>] and that all humans without exception who have been born and have died since the beginning of creation are either in heaven or in hell, so they are all together in that world [<a href="23.htm">23-27</a>]. In chapters yet to come, we reach the point at which it is necessary to show that the Last Judgment has already taken place [<a href="45.htm">45-52</a>, <a href="53.htm">53-64</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1992) 29 </h4>
<p>29. The two preceding chapters have shown, and the following ones will show, that the Last Judgment will take place in the spiritual world, not in the natural world or upon earth. The earlier chapters showed that heaven and hell are from the human race, and that all who have been born as human beings from the beginning of creation and have died are either in heaven or in hell; so all are together there. In the following chapters it remains to be shown that the Last Judgment has already taken place. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1892) 29 </h4>
<p>29. That the Last Judgment must be in the spiritual world, and not in the natural world, or on the earth, is evident from the two preceding articles, and also from those that follow. In the two preceding articles it has been shown, that heaven and hell are from the human race; and that all who were ever born men since the beginning of creation, and are deceased, are either in heaven or in hell, thus that all are there together; but in the articles which follow it shall be shown that the Last Judgment has already been accomplished. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Ultimo Judicio 29 (original Latin 1758)</h4>
<p>29. Quod ultimum judicium exstiturum sit in mundo spirituali, et non in mundo naturali seu in terris, constat ex binis articulis qui praecedunt, et quoque ex illis qui sequuntur. In binis articulis qui praecedunt, ostensum est quod caelum et infernum sint ex humano genere; et quod omnes, quotcunque a principio creationis nati sunt homines, et defuncti, sint vel in caelo vel in inferno, ita quod omnes ibi simul sint: in articulis autem qui sequuntur, ostendendum venit, quod ultimum judicium jamdum peractum sit. </p>
