<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第21节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>21.主不仅在灵方面，还在身体方面复活，因为主在世时荣耀了祂的整个人身，也就是将它变成了神性。事实上，主从父那里所拥有的灵魂就是来自祂自己的神性本身，身体成为该灵魂，也就是父的一个样式，因而也是神性。这就是为何祂自己和任何人不同，在这两者方面都复活了。祂也将这一点显明给祂的门徒，因为门徒在看见祂时，以为看见了一个灵；于是主说：
<p>你们看我的手，我的脚，是我自己。摸我看看；灵是没有肉和骨的，你们看，我是有的。（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_36.htm">路加福音24:36-39</a>）
<p>祂以这些话来表明，祂不仅在灵方面，还在身体方面是人。</p>

<p>21. The reason the Lord rose from the dead not only spiritually but also physically is that when he was in the world he glorified his entire human nature, that is, made it divine. <sup>1</sup>His soul, which he had from the Father, was the Divinity in and of itself, and his body became a likeness of his soul-that is, of the Father-and therefore also divine. That is why he rose in respect to both soul and body, unlike anyone else. <sup>2</sup>He also proved this to his disciples. They thought they were seeing a spirit when they saw him, but he said:
<p>See my hands and feet-that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_37.htm">37</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_38.htm">38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_39.htm">39</a>)
<p>In this way he showed them that he was human not only with respect to his spirit but with respect to his body as well.

<p>21. The Lord rose again not only in spirit, but also in body, because the Lord, while in the world, glorified, that is, made Divine, His whole humanity. For the soul He had from the Father was of itself the real Divine, and His body became a likeness of the soul, that is, of the Father, so it too was Divine. That is why He, unlike any human being, rose again in both spirit and body. <sup>1</sup>He made this plain to the disciples, who thought they were seeing a spirit when they saw Him, saying:
<p>Look at my hands and my feet, see that it is I myself. Touch Me and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see Me have. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_36.htm">Luke 24:36-39</a>.
<p>In these words He indicated that He was man, not only in spirit but also in body.

<p>21. That the Lord rose again not only as to the Spirit, but also as to the Body, is because the Lord, when He was in the world, glorified His whole Human, that is, made it Divine. For the soul, which He had from the Father, was the Divine Itself from Himself, and the body was made a similitude of the soul, that is of the Father, and therefore also Divine. Hence it is that He Himself, unlike any man, rose again as to both; <sup>1</sup>which He also manifested to His disciples, who believed they saw a spirit when they saw Him; for he said: 
<p>Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself: feel Me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_36.htm">Luke 24:36-39</a>). 
<p>By which He pointed out that He was not only Man as to the Spirit, but also as to the body.

<p>21. Quod Dominus non modo quoad Spiritum, sed etiam quoad Corpus resurrexerit, est quia Dominus totum Humanum suum, cum fuit in mundo, glorificavit, hoc est, Divinum fecit: Anima enim, quae Ipsi a Patre, ex se ipsum Divinum fuit, et Corpus factum est similitudo Animae hoc est, Patris, ita quoque Divinum: inde est, quod Ipse secus ac ullus homo, quoad utrumque resurrexerit; <sup>1</sup>quod etiam manifestavit discipulis, qui credebant videre spiritum cum Ipsum, dicendo, 
<p>"Videte manus meas et pedes meos, quod Ipse Ego sim: palpate Me et videte; nam spiritus non carnem et ossa habet, sicut Me videtis habere" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_36-39" target=_top>Lucas 24:36-39</a> <sup>2</sup>);
