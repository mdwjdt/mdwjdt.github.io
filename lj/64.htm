<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第64节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>64.⑺从今以后，从尘世进入灵界的天主教徒情况如何。由于最后的审判如今已经完成，主通过这次审判使一切事物都回归秩序，凡内心良善者都被提入天堂，凡内心邪恶者都被投入地狱，所以从今以后，他们不允许像以前那样在天堂之下和地狱之上形成任何社群，也不可以与其他人有任何接触。相反，一进入灵界，如每个人死后所发生的情形，人们就完全分开，在灵人界度过一定时日后，就被带到自己的地方。因此，从今以后，那些亵渎圣物，就是声称自己拥有打开和关闭天堂，以及赦罪的权柄，即唯独属于主的权柄，将教皇法令等同于圣言，并以权力为目的的人，立即被投入黑海或大鸿沟，就是亵渎者的地狱所在的地方。但我从天上被告知，那些因这种宗教信仰而变得如此的人不关心死后的生命，因为他们从心里否认它，只想着世上的生命。因此，他们对自己死后的这种命运漠不关心，认为无足轻重，即便它会持续到永远；事实上，他们嘲笑它，好像这是一件完全无关紧要的事。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Last Judgment (New Century Edition 2020) 64 </h4>
<p>64. 7. What the circumstances are for Catholics from now on as they pass into the other world from this one. Since the Last Judgment has now been carried out and the Lord has brought everything back into order, and since all the people who were inwardly good have been taken up into heaven and all the ones who were inwardly evil have been cast down into hell, it is no longer allowed to be as it was, with people gathering together below heaven and above hell and being able to communicate with other groups there. Now, as soon as they arrive (which happens right after they die) the evil are kept completely separate, and after a given amount of time in the world of spirits are taken to their places. So the people who have profaned what is holy-the ones who claimed for themselves the power to open and close heaven and to forgive sins (a power that actually belongs to the Lord alone), the ones who made the pope's proclamations equal to the Word and had power over others as their primary goal-from now on these individuals are taken straight to the black ocean or into the chasms where the hells of the profaners are.
<p>I have been told by a heavenly source that the individuals of this religion who are like this pay no attention to life after death, because at heart they deny it. They believe only in life in this world. Therefore they care nothing for their plight after death, even though it will wear on to eternity; and in fact, they mock it as a thing utterly inconsequential. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1992) 64 </h4>
<p>64. On the state of those who come there from earth henceforward. Since the Last Judgment has now been completed and by this means all has been reduced to order by the Lord, those who were inwardly good being taken up into heaven and those who were inwardly wicked being cast down into hell, it is not allowed henceforth that there should be, as formerly, any communities below heaven and above hell, nor that they should have any contact with others. But as soon as people arrive there, as happens to every person after he dies, they are completely separated and after spending some time in the world of spirits they are taken to their appointed places. Those therefore who profane what is holy, those, that is, who claim for themselves the power of opening and closing heaven and of remitting sins, powers which belong to the Lord alone, and those who put papal bulls on the same level as the Word, with power as their aim in view, these people from now on are immediately taken to the black sea, or to the chasms where are the hells of those who commit profanation. But I was told from heaven that those whose religious belief makes them like this pay no attention to life after death, because at heart they deny there is any; they think only of life in the world. As a result they treat as a matter of no importance the kind of fate which awaits them when they die, laughing at it as if it were a trifle, although it is one which will last for ever. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1892) 64 </h4>
<p>64. The state of those hereafter who come thence from the earth. Since the Last Judgment has now been accomplished, and by means of it all things are reduced by the Lord into order, and since all who are interiorly good are taken into heaven, and all who are interiorly evil are cast into hell, it is not permitted them henceforth as heretofore, to form societies below heaven and above hell, nor to have anything in common with others, but as soon as they come thither, which is after the death of each, they are altogether separated, and after passing a certain time in the world of spirits, they are carried into their own places. They therefore who profane holy things, that is, who claim for themselves the power of opening and shutting heaven, and of remitting sins, which yet are powers belonging to the Lord alone, and who make Papal bulls equal to the Word, and have dominion for an end, are henceforth carried away immediately into that black sea, or into the gulfs, where the hells of profaners are. But it was said to me from heaven, that those of that religious persuasion who are such, do not look at all to the life after death, because they deny it in heart, but only to life in the world; and that hence they hold of no account this lot of theirs after death, which yet is to endure to eternity, but laugh at it, as a thing of nought. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Ultimo Judicio 64 (original Latin 1758)</h4>
<p>64. ((vii.)) De statu illorum posthac qui inde ex terris veniunt. Quoniam nunc ultimum judicium peractum est, et per id a Domino omnia in ordinem redacta sunt, ac omnes qui interius boni fuerunt in caelum sublati sunt, et qui interius mali in infernum dejecti, non sinitur posthac sicut hactenus, ut consocientur infra caelum et supra infernum, nec ut commune habeant cum aliis; sed ut primum illuc veniunt, quod fit post cujusvis obitum, prorsus separentur, et post transactum tempus in mundo spirituum, in loca sua ferantur; quare illi qui sancta profanant, qui sunt qui vindicant sibi potestatem aperiendi et claudendi caelum, ac remittendi peccata, quae tamen solius Domini sunt, et qui bullas papales Verbo pares faciunt, et pro fine habent dominium, posthac feruntur illico in mare nigrum, vel in voragines ubi inferna profanatorum sunt. Sed dictum mihi est e caelo, quod illi qui tales sunt ex illo religioso, nihil spectent ad vitam post mortem, quia eam corde negant, sed solum ad vitam in mundo, et quod inde talem eorum sortem post obitum, quae tamen in aeternum mansura est, floccipendant, et ad illam, sicut ad rem nihili, rideant. </p>
