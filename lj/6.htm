<h3 align="center" class="ired">《最后的审判》 第6节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">二、人类在地上的繁衍将永不止息</h4>
<p>6.那些相信到最后审判的时候，天地万物都要毁灭，一个新天和一个新地将取而代之的人，必由此从逻辑上得出这个结论：自此以后，人类的新生代和繁衍将要终止。因为他们认为，这标志着历史的结束，人们将处于不同于从前的状态。但由于最后审判之日并不意味着世界的毁灭，如前所示，故也可推知，人类将继续存在，繁衍将永不止息。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Last Judgment (New Century Edition 2020) 6 </h4>
<p>6. The Reproduction of Humankind on Earth Will Never Cease
<p>People who have adopted the belief that the Last Judgment will entail the destruction of everything in the heavens and on earth and that a new heaven and a new earth will come into being in their stead also believe, because it logically follows, that the reproduction and successive generations of humankind will come to an end after that. They think that all this will be over and humanity will then be in a different state than before. However, as explained in the preceding chapter [<a href="1.htm">1-5</a>], the day of the Last Judgment does not mean the destruction of the world; it follows, then, that humankind is in fact going to continue and its reproduction will not cease. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgement (Chadwick translation 1992) 6 </h4>
<p>6. II. THE REPRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RACE ON EARTH WILL NEVER CEASE.
<p>Those who have made it their belief that at the time of the Last Judgment everything both in the heavens and upon the earth will be destroyed, and their place will be taken by a new heaven and a new earth, are bound as a consequence to believe that new generations and the reproduction of the human race will cease after this. They think that this marks the completion of history and that people will change their state from what it was. But since the day of the Last Judgment does not mean the destruction of the world as was demonstrated in the last chapter, it also follows that the human race will continue in existence, and reproduction will not cease. </p>
<h4 align="center">Last Judgment (Whitehead translation 1892) 6 </h4>
<p>6. II. THE PROCREATIONS OF THE HUMAN ON THE EARTHS WILL NEVER CEASE. 
<p>They who have adopted as their belief concerning the Last Judgment, that all things in the heavens and on the earth are then to perish, and that a new heaven and a new earth will exist in their place, believe, because it follows of consequence, that the generations and procreations of the human race are therefore to cease. For they think that all things will be then accomplished, and that men will be in a different state from before. But since the day of the Last Judgment does not mean the destruction of the world, as was shown in the preceding article, it also follows that the human race will endure, and that procreations will not cease. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Ultimo Judicio 6 (original Latin 1758)</h4>
<p>6. (II.) QUOD PROCREATIONES GENERIS HUMANI IN TERRIS NUSQUAM CESSATURAE SINT. 
<p>Qui de ultimo judicio eam fidem ceperunt, quod tunc interitura sint omnia quae in caelis et in terris sunt, et quod loco eorum novum caelum et nova terra exstitura sint, credunt, quia id ex nexu rerum sequitur, quod generationes et procreationes generis humani postea cessaturae sint; cogitant enim quod omnia nunc peracta sint, et quod homines in alio statu futuri quam prius: sed quia interitus mundi non intellectus est per diem ultimi judicii, ut in praecedente articulo ostensum est, sequitur etiam quod genus humanum permansurum sit, et quod procreationes non cessaturae sint. </p>
