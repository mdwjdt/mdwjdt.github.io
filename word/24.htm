<h4 align="center">圣经的字义与灵义 24</h4><p>24. 圣经 <sup>1</sup><p>住在属灵国度更高处的天使拥有的圣经，其书写方式既能让睿智者以更为智慧的方式来理解，也能使简单者以简单的方式来理解。简言之，这本圣经既彰显出内在智慧，也彰显出外在智慧，其中有内在的表达。达到这个效果，有赖于字母上方各种标注点，这些标注点代表着各种情感。当这些标注点呈系列表达时，在更睿智者眼中就显示出更为内在的智慧。我曾经见过一些这样的圣经内容。<p>我还见过属天国度圣经的一些内容。该圣经中包含更多奥秘，乃是通过字母之上和之内的各种曲线和螺旋卷曲来表达，这是属天国度特有的标记。其中所含的奥秘无以伦比，属灵国度的天使无法理解，甚至无法想象。属灵天使因此得知，他们无法接近属天天使的智慧，正如属世领域的天使无法接近属灵国度天使的聪慧一样。属灵的聪慧完全超越属世的，我一次又一次的见证如此。<p>众多亲身见闻向我证实，属灵国度天使的聪慧对属世国度的天使而言，无以言表且无法理解；属天国度天使的智慧对属灵国度的天使而言，也是无以言表且无法理解。<p>至于主的神性智慧，超越了所有其它智慧，全然无可比拟。因为天使一切的聪明和智慧是有限的，而主的神性智慧是无限的。有限与无限之间，没有任何比例关系。天使的聪明和智慧是有限的，是因为天使是接受者，但凡接受者皆为受造之物，因而是有限的。<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;附注：第20-26节是后期所写，部分以笔记的形式。 </p>

<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Rogers translation 1997) 24</h4><p>24. The Word <sup>1</sup><p>Angels in the higher region of the spiritual kingdom have a Word so written that the intelligent can understand it in a continually more intelligent way, while the simple understand it in simplicity. It is a Word in which a more and more interior intelligence appears written. This circumstance is achieved by the use of various diacritical marks above the letters, the diacritical marks signifying affections. These diacritical marks in series express constantly more interior degrees of intelligence to the eyes of the more intelligent. I have seen something of this Word.<p>I have also seen something of the Word in the celestial kingdom. It has still more secrets indicated in it, but this by various curvatures and swirls above and within letters that are peculiar to the celestial kingdom. These secrets are of surpassing excellence. Nor can they be understood or even contemplated by an angel of the spiritual kingdom. Spiritual angels have therefore been told that they cannot approach the wisdom of angels of the celestial kingdom, even as those in a natural domain cannot approach the intelligence of angels of the spiritual kingdom. This intelligence completely transcends them, as I have discovered again and again.<p>I have had it proven to me from experience that the intelligence of angels of the spiritual kingdom is indescribable and incomprehensible to those in the natural kingdom, and that the wisdom of angels of the celestial kingdom is incomprehensible and indescribable to those in the spiritual kingdom.<p>But as regards the Lord's Divine wisdom, this so transcends all other wisdom that there is no relation. For all the intelligence and wisdom of angels is finite, while the Lord's Divine wisdom is infinite, and there is no proportional relation between the finite and the infinite. The intelligence and wisdom of angels is finite because angels are recipients, and all recipient things are created, thus finite.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The remaining numbers, 20-26, were written later, partly in the form of notes. See Translator's Remarks. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Chadwick translation 1997) 24</h4><p>24. XXIV. The Word.<p>In the spiritual kingdom they have the Word in its higher region, written in such a way that it can be understood ever more intelligently by an intelligent person, but simply by a simple person. In short, in this there is manifest an inner and an outer intelligence; and there is an inner script. <sup>1</sup>This is achieved by various sorts of pointing over the letters; the pointing means affections, and series of points express ever more inward types of intelligence for the more intelligent people. This Word was seen by me, at least some of it.<p>I also saw something in the Word <sup>2</sup>of the celestial kingdom. This has still more secrets noted, but by means of various curves and squiggles above and inside the letters, which are peculiar to the celestial kingdom. These secrets are especially transcendental, and cannot be grasped by an angel of the spiritual kingdom. In fact, he cannot think about them. They were accordingly told that they cannot come anywhere near the wisdom of the angels of the celestial kingdom, just as neither can those in the natural sphere come near the intelligence of the angels of the spiritual kingdom. It is utterly transcendental. I have frequently experienced this. Experience has established for me that the intelligence of the angels of the spiritual kingdom is indescribable and incomprehensible to those in the natural kingdom, and the wisdom of the angels of the celestial kingdom is incomprehensible and indescribable to those in the spiritual kingdom.<p>As regards the Lord's Divine wisdom, this is so far above all other wisdom that it has no standard of comparison. For all the intelligence and wisdom of the angels is finite, but the Lord's Divine intelligence and wisdom is infinite. The finite and the infinite have no standard of comparison. The reason why the intelligence and wisdom of the angels is finite is that angels are recipients, and all recipients are created, and also finite.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The text reads 'and the inner is written', but scripta is probably an error for scriptura. -Translator<br><br>2.&nbsp;The text should perhaps read 'in Verbo' for 'in eo Verbo', or if in is deleted 'ex Verbo'. -Translator </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Whitehead translation 1914) 24</h4><p>24. XXIV. THE WORD IN HEAVEN. <p>They have the Word in the spiritual kingdom in its higher region so written that it may be more and more intelligently understood by one who is intelligent, but simply by one who is simple, in which Word stands forth both interior and exterior intelligence, and the interior is written. This is effected by various points above the letters, the points signifying affections, and the series of points expressing the interior things of intelligence continuously to the more intelligent. This Word was seen by me, that is, something of it was seen. Something also of the Word of the celestial kingdom was seen, in which still more arcana were described, but by various curves and spirals above and within the letters, which are peculiar to the celestial kingdom. These arcana are very transcendent, nor can they be comprehended by an angel of the spiritual kingdom, nor even thought of; wherefore it was said to them that they can no more approximate to the wisdom of angels of the celestial kingdom than can those who are in a natural sphere approximate to the intelligence of angels of the spiritual kingdom; and how far this transcends has frequently been tried. From experience it was made evident to me, that the intelligence of angels of the spiritual kingdom is ineffable and incomprehensible to those who are in the natural kingdom; and that the wisdom of the angels of the celestial kingdom is incomprehensible and ineffable to those who are in the spiritual kingdom. But as to the Divine wisdom of the Lord, this so transcends all wisdom that no ratio can be given; for all the intelligence and wisdom of angels is finite, but the Divine wisdom of the Lord is infinite; and there is no ratio between the finite and the infinite. The intelligence and wisdom of angels is finite, because angels are recipients, and all recipients are created, and so finite. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo 24 (original Latin 1762)</h4><p>24. De Verbo<p>Habent Verbum in Regno spirituali, in superiore regione ejus, ita scriptum, ut possit ab intelligente intelligentius continue intelligi, at a simplici simpliciter, Verbum in quo exstat intelligentia interior et interior scripta; hoc fit per punctationes varias supra literas, nam punctationes significant affectiones; punctationum series exprimunt intelligentiae interiora jugiter coram intelligentiore; ex hoc Verbo mihi aliquid visum est. Visum etiam est aliquid ex Verbo Regni coelestis, in quo adhuc plura arcana designata sunt, sed per inflexuras et gyrationes varias supra et intra literas, quae propriae regni coelestis sunt; haec arcana valde transcendunt; nec ab angelo regni spiritualis comprehendi possunt, imo nec cogitari, quare illis dictum est quod non possint approximare ad sapientiam angelorum regni coelestis, sicut nec illi qui in naturali sphaera sunt, nec possunt approximare ad intelligentiam angelorum regni spiritualis; haec prorsus transcendit; hoc saepius expertum est. Ab experientia constiterat mihi, quod intelligentia angelorum regni spiritualis sit ineffabilis et incomprehensibilis illis qui in regno naturali sunt, et quod sapientia angelorum regni coelestis sit incomprehensibilis et ineffabilis illis qui in regno spirituali [sunt]. At quod ad Divinam Domini sapientiam attinet, haec ita transcendit omnem sapientiam, ut non detur ratio, nam omnis intelligentia et sapientia angelorum est finita, Divina autem [sapientia] Domini est infinita, et non datur ratio finiti et infiniti; angelorum intelligentia et sapientia est finita, quia angeli sunt recipientes, et recipientia omnia sunt creata, ita finita. </p>
