<h4 align="center">圣经的字义与灵义 1</h4><p>1. 圣经的字义与灵义<p>依据经历领悟主的话或圣经<p>圣经字义的象征内含灵义。<p>我曾获准见到几个大钱袋，里面装着大量的钱币。钱袋是敞开的，看起来谁都可以从中取钱，甚至全部拿走。不过有两个天使坐在钱袋边上看管。放钱袋之处看似马厩的食槽。隔壁的房间里有几位端庄的年轻女子，还有一位贞洁的妻子。有两个婴孩在那房间边上，我被告知，别把他们当作小孩一样玩耍，而要视他们为智者。然后，见到一个妓女，边上有一匹死马躺着。<p>于是，我察觉到这些事物用来代表圣经的字面意义（简称“字义”），内中包含属灵意义（简称“灵义”）。<p>装满金钱的大钱袋代表关于真理的知识有丰富的供应。钱袋被打开但是被天使看管代表任何人可从中提取所需，但要谨慎，以免歪曲内在的意义（简称“内义”），因为赤裸的真理暴露在内义中。<p>马厩中的食槽（就是钱袋所放之处）代表对领悟力的灵性指引。（“马槽”的这层意义也是主出生时被放在马槽中的原因，因为“马”象征理解或悟性，于是“马槽”象征对它的喂养。）<p>隔壁房间所见的端庄的年轻女子代表对教会真理的爱慕；贞洁的妻子代表圣经中处处可见的良善与真理的结合。婴孩代表圣经中智慧的天真无邪，他们是来自第三层天堂的天使，那里的人看起来都像婴孩。<p>与死马在一起的妓女代表现今众人对真理的歪曲，因此对真理的悟性尽失。（“妓女”象征歪曲，“死马”象征对真理的不理解。）<p>原文注释：圣经的字义是耶路撒冷城墙的根基，是其上的十二样宝石，还是亚伦以弗得上的乌明和土陵。 </p>

<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Rogers translation 1997) 1</h4><p>﻿THE SACRED SCRIPTURE OR WORD OF THE LORD, FROM EXPERIENCE<p>A Representation of the Literal Meaning of the Word, which has a Spiritual Meaning within<p>I was given to see large purses, looking like sacks, which had stored away in them a great deal of silver. Since they were open, it seemed as if anyone might help himself to the silver deposited in them, even to make off with it, but next to them two angels were sitting as guards. The place where the sacks rested looked like a manger in a stable. In the next room I saw modest maidens, together with a chaste wife. Near that room were two little children, and I heard it said they were not to be played with in a childish way, but wisely. Afterward a harlot appeared, then a horse lying dead.<p>I then perceived that this was a way of representing the literal meaning of the Word, which has a spiritual meaning within. The large purses full of silver symbolized concepts of truth there in great abundance. The sacks' being open and yet guarded by angels symbolized that anyone might acquire concepts of truth there, but that people should take care not to falsify the inner meaning, which contains only truths. The manger in the stable where the purses were sitting symbolized spiritual instruction for the intellect. (A manger has this symbolism, like the one where the newborn Lord lay, because a horse symbolizes the intellect, consequently a manger its nourishment.) The modest maidens I saw in the next room symbolized truths of the church, and the chaste wife the conjunction of truth and good that exists throughout the Word. The little children symbolized the innocence of the wisdom in it (they were angels from the third heaven, all of whom appear like little children). The harlot together with the dead horse symbolized the falsification of the Word by so many people today, by which all understanding of the truth has been lost. (A harlot symbolizes falsification, and a dead horse no understanding of truth.)<p>[Marginal Note]<p>what the foundation of the wall of Jerusalem is, and the twelve precious stones there, that they are the urim and thummim upon the ephod of Aaron </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Chadwick translation 1997) 1</h4><p>1. ON THE SACRED SCRIPTURE OR THE WORD OF THE LORD, from experience<p>I. A representation of the literal sense of the Word, containing a spiritual sense.<p>I was allowed to see great money-bags looking like sacks, in which a large sum of money was stored. Since the bags were open, it seemed as if anyone could help himself to the money in them, or even carry it all off; but near to them sat two angels as guards. The place where the sacks were stored looked like a manger in a stable. In the next room were to be seen some modest young women together with a chaste wife; and near that room were two children, and I was told they were to be played with not childishly, but wisely. Afterwards a prostitute was to be seen, and then a horse lying dead.<p>I then perceived that these represented the literal sense of the Word, in which there is a spiritual sense. <sup>1</sup>The large money-bags full of money meant knowledge about truth being present there in great quantity. Their being open, yet guarded by angels, meant that anyone could gain knowledge of truth from these, but care must be taken to avoid falsifying the internal sense, in which the bare truths are exposed. The manger in the stable, where the bags lay, meant spiritual instruction for the intellect. This meaning of a manger also applies to that in which the Lord lay when He was born; for a horse means the intellect, so a manger that which feeds it. The modest young women seen in the next room meant the truths of the church, and the chaste wife the linking of truth and good which is found throughout the Word. The children meant the innocence of the wisdom in it; they were angels from the third heaven, all of whom look like children. The prostitute with the lifeless horse meant the way many people today falsify the Word, as a result of which all understanding of the truth is lost. A prostitute means falsification, and a dead horse the absence of any understanding of truth.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Added in the margin: 'This is what the foundation of the wall of Jerusalem is, and the twelve precious stones in it, as well as the Urim and Thummim on Aaron's ephod.' -Translator. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Whitehead translation 1914) 1</h4><p>1. I. THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, IN WHICH IS THE SPIRITUAL SENSE, REPRESENTED. <p>It was given to see great purses, appearing like sacks, in which was hidden silver in great abundance; and, since these sacks were open, it seemed as if anyone might take from the silver placed therein, yea, steal from it; but near the sacks sat two angels who were guards. The place where the sacks were deposited appeared like a manger in a stable. In the next chamber were seen modest virgins together with a chaste wife, and near that chamber were two infants, and it was said that they were not to be played with in a childish manner, but wisely. Afterwards there appeared a harlot, and then a horse lying dead. It was then perceived that thus was represented the sense of the letter of the Word, in which is the spiritual sense. <sup>1</sup>Those great purses filled with silver signified the knowledges of truth in great abundance therein. That they were open and yet guarded by angels, signified that everyone may take thence the knowledges of truth, but that care must be taken lest its interior sense in which is nothing but verities be falsified. The manger in the stable where the sacks lay, signified spiritual instruction for the understanding. A manger signifies this, even the one wherein the Lord was laid when born; for a horse signifies the understanding: hence a manger signifies its nourishment. The modest virgins who were seen in the next chamber signified the truths of the church, and the chaste wife signified the conjunction of truth and good which is everywhere in the Word. The infants signified the innocence of wisdom in the Word; they were angels from the third heaven who all appear like infants. The harlot, with the dead horse, signified the falsification of the Word by many at this day, whereby all understanding of truth is destroyed; a harlot signifies falsification, and a dead horse, no understanding of truth. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;[MARGINAL NOTE.] The sense of the letter is the foundation of the wall of Jerusalem and the twelve precious stones there; these are the Urim and Thummin upon the ephod of Aaron. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo 1 (original Latin 1762)</h4><p>1. DE SCRIPTURA SACRA SEU VERBO DOMINI, AB EXPERIENTIA<p>Sensus literae Verbi, in quo sensus spiritualis, repraesentatus<p>Datum est videre magnas Crumenas, apparentes sicut sacci, in quibus reconditum fuit argentum multa copia, qui quia aperti erant, perceptum est sicut unusquisque posset argentum inibi positum exsumere, imo diripere, sed juxta illos sedebant bini Angeli, qui custodes. Locus ubi repositi sacci erant, apparebat instar praesepis in stabulo. In camera proxima visae sunt virgines modestae, cum uxore casta; et prope illam cameram erant bini infantes, et dictum est, quod cum illis non infantiliter sed sapienter ludendum sit. Postea apparebat scortum, tum equus jacens mortuus. Perceptum tunc est quod ita repraesentatus sit sensus literae Verbi in quo sensus spiritualis: magnae illae crumenae argento plenae significabant cognitiones veri in multa copia ibi: quod [sacci] aperti essent, et tamen ab angelis custoditi, significabat quod quisque inde posset cognitiones veri depromere, sed quod caveatur ne interiorem ejus sensum, in quo merae veritates sunt, falsificent; praesepe in stabulo, ubi jacebant crumenae, significabat instructionem spiritualem pro intellectu; hoc significat praesepe, etiam illud ubi Dominus natus jacebat, nam equus significat intellectum, inde praesepe nutritionem ejus: virgines modestae, quae in camera proxima visae sunt, significabant Vera Ecclesiae, et uxor casta conjunctionem veri et boni, quae in Verbo ubivis est; infantes significabant innocentiam sapientiae inibi; erant angeli e tertio coelo, qui omnes apparent sicut infantes; scortum cum equo exstincto, significabat falsificationem Verbi a plerisque hodie, per quam omnis intellectus veri deperditus est; scortum significat falsificationem, et equus mortuus intellectum veri nullum. </p>
