<h4 align="center">圣经的字义与灵义 26</h4><p>26. 圣经 <sup>1</sup><p>我曾考查过属灵天使讲话时如何组织话语，发现他们乃是照着事物所象征的意义来表达或说话，例如他们表达或说出“马”和“马车”时，他们乃是表达这些词所象征的意义—“马”象征领悟，“马车”象征来自圣经的教义；其它的表达与此类似。因此，他们乃是出于所见事物的对应来说话，甚至像世人那样。简言之，他们依据对应来命名事物。<p>[2] 如今已向这些天使揭示，他们语言中的用词含有对应。在此之前他们不晓得这些，不过当他们与我一起处于属世状态时，对比我当时对事物的观念，以及他们在属灵状态下对事物的观念，发现的确如此。总而言之，他们所讲语言的词汇皆由对应形成。<p>[3] 我请教他们如何书写“套在马车上的马”，他们写了个“I”，说这个字母表达如此。于是，我再请教他们是如何书写“对教义的悟解”，他们说同样写为“I”，不过那时他们的思维会提升得高一些。由此明显看出他们的语言中有对应存在，只是他们当中没什么人关注这一点。这就好比我们世上的人在谈到悟性之光，或者说到光照、启迪之类的话时，没几个人会注意到这是灵性之光；当说到天堂之火，还说让天堂之火点燃内心时，不会注意到这是灵性之火或灵性之热。也没人知道火与热对应爱—由心发出的爱，即对应于意志。不知道光对应于真理，即对应于智识。<p>本册子至此结束。<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;附注：第20-26节是后期所写，部分以笔记的形式。 </p><br><p align="center"><a href="25.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></p><hr />
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Rogers translation 1997) 26</h4><p>26. The Word <sup>1</sup><p>I have examined the way spiritual angels frame the words of their speech, and I discovered that they frame them and utter them according to and in consequence of ideas having to do with the things they symbolize. For example, when they say or pronounce "horse and carriage," they then use an expression that carries the symbolic meanings of these things, such as using a word for horse that comes from ideas having to do with the intellect, and a word for carriage that comes from ideas having to do with doctrine from the Word. And so on with the rest of their expressions. Thus they speak according to the correspondence about the things they see, even as people do. In short, they give names to things in accordance with their correspondence.</p><p>[2] It has consequently now been revealed to these angels that they use correspondences in the words of their speech. This they did not know before, but they discovered it when they were in a natural state with me, by examining in that state the ideas they had of things in a spiritual state. In a word, the expressions of their speech or language are all formed in accordance with correspondences.</p><p>[3] I asked the angels how they would write "horses harnessed to a carriage." They said they would write simply l, and that this letter would express it. I then asked how they would write "understanding of doctrine." They said they would do so likewise by writing l, only then they would have a higher thought of it. This, too, made it apparent that the expressions of their language involve correspondences. But few of them had paid any attention to this, just as few in this world give any thought to spiritual light when the light of the intellect is referred to, or when enlightenment and seeing the light are mentioned, or as few give any thought to spiritual fire and heat when heavenly fire is alluded to as the fire that burns in the heart, not knowing that fire and its heat correspond to love in the heart, that is, in the will, and that light corresponds to truth in the intellect.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The remaining numbers, 20-26, were written later, partly in the form of notes. See Translator's Remarks. </p><h4 align="center">De Verbo (Chadwick translation 1997) 26</h4><p>26. XXVI <sup>1</sup>. The Word.<p>Investigation was made into the manner in which the spiritual angels pronounce the words of their speech. I learned that they enunciate or pronounce them in accordance with ideas and these are the ideas conveyed by the things they mean. So when they enunciate or pronounce a horse and carriage, they express them by a word which has a [spiritual] meaning; for instance, a horse by a word based on an idea of the intellect, and a carriage by a word based on the idea of teaching from the Word, and likewise in other cases. Thus they use correspondence to speak of things which they see, as people on earth do. In short, they give things names based upon their correspondence.</p><p>[2] So now it has been disclosed to them that they have correspondences in the words of their speech. They did not know this previously, but it was disclosed by the fact that they investigated in my mind at the natural level their ideas about those in the spiritual state. In short, all the words of language they speak are formed from correspondences.</p><p>[3] I enquired how they write 'horses harnessed to a carriage'. They said they write only l, and this letter expresses that. Then I enquired how they write 'the understanding of teaching'. They said it was in the same way by l; but then they were thinking at a higher level. But few of them paid any attention to this, just as few in this world think of spiritual light, when mention is made of the light of the intellect, or of illumination and enlightenment; or of spiritual fire or heat when mention is made of heavenly fire, as for instance that which kindles hearts. They do not know that fire and the heat it gives corresponds to love, which is an emotion of the heart, that is, of the will, <sup>2</sup>and light corresponds to truth, which is an action of the intellect.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is no section headed XXV.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Reading voluntatis for voluntati. -Translator </p><h4 align="center">De Verbo (Whitehead translation 1914) 26</h4><p>26. XXVI. <sup>1</sup>[THE WORD WITH THE SPIRITUAL ANGELS.] <p>Exploration was made as to how the spiritual angels express the words of their speech, and it was found that they express or speak them according to ideas, and from the ideas of the things which they signify, as when they express or speak of a horse and chariot, then they express them by a word which is significative, as a horse from ideas of the understanding, and a chariot from ideas of doctrine from the Word; and in like manner in other cases; so that they speak from the correspondence of those things which they see in like manner as men. In a word, they give names to them from correspondence.</p><p>[2] It was therefore now disclosed to them, a thing they had not known, that they have correspondences in the words of their speech; and it was disclosed by their examining in the natural with me their ideas concerning those things in a spiritual state. In a word, the words of speech of their tongue were all formed from correspondences.</p><p>[3] Inquiry was made as to how they write, "horses harnessed to a chariot." They said that they write only l, and that that letter expresses it. Inquiry was then made how they write "the understanding of doctrine," and they said in like manner by l, but that they are then in a higher thought. From this also it was plain that there are correspondences in the words of their language, but that few of them had attended to this, just as few in this world attend to spiritual light, when the light of the understanding is spoken of, or illumination and enlightenment; and to fire or spiritual heat when heavenly fire is spoken of, as that which enkindles hearts, not knowing that fire and heat therefrom correspond to love, which is of the heart, that is, to the will, and light to truth, which is of the understanding. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No number 25 is found.<br>2.&nbsp;The manuscript ends here. </p><h4 align="center">De Verbo 26 (original Latin 1762)</h4><p>26. De Verbo<p>[1] Exploratum est quomodo angeli spirituales enuntiant suae loquelae voces, et compertum est quod enuntient et eloquantur illas secundum ideas et ex ideis rerum quas significant, sicut cum enuntiant aut eloquuntur Equum et currum, tunc enuntiant illos per vocem quae significat, sicut equum ex ideis intellectus, et currum ex ideis doctrinae ex Verbo, et similiter reliqua; sic ut loquantur ex correspondentia de illis quae vident similiter ac homines, verbo, nomina imponunt illis ex correspondentia.<p>[2] Detectum itaque nunc illis est, quod correspondentias in vocibus suae loquelae habeant; hoc nec prius sciverunt, sed detectum est per id, [quod] in naturali apud me exploraverint ideas suas de illis in statu spirituali; verbo, voces loquelae seu linguae eorum sunt omnes formatae ex correspondentiis.<p>[3] Inquisitum est quomodo scribunt equos alligatos currui; dixerunt quod scribant modo l, et quod illa litera exprimat illud; tum inquisitum est quomodo scribunt intellectum doctrinae; dixerunt quod similiter per l, sed quod tunc sint in cogitatione superiore; inde etiam patuit quod vocibus linguae eorum insint correspondentiae; sed pauci ex illis ad id attenderant, sicut pauci in hoc mundo [attendunt] ad lucem spiritualem, quando dicitur lux intellectus, tum illuminatio et illustratio, et ad ignem seu calorem spiritualem quando dicitur de coelesti igne, ut qui accendat corde, non scientes quod ignis et inde calor correspondeat amori qui est cordis, hoc est, voluntatis, et lux veritati quae est intellectus. </p><br><p align="center"><a href="25.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></div>
