<h4 align="center">圣经的字义与灵义 15</h4><p>15. 遗失的古圣经<p>我从第三层天的天使得知，古人有一本全然以对应写成的圣经，类似我们的圣经、然而已经遗失。他们说这样的古圣经仍保存在他们手中，为天堂一些古人所用—就是那些在世时使用古圣经的人们。<p>诸天堂之中仍使用古圣经的古人，部分来自迦南地及其邻近区域，还有些来自亚细亚地区某些国家，如叙利亚、美索不达米亚、阿拉伯、迦勒底、亚述、埃及、西顿和推罗等等。这些地方的居民举行的敬拜都具有象征性的形式，他们因而熟悉对应。对应学是那个时代智慧的基础，因为它能使人们与天堂保持联系，有内在的觉知，在很多情况下可与灵交谈。<p>然而，因为古圣经充满了对应之事，它们象征的天堂之事却十分遥远，于是随着时间的推移许多人开始篡改它。所以，顺应主的天命，古圣经逐渐消失，赐下另一圣经，所书写的对应事物就没有那么遥远。此圣经通过先知传给以色列的后代。然而，这本圣经仍然保持了迦南地以及亚细亚周边的地名，并保留着相同的象征意义。正因如此，亚伯拉罕后代的雅各一系被带入迦南地，在此写成赐予他们的圣经，并用到当地存在的那些地名。<p>[2] 古圣经在古人之中的存在还能从摩西五经看出，摩西提到古圣经并在《民数记》<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">21:14</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_17.htm">17</a>节中引用了古圣经的一些内容。古圣经的历史部分被称作“耶和华战记”，预言部分被称为“神谕”。以下是摩西从古圣经历史书部分引用的内容：<p>“所以耶和华的战记上说、苏法的哇哈伯与亚嫩河的谷、并向亚珥城众谷的下坡、是靠近摩押的境界”（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">民数记21:14</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_15.htm">15</a>）。《耶和华战记》描述了主征战地狱并得胜之事，后来主降世为人应验了此事。在我们这本圣经的历史书中，许多地方都象征和描述了这样的征战，例如《约书亚记》中与迦南地各族之间的战事，以及《士师记》《列王记》中的诸般争战，还有大卫王和其他诸王之间的争战。<p>[3] 以下是摩西从古圣经的预言部分引用的内容：“所以那些作诗歌的说、你们来到希实本、愿西宏的城被修造、被建立、因为有火从希实本发出、有火焰出于西宏的城、烧尽摩押的亚珥和亚嫩河邱坛的祭司、摩押啊、你有祸了、基抹的民哪、你们灭亡了、基抹的男子逃奔、女子被掳、交付亚摩利的王西宏、我们射了他们、希实本直到底本尽皆毁灭、我们使地变成荒场、直到挪法、这挪法直延到米底巴”（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">民数记21:27-30</a>）。<p>这些预言性的话语被称作“神谕”，而不是译者通常翻译的“格言”或“作格言者”，可从圣经希伯来原文moshalim <sup>1</sup>之意就可看出。关于它们不仅是格言，还是预言性宣告的进一步证据，可见于《民数记》（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">23:7</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>）。那里都说巴兰要发出他的宣告，也是预言—关于主的预言。他在那里的宣告被称为“神谕”，是单数形式。而且，在那些引文中，摩西所形容的都是预言，并非什么格言。<p>[4] 古圣经同样是神性的，或者说，是神所默示的，从《耶利米书》明显看出，那里有几乎相同的话语：“有火从希实本发出、有火焰出于西宏、烧尽摩押的角和哄嚷人的头顶、摩押啊、你有祸了、属基抹的民灭亡了、因你的众子都被掳去、你的众女也被掳去”（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">耶利米书48:45-46</a>）。<p>除了这些，古圣经中还有一卷被称为“雅煞珥书”，或者“正直人书”的预言书，被大卫（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_18.htm">撒母耳记下1:18</a>）和约书亚（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_13.htm">约书亚记10:13</a>）引用。由此清晰可见，《约书亚记》中关于日头和月亮的陈述乃是从《雅煞珥书》引用的一个预言。<p>我还进一步获知，《创世记》前七章完整地出现在古圣经中，一字不漏。<p>[5] 众多国家和民族的宗教信仰与习俗源自古圣经并由此传出。例如，从迦南地和亚细亚各地传至希腊，再由希腊传至意大利；经埃塞俄比亚和埃及传到非洲各国。然而希腊人则利用对应的知识创作出神话，并将上帝的属性赋予诸多神明，他们称为至高的那位朱庇特主神（Jove），就是源自耶和华（Jehovah）。 </p>

<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Rogers translation 1997) 15</h4><p>15. The Lost Ancient Word<p>Angels of the third heaven have told me that the ancients had a Word among them, written, like our Word, solely in terms of things that correspond, but which has since been lost. They also said that this Word is still preserved among them, and is used by the ancients in that heaven, for whom this was the Word when they lived in the world.<p>These ancients among whom this Word is still used in heaven came partly from the land of Canaan and its borders, also from certain kingdoms in Asia, such as Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Chaldea and Assyria, and from Egypt, Sidon and Tyre. The inhabitants of all those kingdoms possessed a representational worship and therefore had a knowledge of correspondences. They acquired the wisdom of that age from that knowledge, since by it they had communication with the heavens and an interior perception. And by it many of them were able to speak with spirits.<p>But because that Word was filled with correspondent things that only remotely signified heavenly things, and because as a consequence many in the course of time began to falsify it, therefore in the Lord's Divine providence it gradually disappeared, and another Word was given, written in terms of things whose correspondences were not so remote. This was the Word given through the prophets to the children of Israel. Nevertheless, this latter Word retained the names of places located in the land of Canaan and round about in Asia, and these maintained the same symbolic meanings. For this reason, the descendants of Abraham through the line of Jacob were brought into the land of Canaan, and there the Word given to them was written, where those places existed whose names were to be used.</p><p>[2] The existence of such a Word among the ancients is also apparent in the writings of Moses, who refers to it and quotes something from it in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27</a>. Narrative portions of this Word written as history were called The Wars of Jehovah, and the prophetic portions were called Oracles. Moses quoted the following from the narratives of that Word:<p>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: "Waheb in Suphah, and the streams, the Amon, and the channel of the streams which went down to the dwelling place of Ar and stops at the border of Moab." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>)<p>The Wars of Jehovah in that book mean and describe the Lord's combats with the hells and His victories over them, which would take place when He came into the world. These same combats are also meant and described in many places in the historical portions of our Word-such as by the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, and by the wars of the judges and kings, both the wars of David and those of the other kings.</p><p>[3] From the prophetic portion of the Ancient Word Moses quoted the following:<p>Therefore the prophetic Oracles say: "Go into Heshbon; the city of Sihon will be built and established. For a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, which consumed Ar of Moab, the possessors of the heights of the Amon. Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and given his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites. We finished them with arrows; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon. And we laid them waste as far as Nophah, which (reaches) even to Medeba." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>)<p>That these prophetic utterances were called Oracles, and not proverbs or "those who speak in proverbs" as translators render it, can be seen from the meaning of the word moshalim <sup>1</sup>in the original Hebrew, which means not only proverbs but also prophetic oracles - as can be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">Numbers 23:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>. In each of these verses Balaam is said to have put forth his oracle, which was a prophetic one (prophetic, in fact, of the Lord). His oracle each time is called mashal, in the singular. The words quoted by Moses in these verses are also prophecies, not proverbs.</p><p>[4] That the Ancient Word was similarly Divine or Divinely inspired as our Word is apparent from Jeremiah, where almost the same words occur as those quoted above, namely:<p>... a fire has gone out from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, which consumed the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished! For your sons have been taken off into captivity, and your daughters into captivity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>)<p>In addition to these references, a prophetic book also of that same Ancient Word, called the Book of Jashar or Book of the Upright, is cited by David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>) and Joshua (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>). it is apparent from this that the story in Joshua about the sun and the moon was a prophecy from that book.<p>I further have been told that the first seven chapters of Genesis appear in the same Ancient Word so completely that not the least word is missing.</p><p>[5] The religious beliefs and practices of many nations were derived and transmitted from that Word. For instance, they were transmitted from the land of Canaan and from various places in Asia to Greece, and from Greece to Italy, and through Ethiopia and Egypt into several countries in Africa. But in Greece the people used correspondences to create fables, and they turned the attributes of God into so many deities, the greatest of which they called Jove, after Jehovah.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Sic. The writer does not distinguish between moshelim (the utterers) and meshalim (the utterances), both here and elsewhere. Cf. The <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27</a> reads moshelim, but which could be repointed to read meshalim. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Chadwick translation 1997) 15</h4><p>15. XV. The lost ancient Word.<p>It was reported to me by angels of the third heaven that the ancients had a Word written entirely by means of correspondences like our Word, but that it has been lost. I was told that this Word is still preserved among them, and is used by the ancients in that heaven who had that Word when they were in the world. The ancients among whom that Word is still in use in the heavens were in part from the land of Canaan and the neighbouring region, and also from some kingdoms of Asia, for instance, from Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Chaldaea and Assyria, from Egypt, Sidon and Tyre. The inhabitants of all these kingdoms had a representative form of worship, and so knew about correspondences. This knowledge was the basis of the wisdom of that time, since it enabled them to communicate with the heavens, to have inner perception, and in many cases to speak with spirits. But because this Word was full of correspondences of a kind which only remotely meant heavenly things, so that as time passed it began to be falsified by many people, the Lord's Divine Providence ensured its gradual disappearance, and another Word was given, which was written by means of less distant correspondences. This was delivered to the Children of Israel by the Prophets. This Word, however, kept the names of places in the land of Canaan and the surrounding parts of Asia with similar meanings. It was for this reason that the descendants of Abraham from Jacob were brought into the land of Canaan, and the Word which names these places was written there.</p><p>[2] A further proof of the existence among the ancients of such a Word is found in the writings of Moses, who mentions it by name; and a passage was taken from it found in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27</a>. The historical parts of that Word were called 'The Wars of Jehovah' and the prophetic part 'The Utterances'. Moses took the following quotation from the historical parts of that Word:<p>Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah and the streams of Arnon, and the water-channel of streams which dropped down to where Ar lived and stopped at the boundary of Moab. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>.<p>By the Wars of Jehovah are to be understood and described the Lord's battles with the hells and His victories over them, when He should come into the world. The same battles are also to be understood and described in the historical parts of our Word, as in Joshua's wars with the peoples of the land of Canaan, in the wars of the Book of Judges, and in those of David and the other kings.</p><p>[3] The following passage was taken by Moses from the prophetical parts of that Word:<p>Therefore the Prophetic Utterances say, Enter into Heshbon, the city of Sihon will be built and strengthened. For fire has gone out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, which devoured Ar of Moab, the possessors of the heights of Arnon. Woe betide you, Moab; you are ruined, people of Chemosh. He made his sons fugitives and his daughters captives of the Sihon king of the Amorites. We killed them with arrows, Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon; and we laid them waste as far as Nophah, even as far as Medeba. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>.<p>These prophetic passages are called Utterances, and not Proverbs or the Composers of Proverbs, as the translators have it. This may be established from the meaning of the Hebrew word meshalim. A further proof that they are not just proverbs, but also prophetic utterances may be drawn from <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>, where it is said that Balaam gave forth his utterance, which was a prophecy, also concerning the Lord. His utterance is there called mashal in the singular. (The things in them described by Moses too are prophecies, not proverbs.) <sup>1</sup></p><p>[4] This Word was Divine or divinely inspired in the same way, as is evident in Jeremiah, where almost the same words are repeated, namely:<p>A fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from among Sihon, which devoured the corner of Moab, and the top of the sons of tumult. Woe betide you, Moab; the people of Chemosh has been ruined, for your sons are snatched away into captivity, and your daughters into captivity. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">45-46</a>.<p>In addition to these a prophetic book of that ancient Word called the Book of Jashar or the Book of the Upright Man is quoted by David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>) and by Joshua (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_13.htm">10:13</a>). This plainly shows that the story of the sun and the moon there was a prophecy from that book. Moreover I was told that the first seven chapters of Genesis are so clearly to be seen in that same Word, that there is not so much as a little word missing.</p><p>[5] The religious beliefs of many peoples were drawn and transcribed from that Word, passing for instance from the land of Canaan and various parts of Asia to Greece, and thence to Italy; and by way of Ethiopia and Egypt to some African kingdoms. But in Greece they made up myths by means of correspondences, and turned the attributes of God into as many deities; they called the greatest of them Jove after Jehovah. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;These words are added in the margin. -Translator<br><br>2.&nbsp;This is not strictly true; neither Latin Jupiter (genitive Jovis) nor the corresponding Greek name Zeus have anything to do with the Hebrew Yahweh or Jehovah. -Translator </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Whitehead translation 1914) 15</h4><p>15. XV. THE ANCIENT WORD THAT IS LOST. <p>That there was a Word with the ancients, written like our Word by mere correspondences, but that this has been lost, has been told me by angels of the third heaven. They said further that this Word is still preserved with them, and is in use among the ancients in that heaven, whose Word it was when they were in the world. Those ancients, with whom that Word is still in use in the heavens, were in part from the land of Canaan and its borders, and also from certain kingdoms in Asia, as from Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Chaldea, Assyria, and Egypt, from Sidon and Tyre, the inhabitants of all of which kingdoms were in representative worship, and thus in a knowledge of correspondences. Their wisdom at that time was from that knowledge, since by it they had communication with the heavens, and interior perception, and also many had converse with spirits. But because that Word was full of such correspondences, which remotely signified heavenly things, and for that reason in the course of time began to be falsified by many, therefore from the Divine providence of the Lord it gradually passed out of sight, and another Word was given, which was written by correspondences less remote, and this through the prophets with the sons of Israel. In this Word, however, the names of places in the land of Canaan and in Asia round about, were retained and kept their signification. For this reason, the posterity of Abraham from Jacob were introduced into the land of Canaan, and the Word in which those places were to be named was there written.</p><p>[2] That there was such a Word with the ancients is plain also in Moses, by whom it is mentioned and something is taken from it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-27</a>). The historicals of that Word were called the Wars of Jehovah, and the propheticals the Enunciations. From the historicals of that Word Moses took these words: <p>Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah, At Vaheb in Suphah, and the streams of Arnon, and the channel of the streams that descend towards the dwelling of Ar, and reach to the border of Moab (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14, 15</a>). <p>By "the Wars of Jehovah" are there meant and described the combats of the Lord with the hells and victories over them, when He should come into the world. The same combats are also meant and described in many places in the historicals of our Word, as in the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, in the wars of the judges, and in the wars of David and the rest of the kings.</p><p>[3] From the propheticals of that Word these words were taken by Moses: <p>Wherefore the prophetic enunciations say, Come ye to Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and established, for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath devoured Ar of Moab, the possessors of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab! Thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh. He hath given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, unto Sihon king of the Amorites. With darts we have destroyed them. Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which is even unto Medeba (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>). <p>That these propheticals were called Enunciations, and not Proverbs or the makers of proverbs, as the translators render it, may be evident from the signification of the word maschalim in the Hebrew language, which means not only proverbs, but also prophetic enunciations, as may appear elsewhere in Numbers (23:<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; 24:<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>), where it is said that Balaam put forth his enunciation, which also was a prophecy, yea, concerning the Lord. His enunciation is there called a maschal, in the singular. Furthermore, those things which are described by Moses in those citations are prophecies, but they are not proverbs.</p><p>[4] That that Word was in like manner Divine, or Divinely inspired, is plain in Jeremiah, where are almost the same words, as follows: <p>A fire has gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh hath perished; for thy sons are carried away into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45, 46</a>). <p>Besides these, a prophetic book of that ancient Word, called the Book of Jasher, or the Book of the Upright, is also cited by David (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>), and by Joshua (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>); from which it is plain that the historic statement there about the sun and moon, was a prophecy from that book. It has moreover been told me that the first seven chapters of Genesis are so manifestly extant in that same Word, that not a little word is wanting.</p><p>[5] The religious systems of many nations have been derived from that ancient Word and carried elsewhere, as from the land of Canaan and from various parts of Asia into Greece and from there into Italy, and through Ethiopia and Egypt into certain kingdoms of Africa. In Greece, however, out of correspondences they made fables, and out of the Divine attributes they made so many gods, the greatest of whom they called Jove, from Jehovah. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo 15 (original Latin 1762)</h4><p>15. De Verbo Vetusto deperdito<p>[1] Quod Verbum apud Antiquos fuerit, conscriptum per meras correspondentias, sicut nostrum Verbum, sed quod hoc deperditum sit, relatum mihi est ab angelis tertii Coeli, et dictum quod id Verbum adhuc apud illos conservatum sit, et in usu apud antiquos in illo Coelo, apud quos, cum in mundo fuerunt, id Verbum fuit; antiqui illi apud quos illud Verbum adhuc in usu est in coelis, fuerunt quoad partem ex terra Canaane, et ex confiniis ejus, tum etiam ex aliquibus regnis in Asia, ut ex Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Chaldaea et Assyria, ex Aegypto, ex Zidone et Tyro, quorum omnium regnorum incolae in cultu repraesentativo fuerunt, et inde in scientia correspondentiarum; sapientia illius temporis fuit illis ex illa scientia, quoniam per illam fuit illis communicatio cum coelis, ac perceptio interior, et apud plures colloquutio cum spiritibus: sed quia id Verbum erat plenum talibus correspondentiis, quae remote significabant coelestia, et inde successu temporis a multis incepit falsificari, ideo ex Divina Domini Providentia successive evanuit, et aliud Verbum, quod per correspondentias non ita remotas conscriptum est, datum est, et hoc per Prophetas apud filios Israelis. In hoc Verbo tamen retenta sunt nomina locorum, quae in terra Canaane, et circum circa in Asia sunt, ac significabant similia. Propter hanc causam, posteri Abrahami ex Jacobo introducti sunt in terram Canaanem, et ibi scriptum est Verbum in quo loca illa nominanda erant.<p>[2] Quod tale Verbum apud antiquos fuerit, patet etiam apud Mosen, a quo nominatur, et aliquid exinde desumtum, in Numeri Cap. XXI, Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_14" target=_top>14</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_27" target=_top>27</a>. Historica illius Verbi vocabantur Bella Jehovae, et Prophetica Enuntiata: ex Historicis istius Verbi desumsit Moses haec, Propterea dicitur in Libro Bellorum Jehovae: vahebam in Supha, et fluvios, Arnonem, et aquae ductum fluviorum, qui declinavit, usque ubi habitatur Ar, et sistit se ad terminum Moabi, Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>; per Bella Jehovae intelliguntur et describuntur ibi Pugnae Domini cum infernis, ac victoriae super illis, quando in mundum venturus esset; eaedem etiam pugnae multis in locis intelliguntur et describuntur in Historicis nostri Verbi, ut in bellis Josuae cum gentibus terrae Canaanis, et in bellis Judicum et regum, et iis Davidis et reliquorum Regum.	<p>[3] Ex Propheticis istius Verbi, haec desumta sunt a Mose, Propterea dicunt Enuntiata prophetica: ingredimini Chesbonem, aedificabitur et confirmabitur urbs Sichonis: nam ignis exivit ex Chesbone, flamma ex urbe Sichonis, quae comedit Ar Moabi, possessores excelsorum Arnonis: vae tibi Moabe, periisti popule Kemoschi; dedit filios suos evasores, et filias suas in captivitatem regi Emorraei Sichoni. Cum telis confecimus eos, periit Chesbon usque ad Dibonem, et devastavimus eos usque ad Nophach, quod usque ad Medebam, Vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_27" target=_top>27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_28" target=_top>28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_29" target=_top>29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_30" target=_top>30</a>; quod Prophetica illa dicta sint enuntiata, et non proverbia seu proverbiorum compositores, ut translatores vertunt, constare potest a significatione vocis Moshalim in Lingua Hebraea, quod non modo sint Proverbia, sed etiam enuntiata prophetica, ut constare potest ex Num. Cap. XXIII, vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_23_18" target=_top>18</a>, Cap. XXIV, vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_24_3" target=_top>3</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_24_15" target=_top>15</a>, ubi dicitur quod Bileamus ediderit Enuntiatum suum, quod fuit propheticum, etiam de Domino; enuntiatum ejus ibi vocatur Mashal, in singulari; illa quae a Mose in illis desumta sunt etiam sunt prophetica, non autem proverbia.<p>[4] Quod illud Verbum similiter Divinum seu Divinitus inspiratum fuerit, patet apud Jeremiam, ubi paene similia Verba sunt, nempe, Ignis exivit ex Chesbone, et flamma ab inter Sichonem, quae comedit angulum Moabi, et verticem filiorum strepitus. Vae tibi Moabe, periit populus Kemoschi, nam rapti sunt filii tui in captivitatem, et filiae tuae in Captivitatem, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_48_45-46" target=_top>Jerem. 48:45-46</a>. Praeter haec citatur etiam Liber propheticus Verbi istius Vetusti vocatus Liber Jashar seu Liber recti, a Davide, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_1_18" target=_top>II Sam. 1:18</a>, et a Josua, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_15/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_10_13" target=_top>Cap. 10:13</a>; ex quo patet, quod Historicum ibi de Sole et Luna, fuerit propheticum ex illo Libro. Dictum insuper mihi est, quod septem prima Capita Geneseos in eodem Verbo tam plene exstent, ut non verbulum desit.<p>[5] Religiosa plurium gentium ex illo Verbo derivata et translata sunt, ut a terra Canaane exque Asiae variis locis in Graeciam, et inde in Italiam, et per Aethiopiam et per Aegyptum in aliqua Regna Africae: sed in Graecia ex correspondentiis fecerunt fabulas, et ex attributis Divinis totidem Deos, et maximum illorum vocabant Jovem, a Jehovah. </p>
