<h4 align="center">圣经的字义与灵义 17</h4><p>17. 因为圣经的存在，教会之外以及无圣经的人也能得到光照。<p>有一个真相：除非人间某处有教会，教会有圣经，且借着圣经，主被人所知晓，否则人间与天堂就失去连接；因为主是天堂和人间的上帝，离了主就没有拯救。哪怕只有一间拥有圣经的教会在世上某处存在，即使它由比较少的人构成，就已足够。通过这间教会，主的临在仍遍布全世界，藉此天堂与人类连接。因为连接通过圣经发生，所以若非世上某处有圣经，没有人会获得连接。<p>主的临在以及天堂与世上各处之人的连接，都是经由圣经达成的，因为在主眼中全部天堂如同一个人，教会也是如此。而且，它们的确是一个人，因为主就是天堂，主也是教会。宣读圣经并认识主的教会如同此人里面的心和肺，身体所有其他器官和肢体因心肺这两个生命之源而得维持存活和生命。无论世上哪种宗教，只要敬奉独一上帝，就构成这个巨人—即天堂和教会—的器官和肢体，从而维持存活和生命。经由圣经在教会中的存在—即使那里人数较少—其他人也可以得到经由天堂而来的主的生命，就像身体其他部位的器官和肢体从心肺汲取生命一样。他们之间的交流与此相似。<p>这也就是为甚麽读圣经的基督徒，构成这个巨人身体胸部的原因。因为他们位居中央。围绕他们的是天主教徒，再向外是伊斯兰教徒—他们尊主为最伟大的先知和上帝的儿子，再往外是非洲人，最外层由亚洲和印度群岛各民族及众百姓构成。在此巨人身体之中的每个人都面向中央。此外，如前所述，拥有圣经的基督徒位于中央，享有最丰炽的光照，因为天堂之光是从显为太阳的主发出的神性真理。于是这光从中央向周边散发，赐下启示。这就是为何教会之外的各民族和众百姓也因圣经而受光照启迪。因为人领悟的一切真理之光皆经由天堂发自主.<p>[2] 天堂作为整体如此，而天堂的每个社群也是如此，因为天堂每个社群都是一个缩小版的天堂，在主眼中也显为一个人（相关主题，可参照《天堂与地狱》<a href="../hh/41.htm">41-87</a>节）。在每个社群，位处中央的天使也类似于心肺，他们享有最丰盛的光照。这光—连同这光导致的真理领悟—从中央发出，向各个方向辐射，直至边缘，赐予他们属灵生命。此外我还被示知，当居于中央并享有最盛光照者（就是形成心肺的众天使）离开时，居于周边的其它天使就会进入相对的阴暗中，对真理的领悟力减弱，及至几乎荡然无存。但当这些天使归回原位后，光照又恢复如初，他们对真理的领悟也复原。<p>[3] 由此可见，归正教会持有的圣经将通过灵性沟通的方式光照众民族和诸百姓。主还定意使世上始终存有一个读圣经的教会。这也是为何当罗马天主教几乎抛弃圣经时，出于主的天命，宗教改革就会发生，圣经重新被接受，且被天主教国家中某个高贵民族 <sup>1</sup>尊为神圣。<p>[4] 没有圣经，就没有对主的认识，也就没有拯救。所以，当犹太人持有的圣经被充分掺假和扭曲，以致几近无效时，主乐意降临世间，不仅应验圣经，而且使之更新并恢复，再次光照这世上之人。正如主在马太福音所说：<p>“太初有道 <sup>2</sup>，道与上帝同在，道就是上帝。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里。那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人”（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">5</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>）<p>“我是世界的光，跟从我的，就不在黑暗里走，必要得着生命的光”。（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_12.htm">约翰福音8:12</a>）；<p>“那坐在黑暗里的百姓看见了大光，坐在死荫之地的人有光发现照着他们”。（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_16.htm">马太福音4:16</a>）<p>[5] 预言说，在当代教会的末期，暗昧再度兴起，是由于不接受和不承认主为天地之上帝，还由于将信与仁爱分离，于是泯灭了对圣经的正解。出于这个原因，主如今乐意揭示圣经的灵义，昭示世人，就灵义而言，圣经所论的乃是主和教会，确实唯独论及主和教会。还揭示了许多其他事情，以此来恢复那几近熄灭的真理之光。<p>主在《马太福音》中说的以下话语，就意味着真理之光在当代教会的末期几近熄灭：那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星从天上坠落，天势都要震动。。。那时他们要看到人子有能力、有大荣耀、驾着天上的云降临（<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_29.htm">马太福音24:29-30</a>）。<p>此处的“日头”象征主的神性之爱。“月亮”象征对主之信；“众星”象征对于主的良善和真理的认知。“云”象征圣经的字义，“荣耀”象征圣经的灵义。“人子”象征主的圣经。<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;附注：几乎可以肯定是指法兰西民族，请参阅《圣治》（<a href="../dp/257.htm">257:4</a>）及其它地方。<p>2.&nbsp;Word，直译为“话语”，也就是上帝的话语，圣言，或圣经。 </p>

<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Rogers translation 1997) 17</h4><p>17. But the fact of the matter is this: There cannot be any conjunction with heaven unless somewhere on earth a church exists which has the Word and where by it the Lord is known, because the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and apart from the Lord there is no salvation. It is sufficient that a church possessing the Word exist somewhere on earth, even if it consists of relatively few people. By means of it the Lord is still present throughout the whole world, and by it heaven is joined to the human race. For conjunction takes place by means of the Word, whereas without the Word somewhere in the world, there would be no conjunction with anyone.<p>The Lord's presence and the conjunction of heaven with people on earth is everywhere effected by means of the Word because in the Lord's sight all of heaven is like a single person, and so, too, is the church. Moreover, each also actually is a person, since the Lord is heaven, and the Lord is the church. In this person, the church where the Word is read and where the Lord is therefore known is like the heart and the lungs; and just as in the human body all the rest of the organs and parts draw their subsistence and life from these two wellsprings of life, so likewise do all they in the world who have any sort of religion in which one God is worshiped, and who form the organs and parts of that grand person which is heaven and the church. For these others have life from the Lord through heaven by means of the Word in the church, even if it exists with comparatively few, just as the organs and parts of the rest of the body draw their life from the heart and the lungs. There is also a similar communication.<p>This, too, is why Christians among whom the Word is read form the breast of that grand person. They are also at the center of all. Around them are Roman Catholics. Around these are Muslims, who acknowledge the Lord as the greatest prophet and as the son of God. After these, then, come Africans. And the outmost periphery is composed of nations and peoples from Asia and the Indies. All those who are in that person also face toward the middle. Moreover, the greatest light, too, is found in the middle, where, as said, are Christians who possess the Word, because the light in heaven is Divine truth emanating from the Lord as its sun. From there as from its center, the light radiates out to all the peripheral areas and gives them light. This is the source of the enlightenment of nations and peoples not in the church-which also comes by means of the Word. For all light of truth in a person comes from the Lord through heaven.</p><p>[2] What is true of heaven as a whole is also true of every society in heaven, for every society of heaven is a heaven in smaller form, and it likewise appears in the Lord's sight as a single person (on which subject, see the book <a href="../hh/41.htm">Heaven and Hell 41-87</a>). In each society, too, those who are at the center similarly resemble the heart and the lungs, and they possess the greatest light. This light, with a resulting perception of truth, radiates out from that center in all directions toward those on the peripheries and gives them their spiritual life. I have been shown, moreover, that when those who were in the middle, who formed the region of the heart and lungs and who therefore possessed the greatest light, were removed, those who lived round about were left in comparative darkness, and that they then had such a weak perception of truth as to have scarcely any. But as soon as the others returned, their light reappeared as before, and they recovered their former perception of truth.</p><p>[3] It can be seen from this that the Word as it exists in the church with Protestants gives light to all nations and peoples by a spiritual communication such as has been described. Also that the Lord provides that there always be on this earth a church where the Word is read. That is why, when the Word was almost cast aside by Roman Catholics, of the Lord's Divine providence the Reformation took place in which the Word was again received. At the same time it was also provided that the Word be held holy by a noble nation <sup>1</sup>among the Catholic countries.</p><p>[4] Since without the Word there is no concept of the Lord, consequently no salvation, therefore when the Word in possession of the Jewish nation was completely adulterated and falsified and thus virtually nullified, it pleased the Lord to come into the world and not only fulfill the Word, but also renew and restore it and so give light once again to the inhabitants of this earth-according to the Lord's words in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light appears in darkness.... He was the true light, which enlightens every man coming into the world. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_4.htm">4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>)<p>Again in John:<p>(Jesus said,) "I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_12.htm">John 8:12</a>)<p>And in Matthew:<p>The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. Upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has arisen. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>)</p><p>[5] It was foretold that at the end of the present church, darkness would again arise in consequence of its failure to recognize and acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth, and in consequence of its separating faith from charity, by which a proper understanding of the Word perished. Because of this, it has therefore now pleased the Lord to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Word, and to make known that the Word in its spiritual meaning speaks of the Lord and the church, indeed of the Lord and the church only, and to disclose many other things by which to restore the light of truth that was almost extinguished.<p>The extinction of the light of truth at the end of the present church is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew:<p>Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then ... they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with ... glory and power. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29-30</a>)<p>By the sun there is meant the Lord in respect to His Divine love, by the moon the Lord in relation to faith, by the stars the Lord in relation to concepts of good and truth, by the clouds the literal meaning of the Word, and by glory its spiritual meaning-the Son of Man referring to the Lord in relation to the Word.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Almost certainly a reference to the French nation.

<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Chadwick translation 1997) 17</h4><p>17. XVII. But the truth is that there can be no linking with heaven, unless somewhere on earth there is a church which possesses the Word, and the Lord is known through its means, because the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and without Him there can be no salvation. It is enough for a church possessing the Word to exist somewhere on earth, even though it has relatively few members. The Lord is still by this means present throughout the whole globe, and by this means heaven is linked with the human race. But without the Word somewhere on earth, no one could be so linked.<p>The reason for the Lord's presence and the linking of heaven with the inhabitants of every part of the earth is that in the Lord's sight the whole of heaven is like one man, and so is the church; and it really is a man, because the Lord is heaven and also the church. The church, where the Word is read and the Lord is known by it, is like the heart and lungs in that man; and it is these two founts of life in the human body which allow all the other limbs and organs to remain in existence and live. So too do all the inhabitants of the globe, whose religion is the worship of one God, and who make up the limbs and organs of that Grand Man, which is heaven and the church, remain in existence and live. For it is by means of the Word in the church, even though among comparatively few, that the rest have life from the Lord through heaven, just as the limbs and organs throughout the body do from the heart and lungs. The communication between them is similar.<p>This too is the reason why the Christians, among whom the Word is read, make up the chest of that man; for they are in the very middle. Around them are the Roman Catholics, around them the Mohammedans, who acknowledge the Lord as a very great Prophet and a Son of God; and beyond them come the Africans. The outermost ring is made up of the races and peoples from Asia and the Indies. All those who are in that man face towards the centre. Moreover, that centre, occupied as I have said by the Christians who have the Word, enjoys the strongest light, because light in the heavens is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as the sun. Thus light radiates as from its centre to all the circumference, and gives enlightenment. This is how the races and peoples too outside the church are enlightened by means of the Word. For all the light of heaven a person experiences comes from the Lord through heaven.</p><p>[2] What is true of heaven as a whole is also true of each community in heaven, for each of the communities there is a small-scale heaven; and it also appears in the Lord's sight like one man. (On this see my Heaven and Hell [<a href="../hh/41.htm">41-87</a>].) There too those in the middle answer in the same way to the heart and lungs, and they enjoy the strongest light. The light itself, and the perception of truth it confers, radiates from the middle in all directions towards the circumference, and is the cause of their spiritual life. It was demonstrated that so long as <sup>1</sup>those are removed who were in the middle, making up the province of the heart and lungs and enjoying the strongest light, those in the surroundings were in shade, and at that time had such a poor perception of truth that there was hardly any. But as soon as they returned, the light became as it was before, and so did their perception of truth.</p><p>[3] These facts may establish that the Word possessed by the Reformed church enlightens all races and peoples by a spiritual communication of this kind. Also, that the Lord sees to it that on this earth there is always a church where the Word is read. When therefore the Word was more or less rejected by the Roman Catholics, by the Lord's Divine Providence the Reformation took place; and there the Word was again accepted, and it was also regarded as holy by a noble nation among the Papists.</p><p>[4] Since without the Word there is no recognition of the Lord, and so no salvation, when the Word among the Jewish race was utterly adulterated and falsified, so making it as naught, the Lord was pleased to come into the world; and not only to fulfil the Word, but also to renew and restore it, thus giving light again to the inhabitants of this earth. As the Lord says in John:<p>In the beginning there was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light shines out in the darkness. This was the true light, which enlightens everyone who comes into the world. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>.<p>In the same book:<p>Jesus said, I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_12.htm">John 8:12</a>.<p>And in Matthew:<p>A people sitting in darkness has seen a great light. For those who sit in the neighbourhood and shadow of death, for them the light has risen. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>.</p><p>[5] It was predicted that at the end of this church too darkness would arise as a result of the failure to recognise and acknowledge the Lord as being the God of heaven and earth, and as a result of separating faith from charity, so causing the true understanding of the Word to be lost. The Lord therefore has been pleased at this time to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, and to make it known that the Word in that sense deals with the Lord and the church, in fact with nothing but them; and to reveal many other things which may restore the light which had almost been extinguished. It is the extinction of the light of truth at the end of this church which is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew:<p>Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; and then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of the sky with glory and power. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29-30</a>.<p>The sun there is to be understood as the Lord as regards Divine Love, the moon as the Lord as regards faith, the stars as the Lord as regards knowledge of good and truth, clouds as the literal sense of the Word and glory as its spiritual sense, the Son of Man as the Lord as regards the Word.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The correct reading is probably quamdiu. -Translator </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo (Whitehead translation 1914) 17</h4><p>17. XVII. [BY MEANS OF THE WORD THOSE ALSO HAVE LIGHT WHO ARE OUT OF THE CHURCH AND HAVE NOT THE WORD.] <p>The case is thus: there cannot be any conjunction with heaven, unless somewhere on the earth there is a church where the Word is, and by it the Lord is known; for the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and without the Lord there is no salvation. It is enough that there be somewhere on the earth a church where the Word is. Though it consist of comparatively few, still by means of it, the Lord is present everywhere in the whole world, and by means of it heaven is conjoined to the human race, for conjunction is effected by means of the Word. But without the Word somewhere in the world there would not be conjunction with anyone. The reason of the presence of the Lord and of the conjunction of heaven with the inhabitants of the earth everywhere by means of the Word, is, that the whole heaven is before the Lord as one man, and likewise the church, and it is also actually a man, because the Lord is heaven and also the church. <p>In that man the church where the Word is read and thereby, the Lord is known, is like the heart and lungs; and as from those two fountains of life in the human body all the rest of the members and viscera subsist and live, so also all those in the world who have a religion in which one God is worshipped, and who constitute the members and viscera of that Greatest Man which is heaven and the church, subsist and live. For, by means of the Word in the church, though it be among comparatively few, life is given to the rest from the Lord through heaven, as from the heart and lungs to the members and viscera of the whole body. <p>The communication is also similar. This is the reason that Christians with whom the Word is read, constitute the breast of that man and are also in the midst of all; round about them are the Roman Catholics, around these are the Mohammedans who acknowledge the Lord as the Greatest Prophet and as the Son of God, behind them are the Africans, and the Gentiles and people of Asia and the Indies constitute the outmost circumference. All who are in that man look also towards the middle region. Moreover in that middle region where, as already said, are the Christians who have the Word, is the greatest light, because light in the heavens is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as the sun. The light thence, as from its center, propagates itself to all the borders, and enlightens. Hence the Gentiles and peoples outside of the church are enlightened also by means of the Word, for all the light of truth with man is from the Lord through heaven.</p><p>[2] As it is in the whole heaven, so also is it in every society of heaven, for each society of heaven is a heaven in smaller form, and also is in the sight of the Lord as one man, in regard to which see the work on <a href="../hh/41.htm">Heaven and Hell 41-87</a>. There also they who are in the midst in like manner relate to the heart and lungs, and with them is the greatest light. The light itself and the perception of truth thereby propagates itself from that middle portion towards the borders in every direction, and makes their spiritual life. It was also shown me that when those who were in the midst, who constituted the province of the heart and lungs, and with whom therefore was the greatest light, were taken away, those who were round about were in shade, and in so little perception of truth that it was scarcely any at all. But as soon as they returned, the light was seen as before, and there was perception of truth as before.</p><p>[3] From this it may be seen that the Word which is in the church of the Reformed, enlightens all nations and peoples by spiritual communication, which is of this nature; also that it is provided by the Lord that in this earth there may always be a church where the Word is read. When therefore the Word was almost rejected by the Roman Catholics, by the Divine providence of the Lord the Reformation was effected, and in that the Word was again received, and it was also regarded as holy by a noble nation among the Papists.</p><p>[4] Since without the Word there is no knowledge of the Lord, thus no salvation, therefore when the Word was altogether adulterated and falsified with the Jewish nation, and hence as it were made of none effect, it pleased the Lord to come into the world and not only to fulfill the Word, but also to renew and restore it, and so again to give light to the inhabitants of this earth, according to the words of the Lord in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light appeareth in the darkness. He was the true light, which lighteth every man coming into the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>). <p>In the same: <p>Jesus said, I am the light of the world: he that followeth Me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_12.htm">John 8:12</a>). <p>And in Matthew: <p>The people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, to them did light spring up (Matthew <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_16.htm">4:16</a>).</p><p>[5] Since it has been foretold that in the end of this church darkness would also arise, from a lack of knowledge and acknowledgment of the Lord, that He is the God of heaven and earth; and from the separation of faith from charity, whereby the genuine understanding of the Word has perished; therefore it has pleased the Lord now to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, and to show that the Word treats in that sense of the Lord and of the church, yea, of them only, and to show many other things by which the light of truth, almost extinguished, may be restored. That the light of truth at the end of this church would be extinguished, is meant by the words of the Lord in Matthew: <p>Immediately after the affliction of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: and then they shall see the Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven, with glory and power (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29, 30</a>). <p>By the "sun" is here meant the Lord as to the Divine love, by the "moon" the Lord as to faith, by the "stars" the Lord as to knowledges of good and truth, by "clouds" the sense of the letter of the Word, and by "glory" its spiritual sense, and by the "Son of man" the Lord as to the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Verbo 17 (original Latin 1762)</h4><p>17. [1] Sed res ita se habet; non dari potest aliqua conjunctio cum Coelo, nisi alicubi in Tellure sit Ecclesia ubi est Verbum, et per id Dominus notus, quia Dominus est Deus coeli et terrae, et absque Domino [est] nulla Salus; satis est quod alicubi in Tellure sit Ecclesia ubi [est] Verbum, tametsi consistit ex paucis respective; per id usque Dominus praesens est ubivis in universo terrarum orbe, et per id Coelum conjunctum est Humano Generi, nam conjunctio est per Verbum; at absque Verbo alicubi in terrarum orbe, non foret conjunctio cum aliquo. Causa praesentiae Domini et conjunctionis coeli cum terricolis ubivis per Verbum, est quia universum Coelum coram Domino est sicut unus Homo, similiter Ecclesia, et quoque actualiter est Homo, quia Dominus est Coelum, et quoque Ecclesia: in illo Homine est Ecclesia ubi Verbum legitur, et Dominus est inde notus, sicut Cor et sicut Pulmo, et sicut ex his binis fontibus vitae in humano corpore omnia reliqua membra et viscera subsistunt et vivunt, ita quoque omnes illi in terrarum orbe, apud quos religiosum est, in quo Deus unus colitur, et qui constituunt membra et viscera Maximi illius Hominis, qui est Coelum et Ecclesia, subsistunt et vivunt: per Verbum enim in Ecclesia, tametsi apud paucos respective, est vita reliquis a Domino per coelum, sicut membra et viscera totius corporis [vivunt] ex corde et pulmone; est quoque communicatio similis. Quae etiam causa est, quod Christiani, apud quos legitur Verbum, constituunt Pectus illius Hominis; sunt etiam in medio omnium; circum illos sunt Catholico-Romani, circum illos sunt Mahumedani, qui agnoscunt Dominum ut Maximum Prophetam, ac ut Filium Dei; post hos autem sunt Africani, ac ultimam circumferentiam constituunt gentes et populi ex Asia et ex Indiis: spectant etiam omnes qui in Homine illo sunt, versus Meditullium. Praeterea etiam in meditullio illo, ubi, ut dictum est, sunt Christiani quibus est Verbum, est maxima Lux, quia Lux in Coelis est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, ut Sole; Lux inde, ut a suo centro, propagat se ad omnes peripherias, ac illustrat. Inde est illustratio gentium et populorum extra Ecclesiam, etiam per Verbum nam omnis lux veri est ex Domino per coelum apud hominem.<p>[2] Sicut est in universo coelo, ita quoque est in unaquavis societate coeli, nam unaquaevis societas coeli, est Coelum in minore forma, et quoque in conspectu Domini est sicut unus homo, de qua re videatur in Opere de Coelo et Inferno n....; ibi etiam, qui in medio sunt, similiter referunt cor et pulmonem, et apud illos est maxima lux; ipsa lux, et inde perceptio veri, a medio illo se propagat versus peripherias quaquaversum, et facit vitam illorum spiritualem; ac ostensum est, quod quando illi qui in medio erant, qui provinciam cordis et pulmonis constituebant, et apud quos ideo maxima lux esset, auferrentur, quod illi qui circum circa erant, in umbra essent, et tunc in tam pusilla perceptione veri, ut vix in aliqua; sed mox ut redierunt, visa est lux sicut prius, et fuit perceptio veri sicut prius.<p>[3] Ex his constare potest, quod Verbum, quod est in Ecclesia Reformatorum, illustret omnes gentes et populos per communicationem spiritualem, quae talis est; tum quod provideatur a Domino, ut in Tellure hac semper sit Ecclesia ubi Verbum legitur. Quare cum Verbum a Catholico-Romanis paene rejectum est, ex Divina Domini Providentia facta est Reformatio, et ibi Verbum iterum receptum; et quoque [provisum est] quod sanctum habeatur [Verbum] a nobili gente inter Pontificios.<p>[4] Quoniam absque Verbo [est] non cognitio Domini, ita nec salvatio, ideo cum Verbum apud Gentem Judaicam prorsus adulteratum et falsificatum fuit, et inde quasi nullum factum est, ideo placuit Domino venire in mundum, et non modo implere Verbum, sed quoque id redintegrare et restituere, et sic iterum dare lucem incolis hujus telluris, secundum Domini Verba apud Johannem, In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; in Ipso vita erat, et vita erat Lux hominum, et Lux in tenebris apparet: erat Lux vera, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in mundum, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_17/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_17/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_4-5" target=_top>4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_17/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_9" target=_top>9</a>; apud Eundem, Jesus dixit, Ego sum Lux mundi; qui Me sequitur, non ambulabit in tenebris, sed habebit lucem vitae, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_17/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_12" target=_top>8:12</a>; et apud Matthaeum, Populus sedens in tenebris, vidit lumen magnum; sedentibus in regione et umbra mortis, lux exorta illis est, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_17/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_4_16" target=_top>4:16</a>.<p>[5] Quoniam praedictum est, quod in fine hujus Ecclesiae etiam oborirentur tenebrae, ex non cognitione et agnitione Domini, quod sit Deus coeli et terrae, et ex fidei separatione a charitate, et per id genuinus intellectus Verbi periit, ideo placuit Domino nunc revelare sensum spiritualem Verbi, et manifestare quod Verbum in illo sensu agat de Domino et de Ecclesia, imo de illis solis, et plura alia, per quae Lux veri paene exstincta restituatur: quod Lux veri in fine hujus Ecclesiae exstincta esset, intelligitur per Domini verba apud Matthaeum, Statim post afflictionem dierum istorum, Sol obscurabitur, et Luna non dabit lumen suum, et stellae cadent de coelo, et virtutes coelorum commovebuntur: et tunc videbunt Filium hominis venientem in nubibus coeli cum gloria et virtute, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-verbo_17/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_29-30" target=_top>Matthaeum 24:29-30</a>; per Solem ibi intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Amorem, per Lunam Dominus quoad fidem, per stellas Dominus quoad cognitiones boni et veri, per nubes sensus literae Verbi, et per gloriam sensus spiritualis ejus [et] per Filium hominis Dominus quoad Verbum. </p>
