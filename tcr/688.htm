688. The Baptism of John Prepared the Way So That Jehovah God Could Descend into the World and Bring about Redemption
<p>In Malachi we read, "Behold, I am sending my messenger, who will prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire will suddenly come to his temple. Who can endure the day of his coming? Who can remain standing when he appears?" (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1-2</a>). The same book goes on to say, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of Jehovah comes, so that I will not come and strike the earth with a curse" (<a href="3927/malachi_4_5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>). When Zechariah the father is prophesying about his son John, he says, "You, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest. You will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways" (<a href="3927/luke_1_76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>). The Lord himself says about John, "This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you'" (<a href="3927/luke_7_27.htm">Luke 7:27</a>).
<p>These passages make it clear that John was the prophet who was sent to prepare the way for Jehovah God, who was to come down into the world and bring about redemption. They also make it clear that how John prepared the way was through baptizing and also announcing the Coming of the Lord; and that if this preparation had not occurred, all people there would have been struck with a curse and would have perished. </p>

688. VII. By John's baptism the way was prepared for Jehovah the Lord to come down into the world and carry out redemption.<p>We read in Malachi:<p>Look, I am sending my messenger who will prepare the way before me, and suddenly the Lord whom you seek will come to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Who will endure the day of his coming, and who will stand firm when he appears? <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1-2</a>.<p>and again:<p>Look, I shall send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes, so that I may not come and strike the land with a curse, <a href="3927/malachi_4_5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>.<p>When his father Zechariah prophesied about his son John:<p>You, my child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, <a href="3927/luke_1_76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>.<p>The Lord Himself said about John the Baptist:<p>He it is of whom it was written, Look, I am sending my messenger before your <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
face, who will prepare your way in front of you, <a href="3927/luke_7_27.htm">Luke 7:27</a>.<p>It is clear from these passages that John was the prophet who was sent to prepare the way for Jehovah God, so that He could come down into the world and carry out redemption. It is also clear that he prepared that way by baptising, and by announcing the Lord's coming; and that but for that preparation all there would have been struck with a curse and would have perished.<p>

688. VII. BY THE BAPTISM OF JOHN A WAY WAS PREPARED, THAT JEHOVAH THE LORD MIGHT DESCEND INTO THE WORLD AND ACCOMPLISH REDEMPTION. <p>It is written in Malachi: <p>Behold, I send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye long for. Who will abide the day of His coming, and who will stand when He shall appear? (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Conjugial Love 3[1], 2</a>). <p>And again: <p>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse (<a href="3927/malachi_4_5.htm">Conjugial Love 4[5], 6</a>). <p>And Zacharias the father, prophesying of his son John, says: <p>Thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready His ways (<a href="3927/luke_1_76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>). <p>And the Lord Himself says of this same John: <p>This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send My angel before Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee (<a href="3927/luke_7_27.htm">Luke 7:27</a>). <p>From all this it is clear that this John was the prophet sent to make ready the way of Jehovah God, who should descend into the world and accomplish redemption; and that he made ready that way by baptism, and by announcing the coming of the Lord; and that without such preparation all on earth would have been smitten with a curse and would have perished. </p>

Quod per Baptisma Johannis praeparata sit via, ut Jehovah Dominus in Mundum posset descendere, et Redemptionem peragere.<p>Apud Malachiam legitur, Ecce Ego mitto Angelum meum, qui parabit viam ante Me, et subito veniet ad Templum suum Dominus, Quem vos quaeritis, et Angelus foederis, quem vos desideratis; quis sustinebit diem adventus Ipsius, et quis consistet cum apparuerit, <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachias 3:1-2</a>, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
