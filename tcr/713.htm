713. The universal qualities mentioned above also have three opponents: the Devil, evil, and falsity. The Devil (which means hell) is against the Lord; evil is against goodness; and falsity is against truth. These three negative qualities work together. Wherever the Devil is, there you also have evil and falsity.
<p>The three negative characteristics apply, on large and small scales, to all the qualities of hell and also all the qualities of the world that are against heaven and the church. Because they are opposites, they have had to be completely separated [from their positive counterparts]; nevertheless they are kept in some connection through the amazing way in which all parts of hell are placed beneath and subjected to heaven, evil is under the control of goodness, and falsity is under the control of truth. (For more on this arrangement see .) </p>

713. Contrariwise there are three opposites to these universals: the devil, evil and falsity. The devil (by which we mean hell) is in opposition to the Lord, evil is in opposition to good and falsity to truth. These three make one, for where the devil is, there are evil too and the falsity which comes from it. These three also contain at the universal and the particular level everything to do with hell and also the world, which are in opposition to heaven and the church. But being opposites they are therefore totally separate, yet still held in a relationship by the amazing way in which the whole of hell is subject to heaven, evil is subject to good and falsity to truth; this subjection has been described in my book called <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_536.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 536-544</a>. </p>

713. On the other hand there are three universals opposite to these, namely, the devil, evil, and falsity. The devil (which means hell) is directly opposite to the Lord, evil is directly opposite to good, and falsity to truth. These three make one, for where the devil is there also are evil and falsity therefrom. These three also contain both universally and particularly all things of hell as well as all things of the world which are contrary to heaven and the church. As these are opposites they are therefore entirely separate, and yet are retained in connection by a wonderful subordination of all hell to heaven, of evil to good, and of falsity to truth, which subordination is treated of in the work on Heaven and Hell. </p>

713. On the other hand, there are three opposites to those universals, namely, the devil, evil and falsity. The devil, by which is meant hell is in opposition to the Lord, evil to good, and falsity to truth; and these three constitute one, for where the devil is, there also are evil and consequent falsity. These three also contain, both as to universals and as to particulars, all things of hell and also of the world; and these are contrary to heaven and the Church. As they are opposites, they are, therefore, entirely separate; but still they are held in connection by a wonderful subjection of all hell to heaven, of evil to good, and of falsity to truth. This subjection is treated of in Heaven and Hell 538-544. </p>

713. E contra sunt tria Universalibus illis opposita, quae sunt Diabolus, Malum et Falsum; Diabolus per quem intelligitur Infernum, est in opposito contra Dominum; Malum est in opposito contra Bonum, et Falsum contra Verum; haec tria unum faciunt, nam ubi diabolus est, ibi etiam malum et inde falsum est. Haec tria etiam universaliter et singulariter continent omnia Inferni, et quoque omnia Mundi, quae contra Coelum et Ecclesiam sunt. Sed quia opposita sunt, ideo prorsus separata sunt, sed usque continentur in nexu per mirabilem subjectionem totius inferni sub Coelo, mali sub bono, et falsi sub vero, de qua subjectione in Opere de COELO ET INFERNO actum est. </p>
