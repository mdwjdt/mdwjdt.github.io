<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>182</b>. （8）而且，若非主建立一个新天堂和一个新教会，凡有血气的就都不能得救。我们在马太福音中读到：<br />那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，就都不会得救。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">马太福音24:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.22.htm">22</a>）<br />这一章论述了“世代的末了”，“世代的末了”就表示当今教会的终结。因此，“减少那日子”表终结这个教会并创建一个新教会。谁不知道主若不降世施行救赎，凡有血气的就都不能得救？施行救赎表示建造一个新天堂和一个新教会。主在福音书中预言，祂会再次降世（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">马太福音24:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.26.htm">马可福音13:26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.40.htm">路加福音12:40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.27.htm">21:27</a>；以及启示录，尤其最后一章）。我在有关救赎的章节（114－137节）已说明，如今为了拯救人类，主正通过建立一个新天堂、开启一个新教会而施行救赎。<br />若非主建立一个新教会，凡有血气的，就都不能得救。这是一个极大的奥秘。只要那龙及其团伙仍留在他被扔进的灵人界，与神圣真理相结合的神圣良善若不被败坏、歪曲或灭亡，就无法经由灵人界到达世人那里。这就是启示录中这些话的含义：<br />龙被摔到地上，他的使者同他一起被摔下去。只是住在地和海上的有祸了，因为魔鬼气忿忿地下到他们那里去了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.9.htm">启示录12:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.13.htm">13</a>）<br />不过，那龙被扔进地狱之后（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.10.htm">启示录20:10</a>），约翰就看见一个新天新地，并新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">启示录21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">2</a>）。那龙就表示那些持守当今教会之信的人。<br />在灵界，我与那些相信唯信称义的人谈过几次，并告诉他们说，他们的教义是错的，也是荒谬的。这样的教义只会造成属灵事物上的过于自信、瞎眼、沉睡和黑暗，最终导致灵魂死亡。我恳求他们放弃，但得到答复是：“为何放弃？神职人员的学问全仰仗它而优于平信徒。”我说，在这种情况下，他们就不会视灵魂的救赎为目标，而只关注自己名声的优越性。由于他们用圣言的真理来支持他们的虚假信条，从而玷污了它们，所以他们就是那些无底坑的使者，名叫亚巴顿和亚玻伦（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.11.htm">启示录9:11</a>），这些名字表示那些通过全然歪曲圣言摧毁教会之人。不过，他们回应说：“你什么意思？我们的知识使我们成为传那信之奥秘的神谕者，我们通过它如同通过圣所给出回应。所以，我们不是亚玻伦，而是阿波罗。”听到这样的回答，我气愤地说：“如果你们是阿波罗，那你们也是利维坦，你们为首的是扭曲的利维坦，剩下的是伸长的利维坦，神必以祂刚硬有力的大刀刑罚你们（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.1.htm">以赛亚书27:1</a>）。”可他们闻言却笑了起来。</p>

182. (8)事實上, 如果不是主建立一個新的天國和一個新的教會, 無人能存活。
<p>我們讀『馬太福音』:然後必有大災難, 從世界的起頭直到如今, 沒有像這樣的, 將來也不會有。若不減少那日子, 凡有血氣的沒有一個得救(<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">馬太福音24:21-22</a>)。
<p>『馬太福音』這一章是關於"末世", 就是現今教會的末了。"減少那日子"指結束那個教會,開始新的教會。
<p>當然, 每個人都知道若不是主曾降世救贖人類, 凡有血氣的無一得救。"救贖"的表示建造一個新的天國和一個新的教會。
<p>在福音書中, 主曾預言祂會再次降臨(<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">馬太福音24:30-31</a>;<a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">馬可福音13:26</a>;<a href="3927/luke_12_40.htm">路加福音12:40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>; 還有『啟示錄』, 特別是最後一章)。正如我在上一章的第二部分(<a href="114.htm">114-137</a>)所闡述的救贖, 為了拯救人類, 如今主再次施行救贖, 構造一個新的天國, 並建立一個新的教會。
<p>[2]這就是若主不建立一個新的教會, 人類就不能得救的秘密所在。只要龍和它的使者們仍停留在它們被扔下的靈界, 與聖善相連的聖理就不能逃脫歪曲與褻瀆,甚至毀滅, 就無法傳達給地上的人們。就是『啟示錄』以下內容所表達的意思:
<p>龍被摔到地上, 它的使者們同它一起被摔下來。住在地上和海
<p>中的有禍了, 因為魔鬼氣忿忿地下到他們那裡去了(<a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">啟示錄12:9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12-13</a>)。
<p>在龍被扔進地獄之後(<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">啟示錄20:10</a>), 約翰看見一個新的天國和一個新的地, 並見新的耶路撒冷從天由上帝那裡降下(<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">啟示錄21:1-2</a>)。"龍"表示那些持守當今教會之信者。
<p>[3]在靈界, 我好幾次與那些堅持"唯信稱義"者交談。我跟他們說, 這樣的教導是錯的, 也是荒誕的。只會導致屬靈的自滿,瞎眼,休眠和黑夜, 最終帶到靈魂死亡。我力勸他們放棄。
<p>我得到這樣的答覆:"為何放棄？這可是神職人員比平信徒的優越之處啊。"
<p>我說, 這樣只會讓他們看到名聲的優越, 而不關注靈魂的得救。因為他們將聖言的真理去支持他們偽謬歪曲的立場, 因而褻瀆了真理。這就是無底坑中的使者, 被稱為亞巴頓和亞玻倫(<a href="3927/revelation_9_11.htm">啟示錄9:11</a>), 表示那些藉著全然歪曲聖言來抵毀教會者。
<p>"你什麼意思？"他們答道:"我們的知識使我們成為此信奧秘的神諭者, 我們給出的答案如同從聖壇而來。我們不是亞玻倫, 而是阿波羅。"
<p>這話令我有些生氣, 於是我說:"如果你們是阿波羅, 你們也是海怪, 領頭的是盤卷之怪, 跟從的是長條之怪。上帝將以祂剛硬有力的大刀臨到你們(<a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">以賽亞書27:1</a>)。" </p>

182. 8. In fact, if the Lord were not building a new heaven and a new church, the human race would not be preserved. We read in Matthew,
<p>Then there will be a great affliction such as has never existed since the world began until now and will never exist again. In fact, unless those days were cut short no flesh would be preserved. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>)
<p>This chapter in Matthew concerns "the close of the age," which means the end of the modern-day church. "Cutting those days short" means ending that church and starting a new one.
<p>Surely everyone knows that unless the Lord had come into the world and redeemed us, we could not have been saved. "Redeeming us" means constructing a new heaven and a new church.
<p>In the Gospels the Lord predicted that he was going to come into the world again (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>; see also the Book of Revelation, especially in the last chapter). As I have shown above in the second part of the last chapter, on redemption [114-137], today the Lord is again redeeming us, constructing a new heaven, and building a new church for the purpose of saving humankind.
</p>
<p>
[2] Here is the great secret as to why the human race could not be preserved if the Lord were not building a new church. As long as the dragon and its crew stay down in the world of spirits where they were thrown, no divine truth united to divine good can get across to people on earth without being perverted and falsified or ceasing to exist. This is what the Book of Revelation means when it says,
<p>The dragon was thrown down onto the earth and its angels were thrown with it. Woe to those who live on the earth and in the sea, because the Devil has come down to them in a giant rage. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12-13</a>)
<p>It was after the dragon was thrown down into hell (<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>) that John saw a new heaven and a new earth and saw the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>). The "dragon" means those who share the belief of the church today.
</p>
<p>
[3] In the spiritual world I have talked several times with people who say faith alone makes us just. I said that their teaching is wrong and also absurd; it brings on spiritual complacency, blindness, sleep, and night; and it is eventually lethal to the soul. I urged them to give it up.
<p>I received the response, "Why stop? This is the sole reason that the clergy can claim to be better educated than lay people. "
<p>I replied that in that case they must view a superior reputation as their goal, not the saving of souls. Since they have applied the truths in the Word to their own false principles, which means they have contaminated them, they are the angels of the abyss called Abaddons and Apollyons (<a href="3927/revelation_9_11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a>; those names mean people who have destroyed the church by completely falsifying the Word).
<p>They replied, "What? Since we know the mysteries of that faith, we are oracles. We give answers from that faith as if it were a sacred shrine. We are not Apollyons; we are Apollos. "
<p>Irritated at that, I said, "If you are Apollos you are also leviathans. The leaders among you are coiled leviathans, and the followers among you are uncoiled leviathans. God will visit you with his sword, great and strong" (<a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>).
<p>They just laughed at that. </p>

182. (viii) FURTHER, UNLESS A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW CHURCH ARE FOUNDED BY THE LORD, NO FLESH CAN BE SAVED.<p>We read in Matthew:<p>Then there shall be great affliction, such as never was from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be. Indeed, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>.<p>That chapter deals with the completion of the age, by which is meant the end of the present-day church. Therefore 'cutting short those days' means bringing it to an end and setting up a new one. Is there anyone who does not know that if the Lord had not come into the world and carried out the redemption, no flesh could have been saved? Carrying out redemption means founding a new heaven and a new church. The Lord predicted in the Gospels that He would come into the world again (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>), and also in Revelation, especially in the last chapter. I have shown above in the section on Redemption [<a href="114.htm">114-137</a>], that the Lord is carrying out redemption to-day too, founding a new heaven and starting a new church, for the sake of man's salvation.</p>
<p>
[2] The great secret about no flesh being able to be saved, if the Lord had not started a new church, is this. So long as the dragon with his crew stays in the world of spirits, into which he was thrown, no Divine truth united with Divine good can get through to people on earth without being perverted and falsified or being destroyed. This is what is meant by this passage in Revelation:<p>The dragon was cast down to earth, and his angels were cast down with him. Woe to those that live on the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to them having great wrath, <a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12-13</a>.<p>But after the dragon was cast into hell (<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>), then John saw a new heaven and a new earth, and the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>). The dragon means those who hold the faith of the present-day church.</p>
<p>
[3] I have several times in the spiritual world talked with those who believe that man is justified by faith alone, and I have told them that their doctrine is wrong and also absurd; it induces carelessness, blindness, sleep and darkness in spiritual matters, leading to the death of the soul. I have pleaded with them to abandon it. But I got the answer: 'Abandon it? Surely this is the one thing upon which the superiority of the clergy's learning over that of laymen depends.' I replied that in that case the salvation of souls was no part of their purpose, but only the superiority of their reputations. Because they had used the truths of the Word to support their false principles, thus adulterating them, they were angels of the abyss, those called Abaddons and Apollyons <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
(<a href="3927/revelation_9_11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a>), by whom are meant those who destroy the church by totally falsifying the Word. 'What do you mean?' they replied; 'our knowledge makes us oracles of the mysteries of that faith, and we give its replies as if from a shrine. So we are not Apollyons, but Apollos.' This made me cross and I said: 'If you are Apollos, you are also leviathans, your first rank twisted leviathans, the second elongated leviathans, whom God will visit with His hard and mighty sword (<a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>). But at this they laughed.<p>

<p>
182. (8) So, too, unless a new heaven and a new church were established by the Lord there could no flesh be saved. It is said in Matthew: <p>Then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days be shortened no flesh would be saved (24<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">:21, 22</a>). <p>This chapter treats of "the consummation of the age," by which the end of the present church is meant; therefore "to shorten those days" means to bring that church to an end and establish a new one. Who does not know that unless the Lord had come into the world and wrought redemption no flesh could have been saved? To work redemption means to found a new heaven and a new church. That the Lord would again come into the world He foretold in the Gospels,<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30, 31</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>; and in the Apocalypse, particularly in the last chapter. That He is also effecting a redemption at this day by founding a new heaven and establishing a new church to the end that man may be saved, has been shown above in the chapter on Redemption.
</p>
<p>
[2] The great mystery that unless a new church is established by the Lord no flesh can he saved, is this: That so long as the dragon with his horde remains in the world of spirits into which he has been cast, no Divine truth united to Divine good can pass through that world to men on earth without being perverted and falsified, or without its perishing. This is what is meant in the Apocalypse by the words: <p>The dragon was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down unto them having great anger (12<a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">:9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12, 13</a>). <p>But when the dragon had been cast into hell (1<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">20:10</a>), <p>John saw a new heaven and a new earth, and he saw the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1, 2</a>); <p>"the dragon" meaning those who are in the faith of the present church.
</p>
<p>
[3] In the spiritual world I have several times talked with those who believe that men are justified by faith alone; and I have told them that their doctrine is both erroneous and absurd, and induces upon men security, blindness, sleep, and in spiritual things a night, and consequently death to the soul; and I have exhorted them to discard it; but I received the answer, "Why discard it? Does not the superiority of the learning of the clergy over that of the laity hang upon that sole doctrine?" I replied, "In that case they do not regard the salvation of souls as any object, but the superiority of their own reputation; and as they have adapted the truths of the Word to their false principles, and have thus adulterated them, they are those angels of the abyss, called Abaddons and Apollyons (<a href="3927/revelation_9_11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a>), who signify those that destroy the church by a total falsification of the Word." But they made answer, "What do you mean? By our knowledge of the mysteries of that faith we are oracles, and from it as from a sanctuary we give responses; therefore we are not Apollyons but Apollos." Indignant at this reply I said, "If you are Apollos you are also leviathans - your leaders the crooked leviathans, and the rest of you the stretched-out leviathans, whom God will visit with His sore and great sword" (<a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>). But at this they laughed. </p>

182. (8) FOR THE SAME REASON, UNLESS A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH WERE ESTABLISHED BY THE LORD, NO FLESH SHOULD BE SAVED.<p>It is written in Matthew:<p>"Then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved" <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">24:21-22</a>.<p>This chapter treats of the consummation of the age, by which is meant the end of the present Church; therefore, by shortening those days is meant bringing it to an end and establishing a new one. Who does not know that unless the Lord had come into the world and accomplished redemption no flesh could have been saved? and to accomplish redemption means to form a new heaven and a New Church. That the Lord would come again into the world He foretold in the Evangelists:<p><a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_28.htm">Mark 13:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>;<p>and in the Revelation, particularly in the last chapter. It has also been shown above in the section on redemption that He is to-day accomplishing the work of redemption, by forming a new heaven and establishing a new church in order that man may be saved.</p>
<p>
[2] There is a great truth, hitherto unknown, underlying the fact that unless a New Church is established by the Lord no flesh can be saved. This is, that as long as the dragon with his crew remained in the world of spirits, into which he was cast, it was impossible for any Divine truth conjoined with Divine good to pass through to men on earth, without being perverted and falsified, or destroyed. This is what is meant in the Revelation by these Words:<p>The dragon "was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him... Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto them (A.V., you), having great wrath <a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">12:9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12-13</a>.<p>But when the dragon was cast into hell, <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">20:10</a>, then John saw the new heaven and the new earth, and the New Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven, <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1-2</a>.<p>By the dragon are meant those who are in the faith of the present Church.<p>MEMORABILIA.<p>I have sometimes conversed in the spiritual world with those who hold the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and I have told them that their doctrine is erroneous and absurd, that it induces carelessness, blindness, sleep and night in spiritual matters, and consequently brings death to the soul. I exhorted them to give it up, but I received the reply: "Why give it up? The superiority of the learning of the clergy over that of the laity depends solely upon this doctrine." But I answered that they evidently did not regard the salvation of souls as an end in view, but the superiority of their own reputation; and therefore, because they applied the truths of the Word to their own false principles, and thus defiled them, they were angels of the abyss, called Abaddons and Apollyons, <a href="3927/revelation_9_11.htm">Revelation 9:11</a>, by whom are signified those who destroy the Church by the complete falsification of the Word. But they replied: "How can this be? By our knowledge of the mysteries of this faith we are oracles, and from this faith as from a shrine we deliver responses; and so we are not Apollyons but Apollos." <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
Indignant at this I said: "If you are Apollos you are also leviathans. The chief among you are crooked leviathans, and those lower in station are piercing leviathans, <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>

et APOLLYONES, <a href="3927/revelation_9_11.htm">Apocalypsis 9:11</a>, per quos significantur Perditores Ecclesiae per totalem falsificationem Verbi; sed responderunt, quid hoc; sumus per scientiam mysteriorum illius fidei Oracula, et ex illa ut ex adyto reddimus responsa, quare non sumus Apollyones sed APOLLINES; ex his indignatus dixi, si estis Apollines, estis etiam LEVIATHANES, primi vestrum Leviathanes tortuosi, et secundi vestrum Leviathanes oblongi, quos Deus gladio suo duro et magno visitabit, <a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">Esaias 27:1</a> sed ad haec riserunt.<p>
