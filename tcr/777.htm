777. The Lord is the Word, as is very clear from the following statement in John:
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)
<p>In this passage the Word means divine truth, because the Word is the only source of divine truth for Christians. The Word is the spring from which all the churches named for Christ draw living water in all its fullness. Admittedly, the church is in a cloud when it focuses on the Word's earthly meaning; but it is in glory and power when it focuses on the Word's spiritual and heavenly meaning. (The fact that the Word contains three levels of meaning, the earthly meaning, the spiritual meaning inside that earthly meaning, and the heavenly meaning inside that spiritual meaning, has been demonstrated in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture and in the chapter on the Ten Commandments or the catechism.)
<p>This makes it clear that "the Word" in John means divine truth. John gives further testimony to the same effect in his first Epistle:
<p>We know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, so that we may know the truth. And we are in the truth in his Son Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>)
<p>This is also why the Lord often says, "Amen I say to you. " "Amen" in Hebrew means "the truth. " In fact, the Lord is "the Amen" (see <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>) and "the Truth" (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).
<p>When you ask church scholars of today what "the Word" means in <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, they say it means "the supreme power of the Word. " What else gives the Word supreme power but its divine truth?
</p>
<p>
[2] All this makes it clear that the Lord is now going to appear in the Word.
<p>The reason he will not be appearing in person is that ever since he ascended into heaven, he has been in his glorified human manifestation. In this he cannot appear before any human beings unless he has first opened the eyes of their spirit. The eyes of the spirit cannot be opened in people who are engaged in evils and falsities - in any of the goats, whom he placed on his left [<a href="3927/matthew_25_33.htm">Matthew 25:33</a>]. Therefore whenever he showed himself to his disciples, he first opened their eyes. We read, "And their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he became invisible to them" (<a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). A similar thing happened with the women who were by his tomb after he had risen; this is why they were able to see angels sitting in the tomb and hear them speaking with them. No one can see angels through physical eyes.
<p>Even before the Lord rose, it was not the apostles' physical eyes but their spiritual eyes that saw the Lord in his glorified human manifestation; after they came out of that state, they appeared to themselves to have been asleep. This is clear from the Lord's transfiguration in the presence of Peter, James, and John and the fact that they were then "heavy with sleep" (<a href="3927/luke_9_32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). Therefore it is foolish to believe that the Lord is going to appear in person in a cloud of heaven; instead he is going to appear in the Word, since the Word is from him, and he is the Word. </p>

777. It is plain from the following passage in John that the Lord is the Word:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; and the Word became flesh, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The Word in that passage is Divine truth, because Christians have no other source of Divine truth than the Word. It is the source from which all the churches named after Christ draw an abundance of living waters, and although they are as it were in a cloud containing its natural sense, yet they are in the glory and power which contain its spiritual and celestial senses. The Word contains three senses, the natural, the spiritual and the celestial, one inside the next, as was shown in the chapters on the Sacred Scripture and the Ten Commandments or Catechism [chapters 4-5]. From this it is obvious that the Word as used in John means Divine truth. John gives further evidence of this same fact in his First Epistle:<p>We know that the Son of God came and gave us understanding, so that we might know the truth; and we are in the truth, in his Son Jesus Christ. <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>That too was why the Lord said so often 'Amen, I say to you'; Amen in Hebrew means truth. He is Himself the Amen (see <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>) and truth (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>If you ask the scholars of the present time what they understand by the Word in <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, they say it is 'the Word in its pre-eminence'; and what else is the Word in its pre-eminence but Divine truth?</p>

<p>
[2] From this it is clear that the Lord is even now about to appear in the Word. The reason why He will not appear in person is that after His ascension into heaven He is in His glorified Human; and in this He cannot appear to any person, unless He has first opened the eyes of his spirit. This is impossible with anyone who is in a state of evils and consequent falsities, and so with any of the goats, whom He has placed on the left. Therefore, when He showed Himself to the disciples, He first opened their eyes; for we read:<p>And their eyes were opened, and they recognised Him; but He became invisible to them, <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>.<p>Much the same happened with the women near the tomb after the resurrection. That is why then too they saw angels sitting in the tomb and speaking to them, something no one can see with his material eyes. Neither did the Apostles see the Lord with the eyes of their bodies before His resurrection in His glorified Human; but they saw Him in the spirit, something which seems like seeing in sleep after waking up. This is clear from His transfiguration in front of Peter, James and John, when we read that they were then heavy with sleep (<a href="3927/luke_9_32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). It is futile therefore to believe that the Lord will appear in a cloud of heaven in person; but He will appear in the Word, which is from Him and which He is. </p>

777. That the Lord is the Word can be clearly seen from the following in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. And the Word was made flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). <p>"The Word" means here Divine truth because Divine truth among Christians is from no other source than the Word, which is the fountain from which all churches bearing the name of Christ draw living waters in their fullness; and yet a church accepting the Word in its natural sense is, as it were, in a cloud, but one accepting it in its spiritual and celestial senses is in glory and power. That there are three senses in the Word, a natural, a spiritual, and a celestial, one within the other, has been shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, and in the chapter on the Decalogue or Catechism. From all this it is clear that "the Word" in John means Divine truth. John also bears testimony to this in his first Epistle: <p>We know that the Son of God hath come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">5:20</a>). <p>This is why the Lord so frequently said, "Verily I say unto you," verily [amen] in the Hebrew language meaning truth (That He is "the Amen" see<a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, and "the Truth"<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>) Moreover, when the learned men of the present day are asked what they understand by "the Word" in John (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>), they say that it means the Word in its preeminence; yet what is the Word in its preeminence but Divine truth? From all this it is evident that the Lord is now to appear in the Word. He is not to appear in Person, because since He ascended into heaven He is in His glorified Human, and in this He cannot appear to any man unless the eyes of his spirit are first opened; and this cannot be done in anyone who is in evils and consequent falsities, thus not in any of the goats whom He sets on His left hand. Therefore when He showed Himself to His disciples, He first opened their eyes, for it is written: <p>And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him and He vanished out of their sight (<a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). <p>The same took place with the women who were at the sepulchre after the resurrection, and in consequence they also saw angels sitting in the sepulchre and talking with them, and angels cannot be seen with the material eye. Neither did the apostles before the resurrection see the Lord in His glorified Human with their bodily eyes, but in spirit, which seems, after one is awakened from it, like the state of sleep. This is evident from the Lord's transfiguration before Peter, James, and John, for it is said, <p>That they were heavy with sleep (<a href="3927/luke_9_32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). <p>It is idle therefore, to believe that the Lord will appear in the clouds of heaven in Person; but He is to appear in the Word, which is from Him and therefore is Himself. </p>

777. That the Lord is the Word is clearly evident from these words in John,<p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... and the Word was made flesh" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The Word in this passage is Divine Truth, because Christians have Divine Truth from no other source than the Word. This is the fountain whence all Churches taking their name from Christ draw living waters in their fullness, although as in a cloud which overshadows its natural sense, but in glory and power which belong to its spiritual and to its celestial sense. It has been shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, and in the chapter on the Decalogue or Catechism, that there are three senses in the Word, the natural, the spiritual and the celestial, one within the other. It is clear, therefore, that the Word in John means Divine Truth. John also bears witness to the same in his First Epistle:<p>"We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know the truth (A.V., Him that is true); and we are in the truth (A.V., Him that is true), even in His Son Jesus Christ" <a href="3927/john_5_20.htm">John 5:20</a>.<p>It is for this reason that the Lord so often said, "Amen I say unto you;" for Amen in Hebrew means truth; and that He is the Amen may be seen in <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>; and the Truth in <a href="3927/john_14_8.htm">John 14:8</a>. When the learned of today are asked what they understand by the Word in <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, they reply that they understand the Word in its pre-eminence; and what is the Word in its pre-eminence but Divine Truth? From these considerations it is evident that the Lord will now appear in the Word.<p>The reason why He will not appear in person is that, since His ascension into heaven, He is in His glorified Human; and in this He cannot appear to any man unless the eyes of his spirit are first opened. This cannot be done in the case of any one who is in evils and in the falsities that arise from them; thus not in the case of the goats whom He sets on His left hand. Therefore, when He showed Himself to His disciples, He first opened their eyes, for it is written,<p>"And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him: and He vanished out of their sight" <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>.<p>It was the same with the women at the sepulchre after the resurrection; for then they saw angels sitting in the sepulchre, talking with them; and yet no one can see angels with the material eyes. It is evident from the account of His Transfiguration before Peter, James and John that the apostles before the Lord's resurrection did not see Him in His glorified Human with their bodily eyes, but while they were in the spirit; for it is written,<p>"They were heavy with sleep" <a href="3927/luke_9_32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>.<p>After waking from this state of the spirit what has been seen appears like the vision of a dream. It is vain, therefore, to suppose that the Lord will appear in the clouds of heaven in person: He will appear in the Word, which is from Him, and is thus Himself. </p>

Quod Dominus sit Verbum, manifeste constat ex his apud Johannem, "In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum, et Verbum Caro factum est," Cap. <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. Quod Verbum ibi sit Divinum Verum, est quia Divinum Verum Christianis non aliunde est, quam ex Verbo, quod est Fons, a quo omnes Ecclesiae a Christo nominatae aquas vivas hauriunt in sua plenitudine, tametsi sicut in nube, in qua Sensus ejus naturalis est, ast in gloria et virtute in qua Sensus spiritualis et coelestis ejus est; quod in Verbo sint tres Sensus, Naturalis, spiritualis et Coelestis, unus interior altero, in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA, et in Capite de DECALOGO seu CATECHISMO, ostensum est; inde patet quod per Verbum apud Johannem intelligatur Divinum Verum; idem etiam adhuc testatur Johannes in sua Prima Epistola, "Scimus quod Filius Dei venerit, et dederit nobis INTELLECTUM, ut cognoscamus VERUM, et sumus in VERO, in Filio Ipsius Jesu Christo," <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">5:20</a>. Et ideo Dominus toties dixit, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
AMEN dico vobis, et Amen in Lingua Hebraea est Veritas, et quod Ipse sit AMEN, videatur <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Apocalypsis 3:14</a>, ac VERITAS, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">Johannes 14:6</a>.

[2] Ex his patet, quod Dominus etiam nunc appariturus sit in Verbo; quod non in Persona, est causa quia post ascensum Ipsius in Coelum, est in Humano glorificato, et in hoc non potest apparere ulli homini, nisi prius aperiat oculos Spiritus ejus, et hic non potest aperiri apud ullum qui in malis et inde falsis est, ita non apud ullos hircos, quos statuit ad sinistrum; quare cum manifestavit se discipulis, prius aperuit oculos illorum, nam legitur, "Et illorum aperti sunt oculi, et cognoverunt Ipsum, at Ipse invisibilis factus est ab illis," <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luca 24:31</a>. Simile factum est cum Mulieribus juxta Sepulchrum post resurrectionem, quare etiam tunc viderunt Angelos in sepulchro sedentes, et loquentes cum illis, quos nec ullus homo materiali oculo videre potest. Quod nec Apostoli ante resurrectionem Domini in Humano glorificato oculis corporis Dominum viderint, sed in spiritu, quod apparet post evigilationem sicut in somno, constat ex transformatione Ipsius coram Petro, Jacobo et Johanne, quod tunc gravati sint somno, <a href="3927/luke_9_32.htm">Luca 9:32</a>. Quare vanum est credere, quod Dominus appariturus sit in nube Coeli in Persona, sed quod in Verbo, quod est ex Ipso, ita Ipse.<p>
