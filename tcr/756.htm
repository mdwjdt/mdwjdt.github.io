756. “世界的末了”可通过尘世的各种事物来说明, 因为地上的每一个事物都会衰退并腐朽, 但以交替变化的形式进行, 也就是所谓的循环。 时间, 无论总体还是细节, 就经历这些循环。 总体上, 年是从春到夏, 从夏到秋, 然后终止于冬, 再从冬回到春; 这是热的循环。 细节上, 天是从晨到午, 从午到暮, 然后终止于夜, 再从夜回到晨; 这是光的循环。 每个人也经历这样的自然循环, 其生命历程从婴儿开始, 由此成长到青少年与成年, 再由此到老年, 然后死亡。 一切空中的鸟, 地上的兽也是一样。 同样, 一切树木始于幼芽, 再继续生长至完全, 然后逐渐凋零, 直到枯萎。 一切灌木与植物, 甚至每片叶子, 每朵花也是这样, 土地本身会随着时间推移变得贫瘠, 一切静止的水会逐渐浑浊。 所有这些事物的终结都是交替进行的, 是自然和暂时的, 然而也是周期性的; 因为当一个事物从起源走向终结后, 类似于它的另一个事物就会兴起; 因此, 万物皆出生, 死亡, 再出生, 以便创造可以持续下去。 教会的情形几乎一样, 因为一个人就是一个教会, 并且总体上构成教会, 一代接着又一代, 每一代的性情都不一样; 罪孽一旦根深蒂固, 即有了对它的倾向, 就会传给后代, 并且只有通过唯独主所带来的重生才能被灭绝。 </p>

756. Various things in the physical world can serve to illustrate the close of the age. Each and every thing on earth grows old and becomes worn out through patterns that recur, which are called cycles; both long and short spans of time go through these cycles. In a longer cycle, the year goes from spring to summer and on into fall, and comes to an end in winter. After winter, spring comes again. This cycle relates to heat. In a shorter cycle, the day goes from morning to afternoon and on into evening, and comes to an end in the night. After night, morning comes again. This cycle relates to light.
<p>We ourselves also go through a natural cycle like this. We begin our lives as a child; we come into youth and adulthood, and move on into old age. Then we die. Every bird in the sky and every animal on earth goes through the same kind of cycle as well.
<p>Every tree begins as a shoot, grows up to its full height, and then weakens progressively until it falls over. Every bush and shrub goes through a similar cycle; in fact, every leaf and every flower blossom goes through one as well. Even the ground itself goes through something similar; in time it becomes unproductive. Water, too, that is not moving becomes more and more stagnant.
<p>These are all examples of end times that recur. They are physical and time-bound, and yet the cycle comes around again. When the cycle comes to an end, it begins again. Every type of thing, then, is being born, and is dying, and is being born again. The purpose of all this is to ensure that creation continues.
<p>The same thing happens with a church, for the reason that humankind is the church and constitutes it in a multigenerational way. One generation follows another. Human minds are always changing and different. Once wickedness is rooted in one generation, it is passed on to the next in the form of a tendency toward that wickedness. It is not uprooted except through the process of regeneration, which is something only the Lord can do for us. </p>

756. The natural world contains various things which can illustrate the ending of the age. For here every single thing upon the earth grows old and reaches its end, but in successive alternations known as cycles. Periods of time are cyclical, both in general and in detail. In general, the year advances from spring to summer, through this to autumn and comes to an end in winter, from which it returns to spring; this is the heat cycle. In detail, the day advances from morning to noon, through this to evening and comes to an end in night, from which it returns again to morning; this is the light cycle. Every human being too goes through a natural cycle. He begins his life from childhood, advances to adolescence and early adulthood, from which he passes into old age, and dies. Likewise every bird of the sky, and every beast of the earth. Every tree too begins with a shoot, grows to full size and little by little wastes away, until it falls. The same thing happens to every shrub and plant, in fact to every leaf and flower, as well as to the ground itself, which in course of time becomes barren. The same happens to every stretch of still water, which little by little becomes foul. All of these endings are alternating, being natural and temporary, but they show periodicity. For when one passes from its beginning to its end, another like it arises. So everything is born and wastes away, and is born again, so that creation may continue in existence. The reason why much the same happens to the church is that people are a church, and on the general level compose it. One generation takes the place of another, and every mind is different. Wickedness once rooted in the character is transferred to descendants as a propensity to wickedness; and it cannot be rooted out except by regeneration, which only the Lord can bring about. </p>

756. The consummation of the age can be illustrated by various things in the natural world, for here each and all things on the earth grow old and decay, but by alternate changes which are called the circles of things. Times in general and in particular pass through these circles. In general, the year passes from spring to summer, through this to autumn, then ends in winter, and from this returns to spring; this is the circle of heat. In particular, the day passes from morning to noon, through this to evening, and ends in night, and from this returns again to morning; this is the circle of light. Again, every man runs through the circle of nature, beginning life in infancy, advancing therefrom to youth and manhood, from this to old age, and dies. So likewise every bird of the air and every beast of the earth. Also, every tree begins with a germ, goes on to its full stature, and gradually declines until it falls. The same is true of every bush and every shrub, and even of every leaf and flower, also of the soil itself, which in time becomes barren; and of all still water which gradually becomes foul. All these are alternative consummations, which are natural and temporal, and yet periodical; because when one has passed from its origin to its end, another like it arises; thus everything is born and dies and is born again, in order that creation may be continued. This is like what takes place in the church because man is a church and in general constitutes the church, and one generation follows another with a constant variation of disposition; and iniquity once enrooted, that is, an inclination to it, is transmitted to posterity, and is extirpated by regeneration only, which is wrought by the Lord alone. </p>

756. The consummation of the age may be illustrated by various things in the natural world. Here all things, comprising those that are comprehensive wholes as well as those that are individual parts, grow old and waste away; but by alternating changes called cycles. Periods of time run through these cycles in comprehensive wholes as well as in individual parts. Take an example of such a whole. A year passes from spring to summer, through this to autumn and closes in winter; from this it returns again to spring, completing the cycle of heat. Take the case of an individual part. A day passes from morning to noon, through this to evening and closes in night; from this it returns again to morning, completing the cycle of light. Every man passes through the cycle of nature; he begins life in infancy, from this he advances to youth and manhood, from this to old age, and then he dies; so, too, with every bird and every beast of the earth. Every tree also begins from the germ, proceeds to its full growth, and gradually declines till it falls. So it is with every bush and with every twig, and indeed with every leaf and flower, and even with the soil itself which in time becomes barren; and also with all still water, which gradually becomes foul.<p>All these are alternating consummations, taking place according to nature and in the course of time, but still they are periodical; for when one thing has passed from its beginning to its end, another similar to it springs up. Thus every thing is born, and dies, and then is born again, to the end that creation may be continued. The case is the same with the Church, because a man is a Church, and a community of men constitutes the Church; and one generation follows another while the minds of all show great diversity. So iniquity, once it is rooted in their inclination to it, is transmitted to posterity; and it can be extirpated only by regeneration, which is effected by the Lord alone. </p>

756. Consummatio Saeculi illustrari potest per varia in Mundo naturali; in hoc enim omnia et singula, quae super Tellure sunt, antiquantur et consumuntur, sed per vices alternas, quae vocantur Circuli rerum; hos percurrunt tempora in communi et in parte; in Communi, transit Annus a vere in aestatem, et per hanc in autumnum, et desinit in hyemem, et ab hac redit in ver, sed hic circulus est caloris; in Parte, transit Dies a mane in meridiem, et per hanc in vesperam, et desinit in noctem, et ex hac redit in mane, at hic circulus est lucis. Omnis etiam homo percurrit naturae circulum; inchoat vitam ab infantia, e qua progreditur in adolescentiam et juventutem, et ab hac in senectam, et moritur: consimiliter omnis avis coeli, et omnis bestia terrae. Omnis etiam arbor incipit a germine, procedit ad staturam plenam, et successive denascitur, usque dum cadit. Simile fit cum omni arbusto et cum omni virgulto, imo cum omni folio et flore, et quoque cum ipsa humo, quae tempore sterilis fit; ut et cum omni aqua quiescente, quae successive putrescit. Omnia haec sunt Consummationes alternae, quae naturales et temporariae, sed usque periodicae, nam dum unum a sua origine ad finem transivit, simile alterum exoritur, ita unumquodvis nascitur et denascitur, ac iterum nascitur, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
propter finem ut continuetur creatio. Quod simile fiat cum Ecclesia, est quia homo est illa, et in communi facit illam, ac una generatio sequitur alteram, et omnium animorum varietas est, et iniquitas semel irradicata quoad inclinationem ad illam traducitur in posteritatem, et illa non exstirpatur nisi quam per regenerationem, quae a solo Domino fit.<p>
