785. As for the point that everything has both an inner and an outer level, and that the outer level is dependent on the inner level as a body is dependent on its soul, many things in our world serve to illustrate this, when they are thought about in the right way.
<p>This is obvious in the case of humankind. Our entire body serves our mind. Therefore there is an inner and an outer aspect to everything we do and say. The part of our mind called the will is present in every action we take, and the part of our mind called the intellect is present in every word we say. Our awareness, too, has two levels.
<p>Every type of bird and animal and even every type of worm and insect has an inner and an outer level. So does every type of tree, plant, and sprout and even every type of stone and dirt in the ground.
<p>A brief comment about silkworms, bees, and the dirt in the ground will be enough to illustrate this. The inner level in a silkworm is what drives its outer level to make silk and then to take to the air as a moth. The inner level in a bee is what drives its outer level to drink in the ingredients for honey from flowers and to build cells into amazing structures. The inner level of the dirt in the ground is what drives its outer level to support the germination of seeds by exhaling something from the center of each little piece of dirt, which penetrates into the center of the seed, causes it to sprout, and supports the growth of the plant even to the production of new seeds.
<p>The same is also true of their opposites. These, too, have an inner and an outer level. Take, for example, a spider. It has an inner level that drives its outer level; its inner level is its faculty and inclination to make a clever web and sit in the middle of it in order to capture and eat the flies that get caught in it. The same two levels exist in every harmful insect, every type of snake, and every predatory animal in the forest. The same is also true of every godless, insidious, and deceitful human being. </p>

785. Everything has an internal and an external, and the external is dependent upon the internal, as the body is on the soul; a correct appreciation of matters known in the world will establish this. It is obvious in human beings: the whole human body comes from the mind, and hence everything which comes from the human being has an internal and an external. Willing on the part of the mind is present in every action, understanding on the part of the mind in every utterance, and likewise in every sense-perception. Every bird and every animal, even every insect and worm, has an internal and an external. So has every tree, plant and shoot, even every stone and particle of dust of the ground. A few examples will be sufficient to illustrate this, the silk-worm, the bee and dust. It is the silk-worm's internal which impels its external to fashion silk, and later to fly off as a butterfly. It is the bee's internal which impels its external to suck honey out of flowers, and to construct such wonderfully shaped cells. It is the internal of the dust of the ground which impels its external; it makes an effort to germinate seeds, exhaling from within itself something which enters the inmost of the seed, and makes it grow. This internal attends upon its vegetation until new seed is produced. Much the same happens in contrary examples, which also have an internal and an external. For instance in the case of the spider, whose internal which impels its external is an ability and so an inclination to construct a cunning web, in the middle of which it lies in wait for flies to be caught in it, so as to eat them. There is something similar in every noxious worm, and in every snake, as well as in every wild beast of the forest. It is similar in the case of every irreligious, crafty and deceitful person. </p>

785. That there is in everything an internal and an external, and that the external depends on the internal as the body does on its soul, every single thing in the world shows when it is properly examined. In man this is manifest. As his entire body is from his mind, so in each thing that proceeds from man there is an internal and an external; in his every action there is the mind's will, and in his every word the mind's understanding, so also in his every sensation. In every bird and beast, and even in every insect and worm, there is an internal and an external; and again in every tree, plant, and germ, and even in every stone and every particle of soil. A few facts relating to the silk-worm, the bee, and dust, will suffice to make this clear. The internal of the silk-worm is that whereby its external is moved to weave its cocoon, and afterward to fly forth as a butterfly. The internal of the bee is that whereby its external is moved to suck honey from flowers, and to build its cells in wonderful forms. The internal of a particle of soil whereby its external is moved, is its endeavor to fecundate seed; it exhales from its little bosom something which introduces itself into the inmosts of the seed, and produces this effect; and this internal follows the growth of the seed even to new seed. The same takes place in things of an opposite character, in which there is also an internal and an external; as in the spider, whose internal, whereby its external is moved, is the ability and consequent inclination to construct an ingenious web, at the center of which it lies in wait for the flies that fly into it, which it eats. It is the same with every noxious worm, every serpent, and every beast of the forest; as also with every impious, cunning, and treacherous man. </p>

785. That there is in every thing an internal and an external, and that the external depends on the internal, as the body does on the soul, is evident from every single thing in the world, if rightly considered. In the case of man, this is evident. His whole body is dependent on his mind, and consequently there is an internal and an external in whatever proceeds from him. In every action there is the will of his mind, and in every word there is the understanding, also of his mind; and so, too, with each of his senses. There is an internal and an external in every bird and beast, indeed in every insect and creeping thing; and also in every tree, plant and shoot, indeed in every stone and particle of earth. Some particulars concerning the silkworm, the bee and dust serve to illustrate this. The internal of the silkworm induces its external to spin silk and afterwards to fly forth as a butterfly. The internal of the bee induces its external to suck honey from flowers, and to construct its cells in a wonderful form. The internal of a particle of earth, from which its external proceeds, is its tendency to make seeds fertile. It exhales from its inmost recess something which insinuates itself into the inmost parts of the seed. It brings this something forth, and the internal thus attends the development of the seed even to the formation of new seed. The same is true in forms of an opposite nature, which also have both an internal and an external, as in the case of the spider. Its internal, from which its external proceeds, consists in the faculty, and consequent inclination to construct an ingenious web, that it may lie in wait in its centre for the flies that come into it, on which it feeds. The same is true of every noxious grub, of every serpent, and wild beast of the forest. It is also true of every impious, crafty and deceitful man. </p>

785. Quod in omni re Internum et Externum sit, et quod externum pendeat ab interno, sicut corpus a sua anima, constat ex singulis in Mundo rite lustratis: apud hominem hoc manifestum est; universum ejus corpus ex mente ejus, et inde in singulis, quae procedunt ab homine, est internum et externum; in omni actione ejus est Voluntas mentis, et in <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
omni loquela est Intellectus mentis, similiter in omni ejus Sensu. In omni ave et bestia, imo in omni insecto et verme, est internum et externum; tum etiam in omni arbore, planta et germine, imo in omni lapide et pulvisculo humi; ad illustrandum hoc, sufficiunt aliqua, de bombyce, ape et pulvere; internum bombycis est, ex quo fertur externum ejus ad concinnandum sericum, et postea ad evolandum ut papilio. Internum apis est, ex quo fertur externum ejus, ad sugendum mel ex floribus, et ad struendum cellas in mirabiles formas: Internum pulvisculi humi, ex quo fertur externum ejus, est ejus nisus ad foecundandum semina, exhalat ex sinulo suo aliquod, quod se infert in intima seminis, et hoc producit, et illud internum sequitur vegetationem ejus usque ad novum semen. Simile fit in oppositis, in quibus etiam est internum et externum, sicut in aranea, cujus internum, ex quo fertur externum ejus, est facultas et inde inclinatio ad struendum telam artificiosam, e cujus medio insidietur muscis involantibus, quas comedit; parile est in omni alio verme noxio, tum in omni serpente, et quoque in omni fera sylvae: similiter in omni homine impio, astuto et doloso.<p>
