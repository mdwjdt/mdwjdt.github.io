<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第39节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>39</b>.⑶爱本身和智慧本身是生命本身，或本为生命。约翰福音中说到：道与神同在，道就是神。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“神”在此表示圣爱，“道”表示圣智。圣智是真生命，生命是灵界太阳所放射的真光，而耶和华神就在这太阳当中。圣爱形成生命，如同火形成光。火有两个属性：燃烧和发光。热是从燃烧的属性发出的，而光则是从发光的属性发出的。同样，爱也有两个属性，一个与火燃烧的属性相对应，是从至内在作用于人意愿的某种事物；另一个则与发光的属性相对应，是从至内在作用于人理解力的某种事物。这就是人的爱与智慧的源头。如我在前面数次说明的，灵界太阳所放射的热本质上是爱，所放射的光本质上是智慧。这二者流入宇宙的每一个事物中，并从至内在影响它们。就人类而言，这二者流入其意愿和理解力中，因为它们被造为流注的容器：意愿是爱的容器，理解力是智慧的容器。因此，显而易见，人的生命居于他的理解力中，并与他的智慧一致，而意愿之爱则调整它。</p>

39. (3)仁之本和智之本就是生命之本,或生命在本身之中。
<p>『約翰福音』說:"道與上帝同在, 道是上帝。生命在祂裡頭, 這生命就是人的光"(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>)。"上帝"在此指聖仁, "道"指聖智。聖智實際上是生命, 生命實際上是圍繞著耶和華上帝的心靈世界太陽發射的光。
<p>聖仁產生生命, 如同火產生光。火有兩個性能:燃燒和照耀。燃燒發出熱, 照耀發出光。同理, 愛有兩個性能。火燃燒的性能對應其中之一, 就是某些東西在最深之處影響我們的意志。火照耀的性能對應另一個, 是某些東西在至深處影響我們的認知。這就是我們意志和認知的源頭; 因為從心灵世界太陽發出的熱, 本質就是仁愛, 它的光本質上是智慧。此仁此智流入宇宙每個及所有事物之中, 並最深層次地影響他們。至於我們, 此仁此智流入我們的意志和認知之中, 兩者被造為容器來接收——意志接收仁爱, 認知接收智慧。
<p>因此, 可知道以下三點:生命在我們的認知之中找到棲息之地; 那生命幾乎與我們的智慧一樣; 意志之中的仁愛改善那生命。 </p>

39. 3. Because God is love itself and wisdom itself, he is life itself, or life in itself. The Gospel of John says, The Word was with God, and the Word was God. In it there was life, and that life was the light for humankind (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>). "God" in this case means divine love, and "the Word" means divine wisdom. Divine wisdom is actually life, and life is actually the light that radiates from the sun in the spiritual world - the sun that surrounds Jehovah God.
<p>Divine love produces life the way fire produces light. Fire has two qualities: burning and shining. Its burning radiates heat and its shining radiates light. Likewise love has two qualities. The burning quality of fire corresponds to one of them; it is something that affects our will at the deepest level. The shining quality of fire corresponds to the other; it is something that affects our intellect at the deepest level. This is where our love and intelligence come from, because, as I have said several times now, the heat that radiates from the sun in the spiritual world is essentially love, and its light is essentially wisdom. That love and that wisdom flow into each and every thing in the universe and affect them at the deepest level. In us, they flow into our will and intellect; both were created as vessels to receive what flows in, the will as a vessel for love and the intellect as a vessel for wisdom.
<p>From all this three points emerge: that our life finds its home in our intellect; that that life is only as good as our wisdom; and that that life is modified by the love in our will. </p>

39. (iii) SINCE GOD IS LOVE ITSELF AND WISDOM ITSELF, HE IS LIFE ITSELF, OR LIFE IN ITSELF. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
<p>We read in John:<p>The Word was with God, and the Word was God; in Him was Life, and the Life was the light of men, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p>'God' means there the Divine Love, and 'the Word' means the Divine Wisdom; and the Divine Wisdom is truly life, and life is truly the light radiated by the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God. The Divine Love gives shape to life, just as fire shapes light. Fire possesses two properties: that of burning and that of shining. Its burning radiates heat, its shining light. In the same way love has two properties: the one to which the burning of fire corresponds is something which acts intimately upon a person's will; the other, to which the shining corresponds, is something which acts intimately upon a person's understanding. This is the source of human love and intelligence. For as I have said several times before, the sun of the spiritual world radiates heat which in its essence is love, and light which in its essence is wisdom. These two forms of radiation impinge on every single thing in the universe and affect them intimately. In the case of people they affect their will and their understanding, which were created to receive this radiation, the will to receive love and the understanding to receive wisdom. Hence it is clear that a person's life resides in his understanding and is in accordance with his wisdom, and that the love of the will modifies it.<p>

39. (3) Because God is Love itself and Wisdom itself He is Life itself, which is Life in itself. It is said in John: <p>The Word was with God, and God was the Word. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>). <p>By "God" here the Divine love is meant, and by "the Word" the Divine wisdom; and strictly speaking "life" means the Divine wisdom, and the life strictly is the light that goes forth from the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which sun is Jehovah God. As fire forms light so does the Divine love form life. In fire there are two properties, burning and shining; from its burning property heat proceeds, and from its shining property, light. There are two like properties in love, one to which the burning property of fire corresponds, which is a something that inmostly affects the will of man, and another to which the shining property of fire corresponds, which is a something that inmostly affects the understanding of man. This is the source of man's love and intelligence; for, as repeatedly said before, from the sun of the spiritual world a heat goes forth that in its essence is love, and a light that in its essence is wisdom. These two flow into all things and each thing in the universe, and inmostly affect them, and with men these flow into their will and their understanding, for these two were created to be receptacles of influx-the will a receptacle of love, and the understanding a receptacle of wisdom. Thus it is manifest that the life of man dwells in his understanding, and is such as his wisdom is; and that it is modified by the love of the will. </p>

39. (3) GOD, BECAUSE HE IS LOVE ITSELF AND WISDOM ITSELF, IS LIFE ITSELF, WHICH IS LIFE IN ITSELF.<p>It is written in John:<p>"The Word was with God, and the Word was God... In Him was life; and the life was the light of men" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>.<p>By God is there signified the Divine Love, and by the Word the Divine Wisdom. The Divine Wisdom is essentially life, and life is essentially the light which proceeds from the Sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God. Divine Love forms life, as fire forms light. There are two properties in fire, burning and brilliance; from its burning proceeds heat and from its brilliance light. Similarly there are two properties in love, one to which the burning of fire corresponds, and which in a certain way intimately affects the will of man, and the other to which the brilliance of fire corresponds, and which similarly affects his understanding. From these two properties man derives his love and his intelligence; for as has been said several times before, there proceeds from the Sun of the spiritual world heat, which in its essence is love, and Light, which in its essence is wisdom. These two flow into everything in the universe and intimately affect them; and in the case of men, they flow into the will and the understanding, for these two are created to be the receptacles of influx, the will to be the receptacle of love, and the understanding to be the receptacle of wisdom. It is therefore evident that a man's life dwells in his understanding, that its quality depends upon his wisdom, and that it is modified by the love of his will. </p>

39. III. QUOD DEUS, QUIA EST IPSE AMOR ET IPSA SAPIENTIA, SIT IPSA VITA, QUAE EST VITA IN SE. Dicitur apud Johannem, "Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum, in Ipso Vita erat, et Vita erat Lux hominum," <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>; per Deum ibi intelligitur Divinus Amor, et per Verbum Divina Sapientia; ac Divina Sapientia proprie est Vita, ac Vita proprie est Lux, quae procedit a Sole Mundi spiritualis, in cujus medio est Jehovah Deus: Divinus Amor format Vitam, sicut ignis format lucem: in Igne sunt duo, Causticitas et Splendor, ex causticitate ejus procedit calor, et ex splendore ejus procedit lux; similiter in Amore sunt duo, unum cui causticitas ignis correspondet, et est quoddam intime afficiens voluntatem hominis, et alterum, cui splendor ignis correspondet, et est quoddam intime afficiens intellectum hominis; inde est homini amor et intelligentia; nam, ut supra aliquoties dictum est, ex Sole Mundi spiritualis procedit Calor, qui in essentia sua est amor, et Lux quae in essentia sua est sapientia; illa duo influunt in omnia et singula Universi, et illa intime afficiunt, et apud homines in eorum voluntatem et intellectum, quae duo creata sunt receptacula influxus, voluntas receptaculum amoris, ac intellectus receptaculum sapientiae: inde patet, quod vita hominis habitet in Intellectu, et quod talis sit, qualis est sapientia ejus, et quod amor voluntatis modificet illam. </p>
