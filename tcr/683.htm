683. What is a name without the thing it stands for? It is pointless. It is the sound of an echo that bounces off the trees in the forest or off vaulted ceilings. It is the vague murmur people make sometimes when they are dreaming. It is the sound of the wind, the sea, or machines, which have nothing useful to say.
<p>Would it be anything but a pointless exercise to be given the title of monarch, commander, mayor, bishop, abbot, or monk but not the position that goes with the title?
<p>Our having the name of being Christian but living like a barbarian and breaking the commandments of Christ is like gazing at the sign of Satan instead of the sign of Christ, even though at our baptism Christ's name was woven into us with golden threads.
</p>
<p>
[2] Surely, people who receive the identifying mark of Christ but then laugh at the thought of worshiping him, snarl at every mention of his name, and declare him to be the son of Joseph rather than the Son of God are rebels and assassins of the king. Their words are blasphemies against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven in this age or in the age to come [<a href="3927/matthew_12_32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>]. Like dogs, they bite the Word with their jaws and tear it to pieces with their teeth. For those who are against Christ and against worshiping him, "All the tables are full of the vomit they cast forth" (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_8.htm">Isaiah 28:8</a>).
<p>Yet the Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of God the Highest (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>), the only begotten (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>), the true God and eternal life (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); all the fullness of divinity dwells physically in him (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). He is not the son of Joseph (<a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>). Not to mention thousands of other passages. </p>

683. What is a name without something to refer to, but a useless sound, and a mere noise such as that thrown back from trees in a wood or from ceilings, what is called an echo? Or like the more or less meaningless <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
sounds made by dreamers, or like the sound of the wind, the sea or a machine, which serve no purpose. Indeed, what is the name of king, duke, consul, bishop, abbot or monk without the office the name belongs to but vanity? So what is it to bear the name of Christian, and yet to live like a barbarian and contrary to Christ's commandments, but as it were to contemplate the sign of Satan in place of the sign of Christ; yet His name is woven into baptism with golden threads?</p>
<p>
[2] What are those who after receiving the seal of Christ then laugh at His worship, snarl at His name, and claim that He is not the Son of God, only the son of Joseph, but rebels and regicides? What are their utterances but blasphemies against the Holy Spirit, blasphemies which cannot be forgiven, neither in this age nor in that to come? These people are like dogs agape to bite the Word and tear it to pieces with their teeth. In their case, confronted with Christ and His worship,<p>All the tables are full of vomited matter, <a href="3927/isaiah_28_8.htm">Isaiah 28:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>.<p>Yet the Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of the Most High God (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>); the only-begotten (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>); the true God and everlasting life (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>); and He was not the son of Joseph (<a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>), not to mention thousands of other passages.<p>

683. What is a name without the reality but an empty thing, or a sound like the echo given back by the trees of a forest or by vaulted buildings, or like the almost lifeless voice of dreamers, the noise of the wind, of the sea, or of some useless machinery? What but emptiness is the name even of a king, a duke, a consul, a bishop, an abbot, or a monk, without the office attached to the name? So what is the name Christian so long as the man lives like a barbarian, and contrary to the precepts of Christ, but like looking to the sign of Satan instead of the sign of Christ, although in baptism Christ's name is interwoven in golden threads? What but rebels and regicides are those who having received the sign of Christ, deride His worship, mock at His name, and acknowledge Him not as the Son of God but of Joseph? And what are their words but blasphemies against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven either in this world or in the next? These like dogs with open jaws bite at the Word, and tear it to pieces with their teeth. With such, as against Christ and the worship of Christ: <p>All tables are full of the vomit of filthiness (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_8.htm">Isaiah 28:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>). <p>And yet the Lord Jesus Christ is, <p>The Son of the Most High (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>); <p>The only begotten (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>); <p>The true God and eternal life (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); <p>In whom dwelleth all the fullness of Divinity bodily (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>); <p>And is not the son of Joseph (<a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>).

683. A name without the reality is but an empty void, like the echo which rebounds from the trees in a wood, or from vaulted roofs; or like the almost lifeless utterances of dreamers, or like the sound of the wind, or of the sea, or of a machine, which has nothing of use in it. Indeed, the name of king, duke, consul, bishop, abbot or monk, without the function attached to it, is nothing but empty sound. So, professing the name of Christian, when yet the man lives like a barbarian, and contrary to the precepts of Christ, is like looking to the standard of satan instead of the standard of Christ, although His name was woven into it with threads of gold at Baptism. Those who, after receiving the sign-manual of Christ, deride His worship, mock at His name, and profess that He is not the Son of God, but the son of Joseph, are nothing but rebels and regicides; and their words are nothing but blasphemies against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven either in this world or in the next. They are like dogs with open jaws, biting at the Word and tearing it to pieces with their teeth. These by their opposition to Christ and His worship have:<p>"all tables full of vomit and filthiness" <a href="3927/isaiah_28_8.htm">Isaiah 28:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>, when yet the Lord Jesus Christ is The Son of the Most High God, <a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>;<p>"The only begotten," <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">3:18</a>;<p>"The true God and eternal life" <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>;<p>"In whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>;<p>and not the son of Joseph, <a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>; besides thousands of other passages. </p>
