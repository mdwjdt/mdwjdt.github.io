<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>372</b>.⑷这种相互结合是藉着仁与信实现的。如今人们都知道，教会构成基督的身体，教会在每个个体里面，个体就在这个身体的某个部位中，如保罗所说（<a href="http://39-27.cn/弗1.23.htm">以弗所书1:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/林前12.27.htm">哥林多前书12:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗12.4.htm">罗马书12:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗12.5.htm">5</a>）。基督的身体不就是圣善（神性良善）与圣真（神性真理）吗？这就是主在约翰福音中所说这句话的意思：<br />吃我肉、喝我血的人常在我里面，我也常在他里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.56.htm">约翰福音6:56</a>）<br />主的肉表示圣善，饼也是；祂的血表圣真，酒也是；关于这些意义，详见圣餐那一章（698－752）。<br />由此可见，人越是拥有构成仁的各种良善和构成信的真理，就越在主里面，主也在他里面。因为与主的结合是属灵的结合，这种结合唯独通过仁和信产生。在圣经那一章（248－253）已说明，圣言的一切细节都包含主与教会、因而良善与真理的结合；因为仁是良善，信是真理，所以圣言处处都有仁与信的结合。综上所述，可推知：主是人里面的仁与信，人是主里面的仁与信。因为主是在人属世的仁与信里面的属灵的仁与信，人是出于主属灵的仁与信的属世的仁与信。这二者一旦结合，就会产生属灵－属世的仁与信。</p>

<p>
372. (4)如此相互的聯合是憑藉義與信產生的。
<p>現今的人們知道, 教會構成基督的身體。還知道有教會在裡面的每個成員都是這個身體的一部分, 正如保羅在<a href="3927/ephesians_1_23.htm">以弗所書1:23</a>,<a href="3927/1-corinthians_12_27.htm">哥林多前書12:27</a>,<a href="3927/romans_12_4.htm">羅馬書12:4-5</a>節所說。除了聖善(神性良善)與聖理(神性真理), 基督的身體還會是什麼呢？這就是主在『約翰福音』中所說之意:吃我肉喝我血的人,常在我裡面,我也常在他裡面(<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">約翰福音6:56</a>)。
<p>主的肉表示聖仁, 餅也是此意; 祂的血表示聖理, 酒也是此意。關於這些, 詳見聖餐一章(<a href="702.htm">702-709</a>)。
<p>[2]由此可見, 人若是專注於良善與真理(善與理構成義與信), 他就越在主裡面, 主越在他裡面。因為與主的聯合是屬靈的聯合, 唯有通過義與信才能產生。
<p>在關於聖言一章(<a href="248.htm">248-253</a>)中曾說明, 聖言的一切細節都包含著主與教會,因而良善與真理之間的聯合。因為義是良善, 信是真理, 因而遍及聖言都包含著義與信之間的聯合。
<p>由這些論點, 可得出:主是人裡面的義與信, 人是主裡面的義與信。因為主是屬靈的義與信,在人的屬世之義與信之中; 人是屬世的義與信,來自於主的屬靈之義與信。當兩種類型的義與信形成聯合時, 便成為屬靈之屬世(spiritual-and-earthly)的義與信。 </p>

372. (d) This reciprocal partnership between the Lord and us comes about through goodwill and faith. Today people know that the church constitutes the body of Christ. People also know that everyone who has the church inside is in some part of that body, as Paul says (<a href="3927/ephesians_1_23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="3927/1-corinthians_12_27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>; <a href="3927/romans_12_4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>). Is the body of Christ anything except divine goodness and divine truth? This is what the Lord's words in John mean: "Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me and I in them" (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>). "The Lord's flesh" means divine goodness, as does "bread. " "The Lord's blood" means divine truth, as does "wine. " Below in the chapter on the Holy Supper you will see that these are their true meanings [702-709].
<p>It follows that the more involved we are in acts of goodwill and in truths that relate to faith, the more we are in the Lord and the Lord is in us. Our partnership with the Lord is a spiritual partnership, and spiritual partnerships take place only through goodwill and faith.
<p>I have shown in the chapter on Sacred Scripture that a partnership between the Lord and the church and thus a partnership between goodness and truth exists in every detail of the Word, 248-253. Because goodwill is goodness and faith is truth, there is also a partnership between goodwill and faith throughout the Word.
<p>From all this it now follows that the Lord is goodwill and faith within us, and we are goodwill and faith within the Lord. The Lord is spiritual goodwill and faith in our earthly goodwill and faith; and we are earthly goodwill and faith from the Lord's spiritual goodwill and faith. As the two types of goodwill and faith forge a partnership, they become a goodwill and a faith that are spiritual-and-earthly. </p>

372. (iv) This reciprocal link between the Lord and man is created by means of charity and faith.<p>It is known at the present time that the church constitutes the body of Christ, and that each individual, in whom the church is, is in some member of that body, as Paul says (<a href="3927/ephesians_1_23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="3927/1-corinthians_12_27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>; <a href="3927/romans_12_4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>). But what is the body of Christ but Divine good and Divine truth? This is what is meant by the Lord's words in John:<p>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him, <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>.<p>The Lord's flesh means Divine good, as bread does too; His blood means Divine truth, as wine does too; for these meanings, see the chapter on the Holy Supper [<a href="698.htm">698-752</a>]. </p>
<p>
[2] It follows from this that in so far as a person is in possession of the kinds of good which make up charity and the truths which make up faith, so far is he in the Lord and the Lord is in him. For linking with the Lord is spiritual linking, and this takes place solely through charity and faith. It was shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture (<a href="248.htm">248-253</a>) that every detail of the Word contains a linking of the Lord and the church, and so of good and truth; and because charity is good and faith is truth, there is at every point in the Word a linking of charity and faith. From these propositions it now follows that the Lord is charity and faith in a person, and a person is charity and faith in the Lord. For the Lord is the spiritual charity and faith in a person's natural charity and faith, and a person is the natural charity and faith coming from the Lord's spiritual charity and faith. These when linked constitute spiritual-natural charity and faith. </p>

372. (4) This reciprocal conjunction of the Lord and man is effected by means of charity and faith. It is known at the present day that the church constitutes the body of Christ, and that everyone in whom the church is, is in some member of that body, according to Paul (<a href="3927/ephesians_1_23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="3927/1-corinthians_12_27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>; <a href="3927/romans_12_4.htm">Romans 12:4, 5</a>). But what is the body of Christ but Divine good and Divine truth? This is meant by the Lord's words in John: <p>Be that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood abideth in Me and I in him (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">6:56</a>). <p>By the Lord's "flesh" and by "bread" the Divine good is meant, and by His "blood" and "wine" Divine truth is meant, as will be seen in the chapter on the Holy Supper. From this it follows, that so far as man is in the goods of charity and the truths of faith, so far he is in the Lord and the Lord in him; for conjunction with the Lord is spiritual conjunction, and spiritual conjunction is effected solely by means of charity and faith. That there is a conjunction of the Lord and the church, and consequently of good and truth, in each and all things of the Word, has been shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture (n. <a href="248.htm">248-253</a>); and since charity is good and faith is truth, there is everywhere in the Word a conjunction of charity and faith. From the foregoing it now follows, that the Lord is charity and faith in man, and that man is charity and faith in the Lord; for the Lord is spiritual charity and faith in man's natural charity and faith, and man is natural charity and faith from the Lord's spiritual charity and faith, and these two conjoined produce a spiritual-natural charity and faith. </p>

372. (4) This reciprocal conjunction of the Lord and man is effected by means of charity and faith. It is general knowledge to-day that the Church constitutes the body of Christ, and that every one in whom the Church is present is in some member of that body, according to what is said by Paul,<p><a href="3927/ephesians_1_23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="3927/1-corinthians_12_27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>; <a href="3927/romans_12_4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>.<p>Now what is the body of Christ but Divine Good and Divine Truth? This is meant by the Lord's words in John,<p>"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him" <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>.<p>The Lord's flesh, and also bread, mean Divine Good; and His blood, and also wine, mean Divine Truth. That this is their meaning will be seen in the chapter on the Holy Supper. It therefore follows that so far as a man is in the good of charity and in the truth of faith, he is in the Lord, and the Lord is in him; for conjunction with the Lord is spiritual, and spiritual conjunction is effected only by means of charity and faith. That there is a conjunction of the Lord and the Church, and consequently of good and truth, throughout the whole of the Word in all its details, was shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, <a href="248.htm">248-253</a>; and because charity is good, and faith is truth, there is in every part of the Word a conjunction of charity and faith. From what has been said it now follows that the Lord is charity and faith in man, and that man is charity and faith in the Lord. For the Lord is spiritual charity and faith in man's natural charity and faith, and man is natural charity and faith from the spiritual of the Lord; and these, when united, produce charity and faith, which are spiritual natural. </p>
