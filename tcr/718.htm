718. All who are of sound mind have an endless capacity for receiving wisdom from the Lord, that is, for increasing the number of truths that constitute their wisdom. They also have a similarly endless capacity for receiving love, that is, of bearing more fruit in the form of good feelings and actions that constitute their love. This perpetual bearing of more good fruit and therefore of love, and this perpetual increase of truths and therefore of wisdom, is something that is experienced by angels, and also by people who are becoming angels.
<p>The Lord is love itself and wisdom itself; therefore we are endowed with an endless capacity for uniting ourselves to the Lord and the Lord to ourselves. Nevertheless, because we are finite, his actual divinity cannot become an integral part of us; it can only make contact with us and affect us. For an example by way of illustration, the light of the sun cannot become part of the substance of our eye, and a sound in the air cannot become part of the substance of our ear. The light and sound can only impinge on our eyes and ears and give us the ability to see and hear. We are not life itself the way the Lord was, even in his humanity (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>); we are vessels for receiving life. Life itself cannot become an integral part of us, but it can have contact with us and affect us. I have added these points to help you understand in exactly what way the Lord and his redemption are fully present in the Holy Supper. </p>

718. Every sane person has the capability of receiving wisdom from the Lord, that is, of increasing for ever the number of truths of which wisdom is composed. He has also the capability of receiving love, that is, of making the various kinds of good, of which love is composed, bear fruit, likewise for ever. This perpetual fruiting of good and so of love, and this perpetual increase of truth and so of wisdom is granted to the angels, and also to people who become angels. Because the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself, it follows that man has the capability of linking himself to the Lord, and of having the Lord linked to him, perpetually. Yet because man is finite, the Lord's actual Divine cannot be linked to him, but only attached. To use an illustration, the light of the sun cannot be linked to the eye, nor can the sound carried by the air be linked to the ear, but it can only be attached, so as to make them capable of seeing and hearing. For man is not life in himself, as the Lord is, even as regards the Human (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>), but is a receiver of life; and the Lord is life itself, which cannot be linked, but only attached. These remarks have been added to enable it to be understood how the Lord and His redemption are wholly present in the Holy Supper. </p>

718. In every man of sound mind there is an ability to receive wisdom from the Lord, that is, to multiply to eternity the truths from which wisdom exists; also an ability to receive love, that is, to bring forth to eternity the goods from which love exists. This perpetual bringing forth of good and of love therefrom, and perpetual multiplication of truth and of wisdom therefrom, is granted to the angels, and also to men who are becoming angels; and as the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself, it follows that man has the ability to conjoin himself to the Lord and the Lord to himself forever. Nevertheless, as man is finite, the Divine Itself of the Lord cannot be conjoined, but only adjoined to man, as, for the sake of illustration, the light of the sun cannot be conjoined to the eye, or the sound of the air to the ear, but only adjoined to them, thus imparting the ability to see and hear. For man is not life in himself, as the Lord is even in regard to His Human (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>); but is only a receptacle of life; and it is life itself that is adjoined to man, but not conjoined. This has been added in order that it may be rationally understood how the Lord and His redemption are wholly present in the holy supper. </p>

718. Every man of sound mind has the faculty of receiving wisdom from the Lord; that is, of acquiring to eternity the many truths from which wisdom is formed. He has the faculty also of receiving love; that is, of bearing, likewise to eternity, good fruits from which love is formed. This perpetual increase of good, and thence of love, and also of truth, and thence of wisdom, is granted to the angels, and also to men who become angels; and as the Lord is Love itself and Wisdom itself, it follows that man has the capacity of conjoining himself with the Lord, and the Lord with himself, for ever. Nevertheless, as man is finite, the Lord's Divine itself cannot be conjoined with him, but only adjoined; as, for example, it is impossible for the light waves of the sun to be conjoined with the eye, and for the sound waves of the air to be conjoined with the ear; these can only be adjoined, and in this way seeing and hearing are possible. Man is not life in himself, as the Lord is even to the Human, <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>; but man is a receptacle of life, and life itself is only adjoined to man, not conjoined with him. These observations have been added that the reader may understand how the Lord, and the whole of His redemption, is wholly present in the Holy Supper. </p>

718. Apud unumquemque hominem sanum, est facultas recipiendi sapientiam a Domino, hoc est, multiplicandi Vera, a quibus sit illa, in aeternum; et quoque recipiendi amorem, hoc est, fructificandi bona, ex quibus est ille, similiter in aeternum: perpetua haec fructificatio boni et inde amoris, et perpetua illa multiplicatio veri et inde sapientiae, datur apud Angelos, et quoque datur apud homines, qui fiunt Angeli: et quia Dominus est ipse Amor et ipsa Sapientia, consequitur quod homini sit facultas conjungendi se Domino, et Dominum sibi in perpetuum; sed usque quia homo finitus est, non potest ei conjungi Ipsum Divinum Ejus, sed solum adjungi; sicut, pro illustratione, non potest Lux solis conjungi Oculo, nec Sonus aeris conjungi Auri, sed modo eis adjungi, et sic dare facultatem videndi et audiendi; homo enim non est Vita in se, sicut Dominus etiam quoad Humanum, <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">Johannes 5:26</a>, sed est receptaculum vitae, et ipsa Vita est, quae homini adjungitur, sed non conjungitur. Haec addita sunt, propter finem, ut intelligatur qua ratione totus Dominus et tota Ipsius Redemptio in Sancta Coena adest. </p>
