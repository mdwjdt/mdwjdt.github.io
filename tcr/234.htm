<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第6节 圣言的字义产生与主的结合，以及与天使的联结</h4><br />234.圣言产生与主的结合，是因为祂就是圣言，也就是说，是神圣真理本身和其中的神圣良善本身。该结合是由字义产生的，因为字义上的圣言就在它的完全、神圣和能力中，如前所述（214－224节）。该结合并未向人显明，而是存在于对真理的情感和对真理的感知中。字义产生与天堂天使的联结，是因为字义里面有一个属灵之义和一个属天之义。这些就是天使所拥有的意义；主的属灵国度的天使拥有圣言的属灵之义，主的属天国度的天使则拥有圣言的属天之义。当视圣言为神圣的人阅读圣言时，这两层意义就通过圣言的属世之义被解开。这种解开是一瞬间的事，联结也因此瞬间产生。</p>

234. 聖言的文字意義產生了與主的連接以及與天人的聯合
<p>聖言產生了與主的連接, 因為祂就是聖言, 也就是說, 聖理之本和聖善之本包含在聖言之中。這樣的連接是由文字意義製造出的, 因為在這層意義中, 聖言在其完全,神聖和能力之中(如之彰前<a href="214.htm">214-224</a>節所述)。這連接並不為人所見, 而是存於對真理以及對感知真理的喜愛之情當中。聖言的文字意義還產生了與天國之天人的聯合, 原因在於屬靈與屬天的意義包括在其中, 這些是天人們所掌握的意義。主的屬靈國度的天人掌握聖言的屬靈意義, 祂屬天國度的天人們掌握聖言的屬天意義。當尊聖言為聖之人讀經時, 這兩種意義會從聖言中解開。這樣的解開會瞬間產生, 於是聯合也如此產生。 </p>

234. 6. The Word's Literal Meaning Provides a Connection to the Lord and Association with Angels
<p>The Word provides a connection to the Lord because he is the Word; that is, he is the divine truth and the divine goodness within it. The literal meaning provides this connection because in this meaning the Word has its completeness, holiness, and power, as I have shown in the relevant passage above [214-224]. The connection to the Lord is not apparent to us; it exists in our love for the truth and our perception of it.
<p>The Word's literal meaning also provides association with angels in heaven because within the literal meaning there is a spiritual meaning and a heavenly meaning. The angels are in these higher meanings. Angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom are in the Word's spiritual meaning, and angels of the Lord's heavenly kingdom are in the Word's heavenly meaning. These two meanings unfold out of the Word's earthly meaning when the Word is read by people who regard it as holy. The unfolding is instantaneous and the association forms immediately. </p>

234. VI. The literal sense of the Word produces a link with the Lord and association with the angels.<p>The Word produces a link with the Lord, because He is the Word, that is, Divine truth itself and Divine good itself contained in it. The link is produced by the literal sense, because in that sense the Word is in its fulness, holiness and power, as was shown above in the section on this subject [<a href="214.htm">214-224</a>]. That link is not visible to man, but lies in the affection for truth and the perception of truth. The reason why the literal sense produces association with the angels in heaven is that the spiritual and celestial senses are contained in it, and these are the senses the angels possess; the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom possess the spiritual sense of the Word, those of His celestial kingdom its celestial sense. These two senses are unwound from the Word, when a person who regards it as holy reads it. The unwinding takes place instantly, and so therefore does the association. </p>

234. VI. BY MEANS OF THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD THERE IS CONJUNCTION WITH THE LORD AND AFFILIATION WITH THE ANGELS. <p>There is conjunction with the Lord by means of the Word because He is the Word, that is, the essential Divine truth and good therein. This conjunction is effected by means of the sense of the letter, because the Word in that sense is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power (as has been shown above in its own section). This conjunction is not apparent to man, but it exists in affection for truth and in the perception of truth. There is affiliation with the angels of heaven by means of the sense of the letter, because within that sense there is a spiritual and a celestial sense; and the angels are in these senses, the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the spiritual sense of the Word, and the angels of His celestial kingdom in its celestial sense. These two senses are evolved from the natural sense of the Word when it is read by a man who regards the Word as holy. The evolution is instantaneous; consequently the affiliation is also. </p>

Conjunction is effected by the sense of the Letter because the Word in that sense is in its fulness, its sanctity, and its power, as was shown above in the article upon it.

<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;hi bini Sensus evolvuntur. This unfolding is instantaneous, Evolutio est instantanea. The root idea of evolution in English is the development of a lower to a higher form, the higher retaining the essential features of the lower. The senses of the Word are discrete degrees: the celestial and the spiritual are not developments of the natural. The celestial and the spiritual are the end and the cause, the natural being the effect. The cause and the end cannot by any development be produced from the effect, and so cannot be said to evolve from the effect. Thus while evolvo and evolutio are used in this Number, it does not follow that the directly derived English words, evolve and evolution, are the best terms to translate them. "Unfold" and "unfolding" would appear to express what happens when a man who regards the Word as holy reads it. The inner senses are not developments of the natural sense: they are unfolded as inner contents in an outer vessel, the vessel never developing into, that is, becoming its contents. </p>

234. VI.<p>Quod per Sensum literae Verbi sit conjunctio cum Domino, et consociatio cum Angelis.<p>VI. Quod per Verbum sit conjunctio cum Domino, est quia Ipse est Verbum, hoc est, ipsum Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum inibi: quod per Sensum literae sit conjunctio, est quia Verbum in illo Sensu est in suo pleno, in suo sancto, et in sua potentia, ut supra in suo Articulo ostensum est: Conjunctio illa non apparet homini, sed est in affectione veri, et in perceptione ejus. Quod per Sensum literae sit consociatio cum Angelis coeli, est quia illi Sensui inest Sensus spiritualis et Sensus coelestis: et in his Sensibus sunt Angeli, Angeli Regni Spiritualis Domini in Sensu spirituali Verbi, et Angeli Regni coelestis Ipsius in Sensu coelesti ejus; hi bini Sensus evolvuntur ex Sensu naturali Verbi, dum homo, qui sanctum habet Verbum, legit illud. Evolutio est instantanea, proinde etiam consociatio. </p>
