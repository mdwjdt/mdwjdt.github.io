652. From the Lord's own words, we can see that he ascribes goodness to everyone and evil to no one, and therefore that he judges no one to hell but instead lifts us all toward heaven to the degree that we will follow along.
<p>Jesus said, "When I am raised up from the earth I will draw all people to myself. " (<a href="3927/john_12_32.htm">John 12:32</a>)
<p>God did not send his Son into the world in order to judge the world, but so that the world would be saved through him. Those who believe in him are not judged; but those who do not believe have already been judged. (<a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>)
<p>If any hear my words but do not believe, I do not judge them. I have not come to judge the world but to save the world. Those who reject me and do not accept my words have something that judges them: the Word that I have spoken. This will judge them on the last day. (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "I judge no one. " (<a href="3927/john_8_15.htm">John 8:15</a>)
<p>Here and elsewhere in the Word "judgment" means judgment to hell, which is damnation. Judgment is not mentioned in connection with salvation; instead the term "resurrection of life" is used (<a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">John 5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">3:18</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] The "Word" that will judge us means the truth, and the truth is that all evil comes from hell, and evil and hell are one. When evil individuals are lifted by the Lord toward heaven, their evil drags them downward; and because they love that evil they follow it of their own accord. Another truth in the Word is that goodness is heaven. Therefore when good people are lifted by the Lord toward heaven, they go up seemingly of their own accord and are brought in. The latter people are said to be written in the book of life (<a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] In actual fact there is a kind of field that constantly emanates from the Lord, which pulls all toward heaven. It fills the entire spiritual world and the entire physical world. It is like a strong current in the ocean that secretly carries ships along. All people who believe in the Lord and live by his commandments come into that field or current and are lifted up. Those who do not believe, though, are not willing to enter it. They move themselves to the sides and are there caught in a flow that leads down into hell. </p>

<p>
652. The Lord imputes good to everyone and evil to none, and consequently His judgment sends no one to hell, but raises all to heaven in so far as a person follows. This is established by His own words:<p>Jesus said, When I am raised up from the earth, I shall draw all to myself, <a href="3927/john_12_32.htm">John 12:32</a>.<p>God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world should be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged, but he who does not believe is already judged, <a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>.<p>If anyone has heard my words, yet has not believed, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. He who despises me and does not receive my words has that which judges him. The word which I have spoken will judge him on the last day, <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>.<p>Jesus said, I judge no one, <a href="3927/john_8_15.htm">John 8:15</a>.<p>Judgment here and elsewhere in the Word means being sent by judgment to hell, which is damnation. In speaking of salvation the term judgment is not used, but resurrection to life (<a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">John 5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">3:18</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] The word which will judge means truth; and it is a truth that all evil is from hell, and so evil and hell are one. When therefore the wicked person is raised by the Lord towards heaven, then his evil drags him down, and because he loves evil, he follows of his own accord. It is also a truth contained in the Word that good is heaven. When therefore the good person is raised by the Lord towards heaven, he climbs up as if of his own accord, and is brought inside. These are those who are said to be 'written in the Book of Life' (<a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a>).</p>
<p>
[3] There is in fact a sphere continuously radiated by the Lord, which raises all to heaven; this fills the whole of both the spiritual and natural worlds. It is like a strong current in the ocean, which invisibly draws a ship along. All who believe in the Lord and live in accordance with His commandments come within that sphere or current, and are raised up. But those who do not believe are unwilling to come within it, but take themselves off to one side or the other, and are there swept away by the stream bound for hell. </p>

<p>
652. That the Lord imputes good to every man and evil to none, consequently that He does not condemn anyone to hell, but so far as man follows raises all to heaven, is evident from His words: <p>Jesus said, When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Myself (<a href="3927/john_12_32.htm">John 12:32</a>). <p>God sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not judged but he that believeth not hath been judged already (<a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17, 18</a>). <p>If any man hear My words and yet hath not believed, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him; the Word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47, 48</a>). <p>Jesus said, I judge no man (<a href="3927/john_8_15.htm">John 8:15</a>). <p>"Judgment" here and elsewhere in the Word means judgment to hell, which is condemnation; but of salvation judgment is not predicated, but resurrection to life (<a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">John 5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">3:18</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] "The Word" which is to judge means the truth; and the truth is that all evil is from hell, and thus that they are one. So when a wicked man is raised up by the Lord toward heaven, his evil draws him down; and because he loves evil, he himself freely follows it. It is also a truth in the Word that good is heaven; so when a good man is raised by the Lord toward heaven, he ascends as it were freely, and is introduced. Such are said, <p>To be written in the book of life (<a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_26.htm">21:26</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] There is actually a sphere proceeding continually from the Lord and filling the entire spiritual and natural worlds which raises all towards heaven. It is like a strong current in the ocean which unobservedly draws a vessel. All who believe in the Lord and live according to His precepts enter that sphere or current and are elevated; while those who do not believe, are unwilling to enter, but withdraw themselves to the sides, and are there carried away by a current that sets toward hell. </p>

652. The Lord imputes good to every man, and evil to no one; and consequently He condemns no one to hell, but raises all, so far as they follow Him, to heaven. This is evident from His own words:<p>Jesus said, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me" <a href="3927/john_12_32.htm">John 12:32</a>.<p>"God sent not His Son into the world to judge (A.V., condemn) the world; but that the world through Him might be saved.

He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day" <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>.<p>Jesus said, "I judge no man" <a href="3927/john_8_15.htm">John 8:15</a>.<p>Judgment, in these and other passages in the Word, means judgment to hell, which is condemnation; of salvation, however, judgment is not predicated, but resurrection to life, <a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">John 5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">3:18</a>.</p>

It is like a strong current in the ocean, which with hidden force bears a ship along.

652. Quod Dominus omni homini imputet bonum, et non alicui malum, consequenter quod non judicet aliquem ad Infernum, sed omnes, quantum homo sequitur, elevet ad Coelum, constat ex his Ipsius verbis, Jesus dixit, dum exaltatus sum e terra, omnes traham ad Meipsum, <a href="3927/john_12_32.htm">Johannes 12:32</a>. Non misit Deus Filium suum in Mundum ut judicet Mundum, sed ut salvetur Mundus per Ipsum; qui credit in Ipsum non judicatur; qui autem non credit jam judicatus est, <a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">Johannes 3:17-18</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Si quis mea verba audiverit, et tamen non crediderit, Ego non judico illum, non enim veni ut judicem Mundum, sed ut salvem Mundum; qui spernit Me, et non accipit mea verba, habet quod judicet illum, Verbum quod loquutus sum, judicabit illum in extremo die, <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">Johannes 12:47-48</a>. Jesus dixit, Ego judico neminem, <a href="3927/john_8_15.htm">Johannes 8:15</a>, per Judicium hic et alibi in Verbo, intelligitur judicium ad Infernum, quod est damnatio, at de Salvatione non praedicatur judicium, sed resurrectio ad vitam, <a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">Johannes 5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">3:18</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] per Verbum quod judicabit, intelligitur Veritas, ac veritas est, quod omne malum sit ab Inferno, et sic quod unum sint, quare dum malus elevatur a Domino versus Coelum, tunc malum ejus detrahit illum, et quia amat malum, sequitur ipse sua sponte: est quoque veritas in Verbo, quod Bonum sit Coelum, quare dum Bonus a Domino elevatur versus Coelum, ascendit ille sicut sponte sua, ac introducitur; hi dicuntur scripti in Libro vitae, <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Apocalypsis 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
