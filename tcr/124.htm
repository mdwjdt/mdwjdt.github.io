<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第124节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>124</b>. （5）这种救赎只能通过神道成肉身来成就。前一节说明，救赎纯粹是神性行为，因而唯有全能的神才能成就。救赎只能通过祂道成肉身，也就是使自己成为人来成就。原因在于，耶和华神在祂的无限本质中是无法靠近地狱的，更不用说进入地狱，因为祂存在于最纯和最初之物中。因此，在其本质属性中的耶和华哪怕稍微将气息吹到地狱里的人身上，就会即刻毁灭他们。当摩西想要见祂时，祂对摩西说：<br />你不能看见我的面，因为人见我的面不能存活（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.20.htm">出埃及记33:20</a>）<br />就连摩西都不能见祂，何况那些地狱里的人，地狱的一切都存在于最末和最粗鄙之物中，因而是最远的。他们就是最低的属世层。因此缘故，若非耶和华神取了人的样式，从而披上属于最低层之物的肉体，祂的任何救赎都是徒劳。若不靠近敌人，或为了战斗而全副武装，谁能攻打敌人？若不披盔戴甲，手持长矛，谁能驱散和消灭龙、九头蛇和沙漠蜥蜴？没有船只和捕捞装备，谁能捕获大海里的鲸鱼？这些以及类似的事尽管不十分恰当，但也能说明全能的神与地狱的争战，主若不先取了人的样式，就无法进入地狱。<br />必须知道，主与地狱的争战不是口头上的论战，象推理者和争论者那样。这样的战斗对地狱没有任何作用。它是一场属灵的争战，神圣真理以神圣良善的力量，也就是主的生命力量而作战。若神圣真理以可见的方式流入，地狱中无人能抵挡。其中所蕴含的力量，使得地狱魔鬼一觉察到它就立刻逃之夭夭，投入深渊，爬进洞穴藏起来。这和以赛亚书描述得一样：<br />他们就进入石洞，进入土穴，躲避耶和华的惊吓和祂威严的荣光。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.19.htm">以赛亚书2:19</a>）<br />启示录：<br />他们都藏在山洞和岩石穴里，向山和岩石说，倒在我们身上吧，把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目和羔羊的忿怒。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.15.htm">启示录6:15</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.16.htm">16</a>）<br />当主于1757年执行最后审判时，祂通过神圣良善拥有这种力量，这一点从《最后的审判》这本小册子所描述的事可以看出来。如：在灵人界，主将地狱恶灵盘踞的大山小山夷为平地，驱散他们，其中一些沉下去。祂还淹没他们的城镇、村庄和田地，彻底掀翻整个地面，把地和其上的居民全都扔进漩涡、沼泽和湿地，除此之外还有很多。所有这一切都是唯独主凭借出于神圣良善的神圣真理而实现的。</p>

<p>
124. (5)如果上帝沒有成為肉身, 這真實的救贖無法發生。
<p>在前一節, 我們闡述了救贖是完全神性的作為——惟有全能上帝來完成。另外, 除非上帝變成肉身(就是成為人), 否則連祂也無法完成這樣的救贖。因為在祂的無限本質之中, 耶和華無法接近地獄, 更無法進入。因為祂是首先,存在於至純之中, 因此當耶和華上帝處於這種狀態(在自己的本質之中), 恐怕只是呼氣在地獄之中, 他們就即刻被全然毀滅了。正如祂對摩西說的話, 那時摩西盼望見到上帝:"你不能見我的面, 因為沒有人見我的面還活著"(<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">出埃及記33:20</a>)。如果摩西尚不能做到, 那些在地獄之中的更加不能。因為那裡的靈處於最低的,最终端, 因而離上帝的距離最遠。屬世的, 是最底層的。因此, 如果耶和華上帝未曾自己取了人的樣式, 就是自已穿上肉體(從而處於最底層), 那麼祂試圖救贖的任何動作都是妄然。
<p>沒有武器裝備, 我們無法與敵軍作戰。若不披戴頭盔鎧甲, 手持長矛, 我們怎樣在荒野打敗並趕跑蛇怪和蜥怪？沒有船和捕撈裝備, 我們如何在海中捕鯨？這些情形與上帝同地獄之戰類似, 若不取了肉身, 上帝無法與地獄作戰。
<p>[2]不過, 有一點很重要:主與地獄間的戰鬥並非那些言語上的回合,像哲學辯論或法律答辨那樣, 這樣的戰鬥對地獄無任何影響。而是屬靈戰鬥, 利用聖善之力,由聖理出擊, 這是主真正的生命力量。當這些真理進入並顯現時, 地獄之中無一能擋。當魔鬼僅僅感覺到真理出現時, 就即刻落荒而逃, 投進深處, 並躲在地下, 以免被見。這情形就像以賽亞所言:"他們進入石洞, 進入土穴, 躲避耶和華的驚嚇和祂威嚴的榮光。"(<a href="3927/isaiah_2_19.htm">以賽亞書2:19</a>)。還有『啟示錄』:"他們都藏在洞窟和山上的磐石裡; 向山和磐石說∶'倒在我們身上吧, 把我們藏起來, 好躲避坐寶座者的面目和羔羊的義怒'(<a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">啟示錄6:15-16</a>), <p>[3]在執行1757年最後的審判中, 主由聖善發出的力量有多大的能力, 在『最後的審判』一書中有詳細描述。例如, 在靈界中, 有些大山和小丘被惡靈佔領盤踞, 主將他們驅趕, 並移動大山, 甚至有的夷為平地。祂淹沒他們的城鎮,村莊和郊野, 甚至顛翻他們整個土地,把地和上面居住的全都扔進深坑,湖泊和沼澤, 及其它地方。這全都是主獨自完成,藉著聖善而來的聖理之力。 </p>

124. 5. This true redemption could not have happened if God had not come in the flesh. The preceding point showed that redemption was something only the Divine could bring about - for anyone other than God Almighty it would have been impossible. Furthermore, God could not have brought about this redemption if he had not taken on flesh (that is, become human), because in his infinite essence Jehovah God could not come near hell, let alone enter it. He exists in what is first and most pure. If Jehovah God as he is in himself were only to breathe on those who are in hell he would instantly kill them all. When Moses wanted to see him he said, "You cannot see my faces, because no human being will see me and stay alive" (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). If Moses could not do this, still less could those who are in hell, where everyone exists in what is lowest, densest, and farthest away [from God]. Those who are earthly are the lowest. Therefore if Jehovah God had not taken on a human manifestation, clothing himself with a body that is on the lowest level, his undertaking any act of redemption would have been a waste of time.
<p>We could not attack an enemy without being armed for battle and coming within range. We could not destroy or drive away the dragons, hydras, and basilisks in some desert without putting a breastplate on our body, a helmet on our head, and a spear in our hand. We could not catch whales at sea without a ship and whaling equipment. These examples are not actual parallels, but they do illustrate the fact that God Almighty could not have even attempted to battle hell without first putting on a human manifestation.
</p>
<p>
[2] It is important to know, however, that the Lord's battle with the hells was not some verbal to and fro like a philosophical debate or a legal battle. That kind of battle has no effect whatever on hell. It was a spiritual battle using the divine truth connected with divine good - the very vitality of the Lord. When this truth visibly flows in, no one in the hells is able to oppose it. There is so much power in it that when demons from hell merely sense that it might be present they run away, throw themselves down into deep places, and squeeze into underground shelters to hide. This phenomenon is the same thing described by Isaiah: "They will go into caverns in the rocks and into crevices in the dust, dreading Jehovah, when he rises to terrify the earth" (<a href="3927/isaiah_2_19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>); and in the Book of Revelation: "They will all hide themselves in caves in the rocks and in the rocks on the mountains, and they will say to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb" (<a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] How much power the Lord exercised from divine goodness when he carried out the Last Judgment in 1757 is clear from the descriptions in the little work Last Judgment. For example, in the world of spirits there were mountains and hills occupied by hellish spirits that the Lord ripped from their moorings and moved far away; some he flattened. He flooded their cities, villages, and fields, and turned their land upside down. He threw those mountains and hills and their inhabitants into quagmires, ponds, and swamps; and more. The Lord alone accomplished all this using the power of divine truth connected with divine goodness. </p>

124. (v) THIS REDEMPTION COULD ONLY BE EFFECTED BY AN INCARNATE GOD.<p>The previous section showed that redemption was an entirely Divine deed, and consequently it could only have been accomplished by almighty God. The reason why it had to be by means of His incarnation, that is, by making Himself man, is that Jehovah God, as He is in His infinite essence, cannot approach hell, much less enter it, since He exists at the purest and first level. Therefore if Jehovah God, being in essence of that nature, were so much as to breathe upon those in hell, He would destroy them in an instant. For He said to Moses, when he desired to see God:<p>You cannot see my face, for no man shall see me and live, <a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>.<p>Since then Moses could not, far less can those in hell, where all are at the lowest, grossest and therefore most distant level, since they are the lowest of natural men. Therefore if Jehovah God had not taken upon Himself human form, and thus clothed Himself with a body at the lowest level, it would have been vain for Him to attempt any kind of redemption. For how can anyone attack an enemy, unless he comes to grips and equips himself with weapons to fight with? How can anyone drive off and destroy snakes, hydras and basilisks in some desert, unless he protects his body with armour and his head with a helmet, and takes a spear in his hand? Or how can anyone catch whales at sea, without a ship and equipment designed for the purpose? These and similar images are not so much a comparison as an illustration of almighty God's battle with the hells, which He could not have started without first taking human form.</p>
<p>
[2] But it needs to be known that the Lord's battle with the hells was not a battle of words, like people arguing a point or disputing in a court of law. That sort of battle is quite ineffectual here. It was a spiritual battle, Divine Truth fighting with the strength of Divine Good, that is, the very life force of the Lord. No one in the hells can stand its effects when made visible. Its power is such that at a mere glance the spirits of hell take to their heels, hurl themselves into the depths and force themselves underground to hide from it. This is the same as is described by Isaiah:<p>They shall go into caverns in the rocks and into cracks in the dust, for fear of Jehovah, when He arises to terrify the earth, <a href="3927/isaiah_2_19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>.<p>and in Revelation:<p>All shall hide themselves in caves in the rocks and in rocky mountains; and they shall say to the mountains and the rocks, Fall upon us and hide us from the face of Him that sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, <a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] What the Lord's strength that He has from Divine good was like when He was effecting the Last Judgement in 1757 can be proved by the descriptions given of that event in my small book on the subject. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
For example, it tore from their places hills and mountains in the world of spirits, which spirits from hell had seized, transferred them to different locations and made some sink into the ground; it flooded towns, villages and their surrounding land, completely upheaved their fields and cast them together with their inhabitants into chasms, lakes and marshes, and much besides. All this was accomplished by the Lord alone by the power of Divine truth coming from Divine good.<p>

124. (5) This redemption itself could not have been accomplished except by God incarnated. It has been shown in the preceding article that redemption was a work purely Divine, consequently that it could have been effected only by the omnipotent God. It could have been effected only by God incarnated, that is, made Man, because Jehovah God, as He is in His infinite essence, cannot come near to hell, much less enter into it; for He is in things purest and first. Therefore if Jehovah as He is in Himself were but to breathe upon those who are in hell He would instantly destroy them; for He said to Moses, when Moses wished to see Him: <p>Thou canst not see My face; for there shall no man see Me and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). <p>As Moses, then, could not see Him, still less could those who are in hell, where all are in things last and grossest, and thus most remote, for they are the lowest natural. For this reason, if Jehovah God had not assumed a Human, and thus clothed Himself with a body that belongs to things lowest, He would have undertaken in vain any redemption. For who can attack an enemy without approaching him, or without being armed for the battle? Or who can disperse and destroy the dragons, hydras, and basilisks in a desert, unless he covers his body with armor and his head with a helmet, and takes a spear in his hand? Or who can capture whales in the sea without a boat and implements adapted to the work? The combat of God Almighty against the hells, upon which He could not have entered unless He had first assumed a Human, may be illustrated by these and like things, though they afford no adequate comparison.
</p>
<p>
[2] But it must be understood that the Lord's combat against the hells was not an oral combat, like one between reasoners and disputants; such a combat would have no effect whatever there. It was a spiritual combat, which is that of Divine truth from Divine good. This truth was the Lord's very life, the influx of which through the medium of sight no one in the hells can resist. There is in it such power that the infernal genii flee away at the mere perception of it, cast themselves into the abyss, and creep into caves to hide themselves. This is what is described in Isaiah: <p>They shall enter into the caves of the rocks and into the clefts of the dust for fear of Jehovah when He shall arise to terrify the earth (<a href="3927/isaiah_2_19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>). <p>And in the Apocalypse: <p>All hid themselves in caves and in the rocks of the mountains; and they said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">6:15-17</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] The kind of power which the Lord possessed from Divine good when He executed the last judgment, in 1757, may be seen from the things described in the little work on that judgment; as that He tore up from their places the hills and mountains which the infernals occupied in the world of spirits, dispersed them, and caused some of them to sink. He also deluged their towns and houses and fields with a flood, rooted up their lands from their foundations, and hurled them with their inhabitants into whirlpools, swamps, and marshes; and much more; and all this was done by the Lord alone, by the power of Divine truth from Divine good. </p>

It could not have been accomplished but by God incarnate, that is, made Man, because Jehovah God, as He is in His infinite essence, cannot approach hell, much less enter into it, for He is in purest and first things. Therefore, if Jehovah God being such in Himself were but to breathe upon those who are in hell, He would instantly destroy them; for He said to Moses, who desired to see Him:<p>"Thou canst not see my faces (A.V. face): for there shall no man see me, and live" <a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>.<p>If, therefore, Moses could not see Him, much less could those who are in hell, where all are in things ultimate and most gross, and thus most remote from God; for they are natural in the lowest degree. Consequently, if Jehovah God had not assumed the Human, and so clothed Himself with a body which was in ultimates, He would have undertaken any work of redemption in vain. For who can attack an enemy unless he approaches him, and is equipped with arms for the fight? Or who can drive off and destroy dragons, serpents and basilisks in a desert unless he covers his body with a coat of mail and his head with a helmet, and advances with a spear in his hand? Or who can capture whales in the sea without a ship and the tackle necessary for the purpose? By such instances it may be possible, not indeed to make comparisons, but to illustrate how the omnipotent God could not have joined combat with the hells unless He had first assumed the Human.</p>
<p>
[2] It must be understood, however, that the Lord's combat with the hells was not one of words, as between opponents in a discussion or in a law-suit. Such a combat would be fruitless: but it was a spiritual combat, that of Divine Truth from Divine Good, which was the very vital principle of the Lord; and the influx of this, through the medium of sight, no one in the hells can resist. It has such power that the infernal spirits (genii), as soon as they perceive it, flee away, cast themselves into the depths and creep into caves to hide themselves, as is described in Isaiah:<p>"And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of JEHOVAH when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth" <a href="3927/isaiah_2_19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>;<p>and in the Revelation:<p>All "hid themselves in the dens of the rocks and in the rocks of the mountains: And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb" <a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15-16</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] What kind of power the Lord possessed from the Divine Good when He effected the Last Judgment in the year 1757 may be seen from what is described in the little work on that subject. It hurled from their places hills and mountains which infernal spirits had seized in the world of spirits, transporting them to a distance, and causing some to sink into the earth. It overwhelmed in a flood their cities, villages and fields, tore up their lands from their very depths, and cast them with their inhabitants into whirl-pools, swamps and marshes; and much more. All this was done by the Lord alone, by the power of Divine Truth from Divine Good. </p>

124. V. QUOD IPSA HAEC REDEMPTIO NON FIERI POTUERIT, QUAM PER DEUM INCARNATUM. In praecedente Articulo ostensum est, quod Redemptio fuerit Opus pure Divinum, consequenter quod non fieri potuerit nisi a Deo Omnipotente: quod non nisi quam per Se incarnatum, hoc est, factum Hominem, causa est, quia Jehovah Deus, qualis est in infinita sua essentia, non potest appropinquare ad Infernum, minus intrare in illud, est enim in purissimis et primis; quare Jehovah Deus, in se talis, si modo afflaret illos qui in Inferno sunt, momento enecaret illos, nam dixit ad Mosen volentem videre Ipsum, Non poteris videre facies meas, quia non videbit Me homo et vivet, <a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a> cum itaque Moses non potuit, minus adhuc <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
