826. Sometimes to the people in a Parisian community in the spiritual world, a woman appears in midair, wearing radiant clothes and having a saintly face. She says that she is Genevieve. When people begin to worship her, however, her face and clothes immediately change; she becomes like an ordinary woman. She criticizes the people for wanting to worship a woman who is no more esteemed among her friends than a servant girl would be. She expresses amazement that people in the world are taken with such nonsense. </p>

826. Apparet quandoque Parisiensibus qui in Mundo spirituali in Societate sunt, quaedam Mulier in media altitudine, in vestitu splendido, et in facie tanquam sancta, et dixit se esse GENOVEVAM: sed cum quidam incipiunt adorare illam, tunc illico mutatur ejus facies, et quoque vestis, et fit <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
