664. The fourth memorable occurrence. On one occasion I looked out into the spiritual world to my right and noticed some of the elect talking together.
<p>I went up to them and said, "I saw you from a distance. Around you there is a sphere of heavenly light, which told me that you are the type of people the Word refers to as 'the elect. ' Therefore I came over, in the hope of hearing what heavenly topic you were talking to each other about. "
<p>"Why are you calling us 'the elect'?" they asked.
<p>"Because in the world where I live physically," I replied, "people's only understanding is that 'the elect' in the Word mean people who were chosen by God and predestined for heaven, either before they were born or afterward. The thought is that these people alone are granted faith as a token of their having been chosen. The rest are rejected and left to themselves to wander whatever path they like toward hell.
<p>"I know, though, that there is no 'choosing' that takes place like this, either before birth or after it. All are chosen and predestined to heaven, because all are called. After they die, the Lord chooses those who, upon being examined, turn out to have lived good lives and to have believed the right things. Much experience has taught me that this is the truth. Because I saw you with a sphere of heavenly light around your heads, I perceived that you were among 'the elect,' who are being prepared for heaven. "
<p>"The beliefs you just mentioned are things we have never heard of before," they said. "Surely everyone knows that every single human being who is born is called to heaven. Of these, the people who believed in the Lord and lived by his commandments are chosen after death. To recognize any other method of selection is to accuse the Lord not only of being unable to save but also of being unjust!" </p>

talking to one another. I went up to them and said: 'I saw you from a distance, and you had a sphere of heavenly light around you. I knew from this that you belong to the people who are called in the Word the elect.' So I came to you to hear what is the heavenly matter you are talking about.'<p>'Why,' they replied, 'do you call us "the elect"?'<p>'Because,' I answered, 'in the world, where I am in the body, they know no better than that the elect in the Word means those who, either before they were born or after birth, were chosen by God and predestined for heaven. To them alone is faith given as a token of their election. The remainder are disapproved and left to themselves, to take whatever way they like to hell. Yet I know that no election takes place before birth or after it, but that all are chosen and predestined for heaven, because all are called. After death the Lord chooses those who have lived good lives and held a proper belief, and these only after they have been examined. I have been permitted to know that this is so by much experience. Since I saw that you had a sphere of heavenly light encircling your heads, I perceived that you belong to the elect who are being prepared for heaven.'<p>'What you report,' they replied, 'is something unheard of. Is there anyone who does not know that there is no person born who is not called to heaven, and that after death those of them are chosen who have believed in the Lord and have lived in accordance with His commandments? To acknowledge any other election would be to accuse the Lord not only of inability to save, but also of injustice.'<p>

664. Fourth Memorable Relation: <p>Once I looked toward the right in the spiritual world, and observed some of the elect conversing together. I approached them and said, "I saw you at a distance, and there was round about you a sphere of heavenly light, whereby I knew that you belonged to those who in the Word are called 'the elect;' therefore I drew near that I might hear what heavenly subject you were talking about." <p>They replied, "Why do you call us the elect?" <p>I answered, "Because in the world, where I am in the body, they have no other idea than that 'the elect' in the Word means those who are elected and predestined to heaven by God either before or after they are born, and that to such alone faith is given as a token of their election, and that the rest are held as reprobates, and are left to themselves, to go to hell whichever way they please. And yet I know that no election takes place before birth, nor after birth, but that all are elected and predestined to heaven, because all are called; also that after their death the Lord elects those who have lived well and believed aright; and this takes place after they have been examined. That this is so it has been granted me to learn by much observation. And because I saw that your heads were encircled by a sphere of heavenly light, I had a perception that you belonged to the elect who are preparing for heaven." <p>To this they replied, "You are telling things never before heard. Who does not know that there is no man born who is not called to heaven, and that from them after death those are elected who have believed in the Lord and have lived according to His commandments; and that to acknowledge any other election is to accuse the Lord Himself not only of being impotent to save, but also of injustice?" </p>

I drew near to them and said, "I saw you from a distance, and round about you a sphere of heavenly light, from which I knew that you were of those who in the Word are called the elect. I, therefore, came up to hear what heavenly subject you were discussing." They replied, "Why do you call us the elect?" "Because in the world," I replied, "where I am in the body, those are understood by the elect whom God elects and predestines for heaven, either before they are born, or afterwards.

Yet I know that no election is made either before or after birth, but that all are elected and predestined to heaven, because all are called; and that the Lord after death elects those who, after being examined, have been found to have lived well and believed aright.

664. QUARTUM MEMORABILE. Quondam prospexi in Mundum spiritualem ad dextrum, et animadverti aliquos ex ELECTIS inter se loquentes, et accessi ad illos, et dixi, vidi vos e longinquo, et circum vos sphaeram lucis coelestis, ex qua cognovi, quod vos sitis ex illis, qui in Verbo vocantur Electi, quare accessi audiendi causa, quid Coeleste inter vos loquimini; et respondebant, cur vocas nos Electos, ac retuli, quia in Mundo, ubi sum corpore, non sciunt aliter, quam quod per Electos in Verbo intelligantur illi, qui a Deo antequam nati sunt, aut postquam nati, eliguntur et praedestinantur ad Coelum, et quod illis solis donetur Fides ut tessera Electionis, et quod reliqui reprobentur, ac sibi relinquantur, ut vadant quamcunque viam velint ad Infernum; cum tamen ego scio, quod nulla Electio fiat ante nativitatem, nec post illam, sed quod omnes sint electi et praedestinati, quia omnes vocati sunt, ad Coelum, et quod Dominus post mortem eligat illos, qui bene vixerunt ac rite crediderunt, et hos postquam explorati sunt: quod ita sit, ex multa experientia mihi scire datum est, et quia vos vidi quoad capita sphaera lucis coelestis incinctos, percepi quod vos sitis ex Electis, qui praeparantur ad Coelum; ad haec responderunt, refers non prius audita; quis non scit, quod non nascatur aliquis homo, qui non vocatus est ad Coelum, et quod ex illis post mortem eligantur illi, qui crediderant in Dominum, et vixerant secundum praecepta Ipsius, et quod aliam Electionem agnoscere sit Ipsum Dominum non modo impotentiae salvandi sed etiam injustitiae arguere. </p>
