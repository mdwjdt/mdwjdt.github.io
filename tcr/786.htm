786. This New Church Is the Crown of All the Churches That Have Ever Existed on This Planet
<p>As I have shown above [760], to speak in general terms there have been four churches on this planet since the beginning: there was one before the Flood, a second after the Flood; the Israelite church was the third, and the church called Christian was the fourth.
<p>All churches depend on the recognition and acknowledgment of the one only God, with whom the individual in the church is able to form a partnership. Yet all four churches so far on this earth have lacked this truth. Therefore it follows that after these four will come a church that will recognize and acknowledge the one only God. God's divine love had no other purpose in creating the world than to unite humankind to himself, unite himself to humankind, and live with us in a partnership like this.
<p>The former churches lacked this truth, because the earliest church, which existed before the Flood, worshiped a God who could not be seen. No partnership is possible with a God like that. The early church, which existed after the Flood, did the same. The Israelite church worshiped Jehovah, who was essentially unable to be seen (<a href="3927/exodus_33_18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>), although Jehovah God did appear in a human form that he took on through an angel. In this form he appeared to Moses, Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Gideon, Joshua, and sometimes the prophets. That human form was a symbolic representation of the Lord who was yet to come. Because that form was symbolic, everything else in that church became symbolic as well. (It is well known that the sacrifices and other rituals of their worship symbolized the Lord who was to come, and that these symbolic acts were done away with when he came.)
</p>
<p>
[2] Now, the fourth church, which was called Christian, did indeed orally acknowledge one God, but a God in three persons, each of whom is individually a god in his own right. Therefore their Trinity was divided; it was not united in one Person. As a result, even though their lips would speak of one God, the picture of three gods was stuck fast in their minds. In fact, after the Council of Nicaea the church's theologians came up with a new teaching of their own. They said that we ought to believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, none of whom can be seen, because all three came into being with the same divine essence before the world began. And yet, as mentioned just above, it is not possible to form a partnership with a God who cannot be seen. People are therefore still unaware that the one only God, who cannot be seen, came into the world and took on a human manifestation, not only for the purpose of redeeming humankind but also in order to become someone we could see and form a partnership with. We read, "The Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh" (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). And in Isaiah, "A Child is born to us; a Son is given to us. His name will be called God, Hero, Father of Eternity" (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). The prophets also say many times that Jehovah himself is going to come into the world and become the Redeemer. This took place through the human manifestation he took on. </p>

786. X. This new church is the crown of all the churches which have up to now existed upon earth.<p>It was shown above that from the beginning there have been, generally speaking, four churches on this earth; one before the flood, one after the flood, a third the Israelite, and the fourth that named Christian. Since all churches depend upon the knowledge and acknowledgment of one God, with whom a member of the church can be linked, and since all four churches lacked that truth, it follows that a church will take the place of those four, which will know and acknowledge one God. God's Divine love had no other end in view in creating the world than the linking of man to Himself and of Himself to man, so that He might dwell with man. The reason why the former churches lacked that truth is that the Most Ancient Church, which existed before the flood, worshipped an invisible God, with whom no linking is possible. The Ancient Church, which existed after the flood, did likewise. The Israelite Church worshipped Jehovah, who is in Himself an invisible God (<a href="3927/exodus_33_18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>), but in human form, which Jehovah God put on by means of an angel; in this He was seen by Moses, Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Gideon, Joshua and on occasions by the Prophets. This human form was a representation of the Lord who was to come, and because this was representative, each and every detail in their church was made representative. It is well known that the sacrifices and other rites of their worship represented the Lord who was to come, and on His coming they were done away with.</p>
<p>
[2] The fourth church, however, that called Christian, certainly acknowledged in speech one God, but in three Persons, each of whom is singly or by Himself God, thus making a divided Trinity, not one united in one Person. Hence the idea of three Gods clung to their minds, although the expression 'one God' was upon their lips. Moreover, the doctors of the church by their own peculiar teaching, which they devised after the Council of Nicaea, teach that we should believe in God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, all being invisible, because they came into existence before the world having a similar essence - yet, as said above, linking is not possible with an invisible God; for they did not yet know that the one God, who is invisible, had come into the world, and had taken on human form, not only so as to redeem mankind, but also so as to become visible and thus capable of being linked with mankind. For we read:<p>The Word was with God, and the Word was God; and the Word was made flesh, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>And in Isaiah,<p>A boy is born for us, a son is given to us, whose name is God, Hero, the Everlasting Father, <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p>Many passages in the Prophets state that Jehovah Himself was to come into the world, to be the Redeemer; and this too He did in the human which He put on. </p>

786. X. THIS NEW CHURCH IS THE CROWN OF ALL THE CHURCHES THAT HAVE HITHERTO EXISTED ON THE EARTH. <p>It has been shown above that there have been, in general, from the beginning, four churches on this earth, one before the flood, the second after it, the third the Israelitish church, and the fourth that which is called the Christian church; and as all churches depend on a knowledge and acknowledgment of one God, with whom the man of the church can be conjoined, and as none of these four churches has possessed that truth, it follows that a church must follow these four which will know and acknowledge one God. The sole end of God's Divine love, when He created the world, was to conjoin man to Himself and Himself to man that He might thus dwell with man. This truth the former churches did not possess, the Most Ancient church, which preceded the flood, worshiping an invisible God with whom no conjunction is possible; the Ancient church which followed the flood, did likewise; the Israelitish church worshiped Jehovah, who in Himself is an invisible God (<a href="3927/exodus_33_18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>), but under a human form, which Jehovah God put on by means of an angel, in which He was seen by Moses, Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Gideon, Joshua, and sometimes by the prophets. This human form was a representative of the Lord who was to come, and because this was representative so each thing and all things in their church were made representative. It is a well known fact that the sacrifices and everything else pertaining to their worship represented the Lord who was to come, and that when He came they were abrogated. The fourth, which is called the Christian church, did indeed with the lips acknowledge one God, but in three Persons, each One of whom was singly or by Himself God; thus it acknowledged a divided Trinity, but not a Trinity united in one Person; and from this an idea of three Gods adhered to their minds, although the expression "one God" was on their lips. Moreover, the teachers of the church from that doctrine of theirs which they concocted after the Nicene Council, teach that men ought to believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, all of them invisible, because existent in a similar Divine essence before the world was (although, as said above, with an invisible God no conjunction is possible), for they still do not know that the one God who is invisible came into the world and assumed a Human, not only that He might redeem men, but also that He might become visible, that thereby conjunction with man might become possible. For we read: <p>The Word was with God, and God was the Word. And the Word was made flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). <p>And in Isaiah: <p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and His name, God, Mighty, Father of Eternity (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">9:6</a>). <p>It is also frequently declared in the Prophets that Jehovah Himself would come into the world, and would be a Redeemer, which He also became in the Human which He assumed. </p>

THIS NEW CHURCH IS THE CROWN OF ALL THE CHURCHES THAT HAVE HITHERTO EXISTED ON EARTH.<p>It has been shown above that there have existed on this earth from the beginning four Churches in general, one before the Flood, another after the Flood, a third called the Israelitish Church, and a fourth the Christian. Now all Churches depend on the knowledge and acknowledgment of one God with whom the man of the Church can be conjoined. As, however, all the four Churches were not in that truth, it follows that a Church is to succeed them which will know and acknowledge one God. For the Divine Love of God had no other end in creating the world than to conjoin man to Himself, and Himself to man, and thus to dwell with man. The former Churches were not in that truth, since the Most Ancient Church, which existed before the Flood, worshiped an invisible God, with whom there can be no conjunction; so also did the Ancient Church, which existed after the Flood; while the Israelitish Church worshiped Jehovah, who in Himself is an invisible God, <a href="3927/exodus_33_18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>, but under a human form. This form Jehovah God assumed by means of an angel, and in it He appeared to Moses, Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Gideon, Joshua, and sometimes to the Prophets. This human form was representative of the Lord who was to come; and this being representative, their sacrifices, and all else pertaining to their worship, represented the Lord who was to come, and that they were abrogated when He came.<p>The fourth Church, however, which was called Christian, acknowledged one God indeed with the lips, but in three Persons, each of whom singly or by Himself was God.

For it is written,<p>"The Word was with God, and the Word was God... and the Word became flesh" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>;<p>and in Isaiah,<p>"Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given... and His name...
