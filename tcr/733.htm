733. 第七组, 也就是其光线级别高, 以致其他人看不见的那支队伍, 来自东方天堂。 他们和拿号筒的天人同属一个社群。 当他们在天堂听说, 基督教界没有一个人知道何为天堂喜乐与永恒幸福时, 彼此说: “这不可能是真的。 基督徒中不会有这么浓重的黑暗和精神的麻木, 我们何不下去, 亲耳听听是不是真的? 若是真的, 那肯定是咄咄怪事。 ”<p>然后, 他们对拿号筒的天人说: “你知道, 每个人都想进天堂, 对天堂的喜悦也有自己的想法, 他们死后都被允许体验自己想象的快乐; 通过体验认识这些快乐的本质, 并意识到它们是自己头脑中的空洞观念和胡思乱想, 如此他们就被引导出来, 并接受教导。 精灵界的绝大数人, 若在世时深思天堂, 并对它的喜悦形成某种定见, 以至于渴望体验它们, 就会遇到这种情况。 ”听到这话, 拿号筒的天人对从基督教界的聪明人中召集来的六组人说: “随我来, 我会让你们体验你们所想象的快乐, 从而进入天堂。 ” </p>

733. The seventh group, which was not seen by the others because the light was in the others' eyes, was from the eastern part of heaven. Its members were angels from the same community as the angel with the trumpet. After hearing that not a single person in the entire Christian world knows what heavenly joy is or what eternal happiness is, they had said to each other, "This cannot possibly be true. Christians could never be that far in the dark or experience that degree of mental collapse. We should go down ourselves and hear if this is true or not; if it does turn out to be true, it is surely an omen of something. "
<p>At this point in the event, these angels said to the angel with the trumpet, "As you know, all people who have had a desire to go to heaven and have formed any particular conception of the joys heaven has in store for them are brought after they die to experience the joys they have been picturing. After they have explored the nature of their joys, and have experienced that their concepts of joy were based on empty ideas and insane fantasies, they are brought up out of those concepts and taught better ones. This is what happens in the world of spirits for most people who have meditated on heaven during their life on earth and who have come to some conclusion about the joys of heaven to the point where they desire to experience them. "
<p>Upon hearing this, the angel with the trumpet said to the six groups of wise people from the Christian world who had been summoned, "Follow me, and I will bring you into your joys and therefore into heaven. " </p>

733. The seventh group, whom the light rendered invisible to the rest, was from the east of heaven. They were angels from the same community as the angel with the trumpet. When the news reached them in heaven that not a single person in Christendom knew what the joy of heaven and everlasting happiness were, they said to one another: 'This cannot possibly be true. There cannot be such thick darkness and mental stupor among Christians. Why do we not go down too and hear whether this is true? If it is, it is certainly a portent.'<p>Then they said to the angel with the trumpet: 'You know that every person who had longed to go to heaven and had any definite ideas about its joys is after death allowed to experience the joys he imagined; and after they have found out by experience what those joys are like, and realised that they are empty ideas in their minds and ravings of their imaginations, they are taken away from them and taught. This happens to most people in the world of spirits, who in their previous lives had thought deeply about heaven, and come to some conclusion about its joys, so as to desire to experience them.' On hearing this the angel with the trumpet said to the six groups summoned from the wise of the Christian world: 'Follow me, and I shall bring you to experience the joys you imagine, and so into heaven.' </p>

733. The seventh company, which was invisible to the others because of its superior light, was from the eastern quarter of heaven. They were angels of the same society as that to which the angel who had the trumpet belonged. When these heard in heaven that not a single person in the Christian world knew what the joy of heaven and eternal happiness are, they said to each other, "Surely this cannot be true; there cannot be such thick darkness and such mental stupor among Christians; let us go down ourselves also, and hear whether it is true; if it is, it is certainly a wonder." <p>Then these angels said to the angel with the trumpet, "We know that every man who has desired heaven, and has thought at all definitely about the joys there, is introduced after death into these imagined joys; and after such have experienced the nature of these joys and found them to be according to the empty fancies of the mind and their wild imaginings, they are led out of them and instructed. This takes place with most of those in the world of spirits who in the former life had meditated about heaven, and had formed such conclusions about its joys as to desire them." <p>On hearing this the angel with the trumpet said to the six companies called together from the wise of the Christian world, "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joys, and thus into heaven." </p>

733. The seventh company, which was invisible to the rest on account of the light, was from the east of heaven, and consisted of angels of the society from which had come the angel with the trumpet. When they had heard in heaven that not a single person in the Christian world knew what heavenly joy and eternal happiness were, they said to one another: "Surely this cannot be true; there cannot be such gross darkness and mental stupor among Christians. Let us also go down and hear whether it is true; and if it is the truth, it is indeed most astonishing."<p>Then they said to the angel with the trumpet: "You know that all who had longed for heaven, and had formed any definite opinion concerning its joys, are introduced after death into such joys as they had imagined; and after they have found by experience the real nature of those joys, that they are figments of their own imagination and offspring of their delusion, they are withdrawn from them and instructed in the truth. In the world of spirits this happens to many who, in their former life when thinking of heaven, have come to the conclusion that its joys are such as they have longed for." On hearing this, the angel with the trumpet said to the six companies of wise men called together from the Christian world: "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joys, and thus into heaven." </p>

733. SEPTIMA COHORS prae luce non reliquis visa, erat ex Oriente Coeli; erant Angeli ex eadem Societate, e qua fuit Angelus tubae: illi cum in Coelo audiverunt, quod ne quidem unus in Christiano Orbe sciat, quid Gaudium Coeli, et Felicitas aeterna, inter se dixerunt, nequaquam hoc veritas est; non potest tanta caligo, et talis stupor mentium Christianis esse; descendamus etiam nos, et audiamus Numeri veritas sit, et si veritas est, sane est prodigium. Tunc Angeli illi dixerunt ad Angelum tubae, nosti quod unusquisque homo, qui desideraverat Coelum, et aliquid certi cogitaverat de gaudiis ibi, post mortem introducatur in imaginationis suae gaudia; et quod postquam experti sunt, qualia illa gaudia sunt, quod sint secundum vanas ideas mentis, et secundum deliria phantasiae illorum, educantur ab illis et instruantur; hoc fit plerisque in Mundo Spirituum, qui in priore vita meditati sunt de Coelo, et concluserunt aliquid de gaudiis ibi usque ad horum desiderium. His auditis, Angelus tubae dixit ad sex Cohortes ex Sapientibus Orbis Christiani convocatas, sequimini me, et introducam vos in Gaudia vestra, ita in Coelum. </p>
