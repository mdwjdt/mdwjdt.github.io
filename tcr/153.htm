<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>153</b>.（5）主凭自己通过父作工，反过来不行。此处作工和差圣灵意思一样，因为上述活动，就是一般来说改造，重生，更新，复活，成圣，称义，从恶中洁净，赦罪，得救，都是主的作为，尽管如今它们都被归给了单独为神的圣灵。主通过父执行这些事，反过来不行。这一点首先要通过圣言来证明，然后通过很多理性论据来说明。以下圣言经文有助于证明这一点：<br />我要从父那里给你们差保惠师来，就是从父出来真理的圣灵，祂要为我作见证。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">约翰福音15:26</a>）<br />我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差祂到你们这里来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.7.htm">约翰福音16:7</a>）<br />保惠师，真理的圣灵，不是凭自己说的；祂要将受于我的告诉你们。凡父所有的，都是我的；所以我说，祂要将受于我的告诉你们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">约翰福音16:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />那时还没有圣灵，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.39.htm">约翰福音7:39</a>）<br />耶稣向门徒吹气，说，你们受圣灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.22.htm">约翰福音20:22</a>）<br />你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成就，叫父因儿子得荣耀；你们若奉我的名求什么，我必成就。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.13.htm">约翰福音14:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这些经文清楚表明，是主差圣灵来，也就是说，是主执行如今被归给单独为神的圣灵的那些事。因为祂说，祂“要从父那里差保惠师来”，祂要“差它到他们这里来”，“ 那时还没有圣灵，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀”；祂得着荣耀后，就向门徒吹气说：“你们受圣灵”；祂还说，“你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成就”；保惠师“将受于我的告诉你们”。保惠师和圣灵是一样的（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">参看约翰福音14:26</a>）。以下经文表明，父神不会凭自己通过圣子赐下这些恩惠，而是圣子凭自己通过父这样做：<br />从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">约翰福音1:18</a>）<br />还有：<br />你们从来没有听见父的声音，也没有看见祂的形像。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">约翰福音5:37</a>）<br />由此可知，父神在圣子里面，并进入圣子作工，而非通过圣子作工；主凭自己通过祂的父作工。因为祂说：<br />凡父所有的，都是我的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">约翰福音16:15</a>）<br />父已将万有交在子手里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.35.htm">约翰福音3:35</a>）<br /><br />因为父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给子也照样在自己有生命。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">约翰福音5:26</a>）<br /><br />我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.63.htm">约翰福音6:63</a>）<br />主声称，真理的圣灵是从父出来的（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">约翰福音15:26</a>），因为它从父出来，进入子，并通过父从子而出。所以祂还说：<br />到那日你们就知道我在父里面，我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">约翰福音14:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">20</a>）<br />主的这些清清楚楚的声明将基督教界的错误表露无遗，即父神差圣灵给人；也将希腊教会的错误表露无遗，即父神直接差圣灵。主凭自己通过父神差圣灵，反过来不行。这一真理来自天堂，众天使称之为奥秘，因为它之前从未揭示给世人。</p>

153. (5)主代表父主動實行這些作為, 而非父通過主去實行這些作為。
<p>"實行這些作為"在這裡所指的意思是"發送聖靈"或"差送聖靈", 因為之前所列的神性活動——改造,更新,復興,啟動,成聖,稱義,潔淨,赦罪, 拯救等, 是主所做的。儘管當今時期人們視聖靈獨自是上帝,並把這些行為歸功給聖靈上帝。
<p>這些事情是由主代表父來完成的, 而非反過來。我先從聖言中列舉一些支持這點的經文, 再詳細說明。
<p>這些支持這個觀點的經文如下:我要從父那裡差保惠師來, 就是從父出來的真理的靈, 祂要為我作見證(<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">約翰福音15:26</a>)。我若不去, 保惠師就不到你們這裡為; 然而如果我去了, 我將差祂來(<a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">約翰福音16:7</a>)。保惠師, 真理的靈, 不會憑自己說什麼; 祂要將受於我的告訴你們。凡父所有的, 都是我的; 所以我說, 他要將受於我的告訴你們(<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">約翰福音16:13-15</a>)。那時還沒有聖靈, 因為耶穌尚未被榮耀(<a href="3927/john_7_39.htm">約翰福音7:39</a>)。耶穌吹氣給門徒, 說:"受聖靈"(<a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">約翰福音20:22</a>)。你們奉我的名無論求什麼, 我必成就, 為了叫父因兒子得榮耀; 因此你們若奉我的名求什麼, 我必成就(<a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">約翰福音14:13-14</a>)。
<p>[2]從這些經文, 清楚顯明, 是主差送聖靈, 也就是完成這些作為。如今人們卻將這些工作歸功給聖靈上帝, 視聖靈憑自己為一位上帝。主說祂要從父差送聖靈; 祂將要差送聖靈"給你們"; 聖靈還未有, 因為耶穌未榮耀; 當耶穌榮耀後, 祂吹氣給門徒說:"受聖靈"; 主還說:"奉我的名無論你們求什麼, 我必成就"; 聖靈說的是"受於我的"告訴你們(保惠師就是聖靈, 見<a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">約翰福音14:26</a>)。
<p>並不是父通過子,自己來實行這些活動和作用, 而是子代表父主動來實行。聖言中清楚說明這點:"沒有人看見過父; 是父懷中的獨生子將祂顯明"(<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">約翰福音1:18</a>及其它)。"你們從未聽過父的聲音, 或見過祂的形像"(<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">約翰福音5:37</a>)。
<p>[3]由此得知, 父上帝在子之中,在子身上工作, 而非通過子去工作。是主自己代表父主動工作, 因為祂說:"凡父所有的, 都是我的"(<a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">約翰福音16:15</a>); "父已將萬有交在子手裡"(<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">約翰福音3:35</a>); 還有, "父怎樣自己有生命, 就賜給祂兒子也照樣在自己有生命"(<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">約翰福音5:26</a>); "我對你們所說的話就是靈, 就是生命"(<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">約翰福音6:63</a>)。
<p>無可否認, 主確實說真理的靈出自于父, "我要從父那裡差保惠師來"(<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">約翰福音15:26</a>)。然而, 祂這樣說, 是因為真理之靈由父而出,進入子, 子代表父從祂發出。所以說:"到那日, 你們就知道我在父裡面, 你們在我裡面, 我也在你們裡面(<a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">約翰福音14:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>)。"
<p>主的這些直白之言將基督徒世界的錯誤(就是父上帝差送聖靈給人)顯露無遺。還有希臘教會的錯誤, 他們認為父上帝直接差送聖靈, 沒有任何環節。
<p>主自己代表父來差送聖靈, 而不是父通過子差聖靈, 這個概念來自天上。天人們稱之為奧秘, 因為之前未曾在世間揭示過。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
153. 5. The Lord takes these actions on his own initiative on behalf of the Father, not the other way around. The reference to "taking actions" in this opening sentence means the same thing as "sending the Holy Spirit," since the processes listed above - reforming, regenerating, renewing, bringing to life, sanctifying, justifying, [purifying] from evils, and forgiving sins - which are attributed these days to the Holy Spirit as a God by himself, are actually processes carried out by the Lord.
<p>As for the point that these processes are carried out by the Lord on behalf of the Father and not the other way around, I will first support this from the Word and then illustrate it with parallels.
<p>Support from the Word occurs in the following passages:
<p>When the Comforter comes, whom I am going to send from the Father - the Spirit of Truth that goes out from the Father - he will testify about me. (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>)
<p>If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I do go away, I will send him to you. (<a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>)
<p>The Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, will not speak to you on his own; he will take from what is mine and make it known to you. All things whatever that the Father has are mine. This is why I said that he will take from what is mine and make it known to you. (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>)
<p>The Holy Spirit was not yet in existence, because Jesus was not glorified yet. (<a href="3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>)
<p>Jesus breathed on the disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. " (<a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>)
<p>Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, so that the Father is glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I myself will do it. (<a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] From these passages it is perfectly obvious that the Lord "sends the Holy Spirit," that is, carries out those processes that are ascribed nowadays to the Holy Spirit as a God by himself. The Lord said that he was going to send the Holy Spirit from the Father; he was going to send the Holy Spirit "to you. " Furthermore, the Holy Spirit was not yet in existence, because Jesus was not glorified yet; and after Jesus was glorified he breathed on the disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. " The Lord also said "Whatever you ask in my name, I myself will do it;" and said that the Comforter was going to take "from what is mine" that which he was to make known. (For evidence that the Comforter is the same as the Holy Spirit, see <a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>.)
<p>It is not that God the Father carries out those processes on his own initiative through the Son, but rather that the Son carries them out on his own initiative on behalf of the Father, as the following passages clearly show: "No one has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, who is close to the Father's heart, has made him visible" (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a> and elsewhere). "You have never heard the voice of the Father or seen what he looks like" (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] From these passages it follows that God the Father works on and in the Son but not through him. Instead, the Lord works on his own initiative on behalf of his Father. For he says, "Everything the Father has is mine" (<a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>). "The Father has given all things into the hand of the Son" (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>). Also, "as the Father has life in himself, so he has given the Son to have life in himself" (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>). And "the words that I speak are spirit and are life" (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>).
<p>Admittedly, the Lord does say that the Spirit of Truth goes out from the Father (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>). The reason he says this, however, is that the Spirit of Truth goes out from God the Father into the Son, and it goes out from the Son on behalf of the Father. This is why it says, "In that day you will recognize that the Father is in me and I am in the Father, and you are in me and I am in you" (<a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">John 14:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>).
<p>The Lord's clear statements reveal as blatantly incorrect the Christian world's belief that God the Father sends the Holy Spirit to us. The Greek Church, as well, is wrong to believe that God the Father sends the Holy Spirit directly.
<p>The concept that the Lord sends the Holy Spirit on his own initiative on behalf of God the Father, not the other way around, comes from heaven. Angels call it a secret that has not yet been discovered in the world. </p>

153. (v) THE LORD WORKS OF HIMSELF FROM THE FATHER, AND NOT THE REVERSE.<p>Working here means much the same as sending the Holy Spirit, since the activities listed above, which are in general reformation, regeneration, renewal, quickening, sanctification, justification, [cleansing] from evils, forgiveness of sins [and salvation], are the Lord's doing, though at the present time they are attributed to the Holy Spirit as an independent God. These things are performed by the Lord from the Father, and not the reverse, as will first be proved from the Word and then illustrated by many reasoned arguments. The following passages from the Word will serve:<p>When the Comforter comes whom I shall send from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes forth from the Father, he will bear witness about me, <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>.<p>If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go away, I will send him to you, <a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>.<p>The Comforter, the Spirit of truth, will not speak of himself, but he will receive of mine and tell it to you. Everything that the Father has is mine; it is for this reason that I said that he would receive of mine and tell it to you, <a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>.<p>The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified, <a href="3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>.<p>Jesus breathed on the disciples and said, Receive the Holy Spirit, <a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>.<p>Whatever you ask in my name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I shall do it, <a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] These passages show clearly that it is the Lord who sends the Holy Spirit, that is to say, performs the works which at the present day are attributed to the Holy Spirit as an independent God. For He said that He would send him from the Father; that He would send him to you; that the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified; that after He was glorified He breathed on the disciples and said, Receive the Holy Spirit; He also said, Whatever you ask in my name, I will do, and also that the Comforter will receive of mine what he is to tell. The Comforter is identical with the Holy Spirit; see <a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>. The following passages show that God the Father does not confer these benefits of Himself acting through the Son, but the Son does so of Himself from the Father:<p>No one has ever seen God; the only-begotten Son, who is in the Father's bosom, He has revealed Him, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>.<p>Elsewhere:<p>You have never heard the Father's voice, nor have you seen His appearance, <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] So it follows from these passages that God the Father works in the Son and upon the Son, not through the Son; but the Lord works of Himself<p>from His Father, for He says:<p>All things of the Father's are mine, <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>. The Father has given all things into the hand of the Son, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>.<p>Also:<p>As the Father has life in Himself, so did He grant the Son to have life in Himself, <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>.<p>The words which I speak are spirit and life, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>.<p>The Lord says that the Spirit of truth comes forth from the Father (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>), because it comes forth from the Father into the Son, and out of the Son from the Father. For this reason too He says:<p>On that day you will know that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father, and you are in me and I am in you, <a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">John 14:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>.<p>These plain sayings of the Lord's show up the manifest error of the Christian world, that it is God the Father who sends the Holy Spirit to men, as well as the error of the Greek church, that God the Father sends Him without any mediation. This teaching, that the Lord of Himself sends the Holy Spirit from God the Father, and not the reverse, has come to me from heaven; the angels call it a secret, because it has not previously been revealed in the world. </p>

153. (5) The Lord operates of Himself from the Father, and not the reverse. To operate here means the same as sending the Holy Spirit, since the above mentioned operations (which, in general, are reformation, regeneration, renewal, vivification, sanctification, justification, purification from evils, and forgiveness of sins and salvation), which are at this day attributed to the Holy Spirit as a God by Himself, are operations of the Lord. That these are of the Lord from the Father and not the reverse, shall first be proved from the Word, and afterwards illustrated by various things that appeal to the reason. From the Word by the following passages: <p>When the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father, the Spirit of truth that goes forth from the Father, He shall bear witness of Me (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>). <p>If I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go away I will send Him unto you (<a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>). <p>The Comforter, the Spirit of truth, shall not speak from Himself, but He shall take of Mine and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine; therefore said I that He shall take of Mine and shall declare it unto you (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>). <p>The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (<a href="3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>). <p>Jesus breathed on the disciples and said, Receive ye the Holy Spirit (<a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>). <p>Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name I will do it (<a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13, 14</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] From these passages it is very evident that the Lord sends the Holy Spirit, that is, effects those things which at this day are ascribed to the Holy Spirit as a God by Himself; for He says that "He will send the Comforter from the Father," that "He will send it to them," that "the Holy Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified;" and after the glorification He breathed on the disciples and said, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit;" also that He said, "Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do;" and that the Comforter "shall take of Mine what He is to declare." That the Comforter and the Holy Spirit are the same see<a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>. That God the Father does not operate these energies of Himself through the Son, but that the Son operates them of Himself from the Father, is evident from the following: <p>No one hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath brought Him forth to view (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>). <p>And elsewhere: <p>Ye have neither heard the Father's voice at any time nor seen His form (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] From all this it follows that God the Father operates in and into the Son, but not through the Son; also that the Lord operates of Himself from His Father; for He says: <p>All things of the Father are Mine (<a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>). <p>The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>). <p>Again: <p>As the Father hath life in Himself so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>). <p>And again: <p>The words that I speak unto you are spirit and are life (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>). <p>The Lord declares that the Spirit of truth goes forth from the Father (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>), because it goes forth from God the Father into the Son, and out of the Son from the Father. Therefore He also says: <p>In that day ye shall know that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father, and ye in Me and I in you (<a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">John 14:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>). <p>From these plain declarations of the Lord an error of the Christian world is clearly manifest, namely, that God the Father sends the Holy Spirit to man; also the error of the Greek Church, which is, that God the Father sends the Holy Spirit directly. The truth that the Lord of Himself from God the Father sends the Holy Spirit, and not the reverse, is from heaven. The angels call this an arcanum because it has not before been disclosed to the world. </p>

153. (5) THE LORD OPERATES OF HIMSELF FROM THE FATHER, AND NOT THE REVERSE.<p>By operating is here meant the same as sending the Holy Spirit, since the operations already mentioned are operations of the Lord. They are in general, reformation, regeneration, renewal, vivification, sanctification, justification, purification from evils, remission of sins and salvation, which are at this day ascribed to the Holy Spirit as a God by Himself. That these operations are of the Lord from the Father, and not the reverse, will be first confirmed from the Word, and then illustrated by rational considerations. It is confirmed from the Word by the following passages:<p>"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of me" <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>.<p>"If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you" <a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>.<p>The Comforter, the Spirit of truth "shall not speak of Himself... He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine... therefore said I, that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you" <a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>.<p>"The Holy Spirit was not yet; because that Jesus was not yet glorified" <a href="3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>.<p>Jesus breathed on the disciples, "and saith, Receive ye the Holy Spirit" <a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>.<p>"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it" <a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>.<p>From these passages it is clear that the Lord sends the Holy Spirit, that is, that it is He who effects those operations which are at this day ascribed to the Holy Spirit as a God by Himself: for He said that He would send the Holy Spirit from the Father; and that He would send Him to you. That the Lord sends the Holy Spirit is also clear from the statements that the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified; that after His glorification He breathed on His disciples, and said: "Receive ye the Holy Spirit;" that He also said: "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do;" and that the Comforter would receive from Him what He should announce. The Comforter is the same as the Holy Spirit, as may be seen from <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>. God the Father does not render these virtues effective of Himself through the Son, but the Son of Himself from the Father, as is evident from the following:<p>"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him" <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>;<p>and in another place:<p>"Ye have neither heard the Father's (A.V., His) voice at any time, nor seen His shape <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.<p>Accordingly it follows from these statements that God the Father operates in and upon the Son, but not through Him, while the Lord operates of Himself from His Father; for He says:<p>"All things that the Father hath are mine" <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>; that the Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>;<p>also:<p>"As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself" <a href="3927/john_5_28.htm">John 5:28</a>;<p>and further:<p>"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life" <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>.<p>The Lord says that the Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>) because it proceeds from God the Father into the Son, and out of the Son from the Father. Therefore He also says:<p>"At that day ye shall know that the Father is in me... and that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" <a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">John 14:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>.<p>From these plain statements of the Lord the error of the Christian world is clearly manifest, namely that God the Father sends the Holy Spirit to man; and also the error of the Greek Church that God the Father sends out the Holy Spirit immediately. This truth, that the Lord sends it of Himself from God the Father, and not the reverse, is from heaven; and the angels call it a mystery, because it has not hitherto been revealed to the world. </p>

153. V. QUOD DOMINUS OPERETUR EX SE A PATRE, ET NON VICISSIM. Per Operari hic simile intelligitur, quod per mittere Spiritum Sanctum, quoniam supramemoratae Operationes, quae sunt in genere, Reformatio, Regeneratio, Innovatio, Vivificatio, Sanctificatio, Justificatio[, Purificatio] a malis, Remissio peccatorum, quae hodie attribuuntur Spiritui Sancto ut Deo per se, sunt Operationes Domini: quod hae sint ex Domino a Patre, et non vicissim, primum confirmabitur ex Verbo, et postea per plura quae rationis sunt, illustrabitur: ex Verbo ab his, "Quando venerit Paracletus, QUEM EGO MISSURUS SUM A PATRE, Spiritus veritatis, qui a Patre exit, ille testabitur de Me, <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">Johannes 15:26</a>. Si non abivero, Paracletus non veniet ad vos; si vero abivero, MITTAM ILLUM AD VOS, <a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">Johannes 16:7</a>. Paracletus, Spiritus veritatis, non loquetur ex se ipso, sed EX MEO ACCIPIET et annuntiabit vobis; omnia quaecunque Pater habet, MEA SUNT; propter hoc dixi, quod EX MEO accepturus sit, et annuntiaturus vobis, <a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">Johannes 16:13-14</a>, <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">15</a>. Spiritus Sanctus nondum erat, quia Jesus nondum glorificatus est, <a href="3927/john_7_39.htm">Johannes 7:39</a>. Jesus inspiravit in Discipulos, et dixit, accipite Spiritum Sanctum, <a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">Johannes 20:22</a>. Quodcunque petieritis in Nomine meo, HOC FACIAM, ut glorificetur Pater in Filio; si quid petieritis in Nomine meo, EGO FACIAM," <a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">Johannes 14:13-14</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Ex his locis manifeste patet, quod Dominus mittat Spiritum Sanctum, hoc est, operetur illa, quae hodie adscribuntur Spiritui Sancto ut Deo per se; dixit enim quod missurus sit illum a Patre, quod missurus sit illum ad vos, quod nondum fuerit Spiritus Sanctus, quia Jesus nondum glorificatus est, quod post glorificationem inspiraverit in Discipulos et dixerit accipite Spiritum Sanctum; tum quod dixerit, quodcunque petieritis in Nomine meo, Ego faciam, ut et, quod Paracletus ex Meo accepturus sit quod annuntiabit: quod Paracletus sit idem cum Spiritu Sancto, videatur <a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">Johannes 14:26</a>. Quod Deus Pater non operetur illas virtutes ex se per Filium, sed quod Filius ex se a Patre, constat ex his, Deum nemo vidit unquam; Unigenitus Filius, qui in sinu Patris est ille exposuit, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">Johannes 1:18</a>. Et alibi, Non vocem Patris audivistis usquam; nec speciem Ipsius vidistis, <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">Johannes 5:37</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Ex his itaque sequitur, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
quod Deus Pater operetur in Filio et in Filium, sed non per Filium, verum quod Dominus operetur ex Se a suo Patre, nam dicit, Omnia Patris mea sunt, <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">Johannes 16:15</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Quod Pater omnia dederit in manum Filii, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">Johannes 3:35</a>. Tum Quod sicut Pater habet vitam in se Ipso, ita dederit Filio vitam habere in se ipso, <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">Johannes 5:26</a>, ut et, Verba quae Ego loquor, spiritus et vita sunt, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">Johannes 6:63</a>. Quod Dominus dicat quod Spiritus veritatis exeat a Patre, <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">Johannes 15:26</a>, est quia a Deo Patre exit in Filium, et ex Filio a Patre; quare etiam dicit, In illa die cognoscetis quod Pater in Me, et Ego in Patre, et vos in Me, et Ego in vobis, <a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">Johannes 14:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>. Ex his perspicuis effatis Domini manifeste patet error in Christiano Orbe, qui est, quod Deus Pater mittat Spiritum Sanctum ad hominem; et error Ecclesiae Graecae, quod Deus Pater Illum immediate mittat: hoc, quod Dominus ex Se a Deo Patre illum mittat, et non vicissim, est e Coelo, et Angeli illud vocant Arcanum, quia nondum in Mundo detectum.<p>
