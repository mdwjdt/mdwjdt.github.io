853. A Proposition Put Forward by a Certain Duke-Elector in Germany, Who Had Also Held the Highest Ecclesiastical Office in His Province
<p>On one occasion I saw in the spiritual world a certain duke-elector in Germany who had also held the highest position among the church leaders in his province. Next to him there were two bishops and two ministers. From a distance I heard what they were saying to each other. The duke-elector was asking the other four whether they knew what constitutes the theological pinnacle of Christianity.
<p>The bishops replied, "The theological pinnacle of Christianity is the teaching that faith alone justifies and saves. "
<p>The duke-elector then asked them a further question: "Do you know what lies inwardly hidden in that faith? Remove the lid from it, look inside, and tell me what you see. "
<p>"The only thing that lies hidden inside it," they said, "is the merit and justice of the Lord our Savior. "
<p>"Isn't it true, then," the duke-elector said, "that what lies hidden inside it is the Lord our Savior in his human manifestation, whose name is Jesus Christ? In his human manifestation he alone was Justice. "
<p>"Yes, this clearly and definitely follows," they said.
<p>The duke-elector pressed on by saying, "Open up that faith and look inside it further and search well to see whether there is anything else in there. "
<p>The ministers said, "The grace of God the Father also lies hidden within it. "
<p>The duke-elector said, "If your conception and perception is accurate, you will see that it is the grace of the Son with the Father. It is the Son who petitions and intercedes.
<p>"Therefore I say to you, since you confess, venerate, and embrace that faith alone of yours, you must in every way confess, venerate, and embrace the Lord alone - the Lord our Savior in his human manifestation.
<p>"As we noted before, in his human manifestation the Lord himself was and is Justice. In the following passages from the sacred pages I observe that in his human manifestation he himself is also Jehovah and God: 'Behold, the days are coming when I will raise up for David a righteous offshoot who will reign as king and will prosper. And they will call him by this name: Jehovah is our Justice' (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>). In Paul, 'All the fullness of divinity dwells physically in Jesus Christ' (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). In John, 'Jesus Christ is the true God and eternal life' (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). Therefore he is also called 'the God of faith' (<a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). " </p>

A proposition put forward by a certain Duke, an Elector of Germany, who also held the highest rank in the church.<p>Once I saw in the spiritual world a certain Duke who was an Elector of Germany, and who also held the highest rank in the church. He had two bishops beside him, and also two ministers. I could hear, though some way off, what they were discussing. The Duke Elector asked the four in attendance whether they knew what constitutes the chief point of religion in Christendom. 'The chief point of religion in Christendom,' said the bishops, 'is faith alone justifying and saving.' He asked again, 'Do you know what lies hidden within that faith? Open it up, look inside, and tell me.' They replied that what lay hidden within it was nothing other than the merit and righteousness of the Lord the Saviour. To this the Duke Elector said, 'Then does not the Lord the Saviour lie hidden in it in His Human, in which He is called Jesus Christ, because in His Human He alone was righteousness?' To this they said, 'Yes, this follows certainly and inevitably.'<p>The Duke Elector pressed them, saying, 'Open up that faith and take another look inside; search carefully to see whether there is not something else inside.' The ministers said, 'There is also hidden in it the grace of God the Father.' To this the Duke Elector said, 'Form a correct idea and perception, and you will see that it is the grace of the Son with the Father, for it is the Son who begs and intercedes. Therefore I tell you, since you confess, reverence and kiss that faith alone of yours, to be sure to confess, reverence and kiss the Lord alone as Saviour in His Human. For, as I said before, He in His Human was and is righteousness. I have seen in Holy Scripture that He in His Human is also Jehovah and God, as in these passages:<p>Behold, the days will come, when I shall raise up a righteous shoot for David, who will reign as king and prosper. And this is the name by which they will call him, Jehovah our righteousness, <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>.<p>In Paul:<p>In Jesus Christ all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>.<p>And in John:<p>Jesus Christ is the true God, and everlasting life. <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>That too is why He is called 'the God of faith' (<a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>).<p>

A THEOREM PROPOSED BY A CERTAIN DUKE, AN ELECTOR IN GERMANY, WHO ALSO ENJOYED THE HIGHEST ECCLESIASTICAL DIGNITY. <p>I once saw in the spiritual world a certain duke, an elector in Germany, who also enjoyed the highest ecclesiastical dignity, and near him two bishops and two ministers, and from a distance I heard their conversation. The electoral duke asked the four bystanders whether they knew what constitutes the head of religion in Christendom. The bishops replied, "The head of religion in Christendom is faith alone justifying and saving." Again he asked, "Do you know what lies concealed within that faith? Open it, look into it, and tell me." They replied, "That there was nothing concealed within it but the merit and righteousness of the Lord the Savior." To this the electoral duke answered, "Is there not concealed in it, then, the Lord the Savior in His Human, in which He is called Jesus Christ, because He alone in His Human is Righteousness?" To this they replied, "That certainly and inseparably follows." The electoral duke persisted, saying, "Open that faith, look into it further, examine it well, and see whether there is not something else in it." And the ministers said, "The grace of God the Father is also concealed in it." To this the electoral duke answered, "Obtain a right conception and perception of the subject, and you will see that it is the Son's grace with the Father, for the Son begs and intercedes. Therefore I say to you, since you confess, revere, and kiss that faith alone of yours, you ought by all means to confess, revere, and kiss the Lord the Savior in His Human alone; for, as just said, He in His Human was and is Righteousness. That in this Human He is also Jehovah and God I saw in the Sacred Writings from the following passages: <p>Behold, the days will come, when I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and He shall reign as a King and prosper; and this is His name whereby He shall be called, Jehovah our Righteousness (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>). <p>In Paul: <p>In Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fullness of Deity bodily (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). <p>And in John: <p>Jesus Christ is the true God and eternal life (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). <p>Wherefore He is also called: <p>The God of faith (<a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). <p>

853. [XII.] A QUESTION PROPOSED BY A CERTAIN ELECTORAL DUKE OF GERMANY, WHO ALSO HELD HIGH RANK IN THE CHURCH.<p>I once saw in the spiritual world a certain Electoral Duke of Germany, who also held high rank in the Church. Beside him I saw two bishops and also two ministers; and I was near enough to hear their conversation. The Elector asked the four who were standing beside him whether they knew what constituted the cardinal element of religion in Christendom. The bishops answered: "The cardinal element of religion in Christendom is faith alone, which justifies and saves." He asked again: "Do you know what lies inwardly concealed in that faith? Examine it carefully, and tell me." They replied: "Nothing lies inwardly concealed in it but the merit and righteousness of the Lord the Savior." Thereupon the Elector said: "Does it involve then the Lord the Savior in His Human, in which He is called Jesus Christ, since He alone in His Human was righteousness?' They said: "This follows assuredly and inevitably." The Elector, following up the subject, said: Examine it still more carefully and see whether it contains anything else."<p>Then the ministers observed: "There is also involved in it the grace of God the Father." To this the Elector said: "If you form a just conception and a clear perception of the matter, you will see that it is the grace of the Son with the Father; for it is the Son who entreats and intercedes. I, therefore, make bold to say to you that since you confess, venerate and embrace this as your view of faith alone, you will unreservedly confess, venerate and embrace the Lord the Savior alone in His Human; for, as was just pointed out, He in His Human was and is Righteousness. He in His Human is also Jehovah and God, as I have perceived in the Sacred Scriptures from these passages:<p>"Behold, the days come... that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, who (A.V., and a King) shall reign and prosper... and this is His name whereby He shall be called JEHOVAH our Righteousness." [<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>]; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>;<p>In Paul,<p>In Jesus Christ "dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily," <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>;<p>and in John,<p>"Jesus Christ is the true God and eternal life" <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20-21</a>;<p>and therefore He is also called:<p>"The God of faith" <a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a> </p>
