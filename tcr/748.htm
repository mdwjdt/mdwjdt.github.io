</h4>
<p>
748. After that, the angel guide spoke to some of the other guests about the ten newcomers who were with him. He told them that he had been commanded to bring the newcomers up to this community and show them the magnificent and miraculous things in the prince's palace. "They also dined with the prince at his table," he said, "and afterward had a chance to converse with some of the wise minds in our community. "
<p>The angel then asked the guests, "Would it be possible for the newcomers to have a conversation with you as well?"
<p>They agreed and struck up a conversation. One of the men in attendance at the wedding, a wise person, said to the newcomers, "Do you understand the meaning of what you saw just now?"
<p>The newcomers said, "A little. " They asked the wise person, "Why was the bridegroom (now the husband) wearing those particular clothes?"
<p>"The bridegroom (now the husband) was representing the Lord," he replied, "and the bride (now the wife) was representing the church, because weddings in heaven represent the marriage between the Lord and the church. This is why he had a turban on his head, and why he was wearing a robe, a tunic, and an ephod like Aaron [Exodus 28; ]. This is also why the bride (now the wife) had a crown on her head and was wearing a robe like that of a queen. Tomorrow they will dress differently, because this representation lasts only for today. "
</p>
<p>
[2] The newcomers had another question: "Given that he represented the Lord and she the church, why was she sitting to his right?"
<p>"Because there are two things," the wise guest replied, "that make a marriage between the Lord and the church: love and wisdom. The Lord is love and the church is wisdom. Wisdom is at love's right hand. All who are in the church become wise as if they were doing so on their own, and as they become wise, they receive love from the Lord. The right hand means power, and it is through wisdom that love has power.
<p>"As I say, though, after the wedding day is over the representation changes. Then the husband represents wisdom and the wife represents the love of that wisdom; but this latter love is not the love I mentioned a moment ago. It is a second kind of love, which the wife has from the Lord in response to her husband's wisdom. The kind of love from the Lord mentioned earlier is the love for becoming wise that the husband has. Therefore after the wedding day, both together, the husband and the wife, represent the church. "
</p>
<p>
[3] The newcomers had yet another question: "Why were none of you men standing beside the groom (now the husband) the way the six young women were standing beside the bride (now the wife)?"
<p>"The reason is that on this day," the wise person replied, "we ourselves are counted as virginal young women, and the number six means wholeness and completeness. "
<p>"We don't understand," the newcomers said.
<p>"Virginal young women mean the church," the wise man said, "and both sexes constitute the church. In this sense, where the church is concerned we men too are considered to be virginal young women. This is made clear by the following statement in the Book of Revelation: 'These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they themselves are virgins, and they follow the Lamb wherever he goes' (<a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>). Because young women mean the church, therefore the Lord compared the church to ten young women who were invited to a wedding (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a> and following). Because Israel, Zion, and Jerusalem mean the church, therefore the Word often speaks of a virgin or daughter of Israel, of Zion, or of Jerusalem. In fact, the Lord describes his marriage with the church in the following terms in David: 'The queen stands at your right hand in the best gold from Ophir; her clothing is interwoven with gold. In embroidered clothes she will be brought to her king; young women behind her as her friends will come into the palace of the king' (<a href="3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9-15</a>). "
</p>
<p>
[4] Then the newcomers asked, "Wouldn't it be more appropriate for a priest to be present and administer the ceremony?"
<p>"That is appropriate on earth," the wise man responded, "but not in the heavens, because the ceremony here represents the Lord himself and the church. People on earth are not aware that weddings have this symbolic meaning. Still, among us here priests do indeed perform betrothal ceremonies; they hear, accept, confirm, and consecrate the couple's consent to be married. Consent is the essential ingredient in a marriage; all the other aspects of marriage that follow from consent are just the various forms that that consent takes. " </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #748 (Chadwick, 1988)

<p>
748. Afterwards the angel guide spoke with the guests about his ten companions, telling them that he had been ordered to bring them into the community, and how he had shown them the magnificence of the prince's palace and the wonders it contained, and how they had feasted at the prince's table. Afterwards they had talked with their wise men, and he asked the guests to permit the ten to have some conversation with them too. So they went to them and they talked together.<p>One of the wise men who was at the wedding said: 'Do you understand the meaning of what you saw?' They said they understood only a little, and they asked him why the bridegroom, who was now the husband, was dressed in this way. He replied that the bridegroom, who was now the husband, represented the Lord, and the bride, who was now the wife, represented the church, because weddings in heaven represent the marriage of the Lord with the church. 'That,' he said, 'is why he had a mitre on his head, and he was dressed in a mantle, a tunic and an ephod like Aaron. That too is why the bride, now the wife, had a crown on her head and wore a cloak like a queen. Tomorrow they will be dressed differently, because this representative role lasts only for today.'</p>
<p>
[2] They asked a second question: 'Since he represents the Lord and she the church, why did she sit on his right?' 'Because,' said the wise man, 'there are two things which make the marriage of the Lord and the church, love and wisdom; and the Lord is love and the church is wisdom. Wisdom is at the right hand of love, because a member of the church has wisdom as if from himself, and to the extent that he is wise, he receives love from the Lord. The right hand also stands for power, and love gets its power by means of wisdom. But as I said, after the wedding the representation is changed, for then the husband represents wisdom, and the bride the love for his wisdom. Yet this love is not the primary one, but a secondary love, which the wife gets from the Lord by means of the husband's wisdom. The love of the Lord, which is the primary love, is a love of being wise in the husband. So after the wedding, the husband and his wife together represent the church.'</p>
<p>
[3] They asked another question: 'Why did you men not stand at the side of the bridegroom, now the husband, as the six maidens stood at the side of the bride, who is now the wife?' 'The reason,' replied the wise man, 'is that to-day we are counted among the maidens, and the number six stands for all and for what is complete.' 'Why is this?' they said. 'Maidens stand for the church, which is composed of people of both sexes. We too, therefore, in respect to the church are maidens. This passage in Revelation proves that this is so:<p>These are they who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are maidens, and they follow the Lamb wherever he goes, <a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>.<p>It was because maidens stand for the church that the Lord likened it to the ten maidens or virgins invited to a wedding (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>ff). It is because Israel, Zion and Jerusalem stand for the church that the Word says so many times 'the virgin or daughter of Israel, Zion and Jerusalem.' The Lord also describes His marriage with the church in these words from the Psalms of David:<p>The queen is at your right hand in the finest gold of Ophir, her clothing is woven with gold; in embroidered garments she will be brought to the king, and after her the maidens, her friends, will come into the king's palace, <a href="3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9-15</a>.'</p>
<p>
[4] Afterwards they said: 'Surely it is appropriate to have a priest present to conduct a service over them?' 'This is appropriate,' said the wise man, 'on earth, but not in the heavens, because they represent the Lord Himself and the church. This fact is unknown on earth. Yet with us a priest conducts engagement ceremonies, and hears, receives, confirms and consecrates their consent. Consent is the essential feature of marriage, and the other ceremonies which follow are its formal expression.' </p>

<p>
748. The angel guide then told the guests about his ten companions, saying that he had introduced them by command, had shown them the magnificence of the prince's palace, and the wonderful things it contained, that they had dined with the prince; and afterward conversed with the wise men of the society. And he asked, "Will you permit them to have a little talk with you also?" And they approached and began the conversation. <p>A wise one from among those at the wedding said, "Do you understand the significance of what you have seen?" <p>They replied, "Somewhat" And then they asked him why the bridegroom, now the husband, was so clothed; and he answered, "The bridegroom, now the husband, represented the Lord; and the bride, now his wife, represented the church; because marriages in heaven represent the marriage of the Lord with the church. This is why the bridegroom had a miter on his head, and was dressed in a robe, coat, and ephod, like Aaron; and the bride, now the wife, had a crown on her head, and was dressed in a cloak like a queen; but tomorrow they will be clothed differently, because this representation only lasts during today."
</p>
<p>
[2] Again they asked, "As he represented the Lord, and she the church, why did she sit at his right?" <p>The wise one replied, "Because there are two things that constitute the marriage of the Lord and the church, love and wisdom, and the Lord is love and the church is wisdom; and wisdom is at the right of love because the man of the church is wise as if of himself, and as he becomes wise, he receives love from the Lord. Furthermore, the right hand signifies power, and love has power through wisdom. But as before said, after marriage the representation is changed, the husband then representing wisdom, and the wife the love of his wisdom. This, however, is not the prior love, but a secondary love, which the wife has from the Lord through the wisdom of the husband. Love of the Lord, which is the prior love, is in the husband the love of being wise; therefore after marriage the two, husband and wife together, represent the church."
</p>
<p>
[3] Again they asked, "Why did not you men stand beside the bridegroom, now the husband, while the six virgins stood beside the bride, now the wife?" <p>The wise one replied, "Because today we ourselves are counted among the virgins, and the number six signifies all, and what is complete." <p>But they said, "What does that mean?" <p>He replied, "Virgins signify the church, and the church is of both sexes; therefore in relation to the church we, too, are virgins; as is evident from the following in the Apocalypse: <p>These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth (<a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>). <p>And because 'virgins' signify the church, the Lord compared the church, <p>To ten virgins invited to a wedding (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>); <p>and because Israel, Zion, and Jerusalem, signify the church, the virgin and daughter of Israel, Zion and Jerusalem, are so frequently mentioned in the Word. And again, the Lord describes His marriage with the church in these words in David: <p>On thy right hand doth stand the queen in the best gold of Ophir; her clothing is inwrought with gold; she shall be led unto the king in broidered work; the virgins that follow her, her companions, shall enter into the king's palace (<a href="3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9-15</a>)."
</p>
<p>
[4] Finally they asked, "Is it not proper that some priest should be present and minister in these matters?" <p>The wise one answered, "This is proper on earth, but not in the heavens because of the representation of the Lord Himself and the church. On earth this is not known. Nevertheless, with us a priest ministers at betrothals, and hears, receives, confirms, and consecrates the consent. Consent is the essential of marriage, and the things that follow are its formalities." </p>

<p>
748. The conducting angel afterwards talked with the wedding guests about his companions, saying that he had introduced them by command, and had showed the magnificent things in the palace of the prince, and the wonders there; that they had dined with the prince, and had afterwards conversed with their wise men. He then asked: "May they be permitted to converse a little with you?" They drew near and entered into conversation. A certain wise man who had been one of the guests said, "Do you understand the signification of what you have seen?" "Not very fully," they replied; and then they asked him: "Why was the bridegroom, now a husband, clothed in that particular manner?" "The bridegroom," he answered, "represented the Lord, and the bride, now a wife, represented the Church. That is why the bridegroom had a mitre on his head, and wore a tunic and an ephod, like Aaron; and why the bride, now a wife, had a crown on her head, and wore a mantle, like a queen; but to-morrow they will be dressed differently, because this representation lasts only to-day."</p>
<p>
[2] "Since he represented the Lord, and she the Church, why," they asked, "did she sit at his right hand?" "There are two things," he replied, "which constitute the marriage of the Lord and the Church, namely, love and wisdom. The Lord is love, and the Church is wisdom, and wisdom is at the right hand of love. For the man of the Church is wise as of himself, and in proportion to his wisdom he receives love from the Lord. The right hand also signifies power, and love has power by means of wisdom; but after the wedding, as was just stated, the representation is changed, for then the husband represents wisdom, and the wife, the love of his wisdom. This, however, is not the prior love but a secondary love; for the wife has it from the Lord, through the wisdom of the husband. The love of the Lord, which is the prior love, is the love of being wise; and this abides with the husband; therefore, after the wedding, both together, the husband and his wife, represent the Church."</p>
<p>
[3] They asked again: "Why did you men not stand by the side of the bridegroom, now the husband, as the six maidens stood by the side of the bride, now the wife?" He answered: "Because we to-day are numbered among the maidens, and the number six signifies all, and what is complete." But they said, "How is that?" "Maidens," he replied, "signify the Church, and the Church consists of both sexes." Therefore, we also, with reference to the Church, are maidens. That this is so, is evident from these words in the Revelation:<p>"These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth," <a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>;<p>and because virgins signify the Church, therefore the Lord compared it to:<p>"Ten virgins invited to the marriage," <a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, and following verses;<p>and because the Church is signified by Israel, Zion and Jerusalem, mention is so often made in the Word of the "virgin and daughter of Israel, of Zion and of Jerusalem." The Lord also describes His marriage with the Church by these words in David: <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
<p>"Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in (rich) gold of Ophir... her clothing is of wrought gold. She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her... shall enter into the king's palace" <a href="3927/psalms_45_9.htm">Psalms 45:9-15</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] "Is it not fitting," they afterwards asked, "that a priest should be present and minister at the wedding?" "This is fitting on earth," he answered, "but not in the heavens, because of the representation of the Lord Himself and the Church; on earth men are not aware of this; and yet with us a priest ministers at the betrothal, and hears, receives, confirms and consecrates the consent. Consent is the essential of marriage, and all succeeding ceremonies are its formalities."<p>

[2] Quaesiverunt iterum, quia Ille repraesentavit Dominum, et Illa Ecclesiam, cur Illa ad dextram Ejus sedit; respondit sapiens, quia duo sunt, quae faciunt Conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae, Amor et Sapientia, ac Dominus est Amor, et Ecclesia est Sapientia, et Sapientia ad dextram amoris est, sapit enim homo Ecclesiae sicut a se, et sicut sapit, recipit amorem a Domino; dextra etiam significat potentiam, et potentia amori est per sapientiam: sed ut dictum est, post nuptias mutatur repraesentatio, nam tunc Maritus repraesentat Sapientiam, et uxor sapientiae ejus Amorem, verum hic Amor non est amor prior, sed est amor secundarius, qui est a Domino uxori per sapientiam mariti; amor Domini, qui est amor prior, est amor sapiendi apud maritum, quare post nuptias ambo simul, maritus et ejus uxor, repraesentant Ecclesiam.</p>
<p>
[3] Quaesiverunt denuo, cur non vos Viri stetistis ad latus Sponsi nunc Mariti, sicut sex Virgines steterunt ad latus Sponsae nunc Uxoris; respondit sapiens, causa est, quia nos hodie numeramur inter virgines, ac numerus sex significat omnes et completum; at dixerunt, quid hoc; respondit, Virgines significant Ecclesiam, et Ecclesia est ex utroque sexu, quare etiam nos quoad Ecclesiam sumus Virgines; quod ita sit, constat ex his in Apocalypsi, "Hi sunt, qui cum mulieribus non inquinati sunt, VIRGINES enim sunt, et sequuntur Agnum quocunque vadit," Cap. <a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">14:4</a>.
