752. After they expressed their gratitude to the preacher, they went back to their rooms. There the angel said to them, "Today is the third day since you came up into this community of heaven. You were prepared by the Lord to be able to be here for three days. Therefore the time has come for us to part. Take off the clothes that were sent to you by the prince, and put on your own clothes. "
<p>When the newcomers were back in their own clothes, they were inspired with a strong desire to leave; so they left and went back down. The angel came with them all the way to the place of the original meeting. There they humbly gave thanks to the Lord for blessing them with knowledge and understanding concerning heavenly joys and eternal happiness. </p>

So now it is time for us to part. Take off the clothes the prince sent you, and put on your own.' When they were dressed in their own clothes, they felt a desire to leave. So they left and went down, with the angel accompanying them as far as the place of assembly. There they gave thanks to the Lord for His goodness in blessing them with knowledge, and so with intelligence, about the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness. </p>

And as soon as they had put on their own clothes they were inspired with a desire to depart; so they departed and descended, the angel accompanying them all the way to the place of the assembly; and there they gave thanks to the Lord for having vouchsafed to bless them with knowledge and consequent intelligence respecting heavenly joys and eternal happiness. </p>
