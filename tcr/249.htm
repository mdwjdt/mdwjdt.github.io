<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>249</b>.之所以说圣言的每一个细节里面都有一个主与教会、因而良善与真理的婚姻，是因为哪里有一个主与教会的婚姻，哪里就有一个良善与真理的婚姻，后者来自前者。只要教会，或教会中人拥有真理，主会以良善作用其真理，使它们活过来。或也可说，只要教会中人能理解真理，主就会通过仁之善作用于他的理解力，从而将生命浇灌到其理解力中。每个人里面都有两个生命官能，即所谓的理解力和意愿。理解力是真理、因而智慧的容器，而意愿则是良善、因而仁爱的容器。为使人成为教会中人，这两个官能必须合而为一。当人表面上貌似凭自己通过纯正真理形成自己的理解力，并且他的意愿被主充满爱的良善时，它们就合而为一了。因此，人既有一个真理的生命，也有一个良善的生命；真理的生命在于他的理解力，良善的生命在于他的意愿。当这两个生命成为一体时，它们就构成一个生命，而非两个生命。这就是主与教会的婚姻，也是人里面良善与真理的婚姻。</p>

249. 在聖言細節之中, 因為有主與教會的結合, 會帶來良善與真理的結合, 這是因為何處有主與教會的結合, 那裡就會有良善與真理的結合, 因為後者來自前者。只要教會或教會之人在真理之中, 主就會將良善注入到他們的真理之中, 使之有生命。或者說, 當教會之人處於對真理的理解之中時, 主會藉著與義相關的良善來作用於他的理解, 因而將生命注入其中。
<p>每個人裡面都有兩種能力——認知和意志。認知是真理的容器,因而是信的容器; 意志是良善的容器,因而是義的容器。這兩個能力必須合為一, 人方可成為教會之人。當人從純正的真理來形成他的認知時(看起來好像是他自己所為), 並且當他的意志被仁之善填充時(由主來成就), 兩者就合為一了。因此, 人就有了真理的生命和良善的生命, 真理的生命在他的認知之中, 良善的生命在他的意志之中。當二者成為一時, 就組成一個生命, 而非兩個生命。這就是主與教會的結合, 也是真理與良善在人裡面的結合。 </p>

249. The heading above states that in the individual details in the Word there is a marriage between the Lord and the church and therefore a marriage between goodness and truth, because wherever there is a marriage between the Lord and the church a marriage between goodness and truth is also present, since the latter marriage comes from the former one.
<p>When a whole church, or just an individual within a church, has truths, the Lord flows into these truths with goodness and brings them to life. To put it another way, when people who are part of a church understand something true, the Lord flows into their intellect and enlivens it by bringing goodwill into it.
<p>We all have two faculties of life called the intellect and the will. Our intellect is a vessel for truth and therefore for wisdom; our will is a vessel for goodness and therefore for goodwill. For us to become part of the church, these two parts of us have to become one. The two parts do in fact become one when we build our intellect with genuine truths (which happens to all appearances as if we were doing the building ourselves) and our will is filled with goodness and love (which is done by the Lord). Then the life of truth and the life of goodness are in us - the life of truth in our intellect and the life of goodness in our will. When these two lives are united, they become one life, not two. This is the marriage between the Lord and the church; it is also the marriage between goodness and truth in us. </p>

249. There is said to be a marriage of the Lord and the church in the details of the Word, and thus a marriage of good and truth, because where there is a marriage of the Lord and the church, there too there is a marriage of good and truth, for the one is the result of the other. So long as a church or its individual members are in possession of truths, the Lord acts upon the truths with good and makes them come alive; or, what is the same thing, so long as a person belonging to the church is able to understand truth, the Lord acts upon his understanding by means of the good of charity and thus pours life into it. Every person has two life-faculties, known as the understanding and the will. The understanding receives truth and hence wisdom; the will receives good and hence charity. These two faculties must act as one for a person to be a true member of the church; and they do so, so long as a person forms his understanding from genuine truths, and this appears to be his own doing, and so long as his will is filled by the good of love, which is the Lord's doing. Hence a person has a life of truth and a life of good, the life of truth in the understanding, the life of good in the will. So long as they are united, they make not two, but one life. This is the marriage of the Lord and the church, or the marriage of good and truth in the case of the individual. </p>

249. There is said to be a marriage of the Lord and the church, and in consequence of good and truth, in every particular of the Word, because where there is a marriage of the Lord and the church there is also a marriage of good and truth, since the latter is from the former. For when the church, that is, the man of the church, is in truths, the Lord flows into his truths with good, and makes them alive; or what is the same thing, when the man of the church is in the understanding of truth the Lord flows into his understanding through the good of charity, and thus pours life into it. In every man there are two faculties of life called the understanding and will. The understanding is the receptacle of truth and thus of wisdom, and the will is the receptacle of good and thus of charity. That man may be a man of the church these two faculties must make one; and they make one when man forms his understanding out of genuine truths, which in appearance is done as if by himself, and when his will is filled with the good of love, which is done by the Lord. In consequence of this, man has both a life of truth and a life of good, a life of truth in his understanding, and a life of good in his will, and when these are made one they constitute one life and not two. This is the marriage of the Lord and the church, and also the marriage of good and truth in man. </p>

249. It is said that in every detail of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and consequently the marriage of good and truth; because where there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church there also is the marriage of good and truth, the latter resulting from the former. For when the Church, or a man of the Church, is principled in truths, the Lord then enters into those truths with good, and makes them live; or what is the same, when a man of the Church is in the understanding of truth, the Lord then enters his understanding through the good of charity, and thus infuses life into it.<p>There are two faculties of life in every man, the understanding and the will, the understanding being the receptacle of truth, and thence of wisdom, the will being the receptacle of good, and thence of charity. These two faculties ought to make one, that a man may be a member of the Church; and they are united when a man forms his understanding from genuine truths, apparently of himself, and when his will is filled with the good of love, which is done by the Lord. In this way a man has the life of truth and the life of good, the life of truth in his understanding and the life of good in his will; and when these are united, they form not two lives but one. This is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and also the marriage of good and truth in man. </p>

249. Dicitur quod in singulis Verbi sit conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae, et inde conjugium boni et veri; quia ubi conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae est, ibi etiam conjugium boni et veri est, est enim hoc conjugium ab illo; nam dum Ecclesia seu homo Ecclesiae in veris est, tunc Dominus in vera ejus influit cum bono, et illa vivificat; seu quod idem, dum homo Ecclesiae in intellectu veri est, tunc Dominus per bonum charitatis in intellectum ejus influit, et sic ei infundit vitam. Sunt binae Facultates vitae apud unumquemvis hominem, quae Vocantur Intellectus et Voluntas; Intellectus est receptaculum veri, et inde sapientiae, ac voluntas est receptaculum boni, et inde charitatis; hae duae Facultates unum facient, ut homo sit homo Ecclesiae, ac unum faciunt, dum homo Intellectum format ex genuinis veris, et hoc fit ad apparentiam sicut ab illo, et dum Voluntas ejus impletur bono amoris, hoc fit a Domino; inde homini vita veri et vita boni est, vita veri in Intellectu, et vita boni in Voluntate, quae dum unitae sunt, non duas sed unam vitam faciunt. Hoc est Conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae, tum Conjugium boni et veri apud hominem. </p>
