<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>405</b>.然而，如果自我之爱或统治之爱构成头，那么天堂之爱便经由躯体降至两脚。自我之爱越强烈，天堂之爱就越下沉，最终通过脚踝直降至脚底；若继续发展，它就会穿过脚底，被践踏在脚下了。统治之爱分为两种，一种由爱邻产生，另一种由爱己产生。那些由于爱邻而处于统治之爱的人，追求权力是为了为大众和个人履行服务；因此，在天堂，这些人被赋予权力。<br />皇帝、国王和贵族生来就为了执掌大权而被抚养长大，若他们肯在神面前谦卑自己，他们的这种爱有时反而比那些出身卑微，并出于骄傲而比别人更渴望优越地位之人的更少一些。然而，对于那些出于自我之爱而处于统治之爱的人来说，天堂之爱就象他们为取悦百姓而踩于其上的脚凳。若百姓看不到，他们就把它扔到一个角落，或扔到门外。这是因为，他们只爱自己，因此将其意愿和心智的思维浸没于自我中心，而自我中心本身是遗传的邪恶，这恶与天堂之爱截然对立。<br />困扰那些由于自我之爱而喜欢统治之人的罪恶，总的来说有以下这些：蔑视他人，嫉妒，对异己者不友善，由此产生的敌意，仇恨，报复，无情、凶狠和残忍。哪里盛行这类邪恶，哪里就有对神、对神性事物，即教会的真理与良善的藐视；即便他们尊重这些，也只是挂在嘴上，以免他们受到神职人员的攻击和其他人的谴责。<br />不过。这爱在神职人员身上是一种情形，在平信徒身上又是另一种情形。对神职人员而言，若放任自流，它会向上爬升，直到他们想成为神明；但对平信徒而言，他们最终想成为国王，甚至到了这爱的幻觉将他们的心思带走的地步。<br />就相对完善之人而言，天堂之爱占据至高位置，可以说构成接下来的一切爱的头；尘世之爱在它下面，可以说构成头下面的胸；自我之爱则更向下，处于两脚的位置。既如此，那么若自我之爱构成了头，这人就会彻底颠倒。这时，在天人看来，他仿佛头垂向地面、背部弓向天而躺着。当进行敬拜时，他看似舞动手脚，如同豹崽。而且，这类人会显为各种动物的形状，并且长着两个头，一个在上面，有一张兽脸，另一个在下面，有一张人脸，上面的头不断把他们摁下去，迫使他们亲吻地面。所有这些人都是感官人，就是诸如上面所描述的那类人（402节）。</p>

<p>
405. 然而, 如果愛自己或愛控制他人(愛權力)構成頭部, 那麼愛天國便從身體排擠到腿腳。愛自己的程度越深, 愛天國就越沉降到腳踝之下直至腳趾; 若再繼續發展, 就穿過鞋底, 被踐踏在腳下了。
<p>愛控制他人(或愛權力)有兩種, 一種產生於愛鄰舍, 另一種產生愛自己。 那些源自於愛鄰舍而愛權力之人, 追求權力的目標在於利益公眾和其他人; 在天國中, 權力也被賦予這樣的人們。[2]君主,國王與將軍生來被提升到領袖之位, 若他們謙遜在上帝面前, 他們有時比出身低賤的人們更少地愛自己, 那些人出於驕傲比其他人更渴求高地位。
<p>另一方面, 那些出於愛自己而熱愛權力者(或控制他人), 視愛天國為腳凳。在人群面前, 他們將腳踩在腳凳之上; 若人群看不見, 他們便將腳凳扔進角落或扔出門外。為什麼如此？因為他們只愛他們自己。因此, 將他們的意志與想法投向專注自我。專注于自我其實是遺傳的邪惡, 它與天國之愛完全相反。
<p>[3]對那些出於愛自己而熱愛權力者(或控制他人), 總有邪惡纏繞著他們, 總的來說包括:鄙視人,妒忌人,對不利己者的不友好,由此產生的敵意,憎恨,報復,無同情心,凶蠻,殘酷。哪裡有如此之惡, 哪裡就有對上帝或屬於上帝的事物(與教會相關的各種真理和良善)的藐視。即使他們尊重這些, 也只是停留在嘴上, 以防他們的名聲受神職人員的攻擊, 以及受到其它任何人的傷害。
<p>[4]對於這種愛, 在神職人員與平信徒之間有所差別。對神職人員而言, 倘若這樣的愛從約束中被解放, 會膨脹到想要成為上帝。然而對平信徒而言, 他們想成為君王。這樣的愛能將他們思想的幻象帶到如此遙遠的地步。
<p>[5]對於靈性生命良性成長的人們而言, 愛天國佔據最高的位置(可以說, 構成頭部), 其它的愛往下接續。愛世界在愛天國之下, 可以說, 構成頭部之下的胸腹部。愛自己再往下, 構成腿腳部位。可以得知, 如果愛自己構成頭部, 人就會完全變得完全顛倒。在天人們的眼裡, 這樣的人如同頭朝下躺著, 背弓向天。當這樣的人在敬拜時, 他們看起來好像豹崽那樣四肢朝下在地上嬉戲。此外, 這類人看起來還像各種兩頭的動物——上面的頭長著動物的臉, 下面的頭長著人臉, 被上面的頭不停地往下摁,被強迫去親吻地面。
<p>所有這類人都是感官導向之人, 就像上面<a href="402.htm">402</a>節所述之人。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
405. If, however, love for ourselves or love of power constitutes the head, then love for heaven goes down the body to the lower legs. The more this love grows, the more love for heaven moves through the ankles into the feet. If love for ourselves grows even more, love for heaven passes through the shoes and is trampled.
<p>There is a love for power that comes from loving our neighbor and a love for power that comes from loving ourselves. People who have a love for power that comes from loving their neighbor are ambitious for power for the purpose of benefiting both the general public and individual citizens. In the heavens, in fact, power is entrusted to people like this.
</p>
<p>
[2] If emperors, monarchs, and generals who were born and raised to be leaders humble themselves before God, they sometimes have less self-love than people who come from a lowly family and whose pride makes them long for superior status over others.
<p>On the other hand, people who have a love for power that comes from loving themselves use love for heaven as their footstool. They put their feet on it in view of the crowd. If there is no crowd in sight, they either toss it in the corner or throw it out the door. Why? Because they love only themselves. As a result, they plunge the willing and thinking of their minds into self-absorption. Self-absorption is in fact a hereditary evil; it is the polar opposite of love for heaven.
</p>
<p>
[3] If we have a love for power that comes from loving ourselves, we also have evils that accompany that love. They are generally the following: despising others, jealousy, viewing people as our enemies if they do not show us special favor, hostility, hatred, vengefulness, mercilessness, savagery, and cruelty. Despising God is another such evil, as is despising the divine things that are the true insights and good actions taught by the church. If we give these things any honor, we only pay them lip service to prevent the church hierarchy from attacking our reputation and to stave off verbal abuse from everyone else.
</p>
<p>
[4] Love for power is different for the clergy than it is for the laity. In the clergy this love surges upward, as long as it is given the reins, until they want to be gods. Lay people, on the other hand, want to be monarchs. That is how far the imagination of that love takes their minds.
</p>
<p>
[5] In spiritually well-developed people, love for heaven occupies the highest place and constitutes the head of what follows it; love for the world is beneath it and is like the torso below the head; love for themselves is below this love in the role of the lower legs. It follows then that if love for ourselves constitutes the head, we are completely upside-down. In that case we look to the angels like people sleeping with their heads on the ground and their rear ends up in the air. When people like this are worshiping, they look as if they are frolicking on all fours like panther cubs. Furthermore, they look like various kinds of two-headed creatures - the head on top has the face of a wild animal, while the other below it has a human face that is continually pushed down from above and forced to kiss the ground.
<p>All people of this type are sense-oriented. They are like the people described above in 402. </p>

405. However, if self-love or the love of controlling others makes up the head, then the love of heaven passes through the body to the feet. The more self-love increases, the more the love of heaven sinks through the ankles to the soles of the feet; and if it goes on increasing, it passes through the shoes and is trampled underfoot. The love of controlling others is of two kinds, that resulting from love of the neighbour and that resulting from self-love. Those who are set on the love of controlling others as the result of love of the neighbour seek power in order to perform services to the public and to individuals; these therefore have power entrusted to them in the heavens.</p>
<p>
[2] Emperors, kings and dukes, who were born and brought up to positions of power, if they humble themselves before God, are sometimes less set on the love of power than those of lowly origin, who from pride seek high rank more than others. But those who are set on the love of controlling others as the result of self-love treat the love of heaven like a foot-stool; for the sake of the common people they rest their feet upon it, but, when the common people are not to be seen, throw it into a corner or out of doors. The reason is that they love only themselves, and therefore plunge their wills and the thoughts of their minds in the self (proprium), which regarded in itself is hereditary evil; and this is diametrically opposed to the love of heaven.</p>
<p>
[3] The evils which beset those who love to control others as the result of self-love are generally speaking the following: contempt for others, envy, unfriendliness directed against those who do not show them favour, hostility resulting from this, hatred, the taking of revenge, pitilessness, ferocity and cruelty. Where such evils exist, there too are found contempt for God and what is God's, that is, the various kinds of truth and good which belong to the church. If they respect these, it is only with the lips, to prevent their reputations being attacked by the clergy and abused by everyone else.</p>
<p>
[4] But there is a difference in this love between the clergy and laymen. In the case of the clergy, if this love is freed from restraint, it rises so high they want to become gods; but in the case of laymen, they want to become kings. That is the height to which the fantasising caused by that love carries away their minds.</p>
<p>
[5] In the case of the perfect person, the love of heaven occupies the highest position and, so to speak, forms the head of all the loves that follow; the love of the world is below it and is, so to speak, the chest beneath the head; and self-love is below this in the position of the feet. This being so, if self-love made up the head, the person would be turned completely upside down. He would then appear to the angels as if lying with his head bowed down to the ground and with his back to the sky. While engaged in worship, he would seem as if dancing on his hands and feet, like a panther cub. Moreover such people might appear in the shape of various animals with two heads, one above with the face of a wild animal, the other below with a human face, constantly pushed down by the upper one and forced to kiss the ground. All these people are sensual men, and such as have been described above in 402. </p>

405. But when love of self or love of ruling constitutes the head, the love of heaven passes down through the body to the feet; and as that love increases, the love of heaven descends through the ankles to the soles, and if it increases still further, it passes to the heels and is trodden upon. There is a love of ruling arising from love of the neighbor, and a love of ruling arising from love of self. Those who are in the love of ruling from love of the neighbor seek dominion to the end that they may perform uses to the public and to individuals; and to such, therefore, dominion is entrusted in the heavens.
</p>
<p>
[2] Emperors, kings, and noblemen, who have been born and brought up to positions of authority, if they humble themselves before God, are sometimes less in that love than those who are of humble origin and who from pride are more eager than others for places of pre-eminence. But to those who are in the love of ruling from love of self, the love of heaven is like a bench on which, to please the people, they place their feet, but which, when the people are out of sight, they toss into a corner or out of doors. This is because they love themselves alone, and consequently immerse their wills and the thoughts of their minds in what is their own [proprium], which viewed in itself is inherited evil, and this evil is diametrically opposed to the love of heaven.
</p>
<p>
[3] The evils of those who are in the love of rule from love of self, are in general as follows: Contempt of others, envy, <sup "fn11_1">1</sup>
enmity against those who do not favor them; consequently hostility, hatred, revenge, unmercifulness, ferocity, and cruelty; and where such evils prevail, there is also contempt of God and of Divine things, which are the truths and goods of the church; or if they honor these it is with the lips only, lest they should be denounced by the church authorities and censured by others.
</p>
<p>
[4] But this love is one thing with the clergy and another with the laity. With the clergy it climbs upward, when the reins are given to it, even until they wish to be gods; but with the laity until they wish to be kings; to such an extent do the hallucinations of that love carry their minds away.
</p>
<p>
[5] Since in the perfect man the love of heaven holds the highest place, and forms, as it were, the head of all that follows from it, the love of the world being beneath it like the chest beneath the head, and the love of self beneath this like the feet, it follows, that if love of self were to form the head, the man would be completely inverted. He would then appear to the angels like one lying bent over, with his head to the ground and his back toward heaven; and when worshiping, he would appear to be frolicking on his hands and feet like a panther's cub. Furthermore, such men would appear under the forms of various beasts with two heads, one head above having the face of a wild animal, and the other below having a human face, which would be constantly thrust forward by the upper one and compelled to kiss the earth. All these are sensual men, and are such as were described above (n. <a href="402.htm">402</a>). <p>

405. If, however, the love of self, or the love of ruling, is the head, then the love of heaven passes through the body to the feet. As the love of self increases, the love of heaven descends through the ankles to the soles of the feet; and if it increases still further, the love of heaven passes through the shoes and is trampled under foot. There is a love of ruling arising from the love of the neighbor, and there is a love of ruling from the love of self. Those who are in the former love seek dominion for the purpose of promoting public and private uses; to these, therefore, authority is also entrusted in the heavens.</p>
<p>
[2] Emperors, kings and dukes, who are born and educated to rule, if they humble themselves before God, are sometimes less influenced by the self-seeking love of rule than those of low origin who seek pre-eminence from pride. Those who are in the love of ruling from the love of self treat the love of heaven as a sort of foot-stool, on which they rest their feet to impress the common people. When, however, they are not under their observation, they throw it into a corner, or cast it out of doors. The reason of this is that they love themselves alone, and consequently immerse their wills and thoughts in their proprium. This in itself is hereditary evil, and is diametrically opposed to the love of heaven.</p>
<p>
[3] The evils which infest those who are in the love of ruling from the love of self are in general these: contempt of others, envy, enmity against those who show them no favor, and actual hostility for that reason, hatred, revenge, unmercifulness, harshness and cruelty. Where these evils exist there also is contempt of God and of Divine things, namely, the truth and good of the Church. If they should profess respect for these, it is with the lips only, lest they should be denounced by the clergy and censured by all others.</p>
<p>
[4] This love of rule is one thing with the clergy and another with the laity. With the clergy it mounts upward when restraints are removed until they desire to be gods; whilst with the laity it increases until they seek to be kings; to such a degree does the madness of this love affect the mind.</p>
<p>
[5] The love of heaven with the perfect man holds the highest place, and is as it were the head of the loves that follow; and the love of the world is beneath it, like the breast under the head; and the love of self is beneath this again, like the feet. It follows, therefore, that if the love of self were to form the head the man would be completely inverted. He would then appear to angels like a person lying with his head bowed towards the ground and his back towards heaven; and in the act of worship he would appear to be dancing on his hands and feet like a panther's cub. Moreover, such persons would appear in the form of various beasts with two heads, one with the face of a beast, and the other under it with a human face which would be continually thrust forward by the other, and forced to kiss the ground. All these, together with such as have been described above in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, are sensual men. </p>

Si autem Amor sui seu Amor dominandi facit caput, tunc Amor Coeli transit per corpus ad pedes; et ille Amor, quantum increscit, tantum descendit Amor Coeli per talos ad plantas, et si adhuc increscit, transit calceos et proculcatur.
