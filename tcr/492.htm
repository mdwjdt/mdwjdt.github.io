492. 我将这则记事添加到前文。 有好几次, 我听见仁之善的言论从天降下, 穿过精灵界, 渗入地狱, 甚至直达深处。 在这过程中, 原本良善的言论被转为诸如与仁之善截然对立之类的, 最终成为憎恨邻舍的言论。 这个迹象表明, 从主发出的一切都是好的, 但它被地狱灵转化为恶。 某些信之真理也是如此, 在下降的过程中被转化为与真理相对的虚假。 因为正是接受形式本身将进入它里面的一切转化为与自己一致之物。 </p>

492. To these points I will add the following memorable occurrence.
<p>Several times I have heard words issuing forth from heaven about the good actions that come from goodwill. These words passed through the world of spirits and penetrated into hell, even to its greatest depth. Step by step the words turned into words that are directly opposed to the good actions that come from goodwill, and finally became expressions of hatred against the neighbor. This is an indication that everything that emanates from the Lord is good. It is the spirits in hell who turn that emanation into evil. A similar thing happened with some truths related to faith. As they went along they were turned into falsities opposed to those truths. The receiving form turns what is flowing in into something that harmonizes with itself. </p>

492. I shall add to this the following account of an experience.<p>I have on several occasions heard sayings about the good of charity coming down from heaven, passing through the world of spirits, and penetrating right to the depths of hell. As these sayings descended, they were turned into ideas obviously contrary to the good of charity, and finally into ones full of hatred directed against the neighbour. This was an indication that everything coming from the Lord is good, but is turned into evil by the spirits in hell. The same happened with some truths of faith, which in their descent turned into falsities which were the opposite of the truths. It is the receiving form which turns what impinges on it into what agrees with itself. </p>

492. To the foregoing I add this Memorable Relation: <p>Several times I have heard expressions respecting good of charity made to descend from heaven, which passed through the world of spirits and penetrated into hell, even to its depths; and in their progress these expressions were turned into such as were directly contrary to good of charity, and finally into expressions of hatred of the neighbor; a sign that everything that goes forth from the Lord is good, and that it is turned into evil by the spirits in hell. The same was done with certain truths of faith, which in their progress were turned into the opposite falsities. For it is the recipient form itself that turns whatever enters into it into what is in accord with itself. </p>

492. MEMORABILIA.<p>To the above I will here add the following experience. I have several times heard expressions from heaven concerning the good of charity. These passed through the world of spirits and penetrated to the depths of hell. In their progress they were changed into such as were entirely opposed to the good of charity, and at length into such as breathed hatred against the neighbor. This is proof that whatever proceeds from the Lord is good, and that it is turned into evil by spirits in hell. The same was done with some truths of faith, which in their progress were changed into the opposite falsities; for the recipient form turns whatever enters into it into something in agreement with itself. </p>

492. His adjiciam hoc Memorabile; aliquoties audivi e Coelo demissas voces de bono charitatis, quae pertransibant Mundum Spirituum, et penetrabant in infernum usque ad profundum ejus, et quod illae voces in progressione verterentur in talia, quae plane opposita erant bono charitatis, et tandem in illa quae odii contra proximum erant; indicium, quod omne quod a Domino procedit sit bonum, et quod a spiritibus in inferno vertatur in malum. Simile factum est cum aliquibus veris fidei, quae in procedendo vertebantur in falsa veris opposita: ipsa enim forma recipiens vertit incidentia in tale quod sibi concordat. </p>
