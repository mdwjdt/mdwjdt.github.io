831. 伊斯兰教徒对基督徒心怀敌意的主要原因是, 基督徒信仰三个神性位格, 从而敬拜三个神和三个创造主。 对罗马天主教徒的敌意更深, 因为他们向图像屈膝。 由于这个原因, 他们称天主教徒为崇拜偶像者, 称基督徒为狂热分子, 说他们制造了三个头的神, 还说他们大声说一个, 小声说三个。 他们指责基督徒将全能分裂成了三个, 而不是承认一个神的一个全能。 因此说他们就象三角羊, 一个角对着一个神, 同时三个角对着一个神, 这就是他们在讲坛上担负的祷告, 赞美和布道。 </p>

831. The main reason why Muslims are averse to Christians is that Christians believe in three divine Persons and therefore worship three gods, three creators. Muslims especially dislike Roman Catholics because they bow down before statues. Muslims call Catholics idolaters and call Protestants religious fanatics. They criticize Christians for creating a three-headed God and for saying "one" out loud but mumbling "three" under their breath. They accuse Christians of splitting omnipotence and making three powers out of and from the one power. Muslims compare Christians to animals with three horns, one for each god. Christians, they say, substitute three gods for one in their prayers, their liturgical music, and their sermons. </p>

831. The Mohammedans' hostility to the Christians is primarily due to the Christians' belief in three Divine Persons, leading to the worship of three Gods and three Creators; and with the Roman Catholics as well because of the way they bend the knee before images. Indeed they call the Catholics idolaters, and other Christians they call fanatics, saying that they make God three-headed, saying one but muttering three. Consequently they accuse them of splitting omnipotence into three, instead of acknowledging the single omnipotence of the one God. This, they say, makes them like fauns with three horns, one for each God, and with three together for the one God. This, they say, is the burden of their prayers, their hymns and the sermons from their pulpits. </p>

831. The Mohammedans are hostile to the Christians mainly because of the Christian belief in three Divine persons and the consequent worship of three Gods, and as many Creators; and still more hostile to the Roman Catholics, because of their bending the knee before images; and for this reason they call them idolaters; and the former they call fanatics, declaring that they make God a three-headed being, also that they say one and mutter three, and consequently divide up omnipotence, and from one and of one make three; therefore they are like fauns with three horns, one for each God, and at the same time three for one; and so they pray, so they sing, and so they harangue from their pulpits. </p>

831. The hostility of the Mohammedans to Christians arises chiefly on account of the Christians' belief in three Divine Persons, and their consequent worship of three gods as so many creators; and they have this further charge against Roman Catholics that they bend the knee to images. Hence they call Roman Catholics idolaters, and the other Christians fanatics. They say that they set up a three-headed god, talking of one but muttering about three; and consequently they divide omnipotence, and make three out of one. Thus the Godhead is like a faun with three horns, one for each god and at the same time three for one; and accordingly they fashion their prayers, compose their hymns and preach their sermons from the pulpit. </p>
