<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第5节 若没有属灵事物上的选择自由，圣言毫无用处，结果教会也是</h4><br />483.整个基督教界都知道，广义上说，圣言意味着律法或一部律法书，人必须照此生活才能获得永生。人当离恶行善，当信神而非偶像，在圣言中，还有比这一教导提及得更频繁的事吗？圣言充满了关于这些事的命令和告诫，凡这样行的就有祝福和应许，凡不这样行的就受诅咒和威胁。如果人在属灵的事上，也就是关乎得救和永生之类的事上没有选择自由，这一切又何必呢？岂不是毫无意义，一点用处没有？如果一个人真的执着于这样的观念，认为人在属灵事物上没有任何权力和自由，以致于他在属灵事上没有任何意愿的能力，那么圣言对他而言，不就是一张无字的白纸吗？或象上面放着空墨水瓶的一张白纸，又或象只字未有、因此如同一片空白的点点画画？<br />尽管没有必要通过圣言证实这一点，但由于当今教会在有关属灵的事上已陷入精神错乱，并抽取某些经文支持他们的错解，所以，我只好引用其它经文，这些经文告诫人们当如何行事和信靠。经文如下：<br />神的国要从你们夺去，赐给那结果子的百姓。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.43.htm">马太福音21:43</a>）<br />结出与悔改相称的果子。现在斧头已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树就砍下来，丢在火里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.8.htm">路加福音3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.9.htm">9</a>）<br />耶稣说：“你们为什么称这‘主啊，主啊’却不遵我的话行呢？凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，就像一个人把房子建在磐石上。但那听见而不遵行的，就像一个人在土地上盖房子，没有根基”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.46.htm">路加福音6:46</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.49.htm">49</a>）耶稣说：“听了神之道而遵行的人，就是我的母亲，我的弟兄”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">路加福音8:21</a>）<br />我们知道神不听罪人。惟有敬奉神，遵行他旨意的，神才听他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.31.htm">约翰福音9:31</a>）<br />你们既知道这事，若是去行就有福了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.17.htm">约翰福音13:17</a>）<br />有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的；我也要爱他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">约翰福音14:21</a>）<br />你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.8.htm">约翰福音15:8</a>）<br />你们若遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。我拣选了你们，并且分派你们去结果子，叫你们的果子常存。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.14.htm">约翰福音15:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.16.htm">16</a>）<br />树好，果子也好，看果子，就可以知道树。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.33.htm">马太福音12:33</a>）<br />你们要结出果子来，与悔改的心相称。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">马太福音13:23</a>）<br />撒在好地上的，就是人听道明白了，后来结实。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">马太福音13:23</a>）<br />收割的人得工价，积蓄五谷到永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.36.htm">约翰福音4:36</a>）<br />你们要洗濯，自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行，学习行善。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.16.htm">以赛亚书1:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.17.htm">17</a>）<br />人子要在他父的荣耀里，同着众使者降临。那时候，他要照各人的行为报应各人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">马太福音16:27</a>）<br />行善的复活得生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.29.htm">约翰福音5:29</a>）<br />作工的果效也随着他们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.13.htm">启示录14:13</a>）<br />看哪，我必快来。赏罚在我，要照各人所行的报应他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">启示录22:12</a>）耶和华注目观看世人一切的举动，为要照各人所行的和他作事的结果报应他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.19.htm">耶利米书32:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.6.htm">撒迦利亚书1:6</a>）<br />主还通过寓言教导这样的事，其中很多暗示，行善者将被接纳，而作恶者则被丢弃，如葡萄园工人的寓言（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.33.htm">马太福音21:33</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.44.htm">44</a>）。关于贸易的天赋和资财的寓言（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.14.htm">马太福音25:14</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.13.htm">路加福音19:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.25.htm">25</a>）。<br />以及有关信的：<br />耶稣说，信我的人，必复活；凡活着信我的，必永远不死。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">约翰福音11:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.26.htm">26</a>）<br />我父的意思，是叫一切见子而信的人得永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.40.htm">约翰福音6:40</a>）<br />信子的人有永生。不信子的人不得见永生，神的震怒常在他身上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">约翰福音3:36</a>）<br />神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">约翰福音3:16</a>）<br />还有：<br />耶稣对他说，你要尽心，尽性，尽意，爱主你的神。这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。其次也相仿，就是要爱人如己。这两条诫命，是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">马太福音22:37</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">40</a>）<br />上述经文只是类似经文中的极少部分，如同从大海中舀出的几杯水。</p>

483. If We Had No Free Choice in Spiritual Matters, the Word Would Be Useless and Therefore the Church Would Be Nothing
<p>It is recognized throughout the Christian world that broadly speaking the Word is the law, or the book of the laws we must live by in order to be blessed with eternal life. Surely, the statements in the Word to the effect that we should do good and not evil and should believe in God and not idols occur more often than any others. The Word is full of commandments and exhortations of this kind, with blessings and promises of reward for those who follow them and curses and threats against those who do not. What would be the purpose of all these statements if we had no free choice in spiritual matters, that is, in areas that concern salvation and eternal life? They would be empty statements that serve no use. If we held fast to the idea that we have no power and no freedom in spiritual things, and thus were removed from any power of will in that respect, Sacred Scripture would seem to us like a blank piece of paper with no letters on it, or a sheet of paper on which a whole pot of ink had been spilled, or just serifs and dots without letters - a volume entirely without meaning.
</p>
<p>
[2] There should be no need to confirm this from the Word; but the church of today has plunged into mindless folly in regard to spiritual matters and has cited a number of passages from the Word in support of its view (although the passages have been interpreted falsely). Therefore I feel obligated to quote some passages that command us to do and believe. They are the following.
<p>The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of it. (<a href="3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>)
<p>Produce fruits worthy of repentance. The axe is already lying against the root of the tree. Every tree, then, that does not produce good fruit is being cut down and thrown into the fire. (<a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord' and yet you do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them is like someone who has built a house on the rock; but those who hear and do not do are like someone who has built a house on the ground without a foundation. " (<a href="3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "My mother and siblings are those who hear the Word of God and do it. " (<a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>)
<p>We know that God does not hear sinners, but if people worship God and do his will, them he hears. (<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>)
<p>If you know these things, you are happy if you do them. (<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>)
<p>Those who have my commandments and do them are the ones who love me, and I will love them. (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>)
<p>In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit. (<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>)
<p>You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. I have chosen you so that you will bear fruit and your fruit will remain. (<a href="3927/john_15_14.htm">John 15:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_16.htm">16</a>)
<p>Make the tree good. A tree is recognized by its fruit. (<a href="3927/matthew_12_33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>)
<p>Produce fruits worthy of repentance. (<a href="3927/matthew_3_8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>)
<p>The one sown in good ground is one who hears the Word and bears fruit. (<a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>)
<p>Those who are reaping a harvest receive their reward and gather fruit for eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_4_36.htm">John 4:36</a>)
<p>Wash yourselves; purify yourselves. Remove the evil of your doings; learn to do good. (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>)
<p>The Son of Humankind will come in the glory of his Father, and then he will render to all according to their deeds. (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)
<p>Those who have done good things will depart into a resurrection of life. (<a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>; )
<p>Behold, I am coming quickly and my reward is with me, so that I will give to all according to their work. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>)
<p>Jehovah, whose eyes are opened in order to give to all according to their ways. He treats us according to our works. ([<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>;] <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] The Lord also teaches the same thing in his parables, many of which involve the theme that those who do good things will be accepted and those who do evil things will be rejected. For example, the parable of the vinedressers in the vineyard (<a href="3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33-44</a>); and the parable of the talents and minas, with which people traded (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-27</a>).
<p>Likewise about faith Jesus said, "Those who believe in me will not die to eternity" but will live (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). "This is the will of the Father, that everyone who believes in the Son has eternal life" (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>). "Those who believe in the Son have eternal life, but those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead God's wrath remains upon them" (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son so that everyone who believes in him would not perish but would have eternal life" (<a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>). And further, "You are to love the Lord your God with your whole heart and your whole soul and your whole mind. And you are to love your neighbor as yourself. The Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments" (<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). But these are only a handful of passages from the Word, like a few cups of water from an ocean. </p>

<p>
483. V. Without free will in spiritual matters the Word would not be of any use, nor in consequence would the church be.<p>It is well known throughout the Christian world that the Word is, broadly speaking, the Law, that is, a book of laws in accordance with which a person must live, in order to be granted everlasting life. Is there anything it says more often than that man must do good and not evil, and he must believe in God and not in idols? The Word is also full of commands and exhortations to these actions, with blessings and promises of rewards for those who do so, and curses and threats of punishment for those who do not. Unless man had free will in spiritual matters, that is, in matters concerned with salvation and everlasting life, what would all this be but empty words serving no use? And if anyone were to cling to the idea that he lacked any power or freedom in spiritual matters, so that he was without any will-power in these matters, would not Holy Scripture look to him like a blank piece of paper with no letters on it, or like a piece of paper over which a whole pot of ink had been emptied, or just serifs and dots with no letters, that is to say, a book with nothing in it?</p>
<p>
[2] There would hardly be any need to prove this from the Word, but since present-day churches have plunged so deeply into mental inanity in spiritual matters, citing certain passages in support which they have wrongly interpreted, I am obliged to quote some passages which tell men how to act and believe. These are:<p>The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that produces its fruits, <a href="3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>.<p>Produce fruit worthy of repentance; at any moment now the axe is put to the root of the tree. So every tree which does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire, <a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>.<p>Jesus said, why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and listens to what I say and does that is like a man building a house upon rock. But one who listens and does not do it, is like a man building his house on soil with no foundation, <a href="3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>.<p>Jesus said, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the Word of God and act upon it, <a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>.<p>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone worships God and does His will, He listens to him, <a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>.<p>If you know these things, you are blessed if you act upon them, <a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>.<p>He who possesses my commandments and does them is the one who loves me, and I will love him, <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>.<p>In this is my Father glorified, by your bringing forth much fruit, <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>.<p>You are my friends, if you do whatever I bid you.

[3] The Lord teaches the same lesson in the parables, many of which imply that those who do good are accepted and those who do evil are rejected: as in the parable of the workers in the vineyard (<a href="3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33-44</a>), that of the talents and minas, with which they had to trade (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_13.htm">Luke 19:13-25</a>). Likewise Jesus said about faith:<p>He who believes in me shall never die, but live, <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<p>This is the Father's will, that everyone who believes in the Son should have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; he, however, who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>.<p>Furthermore:<p>You are to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. And you are to love the neighbour as yourself. The law and the prophets depend upon these two commandments, <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>.<p>These are a minute selection from the Word and like a few pints of water drawn from the sea. </p>

483. VI. WITHOUT FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN SPIRITUAL THINGS THE WORD WOULD BE OF NO USE, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE CHURCH WOULD BE NOTHING. <p>It is known throughout the Christian world that in the broadest sense the Word means the law, or the book of the laws, in accordance with which man must live to obtain eternal life. And what is there more frequently taught in it than that man should do good and not evil, and should believe in God and not in idols? And it is full of commands and exhortations to do these things, and of blessings and promises of reward for those who do them, and of curses and threats for those who do not. To what purpose is this, if man has no freedom of choice in spiritual things, that is, in such things as relate to salvation and eternal life? Would it not be void of meaning, and subserve no use? And if man were to cling to the idea that he has no power and no liberty in spiritual things, and thus were to be separated from any power of will in spiritual matters, would the Sacred Scriptures then seem to him to be anything more than a blank sheet without a syllable upon it, or like a sheet upon which a whole inkstand had been emptied, or like mere curves and dots without any letters, therefore like an empty volume?
</p>
<p>
[2] To confirm this from the Word ought not to be necessary, but as the churches of today have poured themselves forth in mental inanities respecting spiritual things, and to confirm these have brought forth passages from the Word which have been falsely interpreted, it may be well to present others which command man to do and to believe. Such are the following: <p>The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof (<a href="3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>). <p>Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. And even now the axe is laid unto the root of the tree; every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire (<a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8, 9</a>). <p>Jesus said, Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say? Everyone who cometh to Me, and heareth My words, and doeth them, is like a man building a house upon a rock. But he that heareth and doeth not, is like unto a man that built a house upon the ground without a foundation (<a href="3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>). <p>Jesus said, My mother and My brethren are those who hear the Word of God and do it (<a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>). <p>We know that God heareth not sinners; but if one worship God, and do His will, him He heareth (<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>). <p>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them (<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>). <p>He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and I will love him (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>). <p>Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit (<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>). <p>Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you; I have chosen you, that ye should bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain (<a href="3927/john_15_14.htm">John 15:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_16.htm">16</a>). <p>Make the tree good, the tree is known by its fruit (<a href="3927/matthew_12_33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>). <p>Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance (<a href="3927/matthew_3_8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). <p>He that is sown upon good ground this is he that heareth the Word, and beareth fruit (<a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>). <p>He that reapeth receiveth reward, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal (<a href="3927/john_4_36.htm">John 4:36</a>). <p>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings; learn to do good (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16, 17</a>). <p>The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father, and then He shall render unto everyone according to his deeds (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>). <p>And shall come forth, they that have done goods, unto the resurrection of life (<a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>). <p>Their works do follow with them (<a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). <p>Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give to every man according to his work (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). <p>Jehovah whose eyes are open to give everyone according to his ways. According to our doings, hath He dealt with us (<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>).
</p>

<p>
[3] The Lord teaches the same in His parables, many of which imply that those who do good will be accepted while those who do evil will be rejected, <p>As in the parable of the workmen in the vineyard (<a href="3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33-44</a>). <p>Of the talents and pounds given to trade with (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-31</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_13.htm">Luke 19:13-25</a>). <p>So also of Faith; Jesus said, <p>Whosoever believeth in Me shall never die, but shall live (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). <p>This is the will of the Father, that everyone who believeth in the Son may have eternal life (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>). <p>He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). <p>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have eternal life (<a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>.) <p>And again: <p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets (<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). <p>But these are only a very few of such passages in the Word, and they are like a few cups of water from the sea. </p>

483. V. WITHOUT FREE WILL IN SPIRITUAL THINGS THERE WOULD BE NO USE FOR THE WORD; AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WOULD BE NO CHURCH.<p>It is well known throughout the Christian world that the Word, in a wide sense, is the law, or book of laws according to which man must live that he may obtain eternal life. In the Word it is very frequently stated that a man should do good and not evil; and that he should believe in God and not in idols. It is also full of injunctions and exhortations to do these things, with blessings and promises of rewards for those who comply, and with curses and threats for those who do not. What would be the use of all this if man had no free will in spiritual things, that is, in such things as concern salvation and eternal life? It would be vain, and would serve no useful purpose. Moreover, if he were to persist in the idea that he had no power and no liberty in spiritual things, thus having no will power at all in these matters, the Sacred Scripture would appear to him only as so much blank paper without a syllable of writing, or as paper upon which a whole ink-pot has been spilled, or as so many tittles or jots without the letters, and thus as a meaningless volume.</p>
<p>
[2] It would not, indeed, be necessary to confirm this from the Word; but the Churches at this day have reached a state of mental vacuity in spiritual matters; and to justify their baseless speculations they quote certain passages from the Word to which they give a false interpretation. It is well, therefore, to adduce some passages which insist on man's doing and believing, such as the following:<p>"The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof" <a href="3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>.<p>Bring forth, therefore, fruits worthy of repentance...
