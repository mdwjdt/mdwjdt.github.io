788. Daniel prophesied that this church is going to supersede the churches that have existed since the world began, that it is going to last for ages of ages, and that it is going to be the crown of all the churches that have existed until now. The first time Daniel makes this prophecy is when he recounts and explains Nebuchadnezzar's dream to him. It concerned four kingdoms, which meant the four churches; these were represented in the form of the statue Nebuchadnezzar saw. The text says, "In the days of these [kings], the God of the heavens will cause a kingdom to arise, which will never be destroyed. It will consume all the other kingdoms, and it shall stand forever" (<a href="3927/daniel_2_44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). Daniel says that this will be caused by "a stone that becomes a great rock and fills the whole earth" (<a href="3927/daniel_2_35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>). A rock in the Word means the Lord's divine truth.
<p>The same prophet writes elsewhere:
<p>I saw visions in the night, and behold, there was someone coming with the clouds of the heavens - someone like the Son of Humankind. He was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom. All peoples, nations, and tongues will worship him. His dominion is a dominion of an age that will not pass, and his kingdom is one that will not perish. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>)
<p>Daniel says this after having seen the four great beasts coming up out of the sea (<a href="3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>). These beasts, too, represented the four former churches.
<p>Both Daniel's own words (<a href="3927/daniel_7_4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>) and the Lord's (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">30</a>) make it clear that Daniel's prophecies foretold what is happening at this very moment in time. Similar things are also said in the Book of Revelation:
<p>The seventh angel sounded. Then great voices came from heaven saying, "The kingdoms of the world have become kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ages of ages. " (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>) </p>

788. It was Daniel who prophesied that this church would take the place of those which had come into existence since the world began, and would last for ever and ever. It would thus be the crown of all the preceding churches. He made this prophecy first when he recounted and explained to Nebuchadnezzar his dream of the four kingdoms, which mean the four churches, represented by the statue he saw:<p>In the days of those kings the God of the heavens will cause a kingdom to arise which shall not perish for ever; and it will consume all those kingdoms, but itself will stand for ever, <a href="3927/daniel_2_44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<p>This was to be brought about by a stone becoming a mighty rock filling the whole earth (<a href="3927/daniel_2_35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>). Rock in the Word means the Lord in respect of Divine Truth. Elsewhere the same prophet says:<p>I was watching in the visions of the night, and I saw, one like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of the heavens. And to Him was given dominion, glory and the kingdom, and all peoples, nations and tongues shall worship Him. His dominion will be a dominion for ever, which will not pass away, and His kingdom one that will not perish, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p>He says this after seeing four great beasts coming up from the sea (<a href="3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>); these too represent the four former churches. Daniel prophesied these things about the present time, as is evident from his words at <a href="3927/daniel_12_4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>; as well as from the Lord's words, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">30</a>. Similar things are said in Revelation:<p>The seventh angel sounded; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying, The kingdoms of the world are made our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ever and ever, <a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>. </p>

788. That this church is to follow those that have existed since the beginning of the world, and that it is to endure for ages of ages, and is thus to be the crown of all the churches that have preceded, was foretold by Daniel; first, when he narrated and explained to Nebuchadnezzar his dream of the four kingdoms (which mean the four churches that were represented by the statue that he saw), saying: <p>In the days of those kings the God of the heavens shall make a kingdom to arise which shall not perish for ages, and it shall consume all those kingdoms; but itself shall stand for ages (<a href="3927/daniel_2_44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). <p>And this, he said, should be done, <p>By a stone becoming a great rock and filling all the earth (verse<a href="3927/daniel_2_35.htm">35</a>); <p>"rock" in the Word meaning the Lord in respect to Divine truth. The same prophet also says elsewhere: <p>I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven and there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages shall worship Him; His dominion is the dominion of an age, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13, 14</a>). <p>And this he said after he saw the four great beasts coming up out of the sea (verse<a href="3927/daniel_7_3.htm">3</a>), which beasts also represented the four prior churches. That all this was prophesied by Daniel respecting the present time, can be seen from his words in <a href="3927/daniel_12_4.htm">12:4</a>, as also, from the words of the Lord in <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">30</a>. Like things are said in the Apocalypse: <p>The seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's; and He shall reign unto the ages of the ages (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">11:15</a>). </p>

788. The prophet Daniel foretold that this Church is to succeed the Churches which have existed from the beginning of the world, and that it will endure for ever, and will thus be the crown of all the Churches which have hitherto existed. He first did this when he related and explained to Nebuchadnezzar his dream concerning the four kingdoms, by which are meant the four Churches, represented by the statue that appeared to him; for he says,<p>"In the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens (A.V., heaven) set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed... it shall consume all these kingdoms, but it shall stand forever" <a href="3927/daniel_2_44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>;<p>and that this should be effected by:<p>A stone that became a great rock (A.V., mountain), and filled the whole earth, <a href="3927/daniel_2_35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>.<p>By a rock in the Word is signified the Lord as to Divine Truth. The same prophet says in another place:<p>"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of the heavens (A.V., heaven). And there was given to Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed" <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p>This he says after he had seen the four great beasts coming up from the sea, verse 3, which also represented the four former Churches. That this prophecy of Daniel has relation to the present time, is evident from his words in chapter <a href="3927/daniel_12_4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>; and also from the Lord's words in <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">30</a>. Similar things are said in the Revelation,<p>"The seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever" <a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>. </p>

788. Quod haec Ecclesia successura sit Ecclesiis, quae a principio Mundi exstiterunt, et quod duratura sit in saecula saeculorum; et quod sic futura sit Corona omnium Ecclesiarum, quae antea fuerunt, prophetavit Daniel; primum dum enarravit et explicuit Nebuchadnezari somnium ejus de quatuor Regnis, per quae intelliguntur quatuor Ecclesiae per Statuam ei visam repraesentatae, dicens, In diebus [regum] <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
horum surgere faciet Deus Coelorum Regnum, quod in saecula non peribit, et consumet omnia illa Regna, illud autem stabit in saecula, <a href="3927/daniel_2_44.htm">2:44</a>, et quod hoc fiet per Lapidem factum in Petram magnam implentem omnem Terram, Vers. 35; per Petram in Verbo intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum. Et idem Propheta alibi, "Videns fui in visionibus noctis, et ecce cum Nubibus Coelorum sicut Filius hominis, et Huic datum est Dominium, et Gloria, et Regnum, et omnes populi, gentes et linguae Ipsum colent; Dominium Ipsius dominium saeculi, quod non transibit, et Regnum quod non peribit," <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13-14</a>; et haec dicit, postquam vidit quatuor Bestias magnas e mari ascendentes, Vers. 3; per quas etiam quatuor Ecclesiae priores repraesentatae sunt; quod haec a Daniele prophetata sint de hoc tempore, constat a verbis ejus, <a href="3927/daniel_12_4.htm">12:4</a>, tum a Domini verbis, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthaeus 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">30</a>. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Similia dicuntur in Apocalypsi, "Septimus Angelus clanxit; tunc factae sunt voces magnae e Coelo, [dicentes] facta sunt Regna [mundi] Domini nostri et Christi Ipsius, et regnabit in saecula saeculorum," <a href="3927/daniel_11_15.htm">11:15</a>.<p>
