<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>115</b>.（1）真正的救赎就是征服地狱，恢复天堂秩序，并藉此预备一个全新的属灵教会。我完全可以肯定，这三个事件构成救赎，因为主如今正实施救赎。救赎过程始于1757年所执行的最后审判，并且自那时起一直持续到现在。原因在于，现今主的第二次到来正在进行，一个新教会即将建立；而在此之前若不先征服地狱，恢复天堂秩序，这是不可能的事。我得以见证所发生的这一切，故能描述地狱如何被征服，新天堂如何被建立和安排；但要描述这一切需要一整卷书。不过，我曾于1758年在伦敦发表过一本小册子，揭示了最后的审判是如何进行的。<br />救赎就在于征服地狱，恢复天堂秩序，建立一个新教会，因为没有这三个事件，无人能得救。另外，它们遵循以下次序：在新的天使天堂得以形成之前，地狱必须先被征服；而在新教会在地上得以建立之前，这个新的天使天堂必须先得以形成；因为世人与天堂天使并地狱灵人联结得如此紧密，以至于就其心智的内层而言，他们与天使或灵人合而为一。该主题在本书最后一章，也就是论述时代的末了，主的到来和新教会的那一章会有详细解读。</p>

<p>
115. (1)真正的救贖是征服地獄,重建天國, 並藉此預備全新的屬靈教會。
<p>我可以十分肯定, 這三個行為就是救贖, 因為主現今正再次施行救贖的行為。這次新的救贖始於1757年, 隨著那年最後審判的完成而開始。這個救贖的過程從那時開始直到現在(1771年)。其原因是, 主的第二次降臨已在現今發生, 一個全新的教會正被建立。不過在地獄未被征服及天國未被重建之前, 新教會的建立就無法成就。
<p>我被允許去見證這些事情的發生, 我能描述地獄如何被征服,天國如何被重建, 不過要整整一本書才可講清。不過, 最後的審判如何發生的過程, 我已整理完畢, 1758年發表在一本小冊子上(就是『最後的審判』》那本書)。
<p>救贖的過程包括征服地獄,重建天國,建立新教會; 沒有這些, 無人能得救。事實上, 它們按順序發生:先是征服地獄, 然後一個新的天國才能形成, 最後才可以在地上建立新的教會。因為地上的人們與天國的天人及地獄的靈, 之間的聯繫如此緊密, 就人的內在思想而言, 三者是在一個層次上, 只是分屬不同的群體而已。這方面的主題在最後一章會有詳述, 就是關於時代的結局,主再來和新教會那一章。 </p>

115. 1. Redemption was actually a matter of gaining control of the hells, restructuring the heavens, and by so doing preparing for a new spiritual church. I can say with absolute certainty that these three actions are redemption, because the Lord is bringing about redemption again today. This new redemption began in the year 1757 along with a Last Judgment that happened at that time. The redemption has continued from then until now. The reason is that today is the Second Coming of the Lord. A new church is being instituted that could not have been instituted unless first the hells were brought under control and the heavens were restructured.
<p>Because I have been allowed to see it all I could describe how the hells were brought under control and how the new heaven was built and put into the divine design, but that would be the subject of a whole work. In a little work published in London in 1758 I did lay out how the Last Judgment was carried out.
<p>Gaining control over the hells, restructuring the heavens, and establishing a new church was redemption because without those actions no human being could have been saved. In fact, they follow in a sequence. The hells had to be controlled first before a new angelic heaven could be formed, and that heaven had to be formed before the new church on earth could be instituted, because people in the world are so closely connected to angels from heaven and spirits from hell that at the level of the inner mind they are one. This point will be taken up in the last chapter of this book, which specifically covers the close of the age, the Coming of the Lord, and the New Church [753-791]. </p>

115. (i) THE REAL REDEMPTION WAS THE CONQUEST OF THE HELLS AND THE ORDERING OF THE HEAVENS, AND PREPARATION BY THIS MEANS FOR A NEW SPIRITUAL CHURCH.<p>I can assert with complete certainty that these three events constitute redemption, since the Lord is to-day too carrying on the process of redemption, which began with the accomplishment of the Last Judgment in 1757. This redemptive process has continued from that time down to the present. The reason is that to-day the Second Coming of the Lord is taking place, and a new church is to be established, something which could not happen unless the conquest of the hells and the ordering of the heavens had taken place first. Since I have been permitted to witness all that has happened, I am able to describe how the hells were conquered and how a new heaven has been founded and arranged, but it would take a whole book to do so. However, I did reveal how the Last Judgment was carried out, in a small book published in London in 1758. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

[2] Redemption consisted in the conquest of the hells, the ordering of the heavens and the establishment of a new church, because without them no one could have been saved. This is their proper order: the hells had first to be conquered, before a new heaven of angels could be formed, and this had to be formed before a new church could be established on earth. For people in the world are so linked with the angels in heaven and the spirits in hell, that in the interiors of their minds they are identified with one party or the other. This subject will be discussed in detail in the last chapter of this book, dealing with the Ending of the Age, the Lord's Coming and the New Church.<p>

115. (1) Redemption itself was a subjugation of the hells, a restoration of order in the heavens, and by means of these a preparation for a new spiritual church. That these three things are redemption I can affirm with all certainty, since at this day also the Lord is effecting a redemption, which began in 1757, together with a final judgment which was then accomplished. This redemption has been going on up to the present time, and for the reason that at this day is the second coming of the Lord, and a new church is now to be established; and this could not be done without a previous subjugation of the hells and a restoration of order in the heavens. And as it has been granted to me to see all this, I am able to describe how the hells were subjugated, and the new heaven established and arranged: but this would require a whole volume. But how the final judgment was accomplished I have made known in a little work published at London in 1758. <p>Redemption was a subjugation of the hells, a restoration of order in the heavens, and the establishment of a new church, because without these no one could have been saved. Moreover, they follow in order; for the hells must be subjugated before a new angelic heaven can be formed; and this must be formed before a new church can be established on earth; because men in the world are so closely connected with angels of heaven and spirits of hell as on both sides to be one with them in the interiors of their minds. But this subject will be explained in the last chapter of this work, where the Consummation of the Age, the Coming of the Lord, and the New Church, will be treated of in detail. </p>

115. (1) REDEMPTION ITSELF WAS THE SUBJUGATION OF THE HELLS, THE ORDERLY ARRANGEMENT OF THE HEAVENS, AND THUS THE PREPARATION FOR A NEW SPIRITUAL CHURCH.<p>That redemption consists in these three things I can declare with the utmost certainty, for the Lord also at this day is accomplishing a redemption, which began in the year 1757, together with the Last Judgment, which was then completed. From that time right up to the present this redemption has continued, because now is the time of the Lord's Second Advent, and a New Church is to be established, which would be impossible unless the hells were first reduced to subjection and the heavens restored to order. As it was granted me to see all this, I can describe how the hells were subdued, and how the founding of the new heaven and its orderly arrangement were effected; but the description would require an entire volume. However, in a little work, published in London, in 1758, I have shown how the Last Judgment took place. The subjugation of the hells, the orderly arrangement of the heavens, and the establishment of a New Church constituted redemption, because without these operations no man could have been saved. Moreover, they follow in order; for the hells had first to be subdued before a new angelic heaven could be formed; and this had to be formed before a New Church could be established on earth; because men in the world are so connected with the spiritual world that their minds are in unison with angels in heaven or with spirits in hell. But this subject will be dealt with in the last chapter of this work where the Consummation of the Age, the Coming of the Lord, and the New Church are specifically treated. </p>

115. I. QUOD IPSA REDEMPTIO FUERIT SUBJUGATIO INFERNORUM, ET ORDINATIO COELORUM, ET PER ILLA PRAEPARATIO AD NOVAM ECCLESIAM SPIRITUALEM. Quod haec tria sint Redemptio, possum in omni certitudine dicere, quoniam Dominus etiam hodie facit Redemptionem, quae inchoavit Anno 1757 una cum ULTIMO JUDICIO, quod tunc factum est; ab illo tempore perstitit haec Redemptio huc usque; causa est, quia hodie est SECUNDUS ADVENTUS DOMINI, et Nova Ecclesia instituenda est, quae non institui potest, nisi praecedat subjugatio Infernorum et ordinatio Coelorum; et quia mihi datum est videre omnia, possum describere, quomodo subjugata sunt Inferna, et quomodo Novum Coelum conditum et ordinatum est, sed hoc foret integri operis; quomodo autem Ultimum Judicium peractum est, apertum feci in Codicillo An. 1758 Londini edito.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod subjugatio Infernorum, ordinatio Coelorum, ac instauratio Novae Ecclesiae fuerint Redemptio, est quia absque illis nullus homo salvari potuit; sequuntur etiam in ordine, primum enim subjuganda sunt Inferna, antequam Novum Coelum Angelicum conformari potest, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et hoc prius conformandum est, antequam Nova Ecclesia in terris institui potest, nam homines in Mundo cum Angelis Coeli et cum spiritibus Inferni ita conjuncti sunt, ut in mentium interioribus utrinque unum faciant: sed de hoc in Capite ultimo hujus Operis, ubi de CONSUMMATIONE SAECULI, DE ADVENTU DOMINI, et de NOVA ECCLESIA, in specie transigendum est.<p>
