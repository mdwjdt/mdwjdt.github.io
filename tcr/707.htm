707. The Lord's words make it very clear that bread means the same thing as flesh: "Jesus took the bread, broke it and gave it [to the disciples] and said, 'This is my body'" (Matthew 26:[26]; Mark 14:[22]; Luke 22:[19]). Also, "the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I am giving for the life of the world" (<a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51</a>). The Lord also says that he is "the bread of life. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever" (<a href="3927/john_6_48.htm">John 6:48</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_58.htm">58</a>).
<p>The same "bread" is also what is meant by the sacrificial animals, which are called bread in the following passages:
<p>The priest will burn them on the altar as the bread of an offering made by fire to Jehovah. (<a href="3927/leviticus_3_11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_16.htm">16</a>)
<p>The sons of Aaron will be holy before their God. They are not to profane the name of their God, because they make offerings by fire to Jehovah as the bread of their God. You will consecrate him, because he offers the bread of your God. A man of the seed of Aaron in whom there is any defect is not to come forward and offer the bread of his God. (<a href="3927/leviticus_21_6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_21.htm">21</a>)
<p>Command the children of Israel and say to them, "You are to observe my offering, my bread for the offerings made by fire that exude an aroma of rest. You are to offer them to me at the appointed time. " (<a href="3927/numbers_28_2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>)
<p>One who has touched something unclean is not to eat of the consecrated offerings; he is to wash his flesh in water. Afterward he may eat of the consecrated offerings, because that is his bread. (<a href="3927/leviticus_22_6.htm">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>)
<p>The food to eat from the consecrated offerings was the flesh of the sacrificial animals, which is here also called bread. See also <a href="3927/malachi_1_7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] The food offerings that were part of certain sacrifices were likewise made of grain, and were therefore a kind of bread; they, too, have the same meaning (<a href="3927/leviticus_2_1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-11</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_6_14.htm">6:14-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_7_9.htm">7:9-13</a>; and elsewhere). So does the bread that was on a table inside the tabernacle; it was called the showbread or the bread set before Jehovah (see <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>).
<p>As the following quotations make clear, bread in the Word means heavenly bread, not physical bread.
<p>Humankind does not live by bread alone; humankind lives by everything that comes from the mouth of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>)
<p>I will strike the earth with hunger - not hunger for bread or thirst for water but for hearing the words of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/amos_8_11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>)
<p>Furthermore the term "bread" is used to mean food of every kind (see <a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_4_7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_7_48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>). And in fact the word "food" itself means spiritual food, as the Lord's words make clear in the following passage:
<p>Work for food - not for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts to eternal life, which the Son of Humankind will give you. (<a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>) </p>

<p>
707. It is clearly established from the Lord's words that bread has much the same meaning as flesh:<p>Jesus taking bread broke it and gave it, saying, This is my body. Matt. chapter 26; Mark chapter 14; Luke chapter 22.<p>Also:<p>The bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51</a>.<p>He also says that He is the bread of life, and that he who eats of this bread will live for ever (<a href="3927/john_6_48.htm">John 6:48</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_58.htm">58</a>). This too is the bread meant by sacrifices, which are called bread in the following passages:<p>The priest is to burn it upon the altar, the bread of the fire-offering to Jehovah, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_16.htm">16</a>.<p>The sons of Aaron are to be holy to their God, and they are not to profane the name of their God, because they present the fire-offerings to Jehovah, the bread of their God. You are to sanctify him, because it is he who presents the bread of your God. A man of the seed of Aaron in whom there is a blemish is not to approach to present the bread of his God, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_21.htm">21</a>.<p>Command the Children of Israel and say to them, My gift, my bread for the fire-offerings for an odour of rest, you are to take care to present to me in due season, <a href="3927/numbers_28_2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>.<p>He who has touched an unclean thing is not to eat any of the sanctified things, but is to wash his flesh in water, and afterwards he may eat of the sanctified things, because that is his bread, <a href="3927/leviticus_22_6.htm">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>.<p>Eating of the sanctified things meant the flesh from the sacrifices, and this is here also called bread; see also <a href="3927/malachi_1_7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] The minhah in sacrifices, which were offerings of bread made from fine wheat-flour, had the same meaning (<a href="3927/leviticus_2_1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-11</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_6_14.htm">6:14-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_7_9.htm">7:9-13</a> and elsewhere). The same is true of the loaves placed on the table in the Tabernacle, which were called the bread of faces <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
or shewbread (on which see <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). It is not natural bread which is meant by bread, but heavenly bread, as is plain from these quotations:<p>It is not by bread alone that a person lives, but it is by everything that comes out of Jehovah's mouth that a person lives, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>.<p>I shall send hunger upon the land, not hunger for bread, nor thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah, <a href="3927/amos_8_11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>.<p>Moreover, bread means every kind of food (<a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_4_7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_7_48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>). It also means spiritual food, as is clear from these words of the Lord:<p>Work for food, not that which perishes, but that which lasts to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, <a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>.<p>

707. That "blood" and "flesh" have a like meaning is very clear from the Lord's words: <p>Jesus took bread and brake, and gave saying, This is My body (<a href="3927/matthew_26_26.htm">Matthew 26:20</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_22.htm">14:22</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>). <p>And again: <p>The bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world (<a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51</a>). <p>And He also says: <p>That He is the bread of life, and that if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever (<a href="3927/john_6_48.htm">John 6:48</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">6:51</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_58.htm">6:58</a>). <p>It is this bread also that is meant by the sacrifices that are called bread in the following passages: <p>The priest shall burn it upon the altar; it is the bread of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah (<a href="3927/leviticus_3_11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_16.htm">16</a>). <p>The sons of Aaron shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God, for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer. Thou shalt sanctify him, for he offereth the bread of thy God. No man of the seed of Aaron in which there shall have been a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the bread of his God (<a href="3927/leviticus_21_6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_21.htm">21</a>). <p>Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering and My bread for sacrifices made by fire, for an odor of rest, shall ye observe to offer unto Me in their due season (<a href="3927/numbers_28_2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>). <p>He that hath touched an unclean thing shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water; afterward he shalt eat of the holy things, because this is his bread (<a href="3927/leviticus_22_6.htm">Leviticus 22:6, 7</a>). <p>To eat of the holy things was to eat of the flesh of the sacrifices, which is here called "bread," as well as in <a href="3927/malachi_1_7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>. The "meal-offerings" used in the sacrifices, which were of fine wheaten flour, and were therefore bread, had the same signification (<a href="3927/leviticus_2_1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-11</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_6_14.htm">6:14-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_7_9.htm">7:9-13</a>, and elsewhere); also the bread on the table in the tabernacle, which was called "the bread of faces" or "shew-bread" (of which in <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). That "bread" in the Word means heavenly bread, not natural bread, is evident from the following passages: <p>Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>). <p>I will send a famine into the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah (<a href="3927/amos_8_11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>). <p>Moreover, "bread" means all food (<a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:59</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_4_7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_7_48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>). That it also means spiritual food is plain from these words of the Lord: <p>Work not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you (<a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>). </p>

Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God...." A man of the seed of Aaron, "that hath any blemish, shall not approach to offer the bread of his God" <a href="3927/leviticus_21_6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_21.htm">21</a>.<p>"Command the Children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for an odor of rest, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season" <a href="3927/numbers_28_2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>.<p>Whosoever has touched any unclean thing shall not eat of the holy things, but shall wash his flesh with water... He shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it is his bread (A.V., food). <a href="3927/leviticus_22_6.htm">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>.<p>To eat of the holy things was to eat the flesh of the sacrifices, which is here also called bread; so also in <a href="3927/malachi_1_7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>.

707. Quod per PANEM simile intelligatur quod per Carnem, constat clare ex Domini verbis, "Jesus accipiens PANEM, fregit et dedit, dicens, hic est Corpus meum, <a href="3927/matthew_26_1.htm">Matthaeus 26</a>:[<a href="3927/matthew_26_26.htm">26</a>,] <a href="3927/mark_14_1.htm">Marcus 14</a>:[<a href="3927/mark_14_22.htm">22</a>,] <a href="3927/luke_22_1.htm">Luca 22</a>[: <a href="3927/luke_22_19.htm">19</a>], tum, PANIS, quem Ego dabo, Caro mea est, quam Ego dabo pro Mundi vita, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">Johannes 6:51</a>, et quoque dicit, quod Ipse sit PANIS VITAE, qui manducat ex hoc PANE, VIVET IN AETERNUM," <a href="3927/john_6_48.htm">Johannes 6:48</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">51</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_58.htm">58</a>. Hic Panis etiam est, qui intelligitur per Sacrificia, quae vocantur Panis in sequentibus locis; Illa adolebit Sacerdos super Altari, PANIS IGNITI JEHOVAE, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_16.htm">16</a>. Filii Aharonis sancti erunt Deo suo, neque prophanabunt Nomen Dei sui, quia IGNITA JEHOVAE, PANEM DEI SUI illi offerentes. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Sanctificabis illum, quia PANEM DEI TUI ille offerens. Vir de Semine Aharonis, in quo fuerit macula, non accedet ad offerendum PANEM DEI SUI, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_21.htm">21</a>. Praecipe filiis Israelis, et dicas ad eos, Oblationem meam, PANEM MEUM, IN IGNITA ODORIS QUIETIS, observabitis, ut offeratis Mihi in stato tempore, <a href="3927/numbers_28_2.htm">Numeri 28:2</a>. Qui tetigerit immundum, non comedet de sanctificatis, sed lavabit carnem suam in aqua, et postea comedet de sanctificatis, QUIA PANIS EJUS HOC, <a href="3927/leviticus_22_6.htm">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>; comedere ex sanctificatis erat Carnem ex sacrificiis, quae hic quoque vocatur Panis; praeter apud <a href="3927/malachi_1_7.htm">Malachiam 1:7</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Per MINCHAS in sacrificiis, quae erant ex simila tritici, ita Panis, nec aliud significabatur, <a href="3927/leviticus_2_1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-11</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_6_7.htm">6:7-14</a>; <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
<a href="3927/leviticus_7_9.htm">7:9-13</a>, et alibi.

Quod non panis naturalis per Panem intelligatur, sed Panis coelestis, patet ex his, "Non per Panem solum vivit homo, sed per omne quod exit ex ore Jehovae vivit homo, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_3.htm">Deuteronomius 8:3</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>

Praeterea per Panem intelligitur omnis Cibus, <a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_25_30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_23.htm">40:23</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_4_7.htm">Numeri 4:7</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_7_48.htm">1 Regnum 7:48</a>. Quod etiam Cibus spiritualis, patet ab his Domini verbis, "Operamini Cibum, non qui perit, sed Cibum, qui manet in vitam aeternam, quem Filius hominis vobis dabit," <a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">Johannes 6:27</a>.<p>
