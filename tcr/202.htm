<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>202</b>.我得知，大洪水前的上古教会之人具有属天的品性，他们能凭借对应与天上的天使交谈。他们的智慧已达到这样的高度：他们不仅以属世的方式思想他们在地上所见到的任何事物，同时还以属灵的方式思想它，从而与天上的天使联结。我还得知，创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.21.htm">5:21</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.24.htm">24</a>）中提到的以诺和他的同僚通过聆听他们的谈话而搜集这些对应的知识，并将这门学问传给后代。结果，在亚细亚很多国家，尤其在迦南、埃及、亚述、迦勒底、叙利亚、阿拉伯、推罗、西顿和尼尼微等地，对应学不仅为人所知，还受到高度推崇。它从那里传到希腊，但在希腊却演变成了神话，这从古希腊着作明显看出来。</p>

202. 我被教導後才知道, 在大洪水之前的最早期教會中的人們, 有屬天的性質, 以致於他們能和天人對話。這些人因為熟知對應的知識而能與天人相互聯繫。他們的智慧所達到的程度:看到地上任何事物時, 不僅以屬地的方式來思考, 同時能以屬天的方式來思考;就此, 他們與天國中的天人能想到一塊。
<p>我還被教導:<a href="3927/genesis_5_21.htm">創世記5:21-24</a>中所說的以諾, 與他的朋友們一起, 從最早期人們的口述的傳說中收集關於對應的知識, 並向他們的後裔傳授這些知識。結果, 這些關於對應的知識不僅在中東地區的許多國家得到傳授, 並且發展到更遠的地區, 特別是迦南地,埃及,亞述,迦勒底,敘利亞及阿拉伯等地區, 甚至推羅,西頓與尼尼微等地。從那裡渡到希臘, 只不過在那裡成為神話; 從希臘最早期的著作中可以看出。 </p>

202. I have been taught that the people in the earliest church, which existed before the flood, had a nature so heavenly that they spoke with angels of heaven. The use of correspondences by these people enabled them to communicate with angels. As a result, the quality of their wisdom grew to the point where anything they saw on earth they thought about not only in an earthly way but also in a spiritual way; they and angels in heaven thought about it together.
<p>I have also been taught that Enoch (who is mentioned in <a href="3927/genesis_5_21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>), along with friends of his, collected correspondences from the oral tradition of the earliest people and spread the study of correspondences to his descendants. As a result, the study of correspondences was not only known in many countries in the Middle East but was also further developed, especially in the land of Canaan, Egypt, Assyria, Chaldea, Syria, and Arabia; and in Tyre, Sidon, and Nineveh. From there it crossed into Greece, but turned into myths there, as you can see from the earliest Greek writings. </p>

202. I have been taught that the people of the Most Ancient church, which existed before the flood, had such heavenly characters that they conversed with angels in heaven. They were able to do this by correspondences. So they reached such a pitch of wisdom that they not only thought naturally about anything they saw on earth, but at the same time also thought spiritually about it, and this established their link with angels in heaven. I was also taught that Enoch, who is mentioned in <a href="3927/genesis_5_21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>, together with his colleagues collected these correspondences by listening to their talk, and transmitted this science to posterity. As a result the science of correspondences was not merely known but held in high esteem in many Asiatic kingdoms, especially in the land of Canaan, Egypt, Assyria, Chaldaea, Syria, Arabia, Tyre, Sidon and Nineveh. From there it was transmitted to Greece, but was there transformed into myths, as is evident in the earliest Greek authors. </p>

202. I have been informed that the men of the Most Ancient Church which existed before the flood, were of a genius so celestial that they talked with the angels of heaven, and were able to talk with them by means of correspondences, and in consequence the state of their wisdom was such that whatever they saw on earth, they thought of not only naturally, but at the same time spiritually, thus conjointly with the angels of heaven. Furthermore, I have been informed that Enoch (who is mentioned in <a href="3927/genesis_5_21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>) and those associated with him collected correspondences from the lips of these men, and transmitted this knowledge to their posterity; and that from this it came to pass that in many of the kingdoms of Asia the knowledge of correspondences both existed and was cultivated, especially in the land of Canaan, in Egypt, Assyria, Chaldea, Syria, Arabia, Tyre, Sidon, and Nineveh, and that it was thence carried into Greece; but was there turned into myths, as can be seen from the writings of the ancient Greeks. </p>

202. I have been informed that the men of the Most Ancient Church, which existed before the Flood, were of so heavenly a genius that they conversed with the angels of heaven; and that they had the power to do so by correspondences. Consequently their wisdom became such that, whatever they saw on earth, they thought of not only naturally, but also spiritually, thus also in conjunction with the angels of heaven. I was further informed that Enoch, who is mentioned in <a href="3927/genesis_5_21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>, and his associates, collected correspondences from their speech, and transmitted this knowledge to posterity. As a result of this the science of correspondences was not only known but was also cultivated in many kingdoms of Asia, particularly in the Land of Canaan, Egypt, Assyria, Chaldaea, Syria, Arabia, and in Tyre, Sidon, and Nineveh. It was thence communicated to Greece; but it was there changed into fable, as may be seen from the literature of the oldest Greek writers. </p>

202. Instructus sum, quod homines Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, quae fuit ante Diluvium, tam coelesti genio fuerint, ut loquuti sint cum Angelis Coeli, et quod loqui potuerint cum illis per Correspondentias; inde status sapientiae illorum factus est talis, ut quicquid viderent in Tellure, non modo cogitarent de illo naturaliter, sed etiam simul spiritualiter, ita quoque conjunctim cum Angelis Coeli. Insuper instructus sum, quod CHANOCH, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
