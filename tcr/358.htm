358. (3)義與信之中的生命也可獲得。
<p>情況一樣, 當人接近主(祂是生命本身)時, 就獲得生命。接近祂的通道對任何人都是敞開的。祂不停地邀請所有人到祂裡。因為祂說:
<p>到我這裡來的, 必定不渴; 信我的, 永遠不餓。到我這裡來的, 我總不丟棄他(<a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">約翰福音6:35</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_37.htm">37</a>)。耶穌站著高聲說:"人若渴了, 可以到我這裡來喝"(<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">約翰福音7:37</a>)。天國好比一個王,為他兒子擺設娶親的筵席。就打發僕人去,請那些被召的人來赴席。往岔路口上去,凡遇見的,都召來赴席(<a href="3927/matthew_22_1.htm">馬太福音22:1-9</a>)。
<p>顯然, 沒有人會懷疑這樣的邀請或呼召是普世的, 接受的便是恩典。
<p>為何接近主就被賜予生命？因為主是生命本身, 不僅是信之生命, 還是義之生命。可從下列經文看出, 主是生命,人的生命源自主:
<p>太初有道。生命在祂裡頭, 這生命是人的光(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>)。父怎樣叫死人起來,使他們活著,子也照樣隨自己的意思使人活著(<a href="3927/john_5_21.htm">約翰福音5:21</a>)。父怎樣叫死人起來,使他們活著,子也照樣隨自己的意思使人活著(<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">約翰福音5:26</a>)。上帝的糧,就是那從天上降下來賜生命給世界的(<a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">約翰福音6:33</a>)。我對你們所說的話,就是靈,就是生命(<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">約翰福音6:63</a>)。耶穌說:"跟從我的,必要得著生命的光"(<a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">約翰福音8:12</a>)。我來了,是要叫他們得生命,並且得的更豐盛(<a href="3927/john_10_10.htm">約翰福音10:10</a>)。信我的人,雖然死了,也必活(<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">約翰福音11:25</a>)。我是道路,真理,生命(<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">約翰福音14:6</a>)。因為我活著,你們也要活著(<a href="3927/john_14_19.htm">約翰福音14:19</a>)。但記這些事叫你們可以因祂的名得生命(<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">約翰福音20:31</a>)。祂是永生(<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>)。
<p>信與義之中的生命意思指屬靈的生命, 當人活在世上時, 由主賜給他們。 </p>

358. (c) We are also able to acquire the life within faith and goodwill for ourselves. The situation is again the same. We acquire this life as we go to the Lord, who is life itself. No one's access to him is blocked. He constantly invites every person to come toward him. He says,
<p>Those who come to me will not hunger; those who believe in me will never thirst. Those who come to me I will not throw out the door. (<a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">John 6:35</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_37.htm">37</a>)
<p>Jesus stood and cried out, "If any are thirsty, they must come to me and drink. " (<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37</a>)
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like someone who put on a wedding for his son and sent his servants to call those who had been invited. Finally he said, "Go to the ends of the streets and invite any people you find to the wedding. " (<a href="3927/matthew_22_19.htm">Matthew 22:19</a>)
<p>Surely everyone knows that the Lord's invitation or calling is universal. So is the grace to accept it.
<p>By going to the Lord, we gain life because the Lord is life itself. He is not only the life within faith but also the life within goodwill. It is clear from the following passages that this life is the Lord and comes to us from the Lord:
<p>In the beginning was the Word. In it there was life, and that life was the light for humankind. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>)
<p>Just as the Father raises the dead and brings them to life, so also the Son brings to life those whom he wishes to. (<a href="3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>)
<p>As the Father has life in himself, so he has given the Son to have life in himself. (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>)
<p>The bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. (<a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>)
<p>The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life. (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>)
<p>Jesus said,
<p>Those who follow me will have the light of life. (<a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">John 8:12</a>)
<p>I have come so that they may have life and abundance. (<a href="3927/john_10_10.htm">John 10:10</a>)
<p>Those who believe in me, even if they die, they will live. (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25</a>)
<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)
<p>Because I live, you too will live. (<a href="3927/john_14_19.htm">John 14:19</a>)
<p>These things have been written so that you may have life in his name. (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>)
<p>He is eternal life. (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>)
<p>"The life within faith and goodwill" means the spiritual life the Lord gives people in their earthly lives. </p>

358. (iii) A person can acquire for himself a life of faith and charity.<p>It is the same with this, for he acquires it when he approaches the Lord, who is life itself. Nor is the approach to Him blocked for anyone, since He constantly invites everyone to come to Him. For He said:<p>He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. And I will not cast out anyone who comes to me, <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">John 6:35</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_37.htm">37</a>.<p>Jesus stood and cried, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink, <a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37</a>.<p>Elsewhere:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like [a king] <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

, and invite to the wedding anyone you find, <a href="3927/matthew_22_1.htm">Matthew 22:1-9</a>.<p>Surely no one can help knowing that the invitation or summons is addressed to everyone, and so is the grace shown in receiving them.<p>The reason why a person is given life by approaching the Lord is that the Lord is life itself, not only the life of faith, but also the life of charity. It is evident from the following passages that the Lord is life, and man's life comes from the Lord:<p>In the beginning was the Word. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>.<p>As the Father raises up the dead and makes them live, so the Son makes him whom He wishes live, <a href="3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>.<p>As the Father has life in Himself, so did He grant the Son to have life in Himself, <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>.<p>The bread of God it is which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world, <a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>.<p>The words which I speak to you are spirit and life, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>.<p>Jesus said, He who follows me will have the light of life, <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">John 8:12</a>.<p>I have come so that they may have life, and have it in abundance, <a href="3927/john_10_10.htm">John 10:10</a>.<p>He who believes in me, though he die, shall live, <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25</a>.<p>I am the way, truth and life, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>.<p>Because I live, you too shall live, <a href="3927/john_14_19.htm">John 14:19</a>.<p>These things have been written so that you may have life in His name, <a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>.<p>He is everlasting life. <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>Life in faith and charity means spiritual life, which is given to a person by the Lord during his natural life.<p>
