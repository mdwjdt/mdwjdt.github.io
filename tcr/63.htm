<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>63</b>.（5）神自其秩序的初至其秩序的末都是全在的。神凭借祂在当中的灵界太阳的热与光而自其秩序的初至其秩序的末都是全在的。秩序正是凭这太阳而得以产生，祂通过灵界太阳发出热与光，而这热与光自初至末充满整个宇宙，并产生人和一切动物里面的生命，以及世上一切植被的植物灵魂。这二者流入每一个事物，并使各自照着自创世时施加于它们的秩序而存活和生长。神虽然没有延伸，却充满宇宙的一切空间，故祂是全在的。别处还说明（30节），神是非空间的，却存在于一切空间，神是非时间的，却存在于一切时间。所以，整个宇宙就其本质和秩序而言，就是神的丰盛。正因如此，祂才凭祂的全在直觉万物，凭祂的全知预备万物，凭祂的全能产生万物。由此清楚可知，全在，全知和全能成为一体，换句话说，一个必然包含另一个，因而它们是不可分的。</p>

63. (5)上帝自始至終地全在於祂的定規中。
<p>從始至終在祂的定規中的全在, 是心靈世界中圍繞上帝的太陽所發生的熱與光的作用。聖規就是通過這太陽而被創造。自始至終, 上帝由此太陽發出熱和光遍及宇宙。那熱和光給了人類和動物生命。那熱和光還製造了世上所有植物擁有的"靈魂"。這二者流入到所有個體事物之中,並按創世時所賦予的定規令其生存並成長。
<p>因為上帝充滿于延展的宇宙萬物, 所以祂全在。在第<a href="30.htm">30</a>節我曾解釋過, 上帝獨立於空間之外而在所有的空間之中, 獨立於時間之外而在所有的時間之中。因此, 就其本質和定規而言, 宇宙就是上帝的充滿。因此, 祂藉著祂的全在來感知所有, 藉著祂的全知提供所有, 藉著祂的全能產生所有。於是很清楚, 全在,全知和全能是一; 每一個都以另一個為先決條件, 因此它們不能被分開。 </p>

63. 5. God is omnipresent in his design from beginning to end. God's omnipresence in his design from beginning to end is a function of the heat and light from the sun that surrounds God in the spiritual world. The divine design was created through this sun. From it God sends forth a heat and a light that pervade the universe from beginning to end. That heat and that light give life to humankind and to every animal. They also produce the plant soul that every plant in the world possesses. The two flow into every single thing and cause it to live and grow according to the design assigned to it upon creation.
<p>Because God is not extended and yet fills all things throughout the universe that are extended, he is omnipresent. I have shown elsewhere that God is in all space independently of space, and in all time independently of time [30], and therefore the universe in its essence and design is the fullness of God. Therefore he senses all things through his omnipresence, he provides all things through his omniscience, and he produces all things through his omnipotence. Clearly then, omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence are one; each presupposes the next. Therefore they cannot be separated. </p>

63. (v) GOD IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE FROM FIRST TO LAST IN HIS ORDER.<p>It is the heat and light of the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which God is, which makes Him present everywhere from first to last in His order. By means of this sun order came into existence, and from it He sends forth heat and light, which penetrate the universe from first to last and produce the life possessed by every human being and animal, and also the vegetative soul which every plant on earth has. Its heat and light act upon every single thing and cause each to live and grow in accordance with the order imposed on them from creation. Since God has no extent, yet fills all the space in the universe, He is omnipresent. It has been shown elsewhere [<a href="30.htm">30</a>] that God is non-spatially in all space and non-temporally in all time, as a result of which the universe is in respect of its essence and its order the fulness of God. This being so, God by His omnipresence perceives everything, by His omniscience provides everything, and by His omnipotence performs everything. This makes it plain that omnipresence, omniscience and omnipotence make one, in other words, one supposes the other and thus they cannot be divided. </p>

63. (5) God is omnipresent from the firsts to the lasts of His order. God is omnipresent from the firsts to the lasts of His order by means of the heat and light of the spiritual sun, in the midst of which He is. It was by means of that sun that order was produced; and from it He sends forth a heat and a light which pervade the universe from firsts to lasts, and produce the life that is in man and in every animal, and also the vegetative soul that is in every germ upon the earth; and these two flow into each thing and all things, and cause every subject to live and grow according to the order implanted in it by creation. And as God, though not extended, fills every extense in the universe, He is omnipresent. It has been shown elsewhere that God is in all space without space, and in all time without time, and consequently that the universe in its essence and order is the plenitude of God; and this being so, by His omnipresence He perceives all things, by His omniscience He provides all things, and by His omnipotence He effects all things. From this it is clear that omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence make one, or that one implies the others; and thus that they cannot be separated. </p>

63. (5) GOD IS OMNIPRESENT FROM FIRST THINGS TO LAST OF HIS ORDER.<p>God is omnipresent from first things to last of His order by means of the heat and light from the Sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which He is. By means of this Sun order was created, and from it He sends out the heat and light which pervade the universe from first things to last, producing life in men and in all animals, and also the vegetable life in every germinating thing on the earth. Heat and light enter by influx into all things in general and in particular, causing every subject to live and grow according to the order impressed upon it at Creation; and because God is not extended, and yet fills all things in the universe that are extended, He is omnipresent. It has been shown elsewhere that God is in all space yet without space, and in all time without time, and consequently that the universe as to its essence and order is the fullness of God; and because this is so, by His omnipresence He perceives all things, by His omniscience He provides for all things, and by His omnipotence He administers all things. Hence it is evident that omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence make one, or that each implies the other, and thus that they cannot be separated. </p>

63. V. QUOD DEUS OMNIPRAESENS SIT A PRIMIS AD ULTIMA SUI ORDINIS. Quod Deus omnipraesens sit a primis ad ultima sui Ordinis, est per Calorem et Lucem e Sole Mundi Spiritualis, in cujus medio est, per hunc Solem factus est Ordo, et ex illo emittit calorem et lucem, quae pervadunt <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Universum a primis ad ultima ejus, ac producunt vitam, quae est homini, et cuivis animali, et quoque animam vegetativam, quae est cuivis germini super Tellure, et illa duo influunt in omnia et singula, et faciunt ut unumquodvis subjectum vivat et crescat secundum Ordinem illis a creatione inditum; et quia Deus non est extensus, et usque implet omnia extensa Universi, omnipraesens est; quod Deus in omni spatio sit absque spatio, et in omni tempore absque tempore, et quod inde Universum quoad essentiam et ordinem sit plenitudo Dei, alibi ostensum est, et quia ita est, per omnipraesentiam percipit omnia, per Omniscientiam providet omnia, et per Omnipotentiam operatur omnia; unde patet, quod Omnipraesentia, Omniscientia et Omnipotentia unum faciant, seu quod una ponat alteram, et sic quod separari nequeant.<p>
