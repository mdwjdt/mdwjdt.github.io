<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>219</b>．（3）类似事物由经上提及的推罗王所在伊甸园里的各样宝石来表示。我们在以西结书中读到：<br />推罗王你智慧充足，全然美丽。你曾在伊甸神的园中，有各样宝石作你的服饰，就是红宝石、黄玉、金钢石、水苍玉、红玛瑙、碧玉、蓝宝石、绿宝石、红玉和黄金。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.12.htm">以西结书28:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.13.htm">13</a>）<br />在圣言中，“推罗”表在良善与真理的知识方面的教会；“王”表教会的真理；“伊甸园”表出自圣言的智慧和聪明；“宝石”表因良善而透明的真理，就是诸如在圣言字义中的那类。正因这些就是这些宝石的含义，故它们被称为他的“服饰”。字义对圣言内层来说就是一种服饰（参看213节）。</p>

<p>
219. (3)類似的事物也表示此意, 就是論到推羅國王擁有的伊甸園的寶石。
<p>我們在『以西結書』中讀到:推羅王啊, 你無所不備, 智慧充足, 全然美麗。你曾在伊甸, 上帝的園中, 佩戴各樣寶石, 就是紅寶石,紅璧璽,金鋼石,水蒼玉,紅瑪瑙,碧玉,藍寶石,綠寶石,紅玉和黃金(<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">以西結書28:12-13</a>)。
<p>在聖言中, "推羅"表示教會——關於(良善與真理的)知識方面。"王"表示教會的真理。"伊甸園"表示從聖言而來的智慧與聰明。"寶石"表示真理因良善而閃光, 正如真理在聖言之文字意義中那樣。這就是各樣石頭的示意, 它們被稱為"遮蓋", 就是說, 文字意義是聖言內在意義的遮蓋(<a href="213.htm">213</a>節有所描述)。 </p>

219. 3. The precious stones from the garden of Eden that the king of Tyre is said to have worn mean the same thing. We read in Ezekiel,
<p>O king of Tyre, you who seal up your measurement, you were full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering: ruby, topaz, and diamond; beryl, sardonyx, and jasper; sapphire, chrysoprase, and emerald; and gold. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>)
<p>In the Word, "Tyre" means the church in relation to its concepts of goodness and truth. The "king" means the truth in the church. The garden of Eden means wisdom and intelligence gained from the Word. Precious stones mean truths made translucent by goodness, like the truths in the Word's literal meaning. Because these truths are meant by those precious stones, the stones are called his covering. On the literal meaning covering the insides of the Word, see 213 above. </p>

<p>
219. (iii) THE PRECIOUS STONES IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, IN WHICH THE KING OF TYRE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN, HAVE A SIMILAR MEANING. We read in Ezekiel:<p>King of Tyre, you who set the seal upon your measured space, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, God's garden; every kind of precious stone was your covering, ruby, topaz and diamond, chrysolite, sardonyx and jasper, sapphire, chrysoprase and emerald, and gold, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>.<p>Tyre in the Word means the church in respect of its knowledge of good and truth; king means the church's truth, the garden of Eden wisdom and intelligence derived from the Word. Precious stones mean truths with light shining through them from good, of the sort found in the literal sense of the Word. It is because these were the meanings of those stones that they are called his covering. The literal sense is a covering for the interiors of the Word; see above (213). </p>

<p>
219. (3) Like things are meant by, the precious stones in the garden of Eden, where the King of Tyre is said to have been. We read in Ezekiel: <p>King of Tyre Thou sealest up thy measure, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, , the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>). <p>In the Word "Tyre" signifies the church in respect to knowledges of good and truth; "the king" signifies the truth of the church; "the garden of Eden" signifies wisdom and intelligence from the Word; "precious stones" signify truths translucent because of good, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word: and this being the signification of these stones, they are called "his covering." That the sense of the letter is a covering to the Interiors of the Word, may be seen above (n. <a href="213.htm">213</a>). </p>

219. (3) THE SAME ARE MEANT BY THE PRECIOUS STONES IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, WHERE THE KING OF TYRE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN.<p>It is written in Ezekiel: King of Tyre,<p>"Thou sealest up thy sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the ruby (A.V., sardius), the topaz, and the diamond; the beryl, the sardonyx, and the jasper the sapphire, the chrysoprasus (A.V., emerald), and the emerald (A.V., carbuncle); and gold" <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">28:12-13</a>.<p>By Tyre in the Word is signified the Church as to the knowledges of good and truth; by the king is signified the truth of the Church; by the Garden of Eden is signified wisdom and intelligence from the Word; and by precious stones are signified truths translucent from good, such as are in the sense of the Letter of the Word. Because this is the signification of those stones therefore they are called his covering, and it may be seen above in <a href="213.htm">213</a> that the sense of the Letter covers the interior things of the Word. </p>
