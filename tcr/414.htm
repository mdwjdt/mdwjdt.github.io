<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>414</b>.国家相对社群更是邻舍，因为国家由众多社群组成，因而对国家的爱更广更高。而且，爱国就是爱人民的福祉。国家是邻舍，还因为它就象父母；是生他养他保护他，并继续养育和保护他，使他免受伤害的父母。人应当根据国家需要，出于爱国而向国家行善。其中有些需要是属世的，有些需要是属灵的。属世的需要涉及世俗的生活和秩序；属灵的需要涉及属灵的生活和秩序。<br />当爱国胜己，而不是如己，这是刻在人心里的一条律法。每个正义之人都赞成的众所周知的信条由此而来：即倘若国家遭受敌人毁灭或其它危险的威胁，为保卫国家而牺牲是一种高尚行为，一个士兵应以为国流血为荣。人们这么说是因为，当深爱自己的国家。应当知道，那些深爱自己的祖国，并出于善愿而向国家行善之人，死后都热爱主的国，因为那时，主的国就是他们的国家；凡爱主之国的，都爱主，因为主是其国度的全部中的全部。</p>

414. 國家相對於社群, 更是鄰舍, 因為國家由眾多社群構成。因而愛國的層次就更廣更高。另外, 愛國也是愛人民的幸福。
<p>國家是鄰舍, 還因為她像父母; 我們生在其中; 她曾養育我們且仍在養育; 她曾保護我們且還在保護我們免受傷害。
<p>人當按照國家的需要, 出於愛國而向國家行良善。有些需要是屬世的, 有些需要是屬靈的。屬世的需要關注於世俗的生命與秩序; 屬靈的需要關注於屬靈的生命與秩序。
<p>在人心裡刻寫著一條律法:當愛自己的國家, 不要視為愛自己那樣, 而是勝過愛自己。這條律法命令, 並且每個正義之人也聲明, 倘若國家在敵人或其它危險的威脅下面臨危機, 為保衛國家而捐軀是高尚的行為, 士兵當為灑血戰場而自豪。人們這樣說, 是因為當深愛自己的國家。
<p>當知道一件事, 那些出於義而愛國並有益於其國之人, 死後愛主的國度, 因為主的國在那時是他們的國家。愛主國度的人們愛主, 因為主是該國度的一切。 </p>

414. Our country is our neighbor more than our community is, because our country consists of many communities. Love for our country is therefore broader and higher. Loving our country is also loving the well-being of the general public.
<p>Our country is our neighbor because it is like a parent. We were born in it. It has nourished us and continues to nourish us. It has kept us safe from harm and continues to do so.
<p>We are to do good to our country with love according to what it needs. Some of its needs are earthly and some are spiritual. Its earthly needs center on its civic life and order. Its spiritual needs center on its spiritual life and order.
<p>We are to love our country not merely as much as we love ourselves; we are to love it more. There is a law written on the human heart that gives rise to the statement all just people say when they are in imminent danger of dying because of an enemy or some other cause. They say that it is a noble thing to die for their country. They say that it is a glorious thing for soldiers to shed their blood for their country. They say this because that is how much one ought to love one's country.
<p>It is important to know that if people love their country and benefit it because they wish it well, they love the Lord's kingdom after death. The Lord's kingdom is their country at that point. And those who love the Lord's kingdom love the Lord, since the Lord is everything to all his kingdom. </p>

414. The reason one's country is more the neighbour than one's community is that it is composed of a number of communities, so that love directed towards it is wider and higher. Moreover, loving one's country is loving the well-being of the people. One's country is the neighbour because it is a kind of parent; it is where one was born; it has fed and feeds one; it has protected and protects one from injury. One should do good to the country one loves according to its needs, some of which are natural, some spiritual. Natural needs are concerned with its secular life and order, spiritual ones with its spiritual life and order.</p>
<p>
 [2] There is a law engraved on the hearts of men that one's country should be loved, not as a person loves himself, but more than oneself. This law commands, and this is what every righteous man declares, that if one's country is threatened with destruction by an enemy or any other danger, it is a noble act to die in its defence, and a soldier should take pride in shedding his blood for it. People say this because one's country ought to be loved that dearly. It needs to be known that those who love their country and do good to it as the result of their good will, after death love the Lord's kingdom, since this is then their country; and those who love the Lord's kingdom love the Lord, because the Lord is all in all to His kingdom. </p>

414. One's country is more a neighbor than a single community, because it consists of many communities, and consequently love towards the country is a broader and higher love. Moreover, loving one's country is loving the public welfare. One's country is the neighbor, because it is like a parent; for one is born in it, and it has nourished him and continues to nourish him, and has protected and continues to protect him from injury. Men ought to do good to their country from a love for it, according to its needs, some of which are natural and some spiritual. Natural needs relate to civil life and order, and spiritual needs to spiritual life and order. That one's country should be loved, not as one loves himself, but more than himself, is a law inscribed on the human heart; from which has come the well-known principle, which every true man endorses, that if the country is threatened with ruin from an enemy or any other source, it is noble to die for it, and glorious for a soldier to shed his blood for it. This is said because so great should be one's love for it. It should be known that those who love their country and render good service to it from good will, after death love the Lord's kingdom, for then that is their country; and those who love the Lord's kingdom love the Lord Himself, because the Lord is the all in all things of His kingdom. </p>

414. One's country is the neighbor more than a society, because it consists of many societies; and consequently love towards it is of a more extensive and higher kind; moreover, to love one's country is to love the public welfare. A man's country is the neighbor, because it resembles a parent; for in it he was born, it has nourished and still nourishes him, and it continues to protect him, as it has always done. Men are bound from love to do good to their country according to its needs, some of which are natural and some spiritual. Natural needs regard civil life and order; and spiritual needs regard spiritual life and order. That every man is bound to love his country, not as he loves himself, but with a greater love, is a law inscribed on the human heart; hence the universal maxim, to which every upright man subscribes, that if ruin threatens one's country from an enemy or any other source, it is noble to die for it, and glorious for a soldier to shed his blood in its defense. This maxim has been so expressed to emphasize how greatly one's country should be loved. Those who love their country and render it good service from goodwill, after death, love the Lord's kingdom, for this is now their country; and those who love His kingdom, love the Lord, because the Lord is the all in all of His kingdom. </p>

414. Quod Patria sit Proximus prae Societate, est quia illa ex pluribus Societatibus consistit, et inde est Amor erga illam amor extensior et superior; et insuper amare patriam, est amare salutem <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
publicam; Quod Patria sit Proximus, est quia illa Parentis instar est, ibi enim natus est; illa nutrivit et nutrit illum; illa ab injuriis tutata est et tutatur illum. Patriae ex Amore benefaciendum est secundum necessitates ejus; quarum quaedam sunt naturales, quaedam spirituales; Naturales spectant vitam et ordinem civilem, Arcana Coelestia <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Spirituales vitam et ordinem spiritualem.</p>

non sicut homo amat seipsum, sed prae se ipso, est Lex inscripta Cordibus humanis, ex qua promulgatum est hoc, quod enuntiatur ab omni justo, quod si imminet exitium ejus ex hoste, aut aliunde, illustre sit pro illa mori, ac militi gloriosum sanguinem pro illa effundere; hoc dicitur, quia illa in tantum amanda est. Sciendum est, quod illi, qui amant Patriam, et ei ex benevelle benefaciunt, post mortem ament Regnum Domini, nam hoc ibi est Patria, et qui amant Regnum Domini, illi amant Dominum, quia Dominus est omne in omnibus sui Regni.<p>
