<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>457</b>.那些只拜神，却不行出仁爱的好行为之人的情形则不同。这些人就象那些背约之人。而那些将神一分为三，分别敬拜每一个神之人的情形也不同；还有那些只靠近神，却不靠近处于其人身中的神之人的情形又不同。这些人就是那“不从门进去，倒从别处爬进羊圈”的人（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.1.htm">约翰福音10:1</a>）。那些通过确认否认主的神性之人的情形亦不同。所有这些人都不会与神结合，故没有得救。他们的仁爱无非是不正当的仁爱，这种仁爱不会实现面对面的结合，只会带来背对背的结合。<br />有必要简要说说这结合是如何实现的。 神流入人对祂的理解力中，带来对神的承认，同时赐下祂对人类的爱。若人只接受前者，而不接受后者，流注只能到达他的理解力，而到不了他的意愿，他仍停留在对神的理解力中，而缺乏对神的内在承认，因此他的状态类似冬天花园的状态。但是，若二者都接受，流注就会到达他的意愿，并由此进入他的理解力，从而占据他的整个心智。这时，他就会拥有对神的内在承认，这种承认会给他对神的理解力带来生命；他的状态类似春天花园的状态。<br />结合是通过仁爱实现的，因为神爱每个人；由于祂无法直接向人行善，而只能间接通过其他人，故祂会将自己的爱呼入人里面，就象祂将对小孩子的爱呼入其父母里面一样。凡接受这爱的人都会与神结合，并通过神的爱去爱他的邻舍。在人里面，神的爱就包含在他对邻舍的爱里面，正是这爱赋予他行动的意愿和能力。<br />由于没人能行出善事，除非在他看来，他的能力、意愿和行为似乎出于他自己，故这种表象被赐予了他；当他貌似自主自由行善时，这善就会归给他，被当作是实现结合的互动行为。这就象主动和被动之间的关系，被动的合作是通过被动中的主动产生的。或象行为中的意愿，言语中的思维，和作用于这二者至内层的灵魂。或象动作中的努力；以及种子的繁殖力，它从内作用于树液，使树生长，直到结出果实，并通过果实产出新种子。或象光照射到宝石上，而光的反射则取决于它所照射部分的质地，从而产生各种颜色，这些颜色看似属于宝石，而事实上是光的特性。</p>

<p>
457. 只是敬拜上帝,卻不履行與義相關的好行為, 這等人情況就不同了; 這些人就像毀約者(只簽約, 不履約)。而將上帝劃分為三位, 分別敬拜每一位; 或者只是接近上帝,而不接近祂所取之人, 情況也不相同; 這些人就是"不從門,而從別處爬入羊圈者"(<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">約翰福音10:1</a>)。那些堅決不相信主的神性之人, 更是不同。上述之人無法與上帝建立關係, 也無法得救。他們的義也只能是非法的, 所形成的關係不是面對面, 而是背對背。
<p>[2]要簡短講講愛上帝與愛鄰舍如何聯合。上帝將每個人對祂的概念流注到人的裡面, 並帶來對祂的承認。同時, 上帝還將祂對人類的仁愛流注並帶給人們。倘若一個人只是接受前面的流注, 而不接受第二個, 那麼他只能以認知,而非意志來接受上帝的流注。他保持著對上帝的認識, 但缺乏任何對上帝的內心上的承認, 以至於他的境況就像嚴冬季節裡的花園。如果兩者都接受, 此流注到達他的意志,並由此進入他的認知, 從而佔據他的整個思想。於是, 他形成了對上帝內心上的承認, 將對上帝的概念帶來生命, 以至於他的狀況如同春季裡的花園。
<p>[3]義成就了這樣的聯合:上帝愛每一個和所有人, 卻不能直接讓他們得益, 只能通過其他人間接來愛他們, 這樣上帝便將祂的愛注入到人們裡面, 正如祂將對子女之愛注入給為人父母者。任何接收此愛的人皆與上帝連接, 上帝的愛使他愛鄰舍。在他裡面, 上帝的愛被溶入到他對鄰舍之愛中, 這樣就賜給他去行動的意志與能力。
<p>[4]除非看起來好像是自己的能力與意志, 並且行動出自於自己, 沒有哪個能完成任何好行為, 這樣的表象是許可的。當他自由地去行動,仿佛是自己主動, 這樣行出來的善便算為他的, 作為他回應的行為, 以此帶來連接。
<p>這樣的情形就如同積極與消極之間的關係, 當消極因素接受積極因素時, 二者之間的合作便出現。或者, 就像意圖呈現於行動中, 思維呈現在話語中, 心靈在至深層面作用於二者。或者, 就像原動力呈現於動作之中; 就像結果的能力呈現於種子中, 此能力從內部作用於樹液, 令樹長成,直到結出果實, 並通過果實產生新鮮的種子。或者, 就像光射落在寶石上, 照著內部的質地反射光芒, 顯為不同的色彩, 仿佛是寶石自己發出的色彩, 事實上是光的性能而已。 </p>

<p>
457. It is different for people who only worship God but do not also perform good actions related to goodwill. These people are like covenant breakers. It is different again for people who divide God into three and worship each one separately. It is different again for people who go to God, but not in his human manifestation. These are the people "who do not enter through the door but instead climb up some other way" (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>). It is different again for people who deny with conviction that the Lord is divine. All these types of people lack a connection to God and therefore lack salvation. The goodwill they have is illegitimate. This type of goodwill forms a connection that is not face to face but side to side or back to back.
</p>
<p>
[2] I will briefly explain how loving God and loving our neighbor are connected. With all of us, God flows into our concepts of him and brings us true acknowledgment of him. He also flows into us and brings us his love for people. If we accept only the first inflow but not the second, we receive that inflow with our intellect but not our will. We keep the concepts of God that we have without arriving at an inward acknowledgment of God. Our state is then like a garden in winter.
<p>If we accept both types of inflow, however, we receive the inflow with our will and then our intellect - that is, with our whole mind. We then develop an inner acknowledgment of God that brings our concepts of God to life. Our state is then like a garden in spring.
</p>
<p>
[3] Goodwill makes the connection, because God loves every one of us but cannot directly benefit us; he can benefit us only indirectly through each other. For this reason he inspires us with his love, just as he inspires parents with love for their children. If we receive this love, we become connected to God and we love our neighbor out of love for God. Then we have love for God inside our love for our neighbor. Our love for God makes us willing and able to love our neighbor.
</p>
<p>
[4] We cannot do anything good if it does not seem to us that our power, willingness, and actions come from ourselves. Therefore we are granted the appearance that they do. When we freely do something good as if we were acting on our own, this goodness is attributed to us and is taken as our response, and this forges the connection.
<p>The situation here is like something active and something passive and the cooperation of the two that occurs when the passive element accepts the active one.
<p>The situation is also like the intention present in people's actions, the thinking present in their speech, and the soul working from the inside on both the intention and the thinking. It is like the originating force that is present in a motion. It is like the prolific power present in the seed of a tree. That power acts from the inside on the various forms of sap that develop the tree all the way to the point of bearing fruit. Through the fruit the tree produces new seeds. It is also like the light in precious stones that is reflected depending on the textures of the interior. Different colors appear as a result, as if they were the stones colors, but they are really the colors of the light. </p>

457. The case is different with those who only worship God and do not at the same time perform good deeds out of charity. These people are like those who tear up an agreement. It is different again with those who divide God into three, and worship each one separately; and different yet again with those who approach God, but not in His Human. These are the people who do not go in by the door, but climb up another way (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>). It is different yet again with those who are confirmed unbelievers in the Lord's divinity. None of these groups can achieve linking with God, and as a result salvation. Their charity too can only be spurious, and this does not allow linking face to face, but only at the side or back.</p>
<p>
[2] A few words must be said on how the linking takes place. God flows into what everyone knows about God, bringing about an acknowledgment of God, and at the same time imparting His love for mankind. If a person receives only the first and not the second, the inflow reaches only his understanding, and not his will, and he remains knowing about God without any inward acknowledgment of God, so that his condition resembles that of a garden in wintertime. But if a person receives both the first and the second, the inflow reaches his will and comes from there into his understanding, so occupying his whole mind. Then he makes an inward acknowledgment of God, which brings to life what he knows about God, so that his condition resembles that of a garden in springtime.</p>
<p>
[3] The reason why linking is produced by charity is that God loves each and every human being; and because He cannot do good to them directly, but only indirectly by means of other people, He therefore breathes into people His love, just as He breathes into parents love for their children. Anyone who receives that love is linked to God, and the love of God makes him love the neighbour. In him, the love of God is contained within his love towards his neighbour, and it is this which gives him his will and ability to act.</p>
<p>
[4] Since no one can do any good deed unless it seems to him as if his ability, will and activity come from himself, this appearance is granted to him; and when he does it freely as if of his own accord, it is imputed to him, and accepted as the reciprocal act which brings about linking. This is like the relationship between active and passive, and the co-operation of the passive being produced in it as the result of the active. Or it is like the will being present in actions, and thought being present in speech, and the soul working at the innermost level on each of these. Or it is like effort in motion; and like the reproductive principle of the seed, which acts from within on the juices, causing the tree to grow until it produces fruit, and by means of the fruit to produce fresh seeds. Or it is like light falling on precious stones, the reflexion of which depends on the texture of the parts it strikes, thus producing various colours, which seem to belong to the gems, when in fact they are properties of the light. </p>

<p>
457. It is different with those who merely worship God, and do not at the same time do good works from charity. These are like those who violate covenants. It is different again with those who divide God into three and worship each one separately; and still different with those who do not approach God in His Human; these are such <p>As enter not by the door, but climb up some other way (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>). <p>It is also different with those who from confirmation deny the Lord's Divinity. With all of these there is no conjunction with God, and therefore no salvation; and their charity is nothing but spurious charity, and this does not effect conjunction by the face, but by the side or back.
</p>
<p>
[2] How conjunction is effected shall be told in a few words. With every man God flows into man's knowledge of Him with acknowledgment of Him, and at the same time flows in with His love towards men. The man who receives in the former way only, and not in the latter, receives that influx in the understanding and not in the will, and remains in knowledge of God without an interior acknowledgment of God; and his state is like that of a garden in winter. But the man who receives in both ways, receives the influx in the will and from that in the understanding, thus in the whole mind, and he has an interior acknowledgment of God which vivifies in him the knowledges of God; and his state is like that of a garden in spring.
</p>
<p>
[3] Conjunction is effected by charity, because God loves every man, and as He cannot do good to man immediately, but only mediately through men, He inspires men with His own love, as He inspires parents with love for their children; and the man who receives that love has conjunction with God, and from God's love loves his neighbor; and in him God's love is within man's love towards the neighbor, and produces in him the will and the ability.
</p>
<p>
[4] Moreover, as man does nothing that is good unless it appears to him that the ability, the will, and the doing are from himself, this appearance is granted him; and when he does good from freedom as if of himself, it is imputed to him, and is accepted as the reciprocation by which conjunction is effected. This is like active and passive, and that cooperation of the passive which is effected from the active in the passive. It is also like will in doing, and like thought in words, the soul operating from the inmost into both. It is also like effort in motion; and like the prolific in seed, which from the interior operates in the juices through which the tree grows even to fruit, and through fruit produces new seed. It is also like light in precious stones which is reflected according to the texture of the parts, producing various colors, belonging apparently to the stones, but in fact to the light. </p>

457. It is otherwise with those who merely worship God and who do not at the same time practice good works from the principle of charity; these are like persons who break a covenant. It is otherwise again with those who divide God into three, and worship each one separately; and also with those who do not approach God in His Human. These are they:<p> 'enter not by the door, but climb up some other way.' <a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1-9</a>.<p>It is otherwise also with those who have confirmed themselves in a denial of the Lord's Divinity. In all these cases there is no conjunction with God, and consequently no salvation. Their charity is only spurious, which does not conjoin face to face, but on the side, or at the back.</p>
<p>
[2] How conjunction is effected shall be briefly explained. With every man God enters by influx with an acknowledgment of Himself into such knowledge of Him as the man possesses; and at the same time He flows in with an influx of His own love towards all men. The man who receives the influx only as it enters in the former manner and not in the latter, receives it in his understanding and not in his will; and he remains in his knowledge without an interior acknowledgment of God. His state is like that of a garden in winter. On the other hand, the man who receives both kinds of influx, receives it in his will and thence in his understanding, and consequently in his whole mind; and he has an interior acknowledgment, which imparts life to his knowledge of God. His state is like that of a garden in spring.</p>
<p>
[3] Conjunction is effected by means of charity, because God loves every man; and as He cannot do good to anyone immediately, but only mediately through the instrumentality of men, He therefore inspires men with His love, as He inspires parents with love for their children. The man who receives that love is conjoined with God, and he loves the neighbor from the love of God. With him the love of God is inwardly within his love towards the neighbor, directing both his will and his power. Since a man does nothing good unless it appears to him as if the power, the will and the deed are of himself, therefore this appearance is granted him; and when he does good from freedom as of himself, it is imputed to him, and accepted as that reciprocal factor by which conjunction is effected. It is an example of the co-operation that takes place between the active and the passive, when the active rouses into activity what was formerly passive. Thus it is like the will in actions, and the thought in speech, and the soul acting from the inmost on both. It is like effort in motion, and also like the prolific principle in the seed acting from within upon the sap by which the tree grows to fruitage and the production of new seeds from the fruit. It is also like light in its action upon precious stones, which is reflected according to the texture of their parts, giving rise to various colors as if they belonged to the stones, when in reality they belong to the light. </p>

457. Aliter apud illos, qui in solo Cultu Dei sunt, et non simul in Bonis operibus ex Charitate; hi sunt similes illis, qui discindunt foedus; adhuc aliter apud illos, qui dividunt Deum in tres, et unumquemvis separatim colunt: adhuc aliter apud illos, qui Deum non in Humano suo adeunt; hi sunt, Qui non ingrediuntur per januam, sed ascendunt aliunde, <a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">Johannes 10:1</a>; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et adhuc aliter apud illos qui Divinitatem Domini ex confirmatione negant; apud hos et illos non est conjunctio cum Deo, et inde non salvatio; et Charitas illorum non est alia quam spuria, et haec non conjungit a facie, sed a latere, aut a tergo.</p>
<p>
[2] Quomodo Conjunctio fit, etiam paucis dicetur: Deus influit apud omnem hominem cum agnitione Ipsius in Cognitiones de Ipso, et simul influit cum Amore suo erga homines; homo qui recipit modo prius et non posterius, is recipit Influxum illum in Intellectu et non in Voluntate, et manet in cognitionibus absque interiore agnitione Dei, et ejus status est sicut Horti tempore hyemis; at homo qui recipit et prius et posterius, is recipit influxum in Voluntate et inde Intellectu, ita tota Mente, et ei est interior agnitio Dei, quae cognitiones de Deo apud illum vivificat; hujus status est sicut Horti tempore veris.</p>
<p>
[3] Quod conjunctio fiat per Charitatem, est causa, quia Deus amat unumquemvis hominem, et quia ei benefacere non potest immediate, sed per homines mediate, ideo iis inspirat suum amorem, sicut inspirat parentibus amorem erga liberos, et homo qui illum recipit, conjungitur Deo, et amat proximum ex amore Dei; apud hunc est Amor Dei intus in Amore hominis erga proximum, qui operatur velle et <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
posse apud illum.</p>
<p>
[4] Et quia homo nihil boni facit, nisi ei appareat sicut posse, velle, et facere, sint a se, ideo hoc datum est ei, et cum id facit ex libero ut a se, ei imputatur illud, et acceptatur ut reciprocum, per quod fit conjunctio; et hoc se habet sicut activum et passivum, et hujus cooperatio, quod fit ex activo in passivo; et hoc se habet sicut Voluntas in actionibus et Cogitatio in loquelis, et Animae ab intimo operantis in utramque; et se habet sicut Conatus in motu; et quoque sicut Prolificum seminis, quod ab interiori agit in succis, per quos crescit arbor usque ad fructus, et per fructus producit nova semina: et se habet sicut Lux in lapidibus pretiosis, quae secundum texturas partium reflectitur, unde varii colores, sicut forent lapidum, cum tamen sunt lucis.<p>
