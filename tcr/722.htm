722. We Come Forward Worthily to Take the Holy Supper When We Have Faith in the Lord and Goodwill toward Our Neighbor - That Is, When We Have Been Regenerated
<p>Every Christian who studies the Word knows, acknowledges, and perceives that the three universal elements of the church are God, goodwill, and faith. These are universal elements because they are the universal means of being saved.
<p>Before we can be said to be religious and before anything of the church can be established in us we have to acknowledge the existence of God; any reasoning that has anything spiritual within it affirms the necessity of this. Therefore if we come forward to take the Holy Supper but do not acknowledge the existence of God, we desecrate the Holy Supper. We see the bread and wine with our eyes and we taste them with our tongue, but our mind is thinking, "This ritual is pointless. How do these elements differ from what I have on my table at home? I am only going through this to avoid the shame of being accused of being an atheist, first by the priest and then by everyone else. "
</p>
<p>
[2] Once we have come to acknowledge the existence of God, goodwill is the second means that allows us to take the Holy Supper worthily. This is clear both from the Word and from the statements that are read throughout the Christian world before people come forward for the Holy Supper.
<p>As for the Word, it teaches that the first commandment and rule is to love God above all and to love our neighbor as ourselves (<a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">Matthew 22:35-40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>). Paul teaches that there are three things that contribute to our salvation, and the greatest of these is goodwill (<a href="3927/1-corinthians_13_13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). "We know that God does not hear sinners, but if people worship God and do his will, he hears them" (<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>). "Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire" (<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-20</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] As for the statements that are read throughout the Christian world before people come forward for the Holy Supper, these statements sternly warn people to find goodwill through reconciliation and repentance first. The only example that I will copy out here is the statement read in England to people about to partake of the Holy Supper:
<p>The way and means of becoming a worthy partaker in the Holy Supper is first to examine your life and your conversations by the rule of God's commandments. In whatever regard you notice that you have committed an offense of will, speech, or act, then bewail your own sinfulness and confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amending your life. If you observe that your offenses are not only against God but also against your neighbors, you shall reconcile yourselves to them, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction to the utmost of your power for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other, and being likewise ready to forgive others who have offended you, just as you wish to have forgiveness from God for your offenses. Otherwise receiving the Holy Supper does nothing but increase your damnation. Therefore if any of you is a blasphemer of God, or a hinderer or slanderer of his Word, [or an adulterer,] or someone taken with malice or ill will, or involved in any other grievous crime, repent of your sins. Or else do not come to the Holy Supper; otherwise, after you take it the Devil may enter into you as he entered into Judas, fill you with all wickedness, and bring you to destruction of both body and soul.
</p>
<p>
[4] Faith in the Lord is the third means of worthily enjoying the Holy Supper, because goodwill and faith act as one, like heat and light in spring; every type of tree comes back to life when heat and light work together. Likewise, it is spiritual heat (goodwill) and spiritual light (truth related to faith) that bring us all to life.
<p>The following passages make it clear that faith in the Lord has this effect:
<p>Those who believe in me will never die; they will live. (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>)
<p>This is the will of the Father, that all who believe in the Son should have eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>)
<p>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son so that everyone who believes in him would have eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>)
<p>Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead God's anger will remain upon them. (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>)
<p>We are in the truth in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He is the true God and eternal life. (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>) </p>

<p>
722. VI. The people who worthily approach the Holy Supper are those who have faith in the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, so those who have been regenerated.<p>God, charity and faith are the three universals of the church, because they are the universal means to salvation. This is known, acknowledged and grasped by any Christian who studies the Word. Reason itself, at least if it contains any spirituality, insists that God must be acknowledged, if a person is to have any religion and any part of the church in him. If therefore anyone approaches the Holy Supper without acknowledging God, he profanes it. His eye sees the bread and wine, he tastes them on his tongue; but his mind is thinking: 'This is surely a matter of indifference. How are the bread and wine any different from what I have on my table? However, I do this to avoid being blamed by the priesthood, and so by the common people, as being an atheist.'</p>
<p>
[2] After the acknowledgment of God the second means which makes one worthy to approach is charity. This fact is established both from the Word and from the exhortations read before people approach throughout the Christian world. We learn from the Word that the leading injunction and commandment is to love God before all else and one's neighbour as oneself (<a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">Matthew 22:35-40</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>). Also in the epistles of Paul, there are three things which contribute to salvation, and the greatest of these is charity (<a href="3927/1-corinthians_13_13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Also:<p>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone worships God and does His will, He listens to him, <a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>.<p>Everyone who <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire, <a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-20</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] The exhortations read throughout the Christian world before people approach the Holy Supper show that everywhere they are sternly admonished to be in a state of charity by reconciliation and repentance. I will quote only the following passage from the prayer read to communicants in England:<p>The way and means to become worthy partakers of the Holy Supper is this. First, to examine one's life and conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever one perceives oneself to have offended, either by will, word or deed, there to bewail one's own sinfulness, and to confess oneself to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if one perceives one's offences to be such as are not only against God, but also against the neighbour, then one shall reconcile oneself unto him, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction to the uttermost of one's powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by one to any other; and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offended one, as one would have forgiveness of one's offences at God's hand; for otherwise the receiving of the holy Communion cloth nothing else but increase one's own damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slanderer of His Word, [an adulterer,] or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you of your sins, or else come not to that holy Supper; lest, after taking of that holy Supper, the devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul. <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
</p>
<p>
[4] The third means to the worthy enjoyment of the Holy Supper is faith in the Lord. This is because charity and faith make one, as heat and light do in springtime, so that their combination makes every tree to be reborn. Likewise it is spiritual heat, which is charity, and spiritual light, which is the truth of faith, which make everyone alive. It is established from the following passages that faith in the Lord has this result:<p>He who believes in me will never die, but will live, <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<p>This is the will of the Father, that everyone who believes in the Son should have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>.<p>God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him should have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life. But he who does not believe the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>We are in the truth, in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and everlasting life. <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>

722. VI. THOSE COME TO THE HOLY SUPPER WORTHILY WHO HAVE FAITH IN THE LORD AND CHARITY TOWARD THE NEIGHBOR, THAT IS, WHO ARE REGENERATE. <p>That God, charity, and faith are the three universals of the church, because they are the universal means of salvation, is known, acknowledged, and perceived by every Christian who studies the Word. That God must be acknowledged in order that one may have religion, or that anything of the church may be in him, is declared by reason itself when there is anything spiritual in it; consequently, if one comes to the holy supper without acknowledging God, he profanes it; for he sees the bread and wine with the eye and tastes them with the tongue, while the thought of the mind is, "What is this but a useless ceremony, and how do this bread and wine differ from that on my own table? Nevertheless I partake of them, lest I be charged by the priesthood, and so also by the common people, with the infamy of being an atheist."
</p>
<p>
[2] That after the acknowledgment of God, charity is the second means which enables one to come to the holy supper worthily is evident both from the Word and from the exhortations read before approaching the communion in the whole Christian world. It is evident from the Word in this: <p>That the first command or precept is to love God above all things, and the neighbor as oneself (<a href="3927/matthew_22_34.htm">Matthew 22:34-39</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>). <p>Again in Paul: <p>That there are three things that contribute to salvation, and the greatest of these is charity (<a href="3927/1-corinthians_13_13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). <p>Also from these passages: <p>We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man is a worshiper of God and doeth His will, him He heareth (<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>). <p>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire (<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19, 20</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8, 9</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] It appears also from the exhortations read throughout the whole Christian world before coming to the holy supper. Everywhere men are thus earnestly admonished to be in charity by reconciliation and repentance. From these I will only quote the following passage from the exhortation read to communicants in England: <p>"The way and means" to be worthy partakers of the holy supper "is, first to examine your lives and conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are not only against God but also against your neighbors, then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being likewise ready to forgive others who have offended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offences at God's hand; for otherwise the receiving of the holy communion doth nothing else but increase your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, a hinderer or slanderer of His Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent ye of your sins, or else come not to that holy table; lest, after the taking of that holy sacrament, the devil enter into you as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul."
</p>
<p>
[4] Faith in the Lord is the third means of worthily enjoying the holy supper, because charity and faith make one, like heat and light in spring, from which two conjoined every tree is born anew; so from spiritual heat, which is charity, and from spiritual light, which is the truth of faith, every man has life. That faith in the Lord effects this is evident from the following passages: <p>he that believeth in Me shall never die, but shall live (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:26</a>). <p>This is the will of the Father that everyone that believeth on the Son shall have eternal life (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>). <p>God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should have eternal life (<a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15, 16</a>). <p>He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). <p>We are in the truth, in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). </p>

Therefore, if any of you be a blasphemer of God, a hinderer or slanderer of His Word, [an adulterer], or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent of your sins, or else come not to the Holy Supper; lest, after the taking of the Holy Supper, the devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquity, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul."</p>
<p>
[4] Faith in the Lord is the third means whereby one may worthily obtain the benefits of the Holy Supper, because charity and faith make one, like the heat and light of springtime, from the union of which every tree has new life. In like manner every man lives from spiritual heat, which is charity, and from spiritual light, which is the truth of faith. That faith in the Lord effects this is evident from these passages:<p>"He that believeth in me... shall never die," yet shall he live. <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<p>This is the will of the Father, that every one which believeth on the Son, may have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>.<p>"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him, should have everlasting life" <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>.<p>"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him" <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>"We are in the truth, in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. (A.V., in Him that is truth, even in His Son, Jesus Christ). This is the true God, and eternal life" <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. </p>

722. Quod illi ad Sanctam Coenam digne accedant, qui in fide in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum sunt, ita qui regenerati sunt.<p>Quod Deus, Charitas et Fides, sint tria universalia Ecclesiae, quia sunt universalia media salutis, scitur, agnoscitur et percipitur a quovis Christiano, qui studet Verbo. Quod Deus agnoscendus sit, ut alicui sit Religio, et in illo aliquid Ecclesiae, ipsa Ratio in qua aliquid spirituale est, dictat; quare qui ad Sanctam <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
 Coenam accedit, et Deum non agnoscit, illam profanat, oculo enim videt Panem et Vinum, et lingua gustat illa, at mens cogitat, quid hoc nisi adiaphoron, et quid differunt a similibus <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
super mea mensa, quod tamen facio, ne a Sacerdotio, et inde a vulgo infamiae, quod atheus sim, inculper.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod post agnitionem Dei, Charitas sit alterum medium, quod facit ut quis digne accedat, constat tam ex Verbo, quam ex orationibus praelectis ante accessionem in toto Christiano Orbe; ex VERBO, Quod primarium mandatum et praeceptum sit, ut Deum super omnia ament, et proximum sicut seipsum, <a href="3927/matthew_22_34.htm">Matthaeus 22:34-38</a>, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
<a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luca 10:25-28</a>. Tum apud Paulum, quod sint tria, quae conferunt ad salutem, et quod illorum maxima sit Charitas, <a href="3927/1-corinthians_13_13.htm">1 Corinthios 13:13</a>, ut et ex his, Scimus quod peccatores Deus non audiat, sed si quis Deum colit, et voluntatem Ejus facit, hunc audit, <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">Johannes 9:31</a>. Omnis qui non facit fructum bonum, exscinditur et in ignem conjicitur, <a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthaeus 7:19-20</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luca 3:8-9</a>:</p>
<p>
[3] ex ORATIONIBUS PRAELECTIS ANTE ACCESSIONEM AD SANCTAM COENAM IN TOTO CHRISTIANO ORBE; in illis ubivis serio admonentur ut sint in charitate per reconciliationem et poenitentiam, ex quibus hic solum transcribam haec ex Oratione ad communicantes in Anglia. <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
"Haec est via, et hoc est medium, ut quis fiat dignus particeps Sanctae Coenae: primarium est, ut exploret suae vitae facta et commercia secundum normam praeceptorum Dei; et in quibuscunque animadvertit se offendisse voluntate et loquela, aut factis, tunc deploret vitiosam suam naturam, et confessionem faciat coram Omnipotente Deo, cum pleno proposito emendandi vitam; et si animadvertit offensas ejus esse tales, ut non modo sint contra Deum, sed etiam contra proximum, tunc reconciliabit se illi, et promptus erit ad restitutionem et satisfactionem ex omni potentia sua, propter injurias et mala alicui facta, et similiter <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
promptus erit ad remittendum aliis offensas, quemadmodum vult ut offensae suae remittantur a Deo; alioquin receptio Sanctae Coenae non facit nisi quam aggravet damnationem. Quapropter si quis vestrum est blasphemator Dei, obtrectator et sugillator Verbi Ipsius, [aut adulter,] <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
aut in malitia vel in malevolentia, aut in alio enormi crimine, poenitentiam a peccatis age; si non, ad Sanctam Coenam ne accedas: alioquin post receptionem Sanctae Coenae diabolus intraturus est in te, sicut intravit in Judam, et impleturus te omni iniquitate, et destructurus et corpus et animam."</p>
<p>
[4] Quod Fides in Dominum sit tertium Medium dignae fruitionis Sanctae Coenae, est quia charitas et fides unum faciunt, sicut calor et lux tempore veris, ex quibus duobus conjunctis renascitur omnis arbor; similiter ex calore spirituali, qui est charitas, et ex luce spirituali, quae est <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
veritas fidei, vivit omnis homo. Quod fides in Dominum hoc faciat constat ex his locis, Qui credit in Me, non morietur in aeternum, sed vivet, <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">Johannes 11:25-26</a>. Haec est voluntas Patris, ut omnis qui credit in Filium, habeat vitam aeternam, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">Johannes 6:40</a>. Adeo dilexit Deus Mundum, ut Filium suum unigenitum dederit, ut omnis qui credit in Ipsum habeat vitam aeternam, <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">Johannes 3:15-16</a>. Qui credit in Filium, habet vitam aeternam; qui vero non credit Filio, non videbit vitam, sed ira Dei manet super illo, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">Johannes 3:36</a>. Sumus in veritate, in Filio Dei Jesu Christo; Hic est verus Deus et vita aeterna, <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 Johannes 5:20</a>. <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
