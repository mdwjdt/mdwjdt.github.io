571. Chapter 10: Reformation and Regeneration
<p>Now that repentance has been treated, the next topic in order is our reformation and regeneration. These two both follow our repentance and are moved forward by it.
<p>There are two states that we all inevitably enter into and go through if we are to turn from an earthly person into a spiritual person. The first state is called reformation, the second is called regeneration. In the first state we look from our earthly self toward having a spiritual self; being spiritual is what we long for. In the second state we become someone who is both spiritual and earthly. The first state is brought about by truths (these have to be truths related to faith); through these truths we aim to develop goodwill. The second state is brought about by good actions that come from goodwill; through these actions we come [more deeply] into truths related to faith.
<p>To put it another way, the first state is a state of thought that occurs in our intellect; the second state is a state of love that occurs in our will. As the second state begins and progresses, a change takes place in our minds. There is a reversal, because then the love in our will flows into our intellect and leads and drives it to think in agreement and harmony with what we love. As good actions that come from love take on a primary role, and the truths related to faith are relegated to a secondary role, we become spiritual and are a new creation [<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>]. Then our actions come from goodwill and our words come from faith; we develop a sense of the goodness that comes from goodwill and a perception of the truth that is related to faith; and we are in the Lord and in a state of peace. In brief, we are reborn.
</p>
<p>
[2] If we begin the first state while we are in this world, we can be brought into the second state after we die. If we do not begin the first state while we are in this world, we cannot be brought into the second state or be reborn after we die.
<p>These two states can be compared to the increase of light and heat that occurs as the day progresses in springtime. The first state is like the early light before dawn, when the rooster crows. The second state is like the dawn and the morning. The further development within the second state is like the increase of light and heat as the day progresses toward noon.
<p>These two states can also be compared with the growth of grain crops. In the first stage they are like grass; after that they develop ears or fruiting spikes; and finally the grain itself grows within those structures.
<p>These two states can also be compared with the growth of a tree. It begins as a sprout growing out of a seed in the ground. This then becomes a shoot. Then branches form and are adorned with leaves. Then the tree blossoms and fruit begins to grow in the heart of the flowers. As the fruit grows and develops, it produces new seeds, which are in effect the tree's offspring.
<p>The first state, the state of reformation, can be compared to the state of a silkworm when it draws silky threads out of itself and wraps itself in them. After all its hard work [of transformation], it becomes able to fly in the air and feeds no longer on leaves as before but on the nectar of flowers. </p>

571. CHAPTER TEN<p>REFORMATION AND REGENERATION<p>After dealing with repentance we come next in order to reformation and regeneration, because these come after repentance and it is by repentance that they advance. There are two states which a person must enter upon and undergo to pass from being natural to being spiritual. The first state is called reformation, the second regeneration. In his first state a person looks from his natural to his spiritual man and desires to be spiritual; in the second state he becomes spiritual-natural. The first state is formed by means of the truths which must become part of faith, and these enable him to look towards charity. The second state is formed by the kinds of good which make up charity, and from them he enters into the truths of faith. To put this in other terms, the first state is one of thought on the part of the understanding, but the second is one of love on the part of the will. When this state begins and develops, a mental change takes place; for there is a turning-point, following which the love of the will flows into the understanding, and drives and guides it to think in harmony and in keeping with its love. In so far therefore as the good of love then plays the leading role, and the truths of faith take second place, to that extent he is a spiritual man and a new creature. Then charity inspires his actions, faith his speech; he feels the good of charity and perceives the truth of faith. Then he is in the Lord and in a state of peace, and so he is regenerated.</p>
<p>
[2] Anyone who has begun the first state while in the world can after death be brought into the second. But anyone who has not entered upon the first state while in the world cannot be brought into the second after death, and so cannot be regenerated. These two states can be compared with the advance of light and heat in spring days; the first state can be compared with twilight and cock-crow, the second with morning and dawn; and its development with the day advancing to noon, and so growing in light and heat. It can also be compared with a harvest, which begins with the blade, then grows into awns and ears and finally becomes the wheat in them. Or again with a tree: first it springs from a seed in the ground, then becomes a stalk from which branches come forth; these are decked with leaves, and then it flowers, and the inmost part of the flower is the beginning of the fruit; and as the fruits ripen they produce new seeds as their offspring. The first state, that of reformation, can also be compared with the state of a silk-worm, when it draws silk thread out of itself and wraps itself in it; and after its hard labour is over, it flies out into the air, and feeds, not as formerly on leaves, but on the juices in flowers. </p>

571. CHAPTER 10 <p>REFORMATION AND REGENERATION. <p>After treating of Repentance, Reformation and Regeneration come next in order, because they follow repentance, and by means of it advance step by step. There are two states that man must enter upon and pass through, when from being natural he is becoming spiritual. The first state is called Reformation, and the second Regeneration. In the first man looks from his natural to his spiritual state and longs for that state; in the second state he becomes spiritual-natural. The first state is formed by means of truths, which must be truths of faith, and through these he looks to charity; the second state is formed by means of the goods of charity, and by these he enters into the truths of faith. Or what is the same, the first is a state of thought from the understanding, and the second a state of love from the will. When this latter state begins and is progressing, a change takes place in the mind; the mind undergoes a reversal, the love of the will then flowing into the understanding, acting upon it and leading it to think in accord and agreement with its love; and in consequence so far as the good of love comes to act the first part and the truths of faith the second, man is spiritual and is a new creature; and he then acts from charity and speaks from faith; he feels the good of charity and perceives the truth of faith; and he is then in the Lord, and in peace, and thus regenerate. The man who while in the world has entered upon the first state, after death can be introduced into the second; but he who has not entered into the first state while in the world, cannot after death be introduced into the second, thus cannot be regenerated. These two states may be compared to the progression of light and heat during the days of spring; the first to the dawn or cock-crowing, the second to the morning or sunrise; and the progress of this second state may be compared to the advance of the day to noon, and thus into light and heat. There may also be a comparison with a field of grain, which is at first in the blade, then grows into the ear or head, in which the grain is afterward formed; also with a tree, which first grows out of the ground from a seed, then it becomes a stem from which branches go out, and these are adorned with leaves; at length it blossoms, and from the inmost of the blossoms the fruit begins to form, and this, as it matures, produces new seeds, like a new generation. The first state, which is that of reformation, may also be compared to the state of a silk-worm, when it draws out and evolves from itself filaments of silk, and after finishing its industrious labor, flies forth into the air, nourishing itself, not by leaves as before, but by the juices of flowers. </p>

571. CHAPTER X<p>REFORMATION AND REGENERATION<p>Repentance having been treated of, consideration of reformation and regeneration comes next in their order, for these follow repentance and are promoted by it. There are two states which a man must enter and pass through as he progresses from the natural to the spiritual. The first state is called reformation, and the other regeneration. In the first, a man looks from his natural state towards the spiritual and desires to attain it; in the second, he becomes a spiritual natural man. The first state is formed by means of truths which will belong to faith, and by which he looks towards charity; the second is formed by means of the goods of charity, by which he enters into the truths of faith; or, what is the same thing, the first is a state of thought from the understanding, the other is a state of love from the will. When this state begins, and as it progresses, a change, a complete turn round as it were, takes place in the mind; for the love of the will flows into the understanding, guiding and leading it to think in agreement with its love. Therefore, as far as the good of love plays a leading part in a man's life, and the truths of faith a secondary part, the man is spiritual, and a new creature. He then acts from charity, and speaks from faith; he feels the good of charity, and perceives the truth of faith. He is then in the Lord and in peace, and thus regenerated. A man who in the world has entered upon the first state, can after death be introduced into the second; but he who has not entered upon the first state while in the world, cannot be introduced into the second after death, and thus cannot be regenerated. These two states may be compared to the daily progression of light and heat in the spring; the first to the break of dawn or the end of the last night watch, the second to early morning and sunrise; and the progression of this latter state may be compared to the advance of day to noon, and thus to light and heat. It may also be compared to the corn harvest, which is at first the blade, then the beard and ear, and lastly the corn in the ear; and also to a tree, which first sprouts forth from a seed in the earth. Then it becomes a stalk with branches shooting forth, adorned with leaves and afterwards with blossoms. In the heart of the flowers it begins the formation of the fruits, which as they ripen produce new seeds like a new generation. The first state, which is that of reformation, may also be compared to the state of the silkworm, as it draws forth from itself and spins its threads of silk. After its industrious toil is over, however, it flies forth into the air, and feeds not as before on leaves, but on the juices in flowers. </p>

571. CAPUT DECIMUM<p>DE REFORMATIONE ET REGENERATIONE.<p>Postquam de Poenitentia actum est, sequitur in suo ordine de Reformatione et Regeneratione, quia hae Poenitentiam sequuntur, et per Poenitentiam promovent gradus. Sunt duo Status, quos homo ingressurus et subiturus est, dum a Naturali fit Spiritualis; Primus Status vocatur REFORMATIO, et Alter REGENERATIO; homo in Primo statu a Naturali suo spectat ad Spiritualem, et hunc desiderat; in altero statu fit Spiritualis naturalis; Primus status formatur per vera quae erunt fidei, per quae spectat ad Charitatem; Alter status formatur per bona charitatis, et ab his intrat in vera fidei; seu quod idem est, Primus status est cogitationis ex intellectu, Alter autem est Amoris ex Voluntate; quando hic status inchoat et progreditur, fit mutatio in Mente, nam fit versura, quia tunc Amor voluntatis influit in Intellectum, ac agit et ducit illum ad cogitandum concorditer et congrue suo amori; quare quantum tunc Bonum amoris primas partes agit, et vera fidei secundas, tantum est homo spiritualis, et est nova Creatura, et tunc ex Charitate agit, et ex fide loquitur, et sentit bonum charitatis, et percipit verum fidei, et est tunc in Domino, inque Pace, et sic Regeneratus.</p>
<p>
[2] Homo, qui in Mundo Primum statum inchoavit, ille post mortem potest introduci in Alterum, at qui non in Primum statum in Mundo intravit, ille post mortem non potest in Alterum introduci, ita non regenerari. Duo hi Status comparari possunt cum progressione Lucis et Caloris in diebus tempore veris, Primus cum diluculo seu gallinaceo, Alter cum mane et aurora, et progressio hujus status cum progressione diei ad meridiem, et sic in Lucem et Calorem. Comparari etiam potest cum Messe, quae primum est herba, deinde crescit in aristas et spicas, et postea in his fit frumentum. Tum etiam cum Arbore, quae primum ex semine e terra excrescit, postea fit caulis, e quo exeunt rami, et hi exornantur foliis, et dein efflorescit, et ex intimo florum initiat fructus, qui sicut maturescunt, nova semina, sicut novas proles, producunt. Status primus, qui est Reformationis, etiam comparari potest cum Statu bombycis, quando extrahit ex se et evolvit stamina serici, et post industrium suum laborem evolat in aerem, et se, non ut prius ex foliis, sed ex succis in floribus, nutrit. </p>
