</h4>
<p>
627. Therefore in the church of today, these three - faith, the concept of assigning, and the merit of Christ - are one. They could be called a triune concept, because if any of the three is taken away, the theology of today becomes nothing. Like a long chain hanging on a carefully fastened hook, the theology of today hangs on those three points taken as a single doctrine. If faith or the concept of assigning or the merit of Christ were taken out of the equation, everything that the church says about how we are made just, how our sins are forgiven, and how we are brought to life, renewed, regenerated, and sanctified, and also everything it says about the gospel, free choice, goodwill and good works, and in fact eternal life - all this would be like an abandoned city, or rubble that was once a church building. That leading faith would be nothing and therefore the entire church would be deserted and uninhabited.
<p>These points clarify what the pillars are that are supporting the house of God today. If these pillars were pulled down, the church would collapse like the house where the satraps of the Philistines and some three thousand other people were enjoying themselves. Samson pulled down the two pillars of that house at the same time, so that the Philistines died or were killed (). I say this because, as has been shown above and will be shown in the appendix below, the faith in question is not Christian - it disagrees with what the Word teaches; and it is meaningless to speak of the concept of assigning in connection with that faith, since Christ's merit is not assignable. </p>

627. These three ideas, faith, imputation and Christ's merit, are a single whole in the present-day church. They can be termed three-in-one, for if one of the three were taken away, present-day theology would fall apart, since this depends upon grasping those three as one, like a long chain hanging from a fixed hook. Thus if either faith, or imputation, or Christ's merit, were to be taken away, everything said about justification, the forgiveness of sins, quickening, renewal, regeneration, sanctification, and about the Gospel, free will, charity and good deeds, in fact even about everlasting life - all this would become like deserted towns or the ruins of a church. And faith itself the standard-bearer would be nothing, and so the whole church would become a desert and a desolation.<p>These remarks show plainly what is the column upon which the house of God at the present time is based. If it were pulled away, that house would collapse like the building in which were the rulers of the Philistines and as many as three thousand of the people making merry, when Samson pulled down the two columns at once, and they were killed and met their end (<a href="3927/judges_16_29.htm">Judges 16:29</a>). This can be said because I showed in earlier chapters, and will show in the Appendix, that this faith is not the Christian one, since it is not in keeping with the Word; and that the imputation of that faith is an empty idea, because Christ's merit cannot be imputed. </p>

627. In the present church, then, these three, faith, imputation, and Christ's merit, are one, and they may be called a triune; for if one of these three were taken away, the present theology would be reduced to nothing, since it depends on these three perceived as one, as a long chain on a fixed hook. So if either faith, or imputation, or Christ's merit were taken away, all the things said about justification, the forgiveness of sins, vivification, renewal, regeneration, sanctification, and about the gospel, freedom of choice, charity, and good works, and even life eternal, would become like desolate towns or like a temple in ruins, and faith itself, which stands at the head of all, would come to nothing, and thus the entire church would be a desert and a desolation. All this makes clear upon what a pillar the house of God at this day is made to rest: and if that pillar were torn down the house would be overthrown, like that in which the lords of the Philistines and people to the number of three thousand were amusing themselves, when Samson pulled down both of its pillars at once, and all within it were slain or died (<a href="3927/judges_16_29.htm">Judges 16:29</a>). This is said because it has been shown in what precedes, and will be shown still further in an appendix, that this faith is not Christian, because it is at variance with the Word, and that the imputation which it teaches is absurd, since Christ's merit cannot be imputed. </p>

<p>
627. These three, therefore, faith, imputation and the merit of Christ, are one in the Church to-day, and may be called a trine; if one of the three were taken away, the present theology would cease to be, for it is dependent on the three taken as one, just as a long chain hangs from a hook to which it is fixed. So, if either faith, or imputation, or the merit of Christ were taken away, then all that is said of justification, the remission of sins, quickening, renovation, regeneration, sanctification, and of the Gospel, free will, charity and good works, and indeed of life eternal, would be like desolate cities, or the ruins of a temple; and faith itself, placed in the forefront, would cease to exist, and thus the whole Church would become a desert and a desolation. From this it is evident upon what kind of pillar the house of God at this day is founded. If this pillar were removed the house would fall like the building in which the lords of the Philistines with three thousand of the people were gathered for their amusement. They were all slain, killed when Samson pulled down the two supporting columns, <a href="3927/judges_16_20.htm">Judges 16:20</a>. This is mentioned because it has been shown in the preceding numbers, and will be shown in the Appendix, that this faith is not Christian, because it is at variance with the Word, and that the imputation of this faith is vain, because the merit of Christ cannot be imputed. </p>

627. Sunt itaque illa tria, Fides, Imputatio, et Meritum Christi, in hodierna Ecclesia unum, et vocari possunt triunum, nam si aufertur unum ex illis tribus, fieret Theologia hodierna non aliquid, nam haec a tribus illis ut unum perceptis pendet sicut longa catena ab Unco fixo; prout si auferretur vel fides, vel imputatio, vel meritum Christi, fierent omnia quae dicuntur de Justificatione, de remissione peccatorum, de vivificatione, innovatione, regeneratione, sanctificatione, deque evangelio, de libero arbitrio, de charitate et bonis operibus, imo de vita aeterna, sicut urbes desolatae, aut sicut rudera Templi, et ipsa fides antesignana non aliquid, et sic universa Ecclesia foret desertum et desolatio. Ex his patet, super qua columna Domus Dei hodie fundata est, quae si avelleretur, subrueret illa sicut Domus, in qua fuerunt Satrapae Philisthaeorum et populus ad tria millia ludentes, cujus binas columnas simul Schimson evulsit, qui tunc mortui et occisi sunt, <a href="3927/judges_16_29.htm">Judicum 16:29</a>, <a href="3927/judges_16_30.htm">30</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Hoc dicitur, quia in antecedentibus ostensum est, et in Appendice ostendendum est, quod Fides illa non sit Christiana, quia dissidet a Verbo, et quod imputatio illius fidei sit vana, quia meritum Christi non est imputabile.<p>
