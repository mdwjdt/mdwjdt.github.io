<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>244</b>.教会与对圣言的理解是一致的，因为它与信之真理和仁之良善是一致的，这二者是共性，它们不仅遍及圣言的字义，而且还隐藏其中，如同宝物藏于宝库。包含在圣言字义中的事物向每个人显现，因为它们将自身直接呈于眼前。但藏在属灵之义中的事物只向那些因真理而热爱真理、因良善而行善之人显现。字义所遮盖和保护的宝物向他们敞开。这些良善和真理构成教会的本质要素。</p>

244. 對聖言的理解如何, 教會就如何, 因為教會當與其真理(與信相關的真理)及其良善(與義相關的良善)保持一致, 這二者不僅遍及聖言的全部文字意義中, 而且掩藏在其內, 如同寶物藏于寶庫。
<p>聖言文字意義中的事物向每個人顯現, 因為它們自已直接地顯於眼前。然而隱藏在屬靈意義中的事物只會向那些因真理之真而愛真理,因良善之善而行良善之人顯現, 被文字意義遮蓋和保護的寶貝向他們敞開。良善與真理從本質上構成教會。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
244. The church depends on its understanding of the Word because it depends on true perceptions related to faith and good actions related to goodwill. These true perceptions and good actions are universal characteristics that not only spread out across the entire literal meaning of the Word but also lie hidden within it like valuables in a safe.
<p>The features of the Word's literal meaning are apparent to all of us because they meet our eyes directly. The features that lie hidden in the spiritual meaning, however, are not apparent to any except those who love truths because they are true and who do good things because they are good things to do. The treasures that the literal meaning covers and guards are revealed to these people. These treasures are the things that essentially constitute the church. </p>

</h4>
<p>
244. The reason why the church is like its understanding of the Word is that the church is like its truths of faith and its kinds of good of charity. These are the two universals which are not only scattered around throughout the literal sense of the Word, but also lie hidden within it, like precious objects in treasure-houses. What it contains in its literal sense is plain to any person, since it is directly visible to the eye. But what lies hidden in its spiritual sense is unseen, except by those who love truths because they are true, and do good deeds because they are good. For these people the treasure is displayed, which is hidden and protected by the literal sense. It is these universals which in essence make the church. </p>

</h4>
<p>
244. The church is in accordance with the understanding of the Word because it is in accordance with the truths of faith and the goods of charity, and these two are the universals which not only pervade the whole literal sense of the Word, but are also concealed within it like the precious things in a treasury. The things in the literal sense of the Word are apparent to every man because they present themselves directly to the eye; but the things that lie hidden in the spiritual sense are apparent only to those who love truths because they are truths, and do goods because they are goods. To them the treasure that the literal sense covers and guards lies open. These goods and truths are the essential constituents of the church. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #244 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
244. The nature of the Church is according to the understanding of the Word, because it is according to the truths of faith and the goods of charity; and these two are universals, which are not only scattered throughout the whole of the literal sense of the Word, but which also lie within it like jewels in a treasury. The contents of the literal sense are evident to every man because they appear directly before the eyes; but the contents of the spiritual sense are evident only to those who love truths because they are truths, and who do good because it is good. To those there lies open the treasure which the literal sense conceals and guards; and truths and goods are the essentials which constitute the Church. </p>

244. Quod Ecclesia sit secundum intellectum Verbi, est quia Ecclesia est secundum vera fidei et bona charitatis, et haec duo sunt universalia, quae non modo circumsparsa sunt per totum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
sensum literalem Verbi, sed etiam intus latent sicut pretiosa in thesauris: coram omni homine apparent illa quae in Sensu literali ejus sunt, quia influunt directe in oculos, at quae in Sensu spirituali latent, illa non apparent nisi eis, qui amant vera quia vera sunt, et faciunt bona quia bona; coram his manifestatur thesaurus, quem Sensus literalis tegit et custodit; et haec sunt, quae essentialiter faciunt Ecclesiam.<p>
