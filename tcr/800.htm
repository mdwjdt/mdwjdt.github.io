800. The Dutch in the Spiritual World
<p>In Heaven and Hell I reported that Christian populations where the Word is read and where the Lord is known and acknowledged as the Redeemer and Savior are at the center of all the nations and peoples in the entire spiritual world. The reason for this is that the greatest spiritual light exists among them. That light radiates out from the center into all outlying regions, even the very farthest, as was shown above in 267-272 in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture.
<p>Within this Christian central region, Protestants are assigned particular places depending on how receptive they are to spiritual light from the Lord. Among the Dutch, that spiritual light is more deeply and fully joined to their earthly light, and they are therefore more receptive than others to what is reasonable and rational. As a result, they are given homes within that Christian central region that are in the eastern and southern parts of it. They are in the east to the extent that they have a capacity for receiving spiritual heat, and in the south to the extent that they have a capacity for receiving spiritual light.
<p>(For the points that the regions of the spiritual world are not like the regions in the physical world, that people live in this or that region in accordance with their receptivity to faith and love, and that people who have an exceptionally great amount of love live in the east and people who have an exceptionally great level of understanding live in the south, see <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_141.htm">Heaven and Hell 141-153</a>.) </p>

800. The Dutch in the spiritual world.<p>In my book HEAVEN AND HELL I reported that Christians, who have the Word read to them and who know and acknowledge the Lord, the Redeemer and Saviour, are in the middle of the nations and peoples who make up the whole spiritual world. The reason is that with them the spiritual light is strongest; and it radiates as from a centre towards all the surrounding areas as far as the most distant. How this happens was shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture (<a href="267.htm">267-272</a> above). In this Christian centre the members of the Reformed churches are allotted places in accordance with their ability to receive spiritual light from the Lord. Since the Dutch have this light more deeply and fully infused into their natural illumination, so that they are more disposed than others to receive rational ideas, they have been given dwellings in the east and south of that Christian nucleus. It is their capacity for receiving spiritual heat which locates them in the east, their capacity for receiving spiritual light which locates them in the south. Compass-points in the spiritual world are not like those in the natural world, but the location of dwellings depends upon the way faith and love are received, those in the east excelling in love, those in the south excelling in intelligence; see <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_141.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 141-153</a>. </p>

800. THE DUTCH IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>In the work on Heaven and Hell it is related that the Christians among whom the Word is read among them and there is a knowledge and acknowledgment of the Lord the Redeemer and Savior are in the center of the nations and peoples of the entire spiritual world, because with them there is the greatest spiritual light; and from them as a center light goes forth in all directions to the very boundaries, according to what is shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture (n. <a href="267.htm">267-272</a>). In this Christian center those of the Reformed churches are allotted places according to their reception of spiritual light from the Lord; and because the Dutch have that light more deeply and fully joined in with their natural light than others, and in consequence are more receptive of rational considerations, they are granted dwelling places in that Christian center in the east and south - in the east, because of their capacity to receive spiritual heat, and in the south, because of their capacity to receive spiritual light. In the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_141.htm">141-153</a>) it is shown that the quarters in the spiritual world are not like those in the natural world; and that the dwelling-places according to the different quarters there are dwelling-places in accord with their reception of faith and love, those who excel in love being in the east and those who excel in intelligence in the south. </p>

800. III. THE DUTCH IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.<p>In the work entitled Heaven and Hell it is stated that Christians who read the Word, and who know and acknowledge the Lord, the Redeemer and Savior, are in the centre of all the nations and peoples of the whole spiritual world. For they possess the greatest spiritual light, and the light proceeding from this is diffused as from a centre in all directions to the outermost circumference, as was shown above in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, Nos. <a href="267.htm">267-272</a>. In this Christian centre the Reformed have places allotted to them according to their reception of spiritual light (lux) from the Lord. Because the Dutch have this light more deeply and fully implanted within the light (lumen) of their natural intelligence, and are thus better able than others to receive whatever relates to reason, therefore, in this Christian centre they have obtained homes in the east and south, in the east according to their ability to receive spiritual heat, and in the south according to their ability to receive spiritual light. It may be seen in Heaven and Hell, 141-153, that quarters in the spiritual world are not like those in the natural world. There homes are arranged in quarters according to the reception of faith and love; those having their homes in the east excel in love, and those having their homes in the south excel in intelligence. </p>

800. DE HOLLANDIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI.<p>In Opere de COELO ET INFERNO, relatum est, quod Christiani, apud quos Verbum legitur, ac cognitio et agnitio Domini Redemptoris et Salvatoris est, in Medio Gentium et Populorum totius Mundi spiritualis sint, ex causa, quia maxima Lux spiritualis, apud illos est, et Lux inde sicut a Centro propagatur in omnes peripherias usque ad ultimas, secundum illa, quae in Transactione de SCRIPTURA SACRA supra <a href="267.htm">267-272</a>, ostensa sunt. In hoc Medio Christiano Reformati sortiti sunt loca secundum receptionem Lucis spiritualis a Domino; et quia Hollandi Lucem illam lumini naturali suo penitius et plenius injunctam possident, et inde sunt aliis receptibiliores talium quae rationis sunt, ideo in Meditullio illo Christiano habitationes nacti sunt in Oriente et Meridie, in Oriente ex facultate recipiendi Calorem spiritualem, et in Meridie ex facultate recipiendi Lucem spiritualem. Quod Plagae in Mundo spirituali non sint sicut Plagae in Mundo naturali, et quod habitationes secundum Plagas sint habitationes secundum receptionem Fidei et Amoris, et quod in Oriente sint qui praestant Amore, et in Meridie qui praestant Intelligentia, videatur in Opere <a href="3927/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_141.htm">de COELO ET INFERNO 141-153</a>. </p>
