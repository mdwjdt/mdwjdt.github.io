<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>41</b>.⑷爱和智慧在神里面是一。教会中的智者都知道，爱与仁的一切良善，以及智与信的一切真理皆来自神。人的理性也能看出这是真的，只要它知道爱与智慧的源头是灵界太阳，耶和华神就在这太阳当中，或也可说，它们从耶和华神经由环绕祂的太阳而来。因为那太阳所放射的热本质上是爱，所放射的光本质上是智慧。故由此如大白天一样可清楚看出，爱与智慧在其源头中是一，因而在神里面也是一，因为神是那太阳的源头。这一点可通过世间的太阳来说明：世间的太阳纯粹是火，其火热的属性产生热，其火的光辉产生光；因此，这二者在其源头处是一。<br />但热和光在发出时变得分离，这从它们所作用的事物明显可知。其中，有些事物接受的热相对多一些，有些事物接受的光相对多一些。这种情形尤其体现在人身上，因为人里面的生命之光，就是智慧，和生命之热，就是爱，是分离的。这是因为人必须被改造和重生，而若非生命之光，就是智慧，指示当意愿什么、热爱什么，改造和重生是不可能的。不过，要知道，神不断作工，在人里面将爱与智慧联结起来；然而，人若不注目于神，并信靠祂，就会不断作工使它们分离。于是，这二者，即爱或仁之善与智或信之真越在人里面被联结起来，人就越变成神的形像，越朝着天使所在的天堂被提升并进入其中。另一方面，这二者越在人里面被分离，人就越变成路西弗和龙的形像，从天上被摔到地上，然后堕入地下面的地狱中。这二者的结合所产生的效果是，人的状态变得如同春天的树，此时，热和光均等结合，使得树木发芽、开花、结果。而另一方面，当这二者被分离时，他的状态如同冬天的树，此时，光丧失热，这树变得光秃秃的，树叶凋零、绿色褪去。<br />当属灵之热，就是爱，与属灵之光，就是智慧分离时，或换句话说，当仁与信分离时，人变得如同滋生蛆虫的恶臭或腐烂的土壤，即便长出植物，其叶子也会布满虫子，然后被它们吃光。因为恶爱的诱惑本身是欲望，它们会爆发出来，不受理性的抑制和约束，反而被它热爱、纵容和滋养。总之，神不断努力联结起来的这两样事物，即爱与智慧，或仁与信，其分离好比脸色丧失红润，变得灰白如死人；或好比红润丧失白亮，使得脸色如同燃烧的火把；还好比两个人所缔结的婚约解体，使得妻子变成妓女，丈夫变成奸夫。因为爱或仁就象丈夫，智慧或信就象妻子。当这二者被分离时，属灵的卖淫嫖娼，即对真理的歪曲和对良善的玷污，就会随之而来。</p>

41. (4)仁與智在上帝裡聯合為一。
<p>教會中任何一位智者都知道, 一切與仁愛相關的善和義都由上帝而來, 一切與智慧相關的理和信也都由上帝而來。事實上, 人的理性也能看出這是真的, 只要他們意識到:仁與智源自心靈世界中那個圍繞耶和華上帝的太陽; 或意識到:仁與智通過那圍繞耶和華上帝的太陽,從耶和華上帝而來。從那太陽發出的熱本質上是仁, 發出的光本質上是智。由此可清楚得出, 仁與智在它們的發源之處聯合, 也就是在上帝之中聯合為一, 上帝是那太陽的源頭。
<p>這一點, 可通過這世間的太陽來思考。世間的太陽只不過是火而已。因燃燒釋放熱,還發出光。在最源頭之處, 熱與光是合為一。
<p>[2]然而, 當它們散開時, 就分開了, 熱是熱,光是光。這可從它們對物體產生的效果看出, 有的物體受熱多,有的接受更多的光, 由此可以知道熱與光的分開作用。在我們人身上, 這種分開的作用更明顯, 生命之光與生命之熱是分開作用在我們身上。分開是為了使我們能夠被改造與更新。因為若不是生命之光教導我們什麼當要的和當愛的, 改造和更新就不可能發生。
<p>有必要知道, 上帝持續地為我們裡面的仁與智建立聯合的關係, 但是倘若我們不靠近上帝並信祂, 我們自己就會將二者分開。
<p>這樣的聯合關係越緊密, 與仁相關的善和與智相關的理之間關係越密切, 我們就越變成上帝的形像, 並被提升至天國, 直至天人所在之地。另一面, 這二者在我們裡面分得越開, 我們就越成為路西弗或龍的形像, 從天被摔下地,然後從地扔進地獄。
<p>當仁與智聯合運行在我們裡面, 我們變得如同春天裡的樹木, 發芽,開花並結果。另一面, 當仁與智在我們裡面分開時, 我們就變得如同寒冬裡的樹木, 光中無熱, 所有樹葉凋謝光禿, 樹木蕭條。
<p>[3]當屬靈的熱從屬靈的光撤走時, 或者當義從信撤離時, 我們就變得如同腐爛殖質並且酸化, 蠕蟲在其中繁殖。如果有一點幼苗長出, 苗葉上佈滿吃葉的咀蟲。於是, 愛惡的誘惑(其實是強烈的欲望)在我們裡面迸發。我們的智慧不再控制和收斂這樣的欲望, 而是熱愛它們,關照並滋養它們。
<p>簡單說, 將仁與智,或義與信分開(原本是上帝不斷努力撮合的兩方面)就好比將紅潤從臉上拿走, 變得灰白如死人; 或者將白色從紅色分離,以致於臉紅脹如燃木。
<p>將仁智分離, 也好比撕毀一對夫妻的婚約, 逼女方為娼,迫男方通姦。仁如同一個丈夫, 是義; 智如同一個妻子, 是信。它們的分離導致屬靈的賣淫嫖娼, 其形式就是歪曲真理和污穢良善。 </p>

41. 4. Love and wisdom are united in God. All the goodness of love and goodwill comes from God, and so does all the truth of wisdom and of faith, as any wise person in the church knows. In fact, all human reason is capable of seeing that this is true, once it is aware that love and wisdom originate in the sun that surrounds Jehovah God in the spiritual world; or to put it another way, once it is aware that love and wisdom come from Jehovah God through the sun that surrounds him. The heat radiating from that sun is essentially love, and the light radiating from it is essentially wisdom. From this it becomes as clear as day that love and wisdom are united at their source - namely, God, who is the origin of that sun.
<p>This point can be visualized [by thinking] of the sun in the physical world. It is nothing but fire. Heat radiates from its fieriness; light radiates from the glow of its fieriness. At the outset, then, heat and light are one.
</p>
<p>
[2] As they radiate, however, they are separated, as you can tell from the fact that some objects they strike take in more heat and some more light. A more extreme separation occurs in us. With us, the light of life (intelligence) and the heat of life (love) are distinct. This separation exists because we need to be reformed and regenerated, and this will not happen unless the light of life, or intelligence, teaches us what we should want and what we should love.
<p>It is important to know that God is continually building a partnership between love and wisdom in us, but if we are not facing God and believing in him, we ourselves are constantly separating the two.
<p>The greater the partnership within us, then, between these two things - the goodness of love or of goodwill and the truth of wisdom or of faith - the more we become an image of God and are raised toward heaven and even into heaven where the angels are. On the other hand, the more these two things are separated in us, the more we become an image of Lucifer and of the dragon and are cast down from heaven to earth and then below the earth into hell.
<p>When love and wisdom have a partnership in us, we become like a tree in springtime, when heat joins equally with light to make the tree bud, flower, and bear fruit. On the other hand, when love and wisdom are separated in us we become like a tree in winter, when heat withdraws from light, making the tree bare and bald of all its foliage.
</p>
<p>
[3] When spiritual heat, or love, withdraws from spiritual light, or wisdom, or equally when goodwill withdraws from faith, we become like humus that rots and becomes acidic - worms breed in it, and if seedlings come up at all, their leaves are covered with little leaf-eating grubs. Then enticements to love evil, which are really cravings, burst forth in us. Rather than controlling and restraining them, our intelligence loves them, takes care of them, and feeds them.
<p>In a word, to separate love and wisdom or goodwill and faith - two things God is constantly trying to bring together - is comparable to taking all the redness out of a face so that it becomes as pale as death, or taking all the whiteness away from the redness so that the face becomes as inflamed as a firebrand.
<p>Separating love and wisdom is also comparable to breaking a couples marriage bond and turning the wife into a prostitute and the husband into an adulterer. Love is like a husband, and so is goodwill; wisdom is like a wife, and so is faith. Their being separated causes spiritual prostitution and whoring, in the form of falsifying what is true and contaminating what is good. </p>

<p>
41. (iv) LOVE AND WISDOM ARE ONE IN GOD.<p>Every wise man who belongs to the church knows that all the good of love and charity come from God, and likewise all the truth of wisdom and faith. Human reason can see that this is so, so long as it knows that the source of love and wisdom is the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God, or, what is the same thing, they come from Jehovah God through the sun which surrounds Him. For the heat radiated by that sun is in its essence love, and the light from it is in its essence wisdom. So it is as plain as daylight that in their source love and wisdom are one; consequently in God too, since He is the source of that sun. The sun of the natural world can serve to demonstrate this: it is pure fire, its fiery property producing heat and the brilliance of its fire producing light; so these two are one at their source.</p>
<p>
[2] But in their radiation heat and light become separated, as is shown by the things on which they act, some of which receive more heat and some more light. This is particularly true of people, for in this case the light of life, which is intelligence, is separated from the heat of life, which is love. This is because a person needs to be reformed and regenerated, which is impossible unless the light of life, which is intelligence, shows what ought to be willed and loved. It should, however, be known that God is constantly working to link love with wisdom in a person, though he, unless he looks to God and believes in Him, is constantly working to separate them. Therefore in so far as these two, the good of love or charity and the truth of wisdom or faith, are linked in a person, so far does he become an image of God, and is raised towards and into the heaven where angels live. In the contrary case, in so far as these two are separated in a person, so far does he become an image of Lucifer and the Dragon, and is cast down from heaven to earth, and then into hell beneath the earth. The result of these two being linked is that a person's state becomes like that of a tree in springtime, when heat is evenly combined with light, which produces budding, flowering and fruiting. In the contrary case, when these are separated, his state is like that of a tree in winter, when light loses its heat, and the tree is laid bare and stripped of all its leaves and greenery.</p>
<p>
[3] When spiritual heat, which is love, is separated from spiritual light, which is wisdom, or, in other words, charity is separated from faith, a person becomes like rank or rotting soil, in which maggots thrive; and if it produces shrubs, their leaves are full of grubs which eat them up. For the enticements of the love of evil, which are in themselves longings, burst forth, untamed and unrestrained by intelligence, but rather fostered, pampered and nourished by it. In short, the separation of love and wisdom, or charity and faith, the two things God constantly strives to link, is, to use a comparison, like depriving a face of redness, so producing a pallor as of death; or taking the whiteness away from redness, which makes the face like a blazing torch. It is also like destroying the bond of marriage between a couple, so that the wife becomes a prostitute and the husband an adulterer. For love or charity resembles a husband, wisdom or faith a wife. Their separation brings about spiritual prostitution and fornication, which are the falsification of truth and the adulteration of good. </p>

<p>
41. (4) Love and Wisdom in God make one. Every wise man in the church knows that every good of love and charity is from God, also every truth of wisdom and faith; and human reason is able to see this when it knows that the origin of love and wisdom is the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God, or what is the same thing, that they are from Jehovah God through the sun which is round about Him; for the heat that goes forth from that sun is in its essence love, and the light that goes forth from it is in its essence wisdom. It is therefore as plain as the open day that in that origin love and wisdom are one, consequently are one in God, from whom that sun has its origin. This may be illustrated by the sun of the natural world, which is pure fire, in that from its fire heat goes forth, and from the shining of its fire light goes forth; thus the two in their origin are one.
</p>
<p>
[2] But that these are separated in their going forth becomes evident from their subjects, some of which receive more of heat and others more of light. This is especially true of men in whom the light of life which is intelligence and the heat of life which is love, are separated; and this is done because man needs to be reformed and regenerated, which is impossible unless he is taught by the light of life, which is intelligence, what ought to be willed and loved. It must be understood, however, that God is continually working to conjoin love and wisdom in man; while man, unless he looks to God and believes in him, is continually working to separate them; so far, therefore, as these two, the good of love or charity, and the truth of wisdom or faith, are conjoined in man, so far he becomes an image of God, and is raised up towards and into heaven where angels are; and on the other hand, so far as these two are separated by man he becomes an image of Lucifer and the dragon, and is cast down from heaven to earth, and finally below the earth into hell. From the conjunction of these two, man's state becomes like that of a tree in spring, when heat and light in equal measure are conjoined, whereby the tree buds, blooms, and bears fruit; but on the other hand, by the separation of these two, man's state becomes like that of a tree in winter, when the heat withdraws from the light, whereby the tree is stripped and made bare of all its foliage and verdure.
</p>
<p>
[3] When spiritual heat, which is love, separates itself from spiritual light, which is wisdom, or, what is the same thing, when charity separates itself from faith, man becomes like sour or rotting soil in which worms are bred; and if it brings forth plants their leaves become covered with lice, and are eaten up. For the allurements of the love of evil, which in themselves are lusts, break forth, not being subdued and restrained by intelligence, but loved, fostered, and nourished by it. In a word, to separate love and wisdom, or charity and faith, which two things God constantly strives to bring together, is like depriving the face of its ruddiness, which leaves a death-like pallor, or like taking away the whiteness from the ruddiness, which makes the face like a burning torch. It is also like dissolving the marriage bond between two persons, making the wife a harlot and the husband an adulterer. For love or charity is like a husband, and wisdom or faith is like a wife: and when the two are separated, spiritual idolatry and whoredom follow, which are the falsification of truth and the adulteration of good. </p>

<p>
41. (4) LOVE AND WISDOM IN GOD MAKE ONE.<p>Every wise man in the Church knows that all the good of love and of charity is from God, and likewise all the truth of wisdom and of faith. Human reason can see that this is so, provided it knows that the origin of love and wisdom is from the Sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God, or which is the same thing, that it is from Jehovah God operating through that Sun which encompasses Him. The heat proceeding from that Sun is in its essence love, and the light in its essence is wisdom; it is therefore perfectly clear that love and wisdom are one in virtue of that origin, and consequently in God, from whom that Sun derives its origin. This may be illustrated also from the sun of the natural world, which is pure fire; for heat proceeds from its burning quality and light from its brilliance, and thus both are one in their origin.</p>
<p>
[2] But that they are divided as they proceed is evident from their subjects, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
some of which receive more heat and some more light. This is especially the case with men. Amongst men the light of life, which is intelligence, and the heat of life, which is love, are divided. This happens because man must be reformed and regenerated, which cannot be accomplished unless the light of life, which is intelligence, should teach what he ought to will and to love.<p>Nevertheless it should be known that God continually works for the union of love and wisdom in man, but that man, unless he looks to God and believes on Him, continually works for their separation. Therefore as far as these two, the good of love or charity, and the truth of wisdom or faith, are united in a man, so far he becomes an image of God, and is raised heavenwards and then into heaven, where angels dwell. On the other hand, as far as these two are divided by a man, so far he becomes an image of Lucifer <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
and the dragon, and is cast downwards from heaven to the earth, and afterwards under the earth into hell. From the union of these two principles the state of man becomes like that of a tree in spring-time when heat and light are present equally, causing it to bud, blossom and bear fruit; but from the division of these two the state of man becomes like that of a tree in winter, when heat withdraws from light, causing it to be stripped bare of every leaf and green shoot.</p>
<p>
[3] When spiritual heat, which is love, is separated from spiritual light, which is wisdom, or what is the same thing, when charity is separated from faith, man becomes like ground that is sour or rotten, which breeds worms, and if it produces vegetation the leaves are eaten up by swarming pests. For the allurements of the love of evil, which in themselves are lusts, break forth, and the understanding, instead of subduing and curbing them, loves, pampers and cherishes them. In a word, to divide love and wisdom, or charity and faith, which God continually endeavours to unite, is as it were to rob the face of its ruddiness for the paleness of death, or to deprive it of its white lustre, leaving only the fiery red of a burning brand. Or it is like dissolving the conjugial <sup "fn9_3">3</sup>
tie between two partners, thus making the wife a harlot and the husband an adulterer; for love or charity is like the husband and wisdom and faith like the wife. When these two are separated there ensue spiritual whoredom and adultery, which are falsification of truth and adulteration of good.<p>

41. IV. QUOD AMOR ET SAPIENTIA IN DEO UNUM FACIANT. Omnis Sapiens in Ecclesia novit, quod omne bonum amoris et charitatis sit a Deo, similiter omne verum sapientiae et fidei; quod ita sit, Ratio humana etiam videre potest, dummodo scit, quod origo amoris et sapientiae sit e Sole Mundi spiritualis, in cujus medio <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
est Jehovah Deus, seu quod idem est, quod sit a Jehovah Deo per Solem, qui circum circa Illum est; Calor enim procedens e Sole illo in essentia sua est amor, et Lux inde procedens in essentia sua est sapientia; inde ut in clara die patet, quod amor et sapientia in illa origine unum sint, proinde in Deo, ex Quo origo illius Solis. Illustrari etiam hoc potest, ex Sole Mundi naturalis, qui est purus Ignis, quod ex igneo ejus procedat calor, et quod ex splendore ignei ejus procedat lux, et sic quod utrumque in origine sua unum sit.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod autem in procedendo dividantur, constat ex subjectis, quorum aliqua plus caloris, et aliqua plus lucis recipiunt; hoc imprimis fit apud homines; in his Lux vitae, quae est intelligentia, et calor vitae qui est amor, dividuntur; quod fit ex causa, quia homo reformandus et regenerandus est, et hoc non fieri potest, nisi Lux vitae, quae est Intelligentia, doceat quid volendum et amandum est: sciendum tamen est, quod Deus continue operetur conjunctionem amoris et sapientiae apud hominem, sed quod homo nisi spectet ad Deum, et credat in Ipsum, continue operetur divisionem; quare quantum duo illa, bonum amoris aut charitatis ac verum sapientiae aut fidei, conjunguntur apud hominem, tantum homo fit imago Dei, ac elevatur ad Coelum et in Coelum ubi sunt angeli; et vicissim, quod quantum duo illa dividuntur ab homine, tantum homo fiat imago Luciferi et Draconis, et dejiciatur e Coelo in terram, et dein sub terram in Infernum: ex Conjunctione duorum illorum, fit status hominis sicut status arboris tempore veris, quando calor se ex aequo conjungit cum luce, unde ejus germinatio, florescentia, et fructificatio; at vicissim ex divisione duorum illorum, fit status hominis sicut status arboris tempore hyemis, quando calor a luce recedit, unde ejus denudatio et decalvatio ab omni folio et fronde.</p>
<p>
[3] Quando spiritualis calor, qui est amor, separat se a spirituali luce, quae est sapientia, seu, quod idem est, charitas a fide, fit homo sicut humus acescens aut putrescens, in qua nascuntur vermes, et si producit virgulta, folia illorum implentur pediculis, et consumuntur; illecebrae enim amoris mali, quae in se sunt concupiscentiae, erumpunt, quas Intelligentia non domat et refraenat, sed diligit, educat et nutrit: verbo, dividere amorem et sapientiam, seu charitatem et fidem, quae duo Deus continue conatur conjungere, comparative est sicut orbare faciem rubore, unde pallor sicut mortui, aut auferre candorem a rubore, unde facies fit sicut fax inflammata: et quoque fit sicut vinculum conjugiale solvere inter duos, et facere ut uxor fiat meretrix, et vir adulter; amor enim aut charitas est sicut maritus, ac sapientia aut fides est sicut uxor, et cum duo illa separantur, fit spiritualis meretricatio et scortatio, quae sunt falsificatio veri et adulteratio boni.<p>
