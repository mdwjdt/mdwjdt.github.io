<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>265</b>.古人拥有一部圣言，这从摩西明显看出来，他提到过这部圣言，还从中引用了一些内容（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">民数记21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">27</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.30.htm">30</a>）。这部圣言的历史部分被称为“耶和华战记”，而预言部分则被称为“诗歌”（Enunciations，Utterances）。摩西从该圣言的历史部分引用了下列经文：<br />所以耶和华的战记上说，苏法的哇哈伯与亚嫩河的溪谷，并向亚珥所居之地的下河道谷，是靠近摩押的境界。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">民数记21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.15.htm">15</a>）<br />这部圣言中提到的“耶和华的战争”，和我们圣言中提到的一样，都表示并描述了主即将降世时，祂与地狱争战，并胜过它们。我们圣言的历史部分也有表示并描述同样战争的大量经文，如约书亚与迦南地各民族的战争，以及士师和以色列诸王的战争。<br />从古圣言的预言部分引用了下列经文：<br />所以那些作诗歌的说：你们来到希实本，愿西宏的城被修造、被建立。因为有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏的城，烧尽摩押的亚珥和亚嫩河邱坛的祭司。摩押啊，你有祸了！基抹的民哪，你们灭亡了！基抹的男子逃奔，女子被掳，交付亚摩利的王西宏。我们射了他们，希实本直到底本尽皆毁灭。我们使地变成荒场，直到挪法；这挪法直延到米底巴。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">民数记21:27</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.30.htm">30</a>）<br />译者将这个词译为“箴言作家”（composers of proverbs）或“他们以箴言说话”；不过，应译作“作诗歌的”或“预言诗歌”。这从希伯来语“meshalim”一词的含义可以看出来，这个词不仅指“箴言”（proverbs），还指“预言诗歌”（prophetic utterances）（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">如在民数记23:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.3.htm">24:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.15.htm">15</a>）。在那里，经上说巴兰“题”或“作”他的诗歌，这诗歌其实也是关于主的预言。巴兰的诗歌被称为单数形式的“玛沙”（Maschal）。此外，摩西从这一源头所引用的经文并非箴言，而是预言。<br />这部圣言同样是神性的启示。这从耶利米书明显看出来，那里有几乎一样的话：<br />有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏的城，烧尽摩押的角和哄嚷人的头顶。摩押啊，你有祸了！属基抹的民灭亡了！因你的众子都被掳去，你的众女也被掳去。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.45.htm">耶利米书48:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.46.htm">46</a>）<br />另外，这部古圣言的预言书被称为“雅煞耳书”，或“义人之书”（book of the Upright）。大卫和约书亚都提到过它。大卫提到说：<br />大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗和他儿子约拿单，且吩咐将这歌教导犹大人。这歌名叫弓歌，写在雅煞珥书上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.17.htm">撒母耳记下1:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.18.htm">18</a>） <br />约书亚提到说：<br />约书亚说，日头啊，你要停在基遍；月亮啊，你要止在亚雅仑谷。这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗？（<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.12.htm">约书亚记10:12</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #265 </h4>
<p>
265. 從摩西五經中可看出, 更早期的人們另有聖言存在, 摩西還從中引用了某些內容(<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">民數記21:14-15</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>)。那本聖言的歷史部分被稱為『耶和華戰記』, 而預言部分則被稱為『詩歌』。
<p>下面是摩西從那聖言的歷史部分的引語:所以『耶和華戰記上』說:"蘇法的哇哈伯與亞嫩河的谷, 並向亞珥城眾穀的下坡, 是靠近摩押的境界"(<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">民數記21:14-15</a>)。在那聖言中的『耶和華戰記』, 正如我們聖言中所說的戰鬥, 表達並描述了主降世時與地獄之爭戰以及對地獄的勝利。這同樣的戰鬥也在我們聖言的歷史部分多處提及, 例如約書亞與迦南地各民族的戰鬥, 以及以色列國王和士師進行的爭戰。
<p>[2]下面內容是從古聖言的預言部分引用的:所以那些作詩歌的說:"你們來到希實本, 願西宏的城被修造,被建立。因為有火從希實本發出, 有火焰出於西宏的城, 燒盡摩押的亞珥, 和亞嫩河邱壇的祭司。摩押啊, 你有禍了！基抹的民哪, 你們滅亡了！基抹的男子逃奔, 女子被擄, 交付亞摩利的王西宏。我們射了他們, 希實本直到底本盡皆毀滅。我們使地變為荒場, 直到挪法; 這挪法直延到米底巴"(<a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">民數記21:27-30</a>)。
<p>譯者曾將此處的名字譯作"作諺語的", 不過應當譯作"作詩歌的"或"預言的詩歌", 可明顯從"meshalim"一詞的希伯來文的意思看出——不僅指"諺語", 還有"預言的詩歌"之意(見<a href="3927/numbers_23_7.htm">民數記23:7</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>)。在那裡說到巴蘭"發"他的詩歌, 實際上是關於主的預言。巴蘭的詩歌被稱為"瑪沙", 且是單數; 此外, 摩西所引用的這段並非諺語, 而是預言。
<p>[3]那聖言同樣是神性的啟示。從『耶利米書』的這段, 我們讀到與上面幾乎吻合的文字:有火從希實本發出, 有火焰出於西宏的城, 燒盡摩押的角和哄嚷人的頭頂。摩押啊, 你有禍了！屬基抹的民滅亡了！因你的眾子都被擄去, 你的眾女也被擄去(<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">耶利米書48:45-46</a>)。
<p>大衛和約書亞都提及一卷名為『雅煞耳書』(意為"義人之書")的先知書。
<p>大衛是這樣提到的:大衛作哀歌, 吊掃羅和他兒子約拿單, 且吩咐將這歌教導猶大人。這歌名叫弓歌, 寫在雅煞珥書上"(<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">撒母耳記下1:17-18</a>) 。
<p>約書亞是如此提及:約書亞就禱告耶和華, 在以色列人眼前說, 日頭啊, 你要停在基遍; 月亮啊, 你要止在亞雅侖穀。於是日頭停留, 月亮止住, 直等國民向敵人報仇。這事豈不是寫在雅煞珥書上嗎"(<a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">約書亞記10:12</a>)？ </p>

<p>
265. The works of Moses make it clear that there was a Word among earlier people. Moses cites it and quotes something from it (<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>). The historical part of that Word was called The Wars of Jehovah, and its prophetical part was called The Pronouncements.
<p>From the historical part of that Word, Moses quoted the following:
<p>Therefore it says in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: "I was going to Suphah and the brooks of the Arnon, and the channel of the rivers of water that sloped down where Ar is living and then appears by the border of Moab. " (<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>)
<p>The "wars of Jehovah" in that Word, like the wars in ours, meant and depicted the Lord's battles with the hells and victory over them when he would come into the world. The same battles are meant and depicted in the historical portions of our Word - for example, Joshua's wars with the nations in the land of Canaan and the wars waged by the judges and the kings of Israel.
</p>
<p>
[2] The following is a quotation from the prophetic parts of that Word:
<p>Therefore the Makers of Pronouncements say: "Walk to Heshbon. The city of Sihon will be built and reinforced. For a fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the possessors of the heights of the Arnon. Woe to you, Moab. You have perished, O people of Chemosh. He has given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity to Sihon, king of the Amorites. We killed them with arrows. Heshbon has perished all the way to Dibon, and we devastated [it] all the way to Nophah, which [stretches] all the way to Medeba. " (<a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>)
<p>Translators have rendered the name here as "the Makers of Proverbs," but it ought to be "the Makers of Pronouncements" or "the Prophetic Pronouncements. " This is clear from the meaning of the word meshalim in Hebrew: it means not only proverbs but also prophetic pronouncements. For example, in <a href="3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>, it says that Balaam gave his pronouncement, which was in fact a prophecy about the Lord. His pronouncement is called a mashal, which is the singular. For another thing, the material that Moses quotes from that Word is in fact prophecies, not proverbs.
</p>
<p>
[3] That Word was just as divinely inspired. This is clear from Jeremiah where we read almost identical words:
<p>A fire went out from Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon that consumed the corner of Moab and the top of the children of tumult. Woe to you, Moab. The people of Chemosh have perished. For they have taken your sons into captivity and your daughters into captivity. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>)
<p>Both David and Joshua also mention a prophetic book of the ancient Word called the Book of Jasher ("Book of the Upright Person"). David refers to it thus:
<p>David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan and wrote to teach the children of Judah the bow; look at what was written in the Book of Jasher. (<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>)
<p>And Joshua refers to it thus:
<p>Joshua said, "O sun, stand still in Gibeon. O moon, stand still in the valley of Aijalon. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher?" (<a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>) </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #265 (Chadwick, 1988)

<p>
265. It is established by the books of Moses, who names and quotes from it, that the ancient peoples had a Word (<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>). The historical parts of that Word were called 'The Wars of Jehovah', and the prophetical parts 'The Utterances.' The following is a quotation taken by Moses from the historical parts of that Word:<p>Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah and the rivers Arnon, and the water-channel of the river, which went down, where Ar dwelt and rested towards the boundary of Moab, <a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>.<p>The 'Wars of Jehovah' in that Word, as in ours, meant and described the Lord's battles with the hells and His victories over them, at the time when He was to come into the world. The same battles too are meant and described in many of the historical passages of our Word, as in the wars of Joshua against the nations of the land of Canaan, and in the wars of the Judges and Kings of Israel.</p>
<p>
[2] The following passage is taken from the prophetical parts of the ancient Word:<p>Therefore the authors of Utterances say: Come into Heshbon; the city of Sihon shall be built and strengthened. For fire has gone forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, those who possess the high places of Arnon. Woe to you, Moab; you are done for, people of Kemosh. He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters the captives of the Amorite king Sihon. We have despatched them with arrows. Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon, and we have laid waste as far as Nophah, which is as far as Medeba, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>.<p>The translators render the phrase 'the composers of proverbs', but it ought to be 'the authors of utterances' or 'the prophetic utterances', as is evident from the meaning of the word moshalim in the Hebrew language, which is not only 'proverbs' but also 'prophetic utterances' (as at <a href="3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>). There it is said that Balaam 'gave forth' his utterance; this was a prophecy, also about the Lord. His utterance is called mashal in the singular; moreover, the passages quoted by Moses from this source are not proverbs, but prophecies.</p>
<p>
[3] That Word was likewise divinely inspired, as is plain from Jeremiah, where very similar words occur:<p>Fire has gone forth from Heshbon, and a flame from among Sihon, which has devoured the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of Shaon. Woe to you, Moab; the people of Kemosh is done for, for your sons are taken by force into captivity, into captivity your daughters, <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>.<p>In addition a prophetical book of the ancient Word, called the book of Jashar, that is, the book of the Upright, is mentioned by David and Joshua. In the case of David:<p>David made a lament for Saul and for Jonathan; and he wrote on it, For teaching the sons of Judah the bow. Look, it is written in the book of Jashar. <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>.<p>In the case of Joshua:<p>Joshua said, Be still, sun, in Gibeon, and you, moon, in the valley of Aijalon. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? <a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #265 (Ager, 1970)

<p>
265. That there was a Word among the ancient people, is evident from Moses, who mentions it and took certain things from it (<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14, 15</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>); its historical parts were called "the Wars of Jehovah," and its prophetical parts "Enunciations." From the historical parts of that Word the following is quoted by Moses: <p>Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah and in the streams of Arnon, and the valley of water-courses that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and leaneth upon the border of Moab (<a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14, 15</a>). <p>By the wars of Jehovah in that Word, as in ours, the conflicts of the Lord with the hells, and His victories over them when He was about to come into the world are meant and described. The same conflicts are meant and described in many places in the historical portions of our Word, as in what is said of the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, and the wars of the judges and the kings of Israel.
</p>
<p>
[2] From the prophetical portions of that Word the following passages were taken: <p>Wherefore the Enunciators say, Come ye to Heshbon; let the city of Sihon be built and established; for a fire is gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it hath devoured Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh; he hath given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. We have destroyed them with weapons; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba (<a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>). <p>Translators render this "composers of proverbs" [or "they that speak in proverbs"]; but the rendering ought to be "Enunciators," or "Prophetic Enunciations," as can be seen from the signification of the word Meschalim in the Hebrew tongue, which means both proverbs and prophetic enunciations (as in <a href="3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>), where it is said that Balaam "uttered his enunciation," which was a prophecy that also referred to the Lord. This enunciation is called Maschal in the singular. Moreover, what Moses quotes therefrom is not a proverb but a prophecy.
</p>
<p>
[3] That this Word was in like manner Divinely inspired is evident from Jeremiah, where almost the same things are said: <p>A fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. Woe be unto thee, Moab: the people of Chemosh have perished; for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45, 46</a>). <p>In addition to all this a prophetic book of the ancient Word, called the Book of Jasher or the book of the Upright, is mentioned by David and Joshua; by David as follows: <p>David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan; and he wrote, To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher (<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17, 18</a>). <p>And by Joshua: <p>Joshua said Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon. Is not this written in the Book of Jasher? (<a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12, 13</a>). </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #265 (Dick, 1950)

<p>
265. That a Word existed among the Ancients is evident from the writings of Moses in which he mentions it, and gives quotations from it, <a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>. Its historical parts were called "The Wars of Jehovah," and the prophetical parts, "Enunciations." From the historical parts of that Word Moses quotes the following:<p>"Wherefore it is said in the Book of 'The Wars of Jehovah,' I proceeded to Supha, to the brooks of Amen, and to the water-course of brooks which turned away where Ar is inhabited, and which halted at the border of Moab." <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
(A.V., What he did in the Red Sea-margin, Vaheb and Suphah-, and in the brooks of Amen, And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.) <a href="3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>.<p>By the wars of Jehovah mentioned in that Word, as in ours, are meant and described the Lord's combats with the hells, and His victories over them, when He should come into the world. The same combats are also understood and described in many passages in the historical parts of our Word, as in the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, and in the wars of the Judges and kings of Israel.</p>
<p>
[2] From the prophetical parts of that Word Moses has quoted the following:<p>"Wherefore the Enunciators say (A.V., they that speak in proverbs), Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh! he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon, king of the Amorites. <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
We have shot at them: Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba" <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>.<p>The translators render "Enunciators," "composers of proverbs," but they should be called "Enunciators," and their compositions "prophetical enunciations," as is evident from the signification of the word "Moshalim" in the Hebrew tongue, which means not only proverbs, but also prophetical enunciations; as in <a href="3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; and <a href="3927/numbers_24_3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>. It is there said that Balaam uttered "his enunciation" (A.V., parable), which was also prophetical, concerning the Lord. His enunciation is called "Mashal" in the singular; moreover what Moses quotes are not proverbs, but prophecies.</p>
<p>
[3] That Word, like ours, was Divinely inspired, as is evident from a passage in Jeremiah, where almost the same language is used:<p>"A fire has gone (A.V., shall come) forth out of Heshbon... and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured (A.V., shall devour) the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of Shaon (A.V., of the tumultuous ones). Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken away into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity" <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>.<p>In addition to those Books, mention is made by David and by Joshua of the prophetical Book of the ancient Word, called the Book of Jasher, or the Book of the Upright. David refers to it in the following passage:<p>"David lamented... over Saul and over Jonathan... Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow; behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher" <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>.<p>In Joshua it is mentioned in this passage:<p>Joshua said, "Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon!... Is not this written in the Book of Jasher?" <a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a> [<a href="3927/joshua_10_13.htm">13</a>].<p>

Propterea dicunt ENUNTIATORES: ingredimini Chesbonem; aedificabitur et confirmabitur Urbs Sichonis; nam ignis exivit ex Chesbone, flamma ex urbe Sichonis; comedit Ar Moabi, possessores excelsorum Arnonis: Vae tibi Moabe, periisti popule Kemoschi, dedit filios suos evasores, et filias suas in captivitatem Regi Emorraei Sichoni; cum telis confecimus eos: periit Chesbon usque ad Dibonem, et devastavimus usque ad Nophach, quod usque ad Medebam, <a href="3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numeri 21:27-30</a>. Translatores vertunt PROVERBIORUM COMPOSITORES, sed vocandi sunt ENUNTIATORES seu ENUNTIATA PROPHETICA, ut constare potest ex significatione vocis MOSCHALIM in Lingua Hebraea, quod non modo sint Proverbia, sed etiam Enuntiata Prophetica, ut <a href="3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numeri 23:7</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>, ubi dicitur quod Bileamus ediderit ENUNTIATUM SUUM, quod fuit Propheticum, etiam de Domino, Enuntiatum ejus vocatur MASCHAL in singulari; accedit, quod illa a Mose inde desumpta non sint Proverbia, sed Prophetica.</p>

[3] Quod illud Verbum similiter Divinitus inspiratum fuerit, patet apud Jeremiam, ubi paene similia dicuntur, "Ignis exivit ex Chesbone, et flamma ab inter Sichonem, quae comedit angulum Moabi, et verticem filiorum Schaon: vae tibi Moabe, periit populus Kemoschi, nam rapti sunt filii tui in captivitatem, et filiae tuae in captivitatem," Cap. <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">48:45-46</a>. Praeter illa nominatur Liber Propheticus Verbi vetusti, vocatus LIBER JASCHAR seu Liber Recti, a Davide et a Joschua: a Davide, Lamentatus est David super Schaule et super Jonathane, et inscripsit ad docendum filios Jehudae arcum; ecce scripta in LIBRO JASCHAR, <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>. Et a Josua, "Dixit Joschua, Sol in Gibeone quiesce, et Luna in valle Ajalonis; nonne hoc scriptum in LIBRO JASCHAR," Cap. <a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">10:12-13</a>. <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
