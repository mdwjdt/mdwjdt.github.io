730. The Holy Supper is similar to a covenant; after the terms are agreed upon, it is signed and sealed. The Lord's blood is the covenant, as he himself teaches. When he lifted the cup and gave it to the disciples he said, "Drink from it, all of you; this is my blood of the new testament" (<a href="3927/matthew_26_28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). The new testament means the new covenant. Therefore the Word that was written through the prophets before the Lord's Coming is called the Old Testament or Old Covenant, and the Word written through the Gospel writers and apostles after his Coming is called the New Testament or New Covenant. On the point that blood and also the wine in the Holy Supper mean the divine truth contained in the Word, see the fifth and seventh sections under the second heading of this chapter [706, 708]. The covenant that the Lord has made with us and we have made with the Lord is the Word. The Lord came down as the Word, that is, divine truth. Because his blood is divine truth, the blood in the Israelite church (a church that represented the Christian church to come) was called the blood of the covenant (<a href="3927/exodus_24_8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>), and the Lord was called a covenant to the people (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_9.htm">Psalms 111:9</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] According to the orderly sequence practiced in the world, a signature is absolutely necessary in order to finalize an agreement - a step that comes only after the terms have been worked out. What good is a will or a bequest without a signature? What good is a judicial statement without a signed opinion at the bottom to confirm the judgment? What good is it to be granted national authority if you have no charter to prove it? What good is a verbal offer of a promotion if there is no accompanying letter of confirmation? What good is taking possession of a house if you have no signed agreement of sale with the previous owner? What good does it do to run toward a goal or race for a finish line and a prize if there is no goal or finish line where the prizes will be handed out, and the official has given you no firm indication that he will make good on his promises if you win?
<p>These last analogies have been added solely for the sake of illustration, however, so that everyone including the uneducated will perceive that taking the Holy Supper is like receiving [God's] signature, seal, certificate, or evidentiary letter to prove even to the angels that we have been adopted as God's children; and also that taking the Holy Supper is like being given the key to our home in heaven where we will live forever. </p>

730. The case of the Holy Supper is similar to that of a treaty, which having been agreed and signed is finally sealed. The Lord Himself teaches us that His blood is a covenant, for He said when He took the cup and gave it:<p>Drink of it, all of you. This is my blood, the blood of the new testament, <a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>.<p>The new testament is the new covenant. This is why the Word written by means of the Prophets before the Lord's coming is called the Old Testament or covenant, and the Word written after His coming by means of the Evangelists and Apostles is called the New Testament or covenant. Blood, and likewise wine in the Holy Supper, means the Divine truth of the Word; see above in <a href="706.htm">706</a>, <a href="708.htm">708</a>. The Word too is the actual covenant which the Lord has made with man, and man with the Lord. For the Lord came down as the Word, that is, as Divine truth. It is because this is His blood, that blood in the Israelite church, which represented the Christian church, was called 'the blood of the covenant' (<a href="3927/exodus_24_8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>) and the Lord was called 'the Covenant of the people' (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_9.htm">Psalms 111:9</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] It is in keeping with the way things are arranged in the world, that there should be a signing as a guarantee, and this follows discussion of the terms. How can anyone have a commission or a will without a signature? How can one have a judgment without a signed decision to make it effective? How can one reach high office in a kingdom without letters patent? How can one get advancement to any office without written confirmation? How can one own a house without a bill of sale or an agreement with the owner? How can one advance towards an end or chase after a goal and so win a prize, unless there is some end or goal where the prize may be won? Or unless the presiding officer has somehow confirmed his offer? These last examples are only added as an illustration to enable even a simpleminded person to grasp that the Holy Supper is a kind of guarantee, seal, token and evidence of commission, to show, even in the sight of angels, that they are sons of God. It is in addition like a key to a home in heaven, where they may reside for ever. </p>

730. It is with the holy supper as with a covenant, which, after the articles of agreement are settled, is drawn up and finally executed with a seal. That the Lord's blood is a covenant, He Himself teaches; for when He took the cup and gave it, He said: <p>Drink of it, all of you; for this is My blood of the new testament (<a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">Matthew 26:27, 28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). <p>"The new testament" means the new covenant; therefore the Word written by the prophets before the Lord's coming is called the Old Testament or Covenant, while that written after His coming by the evangelists and apostles is called the New Testament or Covenant. That "blood" as well as the wine of the holy supper means the Divine truth of the Word can be seen above (n. <a href="706.htm">706</a>, <a href="708.htm">708</a>), and the Word is the covenant itself which the Lord made with man and man with the Lord; for the Lord descended as the Word, that is, as Divine truth; and as this is His blood, so in the Israelitish church, which was representative of the Christian church, blood is called, <p>The blood of the covenant (<a href="3927/exodus_24_7.htm">Exodus 24:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>); <p>And the Lord a covenant of the people (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_9.htm">Psalms 111:9</a>). <p>Moreover, it is in accordance with order in the world that there should be by all means a signature, in order that there may be some certitude, and that it should follow after deliberate action. What is a commission or a will without the signature? What is a legal decision without a decree signed to ratify the decision? What is a high office in a kingdom without a commission? What is promotion to any office if it is not confirmed? What is the possession of a house without purchase or agreement with the owner? What is progression to an end, or running to a goal, and thus for a reward, if there is no end or goal where the reward is to be gained; or if the judge has not in some manner made the wager sure? But these last have been added merely for the sake of illustration, that even the simple may see that the holy supper is like a signature, a seal, a badge, or a proof of appointment even to the angels, that those who come to it worthily are sons of God; and it is also like a key to the house in heaven where they are to dwell forever. </p>

730. The Holy Supper is like a covenant, which is ratified after the articles are settled, and is finally signed and sealed. That the Lord's blood is a covenant He Himself teaches; for when He took the cup and gave it to His disciples, He said:<p>"Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament." <a href="3927/matthew_26_1.htm">Matthew 26</a> [<a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">27</a>], <a href="3927/matthew_26_28.htm">28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>.<p>The new testament is the new covenant; therefore, the Word written by the prophets before the Lord's coming is called the Old Testament and Covenant, and the Word written by the evangelists and apostles after His coming is called the New Testament, that is, the New Covenant. That the Divine Truth of the Word is meant by blood, and likewise by the wine in the Holy Supper, may be seen above in Article II, <a href="706.htm">706</a>, <a href="708.htm">708</a>. Now the Word is the covenant itself which the Lord made with man, and man with the Lord. For the Lord descended as the Word, that is, as the Divine Truth; and as this is His blood, therefore, in the Israelitish Church, which was representative of the Christian Church, blood was called:<p>"the blood of the covenant," <a href="3927/exodus_24_8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>; and the Lord "the covenant of the people" <a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_9.htm">Psalms 111:9</a>.<p>It is, moreover, quite in accordance with the order observed in the world that a covenant, to be secure and binding, should be signed and sealed, after the terms have been duly considered. What is a commission, or a will, without a seal? What is the decision of a judge unless his opinion is written down and signed that it may be ratified? What is a high office in a kingdom, without a warrant? What is promotion to any post, without a note of confirmation? What is the possession of a house, without a deed of sale, or a deed of agreement with the owner? What avails progression to any end, or a race to any goal for a prize, if there is no end or goal where the prize may be obtained, and if the proper official has not assured the promised reward? These last things are mentioned only by way of illustration, in order that men of even simple intelligence may realize that the Holy Supper is like the signing, the sealing, the certifying and the witnessing of an undertaking in the presence of the angels, that they are sons of God; and, moreover, that the Holy Supper is, as it were, the key to the mansion in heaven where they will dwell forever. </p>

[2] Quod omnino obsignatio debeat esse, ut sit aliqua certitudo, et quod illa sequatur post Acta deliberata, est quoque secundum ordinem in Mundo: quid Legatio et Testamentum absque obsignatione: quid Judicatio absque Sententia subscripta, ut judicium ratum sit: quid eminens administratio in Regno absque diplomate: quid promotio ad aliquod officium absque confirmatione: quid possessio Domus absque emtione, aut conventione cum possessore: quid progressio ad aliquem finem, aut cursitatio ad aliquam metam, et sic ad praemium, si non aliquis finis aut meta est, ubi praemium reportabit, et nisi Praetor sponsionem suam aliquo modo stabilivit.
