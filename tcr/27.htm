<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">神的无限，或祂的无垠和永恒</h4><br />27.尘世有两个特有的属性使得其中万物成为有限：一为空间，一为时间。由于尘世由神所造，并且空间和时间连同它一起被造，致使其成为有限，故有必要讨论它们的两个起点，即无垠和永恒。因为神的无垠与空间相关，神的永恒与时间相关，而祂的无限则包含无垠和永恒这二者。但由于无限超越有限，它不是有限的心智所能理解的，只能允许其在某种程度上对它有所理解力，故要认真讨论下列要点：<br />⑴神是无限，因为祂是存在和彰显本身，宇宙万物皆通过祂而存在和彰显。<br />⑵神是无限，因为祂在世界，因而在空间和时间产生之前就已存在。<br />⑶自创世之时，神就在空间中，却无关空间，在时间中，却无关时间。<br />⑷相对于空间的无限被称为无垠，而相对于时间的无限则被称为永恒。尽管它们如此关联，但神的无垠之中丝毫没有空间，祂的永恒之中丝毫没有时间。<br />⑸世上有众多事物能使被启示的理性看到神创造者的无限。<br />⑹一切受造物都是有限的，无限在有限事物里面，如同在自己的容器中，在人里面则如同在自己的形像中。<br />现逐一解读上述要点。</p>

27. 上帝的無限, 或祂的無垠和永恆
<p>物質世界的兩樣屬性令到其中萬物成為有限:一個是空間, 另一個是時間。物質世界由上帝創造, 空間與時間同時被造而致使物質世界為有限。有必要討論一下空間與時間的兩個源頭, 就是無垠和永恆。上帝的無垠與空間相關聯, 祂的永恆與時間相關聯。而無垠與永恆兩者都包含在無限之內。不過, 因為無限超越有限, 無限的知識超越有限的頭腦。要使有限的頭腦能一定程度上感知無限, 可按下列順序仔細斟酌:
<p>(1)上帝是無限, 因為祂是根本自身和表現自身, 宇宙萬物的根本和表現由祂而來。
<p>(2)上帝是無限, 祂在世界之先, 因而在空間和時間出現之先。
<p>(3)自上帝造了世界, 祂就獨立於空間之外而在空間裡, 獨立於時間之外而在時間裡。
<p>(4)與空間相關的無限被稱為無垠, 與時間相關的無限被稱為永恆。儘管如此關聯, 上帝的無垠之中沒有空間, 祂的永恆之中沒有時間。
<p>(5)在世上眾多事物中藉著被啟發的理性能看見上帝創造者的無限。
<p>(6)所有被造物有限, 無限在有限事物之中, 如同在其接受容器之中; 在人之中尤如在其形像之中。 </p>

27. The Infinity of God:
<p>His Immensity and Eternity
<p>Two properties of the physical world limit all things in it: one is space and the other is time. Because God created this world and concurrently created space and time as limitations on it, I need to discuss the origins of space and time; namely, immensity and eternity. God's immensity relates to space and his eternity relates to time. Infinity includes both immensity and eternity.
<p>Infinity transcends what is finite. A concept of infinity is therefore beyond the finite mind. To give at least some sense of it, I will discuss it in the following sequence:
<p>1. God is infinite because he is intrinsic reality and manifestation, and all things in the universe have reality and manifestation from him.
<p>2. God is infinite because he existed before the world - before space and time came into being.
<p>3. Ever since he made the world, God has existed in space independently of space, and in time independently of time.
<p>4. Infinity in relation to space is called immensity; in relation to time it is called eternity. Yet although these are related, there is nonetheless no space in God's immensity, and no time in his eternity.
<p>5. From many things in the world, enlightened reason can see the infinity of God the Creator.
<p>6. Every created thing is finite. The Infinite is in finite objects the way something is present in a vessel that receives it; the Infinite is in people the way something is present in an image of itself.
<p>I need to explain these statements separately. </p>

27. THE INFINITY OR THE IMMENSITY AND THE ETERNITY OF GOD<p>There are two properties peculiar to the natural world which make everything in it finite. One is space, the other time. Because that world was created by God, and spatial distances and periods of time were created along with it and serve to define it, their two starting-points, immensity and eternity, need to be discussed. For the immensity of God relates to space, and His eternity to time, while His infinity embraces both immensity and eternity. But since infinity transcends the finite, and it is beyond the finite mind to grasp it, to permit some sort of perception of it, the following series of propositions will be discussed:<p>(i) God is infinite, because He is and comes into being in Himself, and everything in the universe is and comes into being from Him.<p>(ii) God is infinite, because He existed before the world did, and thus before space and time came into existence.<p>(iii) Since the making of the world God is non-spatially in space and non-temporally in time.<p>(iv) The infinity [of God] as predicated of space is called immensity, and as predicated of time is called eternity. Despite these predications His immensity is totally devoid of space and His eternity is totally devoid of time.<p>(v) There is much in the world which can enable enlightened reason to see the infinity of God the Creator.<p>(vi) Every created object is finite, and the infinite is contained in finite objects as in receivers, and in human beings as images of it. These propositions will be explained one by one. </p>

27. THE INFINITE OF GOD OR HIS IMMENSITY AND ETERNITY <p>There are two properties of the natural world which cause all things of it to be finite; one is space, and the other time. And as the natural world was created by God, and space and time were created together with it and render it finite, it is necessary to treat of the two origins of these properties, namely, Immensity and Eternity; for the immensity of God relates to spaces and His eternity to times; while both immensity and eternity are included in Infinity. But because the infinite transcends the finite, and because a knowledge of the infinite transcends the finite mind, to render it in some measure conceivable it shall be carefully considered in the following order: <p>(1) God is Infinite because He is Being and Existence in Himself, and because all things in the universe have their being and existence from Him. <p>(2) God is Infinite because He was before the world was, thus before spaces and times arose. <p>(3) Since the creation of the world God is in space without space, and in time without time. <p>(4) In relation to spaces Gods Infinity is called Immensity, while in relation to times it is called Eternity; but although they are so related there is nothing of space in His Immensity and nothing of time in His Eternity. <p>(5) The Infinity of God can be seen by enlightened reason in very many things in the world. <p>(6) Every created thing is finite, and the Infinite is in finite things as in its receptacles, and is in men as in its images. <p>These propositions shall be explained one by one. </p>

27. THE INFINITY OF GOD, OR HIS IMMENSITY AND ETERNITY.<p>There are two things peculiar to the natural world which cause all things there to be finite: one is space and the other is time; and because that world was created by God, and space and time were created together with it, and make it finite, the sources from which these two things are derived, namely immensity and eternity, will now be treated, for the immensity of God has relation to space, His eternity to time, and His infinity comprehends both immensity and eternity. Because infinity transcends the finite, and any knowledge of it transcends the finite mind, therefore, in order that some perception of it may be obtained, it will be treated in the following series:<p>(1) God is infinite, because He is and exists in Himself, and all things in the universe are and exist from Him.<p>(2) God is infinite, because He was before the world, and thus before space and time arose.<p>(3) God, since the world was created, is in space apart from space, and in time apart from time.<p>(4) Infinity in relation to space is called immensity, and in relation to time, eternity; and although these relations exist, yet there is nothing of space in His immensity, and nothing of time in His eternity.<p>(5) Everyone of enlightened reason, from very many things in the world, may see the infinity of God the Creator.<p>(6) Every created thing is finite, and the infinite is in finite things as in its receptacles, and in men as in its images.<p>An explanation of each of these articles will now be given. </p>

27. DE DEI INFINITATE, SEU IMMENSITATE ET AETERNITATE.<p>Sunt duo Propria Mundi naturalis, quae faciunt ut omnia ibi finita sint; unum est SPATIUM, et alterum est TEMPUS; et quia Mundus ille creatus est a Deo, et una cum illo Mundo creata sunt Spatia et Tempora, et haec finiunt illum, ideo de duobus initiis illorum, quae sunt IMMENSITAS ET AETERNITAS, agendum est; Immensitas Dei enim se refert ad Spatia, ac Aeternitas ad Tempora, et INFINITAS comprehendit et Immensitatem et Aeternitatem. At quia Infinitas transcendit finitum, et cognitio illius Mentem finitam, ideo ut aliquo modo percipiatur, de illa in hac serie transigendum est. I. Quod Deus, quoniam Est et Existit in se, et omnia in Universo sunt et existunt ex Ipso, Infinitus sit: II. Quod Deus, quoniam ante Mundum fuit, ita antequam Spatia et Tempora orta sunt, sit Infinitus. III. Quod Deus, postquam Mundus factus est, sit in Spatio absque Spatio, et in Tempore absque Tempore: IV. Quod Infinitas Dei respective <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ad Spatia dicatur Immensitas, et respective ad Tempora, dicatur Aeternitas, et quod tametsi hi respectus sunt, usque nihil Spatii in Ipsius Immensitate, et nihil Temporis in Ipsius Aeternitate sit. V. Quod illustrata Ratio ex permultis in Mundo videre possit Infinitatem Dei Creatoris. VI. Quod omne creatum sit finitum, et quod Infinitum sit in finitis ut in receptaculis, et quod in hominibus ut in suis imaginibus. Sed haec singulatim explicabuntur.<p>
