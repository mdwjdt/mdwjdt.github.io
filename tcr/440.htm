<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>440</b>.然而，人若想着去天堂，并认为应为此行善，就不是以回报为目的，也并非将功劳归于行为，因为那些爱邻如己且爱神胜过一切的人也是这样想的。他们的这种想法来自他们对主所说的话的信心：他们在天上的赏赐是大的（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.11.htm">马太福音5:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.1.htm">6:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.41.htm">10:41</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.42.htm">42</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.23.htm">路加福音6:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.12.htm">14:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.36.htm">约翰福音4:36</a>）；如此行善之人，将承受那创世以来为他们所预备的国（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">马太福音25:34</a>）；并要照各人的行为报应各人（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">马太福音16:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.29.htm">约翰福音5:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.13.htm">启示录14:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.14.htm">耶利米书25:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.19.htm">32:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.9.htm">何西阿书4:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.6.htm">撒迦利亚书1:6</a>等等）。这些人并不认为赏赐是基于自己的功劳，而是相信恩典的承诺。他们的赏赐就是对邻行善的快乐。这就是天堂中的天人所感受的快乐，这快乐是永恒的属灵快乐，它无限超越一切属世的快乐。享有这种快乐的人不愿听到谈论什么功劳，因为他们喜欢这样做，并且在做的过程中感到十分开心。为了回报而这样行的想法会使他们感到沮丧。他们就像那些为友谊而善待朋友、为兄弟情谊而善待兄弟、为妻儿而善待妻儿、为国家而善待国家之人，所以他们出于友谊和爱行事。他们若行了善事，也会说并使别人相信，他们不是为了自己这样做，而是为了别人。</p>

440. 然而另一方面, 人若想著去天國, 並決心因此而應當行善, 就不是以回報為主要目的, 也不將功勞歸給自己所做的行為。愛鄰舍如己並愛主勝過其它一切的人們有如此思想, 因為他們相信主說的:他們在天國的回報是大的(<a href="3927/matthew_5_11.htm">馬太福音5:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_6_1.htm">6:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_41.htm">10:41-42</a>;<a href="3927/luke_6_23.htm">路加福音6:23</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>;<a href="3927/john_4_36.htm">約翰福音4:36</a>)。如此行善事之人, 將承受那創世以來為他們所預備的國度(<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">馬太福音25:34</a>); 並要照各人的行為報應各人(<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">馬太福音16:27</a>;<a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">約翰福音5:29</a>;<a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">啟示錄14:13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12-13</a>;<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">耶利米書25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>;<a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">何西阿書4:9</a>;<a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">撒迦利亞書1:6</a>;以及其它地方)。這些人並不信任靠自己功勞而獲得獎賞, 而相信這是來自恩典的承諾。
<p>對鄰舍行善的快樂就是對他們的獎賞。天國中的天人感受著這樣的快樂, 這是屬靈的快樂; 這樣的快樂是永恆的快樂, 而且不可測度地超越世上任何一種快樂。享受如此快樂之人不願意聽到談論什麼功勞, 因為他們行善令他們感到快樂。如果他們認為自己是為了回報而行善, 會感到沮喪。他們就像那些為友誼而益朋友,為兄弟情誼而益兄弟,為妻兒而益妻兒,為國而益國家之人, 出於友誼和愛而行動。當他們行了善舉時, 他們還會滿有信心地肯定, 這樣做並非為了自己, 而是為了別人。 </p>

440. On the other hand, if people think about going to heaven and decide that they should therefore do what is good, this is not the same as making rewards their main goal or taking credit for their good deeds. People who love their neighbor as themselves and love God above all else have these thoughts because they have faith in the Lord's words that their reward will be great in heaven (<a href="3927/matthew_5_11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_6_1.htm">6:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_41.htm">10:41-42</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_23.htm">Luke 6:23</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>; <a href="3927/john_4_36.htm">John 4:36</a>); that people who do good things are going to possess as an inheritance a kingdom prepared since the founding of the world (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>); and that all are paid back for what they have done (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; and elsewhere). What these people have is not confidence in a reward because they deserve it; they have faith in the promise of grace.
<p>The pleasure of doing good to their neighbor is their reward. The angels in heaven feel this pleasure. It is a spiritual pleasure that is eternal. It immeasurably surpasses every earthly pleasure. People who have this pleasure do not want to hear about getting credit - they love doing good and feel joy in it. It depresses them if someone thinks they are doing it to get something in return. They are like people who benefit their friends for friendship's sake; who benefit their siblings for their siblings' sake; who benefit their spouse and children for their spouse's and children's sake; who benefit their country for their country's sake - people whose actions are based on friendship and love. People who do these good things state with conviction that they did not do it for themselves; they did it for the others. </p>

440. However, thinking about going to heaven, and good needing to be done for this reason, is not regarding reward as one's aim and attributing merit to deeds, for so too do those think who love the neighbour as themselves, and God above all things. For they think this, trusting in the Lord's words, that their reward will be great in the heavens (<a href="3927/matthew_5_11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_6_1.htm">6:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_41.htm">10:41-42</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_23.htm">Luke 6:23</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>; <a href="3927/john_4_36.htm">John 4:36</a>); that those who have done good deeds will possess as their inheritance the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>); and that each person will be repaid according to his deeds (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; and elsewhere). These people do not trust in getting a reward by their merit, but believe it is promised them by grace. Their reward is the pleasure of doing good to the neighbour. The angels in heaven enjoy this pleasure, and it is a spiritual pleasure, which is everlasting and immeasurably exceeds any natural pleasure, Those who enjoy that pleasure are unwilling to listen to talk of merit, for they like to act, and that is what makes them feel pleased. They are saddened if they think that their actions are done for the sake of being repaid. They are like those who do good to their friends for friendship's sake, to their brother for brotherhood's sake, to their wife and children for their wife's and children's sakes, to their country for their country's sake, so that they act from friendship and love. When they do a kindness, they also say and convince others that it is not for themselves but for others. </p>

440. But to think about getting into heaven, and that good ought to be done for that reason, is not to regard reward as an end and to ascribe merit to works; for thus do those also think who love the neighbor as themselves and God above all things; so thinking from faith in the Lord's words, <p>That their reward should be great in the heavens (<a href="3927/matthew_5_11.htm">Matthew 5:11, 12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_6_1.htm">6:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_41.htm">10:41, 42</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_23.htm">Luke 6:23</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>; <a href="3927/john_4_36.htm">John 4:36</a>); <p>That those who have done good shall possess as an inheritance a kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>); <p>That everyone is rewarded according to his works (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12, 13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a> and elsewhere). <p>Such do not trust to reward on the ground of their merit, but have faith in the promise from grace. With such the delight of doing good to the neighbor is their reward. This is the delight of the angels in heaven, and it is a spiritual delight which is eternal, and immeasurably exceeds all natural delight. Those who are in this delight are unwilling to hear of merit, for they love to do, and in doing they perceive blessedness. They are sad when it is believed that they work for the sake of recompense. They are like those who do good to friends for the sake of friendship, to brethren for the sake of brotherhood, to wife and children for the sake of wife and children, and to their country for their country's sake; thus from friendship and love. Those who do acts of kindness also say and give evidence that they are doing this not on their own behalf, but on behalf of the others. </p>

440. However, to think that men go to heaven, and that good is to be done for that reason, is not to regard reward as an end, and to place merit in works. For even those who love the neighbor as themselves, and God above all things, think in this way. This they do from a belief in the words of the Lord:<p> their reward shall be great in heaven, <a href="3927/matthew_5_11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_6_1.htm">6:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_41.htm">10:41-42</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_23.htm">Luke 6:23</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_12.htm">14:12-14</a>; <a href="3927/john_4_38.htm">John 4:38</a>; that those who have done good shall inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world, <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>;<p>that every man shall be rewarded according to his works, <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; and in other places.<p>Such persons do not put their trust in any reward on account of their merit; but they have a belief in the promise from grace. With them the delight of doing good to the neighbor is a reward, and this is the delight of the angels in heaven; for it is a spiritual delight, and eternal, and infinitely surpasses every natural delight. Those who are in the enjoyment of this delight have no desire to hear of merit, for their joy is in doing, and they find true blessedness therein; and they are grieved if it should be believed that they are acting for the sake of reward. They are like those who do good to their friends for friendship's sake; to a brother, because he is a brother; to a wife and children, because they are wife and children; to their country, for their country's sake; and thus they act from friendship and love. <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
