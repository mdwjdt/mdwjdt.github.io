<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>262</b>.主应验了圣言的全部。这从经上说“主成全了律法和经文，这一切的事成就了”明显可知。如，在这些地方，耶稣说：<br />莫想我来要废掉律法和先知；我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.17.htm">马太福音5:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.18.htm">18</a>）<br />耶稣进了会堂，站起来要念经。有人把先知以赛亚的书交给祂，祂就打开，找到一处写着说：主的灵在我身上，因为祂用膏膏我，叫我传福音给贫穷的人，医治心碎的人，传福音使被掳的得释放，瞎眼的得看见，报告主悦纳人的禧年。于是祂把书卷起来说，今天这经应验在你们耳中了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.16.htm">路加福音4:16</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这是要应验经上的话，同我吃饭的人，举起脚跟来踢我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.18.htm">约翰福音13:18</a>）<br />其中除了那灭亡之子，没有一个灭亡的，好叫经上的话得应验。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.12.htm">约翰福音17:12</a>）<br />这要应验祂所说的圣言，你所赐给我的人，我没有失落一个。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.9.htm">约翰福音18:9</a>）<br />耶稣对彼得说，收刀入鞘吧！若是这样，经上所说事情必须如此的话怎么应验呢？但这一切的事成就了，为要应验经上的话。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.52.htm">马太福音26:52</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.54.htm">54</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.56.htm">56</a>）<br />人子必要去世，正如经上指着祂所写的，为要应验经上的话。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.21.htm">马可福音14:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.49.htm">49</a>）<br />这就应了经上的话说，祂被列在罪犯之中。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.28.htm">马可福音15:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.37.htm">路加福音22:37</a>）<br />这要应验经上的话说，他们彼此分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.24.htm">约翰福音19:24</a>）<br />这事以后，耶稣知道各样的事已经成了，为要使经上的话应验。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.28.htm">约翰福音19:28</a>）<br />当耶稣受了那醋，就说，成了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.30.htm">约翰福音19:30</a>）<br />这些事成了，为要应验经上的话说，他的骨头，一根也不可折断。经上又有一句说，他们要仰望自己所扎的人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.36.htm">约翰福音19:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.37.htm">37</a>）<br />整本圣言都是指着主写的，祂降世是要应验它。对此，主在离开之前，还以这些话教导祂的门徒：<br />耶稣对他们说，无知的人哪，先知所说的一切话，你们的心信得太迟钝了。基督受这些苦，又进入祂的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？于是从摩西和众先知起，凡经上所指着自己的话，都给他们讲解明白了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.25.htm">路加福音24:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.27.htm">27</a>）<br />耶稣又说：<br />摩西的律法，先知的书和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话，都必须应验。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.44.htm">路加福音24:44</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.45.htm">45</a>）<br />祂在世时应验了圣言的一切事，甚至直至最细微的细节。这从祂的话明显可知：<br />我实在告诉你们，就是天地都废去了，一点或一钩也决不能从律法书上废去；直到一切都实现。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.18.htm">马太福音5:18</a>）<br />由此可见，主应验律法的一切事并不是指祂应验十诫的一切诫命，而是应验圣言的一切事。“律法”就表示圣言的一切事，这一点从以下经文可以看出来：<br />耶稣说，你们的律法上岂不是写着，我曾说你们是神吗？（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.34.htm">约翰福音10:34</a>，诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗82.6.htm">82:6</a>）<br />众人回答说，我们从律法上听说，基督是永存的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.34.htm">约翰福音12:34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.34.htm">诗篇89:34</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.37.htm">37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.4.htm">110:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">但以理书7:14</a>）<br />为应验写在他们律法上的圣言，他们无故地恨我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.25.htm">约翰福音15:25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗35.19.htm">诗篇35:19</a>）<br />天地废去比律法的一点一画落空还容易。（路加福音16 ：17）<br />在这句经文中，“律法”和别处频繁提到的一样，表示整部圣经。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #262 </h4>
<p>
262. 主應驗了聖言中的一切, 這個事實可從一些經文看出, 說祂應驗(或成全)了律法和經書, 並完成了其中的所有事情。例如, 耶穌說:"莫想我來要廢掉律法和先知; 我來不是要廢掉, 乃是要成全(或應驗)"(<a href="3927/matthew_5_17.htm">馬太福音5:17-18</a>)。祂進了會堂, 站起來要念。有人把先知以賽亞的書交給祂, 祂就打開, 找到一處寫著說:"主的靈在我身上, 因為祂用膏膏我, 叫我傳福音給貧窮的人; 差遣我報告:被擄的得釋放, 瞎眼的得看見, 叫那受壓制的得自由, 報告主的悅納人的禧年。"於是把書卷起來說:"今天這經已應驗在你們耳中了"(<a href="3927/luke_4_16.htm">路加福音4:16-21</a>)。現在要應驗經上的話, 說:"同我吃飯的人, 用腳踢我"(<a href="3927/john_13_18.htm">約翰福音13:18</a>)。其中除了那滅亡之子, 沒有一個滅亡的, 好叫經上的話得應驗(<a href="3927/john_17_12.htm">約翰福音17:12</a>)。這要應驗經上說的:"你所賜給我的人, 我沒有失落一個"(<a href="3927/john_18_9.htm">約翰福音18:9</a>)。耶穌對彼得說:"收刀入鞘吧！若是這樣, 經上所說, 事情必須如此的話, 怎麼應驗呢？但這一切的事成就了, 為要應驗先知書上的話"(<a href="3927/matthew_26_52.htm">馬太福音26:52</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>)。人子必要去世, 正如經上指著祂所寫的(<a href="3927/mark_14_21.htm">馬可福音14:21</a>, <a href="3927/mark_14_49.htm">49</a>)。這就應了經上的話說:"祂被列在罪犯之中"(<a href="3927/mark_15_28.htm">馬可福音15:28</a>;<a href="3927/luke_22_37.htm">路加福音22:37</a>)。這要應驗經上的話說:"他們分了我的外衣, 為我的裡衣拈鬮。"兵丁果然作了這事(<a href="3927/john_19_24.htm">約翰福音19:24</a>)。這事以後, 耶穌知道各樣的事已經成了, 為要使經上的話應驗, 就說:"我渴了"(<a href="3927/john_19_28.htm">約翰福音19:28</a>)。當耶穌受了那醋, 就說:"成了, "也就是應驗了(<a href="3927/john_19_30.htm">約翰福音19:30</a>)。這些事成了, 為要應驗經上的話說:"他的骨頭, 一根也不可折斷。"經上又有一句說:"他們要仰望自己所紮的人"(<a href="3927/john_19_36.htm">約翰福音19:36-37</a>)。
<p>在主離開之前, 祂教導祂的門徒們, 整本聖言寫的都是關於祂, 祂降世應驗了這些。正如下列話所說:祂對他們說:"無知的人哪！先知所說的一切話, 你們的心信得太遲鈍了。基督這樣受害, 又進入祂的榮耀, 豈不是應當的嗎？"於是從摩西和一切先知起, 凡經上所指著自己的話, 都給他們講解明白了(<a href="3927/luke_24_25.htm">路加福音24:25-27</a>)。
<p>耶穌還進一步說:摩西的律法, 先知的書和詩篇上所記的, 凡指著我的話, 都必須應驗(<a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">路加福音24:44-45</a>)。
<p>從下面主所說的話可以明顯看出, 祂在世上應驗了聖言的一切事情, 甚至小到至細節之事:我實在告訴你們, 就是天地都廢去了, 律法的一點一畫也不能廢去, 都要成全(<a href="3927/matthew_5_18.htm">馬太福音5:18</a>)。
<p>從以上所列舉內容, 你現在應當曉得, 主要成全(或應驗)律法的一切並不是指祂要成全十誡中的一切, 而是要成全聖言中的一切。從下列經文, 你可看到"律法"表示聖言中的一切事情:"耶穌說:'你們的律法上豈不是寫著:"我曾說你們是神"嗎？"(<a href="3927/john_10_34.htm">約翰福音10:34</a>,引用了<a href="3927/psalms_82_6.htm">詩篇82:6</a>)。"眾人回答說:'我們聽見律法上有話說, 基督是永存的。'"(<a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">約翰福音12:34</a>, John 12: 引用了<a href="3927/psalms_89_34.htm">詩篇89:34-37</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">110:4</a>; Psalms 110: 以及<a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">但以理書7:14</a>)。"這要應驗他們律法上所寫的話, 說:'他們無故地恨我'"(<a href="3927/john_15_25.htm">約翰福音15:25</a>, John 15: 引用了<a href="3927/psalms_35_19.htm">詩篇35:19</a>)。"天地廢去較比律法的一點一畫落空還容易"(<a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">路加福音16:17</a>)。這句中的"律法"指的是全部神聖的經書, 其它好幾處有類似的表達。 </p>

262. The fact that the Lord fulfilled everything in the Word is clear from passages where it says that he fulfilled the law and the Scripture, and completed all things. For example,
<p>Jesus said, "Do not think that I came to dissolve the Law and the Prophets. I did not come to dissolve them but to fulfill them. " (<a href="3927/matthew_5_17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>)
<p>Jesus went into the synagogue and stood up to read. He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, "The spirit of Jehovah is upon me; this is why he anointed me. He sent me to preach the good news to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release for the bound and sight for the blind, to preach the welcomed year of the Lord. " Afterward he rolled up the scroll and said, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. " (<a href="3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>)
<p>To fulfill the Scripture that said, "The one who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me. " (<a href="3927/john_13_18.htm">John 13:18</a>)
<p>Not one of them was lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. (<a href="3927/john_17_12.htm">John 17:12</a>)
<p>To fulfill the Word that said, "Of those whom you gave me, I did not lose one. " (<a href="3927/john_18_19.htm">John 18:19</a>)
<p>Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword away in its place. How then would the Scripture that this must occur be fulfilled? This has happened in order to fulfill the Scripture. " (<a href="3927/matthew_26_52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>)
<p>The Son of Humankind is leaving as it was written of him, so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled. (<a href="3927/mark_14_21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>, <a href="3927/mark_14_49.htm">49</a>)
<p>In this way the Scripture was fulfilled that said, "He was reckoned among the unholy. " (<a href="3927/mark_15_28.htm">Mark 15:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>)
<p>They divided his clothes among themselves, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: "On my inner garment they cast lots. " (<a href="3927/john_19_24.htm">John 19:24</a>)
<p>After this, Jesus knew that all things were now completed so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. (<a href="3927/john_19_28.htm">John 19:28</a>)
<p>When Jesus had received the vinegar he said, "It is complete," that is, fulfilled. (<a href="3927/john_19_30.htm">John 19:30</a>)
<p>These things happened to fulfill the Scripture that "You will not break a bone in him;" and furthermore another line in Scripture says, "They will see the One whom they pierced. " (<a href="3927/john_19_36.htm">John 19:36-37</a>)
<p>Before the Lord left, he taught his disciples that the whole Word was written about him and that he had come into the world to fulfill it, as the following words indicate:
<p>He said to them, "You are foolish and slow at heart to believe all the things that were spoken by the prophets. Was it not fitting for Christ to suffer and enter into glory?" Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted [points] regarding himself in all the Scriptures. (<a href="3927/luke_24_25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>)
<p>Further, Jesus said,
<p>It was right for all the things written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms to be fulfilled. (<a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44-45</a>)
<p>The following words of the Lord make it clear that in the world he fulfilled everything in the Word down to the least detail:
<p>Truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one little letter or the tip of one letter will pass from the law until all of it is fulfilled. (<a href="3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>)
<p>From the statements just made you can now clearly see that the Lord's fulfilling everything in the law does not mean that he fulfilled everything in the Ten Commandments; it means that he fulfilled everything in the whole Word. You can see that "the law" means everything in the Word from the following passages: "Jesus said, 'Is it not written in your law, "I said, 'You are gods'"?'" (<a href="3927/john_10_34.htm">John 10:34</a>; the passage quoted is written in <a href="3927/psalms_82_6.htm">Psalms 82:6</a>). "The crowd replied, 'We have heard from the law, Christ remains forever'" (<a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">John 12:34</a>; the passage quoted is written in <a href="3927/psalms_89_34.htm">Psalms 89:34-37</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">110:4</a>; and <a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>). "To fulfill the Word that is written in their law, 'They hated me for no reason'" (<a href="3927/john_15_25.htm">John 15:25</a>; the passage quoted is written in <a href="3927/psalms_35_19.htm">Psalms 35:19</a>). "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the tip of one letter of the law to fall" (<a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). The "law" in these passages means the whole of Sacred Scripture, as it does a number of times elsewhere. </p>

<p>
262. It is plain that the Lord fulfilled everything in the Word from a consideration of the passages where it is said that the Law and the Scripture were fulfilled by Him, and that everything was brought to completion, as in these where Jesus said:<p>Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law and the Prophets. I have come not to abolish, but to fulfil, <a href="3927/matthew_5_17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>.<p>Jesus entered the synagogue, and got up to read. Then there was handed to Him the book of the prophet Isaiah; and He unrolled the book and found the passage where it is written: The spirit of Jehovah is upon me, because He has anointed me; He has sent me to bring good news to the poor, to heal the broken in heart, to bring good news of release to those who are in bonds, and sight to the blind, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Afterwards He rolled up the book and said, To-day this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing, <a href="3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>. That the Scripture should be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel upon me, <a href="3927/john_13_18.htm">John 13:18</a>.<p>None of them has perished, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, <a href="3927/john_17_12.htm">John 17:12</a>.<p>That the word should be fulfilled which said, Of those you gave me, I have not lost one, <a href="3927/john_18_9.htm">John 18:9</a>. Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword away in its place. How then could the Scripture be fulfilled, which says that it must be thus. This was done so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <a href="3927/matthew_26_52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>.<p>The Son of Man goes away, as it is written of Him, so that the Scriptures should be fulfilled, <a href="3927/mark_14_21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>, <a href="3927/mark_14_49.htm">49</a>.<p>Thus the Scripture was fulfilled which said, He was counted with the irreligious, <a href="3927/mark_15_28.htm">Mark 15:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>.<p>That the Scripture might be fulfilled, they divided my <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
garments among them, and cast lots for my tunic, <a href="3927/john_19_24.htm">John 19:24</a>.<p>After this Jesus knowing that all things were now completed, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, <a href="3927/john_19_28.htm">John 19:28</a>.<p>When Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, it is completed (that is, fulfilled). <a href="3927/john_19_30.htm">John 19:30</a>.<p>These things were done so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone you shall not break in him; and again another Scripture says, They shall see him whom they pierced, <a href="3927/john_19_36.htm">John 19:36-37</a>.<p>He also taught His disciples, before He went away, that the whole Word was written about Him, and that He had come into the world to fulfil it, in these words:<p>He said to them, Foolish people and slow at heart to believe all that the Prophets have said! Surely this is what Christ ought to suffer, and enter into glory? Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them the references to Himself in all the Scriptures, <a href="3927/luke_24_25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>.<p>Further, Jesus said that all things ought to be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms about me (<a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44-45</a>).<p>It is plain from the Lord's words that, while He was in the world, He fulfilled everything in the Word down to the last details:<p>Amen I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all things are done, <a href="3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>.<p>This will now make it possible to see clearly that by the Lord fulfilling everything in the Law is not meant fulfilling all the Ten Commandments, but everything in the Word. These further passages will establish that the Law means everything in the Word:<p>Jesus said, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods, <a href="3927/john_10_34.htm">John 10:34</a>.<p>This is written in <a href="3927/psalms_82_6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>.<p>The crowd replied, We have heard from the law that the Christ shall remain for ever, <a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">John 12:34</a>.<p>This is written in <a href="3927/psalms_89_30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_89_37.htm">37</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>.<p>That the word should be fulfilled which is written in their Law, They hated me without cause, <a href="3927/john_15_25.htm">John 15:25</a>.<p>This is written in <a href="3927/psalms_35_19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>.<p>It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the Law to be lost, <a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>.<p>The Law here, as in many other passages, means the whole of Sacred Scripture.<p>

262. That the Lord fulfilled all things of the Word is evident from the passages where the Law and the Scripture are said to have been fulfilled by Him, and all things finished, as in the following. Jesus said: <p>Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill (<a href="3927/matthew_5_17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>). <p>Jesus entered into the synagogue, and stood up to read then was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And He opened the book, and found the place where it was written: The Spirit of Jehovah is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me; He hath sent Me to preach good tidings to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. And He closed the book and He said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears (<a href="3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>). <p>That the Scripture might be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted up his heel upon Me (<a href="3927/john_13_18.htm">John 13:18</a>). <p>None of them perished but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled (<a href="3927/john_17_12.htm">John 17:12</a>). <p>That the Word might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of them which thou gavest Me I lost not one (<a href="3927/john_18_9.htm">John 18:9</a>). <p>Jesus said to Peter: Put up thy sword into its place. How then shall the Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it must be? But all this is come to pass that the Scripture might be fulfilled (<a href="3927/matthew_26_52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>). <p>The Son of Man goeth as it is written of Him, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled (<a href="3927/mark_14_21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>, <a href="3927/mark_14_49.htm">49</a>). <p>Thus was the Scripture fulfilled, which said, He was numbered with the transgressors (<a href="3927/mark_15_28.htm">Mark 15:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>). <p>That the Scripture might be fulfilled, They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture did they cast lots (<a href="3927/john_19_24.htm">John 19:24</a>). <p>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled (<a href="3927/john_19_28.htm">John 19:28</a>). <p>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished [that is, fulfilled]. (<a href="3927/john_19_30.htm">John 19:30</a>). <p>These things came to pass that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone in Him shall ye not brake. And again another Scripture saith, They shall look on Him whom they pierced (<a href="3927/john_19_36.htm">John 19:36, 37</a>). <p>That the whole Word was written concerning Him, and that He came into the world to fulfill it, He also taught His disciples before He went away, in these words: <p>He said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken. Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into His glory? And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself (<a href="3927/luke_24_25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>). <p>Again Jesus said, that all things must needs be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms concerning Me (<a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44, 45</a>). <p>That the Lord when in the world fulfilled all things of the Word, even to the most minute particulars, is plain from His words: <p>Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished (<a href="3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). <p>From all this it can now be clearly seen that the Lord's fulfilling all things of the law does not mean that He fulfilled all the commandments of the Decalogue, but all things of the Word. That all things of the Word are meant by the Law can be seen from these passages: <p>Jesus said, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? (<a href="3927/john_10_34.htm">John 10:34</a>). <p>This is written in the<a href="3927/psalms_82_6.htm">Psalms 82:6</a>. <p>The multitudes answered, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth forever (<a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">John 12:34</a>). <p>This is written in the<a href="3927/psalms_89_30.htm">Psalms 89:30</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_89_37.htm">37</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">110:4</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>. <p>That the Word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated Me without a cause (<a href="3927/john_15_25.htm">John 15:26</a>). <p>This is written in <a href="3927/psalms_35_19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>. <p>It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fall (<a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). <p>By the law in this passage, as frequently elsewhere, the whole Sacred Scripture is meant. </p>

262. The Lord fulfilled all things in the Word, as is evident from the passages where it is said that the Law and the Scripture were fulfilled by Him, and that all things were accomplished; as in the following passages. Jesus said:<p>"Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil" <a href="3927/matthew_5_17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<p>Jesus "went into the synagogue... and stood up for to read.

To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;Jotha una, aut unum corniculum. Tittle is a form of tit, meaning something small, or, according to Skeat, a jot. In this passage (A. V.) Tittle is used to translate corniculum, literally a little horn; and in <a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a> to translate apex. Apex means an extreme point; the small spike wound round with wool at the top of a priest's cap; also a letter, or a part of a letter. Both words are represented in the Greek in those two passages by keraia, a horn. This is also translated a kern, or flourish at the end of a letter; thus a small part of a letter; or according to Liddell and Scott, a tittle. See also 278, 483, 581. </p>

262. Quod Dominus impleverit omnia Verbi, patet ex locis, ubi dicitur, quod ab Ipso impleta sit Lex et Scriptura, et quod omnia consummata sint, ut ex his, dixit Jesus, nolite putare, quod venerim ad solvendum LEGEM et PROPHETAS, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
non veni ad solvendum, SED AD IMPLENDUM, <a href="3927/matthew_5_17.htm">Matthaeus 5:17-18</a>. Jesus intravit in Synagogam, et surrexit ad legendum, tunc traditus est Ipsi Liber Esajae Prophetae, et evolvit Librum, et invenit Locum scriptum: Spiritus Jehovae super me, propter quod unxit me, ad evangelizandum pauperibus misit me, ad sanandum contritos corde, ad evangelizandum vinctis remissionem, et caecis visum, ad praedicandum Annum Domini acceptum: Postea convolvens Librum, dixit, HODIE IMPLETA EST SCRIPTURA HAEC IN AURIBUS VESTRIS, <a href="3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luca 4:16-21</a>. Ut SCRIPTURA IMPLERETUR, qui comedit Mecum <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>

Nemo ex illis periit, nisi filius perditionis, ut SCRIPTURA IMPLERETUR, <a href="3927/john_17_12.htm">Johannes 17:12</a>. Ut IMPLERETUR VERBUM, quod dixit, quos dedisti Mihi, non perdidi ex illis unum, <a href="3927/john_18_9.htm">Johannes 18:9</a>. <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
Jesus dixit Petro, absconde tuum gladium in loco suo, QUOMODO ERGO IMPLERETUR SCRIPTURA, quod sic oporteat fieri: hoc autem factum est ut IMPLERETUR SCRIPTURA, <a href="3927/matthew_26_52.htm">Matthaeus 26:52</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
Filius hominis abit sicut SCRIPTUM EST de Ipso, ut IMPLERENTUR SCRIPTURAE, <a href="3927/mark_14_21.htm">Marcus 14:21</a>, <a href="3927/mark_14_49.htm">49</a>. <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>

IMPLETA EST SCRIPTURA, quae dixit, cum impiis reputatus est, <a href="3927/mark_15_28.htm">Marcus 15:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_37.htm">Luca 22:37</a>. Ut SCRIPTURA IMPLERETUR, diviserunt vestimenta mea <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>

Post hoc sciens Jesus, quod omnia jam Consummata essent, ut IMPLERETUR SCRIPTURA, <a href="3927/john_19_28.htm">Johannes 19:28</a>. Cum Jesus accepisset acetum, dixit CONSUMMATUM est, hoc est, IMPLETUM, <a href="3927/john_19_30.htm">Johannes 19:30</a>.

Quod omne Verbum de Ipso scriptum sit, et quod in Mundum venerit ut illud impleret, docuit etiam Discipulis antequam abivit, his verbis, Dixit ad illos, stulti et tardi corde ad credendum omnibus, quae loquuti sunt Prophetae, nonne hoc oportebat pati Christum, et ingredi in gloriam: incipiens porro a MOSE ET AB OMNIBUS PROPHETIS, et interpretatus est illis <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
IN OMNIBUS SCRIPTURIS DE IPSO, <a href="3927/luke_24_25.htm">Luca 24:25-26</a>. Porro, Jesus dixit, QUOD OPORTERET IMPLERI OMNIA, QUAE SCRIPTA SUNT IN LEGE MOSIS, ET PROPHETIS, ET PSALMIS DE ME, <a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luca 24:44</a>. <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
Quod Dominus in Mundo impleverit omnia Verbi, usque ad singularissima ejus, patet ab his Ipsius verbis, Amen dico vobis, usque dum praetereat Coelum et Terra, JOTHA UNA, AUT UNUM CORNICULUM NON PRAETERIBIT DE LEGE, DONEC OMNIA FIANT, <a href="3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthaeus 5:18</a>. Ex his nunc clare videri potest, quod per id quod Dominus impleverit omnia Legis, non intelligatur, quod impleverit omnia praecepta Decalogi, sed quod omnia Verbi. Quod omnia Verbi per Legem etiam intelligantur, constare potest ex his, Jesus dixit, nonne scriptum est in LEGE VESTRA, Ego dixi, dii estis, <a href="3927/john_10_34.htm">Johannes 10:34</a>, hoc scriptum est, <a href="3927/psalms_82_6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>. <sup "fn120_10">10</sup>
