<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第196节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>196</b>.（2）属灵之义存在于圣言的每一部分和每个细节中。这一点从下面的例子可以看出来。约翰在启示录中说：<br />我观看，见天开了。有一匹白马，骑在马上的称为诚信真实，祂审判、争战都按着公义。祂的眼睛如火焰，祂头上戴着许多冠冕；又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道。祂穿着溅了血的衣服；祂的名称为神之道。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着说：万王之王，万主之主。我又看见一位天使站在日头中，向天空所飞的鸟大声喊着说，你们聚集来赴神的大筵席，可以吃君王与将军的肉，壮士与马和骑马者的肉，并一切自主的、为奴的，以及大小人民的肉。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">启示录19:11</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">18</a>）。<br />若不通过圣言的属灵之义，没有人能明白这些话的意思。若不了解对应关系，没有人能明白属灵之义。因为每句话都对应某种事物，没有一句是没有意义的。对应学说明了“白马”、“骑在马上的”、“眼睛如火焰”、“头上的冠冕”、“溅了血的衣服”、天上众军所穿的“白麻衣”、“天使站在日头中”、天上的飞鸟聚集来吃“大筵席”，以及它们要吃“君王与将军的肉”和更多其它肉的含义。<br />所有这些细节的属灵之义在我的《破解启示录》（820－838节）一书，以及小册子《白马》有详细阐述，故进一步阐述它们是多余的。那里说明，这段经文描述的是作为圣言的主。其如火焰的眼睛表示其神性之爱的神圣智慧。祂头上的冠冕和除祂之外无人知道的名字表示出于其圣言的神圣真理。除了主和祂所揭示给的那些人外，没有人能明白圣言在其属灵之义方面的性质。溅了血的衣服表示圣言的属世之义，就是字义，它已被施暴。很明显，这段经文描述的是圣言，因为经上说：“祂的名称为神之道”。同样很明显，所指的是主，因为经上说：“坐在白马上的那位名为万王之王、万主之主。”这里的“万王之王、万主之主”与启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.14.htm">17:14</a>）中的一个意思，那里经上说：“羔羊必胜过他们，因为祂是万主之主、万王之王。”<br />圣言的属灵之义要在教会末期被揭示出来，这一点既是有关“白马”和“坐在马上的那位”的论述所表示的，也是站在日头中的天使邀请天空所飞的鸟来赴的大筵席，在席上可以吃君王与将军等等的肉所表示的；以此表示吸收主的一切良善。所有这些表述若没有属灵之义，就等于身体没有灵魂，只是一些空洞的话语，既没有生命，也没有灵性。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #196 </h4>
<p>
196. (2)全部聖言,甚至每個細節都有屬靈意義。
<p>最好的方法就是從下列例子中來理解。
<p>在『啟示錄』中, 約翰說:我觀看, 見天開了。有一匹白馬, 騎在馬上的稱為誠信真實, 祂審判,爭戰, 都按著公義。祂的眼睛如火焰, 祂頭上戴著許多冠冕; 又有寫著的名字, 除了祂自己沒有人知道。祂穿著濺了血的衣服; 祂的名稱為上帝之道。在天上的眾軍騎著白馬, 穿著細麻衣, 又白又潔。在祂衣服和大腿上有名寫著說:"萬王之王, 萬主之主。"我又看見一位天人站在日頭中, 大聲喊著說:"你們聚焦來赴上帝的大筵席, 可以吃君王和將軍的肉, 壯士與馬和騎馬者的肉, 關一切自主的為奴的, 以及大小人民的肉"(<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">啟示錄19:11-18</a>)。
<p>除非從聖言的屬靈意義, 無人能明白這些話的意思。除非藉著學習對應的知識, 無人能明白屬靈的意義。所有這些話都是對應, 沒有一個詞無意義。對應的知識顯明了下列話語的意義:"白馬", "騎在馬上的", "眼睛如火焰", "頭上的冠冕", "濺了血的衣服", 祂的眾軍所穿的"又白又潔的細麻衣", "天人站在日頭中", 聚焦來赴的"大筵席", 還有要吃"君王和將軍的肉"等等。
<p>[2]每個細節都有屬靈的意義, 詳見<a href="../ar/820.htm">破解啟示錄820-838</a>節, 還有『白馬』一書。因為那裡有詳細的解說, 在此就不再逐一細說。這些經文描述了作為聖言(或者道)的主:祂的眼睛如火焰表示由祂聖仁而來的聖智; 頭上的冠冕和除祂之外無人知道的名字表示由祂而來的聖言的神性真理, 除了祂自己以及祂揭示的人, 無人明白聖言的屬靈意義; 濺血的衣服表示聖言的屬世意義, 就是字面意義, 已遭受破壞。
<p>很明顯, 道(或聖言)在此被描述, 因為這樣說:"祂的名稱為上帝之道"。也很明顯, 在此所指的是主, 因為這樣說:"坐在白馬上的那位名為萬王之王,萬主之主。"就像<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">啟示錄17:14</a>所言:"羔羊必勝過它, 因為祂是萬主之主,萬王之王。"
<p>[3]聖言的屬靈意義在教會走向終結時被揭示出來, 白馬和坐在馬上的那位表示這個意思。另外, 大筵席,以及日頭中的天人發邀請來吃君王和將軍之肉等, 也表示這個意思, 表示人當吸收各樣由主所賜的良善。
<p>如果內中沒有屬靈意義,如同靈魂在身體之中, 那麼這些話就是些毫無意義的話語, 沒有生命,沒有靈。 </p>

<p>
196. 2. There is a spiritual meaning throughout the Word and in every part of it. The best way to see this is through examples as follows:
<p>In the Book of Revelation John says,
<p>I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. The One sitting on it was called faithful and true, who judges with justice and does battle. His eyes were like a flame of fire. On his head were many gems. He had a name written that no one knew except him. He was dressed in blood-stained clothing. His name was the Word of God. His armies in heaven followed him on white horses; they were dressed in linen that was white and clean. On his clothing and on his thigh he had a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lord's. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun who was crying with a great voice, "Come and gather yourselves for the great feast, that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and those who ride on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slaves, small and great. " (<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>)
<p>No one can see what these words mean except from the Word's spiritual meaning. We cannot see the spiritual meaning unless we work with the study of correspondences. All these words are correspondences; not a word is pointless. The study of correspondences teaches the meaning of the white horse, the One sitting on it, the eyes like a flame of fire, the gems on his head, the blood-stained clothing, the white linen worn by the members of his army from heaven, the angel standing in the sun, the great feast to which people should come and gather themselves, and the flesh of kings and commanders and of many other people and things that they were supposed to eat.
</p>

<p>
[2] For what each detail means spiritually, see the explanations in <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_820.htm">Revelation Unveiled 820-838</a>. See also the small work White Horse. Because of those treatments, I will forgo a detailed explanation here. There I have shown that this passage describes the Lord in his role as the Word. His eyes that were like a flame of fire mean the divine wisdom that comes from his divine love. The gems on his head and the name that no one knows except him mean the divine truths of the Word that come from him and the fact that no one sees the nature of the Word in its spiritual meaning except the Lord and anyone to whom he reveals it. The blood-stained clothing means the Word's earthly meaning, its literal meaning, that has had violence inflicted upon it.
<p>It is obvious that the Word is being described, because it says, "His name is the Word of God. " It is also obvious that the passage refers to the Lord, because it says that the name of the One sitting on the white horse was King of Kings and Lord of Lord's. This is like <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, where it says, "The Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of Lord's and King of Kings. "
</p>
<p>
[3] The necessity for the Word's spiritual aspect to be revealed when the church comes to an end - this is the inner meaning of what is said of the white horse and the One sitting on it. It is also the meaning of an angel standing in the sun, extending an invitation to all to come and eat the flesh of kings and commanders and so on. Eating these things means our incorporation into ourselves of everything that is good from the Lord.
<p>All the expressions in this passage would be pointless words, words without life or spirit, if there were no spiritual meaning inside them like the soul in a body. </p>

</h4>
<p>
196. (ii) THE SPIRITUAL SENSE IS PRESENT IN EVERY PART AND DETAIL OF THE WORD.<p>This can be seen by examples, such as the following. John says in Revelation:<p>I saw heaven open, and there was a white horse; and he who sat on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and fights. And his eyes were a flame of fire; and on his head were many diadems. He had a name written, which no one but he knows. And he was clothed in a garment dyed in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. His armies in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, clean linen. He has written on his garment and on his thigh his name: King of kings and Lord of lords. I saw further an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice, Come and gather for the great feast, to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all free men and slaves, both small and great, <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>.<p>No one can see what all this means except from the spiritual sense of the Word; and no one can see this except by knowing the correspondences. For every word corresponds to something and not one is without meaning. A knowledge of correspondences shows the meaning of 'a white horse', 'him who sat on it', 'eyes like a flame of fire', the 'diadems' on his head, 'the garment dyed in blood', 'the white linen' worn by His army in heaven, 'the angel standing in the sun', 'the great feast' to which they were to come and gather, as well as 'the flesh of kings and captains' and many more, which they were to eat.</p>
<p>

[2] The meaning in the spiritual sense of all these details has been expounded in My Apocalypse Revealed (<a href="820.htm">820-838</a>), and my short work THE WHITE HORSE, so it would be superfluous to expound them further. It was shown there that this is a description of the Lord as the Word. His eyes like a flame of fire mean the Divine wisdom of His Divine love. The diadems on His head and the name which no one but He knows mean the Divine truths in the Word which come from Him, and that no one sees what the Word is like in its spiritual sense except the Lord and those to whom He reveals it. A garment dyed in blood means the natural sense of the Word, that is, the literal sense, to which violence was done. It is quite plain that it is the Word which is so described, for it says 'His name is called The Word of God.' It is also quite plain that it is the Lord who is meant, for it says that the name of him who sat on the white horse was 'King of kings and Lord of lords', much as in <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, where it says: 'And the Lamb shall overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings'.</p>
<p>
[3] The spiritual sense of the Word being laid bare at the end of the church is what is meant not only by what is said about the white horse and him who sat on it, but also by the great feast, to which the angel standing in the sun invited all to come, and to eat the flesh of kings and captains, etc.; this means making one's own all the kinds of good given by the Lord. All the expressions used there would be meaningless, devoid of life and spirit, if they did not inwardly contain a spiritual sense, just as the body contains a soul. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #196 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
196. (2) The spiritual sense is in each and every part of the Word. This can be best seen by example, as in the following. In the Apocalypse John says: <p>I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness He doth judge and make war. And His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, having a name written that no man but Himself knoweth. And He was clothed in a garment dyed in blood and His name is called The Word of God. His armies in heaven were following Him upon white horses, and were clothed in fine linen, white and clean. He hath on His garment and on His thigh a name written King of kings and Lord of lords. I saw also an angel standing in the sun, who cried with a loud voice, Come and be gathered together unto the great supper; that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders of thousands and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those that sit on them, and the flesh of all, free and bond, small and great (<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">19:11-18</a>). <p>What these words signify no one can see except from the spiritual sense of the Word; and no one can see the spiritual sense except from a knowledge of correspondences for all these words are correspondences, and not one of them is void of meaning. The science of correspondences teaches the significance of "the white horse," of "Him who sat upon him," of "His eyes" which were "like a flame of fire," of "the diadems on His head," "the garment dyed in blood," "the white linen" with which those were clothed who belonged to His army in heaven, of "the angel standing in the sun," of "the great supper" to which the fowls of heaven "came and were gathered together" and of "the flesh of kings and commanders of thousands" and many others whose flesh they were to eat.
</p>
<p>
[2] But what each particular thing signifies in the spiritual sense can be seen explained in the Apocalypse Revealed (n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_820.htm">820-838</a>) and also in the little work on The White Horse; therefore further explanation of them is unnecessary. It is there shown that it is the Lord as to the Word who is described; and that by "His eyes which were like a flame of fire" the Divine wisdom of His Divine love is meant; and by "the diadems on His head" and "the name which no one but Himself knew" the Divine truths of the Word from Him are meant, and that the nature of the Word in its spiritual sense is seen by none but the Lord and him to whom He reveals it; also by "His garment dyed in blood" the natural sense of the Word is meant, which is the sense of the letter, to which violence has been done. It is very clear that it is the Word that is thus described, for it is said, "His name is called the Word of God." That it is the Lord who is meant is equally clear, for it is said that the name of the One sitting upon the white horse was, "King of kings and Lord of lords," the same as in <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, where it is said, "And the Lamb shall overcome them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings."
</p>
<p>
[3] That the spiritual sense of the Word is to be opened at the end of the church is signified not only by what is said of the white horse and Him who sat upon it, but also by the great supper to which the angel standing in the sun invited all [the fowls of heaven] to come, and to eat the flesh of kings, of commanders of thousands, and so forth; by which is signified the appropriation of all goods from the Lord. All these expressions would be empty words, and without life and spirit, if there were no spiritual sense with in them like the soul in the body. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #196 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
196. (2) THE SPIRITUAL SENSE IS IN THE WHOLE OF THE WORD, AND IN EVERY PART OF IT.<p>This cannot be better seen than from examples, such as the following: John says in the Revelation:<p>"I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness He doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns; and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself: And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean... And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying, Come and gather yourselves together unto the great supper (A.V., the supper of the great God); That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all, free and bond, both small and great" <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>.<p>What these words signify no one can see but from the spiritual sense of the Word; and no one can see the spiritual sense of the Word but from a knowledge of correspondences, for all the words are correspondences and not one is without meaning. The science of correspondences teaches the signification of a white horse, of Him that sat upon it, of His eyes which were like a flame of fire, of the crowns which were on His head, of the vesture dipped in blood, of the white linen with which they who were of His army in heaven were clothed, of the angel standing in the sun, of the great supper to which they should come and gather themselves, and also of the flesh of kings, captains and many others which they were to eat.</p>
<p>
[2] The particular signification of each of those things in the spiritual sense may be seen explained in <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_820.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed 820-838</a>; and also in the small work on "The White Horse;" it is therefore unnecessary to explain them here at great length. In those books it is shown that in the passage just quoted the Lord is described as to the Word. By His eyes, which were as a flame of fire, is meant the Divine Wisdom of His Divine Love; by the crowns, which were on His head, and by the name which no one knew but Himself, are meant the Divine truths of the Word from Him, and that no one knows what the Word is in its spiritual sense, except the Lord and those to whom He reveals it; also, by His vesture dipped in blood is meant the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its Letter, to which violence had been done. It is very evident that it is the Word which is thus described, for it is said, "His name is called The Word of God." It is also clear that it is the Lord who is meant, for it is said that the name of Him who sat upon the white horse was "King of kings and Lord of lords," the same term being used in <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, where it is said: "And the Lamb shall overcome them: for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings." That the spiritual sense of the Word would be revealed at the end of the Church is signified not only by what is said of the white horse, and of Him that sat upon it, but also by the great supper to which all were invited to come by the angel standing in the sun, to eat the flesh of kings and captains and the rest, by which is meant the appropriation of good of all kinds from the Lord. All these expressions would be without meaning, and without life and spirit, unless there was within them a spiritual sense, as the soul is within the body. </p>

196. II. QUOD SENSUS SPIRITUALIS IN OMNIBUS ET SINGULIS VERBI SIT, non melius videri potest, quam ab Exemplis; quae sint haec sequentia. Dicit Johannes in Apocalypsi, Vidi Coelum apertum, cum ecce Equus Albus, et qui Sedens super eo vocabatur Fidelis et Verus, qui in Justitia judicat et pugnat: et Oculi ejus flamma ignis; ac super Capite Ejus diademata multa, habens Nomen scriptum, quod nemo scit nisi Ipse: et indutus erat vestimento tincto sanguine; et vocatur Nomen Ipsius VERBUM DEI. Exercitus Ejus <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
in Coelo sequebantur Ipsum super Equis albis, induti byssinum album et mundum. Habet super vestimento et super femore suo Nomen scriptum REX REGUM ET DOMINUS DOMINORUM. Vidi porro unum Angelum stantem in Sole, qui clamavit voce magna, venite et congregamini ad Coenam magnam, ut comedatis carnes regum, et carnes chiliarchorum, et carnes fortium, et carnes equorum et sedentium super illis, et carnes omnium liberorum et servorum, et parvorum et magnorum, Cap. <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Apocalypsis 19:11-18</a>. Quid haec significant, nemo videre potest nisi ex Sensu spirituali Verbi, et nemo Sensum spiritualem nisi ex scientia Correspondentiarum; nam omnes voces sunt correspondentiae, et nulla vox est vana. Scientia Correspondentiarum docet, quid significat Equus albus, quid Sedens super illo, quid Oculi qui sicut flamma ignis, quid Diademata quae super capite, quid Vestimentum tinctum sanguine, quid Byssinum album, quo induti qui ab exercitu <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Ipsius in Coelo, quid Angelus stans in Sole, quid Coena magna ad quam venirent et congregarentur, tum quid Carnes regum et chiliarchorum, et plurium aliorum, quas comederent.</p>
<p>
[2] Quid autem singula illa in Sensu spirituali significant, in <a href="3927/swedenborg_apocalypsis-explicata_820.htm">APOCALYPSI REVELATA 820-832</a>, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
et quoque in Opusculo de EQUO ALBO, explicatum videatur, quare illa ulterius explicare supersedetur: ibi ostensum est, quod Dominus quoad Verbum ibi describatur, et quod per Oculos Ipsius qui sicut flamma ignis, intelligatur Divina Sapientia Divini Amoris Ipsius; et per Diademata quae super Capite, et quod per Nomen, quod nemo scit nisi Ipse, intelligantur Divina Vera Verbi ab Ipso, et quod quale est Verbum in sensu spirituali nemo videat quam Dominus, et cui Ipse revelat; tum, quod per Vestimentum tinctum sanguine, intelligatur sensus naturalis Verbi, qui est sensus literae ejus, cui violentia illata est; quod sit Verbum, quod ita describitur, manifeste patet, nam dicitur, VOCATUR NOMEN EJUS VERBUM DEI; quod sit Dominus qui intelligitur, etiam manifeste patet, nam dicitur quod Nomen Sedentis super Equo Albo esset, REX REGUM ET DOMINUS DOMINORUM, similiter ut in <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Apocalypsi 17:14</a>, ubi dicitur, Et Agnus vincet illos, quia EST DOMINUS DOMINORUM ET REX REGUM.</p>
<p>
[3] Quod Sensus spiritualis Verbi aperiendus sit in fine Ecclesiae, significatur non modo per illa quae de Equo Albo et de Sedente super illo dicta sunt, sed etiam per Coenam magnam, ad quam per Angelum in Sole stantem, omnes invitati sunt ut venirent, et ederent carnes regum, et chiliarchorum, etc, per quae significatur appropriatio omnium bonorum a Domino. Omnes ibi expressiones forent voces vanae, et absque vita et spiritu, nisi Sensus spiritualis intus in illis esset, sicut anima in corpore.<p>
