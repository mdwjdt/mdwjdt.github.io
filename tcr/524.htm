524. These points may be illustrated with comparisons. The sins that we retain when we do not practice repentance are like various diseases we suffer that are fatal unless we are given medicine that takes away what is causing harm. Such sins are especially like gangrene, which spreads (if not caught in time) and inevitably leads to death. They are like boils and abscesses that have not been lanced and opened - the accumulation of pus will press into surrounding tissues, then into nearby internal organs, and finally into the heart, causing death.
</p>
<p>
[2] Sins that remain can also be compared with tigers, leopards, lions, wolves, and foxes. Unless these animals are kept in caves or are bound with ropes or chains, they will attack our flocks and herds, like a fox among the hens, and slaughter them. Such sins are like poisonous snakes - if the snakes are not held down with pegs and their fangs removed, they will inflict their deadly bite on us. If a whole flock of sheep is left in fields that have poisonous plants, they will die unless the shepherd moves them to safe pasture. A silkworm and therefore its silk will be destroyed if other grubs are not shaken from the leaves of its tree.
</p>
<p>
[3] Sins that remain can also be compared to grains kept in barns or houses, which become moldy, rancid, and therefore useless if they do not have enough air circulating around them to take away the harmful elements. If a fire is not extinguished when it first breaks out, it will destroy the whole city or the entire forest. If thistles and thornbushes are not uprooted, they will completely overrun a garden.
<p>As experienced gardeners know, a trunk that comes from bad seed or a bad root sends its noxious sap into the branch of a good tree that has been grafted onto it, and the bad sap that creeps up that branch is then turned into good sap and produces useful fruit. Something similar occurs in us when evil is laid aside through the process of repentance; through repentance we are grafted onto the Lord like a branch onto a vine and we bear good fruit (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>). </p>

524 .I shall use comparisons to illustrate this. The sins which are retained in an unrepentant person may be compared with the various illnesses he suffers, and unless cures are applied to get rid of the harmful element, he may die of them; in particular with the condition called gangrene, which, if not cured in time, spreads around and leads inevitably to a fatal outcome. Likewise they may be compared with boils and abscesses, unless they are resolved and opened up, for they lead to empyema or gatherings of pus which invade neighbouring parts, then attacking the adjacent viscera, and finally the heart, so causing death.</p>
<p>
[2] I may also compare them with tigers, leopards, lions, wolves and foxes, which, unless kept in cages or secured with chains or ropes, would attack flocks and herds and slaughter them, as a fox does hens. Or with poisonous snakes, which unless pinned down with forks or deprived of their teeth, would inflict fatal injuries on a person. A whole flock of sheep, if left in fields where noxious plants grow, would perish if the shepherd did not lead them away into harmless pastures. The silk-worm, and thus all silk, would perish if other grubs were not shaken out of the leaves of the tree it lives on.</p>
<p>
[3] Another comparison might be with grain in barns <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
or houses, which would turn mouldy and rotten and become unfit for use, if air were not allowed to circulate around and prevent this damage. A fire, if not put out at its outset, might devastate a whole town or a whole forest. A garden would become completely overgrown with caltrops, thistles and briars, if these were not uprooted. Expert gardeners know that if a tree springs from a poor seed or a poor root, it introduces its poor juices into the trunk of a good tree which is grafted or inoculated into it, and the poor juices which rise into it are turned into good juices and produce useful fruit. Much the same happens to a person when evil is removed by means of repentance, for by this a person is grafted onto the Lord like a branch onto a vine, and produces good fruit (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>).<p>

524. But these statements shall be illustrated by comparisons: The sins an impenitent man holds fast to may be compared to various diseases in him, from which, he dies unless remedies are applied and the malignities thereby removed. They may be compared especially to the disease called gangrene, which unless healed in time, spreads, and causes inevitable death; in like manner to boils and abscesses, unless they break out or are opened; for from them empyemata or collections of pus will be diffused into the neighboring parts, from these into adjoining viscera, and finally into the heart, from which comes death.
</p>
<p>
[2] These sins may also be compared to tigers, leopards, lions, wolves, and foxes, which unless kept in dens or bound with chains or ropes, would attack the flocks and herds and kill them as the fox does poultry; also to poisonous serpents, which unless held tight with sticks, or deprived of their teeth, would inflict deadly wounds upon man. A whole flock, if left in fields where there are poisonous herbs, instead of being led by the shepherd to safe pastures; would perish. So the silk-worm would perish, and all silk with it, unless other worms were kept from the leaves of its tree.
</p>
<p>
[3] These sins may also be compared to grain in granaries or barns, which would be rendered musty and rotten and thus useless, if the air were not permitted to pass freely through it, and remove whatever is injurious. If a fire were not quenched at the very outset, it might lay waste a whole city or forest. Thorns, briars, and thistles would take full possession of a garden unless rooted out. Gardeners know that a tree sprung from a bad seed and root conveys its bad sap to the branch of a good tree budded or engrafted upon it, and that the bad sap which comes up is turned into good sap, and produces useful fruit. And the like takes place in man through the removal of evil by means of repentance; for man is thereby engrafted into the Lord as a branch into a vine, and bears good fruit (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>). </p>

524. Some comparisons will serve to illustrate these things. When sins remain in an impenitent man they are like various diseases which prove fatal unless their danger is removed by the administration of proper medicines. They especially resemble gangrene which, unless it is cured in time, spreads and causes inevitable death. They also resemble purulent abscesses which, unless they are opened and cleared, will discharge pus into neighboring parts and thence into adjacent viscera, and finally into the heart, and so cause death.</p>
<p>
[2] Such unremoved sins may also be compared to tigers, leopards, lions, wolves and foxes which, unless they are confined in dens or bound with chains or ropes, would attack flocks and herds, as a fox does poultry, and kill them. They may also be compared to venomous serpents which, unless pressed down and held by forked stakes, or deprived of their teeth, would inflict deadly wounds on men. The whole flock would perish if it were left in fields where there are poisonous plants, unless the shepherd led it away to wholesome pastures. The silk-worm too would die, and with it all silk would disappear, unless destructive insects were shaken from the tree on which it feeds.</p>
<p>
[3] Corn kept in barns or store houses would become musty and rancid, and thus unfit for use, unless air were allowed to pass freely through it and remove all impurities. A fire that is not extinguished when it first breaks out will destroy a whole city or forest. A garden that is not kept clear of weeds will soon be entirely overgrown with brambles, thistles and thorns. Gardeners know that an inferior tree sends its own sap from its seed and root into the branch or bud of a good tree engrafted or inoculated upon it, and that the inferior sap which enters from beneath is transformed, and produces useful fruits. Something similar happens with a man when his evils are removed by means of repentance, for by this he is engrafted in the Lord as a branch in a vine, and bears good fruit, <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">8</a>. </p>

524. Sed haec illustrabuntur per Comparationes; cum peccatis retentis apud hominem impoenitentem, cum variis morbis apud illum, quibus nisi applicantur medicinae, et per has auferuntur maligna, homo moritur; imprimis cum morbo gangraena vocato qui nisi in tempore sanatur, circum spargit se, et lethum non evitabilem <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>

<p>
