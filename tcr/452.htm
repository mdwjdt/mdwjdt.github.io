<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第452节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>452</b>.然而，伪仁爱是这些人的特征：他们在教会或家里在神面前屈膝跪拜，几乎仆倒在地，虔诚地作长长的祷告，摆出一副圣洁的面孔，亲吻十字架的形像和死人的骨头，跪在坟墓旁边，在那里嘟哝着对神进行神圣敬拜的话，而心里却在思想着被敬拜的，是他们自己，希望自己如神明那样被崇拜。主的这些话所描述的，就是这些人：<br />你施舍的时候，不可在你前面吹号，象那假冒为善的人在会堂里和街道上所行的，故意要得人的荣耀。你们祷告的时候，不可像那假冒为善的人，爱站在会堂里和十字路口上祷告，故意叫人看见。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.2.htm">马太福音6:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.5.htm">5</a>）<br />你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们正当人前，把天堂的门关了，自己不进去，正要进去的人，你们也不容他们进去。你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们走遍洋海陆地，勾引一个人入教；既入了教，却使他作地狱之子，比你们还加倍。你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.13.htm">马太福音23:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.25.htm">25</a>）<br />以赛亚指着你们假冒为善之人所说的预言是不错的。如经上说：“这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.6.htm">马可福音7:6</a>）<br />你们有祸了！因为你们如同不显露的坟墓，走在上面的人并不知道。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.44.htm">路加福音11:44</a>）<br />还有其它一些经文。这些人就像无血之肉，或像被调教重复诗篇里的话的乌鸦和鹦鹉；又像被训练唱宗教圣歌小曲的鸟儿。他们的说话声如同捕禽者引诱（禽鸟）的声音。</p>

<p>
452. 然而虛偽之義, 是指一些人在教會或家中跪拜上帝, 幾乎頭磕到地板, 發出很長的禱告, 板著嚴肅的臉, 親吻十字架與死人的骨頭, 在墳前屈膝, 嘟噥著敬拜上帝的神聖詞語, 但是在內心反復思量著自己如何被尊敬, 希望自己被敬如神明。
<p>他們就像主在下面經文中描述之人:你施捨的時候, 不可在你前面吹號, 象那假冒為善的人在會堂裡和街道上所行的, 故意要得人的榮耀。你們禱告的時候, 不可像那假冒為善的人, 愛站在會堂裡和十字路口上禱告, 故意叫人看見(<a href="3927/matthew_6_2.htm">馬太福音6:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>)。
<p>你們這假冒為善的文士和法利賽人有禍了！因為你們正當人前, 把天國的門關了; 自己不進去, 正要進去的人, 你們也不容他們進去。你們這假冒為善的文士和法利賽人有禍了！因為你們走遍洋海陸地, 勾引一個人入教; 既入了教, 卻使他作地獄之子, 比你們還加倍。你們這假冒為善的文士和法利賽人有禍了！因為你們洗淨杯盤的外面, 裡面卻盛滿了勒索和放蕩(<a href="3927/matthew_23_13.htm">馬太福音23:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">25</a>)。
<p>以賽亞指著你們假冒為善之人所說的預言, 是不錯的。如經上說:"這百姓用嘴唇尊敬我, 心卻遠離我"(<a href="3927/mark_7_6.htm">馬可福音7:6</a>)。你們有禍了！因為你們如同不顯露的墳墓, 走在上面的人並不知道(<a href="3927/luke_11_44.htm">路加福音11:44</a>)。還有其他一些經文。
<p>這些人就像無血之肉; 或像烏鴉和鸚鵡被教會來重複『詩篇』的話語; 或者像訓練有素的鳥兒, 能用讚美詩的音調來歌唱。他們說話的聲音就如同捕禽者的誘餌。 </p>

452. Hypocritical goodwill is what people have who in church or at home bow themselves down until their heads almost touch the floor before God, devoutly pour forth long prayers, wear holy expressions, kiss images of the cross and bones of the dead, genuflect at graves, and mumble words of sacred veneration of God with their lips, but all the while they desire at heart to be worshiped themselves and intend to be adored as divinities.
<p>They are like the people the Lord describes in the following words:
<p>When you make charitable donations, do not sound a trumpet before you the way the hypocrites do in the synagogues and the streets in order to be glorified by people. If you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners so people can see them. (<a href="3927/matthew_6_2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>)
<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you close the kingdom of the heavens to people. For you yourselves do not go in, and you do not let others in who are trying to enter. Woe to you hypocrites, because you travel across sea and land to make one convert, and when you have made one, you make that convert two times more a child of hell than you are. Woe to you hypocrites, because you clean the outside of the cup and plate but the insides are full of plundering and self-indulgence. (<a href="3927/matthew_23_13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">25</a>)
<p>Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites correctly when he said, "This people honors me with its lips, but its heart is far from me. " (<a href="3927/mark_7_6.htm">Mark 7:6</a>)
<p>Woe to you hypocrites, because you are like invisible tombs that people do not know about as they walk over them. (<a href="3927/luke_11_44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>)
<p>And other passages as well.
<p>These people are like pieces of flesh without blood. They are like crows or parrots that have been taught to say the words of some Psalm. They are like birds that have been taught to sing the melody of some sacred hymn. The sound of their talking is like a hunter's birdcall. </p>

452. Hypocritical charity, however, is characteristic of those who in church or at home bow before God almost touching the paving stones, pour out long devotional prayers, keep solemn faces, kiss crucifixes and the bones of the dead, and then genuflect towards their tombs, muttering over them phrases expressing holy veneration of God, while yet turning over in their hearts the worship of themselves, and addressing to themselves adoration as if to divine powers. These people resemble those whom the Lord describes in these words:<p>When you give alms, do not have a trumpet sound before you, as hypocrites do in synagogues and in the streets, to get glory from men. And if you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites, who like to pray standing up in synagogues and at street-corners, so that people can see them, <a href="3927/matthew_6_2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>.<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of the heavens in men's sight, since you do not go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who want to go in to do so. Woe to you, hypocrites, because you tour sea and dry land to make one proselyte; and when you have got one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves. Woe to you, you hypocrites, because you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but the insides are full of robbery and intemperance, <a href="3927/matthew_23_13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">25</a>.<p>Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you, you hypocrites, saying, This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, <a href="3927/mark_7_6.htm">Mark 7:6</a>.<p>Woe to you, you hypocrites, because you are like hidden tombs, so that people walking over them are unaware, <a href="3927/luke_11_44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>.<p>There are other passages too. These people are like flesh without blood, or like ravens and parrots which have been taught to repeat the words from a psalm; and like birds trained to sing the tune of a religious hymn. The sound of their speech is like the sound of a fowler's lure. </p>

452. But hypocritical charity is the charity of those who in their churches and private dwellings humble themselves almost to the floor before God, devoutly pour forth long prayers, put on a holy expression of countenance, kiss images of the cross and the bones of the dead, and kneel beside sepulchres and there with their mouths mutter words of holy veneration for God, and yet in their heart they are thinking of being themselves worshiped and seeking to be adored as divinities. It is such as these whom the Lord describes in the following words: <p>When thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men (<a href="3927/matthew_6_2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>). <p>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye shut up the kingdom of heaven before men; for ye enter not in yourselves, neither do ye suffer those to enter who wish to enter. Woe unto you, hypocrites! For ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves. Woe unto you, hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are filled with extortion and excess (<a href="3927/matthew_23_13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">25</a>). <p>Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you, hypocrites, saying, This people honoreth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me (<a href="3927/mark_7_6.htm">Mark 7:6</a>). <p>Woe unto you, hypocrites! For ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them know it not (<a href="3927/luke_11_44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>). <p>Beside other passages. Such are like flesh without blood, like crows and parrots taught to repeat the words of a psalm, and like birds taught to sing the tune of a sacred hymn; and the sound of their voice is like that of a bird-catcher's whistle. </p>

452. Charity is hypocritical with those who in public and in private worship bow down almost to the ground before God, devoutly pour forth long prayers, wear a sanctimonious expression and kiss crucifixes and the bones of the dead. At times they kneel at burial places, and there utter words of holy veneration of God; and yet in their heart their thoughts are of self-worship, and their desire is to be adored as deities. They resemble those whom the Lord describes in these words:<p>"When thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men... And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men" <a href="3927/matthew_6_2.htm">Matthew 6:2-5</a>.<p>"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in... Woe unto you,... hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell than yourselves... Woe unto you... hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess." <a href="3927/matthew_23_1.htm">Matthew 23</a> [<a href="3927/matthew_23_13.htm">13</a>], <a href="3927/matthew_23_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">25</a>.<p>"Well hath Esaias prophesied of you, saying, This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me" <a href="3927/mark_7_6.htm">Mark 7:6</a>.<p>"Woe unto you... hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them" <a href="3927/luke_11_44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>;<p>and elsewhere. Such persons are like flesh without blood, or like ravens and parrots taught to repeat the words of a psalm, or like birds taught to sing the air of a sacred hymn; the sound of their speech is like the sound of a bird-catcher's pipe. </p>

452. Charitas autem HYPOCRITICA est apud illos qui in Templis et Domibus humiliant se paene ad pavimentum coram Deo, longas preces devote fundunt, vultus Sanctos praeferunt, osculantur imagines crucis, et ossa mortuorum, et nunc ad sepulchra flectunt genua, et ibi mussitant ore verba sanctae venerationis Dei, et tamen corde volvunt cultum sui, et intendunt adorationes sicut numinum. Hi sunt similes illis, quos Dominus describit, his verbis, Quando feceris eleemosynas, ne tuba canas ante te, quemadmodum Hypocritae faciunt in Synagogis et in vicis, ut glorificentur ab hominibus: et si oraveris, non eris sicut Hypocritae, qui amant in Synagogis et in Angulis platearum stantes orare, ut conspiciantur ab hominibus, <a href="3927/matthew_6_2.htm">Matthaeus 6:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_6_5.htm">5</a>. Vae vobis Scribae et Pharisaei, hypocritae, quia clauditis Regnum coelorum coram hominibus, vos enim non intratis, nec eos, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
qui intrare volunt, permittitis intrare. Vae vobis Hypocritae, quia circumitis mare et aridam, ut faciatis unum proselytum, et cum factus est, facitis illum filium gehennae duplo magis quam vos. Vae vobis Hypocritae, quia purgatis exterius poculi et patinae, interiora vero plena sunt rapina et intemperantia, <a href="3927/matthew_23_13.htm">Matthaeus 23:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">25</a>. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>

Vae vobis HYPOCRITAE, quia estis sicut Monumenta non apparentia, ut homines, qui ambulant super ea, non sciant, <a href="3927/luke_11_44.htm">Luca 11:44</a> praeter alibi.
