<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第二诫  不可妄称耶和华你神的名；因为妄称耶和华名的，耶和华必不以他为无罪</h4><br />297.就属世之义或字义而言，“妄称耶和华神之名”表示在以下情形中滥用名字本身：各种交谈，尤其是说假话或撒谎；没有好的动机或为了开脱罪责而发誓；邪恶的意图，也就是诅咒；巫术与占卜。另一方面，在加冕礼、牧职授任、或就职典礼中奉神及其神圣，以及圣言和福音书之名起誓，并非妄称神之名，除非随后起誓之人认为其承诺没有价值了而加以弃绝。神之名就是神圣本身，故而经常被用于教会的圣事中，例如在祷告、赞美和各种形式的敬拜中，又如在有关宗教主题的讲道和着述中。这是因为神存在于关乎宗教信仰的一切事物中，当适时呼求祂时，祂的名就能召来祂的临在，祂也会聆听。神的名以这些方式被神圣化。<br />耶和华神之名的神圣，可从耶和华之名得以证实，因为犹太人从最早期开始直至今日，都不称呼、甚至不敢说出耶和华的名字。鉴于此，福音书的作者和使徒们也不愿直呼其名。因此，他们用“主”代替“耶和华”。这一点从新约所引用旧约中的大量经文明显可知，在这些经文中，“主”取代了“耶和华”。例如，《马太福音》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">22:37</a>），《路加福音》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.37.htm">10:37</a>）对比《申命记》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.5.htm">6:5</a>）等等。<br />众所周知，耶稣之名同样神圣，因为使徒说：<br />叫一切在天上的、地上的和地底下的，因耶稣的名无不屈膝。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/腓2.10.htm">腓立比书2:10</a>）<br />而且，地狱里的魔鬼无法说出耶稣之名。神之名有很多，都不可妄称，如耶和华、耶和华神、万军之耶和华、以色列的圣者、耶稣和基督、以及圣灵等。</p>

297. 第二誡 不可妄稱耶和華你上帝的名
<p>因為妄稱耶和華名的, 耶和華必不以他為無罪。
<p>就屬世之義,也就是文字之義而言, 妄稱耶和華上帝之名表示在各種場合談話在濫用耶和華之名, 特別是用於撒謊和欺詐, 以及為了辯解或推脫指責而發誓; 甚至用於邪惡之目的, 諸如詛咒,巫術與魔法咒語等。
<p>另一方面, 在對祭司職份的加冕,授任聖職,或堅定信仰的儀式中奉上帝之名及其神聖來起誓, 並非妄稱上帝之名, 除非起誓之人隨後棄絕其承諾或視之無用。
<p>還有, 上帝之名, 因其為神聖之本, 經常被用於教會的聖事之中, 例如在禱告,讚美和各種形式的敬拜中, 而且還在宗教課題的講道和著述中。這是因為上帝在宗教信仰的所有事務之中, 當祂被呼求其名時, 祂會垂聽並臨格。在這些活動中, 上帝之名被尊為聖。
<p>耶和華上帝之名的原本神聖, 你可以從此看出:猶太人從最早期開始直至今日, 都不稱呼,甚至不敢說出耶和華的名字。出於對猶太人的尊重, 福音書的作者和使徒們也未直呼其名。代替"耶和華"之名, 他們說"主"。這可明顯從新約引用舊約的幾句經文看出, 在那裡"主"用來代替"耶和華"。例如, 請見<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">馬太福音22:37</a>, Matthew 22:<a href="3927/luke_10_37.htm">路加福音10:37</a>與<a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">申命記6:5</a>, Deuteronomy 6: 等等。
<p>眾所周知, 耶穌之名同樣神聖, 因為使徒說:天上地上因耶穌之名無不屈膝(<a href="3927/philippians_2_10.htm">腓立比書2:10</a>)。另外, 地獄之中任何魔鬼都無法說出耶穌之名。
<p>上帝之名有許多, 都不可妄稱:耶和華,耶和華上帝,萬軍之耶和華,以色列聖者,耶穌,基督,聖靈等。 </p>

297. The Second Commandment
<p>You Are Not to Take the Name of Jehovah Your God
<p>in Vain, Because Jehovah Will Not Hold Guiltless
<p>Someone Who Takes His Name in Vain
<p>In its earthly meaning, which is the literal meaning, taking the name of Jehovah God in vain includes abusing his name in various types of talking, especially in lies and deceptions, in swearing and oath-taking for no reason or to avoid blame; and using his name with evil intent, which is cursing, or in sorcery and magic spells.
<p>To swear by God or by his holiness, by the Word or by the Gospel during coronations, inaugurations into the priesthood, and confirmations of faith is not taking God's name in vain, unless the people who take the oath later reject their promises as impossible or pointless.
<p>Furthermore, because it is holiness itself, the name of God is used constantly in the sacred activities of the church, such as in prayers, hymns, and all aspects of worship, as well as in sermons and books on church-related topics. The reason is that God is in every aspect of religion. When he is ritually called forth by his name, he is present and hears. In these activities the name of God is kept holy.
<p>The name of Jehovah God is intrinsically holy, as you can see by the fact that after their earliest times the Jews did not dare, nor do they now dare, to say the name Jehovah. Out of respect for the Jews, the Gospel writers and apostles did not want to say the name either. Instead of "Jehovah" they said "the Lord," as you can see from passages from the Old Testament that are quoted in the New Testament but use "the Lord" instead of "Jehovah," such as <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a> and <a href="3927/luke_10_27.htm">Luke 10:27</a> that quote <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, and so on.
<p>The name of Jesus is also holy, as people generally know because the apostle said that at that name knees bend and should bend in heaven and on earth [<a href="3927/philippians_2_10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>]. For another thing, no devil in hell can pronounce the name Jesus.
<p>There are many names for God that are not to be taken in vain: Jehovah, Jehovah God, Jehovah Sabaoth, the Holy One of Israel, Jesus, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. </p>

297. THE SECOND COMMANDMENT<p>You are not to take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold anyone guiltless, who takes His name in vain.<p>Taking the name of Jehovah God in vain means in the natural or literal sense the misuse of the name itself in all sorts of conversation, especially false statements or lies, and in swearing without good cause, or in order to avoid being blamed, in evil intentions, which are curses, and in witchcraft and spells. On the other hand, swearing by God and His holiness, the Word and the Gospel, at coronations, ordination into the priesthood, or inauguration into offices of trust, is not taking the name of God in vain, unless the one who takes the oath subsequently rejects his promises as worthless. The name of God, being holiness itself, is to be constantly employed in the sacred business of the church, as in prayers, hymns and all forms of worship, as well as in sermons and writings on religious subjects. This is because God is present in everything to do with religion, and when He is duly invoked, His presence is summoned by His name, and He listens. In these ways the name of God is hallowed.</p>
<p>
[2] The sanctity of the name of Jehovah God can be established from the name of Jehovah, which the Jews after their earliest period did not, and still do not, dare to utter; and on their account no more were the Evangelists and Apostles willing to use it. Therefore in place of Jehovah they said 'the Lord'. This is evident from a number of passages of the Old Testament quoted in the New, where 'the Lord' is substituted for Jehovah; e.g, <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_27.htm">Luke 10:27</a> compared with <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, and elsewhere. It is well known that the name of Jesus is likewise holy, from the Apostle's saying that at that name every knee does and should bow in the heavens and on earth; and moreover that it cannot be uttered by any devil in hell. There are many names of God which are not to be taken in vain, such as Jehovah, Jehovah God, Jehovah Zebaoth, the Holy One of Israel, Jesus and Christ, and the Holy Spirit. </p>

297. THE SECOND COMMANDMENT. <p>THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF JEHOVAH THY GOD IN VAIN; FOR JEHOVAH WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS THAT HATH TAKEN HIS NAME IN VAIN. <p>In the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, to take the name of Jehovah God in vain means the name itself, and its abuse in various kinds of conversation, especially in false speaking or lying, and in useless oaths or oaths to exculpate one's self in evil intentions (that is, oaths with imprecations), also when employed in juggleries and incantations. But to swear by God and His holiness, by the Word or the Gospel, at coronations, inaugurations into the priesthood, and inductions into offices of trust, is not to take the name of God in vain, unless he who takes the oath afterwards discards his promises as vain. But the name of God, because it is holiness itself, must be used continually in the holy things pertaining to the church, as in prayers, psalms, and all worship, also in preaching, and in writing on ecclesiastical subjects. This is so because God is in all things of religion, and when He is solemnly invoked He is present through His name and hears. In such ways is the name of God hallowed. That the name of Jehovah God is in itself holy is evident from that name, in that the Jews since their earliest age have not dared and do not dare to utter the name Jehovah; and for their sake the writers of the Gospels and the apostles were unwilling to use it, and used the name Lord instead, as is evident from various passages transferred from the Old Testament into the New, where the name Lord is used instead of Jehovah (as in <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>, compared with<a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and other passages). That the name of Jesus is in like manner holy is known from the saying of the Apostle that at this name every knee is bowed or should be bowed in heaven and on earth; and furthermore from this, that no devil in hell can utter that name. There are many names of God that must not be taken in vain, as Jehovah, Jehovah God, and Jehovah of Hosts; the Holy One of Israel, Jesus and Christ, and the Holy Spirit. </p>

THE SECOND COMMANDMENT<p>THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF JEHOVAH THY GOD IN VAIN; FOR JEHOVAH WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS THAT TAKETH HIS NAME IN VAIN.<p>In the natural sense, which is the sense of the Letter, this commandment means not only taking the name itself in vain, but also mis-using it in various forms of conversation, especially in falsehoods or lies, in taking oaths unnecessarily or to free oneself from blame of having evil intentions-oaths which are mere imprecations-and in sorceries and incantations. To swear, however, by God and His holiness, by the Word and the Gospel, at coronations, inaugurations into the priesthood, and on appointments to positions of trust, is not to take the name of God in vain, unless he who swears, afterwards breaks his engagements. Moreover, the name of God, being itself holy, must be used constantly in the holy offices of the Church, as in prayers, hymns, and in every act of worship; and also in preaching, and in writing on ecclesiastical subjects. For God is in everything that pertains to religion; and when He is solemnly invoked He is present by means of His name, and hears; in these things the name of God is hallowed.<p>That the name of Jehovah God is in itself holy the very name makes evident, for the Jews, from their earliest days, have not dared to say "Jehovah;" and for their sake neither the Evangelists nor the Apostles would mention it.

habebit Jehovah, qui sumserit Nomen Ipsius in vanum.<p>297Per sumere Nomen Jehovae Dei in vanum, in SENSU NATURALI, qui est Sensus literae, intelligitur ipsum Nomen, et Ejus abusus in variis colloquiis, imprimis in falsiloquiis seu mendaciis, inque juramentis absque causa <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>

Nomen autem Dei, quia est ipsum Sanctum, jugiter usurpandum est in rebus Sanctis quae Ecclesiae sunt, ut in Orationibus, Psalmis, et in omni Cultu, et quoque in Praedicationibus, et in Scriptis de rebus Ecclesiasticis; causa est, quia Deus est in omnibus Religionis, et cum rite invocatur, per Nomen suum praesens est, et audit; in his Nomen Dei sanctificatur.</p>

[2] Quod Nomen Jehovae Dei in se sanctum sit, constat ex Nomine illo, quod Judaei post primum tempus eorum non ausi sint, nec audeant, Jehovam dicere, et quod propter illos nec Evangelistae et Apostoli voluerint, quare loco Jehovae dixerunt Dominum, ut constat ex variis locis ex Veteri <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
