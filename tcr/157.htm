<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>157</b>.由于人的灵就是他的心智，所以圣言中经常出现“在灵里”这个短语，它是指心智出体（即脱离肉体）的状态。先知们就是在这种状态下看见发生在灵界的事，即所谓“神的异象”。此时先知所在的状态，跟灵界的灵人与天使的状态是一样的。在这种状态下，人的灵如同其心智的视觉，能转向各个地方，而他的身体却仍留在原来的地方。<br />这就是我过去二十六年来所处的状态，不同之处在于，我既在灵里，同时也在肉体中，只是有时会出体。<br />以西结、撒迦利亚、但以理和写启示录的约翰都曾处在这样的状态，这从下列经文明显可知：<br />以西结说：灵将我举起，在异象中借着神的灵，将我带回迦勒底，到被掳的人那里，我所见的异象就离我上升去了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.1.htm">以西结书11:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.24.htm">24</a>）灵将我举起，我就听见在我身后有震动。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.12.htm">以西结书3:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.14.htm">14</a>）<br />灵就将我举到天地中间，带我到耶路撒冷，我看到可憎的事。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.3.htm">以西结书8:3</a>）<br />我看见四个活物，是基路伯，以及他们的各种形状。（以西结书1 和10章）<br />还看见一个新地和新殿，以及丈量它们的一位天使。（以西结40－48章）<br />那时，他在异象中，在灵里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.2.htm">以西结书40:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.5.htm">13:5</a>）<br />撒迦利亚：<br />他与一位天使在一起时，见一人骑着马，站在石榴树中间。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.8.htm">撒迦利亚书1:8</a>）<br />四角，一人手拿准绳。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.18.htm">撒迦利亚书1:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.1.htm">2:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.2.htm">2</a>）<br />大祭司约书亚。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚3.1.htm">撒迦利亚书3:1</a>）<br />灯台和两棵橄榄树。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.1.htm">撒迦利亚书4:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.3.htm">3</a>）<br />一飞行的书卷和量器。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.1.htm">撒迦利亚书5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.6.htm">6</a>）<br />四辆车从两山中间出来，以及马匹。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.1.htm">撒迦利亚书6:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.3.htm">3</a>）<br />但以理也处于类似状态，他看见：<br />从海中上来的四个大兽，以及关于它们的许多细节。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.1.htm">但以理书7:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.8.htm">8</a>）<br />公绵羊与公山羊的战斗。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.1.htm">但以理书8:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.14.htm">14</a>）<br />他异象中看见所有这些事（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.1.htm">但以理书7:1</a>；2，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.2.htm">8:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.8.htm">8</a>）；天使加百列在异象中向他显现，并与他交谈（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.21.htm">但以理书9:21</a>）。<br />约翰在写启示录遇到同样的情形，他说：<br />当主日，他在灵里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.10.htm">启示录1:10</a>）<br />他在灵里被带到旷野。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.3.htm">启示录17:3</a>）<br />他在灵里被带到一座高大的山。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">启示录21:10</a>）<br />他在异象中观看。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.17.htm">启示录9:17</a>）<br />还有，他看见他所描述的事物，如他看见人子在七个灯台中间；天上的圣所、圣殿、约柜和祭坛；被七个印封住的书卷，有马从中出来；宝座周围有四活物；来自各支派的一万二千选民；锡安山上的羔羊；从深坑里飞上来的蝗虫；龙以及他与米迦勒的战斗；妇人生了一个男孩子，被龙逼到旷野；两个兽，一个从海中上来，另一个从地中上来；一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上；龙被扔进硫磺的火湖里；白马与盛筵；圣城耶路撒冷降下，以及他所描述的圣城的城门、城墙、根基；生命水的河，每月都结果子的生命树，等等。彼得、雅各和约翰看到耶稣变像时，也处在类似状态，保罗从天上听到不可思议的事时亦是。</p>

157. 由於人的靈表示他的思想, 聖言中經常出現的"在靈裡", 就表示思想與身體分離時的狀態。在這種狀態下, 先知們看到各種心靈世界中的事物, 因此這種狀態被稱為"上帝的異象"。他們与心靈世界中的靈和天人所處的狀態相同。在那樣的狀態下, 人的靈可以從一處到另處, 而身體停留在一處。
<p>我自己處在這種狀態已有二十六年之久, 不同之處在於, 我同時在我的靈和我的身體之中, 只是有時離開我的身體。
<p>以西結,撒迦利亞,但以理和約翰(當他寫『啟示錄』時)曾處在這樣的狀態, 從下列經文可明顯看出:以西結說:"靈將我舉起, 將我在異象中藉著上帝的靈,帶進迦勒底地,到被虜的人那裡; 我所看見的異象就離開我上升去了"(<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">以西結書11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>)。靈將以西結舉起, 他聽到後面地震動(<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">以西結書3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">14</a>)。靈將他舉天地之間, 帶他到耶路撒冷, 他看到可憎之事(<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">以西結書8:3-4</a>)。以西結看見四個活物, 是基路伯, 以及他們不同的樣子(以西結書 1, 10); 來看到一個新的地方和一個新的殿, 一個天人在丈量(以西結書 40, 48)。那時, 他在異象中, 在靈裡(<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">以西結書40:2</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_5.htm">13:5</a>)。
<p>[2]類似的事情也發生在撒迦利亞身上, 當他與一個天人在一起時, 看見有一人騎馬在石榴樹中間(<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">撒迦利亞書1:8</a>); 四個角(<a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">撒迦利亞書1:18</a>); 一個人手拿準繩(<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">撒迦利亞書2:1-2</a>); 大祭司約書亞(<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">撒迦利亞書3:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_3_6.htm">6</a>); 四駕馬車從兩山之間駛出, 它們的馬(<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">撒迦利亞書6:1-3</a>)。
<p>當但以理看到海裡上來四個獸以及關於它們的許多細節, 也在這樣的狀態(<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">但以理書7:1-8</a>);綿羊與山羊的戰鬥(<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">但以理書8:1-14</a>); 當他見到這些事時, 他在異象中(<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">但以理書7:1</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>); 在異象中, 他看到天人迦百列並與他說話(Daniel 8:15-27)。
<p>[3]約翰寫『啟示錄』時, 也是一樣。他說, 在主日他在靈裡(<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">啟示錄1:10</a>); 他在靈裡被帶到曠野(<a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">啟示錄17:3</a>); 在靈裡, 他在一座高山上(<a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">啟示錄21:10</a>); 他在異象中看見一些事情(<a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">啟示錄9:17</a>)。
<p>『啟示錄』別處, 約翰還說, 他看到了所寫之事, 例如看到人子在七個燈檯當中; 看到天上有聖所,聖殿,約櫃和祭壇; 看到書卷有七印, 看到馬駛出; 四活物圍繞寶座; 來自各支派的十四萬四千選民; 錫安山上的羔羊; 深坑裡上來的蝗蟲; 龍與米迦勒戰鬥; 婦人要生子, 被龍逼到曠野; 兩個獸, 一個從海裡來, 一個從地裡來; 坐在朱紅色獸上的淫婦; 龍被扔進硫磺火湖; 白馬與盛筵; 聖城耶路撒冷降下, 以及聖城的入口,城牆,牆的根基; 生命河; 每月產不同果子的生命樹, 等等。
<p>彼得,雅各和約翰看到耶穌變像時, 也處於相同的狀態, 保羅在路上聽到天上聲音, 也是如此。 </p>

157. Since our spirit means our mind, therefore "being in the spirit," as the Word sometimes says, refers to the state of our mind when it is separated from our body. In this state the prophets saw the sort of things that exist in the spiritual world; therefore this state is called "a vision of God. " At those times, the prophets' state was like the state of spirits and angels in the spiritual world. In this state our spirit can move from place to place while our body stays where it is (as is also true of our mind's eye).
<p>This is the state I myself have been in now for twenty-six years, with the difference that I am in my spirit and my body at the same time, and only sometimes out of my body.
<p>Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel, and John (when he wrote the Book of Revelation) were in this state, as is clear from the following passages: Ezekiel said, "The spirit lifted me up and led me into Chaldea to the captivity in the vision of God, in the spirit of God. In this way the vision that I saw came over me" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>). The spirit lifted Ezekiel up and he heard the earth tremble behind him (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">14</a>). The spirit lifted him up between earth and heaven, and led him away to Jerusalem where he saw abominable things (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3-4</a>). He saw four creatures that were angel guardians and various details about them (Ezekiel 1 and 10). Then he saw a new earth in the form of a new temple, and an angel measuring the temple (Ezekiel 40-48). At that time he was in a vision and in the spirit (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">43:5</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] The same thing happened to Zechariah when an angel was with him and he saw a man riding among the myrtle trees (); when he saw four horns and a man who had a string in his hand for measuring (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1-2</a>); when he saw Joshua the high priest (<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_3_6.htm">6</a>); and when he saw four chariots with horses headed off between two mountains (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-3</a>).
<p>Daniel was in the same state when he saw four beasts rising up out of the sea, and many details about them (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-8</a>); and when he saw battles between a ram and a goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1-14</a>). He was in a vision when he saw those things (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>). In a vision he saw the angel Gabriel and spoke with him [].
</p>
<p>
[3] The same thing happened to John when he wrote the Book of Revelation. He said he was in the spirit on the Lord's day (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>); he was carried off into the wilderness in the spirit (<a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>); and he was on a high mountain in the spirit (<a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). He was seeing things in a vision (<a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>).
<p>Elsewhere [in the Book of Revelation] he says that he saw the things he described. For example, he saw the Son of Humankind in the middle of seven lampstands. He saw a tabernacle, a temple, an ark, and an altar in heaven; a book sealed with seven seals and horses that came out of it; four creatures around a throne; twelve thousand chosen people, some from every tribe; a lamb on Mount Zion; locusts rising up from an abyss; a dragon and its war with Michael; a woman giving birth to a male child and running away into a desert because of the dragon; two beasts, one rising up out of the sea and another out of the land; a woman sitting on a scarlet beast; a dragon thrown into a lake of fire and sulfur; a white horse and a great supper; the holy city Jerusalem coming down, with details of its entrances, its wall, and the wall's foundations; a river of living water; and trees of life producing different types of fruit every month; and so on.
<p>Peter, James, and John were in the same state when they saw Jesus transfigured, as was Paul when he heard ineffable things from heaven. </p>

157. Since a person's spirit means his mind, 'being in the spirit', a phrase which occurs a number of times in the Word, means the state in which the mind is separated from the body. That was the state the Prophets were in when they saw the kind of things which happen in the spiritual world, so it is called 'the vision of God.' They were then in the same state as that of the spirits and angels of that world. In that state a person's spirit, as the visual capacity of his mind, can be transported from place to place while his body remains in one place. This is the state in which I have been for the last twenty-six years, with the difference that I have been simultaneously in the spirit and in the body, and only at times outside the body. Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel and John the writer of Revelation were evident from the following passages.<p>Ezekiel says: 'A spirit lifted me up, and brought me back to Chaldaea to the captives in a vision, in the spirit of God; so the vision which I had seen went up from me' (<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>). A spirit lifted him up and he heard behind him an earthquake (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">14</a>). A spirit lifted him up between earth and heaven, and carried him off to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>ff). He saw four creatures, which were Cherubim, and various sights with them (Ezek. chapters 1, 10); also a new earth and a new temple, and an angel measuring them (Ezek. chapters 40-48). He was then in receipt of a vision and in the spirit (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_5.htm">13:5</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] Similar things happened to Zechariah, when he was with an angel and saw a man riding a horse among myrtles (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>ff); four horns [<a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>] and a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">5</a>ff); Joshua the high priest (<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>ff); four chariots coming out between two mountains, and their horses (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>ff). Daniel was in the same state when he saw four beasts coming up out of the sea and various other details about them (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>ff); the fights between a ram and a he-goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>ff). He saw these things in a vision (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>); the angel Gabriel appeared to him in a vision and spoke with him (<a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).</p>
<p>
[3] It was the same with John when he wrote Revelation. He says that he was in the spirit on the Lord's day (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>); that he was carried in the spirit into the desert (<a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>); onto a high mountain in the spirit (<a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>); that he saw [horses] in a vision (<a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>). Elsewhere he says that he saw what he described, as for instance the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands; a tabernacle, a temple, an ark and an altar in heaven; a book sealed with seven seals, and horses that came out of it; four creatures around the throne; twelve thousand chosen from each tribe; then the Lamb upon Mount Zion; locusts coming up from the abyss; the dragon and his battle with Michael; a woman bearing a son, and fleeing into the desert because of the dragon; two beasts, one coming up from the sea, the other from the earth; a woman sitting on a scarlet beast; the dragon cast out into a lake of fire and brimstone; a white horse and a great banquet; the Holy City of Jerusalem coming down, with a description of its gates, wall and the foundations of the wall; a river of living water, and trees of life which bear fruit in every month; and much else besides. Peter, James and John were in a similar state when they saw Jesus transfigured; and so was Paul when he heard from heaven things past telling. </p>

157. As man's spirit means his mind, therefore "being in the spirit" (a phrase sometimes used in the Word) means a state of mind separate from the body; and because in that state the prophets saw such things as exist in the spiritual world it is called "a vision of God." The prophets were then in a state like that of spirits and angels themselves in that world. In that state man's spirit like his mind in regard to sight, may be transferred from place to place, the body remaining meanwhile in its own place. This is the state in which I have now been for twenty-six years, with the difference, that I am in the spirit and in the body at the same time, and only at times out of the body. That Ezekiel, Zachariah, Daniel, and John when he wrote the Apocalypse, were in that state is evident from the following passages. Ezekiel says: <p>The spirit lifted me up, and brought me back in vision in the spirit of God into Chaldea, to the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me (Ezek.<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">11:24</a>). <p>That the spirit lifted him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake (Ezek.<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">3:14</a>). <p>That the spirit lifted him up between earth and heaven and brought him to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations (Ezekiel<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">8:3</a>). <p>That he saw four living creatures that were cherubim, and various things with them (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a> <p>Also a new earth and a new temple, and an angel measuring them (Ezekiel<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48:1</a>). <p>That he was then in vision and in the spirit (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">43:5</a>).

[2] It was the same with Zachariah (in whom there was then an angel) when he saw: <p>A man riding among the myrtle trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> seq.); <p>Four horns, and a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">5</a> seq.); <p>Joshua the high priest (<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>); <p>The lampstand and two olive trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>); <p>A flying roll and an ephah (Zech.<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); <p>Four chariots going out from between two mountains, and horses (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-3</a>). <p>Daniel was in a like state: <p>When he saw the four great beasts coming up from the sea, and many things respecting them (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-12</a>); <p>When he saw the battles between the ram and the he-goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1-12</a>); <p>All of which he saw in vision (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7, 8</a>); The angel Gabriel appeared to him in vision and talked with him (<a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] The same occurred to John when he wrote the Apocalypse; he said: <p>That he was in the spirit on the Lord's day (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">1:10</a>); <p>That he was carried away in the spirit into the wilderness (<a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a>); <p>Upon a high mountain in spirit (<a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">21:10</a>); <p>That he saw in vision (<a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">9:17</a>); <p>and elsewhere that he saw the things he described; as when he saw the Son of man in the midst of the seven lampstands; the tabernacle, the temple, the ark and the altar, in heaven; a book sealed with seven seals, and horses going out of it; four living creatures around the throne; the twelve thousand elect from each tribe; the Lamb on Mount Zion; the locusts ascending from the abyss; the dragon, and his combat with Michael; the woman bringing forth a male child, and fleeing into the desert on account of the dragon; the two beasts, one ascending out of the sea and the other out of the earth; the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast; the dragon cast into the lake of fire and brimstone; the white horse and the great supper; the holy city Jerusalem descending, the gates, walls, and foundations of which he described; the river of the water of life, and the trees of life bearing fruit every month; and many other things. Peter, James, and John were in a like state when they saw Jesus transfigured, and Paul when he heard from heaven things ineffable. </p>

157. Since by the spirit of man is meant his mind, therefore "being in the spirit," a phrase which sometimes occurs in the Word, means a state of the mind separate from the body; and as the prophets, when in that state, saw such things as exist in the spiritual world, that state is called "the vision of God." Their state was then like that of spirits themselves and angels in that world; and in that state a man's spirit, like his mind as to sight, may be transferred from place to place, while the body remains in its own place. In this state I have now been for twenty-six years, with this difference, that I have been in the spirit and in the body at the same time, and only occasionally out of the body. Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel, and John when he wrote the Book of Revelation, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
were in that state, as is evident from the following passages. Ezekiel says:<p>"The spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me" <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>.<p>The spirit took him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The spirit lifted him up between the earth and the heaven, and brought him to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations <a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, and following verses.<p>He saw four living creatures, which were cherubs, and various things with them, <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">1</a> and <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>;<p>and a new earth, and a new temple, and an angel measuring them, <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40</a> to <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>.<p>That he was then in vision, and in the spirit, appears from <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>, and <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] The case was the same with Zechariah, with whom there was then an angel, when he saw:<p>"A man riding among the myrtle-trees," <a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">1:8</a>, and following verses; four horns, <a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">1:18</a>; and a man with a measuring line in his hand, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">5</a>; and following verses.<p>Joshua the high priest, <a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">3:1</a>; a flying roll, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">5:1-6</a>,<p>and four chariots and horses coming out from between two mountains <a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">6:1</a>, and following verses.<p>Daniel was in a similar state when he saw four beasts come up from the sea, and many things relating to them <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-3</a>;<p>and when he saw the battles of the ram and the goat, <a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a> and following verses.<p>That he saw those things in vision is declared in <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>.<p>The angel Gabriel appeared to him in vision, and talked with him, <a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] John experienced the same when he wrote the Rook of Revelation, for he says he "was in the Spirit on the Lord's day" <a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>;<p>that he was "carried away in the spirit into the wilderness" <a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>;<p>and "to a great and high mountain" in the spirit, <a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>: that he saw "in the vision," <a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>;<p>and in other places that "he saw" what he described, as the Son of Man in the midst of the seven candlesticks, a tabernacle, a temple, an ark and an altar in heaven; the book sealed with seven seals, and horses going out of it; four animals around the throne; the twelve thousand chosen out of each tribe; the Lamb on Mount Sion; locusts ascending from the bottomless pit; the dragon and his war with Michael; <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
the woman bringing forth a male child, and fleeing into the wilderness on account of the dragon; two beasts, one ascending out of the sea and the other out of the earth; the woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast; the dragon cast into a lake of fire and brimstone; a white horse and a great supper; the descent of the Holy City Jerusalem, whose gates, walls and foundations he described; the river of the water of life, and the trees of life bearing fruit every month; and many other things. Peter, James and John were in a similar state when they saw Jesus transfigured; and Paul also, when he heard ineffable words from heaven.<p>

157. Quoniam per Spiritum hominis intelligitur Mens ejus, ideo per ESSE IN SPIRITU, quod aliquoties in Verbo dicitur, intelligitur status mentis separatae a corpore, et quia in illo statu Prophetae viderunt talia, quae in Mundo Spirituali existunt, ideo vocatur ille Visio Dei; status ille fuit tunc illis, qualis est ipsis Spiritibus et Angelis in illo Mundo; in illo statu spiritus hominis, sicut mens ejus quoad visum, transferri potest e loco in locum, manente corpore in suo. Hic status est, in quo ego nunc per 26 annos fueram, cum discrimine, quod in spiritu et simul in corpore, et modo aliquoties extra corpus. Quod Ezechiel, Sacharias, Daniel, et Johannes cum scripsit Apocalypsin, in illo statu fuerint, constat ex sequentibus; dicit EZECHIEL, "Spiritus sustulit me, et reduxit me in Chaldaeam ad Captivitatem in VISIONE DEI, in SPIRITU DEI, ita ascendit super me VISIO, quam vidi," <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>.

Quod sustulerit illum Spiritus inter Terram et Coelum, et abduxerit Hierosolymam, et viderit abominationes, <a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">8:3</a>, seq. Quod viderit quatuor Animalia, quae erant Cherubi, et varia apud illos, Cap. <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">1</a> et Cap. <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>: Tum novam Terram et novum Templum, et Angelum metientem illa, Cap. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40</a> ad <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>, quod tunc fuerit in Visione et in Spiritu, Cap. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">40:2</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">43:5</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
