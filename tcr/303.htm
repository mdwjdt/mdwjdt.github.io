<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>303</b>.就属天之义而言，这条诫命表示与主结合，由于出离地狱得到保护而通向平安。安息表示休息，在至高义上表示“平安”（peace）。因此，主被称为“和平之君”，祂称祂自己为平安。这从以下经文可以看出来：<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上。祂名称为奇妙、策士、全能的神、永在的父、和平的君。祂的政权与平安必加增无穷。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">以赛亚书9:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.7.htm">7</a>）<br />耶稣说：“我留下平安给你们，我将我的平安赐给你们”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.27.htm">约翰福音14:27</a>）<br />耶稣说：“我将这些事告诉你们，是要叫你们在我里面有平安”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.33.htm">约翰福音16:33</a>）<br />那报佳音，传平安，报好信，传救恩的，对锡安说：“你的神作王了！”这人的脚登山何等佳美。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.7.htm">以赛亚书52:7</a>）<br />耶和华救赎我命，使我得享平安。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗55.18.htm">诗篇55:18</a>）<br />公义的果效必是平安；公义的效验必是平稳，直到永远。我的百姓，必住在平安的居所、安稳的住处、平静的安歇所。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.17.htm">以赛亚书32:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.18.htm">18</a>）<br />耶稣对所差遣的七十人说：“无论进哪一家，先要说：‘愿这一家平安。’那里若有当得平安的人，你们所求的平安就必临到那家”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.5.htm">路加福音10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.12.htm">马太福音10:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.14.htm">14</a>）<br />耶和华将平安赐给祂的百姓；公义与平安彼此相亲。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗85.8.htm">诗篇85:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗85.10.htm">10</a>）当主自己向门徒们显示时，祂说：“愿你们平安”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.19.htm">约翰福音20:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.26.htm">26</a>）<br />而且，《以赛亚书》（65，66章等）论述了主把他们所带入的平安状态。将被带入这种状态的人就是那些被接纳到新教会，也就是主当前正在建立的新教会之人。从《天堂与地狱》（284－290节）一书可以看出，天堂天人和那些在主内之人所享有这种平安，其本质如何。综上所述，明显可知为何主称祂自己为安息日之主，也就是安息与平安之主。</p>

303. 這條誡命的屬天之義所指的, 是與主連接帶來的平安, 因為我們離地獄得保護。安息表示休息, 最高層的含義指"平安"(peace)。因此, 主被稱為"和平之君"。可參看以下經文:
<p>因有一嬰孩為我們而生, 有一子賜給我們, 政權必擔在祂的肩頭上。祂名稱為奇妙,策士,全能的上帝,永在的父,和平的君。祂的政權與平安必加增無窮(<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">以賽亞書9:6-7</a>)。耶穌說:"我留下平安給你們, 我將我的平安賜給你們"(<a href="3927/john_14_27.htm">約翰福音14:27</a>)。耶穌說:"我將這些事告訴你們, 是要叫你們在我裡面有平安"(<a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">約翰福音16:33</a>)。那報佳音, 傳平安, 報好信, 傳救恩的, 對錫安說:"你的上帝作王了！"這人的腳登山何等佳美(<a href="3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">以賽亞書52:7</a>)。耶和華救贖我命, 使我得享平安(<a href="3927/psalms_55_18.htm">詩篇55:18</a>)。公義的果效必是平安; 公義的效驗必是平穩, 直到永遠。我的百姓, 必住在平安的居所,安穩的住處,平靜的安歇所(<a href="3927/isaiah_32_17.htm">以賽亞書32:17-18</a>)。耶穌對所差遣的七十人說:"無論進哪一家, 先要說:'願這一家平安。'那裡若有當得平安的人, 你們所求的平安就必臨到那家"(<a href="3927/luke_10_5.htm">路加福音10:5-6</a>;<a href="3927/matthew_10_12.htm">馬太福音10:12-14</a>)。耶和華將平安賜給祂的百姓; 公義與平安彼此相親(<a href="3927/psalms_85_8.htm">詩篇85:8</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_85_10.htm">10</a>)。當主自己向門徒們顯示時, 祂說:"願你們平安"(<a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">約翰福音20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>)。
<p><a href="3927/isaiah_65_1.htm">以賽亞書65</a>及<a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">66</a>章以及其它地方還進一步論述平安的狀態, 也就是人們可以在主的帶領下進入這樣的狀態。將被帶進如此狀態的百姓就是那些被接納進入新教會之人, 就是主當前正建立的全新的教會。(天國之天人以及在主裡面之人所擁有的平安, 其本質如何, 可參看<a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-chinese-2020_284.htm">天國與地獄284-290</a>節。這些章節還闡明了為何主稱自己為安息日之主, 也就是安息與平安之主)。 </p>

303. In the heavenly meaning this commandment refers to connecting to the Lord and having peace as a result, because we are then safe from hell. The Sabbath means "rest," and in the highest sense "peace. " For this reason the Lord is called "the Prince of Peace," and also calls himself peace. See the following passages:
<p>A Child is born to us; a Son is given to us. Authority will rest on his shoulder, and his name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of his government and peace. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "Peace I leave to you. My peace I give to you. " (<a href="3927/john_14_27.htm">John 14:27</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "I have spoken these things so that you may have peace in me. " (<a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>)
<p>How pleasant on the mountains are the feet of the One proclaiming and making us hear peace, saying, "Your king reigns. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>)
<p>Jehovah will redeem my soul in peace. (<a href="3927/psalms_55_18.htm">Psalms 55:18</a>)
<p>The work of Jehovah is peace; the labor of justice is rest and safety forever so that they may live in a dwelling of peace, in tents of safety, and in tranquil rest. (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_17.htm">Isaiah 32:17-18</a>)
<p>Jesus said to the seventy whom he sent out,
<p>Whatever home you come into, first say, "The peace of the Lord," and if the people are children of peace then your peace will rest on them. (<a href="3927/luke_10_5.htm">Luke 10:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_12.htm">Matthew 10:12-14</a>)
<p>Jehovah will speak peace to his people; justice and peace will kiss each other. (<a href="3927/psalms_85_8.htm">Psalms 85:8</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_85_10.htm">10</a>)
<p>When the Lord himself appeared to the disciples he said,
<p>Peace to you. (<a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>)
<p>Isaiah 65 and 66 and other passages treat further the state of peace that people can come into with the Lord's help. The people to be accepted into the new church that the Lord is now establishing are going to come into this peace. (For the essence of the peace that the angels of heaven and those who are in the Lord have, see the work <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_284.htm">Heaven and Hell 284-290</a>. These sections also make it clear why the Lord calls himself the Lord of the Sabbath, that is, the Lord of rest and peace.) </p>

303. In the celestial sense this commandment means being linked with the Lord, leading to peace as the result of protection from hell. The Sabbath means rest and, in this highest sense, peace. That is why the Lord is called the Prince of peace, and He calls Himself peace; this can be seen from the following passages:<p>A child is born for us, a son is given to us, on whose shoulder is the dominion, and his name will be called Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace. Of the extension of his dominion and peace there will be no end, <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<p>Jesus said, I leave peace with you, my peace I give to you, <a href="3927/john_14_27.htm">John 14:27</a>.<p>Jesus said, I have said these things so that you may have peace in me, <a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>.<p>How pleasant upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news and makes us hear of peace, saying, Your God <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

is peace, the toil of righteousness is rest, and safety for ever, so that they may dwell in the dwelling of peace, and in the tents of safety and in tranquil ease, <a href="3927/isaiah_32_17.htm">Isaiah 32:17-18</a>.<p>Jesus said to the seventy whom He sent out, Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be upon this house <sup "fn10_3">3</sup>
; and if there be a son of peace there, let your peace rest upon him, <a href="3927/luke_10_5.htm">Luke 10:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_12.htm">Matthew 10:12-14</a>.<p>Jehovah will speak peace to His people, righteousness and peace will kiss each other, <a href="3927/psalms_85_8.htm">Psalms 85:8</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_85_10.htm">10</a>.<p>When the Lord Himself appeared to the disciples, He said, Peace be with you, <a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>.<p>Moreover, Isaiah (chapters <a href="3927/isaiah_65_1.htm">65</a>-<a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">66</a> and elsewhere) deals with the state of peace, into which the Lord will bring them. The people who will be brought into this state are those who are received into the new church which is being established by the Lord at the present time. It may be seen in my book <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_284.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 284-290</a> what is the essence of this peace enjoyed by the angels of heaven and those who are in the Lord. This reference also makes it plain why the Lord calls Himself the Lord of the Sabbath, that is, of rest and peace.<p>

303. In the celestial sense, this commandment means conjunction with the Lord, followed by peace, because of protection from hell. For the Sabbath signifies rest, and in this highest sense, peace; therefore the Lord is called the Prince of Peace, and He also calls Himself "Peace," as is evident from the following passages: <p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulders; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Mighty, Father of eternity, Prince of Peace.

What peace is in its essence, which is the peace in which the angels of heaven and those who are in the Lord are, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_284.htm">284-290</a>). From all this it is also evident why the Lord called Himself "Lord of the Sabbath," that is, of rest and peace. </p>
