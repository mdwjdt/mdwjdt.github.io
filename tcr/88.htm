<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第88节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>88</b>.尽管神作为神圣真理降下来，但这神圣真理并未与神圣良善分离。这一点从主的孕育明显可知，对此，经上说：<br />至高者的能力荫庇玛利亚。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">路加福音1:35</a>）<br />“至高者的能力”表神圣良善。这一点也可从相关经文得以证实，在这些经文中，主说，父在祂里面，祂在父里面，凡父所拥有的都是祂的，父与祂为一等。“父”表神圣良善。</p>

88. 儘管上帝作為聖理降世, 但聖善並未從聖理分開。從主的受孕情形可看出, 關於這點,我們讀到:"至高者的能力蔭庇瑪利亞"(<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">路加福音1:35</a>)。"至高者的能力"指聖善。
<p>還可從聖言的經句中看到這點, 主常常提到:父在祂裡面, 祂在父裡面, 父的所有都是祂的, 父與祂為一, 等等。"父"的意思也表示聖善。 </p>

88. Although God came down as divine truth, he did not separate the divine goodness from it. This becomes clear from his conception, about which we read that the power of the Highest covered Mary (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>). "The power of the Highest" means the divine goodness.
<p>This also becomes clear from the passages where the Lord says that the Father is in him and he is in the Father, that all things belonging to the Father are his, and that the Father and he are one, and so on. "The Father" means the divine goodness. </p>

88. God's coming down as the Divine Truth but without separating the Divine Good is evident from the Lord's conception, about which we read that 'the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary' (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>). The 'power of the Most High' means the Divine Good. The same point can be established by the passages in which He says that the Father is in Him and He in the Father; that all things of the Father's are His; and that He and the Father are one, and many more. 'Father' means the Divine Good. </p>

<p>
88. That God, although He descended as Divine truth, did not separate therefrom the Divine good, is evident from the conception; of which it is said: <p>That the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>), <p>"the power of the Most High" meaning the Divine good. This is evident also from the passages where He says that the Father is in Him and He in the Father, that all things that the Father hath are His, and that the Father and He are one; also from other passages. By "the Father" the Divine good is meant. </p>

<p>
88. That God, although He descended as the Divine Truth, did not separate the Divine Good is evident from His conception, concerning which it is written that the power of the Highest overshadowed Mary, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>; and by the power of the Highest is signified the Divine Good. The same is also evident from passages where He Himself says that the Father is in Him, and that He is in the Father; that all things which the Father hath are His, and that the Father and He are one; besides many other similar declarations. By the Father is meant the Divine Good. </p>

88. Quod Deus tametsi descendit ut Divinum Verum, usque non separaverit Divinum Bonum, constat ex Conceptione, de qua legitur, quod virtus Altissimi adumbraverit Mariam, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luca 1:35</a>, et per virtutem Altissimi intelligitur Divinum Bonum: idem constat ex locis, ubi Ipse dicit, quod Pater in Ipso sit, et Ipse in Patre; quod omnia Patris sint Ipsius; et quod Pater et Ipse unum sint, praeter plura; per Patrem intelligitur Divinum Bonum. </p>
