817. Roman Catholics in the Spiritual World
<p>The Roman Catholics in the spiritual world appear both around and below the Protestants. The two groups are kept separate from each other by intervening areas that they are forbidden to pass through. There are monks, though, who use secret methods to communicate [with Protestants] and also send emissaries along uncharted paths to lure people into Catholicism, but the emissaries are discovered, punished, and either sent back to their people or cast down. </p>

817. The Roman Catholics in the spiritual world.<p>The Roman Catholics are to be seen in the spiritual world surrounding and below the Protestants. They are kept apart by gaps which they are forbidden to cross. None the less monks employ trickery to establish communication, and also despatch emissaries by little-known routes to seduce people. But they are hunted down, and after being punished are either sent back to their own communities, or cast down. </p>

817. THE PAPISTS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>The Papists in the spiritual world appear round about and beneath the Protestants, and separated from them by inter-spaces which they are forbidden to pass, although the monks by clandestine arts secure for themselves a way through, and also send out emissaries by hidden paths to make converts; but they are traced out, and after being punished, are either sent back to their companions or cast down. </p>

817. VI. ROMAN CATHOLICS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.<p>In the spiritual world the Roman Catholics appear to be situated around and beneath the Protestants, and are separated from them by intervening spaces which they are forbidden to cross. Monks, however, by clandestine methods devise means of communication, and even send emissaries to make converts; but they are found out, and after being punished, are either sent back to their own people or are cast down. </p>

817. DE PONTIFICIIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI.<p>Pontificii in Mundo spirituali apparent circum et infra Protestantes, et per intervalla distincti sunt, quae transire interdictum est; sed usque Monachi per clandestinas artes parant sibi communicationem, et quoque per semitas ignotas ablegant emissarios ut seducant, sed indagantur, et postquam puniti sunt, vel remittuntur ad suos, vel dejiciuntur. </p>
