<p>
536. Nevertheless, all people who do what is good as a religious practice - not only Christians but also non-Christians - are accepted and adopted by the Lord after they die. The Lord says, "'I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. ' And he said, 'As much as you did this to one of the least of my people, you did it to me. Come, you who are blessed, and possess as your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world'" (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34-36</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_40.htm">40</a>).
<p>Here I will add something previously unknown: All people who do good things as a religious practice, after death reject the teaching of the church of today that there are three divine persons who have existed from eternity. They also reject the belief of today's church as it is applied to those three in sequence. Instead they turn themselves to the Lord God the Savior and drink in the teachings of the new church with great pleasure.
</p>
<p>
[2] All others, however, who have not exercised goodwill as a religious practice, have hearts that are as hard as diamonds. At first they worship three gods, then the Father alone, and finally no God. They regard the Lord God the Savior as not the Son of God but only the son of Mary born from her having slept with Joseph. Then they shake themselves free of all the good actions and true insights taught by the new church and soon join up with dragon spirits. Along with these spirits they are driven off into deserts or caves that lie at the outer boundaries of the so-called Christian world. After some time elapses, as a result of their separation from the new heaven they rush into committing crimes and are therefore sent down into hell.
</p>
<p>
[3] This is the final outcome for those who do not do acts of goodwill as a religious practice. They believe that none of us can do anything good on our own unless we do it to earn merit; therefore they omit doing such things. They join up with the goats, who are condemned and thrown into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, because they did not do the things that the sheep did (<a href="3927/matthew_25_41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a> and following). Note that it does not say there that they did evil things; it just says that they did not do good things. People who do good things, but not as a religious practice, actually do evil things, since "No one can serve two lords without hating one and loving the other, and staying close to one and ignoring the other" (<a href="3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). Jehovah says through Isaiah, "Wash yourselves; purify yourselves. Remove the evil of your actions from before my eyes. Stop doing evil. Learn to do what is good. Then, if your sins have been like scarlet, they will become as white as snow. If they have been red as crimson, they will be like wool" (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>). Jehovah says to Jeremiah, "Stand in the entrance to Jehovah's house and proclaim there this word. 'Thus spoke Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel: "Make your ways and your works good. Do not put your trust in the words of a lie, saying, 'The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah is here [that is, the church]. ' When you steal, kill, [commit adultery,] and swear falsely, then do you come and stand before me in this house that carries my name? Do you say, 'We were carried away,' when you are committing all these abominations? Has this house become a den of thieves? Behold, I, even I, have seen it," says Jehovah'" (<a href="3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-4</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>). </p>

<p>
536. Yet all who do good for religious reasons, not only Christians, but also the heathen, are acceptable to the Lord and after death are adopted by Him. For the Lord said:<p>I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and [you took me in; I was naked and] <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
you clothed me; I was sick and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to me. And He said, To the extent that you have done this to one of the least of my brothers, you have done it to me. Come, you blessed ones, and possess as your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world, <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-41</a>.<p>I will add here something new: after death all of those who do good for religious reasons reject the teaching of the present-day church about three Divine persons from eternity, as well as their faith directed to each of the three in turn. Instead they turn to the Lord God the Saviour and with pleasure they take in the teachings of the new church.</p>
<p>
[2] The remainder, however, who have not practised charity for religious reasons are hearts of adamant, so hard they are. These people start by approaching three Gods, then the Father alone, and end by approaching none. They look upon the Lord God the Saviour as merely the son of Mary born of sleeping with Joseph, not as the Son of God; and then they shake off all the kinds of good and truth the new church possesses, Soon afterwards they join the ranks of the spirits of the dragon, and are driven away with them into desert regions or into caves situated at the outermost limits of the so-called Christian world. After some time, because they are separated from the new heaven, they rush into crimes and are therefore sent down to hell.</p>

<p>
[3] Such is the fate of those who have not done charitable deeds for religious reasons, believing that no one can do good of himself without seeking merit. So they leave these deeds undone and join the flock of goats, who are damned and cast into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels, because they have not done as the sheep did (<a href="3927/matthew_25_41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>ff). They are not said in that passage to have done evil, but not to have done good. Those who do good, but without religious reasons, do evil, for<p>No one can serve two masters; either he would hate one and love the other, or hold to the first and neglect the second, <a href="3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>.<p>The Lord says through Isaiah:<p>Wash yourselves, cleanse yourselves, remove the wickedness of your deeds from before my eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do good. Then though your sins were as scarlet, they will become white as snow; though they were red like purple, they will be like wool, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>.<p>He said to Jeremiah:<p>Stand in the gate of Jehovah's house, and there proclaim this word. Thus spoke Jehovah Zebaoth, the God of Israel, Make your ways good and your works also. Put not your trust in lying words, saying, This is Jehovah's Temple, Jehovah's Temple (that is, the church). Will you after stealing, murdering, and swearing falsely, then come and stand in my presence in this house, on which my name is written, and say, We were carried away, when you do all those abominations? Has this house become a robbers' cave? Behold, even I have seen it, this is the word of Jehovah, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-4</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>.<p>

536. And yet all who do good from religion, not only Christians, but even pagans, are accepted and after death adopted by the Lord; for the Lord said: <p>I was an hungered, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink; I was a sojourner, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was sick, and ye visited Me I was in prison, and ye came unto Me. And He said, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of My brethren, even the least, ye did it unto Me. Come, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world (<a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>). <p>To this I will add the following, which is new: All those who do good from religion, after death reject the doctrine of the present church respecting three Divine persons from eternity, and also its faith as applied to the three in their order. These turn to the Lord God the Savior, and accept with pleasure what belongs to the New Church.
</p>
<p>
[2] But the rest, who have not exercised charity from religion, have hearts of adamant, that is, hardened hearts. They first approach three Gods, then the Father alone, and finally no God. They look upon the Lord God the Savior as the son of Mary only, born from marriage with Joseph, and not as the Son of God; and then they discard all the goods and truths of the New Church, and straightway connect themselves with the spirits of the dragon, and with them are driven away into deserts or into caverns on the very confines of what is called the Christian world; and after a time, because they are separated from the New Heaven, they rush into crime, and are therefore sent down to hell.
</p>
<p>
[3] Such is the lot of those who do not do works of charity from religion, because of their belief that no one is able to do good of himself, except such as he claims merit for; consequently they disregard such works, and associate themselves with the goats, who are damned and cast into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels, because they have not done what was done by the sheep (<a href="3927/matthew_25_41.htm">Matthew 25:41-46</a>). It is not there said that they did what is evil, but that they did not do what is good; and those who do not do what is good from religion do what is evil, since: <p>No man can serve two masters; for either he hates the one and loves the other, or he holds to the one and despises the other (<a href="3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). <p>Jehovah says through Isaiah: <p>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; then although your sins have been as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow; although they have been red like crimson, they shall be as wool (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>). <p>And in Jeremiah: <p>Stand in the gate of Jehovah's house, and proclaim there this word, Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, The temple of Jehovah, this is the temple of Jehovah (that is, the church). Will ye steal, murder, and swear falsely, and then come and stand before Me in this house, upon which My name is named, and say, We are delivered while we do all these abominations? Is this house become a den of robbers? Behold, even I have seen it, saith Jehovah (<a href="3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-4</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>). </p>

536. Nevertheless, all who do good from a religious motive, whether Christians or pagans, are accepted by the Lord and received after death; for the Lord said:<p>"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye [took me in: Naked, and ye] clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me." And He said: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me... Come, ye blessed... inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> and following verses.<p>To the above I will add this new fact. All who do good from a religious motive reject after death the doctrine of the present day Church concerning three Divine Persons existing from eternity, and also its faith as it applies to these three in their separate capacities. They turn to the Lord God the Savior, and with joy receive the doctrines of the New Church.</p>
<p>
[2] The rest, however, who have not practiced charity from a religious motive, have thus hardened their hearts till they are now of adamant. These first approach three Gods, afterwards the Father alone, and lastly no God at all. They look upon the Lord God the Savior merely as the son of Mary by her marriage with Joseph, and not as the Son of God. Then they renounce all things of the New Church that are good and true, and presently join the spirits of the dragon, and are driven along with them into desert places or caverns, which lie at the farthest limits of what is called the Christian world. After a time, as they are separated from the New Heaven, they rush into crime, and are therefore, cast into hell.</p>
<p>
[3] Such is the lot of those who do not practice the works of charity from a religious motive, under the belief that no one can do good of himself but what is merit-seeking.

induistis Me; aegrotus fui, et visitastis Me; in custodia fui, et venistis ad Me, et dixit, in quantum fecistis uni ex fratribus meis minimis, Mihi fecistis; venite benedicti, et tanquam haereditatem possidete paratum vobis Regnum a fundatione Mundi," <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthaeus 25:31</a>, seqq. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
