<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>522</b>. 一切邪恶，除非被移走，否则仍存于人内，若人留在自己的恶中，就无法得救，这是不言而喻的。邪恶无法被移走，除非主作用于那些信祂且爱邻舍之人，这一点可通过前面所述，尤其通过有关信的章节明显看出来。主、仁、信构成一体，就象生命、意愿与觉知为一体，若它们分离，各自会象珍珠化为粉末一样消亡。由此可知：主是人内的仁与信，人是主内的仁与信。但有人会问，人怎么才能进入这结合？答复是，除非他通过悔改在某种程度上移走自己的恶，否则他无法进入。我说过，人必须移走邪恶，因为没有人的配合，主就不能直接完成这一切。本章和自由选择那一章都充分说明了这一点。</p>

522. 一切邪恶, 除非被移走, 否则仍存于人内, 若人留在自己的恶中, 就无法得救, 这是不言而喻的。 邪恶无法被移走, 除非主作用于那些信祂且爱邻舍之人, 这一点可通过前面所述, 尤其通过有关信的章节明显看出来。 主, 仁, 信构成一体, 就象生命, 意愿与觉知为一体, 若它们分离, 各自会象珍珠化为粉末一样消亡。 由此可知: 主是人内的仁与信, 人是主内的仁与信。 但有人会问, 人怎么才能进入这结合? 答复是, 除非他通过悔改在某种程度上移走自己的恶, 否则他无法进入。 我说过, 人必须移走邪恶, 因为没有人的配合, 主就不能直接完成这一切。 本章和自由选择那一章都充分说明了这一点。 </p>

522. The rest of the heading is self-evident: every evil remains inside us unless it is laid aside; and if we remain in our evils we cannot be saved. From what has gone before, it is evident that no evil can be laid aside except by the Lord, working in those who believe in him and who love their neighbor. See especially the section in the chapter on faith that teaches that the Lord, goodwill, and faith form a unity in the same way our life, our will, and our intellect form a unity; if we separate them, each one crumbles like a pearl that is crushed to powder [362-367]; and the section that teaches that the Lord is goodwill and faith within us, and we are goodwill and faith within the Lord [368-372].
<p>How can we become part of that unity? We cannot unless we lay aside at least some of our evils through repentance. I say that we lay aside our evils, because the Lord does not lay them aside by himself without our cooperation. This too was fully shown in that same chapter and in the chapter on free choice that follows it. </p>

522. Every evil if not removed remains with a person; and if a person remains in his evils he cannot be saved. This is self-evident. What I have said before makes it obvious that no evil can be removed, except by the Lord working on those who believe in Him and love the neighbour. See especially the sections in the chapter on faith showing that the Lord, charity and faith make one, just as life, will and understanding do, and if they are separated, each of them is destroyed like a pearl collapsing into dust [<a href="362.htm">362-367</a>]. Also the section showing that the Lord is charity and faith in a person, and a person is charity and faith in the Lord [<a href="368.htm">368-372</a>]. But the question may be asked: how can a person enter into that union? The answer is that he cannot, unless he removes his evils, at least partially, by repentance. We say that the person should remove them, because the Lord does not bring this about directly without co-operation on the person's part. This too was fully demonstrated in the same chapter, and in the following one on free will. </p>

522. That all evil, unless removed, remains in man, and that man cannot be saved if he remains in his evils, follows of itself. That no evil can be removed except by the Lord, and except in those who believe in Him and love the neighbor, can be clearly seen from what has already been said, especially from the following in the chapter on Faith. <p>The Lord, charity, and faith make one, like life, will, and understanding, and if they are divided, each perishes like a pearl reduced to powder. <p>And from this: <p>The Lord is charity and faith in man, and man is charity and faith in the Lord. <p>But it is asked, How can man enter into this union? The reply is, that he cannot, unless to some extent he removes his evils by repentance. It is said that man must remove them, because this is not done by the Lord directly, apart from man's co-operation; which is also fully shown in that same chapter, and in that following on Freedom of Choice. </p>

522. That all evil, unless it is removed, remains with a man, and that he cannot be saved if he remains in his evils, are self-evident propositions; and that no evil can be removed except by the Lord, with those who believe on Him and love the neighbor, may be clearly seen from what has been said above, particularly in the chapter on Faith:<p>"The Lord, charity and faith make one, like life, will and understanding in man; and if they are divided, each perishes like a pearl reduced to powder." (<a href="367.htm">367</a>[7]).<p>and from these words in the same chapter:<p>"The Lord is charity and faith in man, and man is charity and faith in the Lord." (<a href="368.htm">368</a>).<p>But it may be asked how a man can enter into that union. The answer is, that he cannot, unless he on his part removes his evils by repentance. It is said that man removes them, because the Lord does not directly bring about their removal without man's co-operation. This was fully shown in the same chapter, and in the following chapter on Free Will. </p>

522. Quod omne malum nisi removetur, apud hominem maneat, et quod homo si in suis malis manet, non possit salvari, ex se consequitur; quod non aliquod malum possit removeri nisi a Domino apud illos qui credunt in Ipsum, et amant proximum, ex anteactis evidenter constare potest; imprimis ex his in Capite de FIDE, Quod <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Dominus, Charitas et Fides unum faciant, sicut vita, voluntas et intellectus, et si dividuntur, unumquodvis pereat sicut Unio dilapsa in pollinem. Et <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
ex his ibi, Quod Dominus sit Charitas et Fides in homine, et quod homo sit Charitas et Fides in Domino. Sed quaeritur, quomodo homo in illam unionem intrare potest; respondetur, quod non possit, nisi mala sua quoad partem removeat per poenitentiam: dicitur, ut homo removeat, quia Dominus absque cooperatione hominis non immediate id facit; quod etiam in eodem Capite, et in sequente de LIBERO ARBITRIO, plene ostensum est.<p>
