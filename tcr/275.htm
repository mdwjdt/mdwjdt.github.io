<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>275</b>.自上古时代就已存在的宗教和世界各地的居民都知道神，对死后的生活也有所了解。这种知识并非来自他们自己或他们自己的聪明，而是来自古圣言（参看264－266节），后来则来自以色列人的圣言。基于这两本圣言的宗教信仰传播到印度群岛及其邻近岛屿，经埃及和埃塞俄比亚传至非洲国家，又从亚细亚沿岸传至希腊，从希腊传至意大利。不过，由于圣言只能通过代表来写，而代表就是诸如对应并表示天上事物的那类事物，故这些民族的宗教信仰就沦为偶像崇拜，在希腊则沦为神话传说。神的特征和属性变成众多神明，他们还在这些神明之上立了一位至高无上者，称其为朱庇特，或许这名源于耶和华。众所周知，他们知道乐园、大洪水、圣火和自第一或黄金时代到最后或铁器时代这四个时代（如但以理书所描述的<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.31.htm">2:31</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.35.htm">35</a>））。</p>

275. 自最遠古時期, 宗教就已存在, 世人各地的人們都知道上帝, 並知道死後生活的事情。這些知識絕非從他們自己而來, 或自行悟出, 而是來自古聖言(參看<a href="264.htm">264-266</a>節), 以及之後的以色列聖言。基於此二聖言的宗教概念散佈到印度群島及鄰近島嶼, 經埃及和埃塞俄比亞傳至非洲各國, 從亞細亞沿岸至希臘並延至義大利。
<p>因為聖言只能以高度象徵的文字書寫, 用世上之物來對應,因而代表天上之物, 宗教的概念就被各族百姓淪為偶像崇拜的思想。在希臘變為神話傳說, 並將上帝的屬性與特徵轉變成眾多神明, 在眾神明之上設置一位稱為朱庇特的至高神, 或許這名字源自耶和華(注:朱庇特Jove, 耶和華Jehovah)。
<p>眾所周知, 他們知道樂園,大洪水,祭火,從黃金到鐵器四個時代(參看<a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">但以理書2:31-35</a>)等概念。 </p>

275. Since the earliest times, religion has existed and the inhabitants of our planet have known about God and something about life after death. People did not receive this knowledge from themselves or their own intelligence; they received it from the ancient Word discussed above (264-266). Later on people received this knowledge from the Israelite Word. From these two Word's, religious concepts spread to the Indies and their islands; through Egypt and Ethiopia into the countries of Africa; and from the coastal regions of the Middle East into Greece and from there into Italy.
<p>Because that Word could be written only in language that was highly symbolic, using things in the world that correspond to and therefore stand for things in heaven, the nations eventually turned its religious concepts into idolatrous concepts - in Greece into myths - and turned divine attributes and characteristics into as many gods. Over these gods they placed a supreme god whom they called Jove, perhaps from Jehovah.
<p>It is generally known that they had a concept of paradise, a flood, sacred fire, and four ages - starting with the golden age and ending with the iron age, as recorded in <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>. </p>

275. Religion existed from the most ancient times, and the inhabitants of all parts of the world knew about God, and something about life after death. This knowledge did not come from them themselves or their own intelligence, but from the ancient Word (described above, 264-266), and later on from the Israelite Word. Religious beliefs based upon these two Words spread to the Indies and the adjacent islands, and by way of Egypt and Ethiopia to the kingdoms of Africa; and from the coasts of Asia to Greece and so to Italy. But because the Word had to be written by means of representatives, which are the sort of things in the world which correspond to heavenly things and so stand for them, the religious beliefs of the heathen turned to idolatry, and in Greece to fables. The attributes and qualities of God became so many gods, and they set over them the highest whom they called Jove, perhaps after Jehovah. It is well known that they knew about paradise, the flood, the sacred fire, and the four ages beginning with the golden and ending with the iron age (as in <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>). </p>

275. It was not from themselves nor from their own intelligence, but from the ancient Word (see above(<a href="264.htm">264-266</a>), and afterwards from the Israelitish Word, that from the most ancient times religion has existed, and the inhabitants of the earth everywhere have had a knowledge of God, and some knowledge of a life after death. From these two Words religious systems spread into the Indies and their islands; through Egypt and Ethiopia into the kingdoms of Africa; from the maritime parts of Asia into Greece, and from Greece into Italy. But as the Word could be written only by representations, which are such things in the world as correspond to and thus signify heavenly things, the religions of these nations were turned into idolatries, and in Greece into fables; and the Divine attributes and properties were turned into as many gods, over whom one was made supreme, whom they called Jove, possibly from Jehovah. It is known that they had a knowledge of Paradise, of the flood, of the sacred fire, and of the four ages, from the first or golden age, to the last or iron age (as described in <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>). </p>

275. Religion has existed from the most ancient times, and the inhabitants of the earth everywhere have had a knowledge of God, and some knowledge of a life after death. This has not originated from themselves or their own intelligence, but from the ancient Word, mentioned above in<a href="264.htm">264-266</a>; and in later times from the Israelitish Word. From these two Words forms of religion spread to the Indies and their islands; through Egypt and Ethiopia to the kingdoms of Africa, from the maritime parts of Asia to Greece, and thence to Italy. However, as the Word could only be written by representatives, that is, by such things in the world as correspond to, and consequently signify, heavenly things, religion with the Gentiles was turned into idolatry, and in Greece into mythology. Divine properties and attributes were turned into so many gods, and over these men set one supreme deity whom they called Jove, possibly from Jehovah; while it is well known that they had some conception of Paradise, some knowledge of the Flood, the sacred fire, and the four ages from the first or golden age to the last or iron age, as described in <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>. </p>

275. Quod ab antiquissimis temporibus fuerit Religio, et Incolae Orbis ubivis noverint de Deo, et aliquid de vita post mortem, non fuit ex ipsis, aut ex propria illorum intelligentia, sed ex Verbo Vetusto, de quo supra <a href="264.htm">264-266</a>, et postea ex Verbo Israelitico: ex duobus Verbis his Religiosa emanaverunt in Indias et illarum Insulas, perque Aegyptum ac Aethiopiam in Regna Africae, et ex Maritimis Asiae in Graeciam, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et inde in Italiam: sed quia Verbum non potuit aliter quam per Repraesentativa esse conscriptum, quae sunt talia in Mundo quae correspondent Coelestibus, et inde significant illa, ideo Religiosa Gentium versa sunt in Idololatrica, et in Graecia in Fabulosa, ac Attributa et Praedicata Divina in totidem Deos, quibus praefecerunt Supremum, quem vocaverunt Jovem, forte a Jehovah; quod illis cognitio fuerit de Paradiso, de Diluvio, de Igne sacro, de quatuor Aetatibus, a Prima aurea ad Ultimam ferream, ut apud <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Danielem 2:31-35</a>, notum est.<p>
