<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第353节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>353</b>.前面说过，在天堂，一切真理都放出光芒，因此就其本质而言，信其实就是发光的真理（348，349节）。随着这信之真理增多，它们的光芒所赋予信的美丽和魅力好比由各种和谐组合的不同颜色所形成的各种形状、物体和绘画；还好比亚伦胸牌上不同颜色的宝石，它们合称乌陵和土明；同样好比将要建造的新耶路撒冷城墙根基的各样宝石（如启示录第21章所描述的）；或好比王冠上各样颜色的宝石。此外，各种宝石表信之真理。它又好比彩虹、花海的美丽，或早春花园盛开的美丽。<br />信因形成其结构的大量真理而显出的光辉灿烂，好比教堂中大量灯台的灯火通明，或家中吊灯和街上路灯的灯光。信通过大量真理的上升好比伴随着众多乐器共同演奏而来的音声和旋律的增多；还好比芬芳的花朵组合在一起时所产生的浓郁香味，诸如此类。信通过大量真理所形成的抵制假与恶的力量好比教堂因砌得好的石头和支撑墙壁、天花板的柱子而具有的坚固性；它还好比排列成方阵的军队，士兵在方阵中并肩站立，从而形成一股力，行如一体；它又好比交织构成整副躯体的肌肉，尽管它们如此众多，又如此分散，但在行动中仍构成一股力量等等。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #353 </h4>
<p>
353. 在之前曾敘述過, 在天國中一切真理都發光, 因此信的本質其實就是發光的真理(第<a href="348.htm">348-349</a>節)。當此信的真理增多時, 所發之光令這樣的信美麗動人, 好比不同顏色形成的形狀,物體和圖畫和諧地並置。還好比亞倫的胸牌上不同顏色的寶石, 合在一起稱之為烏明和土陵; 又好比新耶路撒冷城牆根基的各樣寶石(啟示錄 21章)。或者, 就像皇冠上各樣顏色的寶石。實際上, 寶石意思指構成信的真理。人們還可用彩虹的美麗, 或早春開滿鮮花的田地或園子來作打比方。
<p> 從真理聚集形成的結構而來的信, 所顯出的光亮與榮耀, 好比教堂中點亮大量蠟燭的光亮, 好比家中點亮許多燈,街上點亮許多路燈。
<p>藉著真理的增加來提升信到一個更高的層次, 好比各樣樂器一同和諧演奏時音量的提高與音效的增強; 又好比將許多芬芳的花朵放在一起時香味的增加; 等等。
<p>信抵制偽與惡的能力源自于形成信的大量真理, 就好比教堂的堅固來自于巧妙的石匠技術,支撐牆壁和屋頂的圓柱; 也好比按方陣排列的軍隊, 士兵肩並肩站立, 擰成一股力量行動; 這樣的能力還好比人全身的肌肉:儘管它們如此多,並且分佈廣泛, 在行動時卻發揮出單一的力量; 等等。 </p>

353. Just above I made the statement that every truth shines in heaven, and as a result, faith in its essence is truth shining [348, 349]. When the truths of this faith are multiplied, their shining light gives faith a beauty and attractiveness like that of forms, objects, and works of art whose colors harmonize well. It is like the precious stones of different colors on Aaron's breastplate that were collectively called the Urim and Thummim. It is also like the precious stones that the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem were made of (Revelation 21); and also like precious stones of different colors in a royal crown. In fact, precious stones mean the truths that constitute faith. One could also draw a comparison with the beauty of a rainbow, and with the beauty of a field full of flowers or a garden in bloom during early spring.
<p>Faith that is composed of a quantity of truths takes on a light and a glory that are like the lighting of church buildings with more and more candles, of homes with more and more lamps, and of streets with more and more streetlamps.
<p>The elevation of faith through a quantity of truths can be compared to the increase in volume and the heightened musical effect that occurs when many instruments play together; also, the increase in fragrance that comes from putting together a whole garland of sweet-smelling flowers; and so on.
<p>The power that faith acquires from a plurality of truths assembled to combat things that are false and evil can be compared to the solidity that a church building gains from well-crafted stonework and from columns that buttress its walls and support its vaulted ceilings. That power can also be compared to a squadron in a square formation in which the soldiers stand side to side and thus form, and move as, a single force. That power can also be compared to the muscles all over our body: although there are many of them and some are far apart, they still make one power in our actions; and so on. </p>

353. I said above that every truth shines in heaven, and consequently truth when shining is faith in essence. The beauty and charm faith gets from this illumination, as the truths in it increase in number, can be compared with various shapes, objects and pictures, formed by different colours harmoniously juxtaposed; also with the precious stones of different colours in Aaron's breastplate, which were collectively called Urim and Thummim. Likewise they can be compared with the precious stones of which the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem were to be built (as described in Revelation chapter 21); or with the precious stones of different colours in a king's crown. Moreover, precious stones mean the truths of faith. Comparison is also possible with the beauty of the rainbow, or of a meadow full of flowers, and of a garden in bloom in early springtime.</p>
<p>
[2] The light and glorious appearance of faith, which it gets from the volume of truths which form its structure, can be compared with the lighting of churches by a great number of lamp-stands, of houses by lamps and of streets by lanterns. The raising of faith to a higher level by the volume of truths can be illustrated by comparison with the increase in the volume of sound and the accompanying melody produced by playing a number of musical instruments in harmony; and also with the increase in fragrance produced by the grouping together of sweet-smelling flowers, and so on.<p>The resistance to falsities and evils of a faith formed from a large number of truths can be compared with the strength of a church built of well-fitted masonry, with columns to buttress the walls and support the ceiling. It can also be compared with troops drawn up to make a square formation, standing shoulder to shoulder and thus making up and acting as a single strongpoint. It can also be compared with the muscles which form the structure of the whole body, and, although they are so numerous and widely dispersed, none the less in action exert a single force; and so on and so forth. </p>

353. It has been said above, that in heaven every truth gives forth light, and therefore that faith in its essence is truth giving forth light; consequently the beauty and comeliness of faith caused by that glow, when truths of faith are multiplied, may be compared to various forms, objects, and pictures, formed by different colors harmoniously combined; also to the precious stones of various colors in the breastplate of Aaron, which together were called the Urim and Thummim; in like manner to the precious stones of which the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem are to be built (see Revelation 21). It may also be compared to the precious stones of many colors in a king's crown. Indeed, precious stones signify truths of faith. It may also be compared to the beauty of the rainbow, of a field of flowers, or of a blooming garden in early spring. The light and glory of faith from an abundance of concordant truths fitly arranged in it, may be compared to the illumination of churches by numerous candelabra, or of houses by chandeliers, or of streets by lamps. The exaltation of faith by an abundance of truths, may be illustrated by comparison with the increase of sound and also of melody, arising from many musical instruments played in concert; and with the increase of fragrance arising from a collection of sweetly-exhaling flowers; and so on. The power of a faith formed from a multiplicity of truths, as opposed to falsities and evils, may be compared to the firmness of a church built of stones properly laid, with columns built into its walls, and under its fretted ceiling; it may also be compared to a battalion formed in square, where the soldiers stand side by side, and thus form and act as one force; it may also be compared to the muscles of which the whole body is interwoven, which although so numerous and so differently located, still in action constitute one power; and so on. </p>

353. It was stated above that every truth in heaven shines as light, and thus that truth so shining is faith in essence. Therefore faith, in the beauty and charm that arise from that light, especially when the truths which compose it increase in number, may be compared to manifold forms, objects and pictures composed of various colors harmoniously blended. Thus it may be compared to the precious stones of various colors in Aaron's breastplate, which were called by the two names Urim and Thummim; and likewise to the precious stones of which the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem must be built, as described in the Revelation, chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>. It may also be compared to the precious stones of various colors in a king's crown. Precious stones also signify truths of faith. Such a faith may also be compared to the beauty of a rainbow, of a flowery meadow, and of a garden in the first bloom of spring.<p>The light and glory of faith that is composed of many harmonious truths may be compared to the illumination of temples by numerous candlesticks, of houses by chandeliers, and of streets by lamps. The exaltation of faith by truths in great numbers may be compared to the heightened effect in volume and melody produced by increasing the number of musical instruments in an orchestra; and to the increase of fragrance from a mass of sweet-smelling flowers; and so on. The power of a faith composed of many truths set in array against falsity and evil, may be compared to the stability of a temple, built of stones well cemented together, with buttress columns strengthening its walls and supporting its paneled roof. It may also be compared to an army formed into a square, where the soldiers stand side by side, thus combining their strength for united action; and finally it may be compared to the muscles by which the whole body is interwoven which, notwithstanding their number and situation in places far apart, concentrate their united power, and thus act with greater effect. </p>

353. Supra dictum est, quod omnis veritas in Coelo luceat, et inde quod veritas lucens sit fides in essentia; quare fidei pulchritudo et decor ex illustratione illa, dum veritates ejus multiplicantur, comparari potest cum variis formis, objectis et picturis, formatis ex diversis coloribus coaptatis secundum convenientias; proinde cum lapidibus pretiosis diversicoloribus in Pectorali Aharonis, qui simul Urim et Thumim <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
vocati sunt; pariter cum lapidibus pretiosis, ex quibus fundamenta muri novae Hierosolymae construenda sunt, de quibus in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Apocalypsi 21</a>; comparari etiam potest cum lapidibus pretiosis diversicoloribus in Corona Regis; lapides pretiosi etiam significant veritates fidei. Comparatio etiam fieri potest cum pulchritudine iridis, cumque pulchritudine campi floriferi, et quoque horti efflorescentis, tempore primi veris.</p>
<p>
[2] Lux et gloria fidei ex copia veritatum concinnantium illam, comparari potest cum illustratione Templorum ex multiplicatis candelabris, domuum ex lychnaribus, ac platearum ex lampadibus. Fidei exaltatio per copiam veritatum illustrari potest per comparationem cum exaltatione clangoris et simul melo ex pluribus instrumentis musicis in concentu; et quoque cum exaltatione fragrantiae ex consertione florum dulce halantium, et sic porro. Potentia fidei ex pluralitate veritatum conformatae contra falsa et mala, comparari potest cum firmitate Templi ex lapidibus disposite connexis, et ex columnis muro ejus adstructis, et laqueari ejus substructis; comparari etiam potest cum agmine quadrato, in quo milites conserunt latera lateribus, et sic unum robur formant et agunt; comparari etiam potest cum musculis, ex quibus totum corpus est circumtextum, qui tametsi numerosi et dissiti sunt, usque unam potentiam in actionibus faciunt, et sic amplius.<p>
