<p>
738. After that, the angel guide returned to the first building, to the people who had firmly convinced themselves that heavenly joy and eternal happiness consisted in perpetually glorifying God in a celebration that would go on forever. In the world, they had believed that they were going to see God and that the reason people referred to the life of heaven as "a perpetual Sabbath" was that it consisted entirely in worshiping God.
<p>To this group the angel said, "Follow me and I will bring you into your joy. "
<p>He led them to a small town with a church building in the middle of it. All the houses there were referred to as sacred buildings. In that town the group saw crowds of people coming in from the territory surrounding it on every side. In among the crowd there were a number of priests, greeting and welcoming people and leading them by the hand to the gateways of the church, and through them to several of the buildings surrounding the church; they introduced the people to the everlasting worship of God.
<p>"This town is a point of entry to heaven," the priests said. "The church building here is an entrance to a magnificent, enormous church that is in heaven. The angels glorify God there with prayers and praises forever. It is a rule both here and there that you first have to come into this church building and spend three days and nights here. After this period of initiation, you will walk around to the other houses in this town, all of which we consider to be sacred; you will go from one building to the next. Along with the rest of the congregations there, you will pray, shout, and have sermons read to you. Take great care that you do not think anything within yourselves, or say anything to anyone else, that is not holy, devout, and religious. "
</p>
<p>
[2] Then the angel led his group to the church building. It was packed beyond capacity. There were many people there who had been of high rank and position in the world, and also many who had been ordinary people. There were groups of guards posted at each entrance to the church to prevent anyone from leaving before the three days had passed.
<p>"Today is the second day since these people came in," said the angel. Look at them carefully and you will see how they are glorifying God. "
<p>The angel's group looked around. They saw that many of the worshipers were fast asleep. The people who were still awake were yawning and yawning. Because they were constantly lifting their thoughts toward God and never allowing those thoughts to come back down into their bodies, some of them had the feeling that they were faces disconnected from their bodies, and that was also how they appeared from the outside. Some of them, whose eyes were rolled back into their heads as a result of looking upward all the time, looked insane. Briefly put, the hearts of all were depressed and their spirits were fatigued with boredom. They turned away from the pulpit and began shouting, "Our ears are going deaf. Stop preaching! We're not listening to you any more - the sound of your voice is making us sick. "
<p>They stood up and rushed en masse toward the doors, broke them open, pushed up against the guards, and shoved them out of the way.
</p>
<p>
[3] The priests pursued them and clung on to them, teaching and teaching, praying and sighing. They were saying, "Celebrate the festival! Glorify God! Sanctify yourselves! This is a point of entry to heaven where we will be inaugurating you into the everlasting glorification of God that takes place in the magnificent, enormous church that is in heaven - this is your initiation into the enjoyment of eternal happiness!"
<p>The worshipers did not understand these statements, though, and barely even heard them, because their minds had been dulled by this two-day suspension from their usual activity at home and at work.
<p>When they tried to tear themselves away from the priests, however, the priests grabbed them by the arms or the clothes, pulling them toward the buildings where the sermons were being read, but without success. The people shouted, "Leave us alone! We are about to lose consciousness altogether. "
</p>
<p>
[4] At that moment four men appeared, dressed in shining white, with caps on their heads. One of them had been an archbishop in the world; the other three had been bishops; they had since become angels. They called the priests together. After greeting them, they said, "We have been watching from heaven how you interact with these sheep. You have been feeding and feeding them to the point where they are having a mental breakdown. You evidently don't know what it means to glorify God. It means bearing the fruits of love - that is, performing our work faithfully, honestly, and diligently. Doing this is loving God; doing this is also loving our neighbor. It is the glue that holds society together, and it is what is best for the community. God is glorified by our doing this, and then also by our having worship at particular times. Have you not read what the Lord said? 'My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit; and you will become my disciples' (<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>).
</p>
<p>
[5] "Because it is your job, it is possible for you priests to keep going in a worship service of glorification. It brings you honor, glory, and financial reward. But if this were not your job, and you did not get honor, glory, and money from it, you would not be able to keep glorifying indefinitely any more than these people were able to. "
<p>The bishops then commanded the guards to open the doors and let everyone come in or go out as he or she wished, since there is a great multitude of people, ignorant of the true nature of heaven, who cannot conceive of heavenly joy in any other form than perpetual worship of God. </p>

<p>
738. After this the angel guide came back to the building to address those who had formed a strong conviction that heavenly joy and everlasting happiness were a perpetual glorification of God, and a festival lasting for ever. This was because in the world they had believed that then they would see God, and because life in heaven as the result of worshipping God is called 'a perpetual Sabbath'.<p>'Follow me,' the angel told them, 'and I shall take you where you can experience your idea of joy.' He took them into a small town, in the middle of which there was a church, and all the houses were called sacred buildings. They saw in the town crowds coming from every corner of the surrounding country, and amongst them a number of priests. These received and greeted the new arrivals, and taking them by the hand brought them to the doors of the church, and from there to some buildings around it, and introduced them to the constant worship of God. They told them that this town was a forecourt leading to heaven, and its church was the entrance to a magnificent, vast church in heaven, where the angels glorify God with prayers and praises for ever. 'The rules here and also there,' they said, 'are that people must first enter the church and spend three days and three nights there. After this initiation they must go into the houses of the town, which are all sacred buildings dedicated by us; and then moving from one to another, they must join the congregations there in prayer, shouts of praise and the repetition of sermons. But above all you must be careful not to think to yourselves or say to companions anything but what is holy, pious and religious.'</p>
<p>
[2] After this the angel took his party into the church, which was packed full with many who had held high rank in the world as well as many ordinary people. There were guards at the doors to prevent anyone leaving before spending his three days there. 'Today,' said the angel, 'is the second day since these people came in; look carefully at them, and you will see how they glorify God.'<p>When they looked, they saw that most were asleep, and those who were awake could not stop yawning. As the result of constantly keeping their thoughts raised to God, and never allowing them to drop back to the body, some appeared to themselves and so also to others as if they were faces shut off from the body. Some were wild-eyed from constantly withdrawing their eyes. In short, all were depressed at heart and weary in spirit from boredom. They turned their backs on the pulpit and shouted: 'Our ears are stunned, put an end to your sermons; we cannot hear your voice any longer and the sound of it is beginning to become hateful.' Then they got up, rushed in a body to the doors, broke them open and by pressure on the guards drove them out of the way.</p>
<p>
[3] On seeing this the priests followed them and coming close beside them kept teaching them amid prayers and sighs. 'Keep the festival,' they said, 'glorify God, sanctify yourselves. In this forecourt to heaven we shall initiate you into the everlasting glorification of God in the magnificent, vast church which is in heaven, and so you will enjoy everlasting happiness.' But they were unable to grasp this and hardly heard it, because two days of keeping their thoughts raised and removed from domestic and everyday matters had dulled their minds. But when they tried to snatch themselves away, the priests caught hold of their arms and their clothes too, pressing them to enter the buildings where sermons were being delivered. All to no avail; the people cried, 'Leave us alone; we feel in our bodies as if we are fainting.'</p>
<p>
[4] As soon as this was said, four men were seen, dressed in white robes and mitres. One of them had been an archbishop in the world and the other three had been bishops; all had now become angels. They called the priests together to address them. 'We have seen you,' they said, 'from heaven with this flock of yours, and what sort of pastors you are. You are driving them mad. You do not know what glorifying God means; it means bringing forth the fruits of love, that is, faithfully, honestly and painstakingly doing the work demanded by one's occupation. For this is a part of loving God and loving the neighbour; it is the bond which holds a community together, and it is the good it performs. By this God is glorified, as well as by worship at fixed times. Have you not read the Lord's words:<p>In this is my Father glorified, by your bringing forth much fruit and becoming my disciples, <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] You priests can devote yourselves to worship and glorification, because this is your duty, and it brings you honour, glory and reward. Still you could no more than they devote yourselves to that glorification, if honour, glory and reward did not attend upon your duty.'<p>With these words the bishops ordered the guards on the doors to allow everyone to enter or leave. 'For,' they said, 'there is a vast number of people who are unable to imagine any joy in heaven other than constantly worshipping God, because they knew nothing about conditions in heaven.' </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #738 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
738. After this the angelic leader returned to the hall, to those who had firmly persuaded themselves that heavenly joy and eternal happiness are a perpetual glorification of God and an endless festival; and this, because they had believed when in the world that after death they would see God, and because the life of heaven on account of the worship of God there, is called a perpetual sabbath. <p>To these the angel said, "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joy." And he led them into a small city. In the center of it there was a temple, and all the houses were called sacred chapels. In this city they saw a gathering of people from every quarter of the surrounding country, and among them a number of priests who received the visitors, saluted them, and taking them by the hand led them to the gates of the temple, and then to some chapels round about the temple, and initiated them into the endless worship of God; saying, "This city is the vestibule of heaven, and the temple of this city is the entrance to a grand and spacious temple in heaven, where God is glorified by angels with praises and prayers forever. It is ordered both here and there that newcomers shall first enter the temple and remain there three days and three nights, and after this initiation shall enter into the houses of this city (which are so many chapels consecrated by us), and shall go from chapel to chapel, and in communion with those assembled there shall pray, and shout, and repeat what has been preached. Be very careful to think of nothing by yourselves and to speak of nothing with your companions, except what is holy, and pious, and religious."
</p>
<p>
[2] After this the angel led his company into the temple, which was full, and was crowded with many who had enjoyed great dignity in the world, and also with many common people. At the gates of the temple guards were placed to prevent anyone from going out until he had been there three days. And the angel said, "This is the second day since these people came in; watch them, and you will see how they glorify God." <p>And looking at them they saw most of them asleep, and those who were awake continually yawning; and some of them, in consequence of the continued elevation of their thoughts to God without any return whatever to the body, seemed like faces separated from their bodies (for so they appeared to themselves, and therefore to others); and the eyes of some looked wild from their being continually turned upward. In a word, the breasts of all were oppressed, and their spirits were weary with the tediousness; and they turned away from the pulpit and cried out, "Our ears are stunned, stop your preaching; we no longer hear a word; the very sound begins to be more than we can bear." And then they rose up and rushed in a mass to the gates, broke them open, overpowered the guards and drove them away.
</p>
<p>
[3] Seeing this the priests followed, keeping close to them, teaching and teaching, praying and sighing, and saying, "Celebrate the festival, glorify God, sanctify yourselves; in this vestibule of heaven we will inaugurate you into an eternal glorification of God in the grand and spacious temple that is in heaven, and thus lead you into the enjoyment of eternal happiness." But the crowd did not understand these words, and scarcely heard them because of the dullness of their minds from a two days' suspension and detention from domestic and outdoor affairs. But when they attempted to tear themselves away from the priests, the priests caught them by the arms, and also by their clothing, urging them to the chapels to hear their sermons; but in vain. They cried out, "Let us go; we feel as if we should faint."
</p>
<p>
[4] At these words four men in white garments and with miters appeared. One of them when in the world had been an archbishop, and the other three had been bishops; they had now become angels. These called the priests together, and addressing them, said, "We saw you from heaven with these sheep, and saw how you are feeding them. You are feeding them even to madness. You do not know what glorifying God means. It means to bring forth the fruits of love, that is, to discharge faithfully, sincerely, and diligently the work of one's calling; for this is from love to God and love to the neighbor, and is the bond of society and the good of society. It is in this way that God is glorified, and then by worship at stated times. Have you not read these words of the Lord? <p>Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and ye shall become My disciples (<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>).
</p>
<p>
[5] You priests may be in the glorifying of God by means of worship, because it is your office, and from it you have honor, glory, and remuneration; but you could no more continue in it than these people if honor, glory, and remuneration were not connected with your office." <p>So saying the bishops ordered the guards at the gate to let all pass out and to admit all, "for," they said, "there are a great many who can conceive of no other heavenly joy than the unceasing worship of God, because they have been wholly ignorant of what the heavenly state is." </p>

<p>
738. The conducting angel afterwards returned to the house to those who had firmly persuaded themselves that heavenly joy and eternal happiness consisted in the perpetual glorification of God and a religious festival continuing to eternity. This was because they had believed in the world that they should then see God, and because the life of heaven, from the worship of God, is called a perpetual sabbath. The angel said to them, "Follow me, and I will introduce you to your joy."<p>He led them into a small city in the midst of which was a temple, and where all the houses were called sacred chapels. In this city they saw a great concourse of people flocking in from every quarter of the neighboring country. Among them they saw a number of priests, who received them as they came in with words of greeting, and taking them by the hand, led them to the gates of the temple; then to some of the adjacent sacred houses, and initiated them into the perpetual worship of God. They said that this city was one of the courts leading to heaven, and that its temple was introductory to a magnificent and most spacious temple in heaven, where the angels glorified God with prayers and praises to eternity. It was ordained both there and in heaven, that they should first enter the temple, and remain there for three days and nights. After this initiation they should go into the houses of this city, which were so many sacred chapels consecrated by them; and going from house to house, in communion with those already assembled there, they should pray, cry aloud, and take part in the public celebrations. "But be very careful," they added, "to think nothing but what is holy, pious and religious."</p>
<p>
[2] After this the angel led his company into the temple, which was full, being crowded with many who had held high rank in the world, as well as with many of the common people; and guards were stationed at the gates to prevent anyone leaving before completing a period of three days. The angel said: "To-day is the second day since this party entered; observe them, and you will see their manner of glorifying God." So they looked at them and saw that most of them were asleep, and that those who were awake were continually yawning. Some from the constant elevation of their thoughts to God, with no thought for the body, seemed like faces shut off from their body; for so they seemed to themselves, and, therefore, to others; while the eyes of others appeared wandering, from their constant pre-occupation with abstractions. In a word all were oppressed in heart and weary beyond measure in spirit; so they turned away from the pulpit, calling out, "Our ears are stupefied; cease your sermonizing; we no longer hear your voice, and we cannot bear the sound of it." They then rose up, and in a body rushed to the gates, broke them open, overcame the guards and drove them away.</p>
<p>
[3] On seeing this the priests followed them, and walking close beside them, kept on teaching, praying, sighing and saying, "Celebrate the festival, glorify God, and sanctify yourselves. In this court of heaven we will initiate you into the eternal glorification of God as it is celebrated in that magnificent and most spacious temple in heaven, and so we will initiate you into the enjoyment of eternal happiness." These words, however, were not understood by them, and indeed they were scarcely heard because of the torpor induced by two days' mental inactivity and abstention from domestic and public duties. When they attempted to disengage themselves from the priests, these caught hold of their arms and their garments, urging them to go into the sacred chapels and take part in the general celebrations, but all in vain. "Leave us," they cried, "we feel as if we should faint."</p>
<p>
[4] At these words four men appeared in white garments, and wearing mitres; in the world one of them had been an archbishop and the other three bishops, and all were now angels. They called the priests together and, addressing them, said: "We have observed you from heaven with these sheep; and we have seen how you fed them: you feed them till you drive them to distraction. You do not understand what is meant by the glorification of God. It means to bring forth the fruits of love, that is, to discharge the duties of ones calling with fidelity, sincerity and diligence. For this is a mark of the love of God and of the love of the neighbor, which constitutes the bond of society and its good. Herein is God glorified, as well as by worship at stated times. Have you not read these words of the Lord:<p>"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples" <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] You priests may continue to practice glorification as part of your worship, because it is your office, and from it you derive honor, glory and recompense. Nevertheless, you would not continue in so doing any more than they unless your office brought you honor, glory and recompense." Having said this the bishops commanded the door-keepers to let all pass freely in as well as out, "For," they said, "there are many who can only think of heavenly joy as the perpetual worship of God, because they know nothing of the heavenly state." </p>

Post haec Angelus ductor rediit in Aedem, ad illos, qui firmiter sibi persuaserant, quod Gaudium coeleste et Felicitas aeterna sit perpetua Glorificatio Dei, ac in aeternum perennans Festum; ex causa, quia in Mundo crediderant, quod tunc visuri sint Deum, et quia vita Coeli ex cultu Dei vocatur perpetuum Sabbathum.

[2] Post haec introduxit Angelus comitatum suum in Templum, quod erat plenum et constipatum multis, qui in magna dignitate in Mundo fuerant, et quoque multis ex plebe, et praesidia ad portas collocata erant, ne cuiquam ante commorationem trium dierum liceret exire; et dixit Angelus, est hodie secundus dies, a quo hi ingressi sunt; lustrate illos, et glorificationem Dei illorum videbitis; et lustrabant, et viderunt plerosque dormientes, et qui evigilati sunt, oscitantes et oscitantes, et quosdam ex continua elevatione cogitationum ad Deum, et ex nullo relapsu illarum in corpus, sicut facies reclusas a corpore, ita enim sibi apparebant, et inde etiam aliis; quosdam deliros oculis ex perpetua subtractione illorum; verbo, omnes compressos pectore, et lassos spiritu ex taedio, et aversos a pulpito, et clamantes, stupescunt aures nostrae; finite conciones; non auditur amplius vox, et incipit fastidiri sonus: et tunc surrexerunt, et in globo concurrerunt ad portas, effregerunt illas, et urgebant in praesidia, et abigebant illa.</p>
<p>
[3] His visis, Sacerdotes sequuti sunt illos, et adjunxerunt se lateribus illorum, docentes et docentes, orantes, suspirantes, dicentes, celebrate Festum, glorificate Deum, sanctificate vos; in atrio hoc Coeli inaugurabimus vos in aeternam Glorificationem Dei in magnifico et amplissimo Templo, quod in Coelo est, et sic ad fruitionem aeternae felicitatis. Sed haec ab illis non intellecta, et vix audita sunt, propter hebetudinem ex duorum dierum suspensione mentis, et retentione a domesticis et forensibus. Sed cum se a Sacerdotibus avellere conati sunt, sacerdotes apprehendebant brachia illorum, et quoque vestes, urgentes ad aedes, ubi concionata recitarentur, sed frustra, et, clamabant, relinquite nos, sentimus in corpore sicut deliquium.</p>
<p>
[4] His dictis, ecce visi sunt quatuor Viri in candidis vestibus, et in tiaris; unus ex illis fuerat in Mundo Archi Episcopus, et tres reliqui fuerant Episcopi, nunc facti Angeli: hi convocabant Sacerdotes, et alloquuti illos dixerunt, vidimus vos e Coelo cum ovibus his, quomodo vos pascitis illos; pascitis illos usque ad insanias; nescitis quid per Glorificationem Dei intelligitur; intelligitur fructus amoris ferre, hoc est, fideliter, sincere, et sedule suae functionis opus facere, hoc enim est amoris Dei, et amoris proximi, et hoc est vinculum Societatis, et bonum ejus; per hoc glorificatur Deus, et tunc per cultum statis temporibus; annon legistis haec Domini verba, In hoc GLORIFICATUR PATER MEUS, ut fructum multum feratis, et reddamini discipuli mei, <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">Johannes 15:8</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] Vos Sacerdotes potestis in cultus glorificatione esse, quia hoc est vestrum munus, et inde est vobis honor, gloria et remuneratio, sed usque vos non potestis plus quam illi in ea glorificatione esse, nisi honor, gloria, et remuneratio una cum vestro munere sint. His dictis Episcopi mandabant custodibus portae, ut intromitterent omnes, et emitterent omnes, est enim multitudo, qui non aliud gaudium Coeleste, quam perpetuum cultum Dei, potuerunt cogitare, quia non sciverunt aliquid de statu Coeli.<p>
