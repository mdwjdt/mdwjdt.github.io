606. From the above we can conclude that when we have not been regenerated, we see ghosts at night, so to speak, and think they are real people. When we are being regenerated, we become aware first thing in the morning that what was seen in the night was unreal. When we have been regenerated and are in broad daylight, we realize that our visions in the night were a form of madness.
<p>People who have not been regenerated are dreaming; people who have been regenerated are awake. In fact, in the Word our earthly life is compared to a sleep and our spiritual life to wakefulness.
<p>People who have not been regenerated are meant by the foolish young women who had lamps but no oil. People who have been regenerated are meant by the prudent young women who had lamps and also oil [<a href="3927/matthew_25_4.htm">Matthew 25:4</a>]. The lamps mean things that belong to our intellect; the oil means things that belong to our love.
<p>People who have been regenerated are like the oil lamps on the lampstand in the tabernacle. They are also like the showbread and the incense on the table and the altar there. They are the people in <a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a> who are as radiant as the brightness of the firmament and who shine like the stars for an age and forever.
</p>
<p>
[2] People who have not been regenerated are in the Garden of Eden, so to speak, but they eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and are thrown out of the garden; in fact they are that tree. People who have been regenerated are also in that garden but they eat from the tree of life. The Book of Revelation makes clear that it is possible to eat from the tree of life: "To those who overcome I will give [food] to eat from the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>). The Garden of Eden means a spiritual understanding that arises from a love for truth; see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_90.htm">Revelation Unveiled 90</a>.
<p>Briefly put, someone who has not been regenerated is a child of the evil one; someone who has been regenerated is a child of the kingdom (<a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>). A child of the evil one in this passage means a child of the Devil, and a child of the kingdom means a child of the Lord. </p>

606. These facts allow us to reach the conclusion that a person who is not regenerated is like someone who seeing phantoms by night thinks they are people. Then when he is being regenerated he is like someone who sees at daybreak that what he saw in the night was a delusion, and later, when he has been regenerated and is in full daylight, he sees that they were hallucinations. The person who has not been regenerated is like a dreamer; one who has, is like someone wide awake. In the Word too natural life is likened to sleep, spiritual life to wakefulness. It is the unregenerate person who is meant by the foolish virgins who had lamps, but no oil. The regenerated person is meant by the wise virgins who had lamps and also oil. Lamps mean things to do with the understanding, oil things to do with love. Regenerated persons are like the lights of the lampstand in the Tabernacle; and like the bread of the Presence and the incense placed on it there. These are the people who 'will shine like the radiance of the firmament, and be bright as stars for an age and for ever', as described in Daniel (<a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] The person who is not regenerated is like someone in the Garden of Eden who eats of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and is therefore expelled from the garden; in fact he is that very tree. But a regenerated person is like someone in that garden who eats of the tree of life. These words in Revelation establish that it is permissible to eat of that tree.<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God, <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>The Garden of Eden means intelligence in spiritual matters arising from the love of truth; see Apocalypse Revealed 90. In short, the unregenerate is the 'son of the evil one', and the regenerate is the 'son of the kingdom' (<a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>). 'Son of the evil one' there is the son of the devil, 'son of the kingdom' the son of the Lord, </p>

606. From all this it may be concluded that an unregenerate man is like one who sees phantoms at night, and believes them to be men; and afterwards, when he is being regenerated, he is like the same man seeing in the early dawn that the things he saw at night are delusions, and still later, when he is regenerated and is in the light of day, seeing them to be the offspring of delirium. An unregenerate man is like one dreaming, and a regenerate man like one awake; and in the Word natural life is likened to sleep, and spiritual life to a state of wakefulness. The unregenerate man is meant by the foolish virgins who had lamps but no oil, and the regenerate man by the wise virgins who had both lamps and oil, "lamps" meaning such things as pertain to the understanding, and "oil" such things as pertain to love. The regenerate are like the lamps of the lampstand in the tabernacle; they are like the bread of faces there with the frankincense upon it; and they are those who shall "shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars for ever and ever" (as said in <a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>). The unregenerate man is like one who is in the garden of Eden, and who eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and is therefore banished from the garden; he is indeed that very tree. But the regenerate man is like one who is in that garden and eats of the tree of life. That it is given to such to eat of it, is obvious from the following in Revelation: <p>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>), <p>"the garden of Eden" meaning intelligence in spiritual things, arising from love of truth (seeApocalypse Revealed,<a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_90.htm">90</a>). In a word, the unregenerate man is a "son of the evil one," and the regenerate a "son of the kingdom" (<a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>); "the son of the evil one" there meaning a child of the devil, and "the son of the kingdom" a child of the Lord. </p>

Afterwards while becoming regenerate, he is like the same person who sees at dawn that his night visions were delusions; and at length when he is regenerated, he sees by the light of day that they were the offspring of delirium.

606. Ex his concludi possunt haec, quod homo non regeneratus sit sicut qui videt phasmata in nocte, et credit esse homines, et deinde cum regeneratur sicut idem qui illa quae vidit in nocte, in primo mane videt quod fuerint ludibria, et postea dum regeneratus est, et in die est, ut deliria. Homo non regeneratus est sicut qui somniat, et homo regeneratus est, sicut qui vigilat; in Verbo etiam vita naturalis assimilatur somno, et vita spiritualis vigiliae. Homo non regeneratus intelligitur per Virgines stultas, quae habebant lampades, et non oleum, et regeneratus per Virgines prudentes quae habebant lampades et simul oleum; per lampades intelliguntur talia quae intellectus sunt, et per oleum quae amoris sunt. Regenerati sunt sicut Lucernae candelabri in Tabernaculo; suntque sicut Panes facierum cum thure super illis ibi: et sunt qui splendebunt sicut splendor expansi, et lucebunt sicut stellae in saeculum et aeternitatem, apud <a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Danielem 12:3</a>.</p>

[2] Homo non regeneratus est sicut qui in horto Edenis est, ac edit ex Arbore scientiae boni et mali, et propterea ex horto ejectus, imo est ipsa illa Arbor; at homo regeneratus est sicut qui in horto illo est, ac edit ex Arbore vitae; quod <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>

per hortum Edenis intelligitur intelligentia in spiritualibus ex Amore veri, videatur <a href="3927/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_90.htm">APOCALYPSIS REVELATA 90</a>. Verbo, non regeneratus est Filius mali, et regeneratus est Filius Regni, <a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthaeus 13:38</a>, filius mali ibi est filius diaboli, et filius Regni ibi est Filius Domini.<p>
