531. This change can be illustrated by the following comparison. Before repentance, we are like a desert, inhabited by terrifying wild creatures, dragons, eagle-owls, screech owls, vipers, and bloodletting snakes; in the clumps of bushes in that desert there are the owls and wild beasts of the desert [mentioned in the Bible], and satyrs are dancing [<a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>]. After these creatures have been expelled by human work and effort, however, that desert can be plowed and cultivated into fields, and these can be planted with oats, beans, and flax, and later on with barley and wheat.
<p>This can also be compared to the wickedness that is abundant and dominant in humankind. If evildoers were not chastised and punished with whippings and death, no city would survive; no nation would last. In effect, each one of us is society itself in its smallest form. If we do not treat ourselves in a spiritual way as evildoers are treated by the larger society in an earthly way, we are going to be chastised and punished after death; and this will continue until out of sheer fear of further punishment we stop doing evil, even if we can never be compelled to do what is good out of love for it. </p>

531. The following comparisons may serve to illustrate this. Before repentance a person is like a desert which is the home of terrifying wild animals, dragons, horned owls, tawny owls, vipers and haemorrhoids <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
, with thickets inhabited by ochim and tziim <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
where satyrs dance. When these creatures have been expelled by human labour and toil, the desert can be ploughed up and be brought into cultivation, the fields being planted first with oats, beans and flax, and later with barley and wheat.<p>Another comparison might be made with the wrong-doing which is so plentiful that it dominates human life; if wrong-doers were not chastised according to the law and punished by beatings or execution, no city, and equally no kingdom, could hold together. A person is like a small-scale community; if he were not to deal with himself in a spiritual fashion as wrong-doers are dealt with in a natural fashion in a large community, after death he would be chastised and punished, and this would continue until he desisted from evil for fear of punishment, though he could never be brought to do good for the love of good.<p>

531. This may be illustrated by the following comparisons. Before repentance man is like a desert where there are terrible wild beasts, dragons, owls of various kinds, vipers and poisonous serpents, and in the thickets are the ochim and the tziim, and there satyrs dance. But when these have been cast out by the industry and labor of man, that desert may be ploughed and made ready for planting, and sown first with oats, beans, and flax, and afterward with barley and wheat. Man before repentance may also be compared to the wickedness that reigns so largely among men where the wicked are not corrected according to law and punished by stripes or death, in which case no city, nor any kingdom even, could continue. Man is like a miniature society; unless he deals with himself in a spiritual manner, as the wicked in society at large are dealt with in a natural manner, after death he will be corrected and punished until he ceases to do evil for fear of the penalty, although he can never be brought to do good from the love of good. </p>

531. This may be illustrated by the following comparisons. A man before repentance is like a desert where there are terrible wild beasts, dragons, owls, screech owls, vipers and poisonous serpents; and in the thickets there, lewd spirits of the wood (ochim) and harpies of the desert (tziim) with dancing satyrs; but when these have been cast out by the industry and labor of men, the desert may be ploughed and turned into cultivated fields, in which may be sown oats, beans and flax, and afterwards barley and wheat. The unrepentant state may also be compared to the wickedness widely prevalent among men. Unless the wicked were chastised and punished according to law, with stripes or even death, no city or kingdom could stand. Man is, as it were, a society in miniature. Unless he dealt with himself spiritually as evil-doers in society at large are dealt with physically, after death he would be chastised and punished; and this would continue till he ceased to do evil from fear of punishment, even though he might never be induced to do good from the love of good. </p>

531. Hoc per sequentes Comparationes illustrari potest: Homo ante poenitentiam est tanquam desertum, in quo sunt terribiles ferae, dracones, bubones, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ululae, echidnae et haemorrhoides, et in dumetis ibi ochim et tziim, et saltant satyri; at postquam haec industria et opera hominum ejecta sunt, desertum illud potest exarari et excoli in arva, et eis inseminari primum avenae, fabae et linum, et postea hordea et tritica. Et quoque comparari potest cum malitia, quae in copia regnat apud homines, nisi malitiosi secundum leges castigarentur ac punirentur plagis aut morte, nulla urbs consisteret, pariter nullum regnum: Homo est sicut societas in minima forma, nisi similiter secum ageret spirituali modo, sicut agitur cum malitiosis in magna Societate naturali modo, ille post mortem castigaretur et puniretur, et hoc usque eo dum ex timore poenae malum non facit, tametsi nusquam redigi potest ad bonum faciendum ex amore boni.<p>
