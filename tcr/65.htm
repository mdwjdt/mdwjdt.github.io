<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>65</b>. （6）人被造为神性秩序的形式。人被造为神性秩序的形式，是因为他被造为神的形像和样式；由于神是秩序本身，故他被造为秩序的形像和样式。有两个要素使秩序存在并持续存在，就是圣爱与圣智；人被造为接受这二者的器皿。所以，他通过受造被赋予这个秩序，圣爱与圣智就照着该秩序在整个宇宙中运作，尤其照着该秩序在天使天堂运作，以致整个天堂就是一个最大规模的神性秩序形式，在神眼里看似一个人。而且，天堂与人之间存在完全的对应关系，因为天堂中的社群无不对应于某个身体部位，或人体内的脏腑或器官。由于这个原因，天堂的某个社群被说成位于肝、胰、脾、胃、眼、耳、舌等等区域。此外，天使本人知道自己身处这个人体哪个部位的哪个区域。我凭活生生的经历得以获知这是事实。我曾看见数千天使组成的社群显为一个人。这清楚表明，天堂整体上是神的形像，而神的形像就是神性秩序的形式。</p>

65. (6)人按聖規的形式被造。
<p>我們作為聖規的形式被造, 因為我們是按上帝的形像和樣式被造, 上帝是那定規本身, 因而我們是按那定規的形像和樣式被造。
<p>聖規最初的形成和持續的存在, 來自於兩個源頭:聖仁和聖智, 我們人類被造為接收這二者的器皿。因此, 這樣的定規——聖仁與聖智流入並作用於宇宙——就被建立在我們裡面。
<p>於是, 天國作為整體(聖規最大可能的彰顯)在上帝眼中就像一個人。天國與一個人完全地對應。天國中, 沒有哪個社區不對應於一個人身體或內或外某器官的某部分。由於這個原因, 天國中的某個社區會被說成位於肝,胰,脾,胃,眼,耳,舌等等區域。實際上, 天人自己都知道身處於這個身體的哪個部位。我曾有機會藉著親身經歷來認識這些, 因為我普見過一個數千天人一起組成一個人形的社區。從這次經歷讓我清楚, 天國作為整體是上帝的形像, 上帝的形像是聖規的形式。 </p>

65. 6. Human beings were created as forms of the divine design. We have been created as forms of the divine design because we have been created as images and likenesses of God, and since God is the design itself, we have therefore been created as images and likenesses of that design.
<p>The divine design originally took shape, and it continues to exist, from two sources: divine love and divine wisdom. We human beings have been created as vessels for these two things. Therefore the design that divine love and wisdom follow in acting upon the universe, and especially upon the angelic heaven, has been built into us.
<p>As a result, heaven in its entirety is a form of the divine design in its largest possible manifestation. In the sight of God, heaven is like one human being. The correspondence between heaven and a human being is in fact complete. There are no communities in heaven that do not answer to some part, some internal or external organ, of the human body. For this reason a given community in heaven is said to be in the province of the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the stomach, the eye, the ear, or the tongue, and so on. In fact, the angels themselves know which specific area within a given part of the human body they inhabit. I was given an opportunity to learn about this from living experience. I saw a community of several thousand angels together in the form of one human being. From that experience it became clear to me that heaven as a whole is an image of God, and an image of God is a form of the divine design. </p>

65. (vi) MAN WAS CREATED TO BE A FORM FOR DIVINE ORDER.<p>Man was created to be a form for Divine order, because he was created as an image and likeness of God; so since God is order itself, he was created as an image and likeness of order. The two factors which brought order into existence and preserve it in existence are the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom; and man was created to be a receiver of these. Consequently he was by creation endowed with the order according to which the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom act in the universe, and principally that according to which they act in the heaven of angels, so that this whole heaven is a form of Divine order on the largest scale, and in the sight of God it appears like one man. There is too a full correspondence between that heaven and man. For there is no community in heaven which does not correspond to some member, internal part or organ in the human body. So it is said in heaven that a certain community is in the province of the liver, or the pancreas, or the spleen, or the stomach, or the eye, or the ear, or the tongue, and so on. The angels themselves know under what part of the human body they come. The truth of this I was allowed to know by direct experience. I saw a community composed of some thousands of angels as one person. This showed plainly that heaven taken together is an image of God, and the image of God is a form of the Divine order. </p>

65. (6) Man was created a form of Divine order. Man was created a form of Divine order because he was created an image and likeness of God; and as God is order itself, he was created an image and likeness of order. There are two things which are the source of order and which give it permanence, namely, the Divine love and the Divine wisdom; and man was created a receptacle of these, and was therefore created also into the order in accordance with which these two act in the universe, and especially in accordance with which they act in the angelic heaven; consequently that the entire heaven is in its largest effigy a form of Divine order, and is in the sight of God like one man. Moreover, there is a plenary correspondence between that heaven and man; for there is not a society in heaven that does not correspond to some one of the members, viscera, or organs in man; and therefore it is there said that such a society is in the province of the liver, or of the pancreas, or of the spleen, or of the stomach, the eye, the ear, or the tongue, and so on. Furthermore, the angels themselves know in what region of any part of man they dwell. That this is so I have been permitted to learn by living experience. I have seen as a single man a society consisting of some thousands of angels; and thus it was made clear that heaven in its complex is an image of God; and an image of God is a form of Divine order. </p>

65. (6) MAN WAS CREATED A FORM OF DIVINE ORDER.<p>Man was created a form of Divine order because he was created an image and likeness of God; and because God is order itself, he was created an image and likeness of order. Order first originated and has since continued to subsist from these two, Divine Love and Divine Wisdom. As man was created to be a recipient of these, he was also created in the order according to which they operate in the universe, and especially according to which they operate in the angelic heaven, for the whole of heaven is thus a form of Divine order on the largest scale, and is in the sight of God as one man. There is also a complete correspondence between heaven and man; for there is not a single society in heaven which does not correspond to one of the members, viscera, or organs in man. Therefore in heaven it is said that such and such a society is in the province of the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the stomach, the eye, the ear, the tongue, and so forth. The angels themselves also know what part of the body is represented by the province in which they live. The truth of this I have been able to observe from actual demonstration. I have seen a society of angels, consisting of several thousands, as one man; from which it was evident to me that heaven in the aggregate is an image of God, and that an image of God is a form of Divine order. </p>

65. VI. QUOD HOMO CREATUS SIT FORMA DIVINI ORDINIS. Quod homo creatus sit forma Divini Ordinis, est quia creatus est imago et similitudo Dei, et quia Deus est ipse Ordo, creatus est imago et similitudo ordinis. Sunt duo ex quibus Ordo exstitit, et per quae subsistit, Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, et homo creatus est receptaculum eorum, quare etiam creatus est in ordinem, secundum quem illa duo agunt in Universo, et principaliter secundum quem agunt in Coelo angelico, inde totum illud Coelum est in maxima effigie forma Divini Ordinis, et Coelum illud in conspectu Dei est sicut unus Homo; et quoque est plenaria correspondentia inter Coelum illud et hominem; non enim datur in Coelo aliqua Societas, quae non correspondet alicui membro, visceri aut organo in homine; quare dicitur in Coelo, quod haec Societas sit vel in provincia Hepatis, vel Pancreatis, vel Lienis, vel Ventriculi, vel Oculi, vel Auris, vel Linguae, et sic porro; ipsi Angeli etiam sciunt in qua ditione alicujus Partis hominis habitant: quod ita sit, ad vivum mihi scire datum est; vidi Societatem ex aliquot millibus Angelorum constantem ut unum hominem; ex quo patuit, quod Coelum in complexu sit imago Dei, et imago Dei est forma Divini Ordinis. </p>
