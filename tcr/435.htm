<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">仁爱的第一步是逐出邪恶，第二步是行出有益邻舍的良善</h4><br />435.在仁爱的教义中，下面这句话扮演主要角色：第一，不要对邻舍行恶，第二，要向邻舍行善。这个信条可以说是形成通往仁爱教义的大门。众所周知，邪恶自人出生时就居于他的意愿中；由于一切邪恶皆针对或近或远的人，以及社群和国家，故可知，遗传的邪恶就是直接针对不同程度邻舍的邪恶。人凭理性本身也能看出，只要居于意愿中的邪恶没有被移除，他所行的良善就会浸渍于这邪恶中。因为在这种情况下，邪恶就在良善中，就象果核在果壳中或骨髓在骨头中。所以，这种人所行的良善尽管看似良善，但本质上并非良善。它就象光滑的外壳，里面的核仁已被蛀虫啃光；还象从内里一直烂到表面的白杏仁。<br />意欲恶和行出善本质上是两个对立面。因为恶属于对邻舍的恨，而善属于对邻舍的爱。或说，恶是邻舍的敌人，善是邻舍的朋友。这二者无法共存于同一个心智中，也就是说，恶居于内在人，而善居于外在人。倘若共存，外在的善就会像表面治愈、内里有腐烂物质的伤口。这时，人就象一棵烂了根的树，所结的果子仍是外表看起来完好、有用，而里面却令人恶心、无用。这种人又象废弃的渣滓，它们表面被抛光并涂上美丽的颜色后，被当成宝石来出售。总之，他们就象冒充鸽子蛋的猫头鹰的蛋。<br />当知道，人藉着身体行出来的良善是从他的灵，也就是内在人发出的。内在人就是死后仍活着的灵。所以，当这种人脱去构成其外在人的肉体后，他整个人完全被邪恶控制，并乐在其中，躲避良善如攻击他生命之物。<br />主在很多经文中教导说，在恶被除去之前，人无法行出本质为善之善：<br />荆棘上岂能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜里岂能摘无花果呢？坏树不能结好果子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.16.htm">马太福音7:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.18.htm">18</a>）<br />你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯盘的里面，好叫外面也干净了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.25.htm">马太福音23:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.26.htm">26</a>）<br />你们要洗濯、自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行，要止住作恶，学习行善，寻求公平，你们的罪虽像朱红，必变成雪白；虽红如丹颜，必白如羊毛（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.16.htm">以赛亚书1:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.18.htm">18</a>）。</p>

435. 接近義的第一步是離惡; 第二步是向善
<p>關於義的教導中, 下列觀點最為基本:接近義的第一步是不要對鄰舍作惡; 第二步是對鄰舍行善。這是通往義之教導的入門。
<p>人們知道, 從出生時起, 惡就居住在每個人的意志之中。因為每一種惡都對準或近或遠的目標, 包括社群和國家, 因此遺傳的惡以惡對各個層級的鄰舍。
<p>只要居於意志之中的惡沒有移除, 人所行之善中就懷有此惡。惡在善中, 如同核在殼中或髓在骨中。因此, 這樣的人所行之善, 外表看起來像善, 然而內在的並非是善。因為它就像光澤的外殼, 裡面的核仁已被蛆蟲啃光。它還像一顆內部腐爛的白杏仁, 腐爛的紋路滲到表面。
<p>[2]意圖作惡與行出良善是本質上對立的兩回事。因為惡來自於恨鄰舍, 而善來自於愛鄰舍。或者說, 惡是鄰舍的敵人, 善是鄰舍的朋友。這些無法共存於一個思想之中——也就是, 惡在內在人中, 而善於外在人中。如果可以這樣, 在外的良善就會像經過表面處理的傷口, 裡面卻是腐臭的膿包。這樣的人就像一棵爛了根的樹, 結的果子外表看起來可口有用, 裡面苦澀無用。這樣的善行還像廢棄的礦渣, 將它們表面打磨並塗刷靚色, 當作寶石出售。簡言之, 就像把貓頭鷹的蛋充當鴿子蛋。
<p>[3]人們當知道, 一個人身體所行的善事來自於他的靈, 也就是內在人。內在人就是死後仍活著的靈。因此當惡人脫去外在的肉身後, 他們就完全由自己的惡構成。於是, 他就完全徹底地受惡的控制, 並享受這些惡。他們遠避良善, 視之為對他們生命的威脅。
<p>[4]主在許多經文中教導, 一個人在惡被除去之前無法行出本質的善:
<p>荊棘上豈能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜裡豈能摘無花果呢？壞樹不能結好果子(<a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">馬太福音7:16</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_18.htm">18</a>)
<p>你們這假冒為善的文士和法利賽人有禍了！因為你們洗淨杯盤的外面, 裡面卻盛滿了勒索和放蕩。你這瞎眼的法利賽人, 先洗淨杯盤的裡面, 好叫外面也乾淨了。(<a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">馬太福音23:25-26</a>)
<p>你們要洗濯,自潔, 從我眼前除掉你們的惡行, 要止住作惡, 學習行善, 尋求公平, 你們的罪雖像朱紅, 必變成雪白; 雖紅如丹顏, 必白如羊毛。(<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">以賽亞書1:16-18</a>) </p>

435. The First Step toward Goodwill Is Removing Evils; the Second Step Is Doing Good Things That Are Useful to Our Neighbor
<p>Among teachings on goodwill the following point is primary: the first step toward goodwill is not to do evil to our neighbor. A secondary point is to do good to our neighbor. This is like a doorway to the teachings on goodwill.
<p>As people generally know, evil dwells in the will of every human being from birth. Because all evil targets someone nearby or far away, including the wider community and the country, it follows that hereditary evil is evil against our neighbor on every scale.
<p>On the basis of reason itself we can all see that the less we remove the evil that dwells in our will, the more the good we do is pregnant with that evil, because then evil exists inside the goodness like a kernel in a shell or the marrow in a bone. Therefore although good things that someone does in that state appear to be good, they are nevertheless not good inside. They are like a shiny shell containing a nut that has been consumed by worms. They are like a white almond that has rottenness inside it, so that rotten streaks have crept up to the surface.
</p>
<p>
[2] Intending evil and doing good are two things that are intrinsically opposite to each other. Evil comes from hatred for our neighbor and good comes from love for our neighbor. Or to put it another way, evil is an enemy to our neighbor and goodness is our neighbor's friend. The two cannot exist in a single mind, that is, there cannot be evil in our inner self and goodness in our outer self. If there were, the goodness on the outside would be like a wound that has been superficially treated, beneath which there lies the pus of an infection. We ourselves would then be like a tree whose roots are unsound; it produces pieces of fruit that outwardly look tasty and beneficial, although inwardly they are rotten and useless. Our good deeds would also be like pieces of rejected slag, superficially polished and beautifully colored, which are offered for sale as precious stones. Briefly put, these good deeds would be like the eggs of an owl mistaken for the eggs of a dove.
</p>
<p>
[3] It is important to know that the good things people accomplish with the body come from the spirit or the inner self. The inner self is their spirit, which lives after death. Therefore when [evil] people cast away the body that formed their outer self, they are made up of nothing but their own evils. They enjoy these evils and steer away from goodness as a threat to the way they live.
</p>
<p>
[4] The Lord teaches in many passages that we cannot do good things that are intrinsically good before evil has been removed from us:
<p>Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? A rotten tree cannot produce good fruit. (<a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">Matthew 7:16-18</a>)
<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees. You clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but the insides are full of plundering and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside may become clean as well. (<a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>)
<p>And in Isaiah,
<p>Wash yourselves. Remove the evil of your actions. Stop doing evil. Learn to do what is good; seek [good] judgment. Then if your sins had been like scarlet, they will become as white as snow. If they had been red as crimson, they will be like wool. (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>) </p>

435. XII. The first thing in charity is to banish evils, the second is to do good deeds which may be of use to the neighbour.<p>The leading role in the doctrine of charity is played by this statement, that the first thing is not to do evil to the neighbour, the second is to do good to him. This dogma forms as it were a gateway leading to the doctrine of charity, It is well known that from birth everyone has evil lodged in his will; and because every evil is aimed at people both near and far, as well as one's community and country, it follows that hereditary evil is evil directed against the neighbour of whatever degree. Reason itself can show anyone that in so far as the evil lodged in the will is not removed, so far is the good he does impregnated with that evil. For in that case the evil is inside the good, like a kernel in a nut-shell or marrow in a bone. Although therefore the good done by such a person looks like good, it is not intrinsically good. For it is like a glistening shell within which the kernel is eaten away by maggots; and like a white almond which is rotten inside, so that rotting passages extend to the surface.</p>
<p>
[2] Willing evil and doing good are essentially two opposites. For evil is the product of hatred directed against the neighbour, good that of love towards the neighbour; or if you like, evil is the neighbour's enemy, good is his friend. These two cannot both exist in one mind, that is, the evil in the internal man, the good in the external man; if it does, the good in the external is like a wound treated with palliatives, but containing rotten pus inside it. A person then resembles a tree with a worn-out root, yet producing fruit which outwardly seems to be tasty and fit to use, but inwardly is bitter and useless. Such people are also like dross thrown away, which when superficially polished and given pretty colouring is put up for sale as precious stones. In short, they are like owl's eggs passed off as those of a dove.</p>
<p>
[3] People should know that the good a person does in his body comes from his spirit, that is, the internal man. (The internal man is the spirit which lives on after death.) Consequently when such a person puts off the body, which made up his external man, then he is totally and utterly in the grip of evils, and takes pleasure in them, eschewing good as attacking his life.</p>
<p>
[4] The Lord teaches in many passages that a person cannot do good which is essentially good until evil has been removed:<p>They do not gather the grape from thorns, nor figs from thistles; a rotten tree cannot produce good fruit, <a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">Matthew 7:16-18</a>.<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees; you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but the insides are full of robbery and intemperance. You blind Pharisee, clean first the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside too may be clean, <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>.<p>And in Isaiah:<p>Wash yourselves, remove the wickedness of your deeds; cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek judgment. Then if your sins were as scarlet, they will become white as snow, if they were red like purple, they shall be like wool, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>. </p>

435. XII. THE FIRST THING OF CHARITY IS TO PUT AWAY EVILS; AND THE SECOND IS TO DO GOODS THAT ARE OF USE TO THE NEIGHBOR. <p>In the doctrine of charity this holds the first place, that the first thing of charity is not to do evil to the neighbor; and to do good to him holds the second place. This tenet is like a door to the doctrine of charity. It is admitted that evil is firmly seated in every man's will from his birth; and as all evil has relation to man both nearly and remotely, and also to society and one's country, it follows that inherited evil is evil against the neighbor in every degree. A man may see from reason itself, that so far as the evil resident in the will is not put away, the good that he does is impregnated with that evil; for evil is then inside the good, like a kernel in its shell or like marrow in a bone; therefore although the good that is done by such a man appears to be good, still intrinsically it is not good; for it is like a healthy-looking shell containing a worm-eaten kernel, or like a white almond rotten within, with streaks of rottenness extending even to the surface.
</p>
<p>
[2] Willing evil and doing right are two essentially opposite things; for evil belongs to hatred towards the neighbor and good belongs to love towards the neighbor, or evil is the neighbor's enemy and good is his friend. These two cannot exist in the same mind, that is, evil in the internal man and good in the external; if they do, the good in the external is like a wound superficially healed, within which there is putrid matter. Man is then like a tree with a decayed root, which still produces fruit that outwardly looks like well-flavored and useful fruit, but is inwardly offensive and useless. He is also like rejected scoria, which, being bright on the surface and beautifully colored, may be sold for precious stones; in a word, he is like an owl's egg, which men are made to believe to be a dove's egg.
</p>
<p>
[3] Man ought to know that the good that a man does by means of his body proceeds from his spirit, or out of his internal man, the internal man being the spirit which lives after death. Therefore when the man [above described] casts off the body which formed his external man, all there is of him is in evils and takes delight in them, and is averse to good as something inimical to his life.
</p>
<p>
[4] That until evil has been put away man cannot do good that is good in itself the Lord teaches in many places: <p>Men do not gather the grape from thorns or figs from thistles. A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit (<a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">Matthew 7:16-18</a>). <p>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside of them may become clean also (<a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>). <p>And in Isaiah: <p>Wash you, put away the evil of your doings, cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment. Then although your sins have been as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow; although they have been red like crimson, they shall be as wool (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>). </p>

This tenet is as a door to the doctrine of charity.

A man may see from reason itself that as far as the evil implanted in his will is not removed, it taints the good he does with evil; for evil lies within the good like a nut in its shell, or marrow in a bone. Although what a man then does has the appearance of good, yet inwardly it is not so, for it is like a beautiful shell containing a worm-eaten nut, or like a white almond that is rotten inside, with its corrupt veins extending even to the surface.</p>
<p>
[2] To will evil and to do good are opposite in their nature, evil being grounded in hatred towards the neighbor and good in love towards him; or in other words, evil is the enemy of the neighbor and good is his friend. These two cannot exist in one and the same mind, that is, evil in the internal man and good in the external; for then good in the external man would be like a wound superficially healed, but inwardly septic. A man in such a case is like a tree with a decayed root, producing fruit which outwardly appears of fine flavor and fit for use, but inwardly is rotten and useless; or like polished and beautifully colored pieces of refiner's slag, which are sold as precious stones; in other words, they are like the eggs of an owl which one is induced to believe are the eggs of a dove.</p>
<p>
[3] Everyone should know that the good which a man does in the body proceeds from his spirit, or internal man, for this is his spirit which lives after death. When, therefore, a man puts off the body which constituted his external man, then, as far as he is in evils, he takes delight in them, and hates the good as inimical to his life.</p>
<p>
[4] That a man cannot do good which is truly so before evil is put away, the Lord teaches in many places:<p>'They do not gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles. A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.' <a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">Matthew 7:16-18</a>.<p>"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees!... for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also" <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>.<p>And in Isaiah:<p>"Wash you... put away the evil of your doings... cease to do evil: Learn to do well; seek judgment...

435. Quod Primum Charitatis sit amovere mala, et Secundum ejus facere bona, quae usui proximo sunt.<p>In Doctrina Charitatis primas partes tenet hoc, quod primum Charitatis sit non facere malum proximo, et secundas, facere bonum illi; hoc dogmaticum est sicut janua ad doctrinam Charitatis. Notum est, quod cujusvis hominis voluntati a nativitate insideat malum, et quia omne malum spectat hominem prope se et procul a se, et quoque Societatem et Patriam, sequitur quod malum haereditarium sit malum contra proximum in omni gradu. Homo ex ipsa ratione potest videre, quod quantum malum Voluntati insidens non removetur, tantum bonum quod facit, illo malo impraegnatum sit, est enim tunc malum intus in bono, sicut nucleus in crusta, et sicut medulla in osse, quare tametsi bonum, quod fit ab homine tali, apparet ut bonum, usque intrinsecus non est bonum, est enim sicut crusta nitida, intra quam nucleus est erosus a vermibus, et est sicut amygdalum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
album, intra quod est putredo, e qua venae putres usque ad superficiem prorepunt.</p>
<p>
[2] Malum velle et bonum facere, sunt in se duo opposita, malum enim est odii contra proximum, et bonum est amoris erga proximum, seu malum est hostis proximi, et bonum est amicus ejus; illa duo non possunt in una mente dari, hoc est, in Interno homine malum, et in Externo homine bonum; si datur, est bonum in Externo sicut vulnus palliative curatum, in quo intus est sanies putrescens. Homo tunc est sicut Arbor cujus radix est obsoleta, et tamen producit fructus, qui extrinsecus apparent sicut fructus saporis et usus, sed intrinsecus sunt tetri et inutiles; sunt etiam sicut scoriae rejectae, quae extrinsecus politae et pulchre coloratae pro lapidibus pretiosis venditantur; verbo sunt sicut ova bubonis, de quibus inducitur fides quod sint ova columbae.</p>
<p>
[3] Sciat homo, quod bonum, quod homo facit Corpore, procedat a spiritu ejus, seu ex Interno homine; Internus homo est spiritus ejus qui vivit post mortem, quare dum homo rejicit corpus, quod fecit Externum ejus hominem, tunc totus quantus est in malis, et in his se jucundat, et aversatur bonum sicut infestum vitae suae.</p>
<p>
[4] Quod homo non possit facere bonum, quod in se bonum est, priusquam remotum est malum, docet Dominus multis in locis, Non colligunt de spinis uvam, aut de tribulis ficus; putris arbor non potest fructus bonos facere, <a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">Matthaeus 7:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_18.htm">18</a>.
