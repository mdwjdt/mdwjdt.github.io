<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>376</b>.仁与信若仅停留在身体领域，即头脑中，而非植根于行为中，对人来说一点用也没有。这一点从圣言中上千段经文明显看出来，我只从中引用其中的一部分：<br />凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.19.htm">马太福音7:19</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.21.htm">21</a>）<br />祂撒种在好土里，这人留心听了道，就结实。耶稣说完这话，就大声喊着说，有耳可听的，就应当听。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.3.htm">马太福音13:3</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">43</a>）<br />耶稣回答说，听了神之道而遵行的人，就是我的母亲，我的弟兄了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">路加福音8:21</a>）<br />我们知道神不听罪人，惟有敬奉神，遵行祂旨意的，神才听他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.31.htm">约翰福音9:31</a>）<br />你们既知道这事，若是去行就有福了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.17.htm">约翰福音13:17</a>）<br />有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的，我也要爱他，向他显现。并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.15.htm">约翰福音14:15</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>）<br />你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.8.htm">约翰福音15:8</a>）<br />不是听律法的为义，乃是行律法的称义。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.13.htm">罗马书2:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/雅1.22.htm">雅各书1:22</a>）<br />在震怒与公义审判的日子，神必照各人的行为报应各人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.5.htm">罗马书2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.6.htm">6</a>）<br />因为我们众人必要在基督台前显露出来，叫各人按着本身所行的，或善或恶受报。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/林后5.10.htm">哥林多后书5:10</a>）<br />人子要在祂父的荣耀里，同着众使者降临；那时候，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">马太福音16:27</a>）<br />我听见从天上有声音说，你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的人有福了。圣灵说，是的，他们息了自己的劳苦；作工的果效也随着他们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.13.htm">启示录14:13</a>）<br />案卷展开，死了的人都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判。他们都照各人所行的受审判。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">启示录20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.13.htm">13</a>）<br />看哪！我必快来。赏罚在我，要照各人所行的报应他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">启示录22:12</a>）<br />耶和华注目观看世人一切的举动，为要照各人所行的和他作事的结果报应他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.19.htm">耶利米书32:19</a>）<br />我必因他们所行的惩罚他们，照他们所作的报应他们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.9.htm">何西阿书4:9</a>）<br />耶和华按我们的行动作为向我们怎样行，他已照样行了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.6.htm">撒迦利亚书1:6</a>）<br />还有上千段这样的经文。<br />由此可见，仁与信在付诸于行动之前，还算不上仁与信。若只停留在行为之上的半空中，即脑海里，仁与信就象空中的会幕或神殿，这些东西无非是海市蜃楼，会自动消失；或象被书虫吃掉的纸上的绘画；又象住在没有卧室的屋顶上，而不是住在屋里。所有这一切表明，仁与信只要停留在精神概念上，而不是尽可能付诸行动，共同存在于行为中，就会消失。</p>

<p>
376. 義與信只是停留在頭腦的範圍內, 卻非停駐于行為之中, 這樣的義與信對人無濟於事。聖言中有千百次類似的表述, 我從中引述一部分如下:
<p>凡不結好果子的樹, 砍下來丟在火裡(<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">馬太福音7:19-21</a>)。撒種在好土裡的, 是人留心聽了道, 並結實。當耶穌說完這些時, 祂大聲說:"有耳可聽的, 就應當聽"(<a href="3927/matthew_13_3.htm">馬太福音13:3-9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_43.htm">43</a>)。耶穌回答說:"聽了上帝之道而遵行的人, 就是我的母親, 我的弟兄了"(<a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">路加福音8:21</a>)。我們知道上帝不聽罪人, 惟有敬奉上帝, 遵行祂旨意的, 上帝才聽他(<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">約翰福音9:31</a>)。你們既知道這事, 若是去行就有福了(<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">約翰福音13:17</a>)。有了我的命令又遵守的, 這人就是愛我的, 我也要愛他, 並且要向他顯現。並且我們要到他那裡去, 與他同住(<a href="3927/john_14_15.htm">約翰福音14:15-21</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>)。你們多結果子, 我父就因此得榮耀(<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">約翰福音15:8</a>)。不是聽律法的為義, 乃是行律法的稱義(<a href="3927/romans_2_13.htm">羅馬書2:13</a>;<a href="3927/james_1_22.htm">雅各書1:22</a>)。在震怒與公義審判的日子, 上帝必照各人的行為報應各人(<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">羅馬書2:5-6</a>)。因為我們眾人必要在基督台前顯露出來, 叫各人按著本身所行的, 或善或惡受報(<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">哥林多後書5:10</a>)。人子要在祂父的榮耀裡, 同著眾使者降臨; 那時候, 祂要照各人的行為報應各人(<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">馬太福音16:27</a>)。我聽見從天上有聲音說:"你要寫下:從今以後, 在主裡面而死的人有福了。"聖靈說:"是的, 他們息了自己的勞苦; 作工的行為也隨著他們"(<a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">啟示錄14:13</a>)。生命冊打開, 死了的人都憑著這些案卷所記載的, 照他們所行的受審判。他們都照各人所行的受審判(<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">啟示錄20:12-13</a>)。看哪！我必快來。賞罰在我, 要照各人所行的報應他(<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">啟示錄22:12</a>)。耶和華注目觀看世人一切的舉動, 為要照各人所行的和他作事的結果報應他(<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">耶利米書32:19</a>)。我必因他們所行的懲罰他們, 照他們所作的報應他們(<a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">何西阿書4:9</a>)。耶和華按我們的行動作為向我們怎樣行, 他已照樣行了(<a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">撒迦利亞書1:6</a>)。
<p>還有許多其他類似的經文。
<p>這些可以證明, 義與信在實現于行為中以前, 並非義與信。倘若義與信只是停在行為之上的空中或頭腦裡, 它們就像會幕或聖殿的海市蜃樓。或者像紙上繪畫被書蟲吞噬。或者就像人住在房頂, 而且沒有床, 而不是住在房子裡面。
<p>於是可讓人明白, 義與信只不過是多變的精神層面的概念而已, 除非有機會轉變成行為, 並且體現在行為中。 </p>

<p>
376. Goodwill and faith do nothing for us when they are attached to only one part of our body (meaning our head) but are not anchored in actions. This is clear from a thousand passages in the Word, of which I will cite only the following here:
<p>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. (<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-21</a>)
<p>"Those who are sown in good earth are people who hear the Word and pay attention, and bear and produce fruit. " When Jesus had said this he cried out, saying, "Those who have ears to hear must hear. " (<a href="3927/matthew_13_39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_43.htm">43</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "My mother and my brothers and sisters are those who hear the Word of God and do it. " (<a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>)
<p>We know that God does not hear sinners, but if people worship God and do his will, he hears them. (<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>)
<p>If you know these things, you are happy if you do them. (<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>)
<p>Those who have my commandments and do them are the people who love me. I will love them and will manifest myself to them. I will come to them and make my home with them. (<a href="3927/john_14_15.htm">John 14:15-21</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>)
<p>My Father is glorified by your bearing much fruit. (<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>)
<p>Hearers of the law are not justified by God, but doers of the law are. (<a href="3927/romans_2_13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>; <a href="3927/james_1_22.htm">James 1:22</a>)
<p>In the day of anger and just judgment, God will repay all according to their works. (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>)
<p>It is right for us all to appear before Christ's judgment seat, so that each of us may carry away what we have done through our body in regard to those things, whether good or evil. (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>)
<p>The Son of Humankind is going to come in the glory of his Father. Then he will repay all according to their deeds. (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)
<p>I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. The Spirit says that they will rest from their labors. Their works follow them. " (<a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>)
<p>A book is opened, which is the book of life, and the dead are judged according to the things that are written in the book. All are judged according to their works. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>)
<p>Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me to give to all according to their work. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>)
<p>Jehovah, whose eyes are open to all the ways of human beings, to give to them all according to their ways and according to the fruit of their works. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>)
<p>I will bring judgment upon them according to their ways and will reward their works. (<a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>)
<p>Jehovah deals with us according to our ways and according to our works. (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>)
<p>There are thousands of other passages like these.
<p>On this basis one can clearly see that goodwill and faith are not goodwill and faith before they exist in actions. If they exist only up in the sky or in the mind above actions, they are like images of a tabernacle or a church in the air that are just strange aerial phenomena that spontaneously disappear. They are like paintings on paper that bookworms are chewing through. They are like our living on a roof with no bed rather than in a house.
<p>From all this you can see that goodwill and faith are transient entities when they are merely mental - unless, when there is an opportunity for us to do them, they culminate in actions and become embodied in them. </p>

376. Charity and faith are of no use to a person, so long as they remain merely in the bodily hemisphere, that is, in his head, and are not given a firm base in deeds; this is evident from a thousand passages in the Word, of which I shall quote only the following.<p>Every tree which does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire, <a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-21</a>.<p>He who sows on good soil is the person who hears the Word and pays attention to it, and bears and produces fruit. When Jesus said this, he cried out saying, He who has ears to hear with, let him hear, <a href="3927/matthew_13_9.htm">Matthew 13:9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>.<p>Jesus said, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the Word of God and act upon it, <a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>.<p>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone worships God, and does His will, He listens to him, <a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>.<p>If you know these things, you are blessed if you act upon them, <a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>.<p>He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me, and I shall love him, and show myself to him; and I shall come to him and make my dwelling with him, <a href="3927/john_14_15.htm">John 14:15-21</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>.<p>In this my Father is glorified, in that you bear much fruit, <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_16.htm">16</a>.<p>It is not those who hear the law, but those who keep it, who are made righteous by God, <a href="3927/romans_2_13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>; <a href="3927/james_1_22.htm">James 1:22</a>.<p>On the day of wrath and righteous judgment, God will render to each in accordance with his deeds, <a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>.<p>We must all be put on show before the tribunal of Christ, so that each may be rewarded for our bodily acts, whether good or ill. <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p>The Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father, and then He will reward each man in accordance with his deeds, <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.<p>I heard a voice from heaven saying, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. So says the Spirit, so that they may rest from their labours; their deeds accompany them, <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>.<p>The book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged according to what was written in the book, everyone according to his deeds, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.<p>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, so that I may give to each according to what he has done, <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.<p>Jehovah, whose eyes are open upon all the behaviour of men, to give to each in accordance with his behaviour, and in accordance with the fruit of his deeds, <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>.<p>I will punish his behaviour, and his deeds I will repay him, <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>.<p>Jehovah deals with us according to our behaviour and according to our deeds, <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>.<p>There are a thousand other such passages.</p>
<p>
[2] These prove that charity and faith are not charity and faith until they are realised in deeds, and if they merely exist above the level of deeds in space, or in the mind, they are as it were images of a tent or a temple in the air, which are nothing but atmospheric phenomena which vanish of their own accord; or they resemble paintings on paper which are eaten by bookworms; or they are like dwellings on a roof, lacking a bedroom, and not in the house. These comparisons will enable one to see that charity and faith are unstable, so long as they remain mental concepts, unless, when possible, they are realised in deeds and come into existence jointly in deeds. </p>

376. That charity and faith do not profit a man so long as they remain only in one part of his body, that is, in his head, and are not fixed in works, is evident from a thousand passages in the Word, of which I will here adduce only these: <p>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire (<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-21</a>). <p>He that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the Word and attendeth, who also beareth fruit and bringeth forth. And when Jesus had said these things, He cried, saying, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear (<a href="3927/matthew_13_3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_43.htm">43</a>). <p>Jesus said, My mother and My brethren are these who hear the Word of God and do it (<a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>). <p>Now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshiper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth (<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>). <p>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them (<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>). <p>He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him; and will come unto him and make My abode with him (<a href="3927/john_14_15.htm">John 14:15-21</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>). <p>Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit (<a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_16.htm">16</a>). For not the hearers of the law shall be justified by God, but the doers of the law (<a href="3927/romans_2_13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>; <a href="3927/james_1_22.htm">James 1:22</a>). <p>In the day of wrath and of righteous judgment God will render to every man according to his deeds (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5, 6</a>). <p>For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body according to what he hath done, whether good or bad (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). <p>For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father, and then He shall render unto everyone according to his deeds (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>). <p>I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow with them (<a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). <p>A Book was opened, which is the Book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the Book; every man according to his works (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 13</a>). <p>Behold I come quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every man according to his work (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). <p>Jehovah, whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give to everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his works (<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). <p>I will punish him according to his ways, and will recompense him for his works (<a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>). <p>According to our ways, and according to our works Jehovah does with us (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>). <p>So also in many other passages. From this it can be seen that charity and faith are not charity and faith until they exist in works, and that while they exist only in the expanse above works, that is, in the mind, they are like appearances of a tabernacle or temple in the air, which are nothing but a mirage, and vanish of themselves; or they are like pictures drawn on paper which moths consume; or they are like an abode on a housetop where there is no sleeping-place, instead of in the house. All this shows that charity and faith are perishable things so long as they are merely mental or unless they are determined to works and coexist in them when possible. </p>

(A.V., against the day of wrath and... of the righteous judgment of God, who will render). <a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>.<p>"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad" <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p>"For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father... and then He shall reward every man according to his works" <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.<p>"I heard a voice from heaven saying... Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth... saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them" <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>.<p>"A book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book (A.V., books)... every man according to their works. <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.<p>"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be" <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.<p>Jehovah, whose eyes "are open upon all the ways... of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings" <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>.<p>"I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings" <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>.<p>"According to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath Jehovah (A.V., He) dealt with us" <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>.<p>So also is it written in a thousand other passages.<p>From all this it may be evident that charity and faith are not charity and faith before they exist in works. If they only exist on the plane of the mind above works they are like forms of tabernacle or temple in the air, merely unsubstantial appearances which vanish of themselves. They are like pictures on a piece of paper eaten away by moths, or like lodgings on a roof-top, where there is no bed-chamber, instead of within the house. Hence it may now be seen that charity and faith are but fleeting things as long as they remain mental abstractions, and unless, whenever it is possible, they are expressed in works, and exist together in them. </p>

376. Quod Charitas et Fides nihil conducant homini, dum solum in ejus corporis haemisphaerio, hoc est, in ejus Capite, haerent, et non firmata sunt in operibus, constat ex mille locis in Verbo, e quibus solum haec afferam, Omnis Arbor, quae non FACIT FRUCTUM BONUM, exscinditur et in ignem conjicitur, <a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthaeus 7:19-21</a>. Ille qui in terram bonam seminatus est, hic est qui Verbum audit et attendit, ET FRUCTUM FERT ET FACIT; cum haec dixit Jesus, exclamabat, dicens, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
qui habet aures ad audiendum, audiat, <a href="3927/matthew_13_3.htm">Matthaeus 13:3-9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Jesus dixit, Mater mea, et fratres mei hi sunt, qui audiunt Verbum Dei et FACIUNT ILLUD, <a href="3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luca 8:21</a>. Scimus quod peccatores Deus non audiat, sed si quis Deum colit, et VOLUNTATEM EJUS FACIT, hunc audit, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
<a href="3927/john_9_31.htm">Johannes 9:31</a>. Si haec scitis, <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
beati estis si FECERITIS ILLA, <a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">Johannes 13:17</a>. Qui habet praecepta mea, et FACIT ILLA, is est qui amat Me, et Ego amabo illum, et manifestabo illi Me Ipsum, et ad illum veniam, et mansionem apud illum faciam, <a href="3927/john_14_15.htm">Johannes 14:15-21</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>. <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>

Non auditores Legis justificantur a Deo, <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
sed factores Legis, <a href="3927/romans_2_13.htm">Romanos 2:13</a>, <a href="3927/james_1_22.htm">Jacobus 1:22</a>. Deus in die irae et justi judicii, reddet unicuique SECUNDUM OPERA EJUS, <a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romanos 2:5-6</a>. Omnes nos manifestari oportet coram Tribunali Christi, ut reportet quilibet ea, QUAE PER CORPUS PROUT ILLA FECIT, <sup "fn120_10">10</sup>
sive bonum sive malum, <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthios 5:10</a>. Venturus est Filius hominis in gloria Patris sui, et tunc REDDET UNICUIQUE SECUNDUM FACTA EJUS, <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthaeus 16:27</a>. Audivi vocem e Coelo dicentem, beati mortui, qui in Domino moriuntur a nunc; dicit Spiritus, ut requiescant ex laboribus suis, OPERA ILLORUM SEQUUNTUR CUM ILLIS, <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Apocalypsis 14:13</a>. Liber apertus est qui est vitae, et judicati sunt mortui juxta ea quae <sup "fn120_11">11</sup>
scripta in libro, OMNES SECUNDUM OPERA ILLORUM, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Apocalypsis 20:12-13</a>. <sup "fn120_12">12</sup>
Ecce venio cito, et merces mea Mecum, ut dem unicuique SECUNDUM OPUS EJUS, <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Apocalypsis 22:12</a>. Jehovah, cujus oculi aperti sunt super omnes <sup "fn120_13">13</sup>
vias hominum, ad dandum cuivis secundum vias ejus, et SECUNDUM FRUCTUM OPERUM EJUS, <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremias 32:19</a>. <sup "fn120_14">14</sup>
Visitabo <sup "fn120_15">15</sup>
secundum vias ejus, et OPERA EJUS RETRIBUAM ILLI, <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hoschea 4:9</a>. Jehovah juxta vias nostras, et JUXTA OPERA NOSTRA FACIT NOBISCUM, <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Sacharia 1:6</a>, praeter in millenis aliis locis.</p>
<p>
[2] Ex his constare potest, quod Charitas et Fides non sint charitas et fides priusquam in Operibus sunt, et quod si modo supra Opera sunt in Expanso, seu in Mente, sint sicut imagines Tabernaculi <sup "fn120_16">16</sup>
aut Templi in aere, quae non sunt nisi Meteora, et disparantur a seipsis: et quod sint sicut Picturae super charta, quas blattae consumunt: ut et quod sint sicut Habitacula super Tecto, ubi non cubile, et non in domo. Ex his nunc videri potest, quod Charitas et Fides sint res caducae, dum solum sunt mentales, nisi, dum fieri potest, determinentur in Opera, et in illis coexistant.<p>
