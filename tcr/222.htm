<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>222</b>.（6）变像时的主代表在其荣耀中的圣言。关于主在彼得、雅各和约翰面前变像，我们读到：<br />祂的脸明亮如日头，祂的衣裳洁白如光，有摩西、以利亚显现，同祂说话；有一朵光明的云彩遮盖门徒，只听见有声音从云彩里说，这是我的爱子，你们要听他！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.1.htm">马太福音17:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.5.htm">5</a>）<br />我被告知：那时，主代表圣言。其明亮如日头的脸代表其圣爱之圣善；其洁白如光的衣裳代表其圣智之圣真。摩西和以利亚代表圣言的历史和预言部分；摩西代表通过他所写的圣言，以及总体上历史部分的圣言；以利亚代表圣言的整个预言部分。遮盖门徒的光明云彩代表字义上的圣言；这就是为何会听见有声音从云彩里说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听祂”。因为从天上来的一切声明和回应只通过诸如圣言字义那样的最外在形式给出，因为它们从主获得其完全。</p>

222. (6)變像時的主代表聖言的榮耀。
<p>我們讀到, 主在彼得,雅各和約翰面前變像, 祂的臉明亮如日頭, 祂的衣裳潔白如光, 見到摩西和以利亞與祂說話, 一朵光明的雲彩遮蓋門徒們, 有聲音從雲彩中出來:這是我的愛子, 你們要聽祂(<a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">馬太福音17:1-5</a>)。
<p>我曾被教導, 主代表聖言。祂的臉閃耀如日頭, 代表祂聖仁的聖善(神性的良善); 祂的衣裳潔白如光, 代表祂聖智的聖理(神性的真理)。摩西和以利亞代表聖言的歷史和預言部分。摩西代表藉他之手所寫的那部分聖言, 以及總體上歷史部分的聖言。以利亞代表聖言的全部預言部分。遮蓋門徒的光明雲彩代表文字意義上的聖言。這就是為何有聲音從雲彩出來:這是我的愛子, 你們要聽祂。因為所有從天上來的聲明與回應只會通過最外在的形式來表達, 也就是聖言的文字意義, 因為它們從主獲得完全。 </p>

222. 6. When the Lord was transfigured, he represented the Word in its glory. Of the Lord's transfiguration before Peter, James, and John, we read that his face shone like the sun; his clothing became like light; Moses and Elijah were seen speaking with him; a shining cloud came over the disciples; and from the cloud a voice was heard saying, "This is my beloved Son. Hear him" (<a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>).
<p>I have been taught that in this instance the Lord represented the Word. His face shining like the sun represented the divine goodness of his divine love. The clothes that became like the light represented the divine truth of his divine wisdom. Moses and Elijah represented the historical Word and the prophetic Word. Moses represented the Word that was written through him, and the historical Word in general. Elijah represented the whole prophetic Word. The shining cloud that covered the disciples represented the Word in its literal meaning. That is why a voice was heard coming from the cloud saying, "This is my beloved Son. Hear him. "
<p>All communications and answers from heaven come solely through outermost things like those in the Word's literal meaning. The Lord communicates in a complete way. </p>

222. (vi) THE WORD IN ITS GLORY WAS REPRESENTED IN THE LORD AT HIS TRANSFIGURATION.<p>We read about the Lord's transfiguration in the presence of Peter, James and John that His face shone like the sun, His clothes became like light, and Moses and Elijah were seen speaking with Him; a shining cloud overshadowed the disciples, and a voice was heard from the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son, listen to Him (<a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>).<p>I have been taught that the Lord then represented the Word. His face, which shone like the sun, represented the Divine good of His Divine love; His clothes, which became like light, the Divine truth of His Divine wisdom. Moses and Elijah represented the historical and prophetic sections of the Word; Moses the part of the Word written by his instrumentality and the historical parts as a whole, Elijah the whole of the prophetic part of the Word. The shining cloud which overshadowed the disciples represented the Word in its literal sense; that is why a voice was heard from it saying, 'This is my beloved Son, listen to Him'. For all statements and replies given from heaven are only given through the outermost forms, such as is the literal sense of the Word; they acquire their fulness from the Lord. </p>

222. (6) The Word in its glory was represented in the Lord when He was transfigured. Of the Lord when transfigured before Peter, James, and John we read: <p>That His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as the light, and that Moses and Elias were seen talking with Him; and that a bright cloud overshadowed the disciples, and a voice was heard from the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him (<a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>). <p>I have been told that the Lord then represented the Word His "face" which "shone like the sun," represented the Divine good of His Divine love; His "garments" which "became as the light," represented the Divine truth of His Divine wisdom; "Moses and Elias" the historic and prophetic Word, "Moses" the Word written through him, and in general the historic Word, and "Elias" the whole prophetic Word; the "bright cloud" which "overshadowed the disciples" represented the Word in the sense of the letter; so from it a voice was heard, saying, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him," for no announcements or responses are ever made from heaven except through outmosts such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word, for they are made by the Lord in fullness. </p>

222. (6) THE WORD IN ITS GLORY WAS REPRESENTED IN THE LORD, WHEN HE WAS TRANSFIGURED.<p>Concerning the Lord's Transfiguration before Peter, James and John, it is said:<p>that "His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment became like light; and there appeared Moses and Elias talking with Him. A bright cloud overshadowed the disciples, and a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying This is my beloved Son... hear ye Him" <a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>.<p>I have been informed that the Lord on this occasion represented the Word. His face, which shone as the sun, represented the Divine Good of His Divine Love; and His raiment, which became like light, the Divine Truth of His Divine Wisdom. Moses and Elias represented the historical and the prophetical Word; Moses, the Word written by him, and in general the historical Word; and Elias, the whole prophetical Word. The bright cloud, which overshadowed the disciples, represented the Word in the sense of the Letter. Therefore out of this cloud a voice was heard, saying, "This is my beloved Son... hear ye Him," as all declarations and responses from heaven are only made by means of ultimates, such as are in the sense of the Letter of the Word; for they are made in fulness from the Lord. </p>

222. VI. QUOD VERBUM IN SUA GLORIA REPRAESENTATUM SIT IN DOMINO, CUM TRANSFORMATUS EST. De Domino coram Petro, Jacobo et Johanne, transformato legitur, Quod Facies Ipsius fulserit sicut Sol; Vestimenta Ipsius facta sint sicut Lux: et quod visi sint Moses et Elias cum Ipso loquentes: et quod Nubes lucida Discipulos obtexerit: et quod ex Nube audita sit vox, dicens, Hic est Filius meus dilectus, Ipsum audite, <a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthaeus 17:1-5</a>. Instructus sum, quod Dominus tunc repraesentaverit Verbum; per Faciem, quae fulsit sicut Sol, repraesentatum est Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Ipsius; per Vestimenta, quae facta sicut Lux, Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae Ipsius; per Mosen et Eliam, Verbum Historicum et Propheticum, per Mosen Verbum quod per illum scriptum est, et in genere Verbum Historicum, et per Eliam omne Verbum Propheticum; per Nubem lucidam, quae obtexit Discipulos, Verbum in Sensu literae; quare ex hac Vox audita est, dicens, Hic est Filius meus dilectus, Ipsum audite: omnia enim Enuntiata et Responsa e Coelo, nusquam fiunt nisi per Ultima, qualia sunt in Sensu literae Verbi; fiunt enim in pleno a Domino. </p>
