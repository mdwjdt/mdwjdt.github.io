698. Chapter 13: The Holy Supper
<p>Without Knowing about the Correspondences of Physical Things with Spiritual Things, No One Can Know the Functions and Benefits of the Holy Supper
<p>The assertion in this heading has already been partly explained in the chapter on baptism, where the point was made that without knowing that the Word has a spiritual meaning, no one can know what the two sacraments - baptism and the Holy Supper - entail and what they do for us (667-669). The heading just above says "without knowing about the correspondences of physical things with spiritual things"; this is the same thing, because correspondences turn the earthly meaning of the Word into a spiritual meaning in heaven. As a result, these two layers of meaning correspond to each other. Someone who knows correspondences, then, is in a position to know the spiritual meaning of the Word.
<p>For a further definition and description of correspondences, see the chapter on Sacred Scripture from beginning to end [189-281]. See also the exposition of the Ten Commandments from first to last [282-335], and the individual correspondences that are explained throughout Revelation Unveiled. </p>

698. CHAPTER THIRTEEN. THE HOLY SUPPER.<p>I. No one who does not know about the way natural things correspond with spiritual ones can know the benefits conferred by the Holy Supper.<p>A partial explanation of this was given in the chapter on baptism, where it was shown that without a knowledge of the spiritual sense of the Word it is impossible to know what is involved in and effected by the two sacraments, baptism and the Holy Supper (<a href="667.htm">667-669</a>). Here we say 'who does not know about the way natural things correspond with spiritual ones'; this is the same, because the natural sense of the Word is turned into the spiritual one by means of correspondences in heaven. That is why those two senses correspond to each other, so that anyone who knows the correspondences can know the spiritual sense. What correspondences are and what is their nature can be seen in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture from beginning to end,- also in the explanation of the Ten Commandments from the first to the last, and in detail in Apocalypse Revealed. </p>

698. CHAPTER 13 <p>THE HOLY SUPPER. <p>I. WITHOUT SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE CORRESPONDENCES OF NATURAL WITH SPIRITUAL THINGS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT THE USES AND BENEFITS OF THE HOLY SUPPER ARE. <p>This has been partially explained in the chapter on Baptism, where it was shown that without a knowledge of the spiritual sense of the Word it cannot be known what the two sacraments, baptism and the holy supper, involve and effect (see n. <a href="667.htm">667-669</a>). It is now said, without some knowledge of the correspondences of natural with spiritual things, which is the same thing, since by means of correspondences the natural sense of the Word is changed into a spiritual sense in heaven; and because of this these two senses are mutually correspondent; therefore he who has a knowledge of correspondences is able to understand the spiritual sense. But what correspondences are, and the nature of them, can be seen in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture from beginning to end; also in the explanation of the Decalogue from the first to the last commandment, and particularly in the Apocalypse Revealed. </p>

<p>
698. CHAPTER XIII<p>THE HOLY SUPPER<p>I. WITHOUT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CORRESPONDENCES OF NATURAL WITH SPIRITUAL THINGS, NO ONE CAN KNOW THE USES AND BENEFITS OF THE HOLY SUPPER.<p>This was in part explained in the chapter on Baptism, where it was shown that "without a knowledge of the spiritual sense of the Word, it is impossible to know what the two sacraments, Baptism and the Holy Supper, involve and effect." This may be seen in <a href="667.htm">667-669</a>. Here it is said "without a knowledge of the correspondences of natural with spiritual things;" this is the same thing, because by correspondences the natural sense of the Word is changed into the spiritual sense in heaven. Hence it is that those two senses correspond to each other; and, therefore, whoever is acquainted with correspondences, may know the spiritual sense. What correspondences are, and their nature, may be seen in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, from the beginning to the end; and also in the explanation of the Decalogue, from the first commandment to the last; and particularly in the Apocalypse Revealed. </p>

698. CAPUT DECIMUM TERTIMUM<p>DE SANCTA COENA.<p>Quod absque notitia de Correspondentiis naturalium cum spiritualibus nemo scire possit usus fructus Sanctae Coenae.<p>Haec quoad partem explicata sunt in Capite de BAPTISMO, ubi ostensum est, Quod absque cognitione de Sensu spirituali Verbi, non possit sciri, quid duo Sacramenta, Baptismus et Sancta Coena, involvunt et efficiunt, quae videantur: <a href="667.htm">667-669</a>. Hic dicitur, quod absque notitia de Correspondentiis naturalium cum spiritualibus, quod idem est, quia Sensus naturalis Verbi vertitur in spiritualem per Correspondentias in Coelo; inde est, quod duo illi Sensus sibi mutuo correspondeant, quare qui novit Correspondentias, nosse potest Sensum spiritualem. Quid vero et quales Correspondentiae sunt, videri potest in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA a principio ad finem, et quoque in EXPLICATIONE DECALOGI a primo Praecepto ad ultimum, et singulariter in APOCALYPSI REVELATA. </p>
