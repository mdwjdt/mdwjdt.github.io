<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第342节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>342</b>.前面（336－339节）说明了得救之信在于主神，救主耶稣基督。但问题来了，信祂的第一个原则什么呢？答案是：承认祂是神的儿子。这就是主降世时所揭示和宣布的第一个原则。因为若非人首先承认祂是神的儿子，因而是从神发出的神，那祂本人、及其在祂之后的使徒们传扬要信祂等于白费口舌。如今的情形有点类似，那些出于自我，即仅仅从外在人或属世人思考的人心里会说：“耶和华神如何生出儿子，一个人如何又是神？”因此，有必要以圣言来证实这信仰的第一个原则。为此，现引用以下经文：<br />天使对玛利亚说，你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。祂要为大，称为至高者的儿子。马利亚对天使说，我没有出嫁，怎么有这事呢？天使回答说，圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你；因此所要生的圣者，必称为神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.31.htm">路加福音1:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.32.htm">32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.34.htm">34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">35</a>）。<br />当耶稣正受洗时，有声音从天上来，说，这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.16.htm">马太福音3:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.10.htm">马可福音1:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.21.htm">路加福音3:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.22.htm">22</a>）<br />当耶稣变像时，又有声音从天上来，说，这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的，你们要听祂。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.5.htm">马太福音17:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.7.htm">马可福音9:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.35.htm">路加福音9:35</a>）<br />耶稣问祂的门徒，人说我是谁？彼得回答，祢是基督，永生神的儿子。耶稣说，巴约拿的儿子西门，你是有福的！我告诉你，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.13.htm">马太福音16:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.16.htm">16</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">18</a>）<br />主说，祂要把祂的教会建在这磐石之上，也就是说，建在“祂是神的儿子”这一真理和承认之上。因为“磐石”表示真理，还表示涉及神性真理的主。所以，凡不承认“祂是神的儿子”这一真理所在之处，教会是不存在的。这就是为何前面说，这是信耶稣基督的第一个原则，因而是信的真正源头。<br />施洗约翰看出并见证耶稣是神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.34.htm">约翰福音1:34</a>）<br />门徒拿但业对耶稣说，祢是神的儿子，祢是以色列的王。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.49.htm">约翰福音1:49</a>）<br />十二个门徒说，我们相信祢是基督，永生神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.69.htm">约翰福音6:69</a>）<br />祂被称为神的独生子，父怀里的独生子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">约翰福音1:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">3:16</a>）<br />耶稣自己在大祭司面前承认祂是神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.63.htm">马太福音26:63</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.43.htm">27:43</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.61.htm">马可福音14:61</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.62.htm">62</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.70.htm">路加福音22:70</a>）<br />那些在船上的人前来拜耶稣，说，祢真是神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太14.33.htm">马太福音14:33</a>）那位想受洗的太监对腓利说，我信耶稣基督是神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒8.37.htm">使徒行传8:37</a>）<br />保罗转变信仰后，传讲耶稣是神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒9.20.htm">使徒行传9:20</a>）<br />耶稣说，时候将到，死人要听见神儿子的声音，听见的人就要活了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.25.htm">约翰福音5:25</a>）<br />不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信神独生子的名。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">约翰福音3:18</a>）但记这些事要叫你们信耶稣是基督，是神的儿子，并且叫你们信了祂，就可以因祂的名得生命。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">约翰福音20:31</a>）<br />我将这些话写给你们信奉神儿子之名的人，要叫你们知道自己有永生，信奉神儿子的名。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.13.htm">约翰一书5:13</a>）<br />我们知道，神的儿子已经来到，且将智慧赐给我们，使我们认识那位真实的；我们也在那位真实的里面，就是在祂儿子耶稣基督里面。祂是真神，也是永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.20.htm">约翰一书5:20</a>）<br />凡认耶稣是神的儿子，神就住在祂里面，他也住在神里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹4.15.htm">约翰一书4:15</a>）<br />别的地方也有（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.29.htm">如马太福音8:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.40.htm">27:40</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.43.htm">43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.54.htm">54</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.1.htm">马可福音1:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.11.htm">3:11</a>；<a

href="http://39-27.cn/林后1.19.htm">哥林多后书1:19</a>；加拉太书20；<a href="http://39-27.cn/弗4.13.htm">以弗所书4:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/来4.14.htm">希伯来书4:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/来6.6.htm">6:6</a>；<a

href="http://39-27.cn/启2.18.htm">启示录2:18</a>）。<br />还有许多地方，耶和华称耶稣为祂的儿子，耶稣称耶和华神为祂的父，如：<br />父所作的事，子也照样作；父怎样叫死人起来，使他们活着，子也照样随自己的意思使人活着。叫人都尊敬子如同尊敬父一样。父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给他儿子也照样在自己有生命。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.19.htm">约翰福音5:19</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.27.htm">27</a>）<br />还有很多其它例子；在大卫的诗篇中：<br />我要传圣旨。耶和华曾对我说：“你是我的儿子，我今日生你。当以嘴亲子，恐怕他发怒，你们便在道中灭亡。因为他的怒气快要发作。凡投靠他的，都是有福的，（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.7.htm">诗篇2:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.12.htm">12</a>）。<br />从上述经文可以得出以下结论：凡想成为真正的基督徒并被基督拯救之人，都当信耶稣是永生神的儿子。凡不信这一点，而只信祂是玛利亚的儿子之人，会在他们的脑中种下关于祂的各样观念，都是些用来诅咒和摧毁救赎的观念（对此，参看90，94，102节）。这类人会说出犹太人那样的话：<br />他们用荆棘编的冠冕取代王冠，戴在祂的头上，还给醋给祂喝，并大叫，如果你是神的儿子，就从十字架上下来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.29.htm">马太福音27:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.34.htm">34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.40.htm">40</a>）<br />或如魔鬼撒旦说：<br />如果你是神的儿子，可以吩咐这些石头变成食物，或如果你是神的儿子，可以跳下去。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.3.htm">马太福音4:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这种人亵渎主的教会和圣殿，使其成为贼窝。敬拜主如同敬拜穆罕默德，不将真正的基督教（即对主的敬拜）与自然主义区别开来者就是这些人。他们好比一些人驾着马车行驶在薄冰上，冰面破裂，他们掉进窟窿，他们以及他们的马和马车都淹没在冰水中。他们还好比一些人用蒲草和芦苇编织一艘船，涂上沥青将其粘合起来，然后坐上船驶向大海，但柏油的粘性被破坏，他们被海水呛到、淹没，最终葬身海底。</p>

<p>
342. 在先前的<a href="336.htm">336-339</a>節說明了得救之信在於主上帝我們的拯救者耶穌基督。問題是, 到達此信的第一步是什麼呢？答案是:承認祂是上帝之子。這也是在祂降世時所揭示和宣佈的。倘若人沒有承認祂是上帝之子, 因此祂從上帝而出, 那麼對祂,以及後來對他的使徒們來說, 去傳揚當信祂就變得毫無意義了。
<p>當今的情形類似如此, 那些凡思考皆從自我出發,並且僅僅出自外在或屬世之自我, 會自言自語:"耶和華上帝如何生子, 一個人如何又是上帝？"因此, 有必要以聖言來證實這是信仰的第一步; 為此, 引用以下內容作為證明:
<p>天人對瑪利亞說:"你要懷孕生子, 可以給他起名叫耶穌。祂要為大, 稱為至高者的兒子。"馬利亞對天人說:"我沒有出嫁, 怎麼有這事呢？"天人回答說:"聖靈要臨到你身上, 至高者的能力要蔭庇你; 因此所要生的聖者, 必稱為上帝的兒子(<a href="3927/luke_1_31.htm">路加福音1:31-32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">34-35</a>)。"當耶穌正受洗時, 有聲音從天上來, 說:"這是我的愛子, 我所喜悅的"(<a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">馬太福音3:16</a>;<a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">馬可福音1:10-11</a>;<a href="3927/luke_3_21.htm">路加福音3:21-22</a>)。當耶穌變像時, 又有聲音從天上來, 說:"這是我的愛子, 我所喜悅的, 你們要聽祂"(<a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">馬太福音17:5</a>;<a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">馬可福音9:7</a>;<a href="3927/luke_9_35.htm">路加福音9:35</a>)。[2]耶穌問祂的門徒:"人說我是誰？"彼得回答:"禰是基督, 永生上帝的兒子。"耶穌說:"約拿的兒子西門, 你是有福的！我告訴你, 我要把教會建造在這磐石上"(<a href="3927/matthew_16_13.htm">馬太福音16:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">16-18</a>)。
<p>主說, 祂要把祂的教會建立在這磐石之上, 也就是說, 在"祂是上帝之子"這個真理之上。事實上, "磐石"表示真理, 還表示主的神性真理。教會不會建立在任何不承認耶穌是上帝之子這個真理之人的裡面。這就是為何我先前說, 這是信耶穌基督的第一步, 這是信的開端。
<p>施洗約翰看出並見證耶穌是上帝的兒子(<a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">約翰福音1:34</a>)。門徒拿但業對耶穌說:"禰是上帝的兒子, 禰是以色列的王"(<a href="3927/john_1_49.htm">約翰福音1:49</a>)。十二個門徒說:"我們相信禰是基督, 永生上帝的兒子"(<a href="3927/john_6_69.htm">約翰福音6:69</a>)。祂被稱為上帝的獨生子, 父懷裡的獨生子(<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">約翰福音1:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>)。耶穌在大祭司面前承認祂是上帝之子(<a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">馬太福音26:63</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_27_43.htm">27:43</a>;<a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">馬可福音14:61-62</a>;<a href="3927/luke_22_70.htm">路加福音22:70</a>)。那些在船上的人前來拜耶穌, 說:"禰真是上帝的兒子"(<a href="3927/matthew_14_33.htm">馬太福音14:33</a>)。那位想受洗的太監對腓利說:"我信耶穌基督是上帝的兒子"(<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_8_37.htm">使徒行傳8:37</a>)。保羅轉變信仰後, 宣傳耶穌, 說祂是上帝的兒子(<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_9_20.htm">使徒行傳9:20</a>)。耶穌說:"時候將到, 死人要聽見上帝之子的聲音, 聽見的人就要活了"(<a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">約翰福音5:25</a>)。不信的人, 罪已經定了, 因為他不信上帝獨生子的名(<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">約翰福音3:18</a>)。但記這些事要叫你們信耶穌是基督, 是上帝的兒子, 並且叫你們信了祂, 就可以因祂的名得生命(<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">約翰福音20:31</a>)。我將這些話寫給你們信奉上帝兒子之名的人, 要叫你們知道自己有永生(<a href="3927/john_5_13.htm">約翰福音5:13</a>)。我們知道, 上帝的兒子已經來到, 且將智慧賜給我們, 使我們認識那位真實的, 我們也在那位真實的裡面, 就是在祂兒子耶穌基督裡面。這是真上帝, 也是永生(<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>)。凡認耶穌為上帝之子的, 上帝就住在祂裡面, 祂也住在上帝裡面(<a href="3927/john_4_15.htm">約翰福音4:15</a>)。還有, 例如<a href="3927/matthew_8_29.htm">馬太福音8:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_27_40.htm">27:40</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_43.htm">43</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_54.htm">54</a>;<a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">馬可福音1:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/mark_3_11.htm">3:11</a>; <a href="3927/mark_15_39.htm">15:39</a>;<a href="3927/luke_8_28.htm">路加福音8:28</a>;
<p><a href="3927/john_9_35.htm">約翰福音9:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_10_36.htm">10:36</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_4.htm">11:4</a>, <a href="3927/john_11_27.htm">27</a>; <a href="3927/john_19_7.htm">19:7</a>;<a href="3927/romans_1_4.htm">羅馬書1:4</a>; <a href="3927/2-corinthians_1_19.htm">哥林多後書1:19</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_2_20.htm">加拉太書2:20</a>; <a href="3927/ephesians_4_13.htm">以弗所書4:13</a>; <a href="3927/hebrews_4_14.htm">希伯來書4:14</a>; <a href="3927/hebrews_6_6.htm">6:6</a>; <a href="3927/hebrews_7_3.htm">7:3</a>; <a href="3927/hebrews_10_29.htm">10:29</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_8.htm">約翰福音3:8</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_10.htm">5:10</a>;<a href="3927/revelation_2_18.htm">啟示錄2:18</a>)。
<p>還有許多地方, 耶和華稱耶穌為祂的兒子, 耶穌稱耶和華上帝為祂的父, 正如:"父所作的事, 子也照樣作。父怎樣叫死人起來, 使他們活著, 子也照樣隨自己的意思使人活著。叫人都尊敬子如同尊敬父一樣。父怎樣在自己有生命, 就賜給他兒子也照樣在自己有生命" (<a href="3927/john_5_19.htm">約翰福音5:19-27</a>)。還有其它許多例子, 在大衛的『詩篇』中:"我要傳聖旨。耶和華曾對我說:'你是我的兒子, 我今日生你。當以嘴親子, 恐怕他發怒, 你們便在道中滅亡, 因為他的怒氣快要發作。凡投靠他的, 都是有福的"(<a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">詩篇2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>)。
<p>[3]以這些章節為基礎, 我們可以得出結論:所有想成為真正基督徒並被基督拯救之人都當信耶穌是永生上帝之子。
<p>無論哪個, 若不信這一點, 而只信祂是瑪利亞的兒子, 在他們的腦中會種下關於祂的各樣觀念, 用來詛咒和摧毀拯救的觀念(參閱<a href="90.htm">90</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="102.htm">102</a>節)。這類人會說出猶太人那樣的話, 他們用荊棘編的冠冕取代王冠, 戴在祂的頭上; 還給醋給祂喝, 並大叫:"如果你是上帝的兒子, 就從十字架上下來"(<a href="3927/matthew_27_29.htm">馬太福音27:29</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_40.htm">40</a>)。或者會說出魔鬼試探耶穌的話:"如果你是上帝的兒子, 可以吩咐這些石頭變成食物", 或者"如果你是上帝的兒子, 可以跳下去"(<a href="3927/matthew_4_3.htm">馬太福音4:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_4_6.htm">6</a>)。
<p>這些人褻瀆主的教會和聖殿, 令其成為賊窩。這些人敬拜主如同崇拜穆罕默德, 分不清真正的基督教(就是敬拜主的教會)與自然崇拜的分別。他們好比一些人在冰面駕乘馬車, 冰面破裂, 他們掉進窟窿, 冰水淹沒他們,馬和馬車。他們還好比一些人用蒲草和蘆葦編織一艘船, 用柏油粘合成型, 坐上船駛上廣闊的大海。但是, 柏油的粘合逐漸松脫, 他們被海水淹沒吞噬, 海底成了他們的墳墓。 </p>

<h4 align="center">True Christianity #342 (Rose, 2010)
</h4>
<p>
342. The preceding part of this chapter (337-339) showed that the faith that saves us is faith in the Lord God our Savior Jesus Christ. The question is, what is the first step toward faith in him? The answer is acknowledging that he is the Son of God. This was the first step toward faith that the Lord revealed and proclaimed when he came into the world. If people had not started by acknowledging that he was the Son of God, and therefore God from God, it would have been pointless for him, and later for his apostles, to have preached faith in him.
<p>There is in fact something like this today among people whose thoughts are based on their own self-importance, that is, on their outer, earthly selves alone. They say to themselves, "How could Jehovah God conceive a son? How could a human being be God?" Therefore it is necessary to use the Word to establish and support this first step into faith; the following passages are offered for this purpose:
<p>"The angel said to Mary, 'You will conceive in your womb and give birth, and you will call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest. ' And Mary said to the angel, 'How will this take place, since I have not had intercourse?' The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will cover you; therefore the Holy One that is born from you will be called the Son of God'" (<a href="3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">34-35</a>). When Jesus was baptized, a voice came from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (<a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_21.htm">Luke 3:21-22</a>). Furthermore, when Jesus was transfigured, a voice came from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear him" (<a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] "Jesus asked his disciples, 'Who do people say I am?' Peter answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. ' Jesus said, 'You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah. I say to you, on this rock I will build my church'" (<a href="3927/matthew_16_13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">16-18</a>).
<p>The Lord said, then, that he would build his church on this rock, that is, on the truth and the confession that he is the Son of God. In fact, a "rock" means a truth, and also the Lord's divine truth. The church does not exist in someone who does not confess the truth that Jesus is the Son of God. That is why I said just above that this is the first step into faith in Jesus Christ - this is faith at its very outset.
<p>John the Baptist saw and testified that Jesus is the Son of God (<a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">John 1:34</a>). The disciple Nathaniel said to Jesus, "You are the Son of God.

The twelve disciples said, "We have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (<a href="3927/john_6_69.htm">John 6:69</a>). Jesus is called the only begotten Son of God and the only begotten from the Father, who is close to the Father's heart (<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>).

"Those who were in the boat came and worshiped Jesus saying, 'Truly you are the Son of God'" (<a href="3927/matthew_14_33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>). The eunuch who wanted to be baptized said to Philip, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God" (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_8_37.htm">Acts of the Apostles 8:37</a>). After Paul was converted, he preached that "Jesus is the Son of God" (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_9_20.htm">Acts of the Apostles 9:20</a>). Jesus said, "The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (<a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>). "Those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God" (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). "These things have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by believing may have life in his name" (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>). "I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life and so that you may believe in the name of the Son of God" (<a href="3927/1-john_5_13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>). "We know that the Son of God came and enabled us to know the truth. We are in the truth in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life" (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). "If any confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God" (<a href="3927/1-john_4_15.htm">1 John 4:15</a>).

As the Father raises the dead and brings them to life, so does the Son. As the Father has life in himself, so he has given the Son to have life in himself, therefore all should honor the Son as they honor the Father" (<a href="3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19-27</a>). This also happens in many other passages, including David: "I will announce this decision: Jehovah said to me, 'You are my Son. Today I fathered you. ' Kiss the Son or he will be angry and you will perish on the way because he will flare up with his brief anger. Blessed are all those who trust in him" (<a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">Psalms 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] On the basis of these passages, we can now draw the conclusion that everyone who wants to be a true Christian and be saved by Christ has to believe that Jesus is the Son of the living God.
<p>Those who do not believe this and think of Jesus as only the Son of Mary implant in themselves various ideas about him that are damaging and destructive to their salvation (see above, 90, 94, 102). One could say the same thing about them as about the Jews - instead of a royal crown, they put a crown of thorns on Jesus' head, give him vinegar to drink, and shout, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross" [see <a href="3927/matthew_27_40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>]. Or else they say what the devil who tempted him said: "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread," or, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down [from the Temple roof]" (<a href="3927/matthew_4_3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_4_6.htm">6</a>).
<p>People like this desecrate the Lord's church and his house of worship. They make it a den of thieves. They are the people who turn devotion to the Lord into something like devotion to Muhammad. They do not distinguish between true Christianity, which is worship of the Lord, and materialist philosophy. They could be compared to people riding in a carriage or a wagon on thin ice, and the ice breaks under them, and they sink, and they and their horses and carriage disappear into the icy water. They could also be compared to people who weave a life raft out of rushes and reeds, using tar to glue it together; and they set out onto the great expanse of the ocean, but out there the tar glue dissolves; and choked by the brine, they are swallowed up and buried in the depths of the sea. </p>

342. The previous section (<a href="336.htm">336-339</a>) showed that saving faith is in the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ. But the question may be raised, what is the leading point of faith in Him? The answer is that it is acknowledgment that He is the Son of God. This was the leading point of faith which the Lord revealed and announced, when He came into the world. For if people had not first acknowledged that He was the Son of God, thus God proceeding from God, He Himself, and afterwards the Apostles, would in vain have preached faith in Him. Now because the situation at the present day is similar, but in the case of those who think from the self, that is, only from the external or natural man, saying to themselves, 'How can Jehovah God beget a son, and how can a man be God?', this leading point of faith must be proved and established from the Word. I shall quote therefore the following passages:<p>The angel said to Mary, You will conceive in your womb and give birth [to a son], and you are to give him the name of Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. And Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I have no knowledge of a man? The angel replied, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so that the holy thing that is born of you will be called the Son of God, <a href="3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">34-35</a>.<p>When Jesus was being baptised, a voice came from heaven, saying, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased, <a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_21.htm">Luke 3:21-22</a>.<p>Then when Jesus was transfigured, again a voice came from heaven which said, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased, listen to him, <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Jesus asked his disciples, Who do men say I am? Peter replied, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus said, Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah. I tell you, on this rock I shall build my church, <a href="3927/matthew_16_13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">16-18</a>.<p>The Lord said that He would build His church on this rock, that is to say, on this truth and admission, that He was the Son of God. For rock means truth, and also the Lord in His capacity as Divine truth. Therefore where anyone fails to admit this truth, that He is the Son of God, the church is not present. That is why it was stated above that this is the leading point of faith in Jesus Christ, and so the true source of faith.<p>John the Baptist saw and bore witness that He is <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">John 1:34</a>.<p>Nathanael the disciple said to Jesus, You are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel, <a href="3927/john_1_49.htm">John 1:49</a>.<p>The twelve disciples said, We believe that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God, <a href="3927/john_6_69.htm">John 6:69</a>.<p>He is called the only-begotten Son of God, the only-begotten of the Father, who is in the Father's bosom, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>.<p>Jesus Himself admitted before the High Priest that He was the Son of God, <a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_27_43.htm">27:43</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">Mark 14:61-62</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_70.htm">Luke 22:70</a>.<p>Those who were in the boat came and worshipped Jesus, saying, Truly, you are the Son of God, <a href="3927/matthew_14_33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>.<p>The eunuch who wished to be baptised said to Philip, I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_8_37.htm">Acts of the Apostles 8:37</a>.<p>Paul after his conversion preached Christ <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

Jehovah said to me, You are my son, today have I begotten you. Kiss the son, so that he may not be angry and so that you do not perish on the way. For in a short while his wrath will blaze up; blessed are all who trust in him, <a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">Psalms 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] These passages now permit the conclusion that everyone who wishes to be a true Christian and to be saved by Christ should believe that Jesus is the Son of the living God. Anyone who does not believe this, but only that He is the son of Mary, is implanting in his mind various ideas about Him which are damning and destructive of his salvation; see above on this (92, 94, 102). Much the same might be said of these people as of the Jews, that in place of a King's crown they put on His head a crown of thorns; and also that they give Him vinegar to drink and cry, 'If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross' [<a href="3927/matthew_27_29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_40.htm">40</a>]. Or as the devil said tempting Him, 'If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread' or 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down' (<a href="3927/matthew_4_3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_4_6.htm">6</a>). These people profane His church and temple, and make it a robbers' cave. These are those who make His worship like the cult of Mohammed, and do not distinguish between true Christianity, which is the worship of the Lord, and nature-worship. They can be likened to people riding in a carriage or a trap over thin ice, when the ice breaks beneath them and they are drowned, as freezing water closes over them, the horses and the carriage. They can also be likened to those who fashion a boat out of rushes and reeds, and glue it with pitch to make it hold together, and entrust themselves to it on the open sea; but the pitch that holds it together comes unstuck, and they are drowned and swallowed up in sea-water, and find their grave in its depths.<p>

342. In the preceding section (n. <a href="336.htm">336-339</a>), it is shown than saving faith is faith in the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ. But the question arises, What is the first principle of faith in Him? The answer is, The acknowledgement that He is the Son of God. This was the first principle of faith, which the Lord revealed and announced when He came into the world. For unless men had first acknowledged that He was the Son of God, and thus God from God, in vain would He Himself and His Apostles after Him have preached faith in Him. Now as the case is somewhat similar at the present day - but with those who think from their selfhood, that is, solely from the external or natural man, saying to themselves, How could Jehovah God beget a Son, and how can a man be God? - it is necessary to confirm and establish from the Word this first principle of faith. For this reason the following passages are quoted: <p>The angel said to Mary, Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee therefore that which is to be born of thee shall be called Holy, the Son of God (<a href="3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-35</a>) <p>When Jesus was being baptized, there came a voice out of heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (<a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_21.htm">Luke 3:21, 22</a>). <p>Again when Jesus was transfigured, there also came a voice out of heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him (<a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>).

[2] Jesus asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that I am? Peter answered, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus said, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah. I say unto thee, that upon this rock I will build my church (<a href="3927/matthew_16_13.htm">Matthew 16:13-18</a>). <p>The Lord said that upon this rock, that is, upon the truth and the confession that He is the Son of God, He would build His church; for "rock" signifies truth, and also the Lord in respect to Divine truth. So with those who do not confess this truth that He is the Son of God, the church is not; therefore it is said above, that this is the first principle of faith in Jesus Christ, and thus is faith in its origin. <p>John the Baptist saw and bare witness that this is the Son of God (<a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">John 1:34</a>). <p>The disciple Nathanael said to Jesus, Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel (<a href="3927/john_1_49.htm">John 1:49</a>). <p>The twelve disciples said, We have believed that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God (<a href="3927/john_6_69.htm">John 6:69</a>). <p>He is called the only begotten Son of God, and the only begotten from the Father, who is in the bosom of the Father (<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>). <p>Jesus Himself confessed before the high priest, that He was the Son of God (<a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63, 64</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_27_43.htm">27:43</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">Mark 14:61, 62</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_70.htm">Luke 22:70</a>). <p>They that were in the ship came and worshiped Jesus, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God (<a href="3927/matthew_14_33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>). <p>The eunuch who wished to be baptized, said to Philip, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_8_37.htm">Acts of the Apostles 3:37</a>). <p>Paul, when he was converted, preached Christ, that He was the Son of God (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_9_20.htm">Acts of the Apostles 9:20</a>). <p>Jesus said, The hour cometh, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live (<a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>). <p>He that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). <p>These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in His name (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>). <p>These things have I written unto you who believe in the name of the Son of God that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God (<a href="3927/1-john_5_13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>). <p>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given that we may know Him that is True, and we are in Him that is True, in His Son Jesus Christ.

[3] From the foregoing now comes this conclusion, that everyone who wishes to be truly a Christian and to be saved by Christ, ought to believe that Jesus is the Son of the living God. He who does not believe this, but only that He is the Son of Mary, implants in his mind various ideas respecting Him, which are injurious and destructive to that salvation (On which see above,<a href="92.htm">92</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="102.htm">102</a>). Of such it may be said, as of the Jews, that instead of a royal crown, they place upon His head a crown of thorns, and also give Him vinegar to drink, and they cry out, If thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross (<a href="3927/matthew_27_29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_40.htm">40</a>). <p>Or as the devil, the tempter, said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread or, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down (<a href="3927/matthew_4_3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_4_6.htm">6</a>). <p>Such profane His church and temple, and make it a den of robbers. These are they who make the worship of Him like the worship of Mohammed, and do not distinguish between true Christianity, which is the worship of the Lord, and naturalism. They may be compared to men riding in a carriage or coach over thin ice, and the ice breaks under them, and they sink, and they, with their horses and vehicle, are covered by the icy water. They may also be likened to men who make a little boat of woven reeds and rushes, daubing it with pitch that it may hold together, and in it put out to sea; but there the cohesiveness of the pitch is destroyed, and they are choked by the waters of the sea and swallowed up and are buried in its depths. </p>

342. In the preceding proposition, <a href="337.htm">337-339</a>, it was shown that a saving faith is a faith in the Lord God, the Savior Jesus Christ. It may be asked, however, what is the first principle of a faith in Him? The answer is: It is the acknowledgment that He is the Son of God. This was the first principle of faith which the Lord, when He came into the world, revealed and announced. For unless men had first acknowledged that He was the Son of God, and thus God from God, in vain would He Himself and His apostles after Him have preached faith in Him. A somewhat similar situation arise to-day; but with men who think from their proprium, that is, from the external or natural man only. They say within themselves, "How can Jehovah God conceive a Son, and how can man be God?"<p>Thus it is necessary that this first principle of faith should be confirmed and established from the Word, and therefore the following passages are adduced from it.<p>The angel said to Mary, "Thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth [a Son], and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest... Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered... The HOLY SPIRIT shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" <a href="3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">34-35</a>.<p>When Jesus was being baptized there came a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." <a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_21.htm">Luke 3:21-22</a>.<p>So again, when Jesus was transfigured, a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him" <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do men say that I am?" Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus... said... "Blessed are thou, Simon, son of Jones (A.V., Bar-Jona)... I say unto thee... upon this rock I will build my Church" <a href="3927/matthew_16_13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">16-18</a>.<p>The Lord said that upon this rock He would build His Church, that is, on the truth and confession that He is the Son of God; for rock signifies truth, and also the Lord as to Divine Truth. Therefore the Church does not exist in any one who does not confess this truth that He is the Son of God; and for this reason it was said above that this is the first principle of faith in Jesus Christ, and consequently faith in its origin.<p>John the Baptist "saw, and bare record that He is the Son of God" <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">John 1:34</a>.<p>Nathaniel, the disciple, said to Jesus, "Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel" <a href="3927/john_1_49.htm">John 1:49</a>.<p>The twelve disciples said, "We believe... that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" <a href="3927/john_6_69.htm">John 6:69</a>.<p>He is called the only begotten Son of God, the only begotten of the Father, "which is in the bosom of the Father" <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">3:16</a>.<p>Jesus Himself confessed before the High Priest that He was the Son of God. <a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_27_43.htm">27:43</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">Mark 14:61-62</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_70.htm">Luke 22:70</a>.<p>Those who were in the ship came and worshiped Jesus, saying, "Of a truth thou art the Son of God" <a href="3927/matthew_14_33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>.<p>The eunuch who desired to be baptized, said to Philip, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_8_37.htm">Acts 8:37</a>.<p>Paul, after his conversion, preached Jesus, 'that He was the Son of God' <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_9_20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>.<p>Jesus said, "The hour is coming... when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live" <a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>.<p>"He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God" <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>"These things are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing ye might have life through His name" <a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>.<p>"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God" <a href="3927/1-john_5_13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>.<p>"We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us to know Him that is true (A.V., an understanding that we may know Him that is true); and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ.

<p>
[3] From these passages this conclusion is reached, that every one who desires to be truly a Christian, and to be saved by Christ, ought to believe that Jesus is the Son of the living God. He who does not believe this, but who only believes that he is the son of Mary, implants in his mind various ideas concerning Him that are hurtful, and destructive of that salvation, as may be seen above in <a href="92.htm">92</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="102.htm">102</a>.

and make no distinction between true Christianity, which is the worship of the Lord, and naturalism. They may be likened to persons traveling by car or coach over thin ice, which breaks under them. They are submerged, and all are overwhelmed, men, horses and coach, in the icy water. They may also be compared to those who make a little boat of reeds and canes, which they daub with pitch to make it hold together. On it they launch into the deep; but there the pitch is washed away, and they are drowned in the waters of the ocean, swallowed up and buried in its depths.<p>

<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;Mohammad, the founder of Mohammedanism or Islam, A.D. 571-632, was born at Mecca, where his father was spiritual and temporal head. He married a wealthy and devout widow, and owed much to her influence. In the visions to which he was subject he received confirmations of his Divine mission. He also received messages from Gabriel which were incorporated in the KORAN, the sacred book of Mohammedanism. Early persecution drove him from Mecca and in the year A.D. 622 he fled to Medina, where he was cordially welcomed. This flight, or Hejira, marks the beginning of the Mohammedan year, and from Medina he set out on his conquest of Arabia. Mohammedanism proclaims the unity of the God-head, and condemns idolatry; but the peaceful methods of propaganda soon gave place to ruthless persecution of infidels and merciless extermination of idolators. </p>

[3] Ex his nunc fit hoc conclusum, quod omnis, qui vult vere Christianus esse, et a Christo salvari, credere debeat, QUOD JESUS SIT FILIUS DEI VIVENTIS; qui hoc non, credit, sed modo quod sit Filius Mariae, implantat sibi varias ideas de Ipso, quae damnosae et destructivae salutis illius sunt, de quibus videatur supra <a href="90.htm">90</a>, <sup "fn120_12">12</sup>
<a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="102.htm">102</a>; de his simile potest dici quod de Judaeis, quod loco coronae regiae imponant Capiti Ipsius coronam ex spinis, et quoque quod dent Ipsi acetum bibere, et clamant, si Filius Dei es, descende de cruce[, <a href="3927/matthew_27_29.htm">Matthaeus 27:29</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_27_40.htm">40</a>]; aut sicut dixit diabolus tentator, si Filius Dei es, dic, ut lapides hi panes fiant, aut si Filius Dei es, mitte Te deorsum, <a href="3927/matthew_4_3.htm">Matthaeus 4:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_4_6.htm">6</a>. Hi Ecclesiam Ipsius et Templum Ipsius profanant, et faciunt hoc speluncam latronum. Hi sunt, qui Cultum Ipsius faciunt similem cultui Mahumedis, et non distinguunt inter verum Christianismum, qui est cultus Domini et Naturalismum: assimilari possunt illis qui feruntur curru aut rheda super tenui glacie, et glacies rumpitur sub illis, et submerguntur, ac illi et equi et currus aqua glaciali operiuntur. Assimilari etiam possunt illis, qui naviculam contexunt ex juncis et cannis, et conglutinant illam pice, ut cohaereat, et super illa se immittunt in pelagum, sed quod ibi conglutinatio picea solvatur, et illi suffocati aquis pelagi absorbeantur, et in fundo ejus sepeliantur.<p>
