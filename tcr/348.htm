<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第348节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>348</b>.从上述内容清楚看出，信通过三件事在人里面形成：首先是靠近主；其次是从圣言学习真理；再次是照真理生活。由于这三个阶段彼此截然不同，故可知，它们有可能被分离。有人可能会靠近主，但却不知道关于神和主的任何历史真理。有人可能通过圣言知道大量真理，却没有照之生活。但是，凡将这三个阶段分离，也就是说，有这个而无那个的人，都没有得救之信。当这三个阶段结合时，得救之信才会产生，事实上，这信的性质就取决于它们结合的程度。这三者在哪里分离，哪里的信就象不育的种子，若落在地里，就会腐烂成尘；这三者在哪里结合，哪里的信就象地里的种子，能长成一棵树，并且树还会照着它们的结合而结出果子。这三者在哪里分离，哪里的信就象不能生育的蛋；这三者在哪里结合，哪里的信就象能孵出美丽鸟儿的受精蛋。<br />对那些将这三者分离之人而言，信好比熟鱼或熟蟹的眼睛；而对那些将它们结合起来的人而言，信好比从玻璃体液直到虹膜的葡萄膜都清澈透明的眼睛。三者保持分离之信好比在黑石上用暗色调所作的绘画；而三者保持结合之信则好比在透明的水晶上用美丽色彩所作的绘画。三者保持分离的信之光好比夜里旅客手里的火把之光；而三者保持结合的信之光则好比火炬之光，当被挥动时，它能照亮每一步道路。缺乏真理的信就象结出野葡萄的葡萄树；而源于真理的信则象结出能酿美酒的串串葡萄的葡萄树。缺乏真理的对主之信，好比出现在穹苍中的一颗新星，随着时间流逝会变得黯淡；而拥有真理的对主之信，则好比一颗固定的恒星，永远长存。真理是信的本质，因而真理的性质决定了信的性质；没有真理，信是游移不定的；而拥有真理，信则是稳定的。而且，基于真理的信在天上闪耀如星辰。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #348 </h4>
<p>
348. 據以上所述可清楚看出, 在人裡面形成信的三件事情是:首先, 接近主; 其次, 從聖言學真理; 第三, 憑藉所學真理去生活。因為這三個階段各自明顯不同, 可以區分開來。一個人可以無需知道任何關於上帝和主的真理也可以接近主。人們也可以從聖言學到很多真理, 並不一定要活出這些真理。但是人若將此三個階段分割開來, 也就是說, 有其一無其它, 他就沒有獲得拯救他的信。這樣的信, 只有在三者聯合起來時才會產生, 並且信的性質如何取決於三者聯合的程度如何。
<p>此三者若分割開來, 信就如同不能發芽的種子, 播在地裡, 逐漸腐爛溶於泥土。然而, 三者聯合的信, 就如同地裡的種子長成一棵樹, 此信所結的果子如何則取決於三者聯合程度。三者分割, 信如同孵不出雞的蛋; 三者聯合, 信如同孵出可愛雞仔的蛋。
<p>將三者分開的信, 如同煮熟之魚蟹的眼睛; 而三者聯合的信, 如同清澈活潑的眼睛, 眼液透明在瞳孔處轉動。三者分開之信, 如同一幅畫用陰暗之色作在黑石上; 三者聯合之信, 則如同一幅畫用美麗色彩作在清澈水晶之上。
<p>將三者分割開來, 這樣的信所發出的光好比遊客在夜晚提著一塊燒紅的煤炭所發的光; 而將三者聯合, 這樣的信則如同手電筒發出的亮光, 晃動照亮路上的每個角落。
<p>缺乏真理的信如同結少量野葡萄的葡萄樹; 由真理構成的信則如同結出一串串能釀美酒的上等葡萄之樹。
<p>缺乏真理而對主的信, 好比一顆新星顯在空中, 一會兒便昏暗朦朧; 擁有真理而對主的信, 好比一顆固定不變的明星, 永遠長存。
<p>真理是信的實質, 因而真理的性質如何決定了信的性質如何。沒有真理, 信則飄忽不定; 有真理, 信則穩如泰山。基於真理之信, 如同空中明星閃耀。 </p>

348. From what I have said just above it is clear that there are three things that form faith in us: first, turning to the Lord; second, learning truths from the Word; and third, living by those truths. Now, because there are three parts to the formation of faith and each one is not the same as the others, it follows that they are separable. People could turn to the Lord and not know any truths about God and the Lord except things they had been told in the past. People could also know a great many truths from the Word and still not live by them. People for whom these three things are separated, meaning that they have one but not another, do not have a faith that will save them. A faith begins to have saving power when these elements are connected. The quality of the faith depends on what kind of connection the three have.
<p>Where these three elements are kept separate, the faith there is like a sterile seed planted in the ground that breaks down into dust. Where these three elements are interconnected, the faith there is like a seed in the ground that grows into a tree whose fruit reflects the nature of their connection. Where these three elements are kept separate, the faith is like an unfertilized egg. Where they are interconnected, the faith is like a fertilized egg from a beautiful bird.
<p>The faith of people who keep these three elements separate is like the eye of a fish or a crab that has been cooked. The faith of people who interconnect these three elements is like an eye that is clear right through from the vitreous fluid to the pupils uvea. Faith in which these elements are kept separate is like a painting done with dark colors on a black stone. Faith in which these elements are connected is like a painting done with beautiful colors on a clear crystal.
<p>The light from a faith in which these elements are kept separate is like the light of a glowing coal in the hand of a traveler at night, while the light from a faith in which these elements are connected is like the light of a blazing torch that makes each step clear as it is moved back and forth.
<p>Faith without truths is like a vine that bears a few wild grapes. Faith made of truths is like a vine that bears bunches of high-quality grapes that yield excellent wine.
<p>A faith in the Lord that lacks truths is like a new star that appears in the sky but then dims after a while. A faith in the Lord that has truths is like a fixed star that endures forever.
<p>Truth is the essence of faith. Therefore the quality of the truth determines the quality of the faith. Without truths, faith wanders around; with them, it stays in one place. In fact, a faith made of truths shines in heaven like a star. </p>

348. It is plain from what has been said above that there are three things which form faith in the case of a person: the first is to approach the Lord, the second is to learn truths from the Word, the third is to live by them. Since these three stages are distinct one from the other, it follows that they can be separated. One can approach the Lord without knowing any but historical truths about God and the Lord. One can also know large numbers of truths from the Word without living by them. But the person who has these three stages separated, that is to say, one without the other, has no saving faith. This sort of faith comes about when the three are linked together, and indeed the nature of the faith depends upon the degree to which they are linked.<p>Where the three are separated, there faith is like infertile seed, which when put in the ground dissolves into dust; but where the three are linked, there faith is like seed in the ground which grows up into a tree, and the fruit of that faith is dependent upon their being linked. Where the three are separated, faith is like an egg lacking any fertility; but where they are linked, faith is like the fertile egg of a beautiful bird.</p>
<p>
[2] In the case of those with whom the three are separated, faith can be likened to the eye of a cooked fish or crab; but faith with those who have them linked together can be likened to an eye which is rendered pellucid by the crystalline humour right up to and through the uvea of the pupil. Faith separated is like a painting made with colours of dark tones on a black stone, but faith linked is like a painting done with beautiful colours on a pellucid crystal. The light of separated faith can be compared with that of a fire-brand in the hand of a traveller at night, but the light of linked faith can be compared with the light of a torch, which when shaken lights up the details of the path. Faith without truths is like a vine which bears wild grapes; but faith derived from truths is like a vine which bears clusters of grapes yielding a fine wine. Faith in the Lord devoid of, truths can be compared with a new star appearing in the sky, which grows dim in time, but faith in the Lord accompanied by truths can be compared with a fixed star, which lasts permanently. Truth is the essence of faith, and therefore the nature of truth determines the nature of faith; without truths it is errant, with them it is stable. Faith based on truths also shines in heaven like a star. </p>

348. From the foregoing it is clear that there are three things by which faith is formed in man; first by going to the Lord; secondly, by learning truths from the Word; and thirdly, by living according to them. Now as these are three things, and one not the same as another, it follows that they can be separated; for a man may go to the Lord, and not know any but historical truths respecting God and the Lord; also a man may know truths from the Word in abundance, and yet not live according to them. But in the man in whom these three things are separated, that is, in whom one is apart from the other, there is no saving faith. Saving faith arises when the three are conjoined, and becomes such as the conjunction is. Where these three things are separated, faith is like a sterile seed, which when dropped in the earth moulders into dust. But where the three are conjoined, faith is like a seed in the ground which grows up to a tree, and the fruit of it is according to their conjunction. Where these three things are separated, faith is like an egg which contains no prolific principle; but where they are conjoined, faith is like an egg that can produce a beautiful bird. The faith of those in whom these three things are separated, may be likened to the eye of a fish or of a crab when cooked; but the faith of those in whom the three are conjoined, may be likened to an eye translucent from the crystalline humor even to and through the uvea of the iris. Separated faith is like a picture drawn in dark colors on a black stone; but conjoined faith is like a picture drawn in beautiful colors on a transparent crystal. The light of a separated faith may be compared to that of a firebrand in the hand of a traveller at night; while the light of a conjoined faith may be compared to that of a blazing torch which when waved about shows plainly each step of the way. Faith without truths is like a vine bearing wild grapes; but faith from truths is like a vine bearing clusters full of noble wine. Faith in the Lord destitute of truths may be compared to a new star appearing in the expanse of heaven, which in time grows dim; but faith in the Lord together with truths may be compared to a fixed star, which remains constant. Truth is the essence of faith; therefore, as the truth is, such is the faith; without truths it is a wandering faith, but with them it is fixed. Moreover, faith from truths shines in heaven like a star. </p>

348. From what has just been said, it is now evident that there are three means by which faith is formed in man, namely, firstly, by approaching the Lord, secondly, by learning truths from the Word, and thirdly, by living according to them. Now, since there are three means, distinct from one another, it follows that these may be separated. For a man may approach the Lord, and yet not know any but historical truths concerning God and the Lord; and another may know truths from the Word in abundance, and yet not live in accordance with them. With the man, however, in whom these three things have been separated, that is, in whom there is one without the others, there is no saving faith; but this faith arises when the three are united, and its quality depends upon the nature of the union. Where these three things have been separated, faith is like barren seed which, when sown in the earth, molders into dust; but where they are united, faith is like a seed in the earth which grows up into a tree, yielding fruit in accordance with their union. Again, where these three things have been separated, faith is like an infertile egg; but where they are united faith is like a fertile egg, that produces a beautiful bird. Faith, with those in whom these three things have been separated, may be likened to the eye of a boiled fish or crab; but in those who have united them, to the eye transparent from the crystalline humor even to the uvea of the pupil and through it. Faith, in such a state of separation, is like a picture in dark colors, painted upon a black stone; but faith, when the three are in conjunction, is like a picture in beautiful colors upon clear crystal. Where these three are separated, the light of faith may be likened to the glare of a fire-brand in the hand of a traveler by night; but where they are united, to the light of a torch, which when moved about, shows up every step of the way. Faith without truths is like a vine bearing wild grapes; but faith arising from truths is like a vine bearing grapes that produce excellent wine. Faith in the Lord without truths may be likened to a new star appearing in the expanse of heaven, which in time fades away; but faith in the Lord, accompanied by truths, may be compared to a fixed star, which endures for ever. Truth is the essence of faith; therefore such as is the truth, such is the faith. Faith without truths is unstable, but with them it is fixed; and in heaven faith that is formed of truths shines like a star. </p>

348. Ex supra dictis patet, quod tria sint per quae formatur Fides apud hominem, nempe quod Primum sit adire Dominum, Secundum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
veritates ex Verbo discere, et Tertium vivere secundum illas; nunc quia tria sunt, ac unum non est alterum, sequitur quod possint separari, potest enim quis adire Dominum, et non scire veritates de Deo et de Domino, nisi quam historicas; et quoque potest quis scire veritates ex Verbo in copia, et tamen non vivere secundum illas; sed apud hominem, apud quem tria illa separata sunt, hoc est, unum absque altero, non est Fides salutis; sed haec fides oritur, quando tria illa conjunguntur, et fides illa fit talis, qualis est conjunctio. Ubi tria illa separata sunt, ibi est Fides sicut semen sterile, quod missum in terram fathiscit in pulverem; at ubi tria illa conjuncta sunt, ibi est Fides sicut semen in terra, quod excrescit in arborem, cujus fructus est secundum conjunctionem. Ubi tria illa separata sunt est Fides sicut ovum, in quo non aliquod prolificum est, at ubi tria illa conjuncta sunt, est Fides illa sicut ovum prolificum avis pulchrae.</p>
<p>
[2] Fides apud illos, apud quos tria illa separata sunt, assimilari potest oculo piscis aut cancri cocti, at Fides apud quos tria illa conjuncta sunt, assimilari potest oculo pellucido a chrystallino humore usque in et trans uveam <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
pupillae. Fides separata est similis picturae ex coloribus trahentibus ex nigro super lapide nigro, at fides conjuncta est similis picturae ex coloribus pulchris super Chrystallo pellucido. Lux fidei separatae comparari potest cum luce torris in manu viatoris tempore noctis, at lux fidei conjunctae comparari potest cum luce facis, ex qua vibrata patent singula gressus. Fides absque veritatibus est instar vitis ferentis labruscas, at fides a veritatibus est instar vitis ferentis botros vini nobilis. Fides in Dominum expers veritatum comparari potest cum stella nova apparente in Expanso Coeli, quae tempore opacatur, at fides in Domino cum veritatibus comparari potest cum stella fixa, quae perstat in perpetuum. Veritas est essentia fidei, quapropter qualis est veritas, talis est fides, quae absque veritatibus est vaga, at cum illis est fixa; etiam fides veritatum lucet in coelo sicut stella.<p>
