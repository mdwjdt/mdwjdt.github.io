<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第68节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>68</b>. （7）人通过神性全能拥有反对恶与假的能力，通过神性全知拥有关于善与真的智慧，通过神性全在而在神里面，以至于他照着神性秩序存活。人越照着神性秩序生活，就越通过神性全能拥有抵抗恶与假的能力。原因在于，除了唯独神外，没人能抵抗邪恶及其虚假。因为一切邪恶及其虚假皆来自地狱，它们在地狱粘合为一体，正如一切良善及其真理在天堂合为一体那样。如前所述（65节），所有天堂在神面前如同一个人，而所有地狱则如同一个巨兽。因此，对抗一个邪恶及其虚假就等于对抗这个巨兽或整个地狱。除了神以外，没人能做到这一点，因为神是全能的。<br />由此清楚可知，人若不靠近全能的神，凭自己对抗邪恶及其虚假，就跟一条鱼对抗整个大洋，或一只跳蚤对抗一头巨鲸，或一粒尘埃对抗一座垮塌的高山那样没有任何力量，也跟一只蚱蜢与一头大象，或一只苍蝇与一头骆驼较量差不多。此外，人对抗邪恶及其虚假的力量如此微弱，是因为他就生在邪恶当中，而邪恶不会对抗它自己。综上所述，可知，人若不照着秩序生活，也就是说，不承认神和祂的全能，以及所赋予他对抗地狱的保护，并且他这一方若不与自己里面的邪恶斗争（因为这两方面都是秩序所要求的），他必会陷入地狱，被它吞噬，在那里受到邪恶的猛击，一波接一波，如同海上的小船受到暴风雨的袭击。</p>

68. (7)我們在生活中越遵循聖規, 就越能從上帝的全能獲取抵抗邪惡與偽謬的能力, 越能從上帝的全知獲取有關良善與真理的智慧, 並因上帝的全在而在上帝中。
<p>我們在生活中越遵循聖規, 就越能從上帝的全能獲取抵抗惡與偽的能力, 因為除非上帝——惟獨上帝, 無人能抵抗那些伴隨著人們的惡與偽。所有類型的惡與偽都來自地獄, 在那裡它們粘附在一起而成為一體, 所有類型的善與真在天國的確也是這樣成為一體。
<p>如上所述(第<a href="65.htm">65</a>節), 對於上帝而言, 全部的天國就像一個人。另一方面, 地獄像一個巨獸。抵抗某個惡與偽,就是抵抗地獄整個巨獸——除了上帝,無人能做, 因為祂是全能。
<p>於是很清楚, 除非我們向這全能上帝尋求幫助, 我們自己沒有絲毫抵抗惡偽的能力——如同一條魚與大海鬥爭,一隻小蟲與鯨作對,一粒灰塵與一座大山較力。我們自己, 擁有的抵抗惡偽的能力小過蝗蟲與大象或蒼蠅與駱駝較勁的能力。還有, 我們對抗惡偽的如此微弱, 是因為我們出生在惡中, 惡不能與自己作對。
<p>因此, 我們必須在生活之中遵循聖規。我們必須承認上帝, 祂的全能来保護我們抵擋地獄, 我們還要做好本份去與我們裡面的惡爭戰。如此承認和自行爭戰相互結合, 就是聖規的一部分。要不然, 我們就不得不陷入地獄,被地獄吞噬。一旦在那裡, 我們就不得不被一波接一波的邪惡推行, 就像大海中的小划船被風暴推行。 </p>

68. 7. The more we follow the divine design in the way we live, the more we receive power against evil and falsity from God's omnipotence, receive wisdom about goodness and truth from God's omniscience, and are in God because of God's omnipresence. The more we follow the divine design in the way we live, the more power we receive from God's omnipotence to fight against forms of evil and falsity, because no one can resist evils or the falsities that go with them except God alone. All forms of evil and falsity are from hell. There they stick together as one thing, exactly the same way all forms of goodness and truth do in heaven.
<p>As we said above [65], to God the totality of heaven is like one human being. On the other hand, hell is like one giant monster. Going against one evil and its falsity is going against that whole giant monster of hell - no one can do it except God, because he is omnipotent.
<p>Clearly then, unless we seek help from God Almighty we have no more power of our own against evil and falsity than a fish has against the ocean, or a gnat against a whale, or a piece of dust against a mountain that is falling on it. On our own, the power we have against evil is much smaller than the power a locust has against an elephant or a fly against a camel. Furthermore, our power against evil and falsity is even weaker because we are born into evil. Evil cannot act against itself.
<p>Therefore we have to follow the divine design in the way we live. We have to acknowledge God, his omnipotence, and our resulting safety from hell, and do our part to fight against the evil that is with us; this acknowledgment and this fighting go together as part of the divine design. Otherwise we cannot help being plunged into hell and swallowed up; and once there, we cannot help being driven by evils, one after the other, like a little rowboat on the sea being pushed around by storms. </p>

68. (vii) MAN HAS FROM DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE POWER AGAINST EVIL AND FALSITY, AND FROM DIVINE OMNISCIENCE WISDOM ABOUT GOOD AND TRUTH, AND FROM DIVINE OMNIPRESENCE IS IN GOD, TO THE EXTENT THAT HE LIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIVINE ORDER.<p>The reason man has from Divine Omnipotence power against evils and falsities to the extent that he lives in accordance with the Divine order is that no one, except God alone, can resist evils and the falsities they produce. For all evils and their falsities come from hell, and there they hold together as a unit, exactly as all kinds of good and so truths do in heaven. As I said before, in the sight of God the whole of heaven is like one man, and in the opposite case hell is like one monstrous giant. Thus acting against one evil and its falsity is like taking on that monstrous giant or all hell. No one can do this except God, because He is omnipotent.</p>
<p>
[2] It is plain from this that unless a person approaches almighty God, he can do no more against evil and so falsity than a fish against the ocean, a flea against a whale, or a speck of dust against an avalanche - much less than a locust against an elephant, or a fly against a camel. Moreover, a person has so much less power against evil and so falsity because he was born into evil, and evil cannot act against itself. The consequence of this is that unless a person lives in accordance with order, that is, unless he acknowledges God, His omnipotence and the protection this gives him against hell, and unless he on his part also fights with the evil in himself, for both of these are part of order, he must inevitably be plunged into and drowned in hell, and there buffeted by evils, one after the other, like a rowing-boat by squalls at sea. </p>

68. (7) From the Divine Omnipotence man has power over evil and falsity, and from the Divine Omniscience has wisdom respecting what is good and true, and from the Divine Omnipresence is in God, just to the extent that he lives in accordance with Divine order. It is from the Divine omnipotence that man has power over evil and falsity just to the extent that he lives in accordance with Divine order, for the reason that no one but God can resist evils and their falsities. For all evils and their falsities are from hell; and in hell they cohere as a unit, the same as all goods and their truths do in heaven. For, as has been said above, before God all heaven is like a single man; and on the other hand, all hell is like a single gigantic monster; consequently, to act against a single evil and its falsity is to act against that gigantic monster or hell; and this no one is able to do except God, because He is omnipotent. From this it is clear that unless man approaches the omnipotent God he has from himself no more power against evil and its falsity than a fish has against the ocean, than a flea against a whale, or than a grain of dust against a falling mountain; and much less than a locust has against an elephant, or a fly against a camel. Moreover, man has all the less power against evil and its falsity because he is born into evil; and evil cannot act against itself. From all this it follows that unless man lives in accordance with order, that is, unless he acknowledges God and His omnipotence, and the resulting protection against hell, and also on his part fights with evil in himself (for order requires both of these), he cannot but be immersed and overwhelmed in hell, and there be driven about by evils, one after another, as a skiff at sea is driven by the storms. </p>

68. (7) A MAN HAS POWER AGAINST EVIL AND FALSITY FROM THE DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE, AND WISDOM CONCERNING GOOD AND TRUTH FROM THE DIVINE OMNISCIENCE; AND HE IS IN GOD FROM THE DIVINE OMNIPRESENCE, SO FAR AS HE LIVES ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ORDER.<p>Man has power against evils and falsities from the Divine omnipotence so far as he lives according to Divine order, because no one can resist evils and their falsities but God alone. For all evils and their falsities are from hell, where they combine, forming as it were a unity, as do all kinds of good and their truths in heaven. As was said above, all heaven appears as one man in the sight of God, while hell is like a giant monster; so that to oppose one evil and its falsity is to oppose that monstrous giant, or all hell, and this no one can do but God, because He is omnipotent. From this it is evident that unless a man approaches the omnipotent God, he has of himself no more power against evil and its falsity than a fish has against the ocean, or a flea against a whale, or a speck of dust against an avalanche; and much less than a locust has against an elephant, or a fly against a camel. Moreover, a man has still less power against evil and its falsity because he is born in evil, and evil cannot act against itself. It follows, therefore, that unless a man lives according to order, that is, unless he acknowledges God, His omnipotence, and its protection against hell; and further, unless he, on his part, also fights against evil in himself, for both are implied by order, he must sink down to hell, and be there overwhelmed, driven about by one evil after another as a boat is tossed on the sea by storms. </p>

68. VII. QUOD HOMO TANTUM IN POTENTIA CONTRA MALUM ET FALSUM EX DIVINA OMNIPOTENTIA SIT, QUODQUE TANTUM IN SAPIENTIA DE BONO ET VERO EX DIVINA OMNISCIENTIA SIT, ET QUOD TANTUM IN DEO EX DIVINA OMNIPRAESENTIA SIT, QUANTUM SECUNDUM DIVINUM ORDINEM VIVIT. Quod homo tantum in potentia contra mala et falsa ex Divina Omnipotentia sit, quantum secundum Divinum Ordinem vivit, est causa, quia nemo potest resistere malis et inde falsis, quam Solus Deus; omnia enim mala et inde falsa sunt ex Inferno, et in Inferno cohaerent sicut unum, prorsus sicut omnia bona et inde vera in Coelo; nam ut supra dictum est, totum Coelum coram Deo est sicut unus Homo, ac vicissim Infernum sicut unus Gigas qui Monstrum, quare agere contra unum malum et inde falsum est contra monstrosum illum Gigantem seu Infernum, et hoc nemo potest nisi Deus quia est Omnipotens;</p>
<p>
[2] ex his patet, quod homo nisi adeat Deum Omnipotentem, contra malum et inde falsum ex se non plus valeat, quam piscis contra Oceanum, quam pulex contra balaenam, et quam pulvis contra montem cadentem, et multo minus quam locusta contra elephantem, aut musca contra camelum: et insuper homo adhuc minus contra malum et inde falsum valet, quia natus est in malum, et malum contra seipsum non potest agere. Ex his sequitur, quod nisi homo secundum Ordinem vivit, hoc est, nisi agnoscit Deum, Ipsius Omnipotentiam, et ex hac tutelam contra Infernum, tum nisi homo a sua parte etiam pugnet cum malo apud se, nam hoc una cum illo est ordinis, non possit aliter quam immergi inferno et submergi, et ibi agi a malis, uno post alterum, sicut cymba in mari a procellis. </p>
