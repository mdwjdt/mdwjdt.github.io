720. 然而, 切勿认为主向不配领圣餐者关闭天堂, 只要人尚在尘世, 祂就不会这样做。 关闭天堂的, 正是人自己, 他拒绝信, 生活邪恶, 从而关闭天堂。 然而, 人仍被不断保守在可能悔改与转化的状态中, 因为主始终临在, 并敦促被接受, 祂说:<p>我站在门外不断叩门, 若有听见我声音就开门的, 我要进去, 我与他, 他与我一同坐席。 (<a href="3927/revelation_3_20.htm">启示录3:20</a>) <p>所以, 若人不开门, 错在人自己。 死后情况就不同了, 那时天堂关闭, 不能对那些至死都不配领圣餐者敞开, 因为那时他们心智的内在早已固化和坚定了。 </p>

720. It is important that we not believe the Lord closes heaven to those who approach the Holy Supper unworthily. The Lord does not do this to any people, even to the final hour of their lives in this world. We ourselves close heaven to ourselves [while we are in this world], by rejecting faith and living an evil life. But even if we do this, we are still constantly kept in a state that leaves open the possibility of repentance and turning our lives around. The Lord is always present and exerting pressure on us to accept him. As he says, "I am standing at the door and knocking. If any hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and will dine with them and they with me" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>). We ourselves are at fault if we do not open the door.
<p>After death, though, heaven is closed to those who continued to approach the Holy Table unworthily to the end of their lives. Heaven can no longer be opened to them because the inner regions of their minds have by then become fixed and established. </p>

720. Yet it must not be thought that the Lord shuts heaven against those who approach the Holy Supper unworthily. He does not do this to any person up to the very end of his life in the world. It is the person who shuts heaven to himself, and he does this by rejecting faith and living a wicked life. Still the person is constantly kept in a state where it is possible for him to repent and be converted. For the Lord is perpetually at hand, urging His acceptance; for He says:<p>I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with me, <a href="3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>.<p>The blame, therefore, lies with the person himself, if he fails to open the door. After death the situation is different. Then heaven is shut and cannot be opened to those who right to the end of their lives have unworthily approached the Holy Table; for then the interiors of their minds are fixed and consolidated. </p>

720. Nevertheless it is not to be supposed that the Lord closes heaven to those who come unworthily, this He does to no man, even to the end of his life in the world, but man closes heaven to himself, and this he does by the rejection of faith and by evil of life. And yet man is held constantly in a state of possible repentance and conversion, for the Lord is constantly present and urging to be received; for He says: <p>I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice and open, I will come in and will sup with him and he with Me (<a href="3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>). <p>Therefore the fault is in the man himself, who does not open the door. It is otherwise after death; then heaven is shut and cannot be opened to those who have continued even to the end of life to come to the holy supper unworthily; for the interiors of their minds are then fixed and determined. </p>

Still it must not be supposed that the Lord shuts heaven against those who approach unworthily; this He does not do to any man, even to the end of his life in the world. The fact is, that the man shuts heaven against himself, by the rejection of faith and by evil of life. Nevertheless he is continually maintained in the possibility of repentance and conversion; for the Lord is continually present, and urgent to be received, for He says:<p>"I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" <a href="3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>.<p>The blame, therefore, lies with the man himself, if he does not open the door. It is otherwise after death. Then heaven is closed, and cannot be opened to those who, even to the end of life, have unworthily approached the Holy Table; for the interiors of their minds are now fixed and confirmed.<p>

Sed usque non credendum est, quod Dominus illis qui indigne accedunt, claudat Coelum; hoc non facit ulli homini usque ad extremum vitae ejus in Mundo, sed quod homo sibi ipsi illud claudat; quod facit per rejectionem fidei et per malum vitae; sed usque homo jugiter tenetur in statu possibili poenitentiae et conversionis; nam Dominus perpetuo adest et urget ut recipiatur, dicit enim, consisto ad januam et pulso; si quis audiverit vocem meam, et aperuerit, ingrediar, et COENABO CUM ILLO ET ILLE MECUM, <a href="3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Apocalypsis 3:20</a>: quare in culpa est ipse homo, qui non aperit januam.
