<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第10节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>10</b>.凡心智健全者，即便没有宗教信仰，也能明白，一切合成物若不依赖于某一个事物，必会自行瓦解。如，人由众多肢体、脏腑、感官器官和运动器官组成，它们若不依赖于一个灵魂，必会垮塌；身体本身若不依赖于一个心脏，也会如此。还有，一个王国若不依赖于一个国王，一个家庭若不依赖于一个主人，王国中的各种职务若不依赖于一个总管，同样如此。若一支军队没有一个拥有至高权力的指挥官，下属不服从他，而这些下属各自又没有对士兵的指挥权，这样的军队如何对抗敌人？若不承认一位神，教会，或天使天堂，就是地上教会的头，也一样，因为在那里，主是它们的灵魂。这就是为何天堂与教会被称为祂的身体。这二者若不承认一位神，就如同一具死尸，毫无用处，会被抛弃并埋葬。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #10 </h4>
<p>
10. 無論有無宗教信仰, 一切常理都會顯明: 組成一個整體的各個部分, 若不依附於某個事物, 都會淪為碎片。人就是這樣, 由如此多的肢體,內臟,感覺和運動器官組合成一個整體; 除非它們依附於同一靈魂, 否則就不復存在。或者身體本身必須依附於一個心臟。一個王國依附于一個國王, 也是同理。一個家庭, 依附於一個家主。每個王國都有許多種各樣的職能, 各自依附于各自的主管。一個軍隊, 如果若沒有一個有最高權力的首領,各個長官聽命于他, 並且每個長官各執其命管理士兵, 這樣的軍隊在對抗敵軍時能發揮戰鬥力嗎？教會若不接受一位上帝(上帝如同地上教會的頭)也是這樣, 天人的天國也是如此, 上帝就是教會和天國的真正靈魂。這就是為什麼教會和天國被稱為祂的身體。當教會和天國不接受一位上帝, 他們就如同一具死屍, 毫無用處, 不如拖走埋了。 </p>

<h4 align="center">True Christianity #10 (Rose, 2010)
</h4>
<p>
10. Every multifaceted entity falls apart unless it depends on one thing, a fact recognized by all sound reasoning whether religious or not. For example, a human being, made up of many limbs, internal organs, sensory organs, and motor organs all interconnected, would fall apart if it did not depend on one soul; and the body itself would fall apart if it did not depend on one heart. A country would fall apart but for its one monarch; a household would fall apart but for its one head; every one of the many workplaces in every country would fall apart but for its one person in charge. What army would prevail against its enemies without a leader who has supreme power, and officers with authority over their soldiers? Likewise a church would fall apart unless it acknowledged one God; and even the angelic heaven would fall apart. Heaven acts as the head of the church on earth; the soul of both is the Lord; this is why heaven and the church are called his body. So if heaven and the church did not acknowledge one God, each would be like a lifeless corpse that would be thrown away and buried because it was good for nothing. </p>

<p>
10. Anyone of sound mind, even if not religious, can see that anything which is divided must of itself fall apart unless it is dependent upon a single origin. For instance, a human being, who is built up of so many members, viscera, sensory and motor organs, would collapse if he did not depend on a single soul; so would the body, but for its single heart. In the same way a kingdom depends upon having a single king, a household on a single master, and every department of the administration, of which there are many kinds in every kingdom, upon a single official. How effective would an army be in fighting the enemy without a general in overall command, and officers subordinate to him, each exercising his authority over the common soldiers? It would be the same with the church, if it did not acknowledge one God; or with the heaven of angels, which is, so to speak, the head of the church on earth; there too the Lord is their very soul. This is why heaven and the church are called His body. If both did not acknowledge one God, they would resemble a lifeless body, which is cast out and buried, as being of no further use. </p>

<p>
10. All sound reason, even when it is not religious, sees that every composite thing would of itself fall to pieces unless it depended upon some one thing; as in the case of man, composed of so many members, viscera, and organs of sensation and motion, unless they all depended on one soul; or the body itself, unless it depended on one heart. The same is true of a kingdom unless it depends on one king; a household, unless on one master; and every office, of which there are many kinds in every kingdom, unless on one officer. What would an army avail against the enemy unless it had a leader having supreme power, and officers subordinate to him, each of them having his proper command over the soldiers? So would it be with the church if it did not acknowledge one God, or with the angelic heaven, which is like a head to the church on earth, in both of which the Lord is the very soul. This is why heaven and the church are called His body; and when these do not acknowledge one God they are like a dead body, which being useless is carried away and buried. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #10 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
10. Every person of sound reason, even when not under the influence of religion, perceives that a complex whole would fall to pieces were it not dependent upon some principle of unity, just as man, composed of so many members and viscera, with organs of sensation and of motion, is dependent upon one soul, and the body itself upon one heart. A kingdom also depends upon one king, a house upon one illustrious head, and every office, of which there are many kinds in every kingdom, upon one officer. Against an enemy an army would be of little use without a general in supreme command, with officers under him, each exercising authority according to his rank over the private soldiers. The case would be similar with the Church unless it acknowledged one God, and also with the angelic heaven, which is as the head of the Church on earth, and both the Church and heaven are animated by the Lord as their very soul. For this reason heaven and the Church are called His body; and if they did not acknowledge one God each would become like a life-less corpse, fit only to be cast out and buried. </p>

<p>
10. Omnis Ratio sana, tametsi non religiosa, videt, quod omne divisum nisi pendeat ab uno, ex se dilabatur, quemadmodum Homo ex tot membris, visceribus, organis sensoriis et motoriis contextus, nisi ex una anima; et ipsum Corpus nisi ex uno corde. Similiter Regnum nisi ab uno Rege; Domus nisi ab uno hero; et omnis functio, quae multiplex est in unoquovis Regno, nisi ab uno officiario. Quid Exercitus valeret contra hostes absque Duce, cui suprema potestas, et ei praefecti subordinati, quibus singulis suum jus est super milites. Simile foret cum Ecclesia, nisi illa agnosceret unum Deum, et quoque cum Coelo angelico, quod est sicut caput Ecclesiae in terris, in quibus Dominus est ipsa Anima; quare Coelum et Ecclesia Ipsius Corpus vocantur; quae nisi agnoscerent unum Deum, foret utrumque sicut inanime corpus, quod, quia ad nihil utile, projiceretur, et sepeliretur. </p>
